collective haul again over the past it's
not that long actually it's only been
like a month to sit in my last one but
all the stuff that I have bought so I
can show you what I have and hopefully
you'll like some of this stuff I didn't
want to get it too in there we can be
twins I'm not gonna let my mom with the
intro let's just get started with the
hall I think I'll start it close first
because I don't have that many but I do
so
first is what I have on it says you
weren't my cup of tea but I drink
champagne now oh I love it I think it's
so cute from Charlotte Russe um I don't
know I just think it's like super cute
as a hood it's comfy it's like a
sweatshirt but like sweater at the same
time I said very lightweight and I loved
it I could see myself wearing this to
the airport when it's a little cool
outside the globe lot I love it it's
kind of like cheesy the saying I
normally wouldn't wear stuff like this
but I kind of in love so I bought it
um also I'm Charlotte Russe I got this
tank top cold shoulder shirt so it hangs
up your shoulder and then as those
sleeves it says like rock and roll
festival again kind of cheesy not my
normal style but okay be a bitch not my
normal style but I was like I don't have
a shirt that's like this I could wear
under like a leather jacket I kind of
look badass you know so I was like why
not and so I picked that up in this and
that is what I got from there then I
just got this random shirt from Kohl's
like I don't know what I was doing but
considering I'm going to Disney World
this summer I decided to just get this
like lightweight white Mickey Mouse
t-shirt it's very flowy super cute I
know I'll wear this a lot even if I'm
not in Disney it's so soft that I was
like why not it's not like weird or
anything it's just Mickey Mouse hugs
like that's perfect I know where it is
neat so got that from Calvin Klein I got
a couple and performance shirt which
I've always wanted one of these and it's
just gray and it says
Calvin performance on the front line
client and the rest of performance on
the back it's just funky this is like a
hanger hook so sorry if it's a little
string thing but um lightweight grey
like I like the little like um seam
right here it goes across it's very
different and I don't know I really like
Calvin Klein stuff I mean I haven't
mentioning like my Calvin set so I was
like let's just get a shirt - from
Target if you probably see this and you
follow my musically it's the medicine
Axford
I just got this shirt which I would
never buy
and that's been happening to me lately I
just find stuff that I wouldn't normally
get but I love this
don't be basic and it's like Star Wars
and I'm in love
I wear this so much like it needs to be
washed but um I just had to show it
because I got a recently so it should
still be a target if you office as well
I loved this like this is saying I
normally wouldn't buy I'm not huge star
best man at all but I was like hey I'll
be a fig yes how I wouldn't wear this
pretend like I like Star Wars when
really I just like the saying don't be
basic never Brady Melville I'm never
sure I'd never order from I was like why
not just spent like $50 here right so I
got this skirt which I love it's a zips
all the way down the front it's really
really cold right now but once I sits
all kind of annoying because if you're
not like a zero to two it's like is this
stuff gonna fit I don't know it's
annoying
so it is a little short but I really
like it I like the like blueish black
and white stripes on the front I love
the zipper um accoutrement so I got that
skirt which I have like no skirts I only
wear like jeans and dresses so that was
new for me and then I didn't even
realize that I didn't have like a
sweater dress so this is a black sweater
dress it's actually not that long it
looks super long as what the hell but
it's not that long once it like form
fits to your body it is very very tight
and body con and it becomes a lot
shorter but I love it just a black like
a sweater material like ridged um
material so I love that and I didn't
haven't that closet and when I had in my
card I was like I own this and so I went
in my closet and like looked around I
was like I don't have a little buck
dress that's just I kind of casual you
can dress it up with heels dad just a
down with combat boots whatever I don't
have that so let's so I needed it
um I didn't realize I had this obnoxious
stack like right here can you not be
thank you
sorry we'll just go to this next cuz I
forgot I had left it here um best fight
like why was they invest buy I don't
even know I got awkward season 1 &amp;amp; 2
it was on sale so it's like why not I've
never seen this show I know don't hate
me and I don't know why cuz it's such a
teenage show and came out 2011 or 12 11
I think um always want to see it never
knew a channel MTV was on and always too
lazy to look it up and it's not on
netflix i think it's on Hulu but I'm not
gonna buy it Hulu and I'm Netflix and
I'm not going to buy it off iTunes so
then I saw one on DVD and I love DVDs
because you can watch whenever it's not
like Netflix that will take things away
or iTunes or you need Wi-Fi sometimes
like yeah I got it hard copy so I've
never seen
since they only had season 1 and she
that I could find like it comes together
when did you so I was like okay it was
$10 how can I pass it up so I'm excited
watch this heard tons ago reviews
everyone loves it every was always tell
him on high school and I was like like
so I'm doing this Jenna I don't know
where some piece of that medicine so yes
I got this awesome tastic that I got I
mean this where poetry phase wish
actually it's my junior year I was into
writing poetry girl it actually wasn't
that bad but like will sing that for a
different video but um I love reading
poetry so first book poetry X went crazy
and bought a bunch of amazon so first
poetry book that I got is dirty pretty
things by Michael fedo today how do you
say that I don't know oh my god I love
this book definitely give this if you're
injured interested in poetry into
writing poetry into reading poetry so
want to start reading poetry give this
as a start it is a little journey if
you're under the age of 16 17 I'd say
like beware
it can get a little raunchy but like
overall the messages and like the love
theme that seemed throughout I love and
my friend Lisa have the same book I'm
really here
I love this book it's great it has like
little it's a long poems it's adorable
and I love this like light Rose a cream
color and like the little black little
girl and if I love it great book for my
collection then I got two more just
because why not first one is chasers of
the light poems from the typewriter
series by Tyler Matt Gregson
it's a hardback so all they had and
they're all typed as like looking like
as if it was written on a typewriter I
love reading these kind of things no
matter what mood I'm in Harvey said in
love and hate you know whatever
I love reading this kind of stuff I love
it did I remember the books they're like
I spy that's not smells like never
forget and then I got milk and honey
which is a super popular poetry book and
it's like black and white pages great
illustrations then I got this really
random I don't know I included this like
who cares but aquaphor chapstick I guess
you could say moist lip moisturizer
um this is expensive and I always hear
everyone be like oh my god I gotta get
my like I'll go for like aqua walk for
like everyone always use this this was
like the dermatologist recommended like
oh my god it's amazing and it it's very
thick almost like Vaseline which you
keep Leary Vaseline for 94 cents instead
of like four or five dollars which this
was
and be fine and this I don't like to
stay my sheets like I put one on before
I go bed right like doo-doo-doo-doo
glass of lips and I guess when I was
sleeping like it stained my pillowcase
and I was like it's oil-based - so you
can't get it off that easily if at all
so that's kind of knowing I mean it is
moisturizing but I feel like Bethenny
would do the same thing um
next I got Burt's Bees Niva cream and
Brits face cleansing well qui channel
moment for birthdays making makeup
things what I saw these and freaked out
so I had to get him I got the shade
light because we land on my foundations
always tea tired and has SPF 15 in it
amazing so I'll show you a little what
it looks like it is a very thick good
coverage which I like for a BB cream but
at the same time is a little bit wet
which was also great for easy blending
so that is the light color it is very
light and it smells kind of weird I
can't my finger on yet like it first was
like honey and then feet so a little
alarmed but excited to try it all the
same oh my god perks please Kenz
cleansing oil which if you don't know
this is like a makeup breakup liquid so
I was using my booshka
boscia Boesky emotion yeah I don't know
how you say that okay uh makeup breakup
cleansing one which Allah loved to death
and this is the same thanks ever smells
like these legs so and you like I like
how big this jar is for nothing
expensive and get it at our wall my
drugstore so definitely check it out I
love it I love I rarely use makeup wipes
anymore which is good because makeup
wipes weren't really getting all the
makeup off my skin so what I'll do I
need your routine on this um I'm gonna
do is I'll use this first to break down
my makeup before I go in with a um
rotating brush but I really like it I
really do so yeah moving on I got this
pure moonlight glow palette which is a
strobing highlight palette I haven't
watched this yet but I don't like cream
highlighters and when I got this I was
like that's a cream highlighter and
I love powders because there's so much
easier to apply without moving a
foundational around cuz sometimes when
you have um creams they get very sticky
almost and tacky picking up the
foundation you just set and moving it
all around showing discoloration redness
so this is the palette you have your
like light one your pink one your
bronzing month so this is that first
color the highlighter on my finger
um yeah I don't really like this that
much like sorry then we added pink rose
blush color I'm not living for this
sorry Brown bronzing I'm not I really am
pissed because I thought it was gonna be
a powder I'm gonna see that bronze one
which is pretty but I don't I can't use
creams unless I have no foundation on
because I'll just move all my makeup
around so I'm a little a little unhappy
I thought it was gonna be powder I would
choose powder any over any day like I'm
sassy a glow kick gleam my not this
then I got max bronzer and give me son I
like it it's very expensive it's one of
their mineralized skinfinish bronzers
beautiful beautiful orange red color and
then there it is on my three fingers and
there's a sparkle what with that um you
can see their great color payoff it's
just very orange II when it goes on the
skin you cannot use a lot of this or
you'll be screwed your makeup will get
screwed remember you can always add more
you can't take it away makeup wise so I
like it wouldn't buy it again just
warning you then I have this little I
gots from Walmart this little face
shaver I love it it's like it's my
mustache unibrow eyebrows sideburns
everything gone everything grows because
girls we do have facial hair it's light
but it's there so you got to get rid of
it and I love it I use it almost every
day I don't have that much hair I'm just
saying like I'll see like little things
grow back it'll be like an acid a bitch
so yeah that's why I have done this
lifesaver because I ain't got time if we
can do acts everyday so sometimes when
my face needs a little use that then I
got send bdellium tools um lip chubby
lipsticks set so I'm gonna go through a
swatch these for you real quick okay so
the first one we have is Helen of Troy I
love the names of these by the way I
haven't seen the formula what the colors
yet so I'm very excited okay it's a roll
up so we can start here ooh yes know
what that reminded me I was like in
Hercules Meg's color dress I love these
um they're easy to blend out but they
still stay really pigmented
I love that that's so cool I really like
formal on these night just on that so
okay Helena Troy next is Kaddu mint or
okay it's more of a red salmon than an
orange but I'm living this texture so
creamy and smooth definitely check these
out um in the nude yes doesn't like my
favorite color to wear you see that
third one right there I love nude
lipstick I always wear it everyday um I
love these they're so creamy and just
buttery and smooth a glide right on
sinister Rouge sinister yes come on
doesn't evil in lipstick yes plum purple
I love it pink Cadillac names they're
all like pink purple Reds like no I like
Browns bog Sophie marilyn is the next
one this better be a red yes there we go
Kyle looks the same as this one but I
love it true red right there these are
so cute they're called Auto lip crayon
and then lil red is the last one yes
that is a true red right there
yes replicate a replica of Ruby will
love that and I just have to keep those
swatches tattoo I love these so cool
definitely check out bdellium tools I am
for sure going to next I got the
original RC ma no color powder this is
translucent powder used to sense what
like drag queens use the actual makeup
use it use this in stuff like that I
like this it says it doesn't alter the
car your foundation which it doesn't but
it leaves a cake face okay your makeup
will not move but it leaves the cake
face so if you want that natural dewy
look don't use this this for heavy duty
like my under-eye better not crease kind
of look so like pack it on you can the
bake or just rub it on and it works well
I've never seen creasing that's for sure
but at the same time it's so thick I
don't know if I'd repurchase it and use
a lot each time like you have to use a
lot it goes down very quickly this is
after like maybe a week use then I got
another tree hut Shea sugar scrub this
time in this the smell moroccan rose it
is the best rose it's like my favorite
scent it smells oh good mmm I got it at
Walmart it's the most unbelievable smell
I like Brendan the last two I got and
this is my favorite exfoliator it's so
cheap and that's the job Ulta Target
Walmart
no not Target ultra warmer it's the most
amazing smell you have to trust me on
this go get shea sugar scrub because
they're so cheap for exfoliators then I
got green marble setting spray now this
I was dying to try because
again what jenkins used with theatrical
makeup uses like broadway and step to
step she was makeup and actually it's
like a little green more book in it okay
i'm very very okay my opinions on this
all the time sometimes i love it it does
the job your makeup does not move but
there's a lot of cons to it it burns
like a mother okay
hey it shoots it into your eye like it
doesn't spray if they keep it like 900
miles away from your face her to work
correctly um it smells like straight
rubbing alcohol and it puts a sticky
film on your face does your makeup move
no and that is the biggest pro because
it's so hard to find a setting spray
that actually does the job of setting
your makeup and instead of just kind of
moving around making you wet and dewy so
yes this will stay can make up for days
until you rub it off and scrub it off
which i love
but there's a lot of painful cons to
this like it smells better and handling
me is like nasty alcoholic fumes
basically it hurts it hurts so bad but
do you want your makeup to last or not
so i do like it
you have to shake it every time before
you use that i don't know if i'd get it
again honestly just cuz it's a little
scary and I'm always here I'm like
swallowing it because it's so stronger
than alcohol smell but oh well next I
got my perfume which is my favorite
perfume ever it's called Lila for the
essence in Norway this is what they saw
in a Epcot Disney Norway's little
pavilion little store I love it I got it
from Nordstrom it wasn't $90 but I was
like it smells amazing it literally
smells like my childhood of going to
Disney it's just the greatest smell if
you can't afford it or you don't want to
afford it totally understandable at
least just go to Nordstrom if you have
it on you and smell it cuz it smells so
good or if you disney go into the norway
store and this is what it smells like
i love this and my favorite cream
everywhere it every definitely know what
it smelled like it's that next I got
blends smart a revolution in makeup
application brush so I saw this at
Sephora and it's a brush that apparently
you don't have to buff in it just twirls
for you so you would initially like
nothing when applying your makeup
oh yes to do is like sit there so they
have a blush brush head a foundation
brush head and a powder brush head I'm
pretty sure I got the foundation one but
anyway you just like hold it there and
apparently it's supposed to move so
we're gonna just now try it out on my
hand I haven't done it yet so this is
what it looks like it comes with a
battery it's like I'm just gonna pop
this in its again by the brand blintz
I'm so excited you get online and that's
for it here's the first tip in and I
think they're interchangeable so if you
buy the other 100 you can just pop it in
what oh oh I'm in love
okay it's a very smooth applicator I
just have my ratchet fit me foundation
it's not rush it was perfect I love it
I'm gonna put a little on okay not the
entire bottle you dip and I guess I'm
just gonna blend it on my hand I hope
you can see that okay let's go let's see
if I don't it's mood room oh I mean you
have to slightly guide oh oh it's
beautiful
the the finish of that you guys are
slightly guided or up I just blended it
all in wait I'm in love and only got
like nine bristles dirty wait hold up
I'm gonna do it again
you like tickles this is so amazing oh
my god okay if you're not gonna buy it
which is fine at least go try it at the
store because it'll change your mind I
cannot wait to use this now because I'm
using a medium under amazing but it gets
tiring after a while like then change it
and slightly moving around but it kind
of does the twirling the stippling for
you love that and that's the end of our
video I hope you enjoyed if not write to
mom to subscribe my channel my first
time gonna do believe me in the rest of
song here and tape it later for more
videos I post new videos every week
