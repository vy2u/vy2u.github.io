went to Mac today kind of unexpectedly
and spent a lot of money like a lot I
got a big bag Bruins no no I knew I
wanted to go there and I knew I wanted a
lot of stuff so you know like I can make
my own money and I save it up for when I
really want to splurge on things and I
you wanted a lot for way back to college
because I don't have the opportunity go
to stores that much out there or at all
and Mizzou stuff but to throw a mole and
buy stuff up in a by step and the month
so I'm going to show you what I got I
already cracked into it all so I can
have the empty boxes in here but my pugs
have all been used and I like them all
so without further ado let's let me show
you what I got today
so boots hey guys another Studio Fix Mac
powder foundation my sister got me look
for my Christmas for Christmas not for
my Christmas for Christmas and and it's
great but I want to shade lighter or
shade or two lighter um so I got NW 30
it's what it looks like and this is what
I'm wearing right now foundation so it's
still really dark this is all I have on
I'm no liquid foundation it's just
powder and it looked a lot light on that
it kept it really got more into my face
and this looked a lot lighter so I
bought this because it was lighter I
love it but like I know a lot of you
every like it's still too dark and it is
I know but I thought it's gonna be this
shape and obviously it's not really the
shape but I still have I'm gonna use it
all the time obviously and it's nice to
just have this very light rather than a
heavy foundation everyday so yeah
NW 30 in Studio Fix powder foundation
then I got Q
Mac Paint Pot first one I got is an
obvious it's painterly paint-pot
I mean that's just a given that I had to
get this how did I not own Mac painterly
paint-pot everywhere does it it's a nice
eyeshadow primer base and I have it on
right now since page me
this is pain early if you can see that
you might not pick up that much it's
very nude and I also got Mac Paint Pot
in bear study it's just a nice pearly
shiny color and you can almost wear this
just and eyeshadow not just a bait so
that's exciting Anna so I think that one
up as well bear study it's more of a
pearly color
you can see that difference there
because I just picked up so much more
than painterly from Santa I got max i
layer I : smolder I just heard so many
great things about this but I let it and
I was running low on my Rimmel one so I
said why not just splurge I'm at Mac so
I got this
here's smolder it's just very dark black
eyeliner just great then I got two
eyeshadows first was just a black it's
just a typographic matte black so easy
yet is just totally dark black and then
the second one I got is itself brown eye
shadow which is just a nice can't really
see those are gonna pick up but I have
it as like a base color on top clearly
but my eye shadow look today that I did
it make it look on it's just a nice
color tough round to start with like in
your crease before any eye shadow that
you put on then I got a highlighter
which I was between High Beam or max
pearl but I decided to go with Max pearl
since I was there and it's just very
very um you can see I'm running out
space very very pearly and shiny
the name is true to the color and um I
really like this happen on cap on my
nose and my cheekbones
I got a shadow brush it's Mac 219 it's
just a nice little like quite a brush
like a muse um in my Creed and also
under my eye you can use under shadow on
my lot wider line and then I think this
is the last thing I got is what I have
on right now so I'm not gonna swatch it
cuz I hate like running my lipsticks on
my hands but it's just Mac's lipstick in
myth it's like a nice nude color and
that's why my lips look so like my skin
right now but I love that everyone raved
about myth like just like faded angel I
also have angel um but yeah everyone
raves about the myth like it was like
one of the top MAC lipsticks like how do
you get so fix it up because I really
wanted a new nude color and it also
today it's not from Mac but I picked up
my first into cosmetics brush from all
I love it - flat top kabuki and I use it
to buff in my studio fix powder from Mac
and I love that I really love how firm
it is yet it's so soft and like easy to
move the powder around so definitely
check out it it cosmetic brushes it
brushes roll jump there's like $25 but I
love that my I went back and hit set up
so that was my Mac Hall in my bit brush
