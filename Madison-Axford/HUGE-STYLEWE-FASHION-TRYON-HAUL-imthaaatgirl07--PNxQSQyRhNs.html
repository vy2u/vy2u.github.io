from a great online store I got to my
new favorite style we I've done a few of
halls with them included in it but today
is a trial dedicated to only Salvage so
let's just get started you know what to
try and haul ass I'm gonna shut closed
but I gotta get quite a bit um I believe
and I'll try them on and that will like
overlap this so let's get started first
thing that I'm wearing it's this white
dress that I adore it's a little tight
I got a size small it's a little tight
just know that um everything will be
linked to the down right don't worry you
can find the same stuff as me we can be
twinsies anyway so this is a dress and I
really like it it's like has this kind
of I don't even know what this is lace
all the way down to the bottom and then
also has these cutouts right here I
think it's just adorable I love it it's
super comfy it's like I said it is a
little tight but and the same time comfy
I love the like Lacey through sleeves
and I just love this dress is fun seem
pretty and perfect for the summer
because it's lightweight and white so I
love it level of it and yes I just think
it's like super cute I love this that
it's kind of revealing but not at all at
the same time so like yeah you can see I
have boobs we don't see my boobs okay I
don't know I really like it
anyway moving on I got this which I'm
really worn in a video it's a cold
shoulder white top it's very like
chiffon like material very thin here the
sleeves they cinch at the wrists which I
like and then it's very very thin
spaghetti strap around the neck and then
here is off the shoulder cold shoulder I
love that it is a little deep of a cut
on the side so you just wear sticky
boobs with it but not a problem at all I
love it I love these little gold details
on the tie in the front and this is
super cute it's like the right length it
just goes with everything and I'm super
sated with us alive like I said the day
I got it I already wore it in a video so
that shows that I really love it um and
I really got making money so I already
stained it
no but I loved it so much I love the
little cut right here in the front again
so the boobs can come out and play and I
just love the shirt it's very thin and
lightweight so you can wear it in the
hot summer days but it's still long
sleeves so II yes the best of both
worlds while I'm on the topic of summer
I got a huge winter coat okay everyone
in colleges at least moving colleges
I've been to 7 Billy 20 right there were
these long black puffy coats it's not
just like oh a puffy coat or a North
Face like there's a some College trend
that I was missing out on
apparently until now that's a long like
weighed you right above like mid
half-english area puppy black coat so I
had to get one and it's going to give me
so warm yet it's so stylish and you can
dress it up dress it down wear to
college class wear to a musical like
freakin anywhere like you can make it
fancy or not and I really like it has a
hood it has like the feather it has the
feathers like within it to make it like
puffy and soft and I love it I'm so glad
I finally have this and they had a for
decent price because there's a lot like
from Michael Kors and stuff like that
better super expensive and I was like
not having it so I got a cheaper one and
I loved him so excited whereas during
the winter because now I'll be warm and
stylish the next thing is my favorite oh
my God look at this skirt just oh look
at it might be a princess yeah it's a
high-low which I usually met a fan of
but it's so roughly and like there's so
many different layers and textures and
tiers of just tulle and beautiful fluff
I love it I this is so random for me in
every I guess a small but the waist is a
little big so you can't wear it almost
as a high waisted thing because it is a
little bit of a waist elastic fan but
it's fine it's just the most beautiful
freakin vintage like wedding dress
anything ever I love it my mom's like
where you gonna wear that I'm like no
but I'm gonna wear the time I feel so
beautiful in it and it sounds cheesy but
I just like love wearing it because it
makes me feel like a princess or like
literally I'm getting married like it's
the most beautiful tool thing ever I
play around them it's so fun I just love
the different tiers and how texture to
looks and looks like princess freakin
gown bodice love it to death so like
that up because it's my favorite thing
from sowwy ever
next I got another like princess like
gown gown dress I was very into this
kind of like fancy textured dresses and
skirts look at this oh it is a little
long a little big but we make it work
it's this beautiful beautiful baby pink
rose color and then the top on this is
lace and jewels and studs and
rhinestones and laced on the sleeve and
detailing and it's beautiful and I love
it crisscross back detail on the neck
hemline I love it so much I'm gonna a
lot of you side of this for fancy things
if it's Easter you know just like
certain event so you can wear this too
might be hard but I don't know I need a
hug for my collection it's like one of a
kind of felt like I just needed this
piece it's so fancy and beautifully I go
to the Met Gala next year
I'm gonna wear this I have to I'm
totally random indifferent and this is
just a plain black slip like literally
it's a slip dress I can just address
most slip I don't know I co do that
crisscross back very plain very simple
very silky tight form-fitting I love it
it's just so simple and it's me kind of
long on the long side for a dress pair
with some heels maybe about cinched at
the waist and there you go it's
literally just a slip dress and I didn't
have one I was like every nice has those
and I don't so little my dress look like
just your book you've got it then I got
this which is kind of random it's just
like a white sweatshirt but that thing
it bothered me it's like the zipper when
he zip it down unzips two more fabrics
like it doesn't show see it was just
kind of read like ratchet to me as a
hood it is thick and it would be great
like go into airports or in the
wintertime and think it does have
pockets this awkward flip thing that
leads to nothing but this just what I
use there fabric kind of anyway it's
still cute and I will wear it it just
confuse me when I unzip the zipper but
you like guys I'm going to add a
sweatshirt to my collection I love
sweatshirts
so let's say I got is matching set and
what I love about Selby I've said before
is their material is so thick and I
durable and I love it it feels like nine
sweaters put together so this is the
skirt it splits open in the back I love
like peep openings in the back like this
on skirts beautiful tribal design orange
black and white and the top is a sweater
like design long sleeves crop but this
sort of so high-waisted that it shows
barely any if any stomach I love this
it's gonna look so bomb together and yes
I have a pair with some little boots
little heels it is very thick though so
be careful if you are going somewhere
hot don't wear that because you like so
