I'm really excited about because it's
very very rare that i do one of these
videos and it's a haul video I'm doing a
huge summer beauty haul all from Target
and I'm very excited to do this but
without further ado let's get started so
I'm going to dive right in the first two
things actually aren't really beauty
related but are more like skin related
and they're my favorite self-tanner
lotions by banana boat this summer color
self-tanning lotion and deep dark color
they provide amazing amazing amazing
color they do not make you orange or
squatchy at all I just love the stuff I
use it every day almost and it it's just
it's great i love the stuff in the
summer i love it so i got two more
bottles of those is super cheap like six
bucks and i use it all the time and it's
like my moisturizers tanning lotion but
it's very very cheap and is the best
formulation around that I found at least
moving on the next thing I have in here
is an elf eyeshadow palette that's it
the shades to escape and I have an eye
this palette ever since I like first
started with makeup and I love the
colors in this I just think they're
absolutely gorgeous they're so so so
beautiful the blues i love blues and
aquas and turquoise and colors like that
and very excited to do a makeup tutorial
in the future using this palette um it's
just great it has a base lid crease and
liner color and in marks like what each
color is supposed to be used for and I
just love this then I also got a second
thing from ELF which is a flawless
concealer brush however i'm going to use
it for a blending brush for my crease
because i was looking at my brush
collection and i don't actually have a
blending brush it sounds actually two
brushes but nothing really to blend when
I put my crease color on my lid so this
is a great huge fluffy brush I can go
deep into the eyelid crease and I'm very
excited I grabbed this it says concealer
brush you can obviously use it for that
but i think i'm going to stick to
eyeshadow with this one the next thing I
see in here is my favorite foundation
advert the covergirl outlast stay
fabulous three-in-one foundation with
SPF 20 and the reason I got another one
of these is not because I'm out is
actually because I have been tanning
outside and with my self tanner lotion
doing boats to touch the emmys and
lotion the st. all fake I juice my time
outside but um I got a darkish color
because I got a lot of comments on video
saying that my foundation was too light
for me which it wasn't at the time but
now it is that I'm using more lotion in
tanning and going outside more it is
becoming a bitch too late for me switch
got a shade darker or two shades darker
actually because they were out of the
shade darker in 832 nude beige but I'm
glad that I got a darker shade because
my other one was very very light so what
I'm wearing right now as you can see
it's not the best nah nothing that's a
mismatch neck face body fake no not dude
not doing too good right now the next
thing I have in here is a big mega
effect l'oreal mascara is the new one
I've seen a lot of beauty Greer's
picking this up recently so I thought I
would grab it as well it's around six
seven dollars and I'm surely excited to
try this I'm a mascara junkie I tons
mascaras i'm using for right now now
five I guess it may seem a little
excessive in ridiculous but I love to
try all different kinds of mascaras with
different wants and get different
benefits and results from all of them
today I'm really excited to try this I'm
a huge fan of Lori almost here so the
best with that one then I got another
bronzer I have my cooler bronze which I
love and I use it all over my face but
I'm a lot of meteors were using things
recently like body bronzers and things
to just make sure that all the skin
tones in their upper body and chest and
neck were matching their face so I got
this huge one from Rimmel it's a Sun
shimmer shimmering maxi bronzer in the
shade 001 sunkiss it's literally bigger
than my face I'm so excited to use this
and it's very very dark but I'm just
planning on using this may be on my face
because I used it in a tutorial today
and I liked it but I do love my hoola
bronzer a lot more because it is so high
quality and it's so Matt and this one's
a bit sparkly there's that by that plan
is this on any discoloration that I may
have my upper chest or neck regions to
just make sure everything's blended and
matching perfectly then I got two
eyeshadows and these are the infallible
eyeshadow from l'oreal I love L'Oreal so
much i guess and i use this one in
10,000 videos it was in my may favorites
video is 892 amber rush this is my
favorite favorite eyeshadow other it's
literally like putting gold on your
eyelid so this is definitely my favorite
I haven't tried this one yet but this
one is in the shade 889 midnight blue
and it's just
deep deep navy cobalt blue and I'm so
excited to use this with my elf palette
that i got in this hall as well and yes
i just love these so much they're just
so beautiful that 24 hours it lasts
forever and yeah the last four things I
got our lipsticks I went lipstick crazy
because I was realizing that I only
really had like three lipsticks I denude
a hot pink and like a raspberry red and
I didn't have so many colors and I want
to do all these new looks and tutorials
and summer makeup videos you know what
all that kinda stuff and I needed some
new lipsticks to help me do the job in
those so I did go a little bit a little
bit crazy but I'm glad I picked these
all up the first one is definitely my
favorite it's from Maybelline is the
Shane 905 brazen fairy and it's
literally a purple I can't even wait to
try this I literally will be the person
that's wearing purple lipstick out in
public and I don't even care i'm so
excited this is so beautiful and I'm
glad I finally picked up a purple
lipstick as part of maybelline's like
vivid lipstick collection and I got a
second lipstick from billings vivid
collection in the shays 870 shocking
coral I had a coral from a color l'oreal
colour reach lip balm but I ran out of
it so I got this new coral color I love
this color just has a simple everyday
look um because you know I don't want to
wear purple or hot pink every day I went
to where you know a nice little coral
calming pink color that's you know
politically correct did not like
obnoxious even though I'm pretty much
obnoxious um but I'm excited to just try
that simple little color it was just
kind of a last minute thing that I
picked up in case I needed a color the
rest of these were like I went to target
intentionally to get these because I was
planning on doing makeup tutorials using
these colors the next color we got is
from Rimmel London as part of the kate
moss red collection or lipstick
collection and it's just a beautiful
beautiful red I had a raspberry red
that's kind of pinkish reddish this is
just a true true true red I'm excited to
finally have a true red because I don't
have a red everyone is a classic red lip
you know so i finally got a red lipstick
that's very nice and match in the last
thing that i got in this target beauty
haul was wrong revlon is just super
lustrous lipstick in the shade 677 siren
and i'm one of this color so badly not
this particular brand or anything but
this color because
it's orange and orange purple are
definitely this cup this summer's big
huge trending colors especially orange I
so loud and obnoxious and it's not a
quarrel it's not a red so I don't think
it's an orange but oh my god I'm so
excited to try these crazy colors that I
picked up and yes i'm glad i got the
orange as well so that was my huge
summer beauty haul from target i hope
