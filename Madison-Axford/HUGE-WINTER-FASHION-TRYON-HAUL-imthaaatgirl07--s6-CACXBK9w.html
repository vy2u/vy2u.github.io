again I love these videos they're so fun
and I don't really do that because I
never really buy the stuff I don't get
clothing it's so rare for me so with my
black of them and I'm doing a chinam
haul from the look bookstore it's an
online store I love it it's kind of so
much like fashion event stuff like that
but it's so different at the same time
and I just love the clothing selection
on this store it's just incredible it
really is it's very well known even if
you haven't heard of it like yeah almost
like I think over 2 million followers
Instagram like they're the shiz and I
bought a lot of stuff from that a long
time ago and I just have this cat purrs
from them it goes on and on on our
relationship but our my relationship
with that store but yes I have some new
stuff to show you today so that further
ado let's get into the try at home the
first thing I have is this super super
cozy huge huge huge sweater I throw this
on over everything all-time leggings
pants jeans even more flat heels tennis
shoes whatever this thing is on me it's
just a huge nice like corduroy almost
looking sweater it's this nice tan color
and it does have like a button right
here that will hook it closed it's just
so big and cozy if you can see this like
I love it I love it so so much it is so
warm and this can replace like my North
Face sometimes when it's not like super
duper cold but it's still cold enough to
wear jacket I wore this and I just think
that much more fashionable they thought
to be real I love this is a great choice
on my part I think I love it next I got
some dresses because I knew the holidays
Christmas New Year's are coming up and I
want to have a bigger selection of
dresses I had worn before it to choose
from for those holidays so the first
thing I got is this black backless dress
this is the front it's just beautiful
about black sparkly sequins like oh my
god um it's pretty long it doesn't go
below my knee but it is pretty long
above the knee dress and then I started
this impairment and the back is just
backless like it is scandalous but not
like I love it it's show classes like
Great Gatsby I feel when I'm wearing
this I feel so classy and I'm living so
you got really sticky boobs are saying
with this you can't wear like a brought
back because you'll see it but I adore
this it looks so good on and I just feel
like I'm literally am
we start when I'm wearing it then the
other dress I got is a little big for me
a budge I make it work
it is this rose gold spaghetti strap to
res and that has these cutouts on the
side it's like a little silver cuddle on
the side of this four on each side
yeah it doesn't cut down too far I know
it looks a little low-cut it's not that
low-cut and it kind of gaps here like
drapes and again it's above the knee
it's a beautiful beautiful color I like
in love with a glittery sparkly dress
like that's my thing
I love sequin dresses so this is another
great one to add to my collection and I
have a dress that I actually wore on
Thanksgiving I adore this it's so so
comfy yet so cute there's this gray
asymmetrical dress you can wear it this
way or this way I chose this way in the
front I don't know why but I like it and
then it's asymmetrical so it's like
high-low sideways so one side is higher
than the other and the other drapes down
like that I adore this I love the color
grey is one of my favorite colors to
wear and it's just like a soft like
legging material but in a dress and I've
ever heels and looked fencing it off so
yeah then I got this matching set the
reminded me of clueless here are the
bottoms like they're a little big on me
to be honest so I may have to pair them
with a belt or something because they
are a little big and wrinkled apparently
she's like you can see how big that leg
is it doesn't fit very well but the top
I wear all the time it's so cute I
already got makeup on it so you know but
I love it is this it's a crop so again I
usually like to cover my stomach I don't
not ashamed of it or anything like I'm
so confident with it but I just don't
like my midriff just hanging all the
time so I'll usually pair this with
really high leggings or where the jeans
are saying like that but it's very very
cute I like this light kind of blue
denim almost like pattern or fabric or
whatever but yeah these two came
together and a matching set and they
have tons of matching sets on line so I
wish I would have got more because
they're adorable but now I know that the
pants are a little big for me then I got
this army ish green jacket these are so
in and this one is huge huge huge
shoulder pads which I am living you can
see that like this is squishy that's all
shoulder pad it has a beautiful like
prism like studs on both shoulders and
then
these like double flaps right here and
then it is a crop as well this is a
little small I think I got a hair with
say I got a us a US size four and it is
a little small I wish I would have got a
size up so just know that these do were
on very small these jackets but I adore
it like look at the detailing on that
holy crap it just makes anything you
wear yet again like look fancier and
look like that much more put together
and the last thing I got is this it's
actually a onesie unitard
lead hard thing um so it does go all the
way down as a bodysuit but it is like
this shirt this long-sleeve black shirt
are very very in right now and I had to
pick one up even though it is a little
scandalous and a little cold right now
during the season to wear this by
besides that I do enjoy this I really
liked it and I knew I wanted this as
soon as like when on the website like
this is why I went there to find one of
these because I know I went to pick one
up just for my collection so hope you
enjoyed this haul definitely check out
