all of the cute little Disney role
designs around the room hey um so today
I'm gonna do a hotel room tour I'm
staying at the Key West resort in Disney
World for my spring break trip so I
thought I'd do a quick room tour for you
so here's my door Baloo so let's just
hop right in okay so you walk in and the
first thing you see are these two doors
right here for extra storage I guess we
don't really need them you have a mirror
there's me and then this little table
thing so we're going to go into the
first room right here and here's a
closet for storage um the bathroom is in
here
very very big there's a shower and a
bath and this one and I love the colors
it's so like blue it is just beautifully
painted and then here's another sink out
here which I love these sink carpet
areas I love those when rooms have those
and then two towels my dad were to use
this so it's all wet and gross and a
trash basket and so then this is the
first room overview there's two beds so
for me and my sister here's my sisters
and here will probably be mine and then
you got another closet we won't use any
of these because when we come we don't
really unpack our suitcases we just
leave the stuff in there I mean we only
stay for a week so then there's this
little dresser and um a nice flat-screen
TV and this all these dresser drawers
and then a cute little table a light
above it and I just think this is so
cute I don't know if we use it but maybe
I can edit videos here and then just
some cute little pictures all on the
wall and that's the first room that's
like right when you come in here is
behold kitchenette living area and it's
huge oh my goodness so first you have
this chair with an ottoman in the corner
two couches a table this little island
right here which is really really cute
we I don't think we'll ever eat like a
meal here maybe a breakfast but I really
doubt it so we will probably eat out so
we won't get much use out of this but
it's nice to have all this open space
and
it's really amazing so comes to all
these appliances and this cute little
bow dish towl that's tied on to the oven
and then there's like literally
everything like you could live here this
refrigerator microwave toaster
coffeemaker dishwasher everything it
comes with dishes as well and then
here's this nice huge kitchen table in
case we were to eat here and then my bag
my sister's bag my mom's bed and our
luggage hasn't come yet because being
like delivered to our room so I just I
just thought I would film this really
quick and I love all the hidden Mickey
things and all of the cute little Disney
roll designs around the room and this
resort so moving into this with the door
this is the first bedroom moving into
the last hallway and the last bedroom
this is so big but first you have a
washer and dryer so you're right and
it's amazing because literally you can
do all your laundry before you even go
home and it's super super nice and then
you got this cute little map artsy and
then you move into the last bedroom and
you have the bedroom and you have the
last bedroom and the huge huge huge
bathroom so this is the king bed um for
my parents so they made this cute little
flower out of towels and washcloths and
put it on the bed I love this little
design it's really really cute and then
you just have another chair over there
and then you have the TV it's another
flat-screen in here and a huge gesture
that will not be used by my family and
then this little like stepstool ottoman
thing you can sit on and then lastly
moving on to the master bath or just
whatever you want to call this this is
huge to Hue tub it's amazing it has this
window that overlooks the bedroom which
i think is just so so so here I'm in
love with it there's this little exceed
if you didn't want to get in the jacuzzi
bath sink and then this huge chunk and
show on this little thing in case I want
to put your toiletries on that and we go
into the last room which is another part
of the bathroom you have this huge sink
top again
hi gar hi a toilet and another shower
that's like pink and I love this old
fashioned e color pastel like how the
room is painted thing is so so so cute
and quaint and I love staying here we
usually stay at Key West resort which is
this one for the grandpa Rhydian but we
did it today though this time and then
lastly we have this beautiful patio that
overlooks a pool of our hotel so I think
this is a pretty boss view you can see
the little pink and white little
shutters on the other rooms and yeah
there's a really nice pool there's like
three pools at this hotel resort and
then there's a little table in case we
would eat we would want to eat out here
and the patio is just amazing so I hope

West resort and yes I'll be staying here
