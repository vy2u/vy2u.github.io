outsider that's okay we all have those
days be no to me today I'm doing how
much a big hunt but into video I get a
lot of requests to do this or how to
build confidence let's start I'm saying
that I started from the bottom now I'm
here started from the bottom now my
whole team here started from Bahia yeah
if you get what I'm saying we started
from the bottom but now we're here so if
you think you can never be confident
don't worry you hadn't be there's no set
rule or set steps on how to really be
confident if you know what I'm saying I
was rule I know you don't wanna hear
like I was bullied story again but I was
bullied and it happened a lot in middle
school and then my senior year was
really rough but I mean it wasn't like
rough on me it was just like the
bullying was rough but I made it through
obviously I just wanted people to know
that I was bullied and no matter how
confident or you know like I don't know
what the word is gonna sound cocky but
every day even we can use cocky
if I see him talking now it's I totally
don't mean to be like that but I have
come a long way and I worked my way up
and I'm like so sad but it's so true
because I was so upset and I thought
nothing would ever get better but like
know that if things aren't better yet
then it's not over like don't give up
you know things will get better and if
it's not then it's not the end you got
to keep going
I get a lot of smack also on YouTube but
it doesn't bother me because I've grown
to think thicker skin because I can tell
you right now that when I was younger I
did not have a fixing and I was not
confident I didn't know what the word
confident was until like high school
because I was so afraid that people
wouldn't like me for who I was or people
were thinking negative thoughts about me
and I still have that sometimes but I've
grown to just be comfortable for myself
and love myself and then know that you
know and know what everyone's gonna like
you but people will like you and they
will accept you not everyone but some
people will so anyway being confident at
first honestly you have to fake it you
have to pay confidence so now she's
gonna be given to you like an a on the
paper no matter how hard you work for
husbands it's not
just gonna come like that because it's a
boy like that it doesn't make sense um
but anyway so you need to fake it at
first at least that's what I did I
pretended to have confidence especially
in like freshmen sophomore years of high
school and even junior I really just
like kind of put on this sense of
confidence that was like my personality
even though I was not confident on the
inside and I would just kind of walk
right on start around my heels at school
and people would talk about me and I'd
pretend like it didn't bother me and it
did at first my first viewers high
school you know it did bother me but I
wasn't gonna let people see this that's
like a key thing not letting people see
that you're defeated or that you're sad
or hurt by their words then they're less
like you to keep coming after you and
you just got your confidence up anyway
about my senior year of high school and
my freshman year of college I have
confidence now I'm like no for being
confident which is amazing and I really
try to stress for all my you know my
friends and my youtube subscribers to
become fierce a competent divas and it
sounds like some cheesy little thing oh
oh Hewson happenin DuBose ha ha ha but
um I just saw a spider holy crap oh my
god my heart literally just like one in
my throat why stress that so much is
because I was never fierce if you want
to use that term and I was never
confident as a little girl and so it's
so important to me now that's what I
want from this channel is at least one
person to gain confidence to know that
they can be whoever they want to be they
can do whatever they want to do and they
do not have to take crap from anyone and
they should love themselves and just you
know be thankful for everything that
they're given and really just own their
life like you only get one life and
that's what this channel is mainly for I
do makeup I do fashion but the main
thing on the channel is for you guys to
learn to become confident and happy in
your own skin and your own body and just
live life and that's another thing you
will literally have one life it's it
seems you know kind of stupid but um
just say that like Oh Yolo you only live
once but if you actually think about it
you don't have that much time on earth
and so it's like let you know live every
moment to the fullest another kind of
clean
a stupid term but if you actually think
of it like we literally stop and think
like life is oh short and I try to say
that when I'm having panic attacks I'm
gonna have eggs at me I'm like pheasant
life is so short no one's gonna care
about this one test or this one boy or
this one whatever this one event you
know no one's gonna care in the long run
my mom always tells me you know such a
short amount of time just get over the
hump you'll be fine because God wouldn't
give you anything you couldn't handle
how many people struggle with body image
or just like you know loving their self
it's hard at times because of society
and like just peers in general and and
and everything it's just it's really
really hard to get to the point where
you're like I'm happy with myself I love
myself I love everything about me I
applause could I accept them I'm
imperfectly perfect you know that kind
of stuff I'm not gonna just sit here and
be like yeah I just got to fake it and
then you be confident because it takes a
lot and I wish if you just drink like
this sort of potion and become confident
but I had to go through a lot to get to
where I am but I believe that every
similar you can do just the same because
if I can make it through any of you guys
can seriously you got this girls so
you've got this I believe in you and if
I believe in you you can do it oh but I
just have this like sense of confidence
on Vina so whenever I walk around I mean
I don't hold like you're rude and I
think some people think that I mean
sometimes I think some people think I'm
very what's the word intimidating um and
not looking a good way but like they're
kind of scared I've been told that
before I people were scared to talk to
me products I'm like and I don't mean to
look like a B you know but that kind of
is first of all just like my resting
face is just kind of like I kind of like
I'm pissed off but I'm really not but um
I'm just confident and I'm happy and I'm
just like owning it confidence isn't
about being rude to others or thinking
you're better than others and I don't
want you to get that from this video
either I don't want you to think oh if
I'm confident that means I love myself
and I'm better than everyone else no no
no no confidence means that you have
accepted yourself fully and you are not
going to let anyone beat you down no one
can bring you down no one can call you
names no can make fun
you love yourself you've accepted
everything and once you've accepted
things no one can bring you down for
that I feel like well you is it and
you're like I have it but I'm working
that's it or feels like you're
overweight or you're too skinny or you
can't wear heels or YouTube channels
stupid or bla bla bla bla bla
you just gotta let it roll up your back
it's so hard to do I know oh my god is
it hard it is but you just gotta breathe
know that you can do this know again
that I got through it and so many people
look up to you which thank you so much
that means so much to me that you look
up to me um it's in if I can honestly
get through and get through all just
this stuff that I had to go through for
my YouTube channel and for the stuff I
wore and stuff like that then I know you
guys can too because I would wear some
pretty crazy things and I would put some
pretty crazy things up in my youtube
channel and you know I knew that they
were gonna get some you know crap for
like what I was wearing and what I was
saying eventually you grow and you get
through it and I realized I was like I'm
happy with this I have 48 thousand
people who are watching me and who like
to watch my videos and think that you
know my making tutorials are good or
that actually care about what I have to
say so the two or five or whatever
people at my high school that didn't
like me back Alicia is saying you guys
have their life because I know I'm going
to have a good life because I've
accepted myself thanks I know what I
love to do
I'm had made myself and I know a lot of
it we're gonna be like I don't know how
to be happy with myself I don't know how
to like what I see in the mirror I don't
know how to just be confident and
stretch down the hallway again like I
said just try to fake it at first and
you'll understand that you only have one
life to live you're yourself you can't
really change yourself unless you want
to go to plastic surgery which why would
you do that so you know I think I used
to like um my face I used to not like
you know how you could see my ribs I
didn't like my hips eyes I didn't like
how I couldn't wear like certain clothes
I didn't like my purple hands
I have except today's you're you you are
beautiful
trust me each person in this world is
different there's nothing you know even
identical twins there's nothing
different about them and so that's just
amazing so accept yourself because
there's only one you and you have to
rock you cuz no one else can be able to
rock you you have to be able to do that
like no one else can be like Madison
no-nos can be exactly like me or look
like me so I have to work the best I can
out of this but I have you know but I
have and you want to love it you want to
be happy with it so I hope this video
