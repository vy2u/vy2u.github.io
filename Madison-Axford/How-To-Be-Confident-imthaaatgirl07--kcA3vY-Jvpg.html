lopsided that's okay we all have those
days we noted me today I'm doing you how
much your big hunt footage video I get a
lot of requests to do this or how to
build confidence let's start a from
saying that I started from the bottom
now I'm here started from the bottom now
my whole team here stop the phone pata
nahi oh yeah if you get it when I'm
saying we started from the bottom now
we're here so if you think you can never
be confident don't worry you hadn't be
there's no set rule or set steps on how
to really be confident if you know and
I'm science I was I know you don't wanna
hear like bullied story again but I was
bullying and it happened a lot in middle
school and then my senior year was
really rough but I mean it wasn't like
rough on me it was just like the
bullying was rough but I made it through
obviously I just wanted people to know
that I was bullied and no matter how
confident or you know like I don't know
what the word is gonna sound cocky but I
birthday even we can use coffee if i
seemed talking out its i totally don't
mean to be like that but i have come a
long way and i worked my way up and um
Mike so sad but it's so true because I
was so upset and I thought nothing would
ever get better but like know that if
things aren't better yet then it's not
over like don't give up you know things
will get better and if it's not then
it's not the end you gotta keep going I
get a lot of smack also on YouTube but
it doesn't bother me because I grown too
thick thicker skin because I can tell
you right now that when I was younger I
did not have a fix can I was not
confident I didn't know what the word
confident was until like high school I
was so afraid that people wouldn't like
me for who I was or people were thinking
negative thoughts about me and I still
have that sometimes but I've grown to
just be confident for myself and love
myself and then know that you know know
what everyone's gonna like you but
people will like you and they will
accept you not everyone but some people
love so anyway being confident at first
honestly you have to fake it you have to
pay confidence now she's going to be
given to you like an a on the paper no
matter how hard you work for confidence
and smell
just gonna come like that because it
doesn't work like that doesn't make
sense um but anyway so you need to fake
it at first at least that's what I did I
pretended to have confidence especially
in like uh freshman sophomore univ of
high school and even junior I really
just like kind of put on this sense of
confidence um that was like my
personality even though I was not
confident on the inside and I would just
kind of walk right on start around my
heels at school and people will talk
about me and I'd pretend like didn't
bother me and it did at first my first
few years high school you know it did
bother me but I wasn't going to let
people see this that's like a he think
not letting people see that you're
defeated or that you're sad or hurt by
their words then they're less lucky to
keep coming after you and you just got
your confidence up anyway but my senior
year of high school and my freshman year
of college I have confidence now I'm
like no for being confident which is
amazing and I really try to stress for
all my you know my friends and my
YouTube subscribers to become fierce of
competent divas and it sounds like some
cheesy little thing o.o her piercing
happenin to you buzz hahaha but um if I
just saw a spider holy crap oh my god oh
my heart literally just like one of my
throat why I stress that so much is
because I was never fierce if you want
to use that term and I was never
confident as a little girl and so it's
so important to me now that's what I
want from this channel is at least one
person to gain confidence to know that
they can be whoever they want to be they
can do whatever they want to do and they
do not have to take crap from anyone and
they should love themselves and just you
know be thankful for everything that
they're given and really just own their
life like you only get one life and
that's what this channel is mainly for i
do makeup i do fashion but the main
thing on the channel is for you guys to
learn to become confident and happy in
your own skin and your body and just
live life and that's another thing you
literally have one life it's it seems
you know kind of stupid but um just say
that like Oh Yolo you only live once but
if you actually think about it you don't
have that much time on earth and so it's
like let you know live every moment of
the bull is another kind of cliche
stupid term
if you actually think of it like we
would surely stop and think like life is
Oh short and I try to say that when I'm
having panic attacks when I have anxiety
and Mike pheasant life is so short no
one's gonna care about this one test or
this one boy or this one whatever this
one event you know no one's gonna care
in the long run my mom always tells me
you know such a short many times get
over the hump you'll be fine um because
God wouldn't give you anything you
couldn't handle so many people struggle
with body image or just like you know
loving their self it's hard at times
because of society and like just peers
in general and and and everything it's
just it's really really hard to get to
the point where you're like I'm happy
with myself I love myself I love
everything about me I applause could I
accept them I'm imperfectly perfect you
know that kind of stuff I'm not gonna
just sit here and be like yeah I just
got to fake it and then you be confident
because it takes a lot and I wish if you
just drink like a super potion and
become confident but I had to go through
a lot to get to where I am but I believe
that every small you can do just the
same because if I can make it through
any of you guys can seriously you got
this girl so you've got this I believe
in you and if I believe in you you can
do it oh but I just have this like sense
of confidence on veena so whenever I
walk around I mean I don't look like
you're rude and I think some people
think that Emma sometimes I think some
people think I'm very what's the word
intimidating um and not looking a good
way but like they're kind of scary I've
been told that before I feel worse care
to talk to me probably sound like and I
don't mean to look like a bean you know
but that kind of is first of all just
like my rustic faces just kind of like I
kind of like I'm pissed off but I'm
really not but um I'm just confident and
I'm happy and I'm just like owning it
confidence isn't about being rude to
others or thinking you're better than
others and I don't want you to get that
from this video either um I don't want
you to think oh if I'm confident that
means I love myself and I'm better than
everyone else no no no no no confidence
means that you have accepted yourself
fully and you are not going to let
anyone beat you down no one can bring
you down no one can call you names no
can make fun
you love yourself you've accepted
everything and once you've accepted
things no one can bring you down for
that if people like what you have is it
and you're like mmm I haves it but i'm
working at it or if you're like you're
overweight or you're too skinny or you
can't wear heels or you youtube channel
stupid or blah blah blah blah blah you
just gotta let it roll up your back it's
so hard to do I know oh my god is it
hard it is but you just gotta breathe
know that you can do this no again that
I got through it and so many people look
up to me which thank you so much that
means so much to me that you look up to
me um and in if i can honestly get
through and get through all just this
stuff that i had to go through for my
youtube channel and for the stuff i wore
and stuff like that then i know you guys
can too because i would wear some pretty
crazy things and i would put some pretty
crazy things up in my youtube channel
and you know I knew that they were gonna
get some you know crap for like what I
was wearing and what I was saying
eventually you grow and you get through
it and I realized I was like I'm happy
with this I have forty-eight thousand
people who are watching me and who like
to watch my videos and think that you
know my mega tutorials are good or that
actually care about what I have to say
so the two or five or whatever people at
my high school that didn't like me back
Alicia is sign you guys have a good life
because I know I'm going to have a good
life because I've accepted myself I know
what I love to do I'm had with myself
and I don't like we're gonna be like I
don't know how to be happy with myself I
don't know how to like what I see in the
mirror I don't know how to just be
confident in stretch down the hallway
again like I said just try to fake it at
first and you'll understand that you
only have my life to live give yourself
you can't really change yourself unless
you want to go get plastic surgery which
why would you do that so you know I
think I used to like um my face I used
to not like you know how you can see my
ribs I didn't like my hip size I didn't
like how I couldn't wear like certain
clothes I didn't like my purple hands
but I have accepted it you're you you
are beautiful trust me each person this
world is different there's nothing you
know even identical twins there's
something different about them um and so
that's just amazing so accept yourself
because there's only one you and you
have to rock you cuz no one
can be able to rock you you have to be
able to do that like no one else can be
like Madison no one else can be exactly
like me or look like me so I have to
work the best I can out of this but I
have you know but I have and you want to
love it you better be happy with it so i
