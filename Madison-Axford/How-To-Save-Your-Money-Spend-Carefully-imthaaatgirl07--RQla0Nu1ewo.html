I'm doing a video on how to save money
and how to spend your money that you do
want to spend and have carefully and
this is a very interesting video I
believe because i feel that i'm very
very good I don't want to brag on myself
but I do feel like I'm very good at
saving my money knowing what i'm
actually gonna use and what's important
to buy and you know spending things only
on sale items are only on items that
I've specifically saved up for for a
while you know not just splurging every
time I leave my house so let's get
started so have you get money whether it
be chores a job etc I'm going to show
you how I save money with what I do and
then hopefully you can apply it to your
situation so I get money from YouTube I
get money from my job gap I get money
from my job break up what I think has
helped me the most is opening up a
savings account I have a debit card and
I have a checking account but i also
have a savings account and i just opened
that up like about maybe 2-3 months ago
and before I wouldn't put my paycheck it
I would either get direct deposit it
would be right in my checking account
which was easy access you know just let
my debit card and I got the money or I
would get a paycheck and I would you
know once again deposit it into my
checking account therefore have money to
spend and the main problem that I was
finding was I was spending it on such
useless things I was spending on money
and that was I was depending on money i
would spend it on makeup that was way
too expensive and i didn't need it or
clothes that would literally give away
led to my friends or goodwill the next
day not literally but literally like the
next day and so it was like clothes that
i liked for a day and then I wasn't
really into them or it was just make up
that wasn't working for me and I just
kept buying more and more and more and
more defend the right shade and all this
crap and it was just totally i don't
know i would say i used to be a really
bad spender but i got my job at breadco
it was direct deposit which i got it in
december him dingy december of last year
and once again and be deposited right
into my checking account through direct
deposit and i would just you know spend
it i would try to save but you know when
you had the money right there at the
easiest possible access I mean it's time
it's not as tangible as actual money in
your hand
but it's just a card it's a plastic
cards to see music thing is having money
except it's just all in that little car
that you can slide and put a pin in you
know so anyway and we get the money and
then i would spend it i would get the
next paycheck every two weeks spin it
spin it spin it spin it and I wasn't
working to have many hours to be able to
afford how much I was lending you know I
wasn't liking dead or anything but I
would end up with like 50 cents or you
know lower on my debit card each
paycheck and I wasn't saving at all
which was started to really bug me and
really bother me because I was knew I
was going to college in you know one or
two years or however long ago that was
um i guess it was a year and i didn't
have any money saved up how was I going
to afford makeup or food or or you know
gas or anything that I would need during
college you know how where would I get
that money from my parents when it keep
lending me money and that's I wouldn't
want to ask anyway so I decided once I
got my job at gap and I started working
at breadco again blah blah that whole
story um that I was going to open a
savings account and I wish I'd opened it
sooner but I have been saving since
about I guess it's been longer than she
wants been since like August I guess no
September September's when I opened I
would get my paycheck and let's say this
isn't what I got but let's say it was
400 i would put like two or 250 in my
savings account and then I would keep
200 or 150 for myself and I could
splurge on whatever i want it i could
buy whatever I want to kiss that was my
money for now that's my money that I can
use to save now but I put a huge good
chunk in my savings account that i could
not touch and I like do this like lock
thing on it I'm not like a tangible lock
but like it was just like a lock through
a computer bank system that wouldn't
allow me to get to it I mean I could
withdraw it but it went like if I ran
out of money on my debit card it
wouldn't just like take for my savings
account because that's what they're
saying and I was set it up they were
like do you if you run out of money on
your debit card do you want to just
automatically withdrawal from your
savings account and i was like no
because then i'll be like well it's only
one drink or it's only one CD or
something one mascara or clothing in
them and then i would just keep spending
and all my savings money won't be gone
so i do have a lock on it so i can
withdraw like three times a month i
think it is but i can't just like you
know take money out whenever and it's
easy access because it's really not so
long process i have to go through to get
the money out of my savings account not
my checking my savings account and it's
exactly how I wanted it and I've been
doing good so far I'm so thankful I keep
putting in a little more each month
because I realize
I don't need to spend that much right
now you know I may go out to dinner a
few ties my friends a month or you know
by a makeup product that if I ran out of
foundation or mascara or I cute clothing
at them that I can't live without but
honestly it's like unless it's a
necessity I don't need to spend you know
that money so I put it onto my savings
and I just keep putting more and more my
paychecks that I get into my savings
because I realized that I have
everything I need I'm super blessed and
I don't need to send that all like right
now so my tip for you is to definitely
put some of the money of your paycheck
or allowance into your savings account
and set one up if and get your parents
help and get them to know about how you
want to save money and they'll like take
you seriously and if you know represent
yourself well and they'll be like wow
she's really you know defecating into
this and we're gonna set one up for her
so she can start saving money for
college or for a car or an apartment
which is really older or whatever you're
saving up for you know how whatever your
age might be at this point in time and
so that's the biggest thing that helped
me I believe because even though your
mind might be like I'm gonna save money
I'm gonna save me I'm gonna say this
paycheck you'll see setting a store and
automatically by it a magazine you know
seems cheap seems a little I mean it's
just magazine but there goes four to six
dollars you know and then they just keep
adding up adding up and adding up my
main thing was like food like I know
food that's sad life but I would just go
to dinner all the time or just just hit
lions choice or just paint express all
the time and it's like okay the money's
going down it's decreasing pretty
rapidly so I needed to calm down and put
some of it into savings and I just love
having a savings account and now when I
go to college I won't be afraid that I
won't have money because I'm so much
saved up that'll feel confident about
going so once I don't know how I got
track in back into my life but like I
was saying get your lounge get your
paycheck or whatever you know how old
you are whatever form of money you get
and definitely put some in your savings
account no matter if it's five dollars a
dollar a hundred dollars five billion
dollars however much you get or make
then just put some and gradually
increase if you want or you don't have
to you can just keep it five dollars or
one hundred dollars of ten dollars or a
thousand dollars you know however much
you may just choose a set amount and you
can like let it fluctuate a little each
month whether you need more to send now
this month or you need lesson you don't
need to buy anything so you can put more
to savings I don't know if this is
making sense but seriously savings
accounts are they seem really unfun they
seem really uncool
you don't get that money now but just
think about it it like me I'm gonna have
that money in about five six months and
no I'm not gonna blow it all then I'll
take out maybe 100 or 200 you know every
two to four weeks now do me good and
I'll have money to like feel confident
about and I won't feel nervous about not
being able to pay you know reg if I'm
luminant apartment if you know I'm
living in dorms what if I go to dinner
with a friend and I can't afford that
pizza or might have the check you know
no I'll have money to feel confident and
safe bet and I keep in confident and I
don't mean like strike your stuff I mean
confident like you don't have to worry
or feel unsafe or unprotected by not
having cash or money with you at all
times definitely definitely definitely
save your money because when the time
comes and you need that money it'll feel
like I do most amazing thing like when
you find twenty dollars and like your
wallet in like your closet that you
haven't opened in like 20 years and
you're just like Oh estate it's the best
day and back that's kind of the feeling
cuz you go be at college or you'll be
out and about in the real world and
gonna be like yes boo yeah I have like
billions and all are saved up you're
probably not billions but you know what
I mean also how do you buy things more
carefully um a lot of you probably might
not have this problem but for the
shopaholics out there like more we often
find ourselves lurching on unnecessary
things like just because I make a
product may have the name Mac or urban
decay on it doesn't mean that you need
to bike there are a lot of great dupes
or you know things you can easily go to
the drugstore if you felt about
something forever and you've actually
saved money up just for that item then
you can go ahead and buy that I'm not
saying that you can't ever buy things
that aren't on sale or you need to put
all your money into savings but putting
a little money on each month or each
week into your savings will definitely
help and benefit you and also by not
splurging on all the big items that may
be you know beautiful and amazing at
that moment it'll help you in the long
run and you'll find that you have extra
money because I know a lot of things
that I did splurge on tons things I wish
I could take back I wish I didn't have
them now because like they're really
cool for a month or two but then you're
like I'm not gonna use this again I'm
not gonna wear this again I'm not gonna
you know whatever obviously I'm not
saying no don't ever buy things that are
expensive but be careful and don't
sledge all the time because your money
will be out the window if you just could
be like department stores and buy
everything and try to go to the
clearance racks not embarrassing to go
to a clearance rack or a sale rack and
that's not embarrassing to go to
Goodwill or like a local like teenage
kind of thrift shop store that's really
cool and that was became really trendy
this year and really cool cuz people
could
you know get things and then like make
them their own or ombre them or cut them
up or whatever you know and and tie dye
them and that's really cool too so just
because things may be pre-owned pre-used
or on the clearance rack because they
weren't selling as well or just
clearance because they're like out of
season that doesn't mean that you can't
buy them because that's why I get most
of my clothes I'm not saying I get all
my clothes from goodwill but you know I
get a lot of my clothes from sale racks
and from clearance racks and stores from
21 go to the clearance rack Victoria's
Secret good the clearance rack because
the prices on there are like a billion
times cheaper than clothes that are new
and at the front of the store so that
was my video I hope it kind of helped
you I really like talking about this
topic cuz I used to be one that would
not save my money and splurge on
everything and now I do save and I do
feel that I have a pretty good grasp on
how to save my money and how to spend it
wisely so thank you for watching
subscribe to my channel and maybe
there'll be more advice for Madison
