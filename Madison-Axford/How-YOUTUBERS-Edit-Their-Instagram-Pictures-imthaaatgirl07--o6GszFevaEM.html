what apps youtubers use like myself hey
I'm stirred am doing a quick video and
it's how i edit my Instagram pictures I
know I usually do this with my like
what's on my iPhone I do plus how I have
Instagram pictures but i just showed the
apps and I don't share really what they
do or how I use them or what I do when I
got it you don't want to edit my
pictures and I say edit but I don't like
edit like why in my teeth or made myself
Chan you know when I say edit I mean
like add white space around the picture
or add lights and stuff like that I'm
not like heavily photoshopping or
editing my pictures at all I'm just kind
of editing the format in the way that
it's gonna be on the Instagram so anyway
I thought I'd show you what kind of apps
I use this is pretty much the apps at
all youtubers use so you came to the
right spot because if you're wondering
like what the farts do people use when
they add lights when they add white
space around their pictures and they
make collages I'm your go-to girl to
tell you you know what apps youtubers
use like myself when we put pictures on
instagram twitter tumblr Flickr or
whatever we're using so that further ado
let's get started so i have an iphone
right here so i phone 5 if you hadn't
seemed at what's in my iphone 5 video
I'll link it in the down bar but i'm
going to show you um what how i edit my
pictures like i said because i'm an
Instagram and Twitter junkie so um so
we'll definitely be helpful because I do
add tons of white space around my
pictures and I I don't really add lights
but I have apps if I whatever want to
add lights like I have apps to do that
and that's what youtubers have in use
and I haven't you even I don't use them
anyway I'm gonna zoom you in and we'll
get started okay so um all my photo
editing apps um here's a camera you know
the app they can't round besides the
camera app I don't have any photography
or editing camera apps on the front page
I have them all on my second page and I
have a appt little file that says
photography so I know where to go when I
want you edit pictures and put on
Instagram want to just you know take a
picture and I want to put it on the
square I go to so I have five apps as
you can see here that I love I'm i love
deleting apps it sounds weird but I love
deleting if I don't use them they're
gone but I do use these except for I
don't really use these light ones but I
kept some for the purpose of this video
I'm
show you what youtubers use like I said
so first of all let's go to my Instagram
if you've seen where's Miriam there it
is um if you have follow my instagram or
twitter and you've seen pictures that I
posted and I love having white space
around it as you can see here there's
pretty much a white frame around all of
my pictures that I posed the older ones
don't have it but my more recent ones do
if you have like a really long vertical
picture and it's not going to fit on
Instagram and app that I don't have it i
would suggest to use is wit a gram or
white or gray i'm in this way you can
fit a huge vertical picture on Instagram
because usually instagram the crop the
way across pictures it cuts it off but
if you want to include the whole picture
gate what a gram it puts two white
stripes on either side of it and you
know you're good to go when you can put
the whole picture on there and and white
space so that's why i used to use but
now i use different app and it works you
know the same this is also intagram
except i used it horizontally because my
picture was horizontally long so it just
does white strips above and below the
picture rather than on each side of it
and then as you can see here i
transitioned from having full like
square pictures to ones with white space
on the sides of them here's white on the
side of it okay so i just think it looks
artsy cute and looks like you put a lot
of time into centering your photo and
making it have white space around it
here i have multiple pictures but i had
to do that with a different app and so
on and so on i love having white stuff
around my pictures i just think it looks
so much more artsy and cute you're
probably wondering how do i put one
picture um and get white space around it
however much white space you want to use
wherever you want it to be you can put
the picture wherever you want on this
app and then it'll put white space all
around it so the app that I use for that
is called square ready let's say I
wanted to put this picture I'm be my
sister on and I wanted to have white
space erotic so it was just boring um so
you just kind of move it around wherever
you want it to go and then see how
there's white space around this now so
yeah that's where red tape look is one
that a lot of blood a lot of
instagramers youtubers famous youtubers
views to put one or more because square
root of you can only put one picture in
it and put white space around it you can
put one or more pictures on paper look
so this is how I make collages yet the
collages with white space otherwise i'll
just use on like a photo grid one if i
want to do a collage so you get to tape
look and yet nue anyway say
great now let's just pick a random
picture um say I want to put this
picture of me and this picture made my
sister okay really random I wouldn't do
this but then you just kind of move
around put them where we wanted to go
you can do one picture where you can do
two or three or however many i think it
goes up to five and you can also like
turn them swivel you can turn them any
way you want and you can make your
collage and it has white space around it
and I love that so Pape look if you want
to add lights like so many youtubers do
with their food products they bought
whatever um after light or Lumia um they
both cost I think ninety-nine cents
except Lumia I think might be cheaper
now but I bought it when I was 199
anyway lumia I'm not a huge fan of
either of these light things but I mean
I don't know I don't know why you would
want to use lights but you know if you
want to you can hear inspection
Mackenzie okay so we're just going to
choose this picture and then they have
all these different designs that you can
use and put on your picture so you got
skulls you got flashing lights you got
designs you get stars you get hearts you
got whatever dots circles okay so say I
just want to use these hearts and their
kind of stupid but oh so cool um so
again I don't use it this much but these
this is um an app that a lot of
youtubers use to add little designs and
stuff like that so this is all they have
to offer though they don't have any
filters like after light does but as you
can see there's just cute little light
designs that you might want to use
anyway moving on to after light which
everyone uses again I was just gonna
pick a random picture okay I so cute um
me Mike Enzi got a photo shoot that's
why I have all these random pictures but
they have all these things down here
that you can use you can use different
filters you can crop it here use
different shapes like you can cut this
into a heart or a circle or a letter
whatever you want to do and they have
different brightnesses and and stuff
like that and you can add lights and
designs just like new me and just like
other light ups as well and this is
where people get tons of the light
designs and like filters and the little
query Sparkle lights that you see on
people's pictures is mostly from after
light and if you want more I think you
just cost like the more designs and
stuff that you want you know it does go
up in price and lastly if you want to
make a collage my favorite one to do so
is pick stitch and so this is just
simple self-explanatory and you pick an
outline there's tons of omagh tons tons
of outlines and then you just fill in
however many pictures you want again
it's free until you want really big
elaborate outlines that you do have to
buy anyway I hope you enjoyed this video
I know I went kind of fast but that is
the apps that youtubers use or even if
they don't use those exact ones you can
achieve the same kind of photo books and
you know ability to post photos like
them by using those apps so I hope you
enjoyed this video if you're not already
