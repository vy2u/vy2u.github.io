makeup tutorial so we always start with
eyes painterly paint-pot

movie that you like to use ie JD just do
you like pink and then like sometimes I
think like a gray or light darker on
high okay so today we're gonna do purple
right here as a transition then I'm
going to take this purple shade right
here
from maybe a pic as well and a matte
flat shader brush and that prepper crime
and spray the brush to get it wet so
that it picks up the containment more
it's more compelling right here and I'm
going to take the two shades I don't
compare these two up purples and then
blend them together with mega meat brush

roommates
Mozilla Kat Von D tattoo liner and we're
gonna do wings yes that is mess with
staple

do here we go how there any crazy
roommate stars you totally do it just
like come into my room because like we
had a fever roommates but we had two
separate rooms and so she would come in
and we were just literally listen to
music and dance around and she would be
in her heels

minutes every day every day
