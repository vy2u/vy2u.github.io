weird to Instagram go same here
um I I have no idea what happened um I
first we just say instagrams my favorite
form of social media besides YouTube you
know which is like a job between Twitter
Tumblr snapchat Facebook all those
things like Instagram has always been my
thing like I love it doesn't matter how
many likes you get doesn't matter how
many follow we have it's just the fun of
seeing people's pictures and and people
themes or filters like all this stuff I
just I just love it I think it's very
creative
social networking platform site and and
I love it every when I get up in the
morning it's the first thing to check
and I got up this morning
I've separate 31st to check it and first
I had like text being like medicine what
do why'd you delete your Instagram I was
like valve so I went on Instagram and I
had locked me out so I try to log in
with my normal username my password and
it was like it was like you let me
actually my split up so have the exact
words like you have violated some
guidelines and your accounts been
deleted disabled this is gone yeah your
accounts been disabled for violating our
Terms so I have been on my phone and
computer all day trying to get back on
trying to look on trying to you know go
to stupid-ass Instagram support those
and do okay if you're gonna have a
support team make sure they're on board
and on deck for whatever there's problem
Instagram ACCA's Instagram the app
actually sucks it sucks it crashes all
the time like there's no wonder has
three star to star rating on an iTunes
Store app store because it doesn't work
well because they delete so many
accounts they think this is so amazing
by deleting all these accounts and all
this and cleaning out spam accounts
or robots but really you're deleting
real people's stuff and I can get that
account back right now there's nothing I
can do that's in my power I can't give
those pictures I don't have the picture
saving my phone sound have memories have
to delete them I don't have my pictures
I don't know who I was following it
doesn't matter about followers that's if
you and if you're gonna come on here be
like let's Instagram then like literally
even get off my video I'm done with you
like you don't need to come on your bag
it's just a social networking site
that's not what the deal is when you
have a job as social media it's annoying
when a huge chunk in your favorite piece
of your social media puzzle which is
YouTube Twitter Instagram template
whatever is missing its aromas are gone
I have no Instagram platform I have
nothing I don't have the pictures and I
don't know who's following I know a few
people but I'm like who was I like I I'm
not ever gonna be able to find all those
cans and not all of you are gonna come
and follow my new account but I had to
create new Instagram account and that's
another thing I created a new Instagram
account and I can't even log onto it on
my phone or my iPad it's like sorry you
had a previous count on this device that
was disabled and I'm like I'm sorry what
so now I've tried to I've tried to
delete the app multiple times every star
my phone my ID should I have to restore
both of those things which deletes all
my content on my contacts my messages my
photos my music my apps my movies my
everything has to be deleted off both my
devices my I've had my iPhone in order
to for me to just try and see if I can
log into a stupid-ass Instagram account
again um I did nothing that I'm aware to
go against instagrams stupid ass
guidelines
I see people threatening me all the time
I see people calling me like stupid ass
bitch all this all the time and I
see like people bullying each other and
starting each other and their accounts
are still up for some reason but me who
just goes day-to-day posting pictures of
my life for you guys to see and to
connect with you on one of the many
social media platforms my account gets
deleted my account gets disabled because
I violated guidelines I have absolutely
no idea what I did I don't post I don't
use drugs or alcohol but even if I did I
wouldn't post pictures of that and I
don't have made pictures that on my
account I don't like I'm it watch my
cussing in like my language that I use
on my how I I don't know what I could
have done wrong like I looked at their
guidelines and it's like if you are
gambling like know if you're selling
things and like exchanging real money if
you post recreational or illegal drug
use if you like all this stuff like I
haven't done anything obviously but
first of all its disgusting and second
of all you have it and I'm like where
did my account
like I I know it's just an Instagram
account and you can create another one
but it's so freakin annoying when this
is my job this is my job to have a
social media thing and when part of its
missing its kind of annoying and
I don't really know where to start now I
woke up and I was like I'm so tired let
me just check out like how people are
doing on Instagram like what people want
posted while I was still asleep and I
chopped it out of bed when I saw that I
was invisible and I no longer existed
like it says Mad Max producer does not
exist so if you saw me on like you're in
for a bore whatever no I do not follow
you
for some reason Instagram took my count
off um I create a new account
please follow me um because I will be
posting from there until this is
resolved if my old account can come back
or this will just have to move my new
account it's Madison Taylor Axford
because it's only one that's me no one
else can be me because I'm the only me
it's my first memo and last name so I'm
Madison Taylor expert please look it up
it's one word no underscores no dots no
space no anything on Instagram if homie
because this is like sad like Instagram
was everything I loved Instagram and and
I hate people who are like well you're
too invested in like involvement social
media that's it what it is nowadays okay
this isn't the 1960s it's not even that
you know 1990s this is 2000 and almost
16 tomorrow so you know social media is
everything people have jobs on social
media people have lives created and it
started from social media and social
media is really the root of everything
you can't really survive nowadays
technologically at least which this is a
technological era without social media
like if you don't social media that's
not a good thing anymore that's weird
like you need social media to really
succeed in especially in my field of
study and my current career so I'm
really pissed off it's annoying and I
don't know what I did an Instagram
support system is absolutely awful
I've emails them over 20 times or no
sense in like support things through
their website I've emailed them and this
is oh their email inbox is full like
sorry we can't get your email because
like they sent it back to me err Damon
whatever it is to my yahoo email because
Instagram support at Instagram to calm
email is full well then oh my god
Instagram you have enough money I think
to have someone on deck on their support
system like I don't
every other website really has a
supported a chat system whether that's
through a computer or an actual human
being on the other side of the computer
if you don't have swore curb that's
there for people 24/7 who I mean
millions I think 400 million people just
register for intern Instagram accounts
one of the biggest social media
followings of any social media platform
you think you'd have a support person
because of all the errors that are on
your website your social media site your
app you think you'd have someone there
to help people with the many problems
that your app does cause oh my god so
yeah I don't know everything is gone
and the only thing I'm really that paced
about is that first of all is that I
wasn't given warning I was just erased
off the like the website the app like I
didn't exist anymore like I was a man a
person like if I did something whether
or not it was true in a valid reason to
leave my account which I cannot think of
anything I ever did to deserve my
account to be disabled and deleted
forever to do with us into the abyss of
cyberspace but if I did something at
least tell me we're going to do save it
because this recent or something so I'm
not sitting here looking like deer in
headlights the whole day because I'm
confused on what happened to my online
profile like um that's what beats me up
and second thing is that I wasn't even
warning and I couldn't get the pictures
off there how did I know I would wake up
tomorrow and everything would be deleted
like my luck mine my YouTube we delete
tomorrow like I should even say that
nothing would but who freaking knows at
this point and I can't get the pictures
yeah I have some recent pictures but
pictures from way back when when I was
at Mozilla before mizzu when I was in
high school at Christmas like all this
stuff prior to this happening I didn't
have those pictures really saved most of
them but not all of them and that's it
pisses me off that videos I'm wearing
saved it and all the and like mad
to freakin restore my devices to try to
just try to try to log back into my new
Instagram account because you know
because I had the account logged into my
devices before and I was disabled and
now it's acting like I'm some like bully
person who can't have any account even
if it's never get other than it was
happening okay so follow me on my new
account you know I love you guys and I'm
sorry they have to see it's red but I'm
really pissed off right now
I made imagine if everything you had me
online on your social media just left it
was deleted and you were giving no
warning and you were given no reason no
warning no reason
Nokes when
nation and time sitting here with a
thousand and one questions and wondering
if someone did this if I was hacked if
Instagram just was deleting what they
thought were robot accounts if I
actually did something like I and I hate
I hate feeling like this so I'm sorry
Madison Taylor expert is my new account
M ad is Ont ayl o ra X I've already
follow me
um and I will be posting on there until
this is resolved and that just may have
to be my new account I want a man Baxter
but I can't use that account anymore
Nate that name that username because
it's it's been disabled
so yeah Instagram you suck so follow me
on my new Instagram account telling us
my doing screams cuz everyone in their
mother does Instagram and I want you
guys to be able to follow me in and see
a glimpse in my real life because I feel
like I'm so much more real unlike
Twitter in in in snapchat and Instagram
and not that I'm I'm not fake on YouTube
but you only see a little bit of me like
how did this my friend makeup I spy and
I'm there I get to show you what I do
day to day with my friends in my family
with with myself like with just and then
it's gone so yeah the channel reason I'm
getting a new account otherwise I
wouldn't be doing it but it's one of the
top leading like a social networking
sites so I feel like I need to do it to
succeed in this field but it's a grand
apparently once to with me and elite
Alma
so master X were forming a new one and I
will be very happy that she did so I
love you all all of you guys and I hope
it's a great resource together
because this is not I'm nothing I'm eyes
how to do is I've made a lot of people
and it pisses us off tremendously no
warning no reason love you guys so much

pissed off and I will be ranting
