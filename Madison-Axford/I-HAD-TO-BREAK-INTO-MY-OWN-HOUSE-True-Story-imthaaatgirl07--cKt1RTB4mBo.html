story of when I had to break into my
house it's kind of funny story so it
literally happened a month ago not even
like less than a month ago um I was
coming home from college and I was
coming home and my family was currently
out of town in New York City and I was
house-sitting our house obviously is
taken care of our fish named RuPaul no
joke his name's RuPaul and our dog
Dumervil and so in liking the papers
getting the mail why don't we plan
something yeah I think I was like half
sitting on my own house because my mom
dad sister were gone and I couldn't go
cuz it's the week of in like middle of
and like the week before like all it was
the finals week and I was coming home to
you know not only study but house it and
that's why I couldn't go on a vacation
to New York because I had to have finals
and be home to study and concentrate and
focus and then be the one to watch her
house anyway that was way too but
traveling like I think you understood
was trying to say right now until I got
home and I don't know what happened but
so we have a front door and like two
back doors and then like a door through
our garage I don't know what happened so
since day but I guess when I had left
that morning somehow hit the lock or
something happened with food with us in
the garage lock because I open I gosh
and I go up to the door that's an air
crash that enters into our house and it
was locked okay so I was like no no no
this isn't happening like I didn't freak
out because like this is a nap this is
what this isn't happening I can't be
locked out of my house and so the garage
door door saw the front doors obviously
liked you back doors locked and I'm like
oh my god jars call a locksmith why do i
do like I don't know what should you I
don't have a house key don't we only
have one house key it's on my mom set of
keys which is inside the house and so
I'm like oh my god I have to break a
window or come to a window it was 930 at
night keep in mind or 945 is really late
dark outside freezing cold I didn't have
a jack cake so I was like I'm just gonna
walk around my house and I didn't bring
it from my college because I don't need
going to a car and into my house I don't
need to bring my jacket home so it was
like 30 degrees out I was freezing I
couldn't get in the house I'm not gonna
vote locksmith first of all because I
well I didn't call my parents yet
because I didn't want me mad but and I
didn't want their luck sent to change
the locks warehouse in charge of so much
my sounds like oh my god I'm have to
break the windows like I don't know how
to get into this difference term it's a
good house so I go to the back of our
house which is like if you're walking on
down all these rocks and then you to get
in this like sketchy gate that doesn't
even open cross our pool go about these
other stairs I go through 900 plants
it's like a freaking safari force don't
go in a backyard trying to get to up my
deck um to the back porch short so I get
to that door it's um so locked and I'm
just like okay I remember two days ago I
opened a window to get fresh air and so
I was like I don't think I locked that
window like I think I closed it that I
didn't lock it so please God let that
window be unlocked and let me be able to
get in my house and so I looked in in
the one on the right was lost collision
of the one the one I left was unlocked
and I was like oh my god I'm gonna have
to break into this window and so I
didn't ever thought like I'm gonna throw
a rock at a shout out the glass nothing
thought it was like let's see if I can
get it up but there was a scream on the
outside the window so I had to pull the
screen as hard as i could with a not a
lot of force what was so forced to kind
of pull it back and I didn't think I was
breaking it I anything out do anything
wrong later in my mom told me I broke
the screen but that's later later it's
story anyway so I open the screen I'm
pulling at it not like with absurd
forswear oh my gosh I probably almost
broke it no I thought I was being gentle
with it and I finally got it popped out
of the window um which I did it wrong it
I messed it up but I thought oh my God
look I could get in this house and
didn't break the screen the window
whatever anything and so I'm lifting off
the window I'm getting like all this
ratchet-ass like old Christy pain on my
hands and I'm like what is the white so
I finally managed to lift up the window
which is really hard because I dig my
fingers my little nubs which really hurt
underneath the window to get it up
because inside this like little handle
you live just like I window open but on
the outside they don't have that for
people like this who so that they won't
break into your house and somehow I like
jammed my finger and stuff under it I am
I
phone flashlights egg of a mile selling
huh I trying to shine down on what I'm
doing spish back like there's not even
moonlight okay the morning the clouds
are covering the mode everything's not
working out for me and I finally lift a
window as far as i could go which is
like this much it wouldn't open anymore
thin like this much and I'm like oh my
girl I was like no this is the only way
I'm gonna get it I hear my dog barking
like there's no screen on the inside of
my window so it the only thing the same
between me and getting this house is my
big ass body trying to squeeze this
little slit of a window that pot was
popped up so I'm just like deep breaths
medicine you'll be fine you ready got
your tetanus shot so if anything is
scratched or cut or stabbed into you
won't be fine and so here I go trying to
get this little sled meanwhile the
screen is like falling down like the
screen is totally off the window is
popped out is bent beyond repair words
with my mom and I managed to squeeze and
slide into our house through this little
literally this wide of a window opening
my life is a very aventuras I choose to
not do things that would put me in
situations ever like this so it's very
scary that I do that so yeah I made it
in I didn't scratch anything I was fine
like I didn't get hurt or bruised right
thing I like roll into the floor almost
I fall into the floor I pull my backpack
in and I have my phone and stuff and I'm
just like they'll just happened right
and so I let my dog out to pee you're
opening I'm sure like recoup like I get
out you know uncrustables Island curse
was so I got an uncrustable to defrost
I'm like my dinner and I'm sure to be
like what what what I am most
adventurous person I don't know and so
after everything was fine and i had
thought I popped the screen back on
correctly I didn't I call my mom and she
was kind of like medicine what the heck
is happening and I still consisted on a
high that door locked but um yeah I we
had to get a new screen because I've
kind of broke the other one but how was
I supposed to get it I couldn't get in
the freaking house I didn't have a key
so yo and where he's maiden we're good
now but that is a story of how I broke
into my house it's pretty interesting

crazy and adventurous for me in my life
