and okay I'm doing the I Heart Paula tag
which I'm super-excited for except for
the fact that it as some questions about
like Halloween and what you dressed up
for and stuff like that in a looms over
because it's November 16 so if you're
like I shoulda Halloween is over I'm
sorry but I really want to do this tag
since I just got a youtube account and
everyone does this is the I heartfelt
tag so I was like yeah I'm just gonna do
it and whatever I mean booster cushions
are cool so I have my computer here as
you can tell I'm really pushes off so if
there's like a glare on my face you know
where thats from and you know I'm
looking down okay let's get started with
this supercut I have fault okay so
question number one what is your
favorite Falls lip product I had to go
with something that i've been using
non-stop recently that um is a like a
lip moisturizer but still adds color and
attend to your lips which is this baby
lips and it is in the plum shade so this
is what it looks slick it's super
moisturizing baby lips is one of the
best like chapsticks if your lips are
really chapped or dry and it also makes
you look like that plummet in so I
really like this it's very subtle it's
good my favorite fall lip product
question number two favorite fall nail
pay had to go with something that just
recently had my nails but I check it off
please excuse these ugly little nubs I
consider my nails OPI Siberian nights
it's this dark purple it's kind of like
the plum color but it's darker I got
this right 50 at Ulta and it's just a
really pretty color question number
three favorite Starbucks bulging out i'm
not a huge starbucks coffee fan like
when I go there I don't get any coffee I
just I'm not a big fan of it being only
a teenager like like I have enough
energy where I don't need to be
constantly drinking coffee every morning
so when I go and I do get their hot
chocolates I really love them so I
really recommend getting their hot
chocolates if you have not tried them as
like an alternative to coffee hmm
question number four favorite Falk and
I'm not trying to be like every other
Beauty group but Yankee organic ins bath
and Bodyworks leaves this is like a new
edition of it it's kind of old like
woodsy or flowery I don't really know it
just looks like fall and this smells
exactly how I picture of all over a year
like how I like picture leaves
begins in holidays and stuff and you
just smell this and it doesn't smell
like outdoors but it just is a great
smoke I suppose like pumpkins and spice
that's what smells like so I really
recommend you going and smelling
enjoying this it's a great smell all
right question number five favorite
scarf for full or accepted it's a jacket
and it's the one I'm wearing so this is
just a black jacket I got 425 dollars
from charlotte russe i'm wearing this
little skull bando under it but this is
what it looks like it has a little
zipper snap compartment um scholar and
it's just really edgy really hardcore
has little pockets and this is so not
what I'm used to wearing but I saw this
and I just kind of picked it up with a
gift card i had and i really like it
i've been wearing them a lot as a jacket
and shirt and all that stuff for fall
and i think it goes really good has like
hardware on it it's just super cute for
fall people come up to me like was not
like you and i'm like right now but i
like this new style so yeah go for the
jagger question number 6 on in house
haunted hayride or haunted corn maze
helming has passed i don't know if
they're still kind of open i'm not a big
scary sprite person scare fright I don't
know I just don't like any of those I've
never really been to one um so I guess
it's kind of hard for me to judge
whether and I like that but I don't like
scary movies that much so considering
that things to jump out at you and like
scare you not really my forte so I'm
gonna have to go with none but I like
watching movies and question 7 favorite
Halloween mood I'm gonna have to go with

really good movie in everyone loves when
