that I'm extremely pissed that I have to
do I am like in the past like few years
of my life
I have never been this pissed off like
I'm so mad right now I can't even like
contain it so I'm doing a video to warn
you about this company that will scam
you for all your money
it's called Bheema luxe and it sucks
so um Wow okay this is a skincare
company which I wouldn't even gets into
them a company I have access to them a
skin care scammer um I'm disgusted to
touch this product I am so appalled by
this company vive looks right here so
you know to never buy anything from them
I don't even want to make this video in
the only reason I'm doing it is to warn
you because I don't want this to happen
to anyone else here's this disgusting
tiny little bottle thing of um face
cream it smells first of all like puke
on a bathroom floor in a bar sides that
this product is supposed to do you know
reduce wrinkles get rid of all your
wrinkles you don't need Botox you don't
need any this all the stars use it yeah
all the stars use it my ass so my mom
like she like glow sees face cream
things I don't think she needs them but
she like is obsessed with a trying to
lose me a wrinkle anti-wrinkle formulas
and stuff which is fine right and so I
was like okay pick one at home and
because I want to get you something like
just like I don't know I just want to go
sanctum la York she does so much for me
and I was like I'll just get you saying
little and she was like oh no no no and
I was like mom's picking up you got a
face cream you always like those she was
like okay and trends really cheap one or
so we thought so said only 4.95 for this
viva luxe face cream and we're like
great okay oh my god yeah we'll get that
one I was like okay I'll get that one
free month so I put a micro K I shoulda
known that this was a scam website by
this picture like it just looks like
someone would scam you the company is
located in the United States
okay so um it's literally four to five
four nine five four five forty five no
like um return policies no like it had
no directions or anything like no um
like policies like nothing was just
twenty five so I should have known there
with
red flags that I should not have bought
in this but I went ahead with it anyway
on my mom line and she heard a lot about
it was all over Facebook and all over
the internet so you know you you trust
things off the internet right
but apparently me and my mom should not
have and so I put my credit card number
in whatever and my address and
everything and I get sent this or for my
mom and it was like about a month ago I
was at this and so on the charge was 185
on my credit card statement cuz I
checked my online bank accounts all the
time because I don't want to get it
screwed over like I did by this company
and so um I repeatedly check in each
time I spend something anywhere
restaurant store whatever you know
online or in person I'm always checking
it like I took it pretty much every day
so recently I got my rent being thanks
payment it said people looks ninety
dollar charge
that's recurring each month I'm sorry
nine eight cents no than enough ninety
eight dollars each month plus at four
ninety five which apparently stood for
shipping yet said that nowhere on the
website so I had not looked at my bank
statement I would have been charged
ninety eight dollars every month from
here on out until I realized what was
happening first of all this stuff
doesn't work it sucks
they put pictures of celebrities who
have had Botox on the website they're
like these people use it like Anne
Hathaway and Kate Hudson no that's and
this is awful first of all just smells
disgusting like let if we talk about is
this product and not the scammers that
run this place for a second this product
doesn't work it smells disgusting it's
greasy you're not by the vol luxe oh um
Wow I have never been scammed before um
like I I know people haven't I've had
like family members getting scammed
before and people take their credit card
numbers but I never have because I feel
like I'm still young and new to this
business um in like that there are crazy
main people out there but how dared this
company not put any policies on there if
this was going to be a recurring charge
of 98 dollars every month you have to
warn the customers or you could get sued
and we are taking this up like with a
legal person because this is absolutely
ridiculous should not have happened and
so you know we call it I call it the
customer sir
and first of all because of our service
rating one out of ten would not even
just over one they were the most rude
inconsiderate people they didn't have a
crap about me and they literally
actually do weren't hearing what I was
saying like I was like uh this was
nowhere on the website said 495 why the
hell am I being charged $98 I want a
refund you can have this shitty product
back means that I don't want it I've
said back to you and pay the shipping
charge for that to get it out of my
freakin life and give me my 98 dollars
back there's $100 and for someone who
doesn't have a steady income besides
YouTube um no identity bills right now
but I should not have to be taken I
should not have many dollars taken out
of my pocket that's not whether I have
to pay bills or not that should not have
to anyone and that is not okay when it's
not listed anywhere on the website I
look everyone the website I cannot find
anything and when I was on the phone
they didn't they weren't even like oh
well it's on there like they probably
knew it was it like they're all idiots
and they didn't say anything they were
just like uh-huh uh-huh I'm like I want
to talk to manager they're like we don't
have a manager
what kind of company does not have a
manager that you go talk to who is
running your sketchiest parents basement
is disgusting and I'm like mom who never
put this on your face again okay first
why you pay 98 dollars each month for
eight thirty day trial is one ounce I
suppose last 30 days oh my god
it literally expired already - you've
got to be five 2115 five you came to me
that it says five 2115 okay way back to
the phone call and then I was like I
want my refund he's like well um it you
can't send the product back and get a
refund after 14 days I'm like again
listen absolutely nowhere on the website
did it say enemy 198 dollars or a 14-day
refund
return policy and this company is
absolutely disgusting these slimebags
these people that would do this to get
money from isn't people who I just
wanted my my mom gift and I get over
this bad so no I am so so so pissed off
right now I am so pissed up and I get
pissed off when people do bad things but
this is on a whole other level because
you are messing with me and my family
and my money that I've worked for that's
absolutely not okay I don't know how
these people can go to bed and I feeling
good about themselves when they know
they're scamming thousands people over
each day who fall for this
they say they think they don't have a
manager I'm gonna call them on Tuesday
yet again and give them more hell
because this is absolutely ridiculous
if you different have it said Oh 14 days
and $98 on their website but since it
said that no where I stopped and also
they were like on the phone they're like
well we can give you like a 25% off
discount for the rest of your lifetime
supply I think I would continue to spend
money on this month after month without
pay I mean how sucky this product is and
then I was like um hell no and then
they're like okay we we can give you a
50% off discount for your rest of your
lifetime supply like I would use this or
my mom would use this for the rest of
our life do not buy be Velux it is the
biggest scam and ripoff of your entire
life I don't care if this worked that is
not okay to scam someone over like that
I don't care if every celeb uses this
it's not okay to say I'm someone over
like that even on the best it was like
McAfee safe and like all this stuff like
oh it's secured Norton like this isn't a
virus we're not going to scam you over I
can't help this actually true or if that
was like clipart they just posted on
their thing to trick people yet again
into thinking this was a safe secure
website these people are discussing sign

on a Twitter you know them Instagram
YouTube whatever their website call them

because this is ridiculous and I know
it's only 98 dollars but that's a lot
someone who works their ass off for the
money every day which most people do I
don't know anyone who just get some
money handed to them easily and I for
one do not so the money that I work for
should not be ripped out of my hand
because of some disgusting ask people in
the middle of nowhere making this fake
ass product and ripping off innocent
people this is absolutely disgusting
so yell at them for me don't worry I'm
gonna call them back and we're having
people on our side fighting against
these people because it's absolutely
ridiculous as a matter of 98 dollars are
done eight thousand dollars it's still
my money and it should not have been
taken when there was nothing written or
said about it anywhere on that website
or when I was checking out this product
