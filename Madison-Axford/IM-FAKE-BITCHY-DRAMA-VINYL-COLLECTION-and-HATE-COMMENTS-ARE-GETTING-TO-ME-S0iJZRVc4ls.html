face right so I wanted to start doing
hear me out
these videos where just can't talk
because I feel like for so long my
videos have been well first of all none
present on my channel right I have
enough video in like I'm gonna done
videos but they've been so far and in
between and spar said it's actually
really depressing and I am yeah I love
you too but I used to love it so much
more I feel like and now I feel you just
become like a little bit like oh god
yeah that's right I gotta do a video and
I wanted to be like that like I
shouldn't have to feel like okay hello
umm annoying and it wasn't you guys no
no it was just the whole editing blood
was in a process takes a long time and
people don't realize that unless you
like do YouTube first hand and even if
it's a shooting to second video it still
takes a little bit so that was just kind
of getting to me and and I'm in college
and you know that I go to college for
your institution like the private
college um really fun I love college I
finally am in a place where I really
love education cuz we're still long as
like friends and Jonna and shit and
bullying and stuff and I didn't like it
but now it's like I love it is fun I
love learning I love homework and stuff
like that um and so I'm really focusing
on that and not saying it that's okay
for me to deprive time from YouTube but
that's what has haven't been happening
and so I want to get back to it but what
I want to do is videos like this like I
said hear me out tell me if this is the
stupidest have you ever heard me sitting
here in a freaking facemask looking
ratchet where you forget to Cincinnati
hoodie not giving a single would and you
know just living holding a pillow like
is this weird oh shit
got stuff in the pillow um is this bad
do you guys hate it or is it okay
because I could totally die with this I
love this this feels real and that's
another thing I am the realest bitch you
will ever meet I would give it to you
straight
I'm not going to talk about Hydra back I
will not talk hi and someone back and
another thing about me
is like if I am talking behind your back
or I'm saying something to you good or
something about you but or bad you'll
know it because I'm not wanting to be
secretive even like slimy no you'll know
something's up because like we won't be
totally ok look you'll know sign is
wrong and therefore it will lead you to
believe that I might be saying something
or thinking something and another thing
is I would never talk my dog's back
unless you give me reasonable or
probable cause to do so and I would
never um say anything bad about anyone
or dislike someone or or be mean to
someone unless you give me a reason to
do so aka do something to me like along
those same lines so uh I don't know
where that rant came from but I've
gotten a lot of comments and stuff
recently been like just so fake she's so
fake no no wonder no one follows her
she's so fake I'm like bitch fuck up you
don't know what you were talking about
ok because I'm the realest bitch you
will ever meet I post pictures with
shitting my teeth with I like sneezed
and got like a loony on a window to a
picture of it on snapchat like people
don't do that and kind of gross ratchet
whatever but that's me I'm not trying to
be prim and proper
I need no perfect person I'm here in the
green freakin face and I said on my face
that I'm trying to boot yeah shit but
it's making my skin red as hell I have a
breakout and this is burning my face
this Kate Somerville trying to try it
keepin like a beautycon box and now my
face is four kids stinging and I look
like beetlejuice - this off but again
don't give a fuck because I'm Madison
okay and so that's what I want people to
know about me is people think that I'm
like fake or something and I'm like do
you know it's fake means fake it's
literally like fake lips don't have
those fake boobs don't have those think
lashes wear those because I cut off my
lashes so I have a reason to do so fake
nails only have one freaking on because
I'm one ratchet as hell and don't dye my
hair don't fix Han don't mind my teeth
it's like I don't do the fake ass shit
if you do it awesome for you go getting
a freaking award but people coming out
anything like you're thinking no I'm not
I'll tell it to you straight
I'll tell you right now that I'm not
having fun doing YouTube currently and
I'm changing that because what it's just
kind of feeling like a little bit of
hassle okay let's bring something else
up did a star boy cover last
um why did I do a cover and why are you
sitting on this channel because I like
freaking singing I've sang since I was
maybe seven or eight I was a rich we
need to make this clear okay
I was originally trained as a musical
feature performer that's why my voice
sounds so much I don't know like
dramatic or maybe clear or vibrato is
the term she would use and so pop wasn't
for John rather people are trained it
because pop is full of glottal strokes
and breath unnecessary breathing and
what you don't know with glottal starts
aren't that music you can't comment on
my singing cuz you don't know what that
means okay bitch fight I'm so seeing
these comments as well I mean it's
really gun to me I don't know if I can
do YouTube anymore no because it doesn't
fucking bother me at all
you're gonna be like this is fake what
is happening to mess no this is real
Madison and my friends and family know
that this is me I'm just gonna show you
romancing excite what you guys are
coming closer and be with me oh and see
me from really who I am and not like I'd
like to blend eyeshadow because that's
fake okay if you just come on here and
pretend like your crease is so perfect
no I want to see the real you
it's like Trisha Paytas is my favorite
person ever because she's real she cries
in the floor she laughs on the floor she
dies in the floor like she goes through
her life and it's not it's entertaining
to watch it's not fun it's not funny but
you live with her you like get to know
her life and I wanted to bring you guys
in on this so I knew I told my mom this
I said I'm putting on the cover and
she's like because what happens last 80
covers I did everyone dislikes it
everyone was like okay the world's
ending it's the worst thing in the world
is singing oh my god you're acting like
I'm freaking I don't know tone deaf or
something I know that I'm not tone deaf
but I also know that I'm not the best
singer in the world but why I put up
covers it's cuz I do like singing just
like I like doing makeup in mind the
best at it know what not horrid so I
have every right and freedom to put up a
video of whatever the I want to do that
doesn't go against guidelines on YouTube
so me singing star boy one of my
favorite songs from this past year is
fine I added my own embellishments to it
I made in my own out Frick I just got
snail up Yas look it's like pulling the
skin yeah
is ill I'm chillin right under that nail
do not make in the trash but I'll get it
later okay
yes I'm thick nails those hurt so bad
hey um yeah I don't know where I was but
I told my mom she's like good because I
get so low man I hate coming to my
videos and so I put it up made at my own
was proud of it did I done better
sure could I've done worse yeah so could
everyone but the amount of comments I
got being like this isn't in your vocal
range Oh what are you doing
drink bleach though die how the fuck
dare you tell me to die because I'm
singing a song check your life I'm sorry
but you have some psychological thing
going on that is wrong for you to go on
YouTube for some random girl just having
fun the senior song to tell them to
drink bleach and die okay sit your ass
down and shut the hell up bitch okay
another thing people continuously
telling me first all their promo
pictures I look like they're like 9 like
me you 16 they're like this is not in
your range maybe you could sing but
maybe it's so handsome your range that
wasn't my range I could hit every note
in that song and lower and higher so
don't tell me that you know my range I
know my range because I was
professionally trained for seven or
eight years in vocal performance so
don't tell me that you also didn't know
my range
uh-uh like I said I was training musical
theaters so the voice I'll do some pop
songs like star boy or any other
previous covers I've done it's different
than my original like my true voice
because it was trained early um at a
young age as a musical theater so if I
sound breath you or nasally or whiny or
whatever that's just like the way that I
make pop sounds my voice isn't gonna
sound like the weekend it's not gonna
sound Taylor Swift or Katy Perry ariana
grande cuz I'm Madison my voice again
it's not like me if you don't like it
get the fuck of my channel you don't
need to leave a hey comment if you need
to leave any comment though for some
weird problem that you have that's fine
because like I said you don't affect me
and people are like nobody this is
affecting her no this is me telling you
I believe in my life I'm happy it's how
face masks all I did today was clean my
room and give her a bunch of stuff and I
felt so successful today um so it is not
bothering me that's the problem it's not
it's not bothering me or affecting me
but the problem is that people like that
I'm making
YouTube for everyone such a negative and
was harassing like place that wouldn't
want to continue putting up content so I
just want to tell you guys that any
comments like I said they don't bother
me they don't affect me at all like I
said people told me to kill myself every
day but why I'm telling you this is
think about what you were saying before
you leave a comment on someone's video
like that because people aren't as
strong as I am I'm gonna put that out
there it's not cockiness it's confidence
learn it I'm not saying I'm better than
anyone or better than you I'm saying
that I'm the best I can be so learn the
definition unpatch paul says video
should count like a rant haters so I'm
young a supporter of me hate you so much
love you you know I do my face looks
like it's burning okay
are we like on fire Oh No okay just
lighting oh by the way look at that do
you see that I've had bloody noses all
day today so sorry that I had like
bloody buggers coming out of my nose but
what am i real anyway um um where was I
so yes think about what you are posting
on video because I like I said I am very
strong that I've gone through years of
crap to make me strong I make me who I
am and I think I'm a beautiful person
inside and out not saying that in a
cocky way I think I'm grown I'm not
saying like I'm pretty I'm just saying
that I'm kind and I'm I'm genuinely nice
to people unless they give me reason to
not be and I'm carrying up people and so
for people to come on there and
literally tell me to die because I'm
singing a song mmm
what check yourself no okay because that
shows so much more about you than it
ever could about me and people for
people continuously trying to give me
like fucking voice vocal lessons over
YouTube comment just stop it was a fun
cover that I did in literally 20 30
minutes recorded edited and put it up
and yeah there's echo on it if you don't
like it literally suck a ballsack I
don't care like I'm not gonna just have
my voice normal if I was doing an
acoustic cover fine
whatever I've done that before people
still it shit to say they're like could
you get the auto-tune on this I'm like
no because I filmed in a fucking
rude box there's no body there's no
effects I didn't use my books like some
older covers but for this cover yeah and
it'll look I go on it because every
freaking pop star or anyone not saying
about pop star but everyone uses vocal
effects or reflections there's no
auto-tune you must not know what
auto-tune is if you're commenting that
there's auto-tune on that but there's
literally just a little added echo that
I went over and to myself so I didn't
put an effect on effect on it I
literally under the echo with my own
voice re listening to it over my track
it's like you people who are come to me
comments don't understand how tracks
work okay but anyway I just wanted to
clear that up because I would like to do
continue doing covers because some
people do like them but I don't know
it's just like I don't know how to get
these people who sing their vocal
teachers or voice lesson teachers of my
page just I go away I don't care what
you have to say you're not helping me or
anyone you're just wasting your time and
if you're telling me to die like please
go get help from by in my heart I will
help you get there but I don't need to
die cuz I'm singing a song on me thank
you yes my talk about that and I want to
talk about doing videos like this
because this is literally fun like it's
like ratchet I know like the background
is crooked
and sorry I my family because my face
was burning but I do more videos like
this because this is me like I clap a
lot when I clog I get angry if I go and
rants but that's me and I want to share
that more with you because I have been
very very open ever since I started my
channel like I produced the first few
videos ever put up was like hey massa
and I'm 80 pounds I've never had my
first kiss I've never had a boyfriend
like all this shit that's changed
obviously everything but um you've also
seen me grow in my personal growth
throughout time obviously I'm gonna have
normal video still but I want to start
making my youtube at least more
personable because I'm such a personable
person I'm so real my friends know that
I mean I'll be gross on the ratchet but
I'm also kind caring and true and I
never want you guys to think that I'm
putting on some fake persona or anything
because the girl who's doing that in SF
videos or singing videos or makeup
videos or roasting the news or anything
is me it's just a more put-together me
but this is the me that like everyone
else sees and I'm gonna let you guys in
on it as well so you can be part of my
life completely and fully so we can all
my friends on here and like this will be
my fifth year on YouTube cause you're in
know
and I've enjoyed doing it every second
of it sometimes been hard soon has been
rough you've got you've been through
everything with me but I want to
continue unleashing and releasing more
of myself to you
and be more true not saying I wasn't
true but saying I just want to allow
more of my true self to shine and um I
feel I got started doing that last year
when I started me roasting the juicer
making videos cuz you guys got to see me
a little more in real time like real
reacting so I sing I'm spazzy I cuss but
that's me and now I want to do videos
like this where I just talk about random
shit and I have made a list of things I
want to talk about that aren't like
enough to make like a sit down video
like hey guys a story time okay I was
supposedly this mask on for two minutes
it's been like 20 but oh well um face
falls off tomorrow but I want to do more
videos like this I hope you guys wanted
to Isaac's can be a big waste of time so
leave a comment down below if you think
this is weird but I will be able to put
up more videos like this cuz I wouldn't
really spend much time editing this I'll
just put it up real me um and yeah so
anyway good I know I should put this on
snapchat okay but if you don't follow me
