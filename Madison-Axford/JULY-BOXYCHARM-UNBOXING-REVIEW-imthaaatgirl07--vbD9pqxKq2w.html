basic white girl and wearing into a
secret love pink shirt sorry about that
i was gonna try to get fancy but then i
was like screwed on nut anyway today I'm
in boxy charm unboxing hall review box
video for you it's a monthly box
subscription 21 dollars a month
definitely go check out box a charm it's
my favorite box company by far because
they give you five four to five
full-size products each month and their
delivery time is on point you always get
it like right in the beginning and
you're just like okay okay okay i know
i've done video like this before but
they're so fun so let's get started
first it says summertime knows can you
not it summertime radness greetings from
miami this july we're bringing the heat
to you so keep it cool got your bathing
suit and as lat enjoy the pool because
we got that summertime radness cuz i saw
my dad's an exam redness there's five
products again first bunch is the MDM
float greater than mascara full size of
illuminating mascara that's apparently
not available in the US quite yet um it
says okay now I'm the end of July it'll
be available for thirty-five dollars
through boxy charm but right now it's 21
euros if you're wondering oh this gold
tube ago okay I'm not gonna try them
aspheric I already have a crap ton of
mascara on already I don't think I need
this right now and it won't work since
my lashes already drive with this
mascara that I want I'm show you the
brush it's heavy it's kind of feels like
the better than sex tube um it's a very
pointed brush it looks nice i would
definitely keep you up for this maybe
I'll have this an upcoming make rich
tutorial I really like the chic little
tube goes my gold theme in my room um
but yeah ok cool next we have the
vasanti professional blush brush that
runs for twenty nine dollars I do not
have an actual blush brush I don't I do
I bought one from it cosmetics I was
gonna say
I don't really wear blush but here's
this one by basanti so it's not curved
right angled it's just a nice fluffy
brush and it's very soft um yet firm
it's not flimsy at all and i'm really
loving it but at the fatha uh so yeah
that's what this is um I really like
this it's like really salsa it doesn't
hurt your cheeks or give your cheeks
like a reaction or your skin by the same
time it's very firm like it's not going
to be like move it everywhere it's going
to get that blush on so okay I like this
these products are really expensive so
that's why I'm saying it's worth it to
pay $21 and then get five things that
are one of them's want $21 the next one
is your minerals transparent veil
setting powder I've always wanted a
transparent setting matter I've always
used a colored one this one is
twenty-six dollars it's the medium full
size so I don't is the biggest size that
it comes in but it's the medium to full
size which still is tons of product
apply all your foundation to really
shine and set your makeup for an all-day
performance while minimizing fine lines
and pores so you can buy all these
online other products are I don't think
you can get in stores I think they all
are from online stores cuz box Jarvis
credit trying to promote unknown names
are unknown brands that are just as
great as well known brands but people
don't know about them because they're
not in stores i can't get this happen
cuz it'll seal on it I just want to feel
the texture of this see if I'd put this
all over my foundation because I'm ever
tried transparent like I know it's
see-through clear it just sets it but I
always just use you know cheap little
for dollar cover go powder that I love I
can't open up here we go but I just we
could try new things I don't not like
this color scheme my hair's too dark
this top is too dark too dark all around
this desk is dark everything so daughter
come out look dark but for video it's
cheap it's not like excited okay okay I
get a little on my finger I'm not trying
to you off video so you can see
that white powder on that finger so
let's just see how this L it blends
right in so it disappears it doesn't
leave a white chalky finish on your
foundation ok I'm excited to try that
I'm really excited tricks they don't own
thanks i gotta cracks I think in
parkside I don't own anything off like I
don't have
a clear transparent send Paris that's
exciting next we have the gorge Allah

size um to leave in conditioning spray
that instantly restores your hair and
brings out natural luster running for
2995 that's big as coupon are there get
Twila's old huh ok gorge I guess that's
the brand gorge yeah ok who knew that I
want to see what smells that's what I
care about I spray it on the box ok oh

strong pina colada like coconut but like
strong ok it smells really good it's
most of tropical Jamaican Hawaiian

because I'm not a hair girl my hairy
asian just lays flat and we're happy
that it does that so it'll be exciting
