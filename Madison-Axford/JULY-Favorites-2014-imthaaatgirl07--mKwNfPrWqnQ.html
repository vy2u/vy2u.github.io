everything silent but when I start a
video everyone needs to be doing
everything that they possibly can
outside my house
hey how's go today I'm doing at my July
favorites with the August is here I'm
sorry what I'm going to college this
month this month I'm leaving my house to
go to college what wow so because of
that i thought i would do in july
favorites but without further ado let's
get started okay my first pd favorite is
my Rimmel national runs or that freaking
just cracked it literally this just
happened it just broke but this was my
favorite runs over the past like year
and I went away from it for a while use
Michael the bronzer and i think that i
might like this more than one who
bronzer and feel like it's like a sin to
say that but i don't know i love the
color that this provides i have it in 0
a 2 2 Sun bronze I just love it I love
it so cheap and I love my hello bronzer
don't get me wrong but this one it's a
very strong competitor my next favorite
is my Mac lip liner in world I feel like
everyone got it this month the lip liner
that kind of Jenna uses to make her lips
look 100 billion times bigger and I've
really been loving this is a really nice
new dish mahvish color I just have been
putting us on my lips and either filling
them in entirely with this which I love
to do with lip liners just fell in your
entire lip and looks great or pairing
off the new lip gloss or a new lipstick
and I just have been loving this so I
mean I've never been a huge shopper or
buyer or lover of Mac products I don't
know why but I just haven't been but I
have been really enjoying this so I
definitely go back and check out some
more lipsticks lip liners and stuff like
that by them soon my last beauty product
already is my Sonia Kashuk eyebrow
pencil because I ran out of eyebrow
pencil last week I was using the brown
ways by anastasiya but it wasn't like
the greatest thing ever i didn't want to
repurchase it for the price and when i
was getting from it and i love this I
was a little scared about the color
because my eyebrows are like black but
then once I finally looked at it and put
it on it applies great and it matches my
eyebrows completely and you just kind of
you know disperse it out with a spoolie
throughout your brow and it looks
amazing so moving on to my random
favourites I have um three out of four
Trisha Paytas books I have all of her
books I love Trisha Paytas she's a
youtuber here on YouTube obviously blunt
sundial for MJ is her name she's been my
favorite since the beginning she's a
little provocative and a little
controversial I warn you now if you're
gonna check her out but I love her so
much I have all four of her books the
first one is three of my insanity I'm
lending out to a friend right now so I
don't have it with me but I do have all
of that that I have her second one
stripper Diaries tease and Kirby and
loving it I love her book so much i love
how they're like long enough but they're
still short that because i don't read i
hate reading but there sure enough to
keep my attention span but long enough
to get your money's worth out of it do
you get him off amazon and i just love
them so much i recommend checking out
one or all of her books she's actually
really great at writing and very very
interesting and fun to read and learn
about the only other favorites i had
this month our mom music favorites first
one is don't buy and she ran apparently
about him and ellie goulding's
relationship whatever like that was who
even knew that that was the thing i
don't know maybe I'm just out of the
celebrity relationship but I love this
song I didn't buy the clean version but
they still block out the effort so I
don't know what's up with that I felt
like I wanna hear that word but like I
don't know what happened there anyway
the next song is love again by
pentatonix I featured this in the
beginning intro of my DIY tumblr shirts
for the summer and I love this one so
much it's an acapella group pentatonix
is they won this thing off the third
song is I really love just CEA's 1000
forms of fear girl new album it's
amazing i bought the whole thing I just
large and I love it I love it CEO of a
sudden she's great after chandelier is
just like yeah her song straight for the
knife I've been loved and listening to
you this past month the fourth song is
an oldie but a goodie a gravy i love the
song eiffel 65 blue da ba dee this song
gives me life it sounds like a ringtone
it sounds like a ringtone that never
ends yet it's the greatest thing i've
ever heard like you know i'm blue da ba
dee da ba die da ba dee da ba die da ba
dee da buddha is so great and i love it
