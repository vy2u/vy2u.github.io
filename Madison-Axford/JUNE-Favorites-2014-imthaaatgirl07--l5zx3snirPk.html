march is the month of march what heyo so
today I'm doing my June favorites June
was a pretty quick month for me I can't
believe how fast it really did happen
but it's over now July's here and I'm
going to college in like a month and a
half oh my god um the guy without
further ado let's get into my June
favorites my first favorite is this elf
blush I'm usually not a huge fan of elf
products they're okay but they always
seem to like break or something goes
wrong with them when I buy them but this
brush is literally like a NARS orgasm
doop it's amazing oh my goodness it's
like kind of almost the same color but
it's the same packaging the same amount
of product basically and this is the
shade candid coral to be exact I've been
loving this I have it on right now it's
just a really subtle coral you know nice
nude tone when I'm not trying to go too
heavy or dramatic with my cheek a makeup
this is what I usually go for I
definitely check it out it's like three
bucks three books and it has amazing
amazing color and pigment in it so yes
my second favorite for the month of june
is this covergirl lip gloss in the shade
um melted toffee these are their
colorlicious lip glosses and I've never
been a huge fan of lip glosses but
recently this month of June I have
picked up three lip glosses and I just
I've been loving them more than just a
matte lip I don't know this because it's
summertime I don't know if I'm just like
going through a weird phase or I'm
changing or what but I've been loving
lip glosses that give a really nice
shine and glossy look and finish to your
lips and um this color in particular has
been one of my favorites because it's
very subtle it's very nude and looks
like you don't really have anything on
your lips I mean it's obviously yes like
China in your lips but it's not like an
obnoxious lab color and I've just been
loving this so definitely check out the
colorlicious lip glosses because they
don't stay on forever but that's the
thing about me i hate 24-hour lip
glosses because they really really dry
out your lips so yeah I'd you have to
reapply this quite a bit but I love it
it's super glossy and it's just like I
don't know it gives such great color to
my lips it's great it's great you should
definitely check out this brand in this
color especially I'm
wellthis color my last beauty product
for the month of june is the Too Faced
better than sex mascara when I first got
this I didn't really realize how you
should put it on which you have to apply
two to three coats rather than just one
and i love it i recommend it to everyone
I've got my friend Mackenzie buying it i
have my mom buying it you know everyone
else to try this because it is so great
and i recommend it to anyone no matter
the size of your lashes but I just have
been loving this mascara it seems like a
little bit on the pricier side but I
would not tell you to buy this if it
sucked in the slightest if there was
even a little comment about it I
wouldn't let you buy it but I'm telling
you this is definitely worth it and it's
so heavy I don't know what what is model
so heavy but I love it oh I just love
this mascara next time a random favorite
it's my batiste dry shampoo and it's in
the shades of dark deep brown flavor
sent shade I don't know if it's the one
that does not make brunettes hair like
mine white and powdery looking when it
comes out with celebs dry shampoos do
that or all of them when they come out
they're really up how are you looking
and make my hair white and grey they
don't really see that jablonski judo two
brunette so brunettes you feel me you
get it you understand you have same
problema but this one comes out in a
brownish shade so it's very good for us
brunettes like I said um I don't use
this for like greasy oily hair because I
do take a shower every day oh my god i
know that's good for your hair nutrients
and stuff that's great but I don't
really care it still discussed over
don't take a shower every day however my
hair is very flat and it's very very
straight which is good sometimes but
sometimes I want a little volume to my
hair you know what I'm saying a little
um or something to my hair so I spread
some roots towards the middle or late
part of the day and um yeah it just
gives me some volume and texture to my
hair so it doesn't look like it's just
like lying there on my face in my
shoulders and lastly my favorite music
for the month of june and my first song
is loyal by chris brown and i got the
original version with Lil Wayne and Tyga
I really been enjoying this line I was a
little late to listen to it I don't
really know where I was but I love that
slimy it's really funny and then my
second song is shower by Becky G this is
such a jam song i love love love it to
death my third song if you couldn't tell
by all my videos is chandelier by SIA
the song just like touches you so much
of the music videos
like what what what you know I love this
song and the lyrics and stuff like that
and I played it in like every single one
of my videos but it's really really
really great the fourth favorite all you
sirens by cher Lloyd this is such a
different song perks usually it's like
all these bubble pops little girly songs
and this one was also very touching and
kind of sad likes chandelier so I I mean
I don't like to say that I like sad
souls but I like sad songs and my fifth
favorite song for the month of june is
good time by paris hilton featuring
little weight paris hilton can she sing
no not really but can half the people on
the radio saying no not really i just
like the song cuz it's good if you want
to just jump up and dance i'm not saying
that it's some amazing song and she win
a grammy obviously not but if you just
want a quick little like jam song listen
to good time it's kind of like great
because it's so bad it's like you like
it because it's so not good but i don't
know i don't think it's like bad like
everyone else does like everyone's
hating on it so much and i'm just like
just get up and dance you know so that
was my jean favorites i know it was kind
of quick but i'm excited it's july july
4th coming up soon yay and I yeah I hope
