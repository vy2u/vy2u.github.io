spot again it's just kind of like
wherever I feel like going and if I want
to put the collage back up or if I want
to just film my bedroom so today since I
am doing my January favorites video as I
just feel my bedroom because I'm not
doing a makeup tutorial or anything like
that yes I do have a cold you don't need
to comment about my weird voice if I
sniffle if I cough or if I blow my nose
randomly in the middle of the video but
I have a cold so we're gonna deal with
that also i'm going to go over a few
basic things to people don't ask because
i feel like people ask me a lot like
what i have on my lips or my face or my
earrings whatever like that so i'm going
to go over that before the video so my
sweater or sweatshirt zip up thingy m is
from victoria secret love pink just
hasn't 86 right there and then it says
love pink on the arm you can see that
and it has a little color is super cute
it's turquoise and i love it also on my
lips i have my baby lips cherry me it's
a really nice color it's great
moisturizer and it gives you your lips a
great tint and then um on my ears I
guess this is the last thing then I'll
get started with the video I just have
my cross studs from um bed bath &amp;amp; body
works from try one um my like mitali
balls and then my diamond studs and then
on this ear I have my cross my Italian
balls and then my diamond studs all the
way up my earth so yes I heard a hive
honey and um I am back recording again
because before I was just kind of
putting up pre-recorded videos because I
was stupid busy and did not have any
time at all so I thought I just put
those up I'm sorry I guess I am
recording again I do my January
favorites video today and I'm really
excited so let's get started so I'm
gonna do three random favourites real
quick first they have Sally Hansen's
cuticle massage cream with apricot oil
and this may seem kind of random but my
fingernails and cuticle and nail beds
and stuff are very very like torn up
they're picked at their red and this is
just orange mmm obviously it's orange
and it smells really good and kind of
smells like fruit and stuff like it says
apricot oils in it put this on my
cuticles before you go to bed rub it in
and it's just like lotion before your
cuticles and if you can see is kind of
gross but I have a lot of scratches and
cuts and redness around me
cuz I pick at them when I'm nervous and
this does really help so i'll just do
like kind of like a swatch of it i guess
and show you what it looks like this is
what it looks like when you rub it in so
obviously it's not orange on your skin
but yeah it's really smooth and thick
and i just really like it for cuticle
cream and it was only like two or three
dollars from walmart so i recommend
everyone get this even if you care to
close aren't bad because you want to
keep them healthy looking for your
beautiful nails next we just have my
good old petroleum jelly now this stuff
is like my life I've loved it since
middle school chapped lips chapped hands
um redness like I've been blowing my
nose a lot so I have like redness chaps
crap stuff around my nose which hurts
like heck and so I get just petroleum
jelly which i got from walgreens by
ripped the tag off it was just like
walgreens brand and um I got a huge tub
of it and as you can see it's just clear
this is what it looks like and then it
just blends in its super thick and
smooth and creamy and I like to put this
on is like a hand lotion before bed I'm
I used to put it on my lips but then it
like said that I could recommends you
match one on your lips I was like ha be
good so to really do that anymore but it
does work great if you two have chapped
lips and I'm I used to swear my nose to
thecus chap but my voice is going on
next day I'm Neutrogena alcohol-free
toner now this is so amazing I just uh
Mike hasn't recommended this for me and
I was like okay I'm ganna it's like six
bucks for this huge container of it so I
tried it and I just put it on a q-tip
like after I am wash my face and do
stuff like that I just use this and it
gets off so much extra makeup and dirt
and stuff like that and it's just really
amazing how much is left on your skin
after you clean it like five times so
this is great at getting the excess dirt
and oil and makeup off and I just love
it and says the most ripped skins
natural moisturizers my skin feels so
much cleaner that I know that it's like
really getting all the dirt and grime
off my skin next I have three makeup
products first day of Elfstone
correcting concealer in light beige I
really want a concealer that was like in
a form like this so it's like a little
wand like because I usually had like am
stick that like I rolled on and I didn't
really like that I mark time
that I have this now it's really nice
and it covers up my under eye circles
very well and um yeah I like this line
dollar please excuse my voice I've just
nice we have maybelline colossal volume
Express see I'm cat eyes one and I
really really love this I just got it
recently and it replaced my maybelline
great lash lot / just cuz i was out of
that this is what the brush looks like
it just it gets every single lash and it
doesn't clump at all um it gets like all
the way to the end and I all searches
bottom lashes really well without
getting it like all over your skin I
just love this the brush is just so what
car the brush is just so like um easy
youth haha this was five or six dollars
at Target and if you haven't seen this
enough it's in this favorites video
again it's bronze booster by physicians
formula this is just such a great
bronzer it gives such a healthy glow and
it doesn't and doesn't give your skin
like a fake cakey orangie look it's a
really nice neutral light like bronze
brown tint and I love it for my pale
face in the winter and it's just it
works great I love us i take it
everywhere okay so next I have some
