favorites I'm a little late considering
its January 10th janya right hands whoa
februari 10th but I still really wanted
to the video because i love doing
favorites videos and I'm gonna try not
to miss one this year fingers crossed
fingers crossed and I have some
band-aids in my hands if you see that
ignore that it's dry skin what can you
do just I'm just warning you you see the
band-aids yeah anyway I don't have that
many favorites but I'm going to try to
do a new thing which is keeping my
videos a little bit shorter cuz I've
gotten a lot of not like complaints but
just kind of like requests um that I do
short my videos and like I do understand
that because i know that i don't wanna
watch like a 20 minute favourites video
you know so i'm gonna be quick I don't
think I need to go on I got three to
five minute explanation about a lipstick
that you know I tend to do so so I'm
gonna try my best to hold back and
refrain from English elaborating but
that further ado let's get into my
January favorites it's my first favorite
I recently gotten is my V or a pore
strips and I've just recently noticed
that my pores are a bit big and I saw
like dirt in them so I wasn't happy with
it and I really wanted to fix that or do
the best that I could to kind of clear
them and this is the i don't know couple
of you know any other brand that has
pore strips but this is literally the
only brand i can find at a drugstore
target i bought these at target um that
made pore strips the only brand was be
all right anyway i bought them and
there's 10 strips in here and there were
eight and then to free strips or
whatever it says right there for seven
dollars i think it was it's a bit on the
more expensive side but i tried you out
and I really really have been enjoying
them it says use like one over three
days so you really have to be careful
with these kids think yeah you know you
can go overboard use it too often but
yeah I've really been enjoying these and
my skin feels super soft and looks super
good I think and clear um after I use
them the next thing I have is literally
ancient it's my great lash
clear Joe mascara I think and this is
what I use for my eyebrow gel is
literally disgusting you can see like
all of the electric colors like brown
and gray I don't know why it turned gray
but it's literally gross I'm sorry you
have to see this budget uh you've used
this every day since like I don't even
know okay Eddie a new one it's really
bad but it won't run out so I don't want
to buy a new one the wrappers falling
off I don't know how long about this but
anyway it just keeps your lashes in
place because mine have been hard to
tame recently so I've just been like one
and they're good to go um it's helped
some stay you know nice that look like a
mess so I recommend this is by
Maybelline but I needed a new one my
next favorite is surprisingly a blush
I've never been a fan of blushes I
always go to bronzer but this is my elf
blush in the shade a pink passion is
three dollars at Target and I really
love this color it's a super super
bright pink it's not really picking it
up let's see there we go really bright
pink and I love it it gives such a pop
of color on your cheeks and I knew that
if I was gonna wear and do a blush it
had to be like a huge bright color um
rather than just like a dim neutral
color no it has to be this crazy one and
I really really like this one again this
pink passion and definitely check out el
blushes they're actually really
pigmented in really really great um
providers of color for the cheap price
that they are next we have lipstick
which is also surprising for me because
I didn't really like two lipsticks
either but it's my revlon colorburst lip
butter lipstick in 010 raspberry pi
sarahbelle 93 x had a similar one to
this and i saw her wearing it oh it
looks all drink okay it looks kind of
gross sorry about that um but it's just
a beautiful beautiful reddish-pink color
on my band it looks so weird I just love
it i've won it so much more to school in
videos and i never ever wear lipstick
but this is so beautiful much line my
lips and then pop this right on top and
it's good to go I love Revlon lip butter
you should definitely check them out
there about 750 I think at a drugstore
and Revlon lip sticks are great revlon
and L'Oreal they're my favorite
drugstore lipsticks oh yeah but i love
the raspberry color one
to my last beauty favorite for the month
of January was my maybelline eyestudio
legendary lilac 110 palette and um I
don't really like / blipping eyeshadows
because I feel like it makes you look
like you like pink eye or something but
I picked this one up and I has a lot of
great colors i used this in my
valentines day tutorial in a you stirred
a lot on every day recently so if you
can see these colors this is like a
highlight white shimmery color here's
like a duller purple here's a dark plum
and then this is just a light magenta I
usually pick one of these as a base this
is a highlighter and that is the crease
color and they just work so perfect
together and I really been enjoying this
palette it's super tiny but there's so
much product in here my favorite app of
the month has been twitter i love it so
much I've literally tweeted way too much
it's it's crazy i'm almost at 2000
tweets literally nuts i love it so much
it's literally so fun for some reason to
like i don't know i just love like
saying things and and writing little
posts and slick status updates or
whatever it's just like really fun to me
and my links are obviously always in the
downbar and after my beauty videos so
yeah i i'm on twitter this is my this is
my twitter got a lot of pictures myself
huh and lastly one of my favorite
categories music so my first music
favorite is the song let her go by
passenger this one just kind of became
more popular and I really really really
have been enjoying it super super cute
and I really just have been loving it um
it's just so relaxing and cute like I
said in I know I really really like it
on the second one is my best steel its
pomp I and I love vesti oh they're my
new favorite band I have their album bad
blood and it's just really really
enjoyable I love listening to it again
it's really like relaxing and slower and
I don't know why I love this song
especially so much but maybe because
it's on you know the pop 40 charts but I
just really really really really love
this song it's just like so cool the way
it sounds especially the beginning
it's just so blah next we have Lords
team of her album Pure heroine I like a
few songs my lord but I'm not like on
the Lord bus like I'm not like oh yes
like you know I feel like everyone else
in the world is however I was a late
bloomer with this song and I just
recently started listening to it and
liking it for that matter but um it's
really good her voice is so simplistic
and amazing and lastly and even older
song and I'm don't you worry child by
swedish house mafia I swear a new
Swedish House Mafia before anyone else
when I listen to their song save the
world like five summers ago but um I
love this song so much the meeting is
amazing and it's literally just the
greatest jam ever ever the greatest
dream ever my hair it's crazy so yeah
that was my music for the month and
lastly the thing that I want to talk
about art my new videos I'm putting up
and um which is my music videos or not
music videos but videos where I'm
singing in I've gotten a lot of positive
feedback um um my singing videos which
thank you so much anyone who's comment
is I read them all I my computer's like
not letting me respond to some of them's
like some of us says reply but like more
than half a dozen so I don't want to
reply to some and then I can't to others
but just Oh your guys comments literally
make my day they make my life I'm so
happy when I read them and um even
though my friends and family have been
supportive so if it's really really
really great on the outcome that my
singing videos I've got and um I don't
know I'm just so amazed by the responses
that i got like I said um I don't want
to make this a singing channel by any
means I know some people were like
what what what I'm necro 7 makeup
fashion beauty fashion making fashion
singing singing and I'm sorry to just
like hit you up guard cuz i know i was
just like your song we can't stop
reading acted like I was like pumping
them out and I love singing I've done it
for um while I only really song like
really some decently for about two years
but I mean I've Sun the whole life you
know I spent like 12 years um it wasn't
good but I'm taking it more seriously
the past two years and i love it and i
think i'd become okay i was literally
tone-deaf an awful but I worked for what
I have now with my voice and them it's
something I really really love to do
it's a great hobby of mine just like
youtube so i thought i'd share it i'm
sorry if you don't like my singing
videos but i really really enjoyed doing
them they're very fun and i just have a
great time recording it and putting it
up to see your guys's responses and and
so that you can hear me sing because I
know I always kind of sing in my video

like you can sing mixing videos and I
never was going to because it is a
beauty fashion makeup channel um and I
wasn't gonna put random singing videos
up but now that I am I want to continue
