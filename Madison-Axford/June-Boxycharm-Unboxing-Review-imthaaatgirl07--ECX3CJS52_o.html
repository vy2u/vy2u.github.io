exciting video i never thought i would
do these kind of like monthly box kind
of videos like schumann jewel meant you
know if see whatever i never thought i'd
be a part of that because i don't know i
was like i'm not gonna pay money to get
like tiny ass products like that's not
what I'm here for but I found a company
that I love and you pay about $21 I
think it is and you get five four to
five full-size products each month
full-size that's when I was like okay I
got to do this because i don't want
Travis to his products like if I really
love it that's not enough anyway for the
company that I found is called a boxy
charm and um this is the end of june one
because it's not rely so i'm pretty sure
this in the June box and i got five
full-size products i have not opened it
yet so i'm going to get this first
impression with you guys so I didn't
like see anything you're trying out
before i'm showing you anyway this is
Baxter box I love it I'll leave all the
links in the description box below so
you can check that out to you because I
do you think this is the box that it's
worth your time rather than others so
I'm going to open it up and it says
hello charmer right here very cute and
inside it has all these little pink
frilly good buddy things and then
there's two little cards so let's see
what these are first one says sea leve
like c'est la vie Betsy okay see life's
beauty charmers sail away with us as
they take time to coast the open waters
for adventure don't get tied down let
the seats that you free just as life
should be oh it's so cute okay so this
is like a summer see kind of thing okay
and then five the five products that
they gave us this month are listed on
the back where you can buy them the
websites what they do with our used for
and how much they run for typically so
you get $21 you know you pay and you get
these with one pod right here thirty
eight dollars and you get five of them
or $21 am I the only one that's like
thinks this is the most amazing thing
ever I don't know maybe other boxes like
this but I know this one is and I don't
know about other boxes but I love this
so I also had this which is it it's just
like a boxy charm exclusive sale enjoy
twenty dollars off videos or more from
Molly beads so we're gonna throw in Mali
beads promo but yeah so give you a
coupon now into the pie products that I
see here ok so first thing I'm going to
get my little card a minute card okay a
slower chlorophyll lifting mask
okay so if this one s lower chlorophyll
lifting mask paraben free so this is
what it looks like it's like a big big
jug let's see it's 50 milliliters as a
product oh okay feels so cool Oh what
it's green okay it smells really good
sounds very clean oh my god it's like
jello it feel do you see this I'm not
 y'all I'm sorry holy crap okay I
jello but really sticky okay that's cool
let's read what this does okay this mask
is made up of natural milk proteins
plant extracts seaweed extracts and
minerals that tightness can't help in
bow oh it helped enhance blood
circulation and diminish fine lines your
skin will appear luminous and noticeably
firmer use twice weekly when dry rinse
with warm water that's cool so just
supposed to you know do stuff to your
face what I don't know how much this
will benefit me because I am late teen I
don't know it seems like a product older
woman would use no offense in any way
shape or form but i don't know if i need
to like tighten my face already but you
know we'll see if i gave these fine
lines to go away but okay i'm excited to
try that out ah the next thing on here
is bellapierre cosmetics kabuki brush
and i lost my little kabuki brush
Tanner's ratchet and promote Roy secret
so get a new one um okay so there's no
League loose fibers that's good because
I hate when you let planet a brush and
all the things come out like elf brushes
that help happens quite a lot um okay
it's very soft very flimsy if you can
see that um okay philip here is best
when we crush his perch for Oliver
powder applications is super soft dense
brush pens okay then thrush distributes
product evenly and quickly making it a
stable for any mineral makeup routine I
so this is a strictly powder brush I
don't know if I'd use this to apply
foundation because it would just make it
a sloppy mess but definitely for loose
powder i will be using this as a new
brush this is very cute and compact and
small so it won't take up that much room
and no I like it it's very solid next
weekend duche doge a douche whoops i
don't know this is going click click
lipstick full size okay
see what color it is right click click
oh that's addictive okay so you like hit
the bottom it pops out I guess yeah
they're yeah it's just a nice like
brownish reddish pinkish lipstick very
neutral a lot of red undertones I love
that you just pop them again click it
back in that's fine okay the click click
lipstick is the ultimate fashion
accessory it's a perfect blend of beauty
color and fashion with its sheer and
smooth lightweight and non sticky
formula formula non-sticky that's great
to know infuse with soothing and
protective ingredients that leave your
lips feeling good all day I mean your
swatch of this oh okay it's very sheer
and very smooth and not sticky I love it
it's more like it's one of like a red
color actually on something red Auburn
undertones I like how it's not sticky
and it's very sheer so it's not too
overpowering you're not to worry about
it like putting it on and like being
crazy red it's very sure and you can
blend it easily if you need to do so
that's cool i like that i like the click
click click clack click click click
click lipstick okay next we have the
beauty crop lightning crew highlighting
cream and the cessful size which I'm a
I'm gonna trust it but it's super tiny
what beauty crops lightning crew
highlighting cream is an oil-free
lightweight highlighting clean that adds
healthy luminous glow packed with
vitamin C and powerful antioxidants like
pineapple and green tea this
highlighting frame will accentuate and
highlight your best features while
nourishing and brightening the skin ok
let's open this baby up oh oh yes oh
what war work
oh my earring Bell off oh god I got it
everywhere
well look oh my god my hearing ok take
you light and crew Heather me a little
bit ok oh oh dear
I can't tell this is working for me um
it's not picking up that much it's just
kind of picking up like a line of MIT uh
okay maybe if I had bronzer on it was
all even out and if I didn't apply it
with my freaking finger but we're
working with what we got today overall
maybe it's cuz my phone date Wow um
don't look as bad I thought it would I
mean I like the product I like the
consistency and I like the pearly
champagne color that comes out um I
loved it on my hand like you can kind of
see the shimmer I don't know if it's cuz
i don't because my foundation color is
off or don't have bronzer and blush on
oh god the side looks kind of wood
already dried not amazed with it but i
want to give it a second chance maybe if
everything was not set already and i
didn't have like tons and tons of powder
on my face already it would be different
but it just feels a little weird on my
face anyway last product in this box is
the ncl a nail lacquer nail like nail
lacquer nail care now look I don't know
how I word um and it is this sore here
in the color well the nudes collection
it says and the color you know if it
doesn't have a color
oh my goodness I do like this color it's
kind of pinky purpley undertones of this
nude if you can see it you probably
remember least yet it's very sheer and
it's not in your face which I like so
that was the box to chat box for the
month of june I am really happy the
products I can't wait to try them out
and I'm sorry I've gum in my mouth
