yo so today I'm doing my june / july
favorites I know tune is well over um
half a month ago over what did what it's
well over am as well so it's half as
well over half of the month or ok Jim
just a long time ago and I wasn't even
gonna do a June favorites but I don't
have I have seriously two products for
june and july combined I was like should
I even dude you like chefs wait till
August to do favorites but I love his
videos and I had to do it for you guys
mainly cuz i had a lot of good music and
so i want to show you those but i have
right now i'm working on and I for
beauty products and like two other
things and I have nothing this summer
it's just been a lot of hanging out with
friends and chillaxin and I haven't
actually gone to like shopping or stores
a lot and I found you know the things I
show you i love and i could show you
more things but I really have nothing
over there that you know I love a lot of
stuff over there by right showed it to
you or I just don't love it so I really
like these things i'm going to show you
because there's seriously two months
come on you think i would have like 100
things unless would be like a 25 minute
video but i have like two so I mean
let's get right into the video first be
a project I have I'd had for a while and
originally I didn't like it but it's elf
liquid eyeliner and brown and I hate
brown eyeliner but for some reason this
liquid comes out like almost like black
so I really like that because I prefer
black / brown eyeliner and originally I
had I started out with like a black
liquid liner before I got any other kind
of liquid or gel thing and um I didn't
have a brown and the brush on that was
really thick which made it nice and easy
to make a fat cat eye and stuff like
that so when I picked this one up at
target for a dollar this is the brush
it's like super tiny like a little
needle and I was like I hate this it's
so flimsy I can't do anything with
little brushed and it makes it super
heading line but then again I was like
wait actually kind of wanted that I
didn't always want that huge thick cat I
you know the really dramatic glam look I
wanted like a thin little line and I'd
really reckon
I'm picking it up if you're new to
liquid eyeliner because you don't always
want that huge thick line and this is
pretty easy to control if I do say so
myself next beauty thing is from mary
kay cosmetics and it's just an eyebrow
spoolie but it's not like when you see
on the end of a benefit or Maybelline
eyebrow pencil and I got this in a set
for my grandma so I don't know how much
it was or what store she particularly
got it at but she gave it to me and I
really love it it's huge and it's nice
rather than just having like a cheap
spoolie that comes on the end of an
eyebrow pencil it's nice to have like a
really good long were sold expensive one
and I can't really live without smoothly
because after I put on like my
foundation I'll get some foundation on
my eyebrows and I want to fill him in or
you know cover the foundation that I got
on them up and so I used this first to
like brush it out some of the foundation
just get them nice and big you like
ready to be you know it filled in and I
just love doing that I do it before and
after I fell in my brows and I just
noise such a difference in my brows in
my shape and that the color of them and
I'm really really enjoying it this
utensil then we have Neutrogena oil-free
moisture for combination skin and I was
looking for a face moisturizer in the
morning and at night and something you
can wear into your make up something
that was just like not too greasy but I
could put to you know moisturize the dry
spots on my skin and stuff like that so
of course I'm going to go with my
favorite face care and skincare brand
which is neutrogena everything I you
pretty much used on my face is from
there and this doesn't clog pores
alcohol free fragrance free as allergy
tested because i do have sensitive skin
so i did look at that but so far I've
had this for about two weeks I think and
I'm really really liking it I put it
under my makeup in the morning like I
said in that night before I go to bed
after I've shaken up on my makeup and I
haven't noticed some extreme difference
but my makeup does stay on longer if I
put it it's not like in a substitute for
a primer but it almost could be because
it's not may just help it stay on longer
but it really does keep it there when I
put it under my wake up in the mornings
which I do worry BB cream so I don't
have like a lot of lot of foundation on
my skin um but it's just really nice and
it comes out white and it just goes on
clear and I don't know I just not really
liking this my skin feels a lot
healthier and like more hydrated and
doesn't feel as like I'm gonna gross and
dry which it was doing because the Sun
was drying it out at this for twelve
dollars at Target and she definitely
check out this or any skincare product
by neutrogena and already my
last P product is the greatest thing
Navajo and it's a BB cream by Garnier
and I got the SPF 21 light to medium 24
combination to oily skin skin a new
miracle skin Perfector oh my gosh oh my
gosh um I tried revlon and maybelline's
BB creams and like some of the little
trial things but I had the full size of
Maybelline revlon's I liked Maybelline's
is fine revlon's I hated it was really
greasy and disgusting it was the photo
ready one but this one I saw blonde
sundell for MJ had it in like a
favorites or target haul or something
and so I I think was a favorites video
so I wanted to pick this up just because
she had it and I do if I see someone
that I like that has it just go out and
buy it and they have a lot of different
options still different colors as to be
offered without so many different things
that i would suggest I my friend
Mackenzie already got this and it's the
SPF 21 um and it's I got light to medium
because I'm Santa is pale but it comes
out not orange but it gives you a lot of
color and it's really nice because it's
not too heavy it comes out really
liquidy and that's not my bad thing is
like there's so much like as soon as you
open the cap like just don't just like
flooding out because it's so watery but
once it goes on it's fine it's not like
greasy or oily or sweaty looking on your
face it really perfects your skin and i
haven't had a breakout knock on wood in
so long i don't know maybe it's aight
cuz i changed it products i'm not
wearing as heavy a makeup but my skin is
doing really really really really well
and um I'm just I just I I don't even
know to say i love this i saw that
people didn't like it because of the
liquid factor and because it was a
little orange ii but seriously if you
blend and don't go overboard with it
it's not it doesn't make you look fake
tan or fake bake or like you put too
much bronze around unless you put five
coats of it on you're going to be
totally fine as a BB cream matta
foundation and I just in love with it I
got it for a target for twelve dollars
such a great product and I've never
really been that happy with a face
product ever selected me go to my random
favourites first I have dr. pepper I
used to drink Coke all the time and I
washed it out so slow wet is to drink
Coke all the time but i recently switch
to dr. pepper I don't know if it's
necessarily better I think it's worse
because there's more calories just love
dr. pepper so much so sweet and I don't
I'm just in love with it's my new
favorite drink I just drank like 10
minutes and one day I drink life for
those that was not very good but I
really really really really cannot live
without it then I have a TV show and
this is the first season of gossip girl
now I haven't been watching this one
necessarily because the rapper still on
it but on netflix they have like I don't
have to all the seasons the season after
season five so i don't know if this is
season six but i've just been watching
it and watching and watching it I'm on
like the third season I think and
there's like a 25 episodes each season
that a 45 minutes long so it takes a
long time to get through this is
jam-packed with drama and room and in in
romance and I just love it you should
definitely check it out it's a great
chain flake there's a little some um um
profanity in it like if it was a movie
I'd probably be like pg-13 so if you're
younger please ask your parents or watch
out for that i'm not going to promote
something that does have you know older
material and order things in it to my
younger viewers i'm not like to watch
this rels buts my favorite shows month i
know a lot of my viewers watch it and on
my friends do and i would suggest it to
me i just kind of started on my own
because i had heard about it and i
absolutely love it one of my favorite
shows of all time and we already on
music because that's what a fail i am i
have absolutely nothing to share in the
past two months will July's not over but
you know it's almost over so i i'm not
gonna find anything else so I'm
storeroom and I've been going shopping
anytime soon except to work and all this
volunteer stuff and ok anyway what am I
talking about on to music we have nine
favorites I was going to make a 10 but
then I wasn't just gonna pick a random
song just make it 10 so these are my
name favorites have a listening to them
non-stop and yeah let's go first I have
carried away by passion pit I know this
song is more popular than the other
songs but I do have like a lot of their
cds and i'm getting my friends to start
listening to them and like them and i
just love them and they're so like happy
and I just like really like listening to
this so it's from the album gossamer
next we have I don't know some people
hate the song I personally liked it even
those like 12 days long and it's get
lucky by daft punk featuring fro really
a mess off their random access memory
next we have um can't stop made the u.s.
radio edit by afrojack &amp;amp; shermanology
off an EP so this is what it looks like
I heard it when I was in Miami
next we have it was free is single week
so oh my god I love the song and it's
similes made in America and it's just
the free single
next we have when my favorite singers
Natalia Kills Saturday night her new
single oh my god the song is freaking
amazing and I don't know why no why more
people don't know of her but you
definitely should have it album cover it
so funny I think it's her and she's like
a little or something
next we have to some new lows the other
side it's a single
then we have oh my gosh crazy kids
Mukesh your offer a warrior and the song
has a lot of cuss words in it but oh my
god is so good
then this is my my least favorite at all
home but I had to include it because
i've recently liked it more than I ever
had because I never listened to it for
the first like eight months was out but
it's the way featuring Mac Miller by
Ariana Grande
finally we have my total summertime the
best song that's ever come out seriously
we can't stop by Miley Cyrus there's so
much controversy over the song and
people that don't like it but it's like
my anthem
so that was my June July favorites video
I really hope you enjoyed n I didn't
have that much but I really like the
things that I have because I took a lot
of trying to decide what was when I put
this in this video so it wasn't just a
bunch of random products to make up for
the loss of my June favorites enjoy if
it was just like kind of the mash-up
thing but really I didn't have that much
so I hope you enjoyed this video and my
songs that I'll be linked below and
thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
