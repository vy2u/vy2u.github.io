and I'm super excited because this is
like the first time I've ever been to
lush um I absolutely love it I can give
it a 10 a 10 review because I got so
much stuff actually for the first time
going and this is a really great source
so you decided to try all my products
let's get started so first they just
gave me this lush times and I know like
I didn't buy this but I think it's very
cool that they have their own like store
newspaper and it's like the jid has like
so many pages full of all the products
and I really like and I'm excited to
look at this it's the Christmas one
Santa okay so what I love about the
store is how you can try everything to
like make sure you like it like almost
everything you can try and like see if
it's worth buying and stuff like that
and um I really really love the stars so
the first thing I got is this little
white mustache like crease bubbles so
you like twirl around some water and
then you put it in like your tub and it
just like makes a huge bubble bath for
you and it's just super cute it's like
glittery and shoots like a mustache it
smells amazing the next thing I got is
like from the Holiday Collection they
have just this little cute santa thing
and um it gets off like any dead skin on
your hands or your body and it really
helps exfoliation and stuff and feel
like bad thing is like if you get this
whole thing wet it totally like crumbles
and disintegrates and a big itty bitty
pieces so you need like break it off and
I don't want to break in but you have to
use it so yeah but this smells good and
it was actually pretty cheap ok the next
thing I got I got two of because I loved
it so much a nail they like only have
these little containers and they're like
we'll just tell you two of them um
instead of like making me a bigger tub
so it's like bokken so if this thing
called Oh to fix you know read wide says
it's a fresh face mask and get your own
fix with the blend of bananas vanilla
ground almonds and oats to cool and
nourish irritated skin and I just
sometimes my skin is red and kind of
black she after I take my makeup off and
exfoliating stuff so this is just like a
regular face mask you just put it on for
10-15 minute and then take it off and
supposed to help your skin so I was like
why not and I how could they got to
because this face mask really appealed
to me and this is what the effects looks
like made out of like oats and nuts and
bananas and it's just kind of creamy
kind looks like oatmeal almost next I
got this thing my sister and had this
before she let me try it one time and I
liked loved it so I was like I'm
definitely getting that whenever I go so
we went today and it's called whoosh and
it's shower gel but so I called shower
jelly and I'll show you what it looks
like it's like this turquoise gel and i
love it it smells so good it's open to
play with it just it smells like it kind
of feels like candy but they all do so
this just like it's like jiggly can see
it's duly oh my god I didn't love it
it's just you break little pieces off
and use them as shower gel it like its
ends up and it's really amazing like you
can reuse it a few times but not that
money I'm really excited that I got this
cuz I loved my sisters in the last two
things that I got are different but same
sort of thing and they are their lips
scrubs oh my gosh I had heard about
these lips scrubs from tons of people
have they like exploited your lips and
did you like lick it off I'm not sure if
I want to lick it off yeah and I think
that sounds kind of janky but whatever I
might you know you never know the sound
the first time I got is their bubble gum
lip scrub and so it looks like so you
just there's tons in here in the last
like a year or so unlike other projects
the only lasts like a month but anyway
um this one looks like and I'm very very
excited to try these because again my
sister had these she like goes to wash
all the time and I don't it's kind of
weird but whatever um I just don't
really have time but anyway she had this
in bubble gum I think and she really
liked it so I was like hey I'm going to
get one I never tried hers but I'm i
know i'll like it cuz i love like
putting stuff on my lips and making them
like smooth and just stuff like that
these were ten dollars piece and then i
also got mint juleps lip scrub
I feel like there's not as much as in
this one this one smells like vanilla
and mint and stuff and this one smells
exactly like bubblegum so strong but I'm
just really excited to exploit my list
is becoming um the winter and my lips
are getting dry and you know all that
nasty stuff like everyone's chapped and
and sometimes you know chapstick and
stuff like I've doesn't always work and
you need to exfoliate them at least you
know once a week I'm high going to do it
two or three times a week as well as
using the masks um they suggested using
the masks every other day which may seem
like a lot but if it fixes the red
blotchy parts on my of my skin then i
will use in every other day clémence
video was quick I just wanted to show
you what I got from lush because I feel
like I got quite a bit for my first time
I was super super impressed with it I
love this store now and I will
definitely be back so subscribe to my
channel and thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
