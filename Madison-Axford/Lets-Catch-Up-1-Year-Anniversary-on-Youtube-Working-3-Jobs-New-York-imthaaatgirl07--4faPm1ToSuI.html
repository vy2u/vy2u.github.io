because I've been on YouTube for a year
um today November 16 hey yo so where do
I begin where do I go with this video
what am I trying to say I don't have
anything planned out but it is my one
year anniversary here on YouTube cleft I
obviously have to make a video today
because I'd been on YouTube for a year
um today November 16th so I put in my
first video my November favorites and
today I'm chewing unfortunately not in
November favorites yet but i'm doing a
ketchup video like where the heck
haven't been for literally the past
month and there there's not like one
main thing that went on that cost me to
halt my video recordings or just stop
doing youtube for a while I'm nothing
like big happen it's just I got busy and
I don't want to use that as an excuse
because everyone is is that you know I I
got busy and I didn't have time for
YouTube but that's literally what
happened I don't I don't think that I
understood like how much YouTube
actually took because sure I only have
four classes to see at school but I'm
also working like two jobs and also
volunteered the library quite often
which is almost like a third job except
you don't get paid for it but literally
I have three jobs that I'm trying to
control it and handle it and you know go
to and I see you give us a job because
i'm a partner of south holland and
youtube is a huge job and it was a huge
part of my life and it still isn't is
going to be but you know YouTube used to
be one of my top priorities and the fact
that it hasn't been one of my top
priorities the past month is just so
heartbreaking for me and I hated it and
every day I would saying wow it's been a
week since i put up a video two weeks
three weeks up four weeks a month you
know and i hated thinking that but i
could not find time to sit down and
reported video um i'm back at bread co
nie oh I work right go as store hit gap
which I will be down at gap in december
and i'm just going to bread co then
because i'm just leaving gap and then
the library i like to volunteer you know
and it's a good way to give back to my
community no i don't get paid for it or
like I don't get hours for school my
school course
since leaving school early course um
from the library but I do um like
helping out and it's nice and and I have
school I may not have you know extremely
difficult EP classes but I do have to
pretty you know decently hard classes
that I need to study and do work for
they're not just blow off classes two of
them are easier but two of them are hard
and and once even college credit you
know once for college credit and love
recording videos i love them feel my
heart and i have a lot of ideas i was
just i have a lot of ideas now I'm one
thing I was kind of just burn Anna on it
for a while I was just like you know I
don't him took the time to do it I Drive
ideas I'm gonna be down for a while and
I didn't want to be done for a while and
I'm sorry I didn't say anything but I
didn't know it was gonna be that long I
did not know how it's gonna be gone for
a month literally a month of like
someone's from october to the mill in
november from the mill walked over to
nola november i was just not
non-existent on youtube apparently and
so I just want to catch up and tell you
some things have been going on in my
life I'm again I am truly sorry that um
I haven't put up a video and forever my
loyal subscribers we hit 2,000
subscribers and it was new in putting up
videos because I did not have the time
and it's not like I quit a job and now I
have time but I finally realized how
much I love YouTube how much I missed it
how much it is a responsibility just
like gap radko or the library I I'm part
number stylehaul that is a
responsibility that I must take care of
and I can't just blow it off maybe
because it's something that I love to
you know something like you're not going
to gap or like volunteering it might not
be always the funnest thing ever in the
world um youtube is and YouTube stuff
that I love to do I love to talk and I
love to talk about makeup and fashion I
love doing that and I don't know it just
in my mind I just I don't know I don't
know I didn't see this priority because
it definitely definitely is a priority
and I am back and better than ever ah
just in time for black friday halls and
stuff like that but i have a lot of
great awesome hopefully love of videos
coming up that are planned and literally
after going to work in like 20 minutes
i'm trying to get just get this catch a
video and because it's my one year
anniversary and thanking all of you so
much for giving me 2100 about ish
subscribers in the one year that i've
been on here that's incredible um and
I'm front of stylehaul in a nap and
Sigma and
and I've gotten contacted by companies
and it's just so cool to be given all of
these opportunities in literally a year
the year flew by i still remember me
last year and i feel like i've changed
so much for the better i was so awkward
when i first started YouTube but i do
feel so much more confident within
myself and um I'm just really happy with
where I am at life right now so I'm just
going to go through oh I'm literally
just gonna go through their Twitter
Instagram to see any big events and what
happened that I'm going to put up
pictures up with that or tweeted about
if you do follow me on instagram I do
tweet a lot now too so I will leave
those like links below obviously like
they always are and I had some time to
hang out with friends you know which was
nice because friends are always on the
back burner of my life which sucks but
I'm just so busy doing everything else I
sometimes don't have time do you don't
hang out with everyone and and it's not
my last year here before I go to college
so I want to try to get you know hangout
sessions in with everyone and get to
know everyone that maybe I didn't get to
talk to as much last year or years in
the past you know and so I'm trying to
do everything I can in senior year I
thought was going to be easy breezy I
was gonna have tons of time to do you
too it's not even funny how many do so I
was gonna put up and this has been the
most like busiest year of my life
considering that i have three jobs and
trying to work them all and i'm trying
to you know like I just uh I don't know
I really really didn't plan on it being
this busy or leaving YouTube for such a
long period of time because I literally
I said literally like a tee time sorry I
don't have the time to just sit down get
all ready for a youtube video and come
up with ideas and and have the time to
edit in an episode and export be
creative and do things you know outsides
just little realm of my bedroom and me
talking you know like fashion videos
outside like you have to plan those and
I didn't have time and I still don't
know if I'll have time to do those at
this point in my life but I definitely
will in the next few months and be
looking forward to those cuz I'm back
like I said previously anyway I didn't
get my tickets for the money cyrus
concert if you know me you know i'm
obsessed with miley cyrus on twitter if
you follow me are on instagram i'm just
i'm obsessed obsessed and i'm seeing her
in april and super duper excited I can't
even tell you I'm going with Mackenzie
of course huh and I'm just really really
excited and I'm thrilled that I got
tickets so that was very amazing um but
April's so far away oh well I
got back from New York literally last
weekend my family went on another trip
like we did last year um if you remember
all right no I went on my new york trip
lecture in September and then I started
my new channel in November so I didn't
really talk about that I think I'd said
some things about like oh you're the
scarf from New Yorkers I like that but a
new york hall will be up soon and i did
not get that many things actually i
think that my thing is kind of sad but
you know what can you do um and so we
went there for on Thursday and came back
sunday was a short little weekend trip
but it was really really fun and really
nice nothing really big has happened
just the fact that i am trying to
control three jobs i'm graduating high
school in like six months or five months
I don't know it's crazy I'm really
excited though I'm going to college with
my best friends which is just incredible
I guess it's about it I feel like I
haven't been gone for that long leg when
I look back on like pictures and things
that I've done since um my homecoming
video my sister tiger whatever I been a
blast um but like what I look at how
long that is it's a month I just I
haven't done that much literally it's
just school and work in school and
working maybe a friend hang out here or
more work you know and so I'm really
sorry about that again there won't be
another gap like this for a long time if
ever I'm really sorry about that but I
am that guy that came back and my room
has changed to expect in your room tour
it's kind of a kind of a mess but she's
going all over the place cuz like the
wallpapers ripped off you probably saw
that in past videos though that was a
while ago that I did that my bed's moves
around it's on the ground I think I said
that in other videos too but it's just
really different i have a lot more space
and I'm really happy with it but this is
amol your for like eight more months
it's kind of like why are you why you
change in your room but whatever doesn't
matter and thank you for watching this
