I will be reacting to my league first
time listen of Ed Sheeran's who album
divide I have never been like that edge
here and stand but like so good tunes or
some box you know like here and there
I'm not like the biggest and Sherin
lover I don't know I think he's an
amazing singer and songwriter I just
don't ever find myself like running to
listen to his songs but new album out
I'm just going to a stupid give it any
first time through obviously I've heard
shape of you and everyone this world has
but I haven't heard any other song on it
then I'm aware of so I'm gonna go
through track by track and hopefully
this will become written but where I'm
going to get my true responses and
reactions to a song if you are an edge
here in like super fan awesome for you I
don't mean to offend if I say I don't
like a certain song but this is my true
opinion I'm not just a myth I love it I
love it I love it I love it to please
everyone so just can put that out there
that if you're looking for someone to
kiss at yours but I'm trying to make
this video but I'm also not going to
knock him because I don't normally let's
do a song anyway way too much talking
let's just get in with the first track
which is eraser I'm so excited
okay okay so what wait wait huh what
okay what is that you're rapping though
it sounded like so my country Jan you
listen to in like the backwoods of
Ireland and spinach are like rapping and
like really exciting okay sorry well
okay it signifies keep on keep on would
envy when they should be super crying
okay don't be jokin living for just like
talk saying rap kind of thing that he's
doing cuz usually I'm it's like we're
doing to anyone use like colloquial
language in song hook I hope you were
like Instagram likes like I hate one of
these labels like that because it makes
it not really relatable and kind of
cheesy but the worst he's using in a way
make it very intelligently written and
living hold up this is 59 seconds it
finally got so I guess this is the
chorus I think it's a great beat drop
but it just came like no I used to sing
nothing okay next is Capitol Hill which
I do remember being released as a single
on shape of you I didn't listen to this
one that I'm aware of
so yes here okay okay I literally have
chills
still I might have gone a lot Wow next
dive oh wait wait what what I wonder
what the song's gonna do op shit kind of
like dangerous woman beginning but like
Ed Sheeran Doug ah okay do not have to
give my own jump in it don't call me
[Laughter]
a little riff I see you take with you
like I first saw mr. Dayton around I was
like with your life my children and memo
pages where like you oh love this song
perfect okay
all of it sounds is trying to melt and
seem to sound the same after a while
they're all good but 11 is like knitted
you know I'm late for like so much EDM
this year this is a cop on track eight
and not what happened because if I did
say so I can't judge them for that but
you get I'm saying like I really like a
music with Sasha town's artist with a
lot of songs just start to blend
together after a while because they're
the same instruments and kind of like
lyric sounds so I don't know if I'm
going to live for this one
okay like let's see let's export of it
okay orchestration no not for me I would
never listen to this Galway girl go back
on their own boxes mother father baby
capacity for does it mean to speak
anything could you wrap it thanks for
your Irish dance means we gonna bat all
got a plug for your flippin right now be
me poor happier how us all that uh wait
a minute stomach down over both your
pops for twice as wide as on yes you
look happy
oh ah that hurt
I'm done cool
chill okay I've been judge that's all
the way too quickly I'm so sorry happier
so sorry into your new man so these five
on a pile oh the new guy
what did it you're in just say ok when
you rewind that distract you where
seagrasses indoors in winter at
nighttime in every town come on this is
a fob parts don't break around here she
is the sweetest thing lit on the urge to
spawn and next as I like and then it's
been like in a minute and I'm just like
what do I know
we could change okay this is the thing I
I know we trying to do it it's not I'm
not really here for it how would you
feel weird enough off cock it's also
like enticed me by a minute I do the
next one so like if someone thing you're
like walking out of like a hotel lobby
on the beach not my damn supermarket
flowers ooh love PA POTUS broke is a hot
- okay look up house down his
grandmother but like the husband's mom
is also alive - so his grandmother
passed away oh my God he's beautiful
whoa Barcelona okay good I mean it kind
of like song you hear like walking
through Epcot sorry I'm like moving the
thing is with like longmont albums like
this one 16 songs range is the deluxe
but you like I'm really into it first
like eight or so and then I get kind of
lost the end usually comes back but
there's a lot of pieces like there's
quite a song that's really high trying
to get through and there's some in the
middle and they don't see out much me
Vidia be yeah yeah cool
yeah I didn't say that okay often my
mother's proud of me for me Garfunkel
and he's great upon money and don't look
back at feminine talk I like feeling
possible absent a little vibe we've done
suits the context in the model but I'm
just getting tired of it like is it just
me I'm like there's no way that we're
boss and I was like they're all kind of
sounding the same I mean you look edge
here and break let me ask you Mulligan
see okay sounds just like tropical Irish
music which I like but they're all
sounding like those three gorgeous woman
ah look the last chocolate deluxe 16
save myself I'll give all my oxygen to
people love free no okay I can get it
down so I just know oh yes
drown it with the trash can out today
function oh I like that last song I
wanted to get in so they could have done
like a big orchestration like break in
the middle of it by not going to knock
it I do like it definitely give it a
