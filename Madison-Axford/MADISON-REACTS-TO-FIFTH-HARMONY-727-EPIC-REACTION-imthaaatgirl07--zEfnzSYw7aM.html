wanna do this job I already know what
you said hey guys so today I'm doing a
reaction video right okay to fit our
retail book 727 I it just came out so
yes that is my move today um I hope you
enjoy this I'm simpler than all snippets
from each song off the album if I can
find them all a prize do it off Spotify
that seems like the easy what is
happening with my hair let's fix this
also I'm so short
okay um but yes that's why would I will
do um just to not get caught in stuffs
we want the whole thing but I'll try to
listen to as much as I can I really do
I'm just too excited let's get started
oh and before I start I do not like this
is like my favorite people ever like I
listen them all the time so if I just
don't like one song it's just one song I
don't get all mad me like I support them
through anything like I am like the
biggest with our new baby girl I say
sing to them like every day of my life
kind of pathetic and weird but I love
them so if I just don't like one songs
just my personal preference doesn't mean
I don't like them we all know that this
is all cuz how many love right here okay
so it's the starting that's my girl
they kind of have the same like trumpet
kind of war fit sound again I think they
realize that that song took all so stick
with that sound okay oh oh
Beecher Oh boom what
okay I'm really living next is work from
home I think we went over there the
songs freaking amazing
yeah anyway um nothing
I am Anna data putting them hours imma
make it hotter
Oh days on the night shifts are acting
longer Steffi is 90 so long oh okay we
all know that's what sounds like so I'm
moving on to the life which I did here
on prior because it came out as a single
earlier in May this song the lyrics are
basic as hell but I live you know it's
like this intellect I've got this is the
time lag like this is the label say but
I love this let's go go
come on Ellie yes haha don't with in
other words here we go come on girls
yes just happy music I love it it just
makes me smile what what let's go yes ha
after that yeah I love that song
ok the next song also single earlier
like once so I don't I don't know it's a
grad on me yeah right on me but I don't
know really listen to it so let's listen
to the guys that's so excited it's so
much slower like I know it gets faster
but like the beginning I was just like
what is some ballad what's happening you
got the pain
yes come on no money she's gotten so
much better because I always like
consider her not as great at bogles as
the other girls like shoes best dancer
for sure but like I don't know so many
other people had such good soulful
voices and like she's come so far like
she is up there now like she never
messes up like her voice is slayed now
okay any one thing right on me sounds
like ride on me like our IDE when I
first heard that I was like one other
dirty song but it's right hey sounds
country though yes next I lied so let's
go
oh okay
yes I'm living for this already okay
fifth track and love yes Oh what I love
it come on come on let's go feed Rob
huh
look then we'll just see me die I'm dead
deceased deceased recipes okay next is
on my head flex with Fetty WAP and like
I heard this like a huge song like I
don't know if Sony single or what I
don't know I'm gonna like it but that's
my preference so let's just see
I do like Fetty WAP but like I don't
know if he'll like this song
I love how to stick to voices like no
matter what song you tell that's Fetty
WAPs part this was kind of boring I'm
not a huge fan I'm sad I like this one
this is just boring me and this is the
thing I really hope they don't lose out
on songs like I lied and like stuff like
that
he's if he's gonna be like another going
nowhere where it's an incredible song
rate be dropped great like lyrically but
then they don't promote it as much they
promote one side of him like okay
they're good but I wouldn't let cheese
listen him all the time like I was I
lied are going nowhere so I don't really
like that one I'm sorry I'm sorry like I
liked all them so far that was just kind
of like legs and now next one squeeze
this is slow is it slow what is
happening
it's inappropriate what squeeze orange
to squeeze like a hug please mean please
what's this meeting about the hook let's
talk about how my ass

ducking Gemma to this as much the other
ones next gonna get better let's started
