up second song ever I am living for this
hit or miss I want to start off by
saying that I reacted to Jacob many
times before and I do not um dislike him
as a person at all I just want to like
let you know that because everyone seems
to think that if I say something out a
song I mean if we don't like a human
being who created this song which is not
entirely true
by any means so I'm going to a song hit
or miss not Jacob as a person so with
that being said let's hop in the video
hit or miss reaction kind of nervous I
hope it's good scat I think I think I
mean better than sweatshirt I don't know
that because sweatshirt as annoying as
 as it was was pretty catchy way I
supposed to just seconds is that not
sound like modak ustedes nice mess
lengthy sex a melody not hating but
that's all I thought about when I just
heard that okay oh let's not worry about
some
wait okay what Jacob what sounds like
you grew up 17 years between sweat row
and this I like actually like this the
course is like bomb and I'm living for
the beat okay this isn't it bad so far
like new job Jacob good stuff of oh they
go up though maybe we see what it do he
raps now - what what what are you doing
Jacob though who next Leske who is
that
where do we come wait he just like hops
it come back they didn't open a door who
was that whoa Jacobs face where'd he go
where'd you go sorry only one who is
this guy like he's just there to wear
suit and take selfies I what huh
work from home anyone please randomly
gets it now like no ideas for the music
video let's get in and out sitting in
Jeep what's happening sit down it's not
car safety no seat belt Seba you should
even be in the front you are not around
about this song like I would James's in
my bar josée the music video though is
kind of making me carsick I don't know
if little the other guys is pissing
me off it's not you missing videos
Jacobs peridot we I can whip to this ok
nay they thought about this song I'd say
overall it was a hit this music video
lyric video whatever thing was kind of a
miss I don't know if that's his music
video for it cuz it's labeled lyric
video but it was a full music video I
mean it wasn't like sweatshirt but like
it was I'm doing stuff you should lyric
videos simply just lyrics so me said oh
I'm not a fan of I think it's definitely
stepped up since sweatshirt no doubt
about it sweatshirt was like I don't
even know like second grade compared to
this like this was a step up I didn't
like music video concept you just in
doubt the vegan fans are not gonna be
happy about that
yes that was a pretty good song good job
take a big step up if you're not ready
to i'm subscribe mention how it means
the world to me and i post new videos
every week and I'll see you guys later
