Thomas's selfie I guess it's a song or
music video I'm absolutely no idea this
is I'm going to do a little research on
him his age what he does how I see him
as stuff before I get started excited I
haven't even seen a picture of him I
guess I'll just look up on like famous
birthdays or something duh it's mark 15
years old okay so a little fetus again
you now an Instagram sensation who
publishes musically okay so you're
famous love you now
musically you're famous on Instagram I'm
dead the dislike bar say no okay I don't
understand what's happening why is this
Beach literally only occupied by ten
year olds what 15 years oh my god sorry
he does not look the teen though come on
he's 12 ah
ah right she's not happy she's like what
fingers in your hair the way we kiss
did he just ask for new it's like Loki
though this should not no no mark no you
seem like a nice kid go to your geometry
homework do not do this this is
inappropriate this is not ready for what
literally ready for what what are you
gonna do okay said she oh she looks like
is the girl today and remember this it
came after Friday it's like my jeans or
something she's like Kiki Pomeranz
player in my jeans anyone remember that
there was a great song loved it
live it I gotta find that girl Jenna
Rose yeah that's her this girl this girl
this is who we say much how's this video
I'm sure usually why are the inner
scream comes with the spoon
I've been getting chills because I was
so uncomfortable right now okay so he's
talking about like he's gonna show his
homies and like I hit your pretty lips
here and an angle with angel okay I'm
sorry
Jacob that I ever said anything bad
about you because your songs were
appropriate at least so we're a little
sweatshirt you know a little hit or miss
this it's just like so inappropriate I
feel so uncomfortable like yeah the 15
girls can kiss they can hang out
whatever but like take it from a right
angle like sexy I just feel like it's so
weird and like inappropriate coming from
such a young kid is that I don't think
this is a song here and like justice
you'd be like shopping for like justice
shirts then you're like I'll be foaming
anyones down dude is wink did he just
wink okay what though like some weird
selfie at the end okay thoughts about
this the song was okay it wasn't the
worst song I've ever heard I prefer
Jacob songs over this to be honest I was
really caught off guard I thought it's
gonna be like like Southie like some
weird cheery song I mean I'm glad he's
having success with that um I hope sure
he's a nice person I just was a little
caught off guard and don't maybe it's
cause like the people I grow up with in
the time I grew up and like we didn't
say this stuff maybe that's what's cool
now but anyway I can already give me a
big thumbs up and subscribe my channel
helps me out a lot and thank you guys so
much for watching and I'll see you later
in my next video bye
you
sissy that Wow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
