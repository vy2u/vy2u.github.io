reacting to the Cincinnati Zoo killing
the gorilla to say the boy who fell in
blah blah um I've heard tons about this
I've not seen the actual clip I've seen
like snapshot pictures images of it but
I've not seen it in motion or clips ever
scared I was not gruesome or anything
why no the guerrilla was killed in order
to see the boy and the boy just had a
concussion and some minor scrapes or
something from whatever the gorilla did
to him I don't know that much of the
backstory and I don't want to put blame
on either parties but I don't understand
how the boy fell into a gorilla
enclosure like I read the article and I
was like he had to climb over bushes and
brush and trees to get to this so it
wasn't just like oh he fell foot and
then like got in so I don't and then it
was like the kid had said previously
that he's like I'm I go in a gorilla pit
like this brat like come on like I'm
glad he's okay I didn't die you know but
the gorilla was murdered basically by
new people so that this boy or because
this boy hopped in the gorilla I don't
know if he really fell I wouldn't
classify it as falling when he chose to
walk in and when does he see the gorilla
that just pisses me off what the
are the parents doing honestly this
pisses me off so much like do I have
kids no and I got have kids for 10 years
most likely not not gonna work they're
going what if I got ready okay you know
like I know that my mom always had an
eye on me that I was not being a bright
I was not ever side so I don't know how
this could just be like peace at like
with a flick as the parents doing like
having sex on the side I don't
understand how they're not like watching
this kid and I don't want to be
judgmental but at the same time this is
broadcasted on every news channel for
the past five days and I don't
understand how this could happen so
we're gonna watch this clip I'm plugging
it fired I'm pissed and I'm not a huge
animal lover either I would never want
you know harm on to animals no no no
that's not me I would never want to see
animals being hurt but I'm not huge
animal ver like I'm not like I got cats
and dogs it's just not me so for me be
sighting almost when animals very
surprising but like gorillas wouldn't it
do before I start I just want to give a
quick shout out I never took my
Instagram DMS ever never ever chick -
scram dance okay I get a lot I think as
I was scrolling through them recently
because I am doing like I'm trying to
create merch I need someone to draw
like viola goes on on I'm looking
Suzette and I never checked them and I
like wish I would have and I feel like
God made me check the mystery to see
this message honestly whether or not you
believe in God that I believe that and I
believe in God and I was looking at my
messages and I saw one that mentioned
cancer and I was like oh no no no like
either this is fake or it's I'm very sad
because you know a lot of times people
will try to get to you and talk to you
with a fake story and that's just awful
but this wasn't fake and I just want to
give a shout out to Michelle who is a
beautiful beautiful mom of two beautiful
boys Jake and Blake Blake is currently
he has cancer and he's three years old
and it's just heartbreaking and she
mentioned how I watched my videos makes
her day my positive attitude makes her
day and like how she like looks watch my
videos and that means the entire world
to me and I just feel like almost self
assuring their story because she's going
through so much um
so much at such a young age that it's
just not fair and I realized that I was
taking so much in my own life for
granted no I'm not a mom no I I don't
have cancer
knock on wood you know but I mean like
today I was like oh my I shadow and like
I said I was like uh my shadow won't
blend and that just is so miniscule in
the grand scheme of things and she
really opened my eyes to realizing that
life is short and you never know how
strong it to be until you have to be
strong it's your only option and she is
just such a beautiful human being
definitely for me Instagram she's right
here to keep track of updates of her and
her son um well both her sons but Blake
who was going through treatment and just
pray for them that's what I'm doing
that's all you really can do and I
definitely wanna stay in touch with her
like she's so sweet I just talked to her
yesterday and she's just so kind and
she's so like thankful for me and I'm
like girl no like thank you for opening
my eyes thank you for sharing your story
thank you for being so strong in a role
model and a great mom and I just want to
give a shout out I hope you're feeling
okay Blake I know you're going through a
rough time you're being so strong and
you're incredible you know a role model
to all little you know young kids going
through cancer and just young kids in
general so thank you guys so much for
listening to that and Thank You Michelle
for reaching out to me you're one in a
million
thank you so much guys and I hope you're
feeling better Blake's do strong
beautiful but anyway let's get started
with the future presentation it's the
boy I think the boy is ready in there
cuz I'm not just gonna see him like fall
in
oh yeah he's behind the gorilla the
people screaming somebody called the zoo
okay so the gorillas tech is protecting
the boy oh sure I knew it was gonna oh
my god
that gorillas butt is huge I knew it was
gonna pull it at NU okay but it's on
water it's on a concrete so the boy just
was like I'm gonna ride the gorilla
looks like it's honestly just like kind
of keeping it Trek do gorillas watching
the kid better than the parents did uh
my son Ellen to do what look it doesn't
look like it's doing anything to it it's
literally like protecting it it looks
like it's like has his arm around it
look it's like patting it in while he's
but the kids like trying to get away
Oh God oh were they going what we's
doing so fast it's like Rydia over there
hayley segar like wished it was it took
him all he's doing that was dragging him
through water so it's not like he's like
beating him up or like molesting him or
like mauling him it's not like he's like
ripping his head off he's just kind of
dragging through the water probably to
protect him that is freaking crazy as
people screaming or by scaring the
gorilla the gorilla doesn't look like
it's gonna harm it yes I was going to
happen there okay so just kind of
sitting behind the cliff
shei could you imagine though if you
were just like in front of a 40 pound
gorilla I'd be scared to death did
something else happen because the
gorilla should not have been held over
that
what is this filming let's film the
scenery of the tree and the gorilla
exhibit
what is this filming like I know you
can't see it but then turn it off is
that literally all that happens this
video we've got 9 million views already
that's it right
caught on camera a scene that could
leave any parent paralyzed with fear a
little boy trapped with a gorilla but
it's not like lifting to thee no he
didn't slip into the enclosure he walked
there purposely she wanted to be in
agonizing minutes that followed they
shot and killed the western lowland
gorilla which is an endangered why could
you not given it like a tranquilizer
it's time to put it to sleep why'd you
to kill the gorilla there's so many
other options that could have been done
to put it to sleep or knock it out Frank
an allergy like I don't understand why
killing it this beautiful animal was the
only thing that they could have done
really really though in an instant panic
and I don't like animals and this is
pissing me off it's not okay behind this
400-pound ghoul what is he charging for
that like oh that's not okay is up
against the wall the boys not enough
against the wall retaining and being a
mom
protecting obsidian to Chinaman he
replied mr. Maddock excuse Casto mom's
writing everyone the were you ten
minutes earlier on Bay made a move that
frightened everyone watching dragging
the boy by the leg through the water
witness and I know I'm not there so I
would been scared they're infused hair
and I'm sure plugins why were you doing
this did the reason that this never
happens because pants really watch
they're ending on the edge if he thought
we were coming in zoo managers say they
had no choice but to kill Harambee using
a rifle the boy was taken to a
Children's Hospital with non-life
threatening injuries sad day all the way
around life-threatening injuries the
right choice is made it was difficult
he's not supposed to be pet like it's
obviously he's kept it down there and in
a closure because they're not the most
safe and most they are dangerous and can
leave dangerous lifestyles if you try to
attack never come near them but they're
beautiful
oh this pissed me off that's why I have
to say that I'm done I feel so bad for
that gorilla mm-hmm no anyway if you
like this video please give it a thumbs
up I know it's very controversial topic
but it just angers me because so much
more had been done I feel like and I'm
glad nothing after the kid and I'm glad
he's safe but like where the parents
that'll be like a lifelong question for
the rest of this generation find out
where the parents of the gorilla boy or
during this time and we've not made you
want to subscribe to my channel become a
first gonna do you like
