don't even know okay so I was usually
anxious on my room right and I have
these stupid-ass box lights I just got a
ring light thank the lord in heaven
because i had a stupid box light and one
fell over and the civil angle broke
leaking North Korean so I am currently
in a different room like a freaking
evacuated that room for about a week um
like we cleaned it up and everything but
I was never in for a long time I didn't
even realize like with a broken I
touched the light bulb so I think I'm
still alive right I could have died um
so yeah I'm still using a fucking box
light but I'm in a different room so
hopefully I won't be a pleasant reading
again I'm walking as Esther I break
everything but hopefully like this setup
I'm doing what I loved and during the
last one and you guys seem to really
like it and you had tons of requests for
me which I'm so honored thank you so
much for you actually want to see me do
more reaction videos would react oh yes
um so I'm gonna do you know quite a
little hot chunk of them and hopefully
enjoyed them if you don't like them to
skip on and more beauty and fashion
videos fashion win fucked or your
fashion video okay more beauty and
lifestyle videos will be coming soon and
they'll be thrown in throughout these
but I'd went to some reaction like I
said before which are my favorite kind
of videos to do um like to watch I may
not to do because I only good one but
like to watch I'll always want you to my
see any reaction someone I like I'll
watch that and I'm just like yeah I
think they're so funny it has to be a
funny person I don't think I'm funny but
thank you for some of you thought it was
funny that means a lot to me because I'm
just obviously reacting I've never seen
these videos before that I'm going to
react to or I wouldn't do it that's just
like dishonest and awkward so yesterday
I'm doing musically cringe compilation
is
Quest's estimate of Sartorius video and
thank you so I didn't know what
musically was I downloaded it I didn't
do any of it but I don't wanted to see
what it was Vegas is like lip-synching
songs okay sounds easy and fun enough
and so this is the cringe compilation so
I'm hoping these are really odd because
what is it low awkward people dancing so
I put my headphones on and we're going
to watch this together and react so
thank you for watching and subscribe you
can evade my channel I've got any videos
every week and let's get started the
others join this maybe this is fate like
I feel like not just watching this okay
bye laughing oh this mobile people wait
wait sorry once again was that a guy or
girl like I'm totally out trying to
discriminate but I couldn't tell if the
Puma person it was a guy or a girl cuz
looks like they're singing to each other
and I thought I was a girl person I'm
confused
these aren't cringe-worthy these are
cute these little kids are jamming is
that a guy no I think it's a girl wait
your talk with musically are you by my
side oh I was talking with it are just a
celeb stick
Oh cry oh she's like and there's like
the cross hanging around her neck you
know Christian bang
oh no oh yes hunger to the good old days
my mother sang boy to the ball yeah
capture ride my pony my saddles waiting
come she try not tried I don't I come
back time to the good old days
kiss her tongue ski ski ski water Oh
I was like where are these parents on
the money order bingo like that was just
cute oh so that's why I quit early it is
during that like the hood
I quit his parents walked in he was like
mom yeah putting instead of it like I
just like these kids so I can't
what are you doing what
spare light or three inside the country

scream what if she said that goes to my
enemies yes'm do you good citizens
become be honest

pussy

babe oh my I made a paper light right
