calm down okay you're up Jacob SAS way
too far and it's fine you know he
doesn't know who you are

can talk about him good man I don't
think anything negative about him what
bothers me is the part of his Twitter
and his again so sexy but he's not
because he's 13 and so it's worth about
to me and makes me uncomfortable I think
I think its actions are just very almost
douche like and I just think he need to
be careful and stuff but he doesn't know
how to get them used in that money he's
freaking armies coming at me and wanting
to burn down my house and I'm sorry um
but I don't have a problem with him I
just didn't think that song was good and
if you think that song is good that's
fine but you also might need hearing
aids we are going to watch his musically
freaking compilation because all I heard
