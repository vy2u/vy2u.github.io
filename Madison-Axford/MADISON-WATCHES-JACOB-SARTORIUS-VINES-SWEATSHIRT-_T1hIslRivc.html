that's out of the ordinary for me it's
like a reacting video or my opinion on
something that I've never seen before
and I wanna start doing these I'm not
going to friggin reacting channel but
like I want to react to these because my
favorite videos watching YouTube are
reaction videos I think they're
hilarious and so I was like I blush
these things why can I react to them as
well cuz what the fuck do I look like
I'm one foot tall totally that's what
I'm doing today and when I'm very
excited to do and I was requested well
by my friend to do a reaction to Jacob
Sartorius I think his name is Sartorius
Sartorius Sartorius his new song it's
like I saw on Twitter it's like charting
like number 10 on iTunes in the u.s.
overall like he's like killing it with
Beyonce and dragon shit so I've never
heard of this kid I don't know how old
he is I don't know what he looks like
um where he's from anything so I'm
excited to delve into the world of Jacob
Sartorius today okay like this video if
you have um heard of Jacobson hers
before I lived in her heard of him and I
feel bad but um I'm excited here this
song I love music so um I'll be excited
see it's gonna be making it onto my
Spotify playlist spot foam in Spotify

next round Spotify but um yeah I'm very
sad to react to this and maybe hopefully
do more reactions um soon so covered
employing music in YouTube channels any

do them so I just gonna put my hands on
here now and look like mug it and look
and watch Jacob sartorius's new song or
listen to it so let's go here we go what
is it sweatshirt is that a song I think
this I could refer his t-shirt or
sweatshirt yes way to Iowa hot a hug
what is he 500 does he because he looks
like he's like 10 so I'm hoping you know
I'll music today's inappropriate so I'm
hoping this like is it because he's like
10 so start okay
no make up with some sweatpants on you
know I can always be that guy
you can know about me all night long but
I think okay it's just like the size of
this I appreciate it when a guy attempts
to say the whole like chillin with no
makeup on hair tied sweatpants thing but
I really don't give a fuck whether or
not you like that about me I'm into some
however I want to dress up and you're
gonna like it so like I can like he's
already starting a song opener with like
a tweet from play 2013 like I can't do
more creative lyrically come on it's
fine it's fine it's fine I'll give him
another chance
I'm sorry take it let's try it that's
right I'm not hating I'm not hating but
forgettable as long as they're either
rights judge it so you we can be more
than just
the baby is more than wet testes do
litters and more the testes hold on
more than testes show you we can be more
than just oh wait test this oh okay
we'll be together Arkan yeah doing my
what instrument is in the back is what I
want no it's a yeah and like it's like
we're really annoying me I'm sorry okay
I can't it's like you know I don't know
what that sound is do do and not a want
baby
when you go to sleep at night when you
wake up in the morning and when you
walked off you know you won okay
ha so you're saying that she's going to
go to sleep in the sweatshirt wake up in
sweat shirt wear a sweatshirt school and
then go back to the sweatshirt like
bitch needs to get a new short okay cut
it's a nasty ass smelling sweatshirt
that's a High School Musical song do not
even try that
come right on show you exactly what I
wanna do is more than I can't look like
I can't with him being like 10 and this
song could be deemed or like could be
interpretive and so many like ways that
are any like inappropriate or sexual for
his age it's kind of uncomfortable baby
wait what does he say they're more than
teaches more than just this is not sound
like that baby it's not sound like more
than just this no you enunciate on
already somebody's
that instrument this is a dubstep remix
- baby what to do
like coils man on the track now hold on

sweatshirt dude wait wait what was that
that scared me
okay hold on me come on soon a shirt

his voice sounds like us have a girl the
whole thing and all of a sudden it's
like him with your puberty three times
it's now grown man if I was ham I can't
with these wigs it's like the same thing
like it sounds kind of like I'm not
being a hater but like Friday better
with a black head better lyrics in this
okay I need to like watch another video
this kid because like what is his deal
if I'm sorry I make sense now
Aaron Jung ko ko know how to hard-on
okay how does Cameron K 21 and then how
does this kid 13 so why is 7 8 years
older than Jacob hanging out with him I
just felt like so weird like that would
be like meeting that was an 11 year old
like Jacob and Kemp like I don't
understand that relationship maybe
that's just me but like I don't
understand that what was that
hold on hold on Jota Jota Jota what is
that well that's not touch one more time
I can't with this this you're 7 and you
can't be acting sexy already can do a
whole nice to do that be innocent now
watch Barney I can't with this kid he
like knows he's a good looking dirty
nose or whatever and he's a using a
truce advantage and I hate I hate people
like that like I hate me well know that
they're cute and they're gonna like put
it in people's faces like oh I don't
like that okay I don't understand how
these are funny but I'm sorry I don't
I'm not laughing at that I don't
understand how this is funny that's just
me though um but yes I've enjoyed me
reacting today of sartorius song which I
don't know how the hell is in the top
ten of my teen suicide and his vines I'm
sure he's a great person don't hate on
me for not liking his style I like him
as a person I'm sure I just don't think
