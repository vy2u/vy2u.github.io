musically compilation of Lauren Beach
I've heard a lot about how I need to
react to her but I've not heard about
her at all or who she is what she does
whatever so I guess she's given another
Jake up or something um I hope it's not
I don't know as awkward as those are to
watch but that part I do is hop right
into a Lauren Beach me speak up elation
I quote before I start I see her she
looks really pretty just about like 18
or so so um yeah that's what I'm going
to go in with the mindset thing you
she's 18
I'll look up her age I guess after I
watch a few or at the end um but yeah
the top region could be live dawn if I
had a dude I will pull it out and sit on
uh I'm shaky door wait it found a couple
of good quick what is so sexual set for
these goals it's a weapon so sexual she
was pretty and to make up her office and
her hair she look really pretty she's so
cute
the ladies are married great song so
Tess it
I like from her movement it's very light
strategically planned
it's very helped out
it's cool it's not always no no no too
much too much tongue licking teeth lip
stuff I need see I will choose poor
continue but she's going pretty and I
like her boo mix is very artistically
done for hey what up fans all my sister
is going 14 crawl now good for you that
confidence that sucks you amazing but
when you put your hair that like that
like um any young age what happens
fucker 14 I don't know I just like a 14
what I was doing without looking my lips
trying to be sexual I don't know what
making was and I thought being bad as
mixing my chocolate chips in with my
goldfish that's why you asked 14 watch
Disney Channel are they long fucking
Schoolhouse Rock them here in Glen Janet
so I props to you that you have your
makeup and you look like a sleigh Queen
but girl you look older than me and I'm
almost sweaty okay let's continue on
this is t1 this is good shit I mean 14
what does that mean to our new
generations in this world okay and
continue but I'm gonna judge harder
that's is 1400
her faces I was like I love this song no
look at her hair she do this cuz that's
Talent or cheer like a hair sauce is
like her musical hair stylist makeup
artists dead
see that's Talent that's good let's go
you are not in love you're 14 you're 30
probably other type of that I think I
need some robitussin why did she this

I be everywhere everybody known me
bracelet she looks like she's at least
19 I'm her musical a shirt I'm dead I'm
dead
she's really pretty um and like I said
like I think Jacob a like he's cute
they're little cute people but they're
so young it borderline it's immortal I'm
creepy and in a program was for anyone
to like watch them like I feel like
weird like watching them continuously
and being like yeah I get it because
they're so young and I mean I'm being my
polygraph to tell us or whatever but you
know there's like creepy old people like
all music leaving the can so it's weird
