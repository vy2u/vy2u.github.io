again waiting another video I'm home for
Spring Breaks I thought it'd be fun to
do you like some videos with her while
i'm home and i can film a lot well I'm
huh some doubt of college anyway today
we're doing on March favorites it's not
the end of March I get it but I didn't
do a februari favorite so I thought I'd
tweeze by very much other than together
and do a large favorite sauce called
that it's kinda like spring must-haves
things that are having for my life
recently and things that I've been
loving and um yeah we're doing some
clothing items makeup obviously and
music so have further ado let's get
started my first item are it aighty
brushes from Ulta but I have to they're
a little bit pricey but not too bad
compared to Mac or anything else I adore
these brushes i picked up this is the
first 1i got which works perfectly with
one of my other favorites but it's a
brush airbrush buffing foundation at
number 110 it's just flat top kabuki and
buffs this powder or foundation but I
used pad right now into my skin
perfectly and then this is my lid
beautifully it brush floss blush number
227 and it's just a nice explanted like
fluffy blush brush perfect for AB plying
blush my cheeks I love these brushes
there about twenty five to twenty seven
dollars i think at least these were um
and I yeah they're a bit pricey but I
love them I'm definitely gonna get more
than so so Oh high quality and I adore
these they're sold I think only an old
time maybe online but I know for alta
for yeah it brushes for all junk so I
love my first favorite is fairly traded
honey shampoo from lush this one's like
honey in it just makes your hair like
shiny and smooth and I just really like
it my next favorite is this tart blush
it's the darkest shade of blush they
have it's the Amazonian clay 12-hour
blush in the shade natural beauty it's a
beautiful deep dark red pinkish shade
color I don't put that much on because
it will overpower you especially with my
skin hangs red undertones ivory red
cheeks you can't see next time covered
up photo you show you the red cheeks and
so I want to put this on I put it on the
apples of my cheeks and very lightly
blend it out um you can't i'll hide it
too much this or
look classically but I do love this
color that this provides my second
favorite is the Naked 2 palette I don't
even have a tank about it and there the
nigga when a nigga three so go you i
don't know i thought i'd share that okay
it's your turn to shine all right i have
a lot of neutral of natural yeah had a
lot of natural colors in it which I like
so yeah these are the colors look like
my next favorite is my foundation that
i've been using recently which is
actually foundation powder it's actually
liquid it's just a nice powder that I
use with this brush this or ideal
together this is the mac studio fix
foundation better did you know max
standard for makeup artist cosmetics
yeah neither anyway this is in the shade
c5 yet if you don't for me moving on we
already established that it's a nice
yellow undertone no I don't have yellow
undertones but like I don't give a crap
I love doing this on my skin and says I
am Tanner now you can see that it
matches ok so it's not like I'm wipe
down here in like orange up here at all
kind of matches in the end I love this
it provides amazing coverage it covers
on my red cheeks like no other and eats
its or blemishes that I have yeah so my
shade is c5 but you can get what
everyone i reckons to anyone i have two
of these you guys for your Christmas I
whatever day I love it what my third
favorite is this tarp concealer I think
it works really good it's just kind of a
natural color it is in the shade light
medium beige and I got it from Sephora I
use it under my eyes and on any zits or
blemishes did I have so yeah my necks a
moment what ice cream any time you're
like oh my god okay my favorite is
something that I've had for like a few
Christmases are a few years now i got it
for a few Christmases ago it's my pink
beats pill by Nicki Minaj I love this
thing I never use excel's like a speaker
huh like i was doing but now i use this
all the time to listen music it is so
much more powerful than just your
computer or your phone speaker I'm three
chords in it this one like charged at my
computer and this one looks into your
phone so that's why I've chords going
everywhere but i love this is beautiful
if somebody four colors but this is the
nicki minaj one um because i love this

blares music like she so I was playing
too loud the other day jamming I was

and I don't know it just kind of feels
good to have it let me take it off mix
to your face you're really smooth and I
like it a lot it's like peel off so it's
easy to take off and they smell pretty
good I got them from target near preachy
through me like two dollars like okay my
last favorite is another scarf from moon
cats moon cat is one of my favorite
places to get scarves I had a brown
smooth that I wore earlier in my videos
and like December but this one is a new
crocheted one I love this one it's so
long it has these detailed little bowls
all along it and in french at the bottom
and yes it is spring but there are those
cold days in Missouri you know yeah
since when this comes in handy and look
it's huge and I love it I love it it's
so comfy and it just keeps me so more
and it's just cute and you can wear with
anything like a summer top yet I still
look a boss in my own eyes but I love it
so definitely check out moon cats famine

all the time okay all the time i wear
them my last favorite is the Maybelline
