where buzz on the side told you Dave
Reviva somebody's life signs how can
poach me when I say this chicken hey
guys today I'm doing a super fun really
montrose transformation for myself into
a blonde bombshell Marilyn Monroe so if
you want to see you like it the look
keep on watching so first I'm taking
that Paley Paint Pot I shadow primer and
putting this all over my eyelids get
ready flash oh look then I'm sending out
using creme brulee from makeup geek in a
real i'm laying the co tapered blending
brush and carving up my crease and using
a creme brulee s a transition color it
works amazing days as my first shade and
every eye look ever but yeah I just
caught of it out go from my crease outer
crease into the inner eye and yeah
that's the base color that I use for
this look it's not very a hard look it's
a white in the brown is what my tomorrow
did and the shoot and so that is what I
am replicating and this so I'm taking
Mac nylon I shadow which i love my
single eyeshadows they just lowered the
price to I think six or seven dollar so
nice to be more expensive and I'm I also
spray mac fix+ on this large i shadow
brush from oil and then you come and the
nylon I shall we say hi when I shadow
it's very very bright but something
about adding fix+ just makes it stick
into much more vibrant I'm taking my Kat
Von D tattoo liner in trooper and I'm
kind of winging it well I'm doing my
line on my Wayne's cat I could never
think is perfect but I was pretty happy
with her with her not in this video
later I will go in in my in my tight
line as well as water line I don't know
if I show the water line but both with
twentyforseven glide on eye liner
from urban decay in zero
then I'm going to take benefit they're
real black mascara in coat my lashes
before I apply my false lashes
I stuttered a new pair of Washington's
video test of lashes boudoir washes with
house of lashes lash glue I do prefer 20
blue I'm sorry the house of lashes is
just so very sticky and it stains
everything it gets on which is kind of
sucky but I didn't show this but I did
trim the lashes make sure when you start
a new pair of lashes you're trimming
them so they don't overpower your eye
moving under the face and taking my
Scandinavia primer spray my favorite bit
me Matt this is Matt no i think
this is doing sorry my dear foundation I
loved it me it's like five dollars from
a drugstore and I like this the
fundation I used to spit me when I would
use very dark tradition and I finally
match my skin tone and went back to fit
me because if you know my channel you
knew I was just a first a stick
foundation for a while but I moved back
to this with a beauty blender and I'm
loving it Sonia Messer conceal tried and
true concealer and I'm highlighting
really all my face after I can feel my
under eyes because you catch to your
otherwise you have to conceal everything
when you're doing concealer otherwise it
looks very uneven the very discolored
and off balanced I'm taking my macpro
emphasize powder and pressure that's
what that's called and put it under my
eyes to really highlight and brighten up
that area because I didn't notice this
foundation combined with the concealer
was a little yellow toned and putting a
little on the other spots I apply the
concealer like my forehead to chin and
nose taking laura mercier loose
translucent powder and again putting us
into my eyes because I find that I my
nose my eyes crease the most throughout
the day NYC bronzer is my favorite all
these products in the names will be
linked down below because I don't know
what shade this exactly is but I'm
taking my two-sided Kat Von D shade and
light face brush love at this brush and
just doing a simple contour I really
love the red and orange undertones in
NYC bronze there's three dollars girl
blush palette let in light taking the
more injured shadow putting on the APIs
my cheeks gonna get up to the contour
and then yeah what's the next step
what's the next step girl oh here we go
I didn't remember if I did this but yes
I am contouring the temples I'm a double
chin with
NYC once we got in that brush yes
demonstrate guy and then I am taking Mac
nylon I should have done using as the
highlighter on my cheekbones all right
allow this I show up a higher it's so
simple but yet beautiful it definitely
shows up when the Sun is hitting your
face taking I think this is just like an
essence red eye or lip liner I don't
really have any other read the plan that
i could find this is kind of pic
undertone to which sucks but you know we
made zoo and taking Ecotools brush with
some concealer and just lining my lips
or around where i line my lips because
it was a little wonky in some areas and
i noticed it wasn't precisely clean cut
as I wanted it to be and then I go in
with my Mac Ruby woo lipstick which is
just a perfect grab Mel immoral and it a
complete said look I don't think I've
showed it but I took that eyeliner
literally just around it is my heaven
teacher / and just dotted on my left
cheek area lower cheek middle Monroe's
famous mole you can create it with any
black brown eyeliner really liquid works
better because it's it sticks out more
on foundation and powder face but yeah
taking skinny gave a finish spray and
bam bam there's the mall there we go
I'll set I'm ready to go home and dress
