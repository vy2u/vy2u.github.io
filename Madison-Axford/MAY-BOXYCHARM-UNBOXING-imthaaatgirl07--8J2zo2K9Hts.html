with pencils or powders to seal and
protect brows from anyone to put a bus

brows coming unhinged that I love the

don't super love it I don't really wear
clothes like this but if I were to wear
this I'll have to fill my entire lip
because I don't have a lipstick to match
it

like a crayon actually I really like it

off-putting at first
it smells like FNV it last fragrance

smelling the same that's why and they
smell good it's just a little leg up
like it's very sweet so so sweet and
vanilla which is kind of off-putting
