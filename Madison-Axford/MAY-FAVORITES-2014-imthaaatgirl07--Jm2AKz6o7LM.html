favorites and I am NOT late this time
okay like maybe four days but not that
late if you think about it because
usually it's like middle month or I
don't do favorites video at all but you
know what I'm here today we're gonna
have a grand old time but it's over so
it's june sometime go into college in
two months holy balls hang without
further ado let's get started my first
favorite of the month is my favorite
favorite of a favorite to the month in
it loreal infallible eyeshadow in the
shade 892 amber rush I absolutely adore
this eyeshadow and never liked eyeshadow
before but this isn't this is more than
just like a powder eyeshadow this is
like a 24-hour staying on forever and
infinity and beyond eyeshadow and I love
this one oh my god just take a moment
for how beautiful this is I can't I
can't even I it's literally like I'm
putting gold on my eyelids I wear all
the time it's really cheap actually and
it lasts for a poor I put it on my
eyelid and under mat my inner corner I
love this stuff my second favorite is
hoola bronzer again I had this in last
month I have this in every video it's my
new favorite bronzer of all time I
splurged finally and got this and it's
such a matte bronzer just amazing it's
unlike anything I've ever had before
everything that Pat I said like sparkles
in it but this one has not and it's just
incredible it goes to the super amazing
cute brush which is like a small version
of an arse e to brush on this which is
amazing I just love this so much like
twenty eight thirty dollars i think at
Ulta or sephora and I just I just love
it I should do a contouring video if you
want a contouring video cup down below
and yes I mean I contoured all my other
makeup to roll so watch those if you
want to see
cubes makes me so so tan which is always
the look that I'm going for next we have
my extra large stones booster from
Lancome which is my eyelash primer I
love it I don't know what my lashes are
doing when I don't have this on them
first because this set yashas up for
perfection it separates that and it
makes some super long and voluminous
before you even put any muskers on a use
for mascaras after I use this and
malaysians are just bang it then we have
another loyal product in his aloria
mascara that I've rediscovered I had
this this my third time having this it
was one of the first mascaras I think I
ever really used and it's the voluminous
original just the original one in
blackest black I always get blackest
black in any makeup product just because
why would you just get black when you
can get blackest black so what it looks
like it's so plain but do not judge a
book by it's cover because this is one
of the most amazing mascaras ever my
last beauty product of the month is my
Anastasio anastacio Brad Wiz in ebony
because my eye brows are really really
dark if you couldn't tell they're
literally black obvious I have been
enjoying this for the most part I love
how there's a spoolie on one side works
very very well and then the brow pencil
on the other however this isn't quite
dark enough for me i really like it
though because if you're lying was like
like halfway up your face and you messed
up it's the most easiest thing to just
wipe off you don't even a makeup remover
or eye makeup remover you just literally
it kind of blends your finger is gone
and it's great so moving on to music
favorites of the month my favorite music
for the month has been pentatonix I've
known about them forever since they wore
on this thing off season for Buri but
i'll be getting everything they do I
just can't even okay so definitely check
come up you have in there totally
acapella groups they make amazing music
I don't know how it makes sounds they
make and how they do it they've been
around for a while and I just got all
the music on my phone they're medleys
especially are my favorites and I just I
love them I'm literally obsessed it's
crazy fan growing over pentatonix yeah
