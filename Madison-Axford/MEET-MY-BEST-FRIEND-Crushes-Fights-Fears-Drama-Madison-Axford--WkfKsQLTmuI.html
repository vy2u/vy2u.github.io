at the camera it's hard to look at that
when you're right there I like how good
we look the center we're living why have
like so much hair hey guys so today I am
here with mochi my best friend isn't so
long to try to get her on a video to try
to just even hang out our summers have
been like not wanting to work together
their schedules but we finally are here
so today we're doing the best friend tag
and you know it's just ratchet old and
irrelevant like no one knows anyone yeah
the further ado let's get started hat
and when did you meet you watching this
so I had to take this like really
ratchet weather clothes because I don't
want take chemistry biology because
across a m-- and so I walk into my
weather class the first day and I knew
someone in there so I like sat by her
but then the second day I walked in and
I saw this little bun in the corner in
the backseat closes through the door I
see a little fun and I was like who is
that and then I was like are you a
Madison X but even she was like because
she didn't say anything but she wasn't
like I know you're you two were like you
shouldn't really say it's usually my
snacks right and like automatically of
course I kind of assumed this from
YouTube or something and I was just like
yes like someone's talking to me it's
the first day oh my god please sit by me
like I had my bag so I on the table
because I was like I don't anyone go to
his class and then the leave the teacher
didn't speak English at all basically
I'm sorry but he couldn't so we were
just kind of like like making jokes
together like I'm what is this class
we're gonna suck at this
by the end of it the professor but
actually like yell of us in front of
everyone or life throws everything that
you guys need to stop talking but day we
did we know basically me though I feel
like I was like a lot like you you were
good at like being quiet I was like
money like during the class and he's
like feel like he would come in and we'd
be sitting in the back and he did you
guys don't talk to her and that was in
last August so we've imposed to me to
the fresh air that's crazy whoa question
two what's one favorite memory together
I have one I have work okay so we would
go we would have dinner nights when we
were first like not that good friends it
would like not
in our rooms but hang out in lecture
halls they're like oh yes so what time I
recently got acquainted with pickle mins
and she loves bickleman right so we went
to pickle man I got a whole pizza we
went into this ratchets lecture hall
that I didn't like at first she liked it
right and then became her favorite yeah
and then we just felt it out singing and
she got on this like long gap thing and
she was like walk around I know so that
was one of my - cuz I that was the night
where I say we say that good for you and
that's your anthem like all this crap
and we were just like well that's a good
one right now oh I wasn't talking about
that I'm not gonna use this one but I'll
explain it it was so fun we went to this
huge lecture hall like an auditorium
there's a stage basically and we're
standing on it like across to each other
and we spent like at least two hours
maybe singing naturally be nice like oh
oh like the Lana Del Rey song know like
they nationally at some of America and
we were that I'd be like oh see can you
see and then she'd be like like we're
next wishing parts like for two hours
like if we were we didn't think I was
weird why don't I marry memory so this
is knowing my ought to here memory but
this is so cheesy
it was when is when we're in a breakout
room and I like I was going to like this
really rush in time and I started crying
and like she came over and like hikes me
and I was just like oh like it was what
I knew we were like best friend right
because I was like I never cried in
front of anyone and I felt like I could
like confide in her that much that I was
like what my favorite memories cause it
like solidified like our relationship
okay I know we're gonna be best friends
cuz like that awkward moment just
happened and like I never cry and I
never cry in front of people and like
we've both friend for each other and
that's like we're good something that
annoys you about the other person don't
I know exactly what it is about you oh
crap no yeah it's that you go to bed so
early and it pissed me off because I
stay up till 4:00 every night and show
good about it literally like a p.m. and
I'm like Ryan girl I can't not have you
there for like eight hours the night I
need to text you you're not awake and
I'm like I know if it's past like 11 or
so she probably won't respond I should
be asleep and I'll be like right but
then what's funny is that she'll text me
at night and I
vaudeville all texture in the morning
and she won't respond we're like always
texting each other when we know we won't
be fine but we love to tell them oh okay
maybe one thing is it's like a general
thing is how like she always give
someone a chance like I don't like that
yeah hi it's like it's really annoying
because like I'm the kind of person like
if someone does something to me I'm done
like I won't go back to them I won't let
you waste my time on them but then like
if she likes someone who I don't like
she like that Khomeni like you have to
like give them a chance you need to like
get over that and like I'm that like
person who has those like walls built up
that I went no yeah which I used to be
like I used to be like if you mess up
once I'm done with you but like now I
feel like I'd become more like let's
have everyone which isn't always the
best but I have that it's kind of naive
I've I've learned to love it because I
long because it has taught me that I
shouldn't shut people up so bad crew
takes longer to get ready this is a
really hard question
it's not it is me cuz I'm like doing
drag makeup everyday like I when I was
baking my face this way I was like
that's a picture by I forgot my time you
got mad what is that one time do you
remember where I thought you were mad at
me yeah yeah love that you know no cuz
you guys that you and that are so cute
but then you're like cream heavy and I
wasn't it
it was um I think it was during all like
the drama but hold on wait now I'm
forgetting yeah then you had told right
you sent her messages or something you
know like this is like making me a
medicine get mad at each other and like
I didn't answer right away and then you
likely have you met huh yeah and we were
really mad at everybody what the big
misunderstanding that so I find that cos
things that can be construed as like we
are kind of like not normal yeah yeah
what is our song we have so that is
either borderline or gold okay this was
a huge one right then we have deja boo'
Judas my dude do it like a dude yeah and
like perfect nightmare we're gonna hate
Mayer oh my god
borderline is just like the one that I
that's the one that it's like even more
that thing going over was with Jared
borderline was such a song that we
listen to every
time we're together yeah whether it was
with other people or not like that was
always on is I'm good always on name the
other ones crush my ever crushing on
someone that's the things like no I
don't like wasting my time you didn't
like anyone in my classes or anyone in
like our clubs yeah cuz I just don't
like anyone you've talked to guys right
it has been like what three but like
you're just gonna like they do something
in to be like invite you okay well she
has this enormous kidding wait literally
go through see how many you can remember
oh that was an obsession admit it we had
it but it still come so like oh oh
Scheffer his new love his name the guy
literally I was like Madison you need to
skip right over him and she was like
what is the other's biggest fear
literally no yours and I know yours do
yours to be like it just like cars in
general just like driving in cars like
planes for me is very slick Gary for her
and then getting robbed I mean it's
understandable to come just like where
we go to school it's like not the safest
area at all times so I feel like you're
so it's like not succeeding like I can't
look you're very like if it has to be
perfect and sometimes if something like
fault yours a little better not fail its
but you know like things not perfect you
get a little like not fearful but like
anxious you're like yeah this isn't
turning out my one employee because it's
very fresh yes well Madison's is puking
in public good thing to do together
literally just with each other and
like eat candy like what we'll do is we
don't have to like oh I like going to a
mall I like what I do you know it's just
like sitting like in her dorm room or in
my room or wherever we were and like we
were just like you can D like play music
and dance around I'm saying and be under
here do homework
we could literally sit there on our
computers doing homework not talking to
each other but still be happy happy
having fun without having to talk they
were excite enjoy each other's company
like knowing that she's there I'm just
doing oh honey look I don't take texts
like it's like like the company oh I
know I'm doing mine well be careful with
her to say here mine was when everyone
was turning against her it would be so
easy to just be like bye I'm done doing
stuff to who she is in her character
she's like I want to go in I want to
fight for what I want and for what's
mine you won your argument you know
people started to believe you want to
get people to like you with the guy
right everything fell into place because
you stuck to who you were and I was just
like I was in his friend I got she's
like yes I was so proud so we come so
far in such a long way and then for her
it might like the moment I was the
proudest was the day we were at our ishi
Asian you have to be determined and with
certain anxiety things it just gets
really hard so the moment that she got
her little pin I was like oh my god it
was the bumpiest yeah theists craziest
experience it wasn't like a normal
person because like I'm different
because I have YouTube because I'm
anxiety because I'm allowed Busan Allen
ep like people are confused by that a
lot and I've just created such a weird
environment that made it very hard but
like I said like I even like Chuck
myself like how determined I was to do
what was what I wanted to do when I set
out to you from the beginning well
that's what makes the other mad people
chew out it really because it's wrong
like she's like like even if I chill out
like fetching my chips should be like
I'm a putting headphones cuz you've been
really good mine I don't really will
when people are like really really
passive-aggressive or like sarcastic but
see it makes me that too it's like you
kind of her like oh but you were like
one thing that makes max I didn't know
oh I already know i straight-up know
it's when people stare oh he hates when
people stare because
and in a college campus literally all
people care about is looking ratchet or
having like no clothes on but like when
you dress up like she has dressed up
with her like high heels on and people
just stare and like oh I hate said like
not looking and then like people will be
sitting and someone will just be like
yes and then meat will look back we're
not scared like what are you ready now
