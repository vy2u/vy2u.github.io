or something that's more thick maybe try
a foundation it's for both luxury Hey
today I'm doing a very exciting video
it's a makeup tutorial but it is not on
me it's on my system at henze she's
gonna be in seventh grade next year and
it's a middle school makeup routine so
it's a very simplistic makeup tutorial
it's not a lot of steps and not a lot of
things we're not contouring Jonathan
eyebrows um doing eyeshadow no it's very
simple and what I believe if a young
little girls to get started makeup what
they might look into you don't do all
these steps this is even a little heavy
of a routine I think um but I want to
add all the steps if you maybe have bad
acne you want to cover it up or maybe
you just want to cover up redness or
blemishes or whatever it may be
or maybe you just want to get
experimental with lipstick and lip gloss
and mascara this is the video for you
I'm gonna shoot all the steps so I have
my little model here's my sister who's
12 years old without further ado let's
get started so the first thing we're
gonna start with is a baby lips it's
just a gentle lip moisturizer it's clear
it provides no color it just provides
moisture
I recommend this cuz who everyone is
maybelline instant age rewind dark
circle eraser concealing I just because
this is dark circle eraser an age rewind
doesn't mean you have to be older to use
this any age Ken because it doesn't have
like weird special formula in it it's
just the concealer and the fact that it
covers up very well so I'm covering up
her redness under her eyes a little
redness around the nose
and on the top of the note she's a minor
minor breakout I'm just going to lightly
tap this in and blend it put the booklet
footballs and you can use your middle
finger or your ring finger for this next
I'm taking a Beauty Blender sponge
because my favorite thing to apply
makeup with and her covergirl outlast if
I have a stain on foundation with SPF
and conceal an image don't resent me
this is because she has a very minor
breakout it's very small but instead of
using concealer I like to use foundation
this annoying means that if your melts
well you need to use foundation no that
doesn't tell what I'm saying but if you
are interested in using more makeup or
some of this more thick maybe try a
foundation I'm also not going to use as
much as I
normally applied because I do apply
quite a bit for my skin I'm just going
to put a dot on each cheek I go on the
forehead nose and since we are sisters
we both have a reddish nose put a little
extra around any redness with a
Beautyblender sponge I'm just lightly
dabbing it now if you want to add a
little more because this is just
basically for covering up any redness
but if you want to add a little
something extra always add a little
blush this one is from ELF
it's the shade candid coral and you
don't want a bright pink or anything you
just want a nice light or G Corley
salmony color and put it right above the
cheekbone just very lightly you don't
want to overdo this because you will
look like a clown okay so that's a nice
little color to the cheeks in case the
foundation like it do to her a bit
washed you out again whatever amount of
makeup uni applies middle score is
totally fine maybe you want more than
this and that's fine and if you want
less and that's totally completely and
utterly fine as well but this is just a
simple routine that I think everyone
could follow if you wanted to add makeup
the next thing I'm going to do is add a
little mess cards maybe a little
dramatic
maybe you wanna start with eyeliner like
I did I would look at my mascara
eyeliner though but whatever it's your
preference I just think this makes your
eyes pop a little more
so just few swipes of this add a little
color to lashes nothing come addict and
the last step is something that I
recommend everyone its lip gloss now if
you don't want to do any makeup I
suggest starting with a lip gloss like
for anything this adds a nice little
girly touch without going overboard and
if your parents are a little strict on
what makeup just see if you can use a
little lip gloss or maybe a concealer if
you have a breakout just put this on the
bottom lip and then blend in the top you
don't over deal with too much gloss
because that sucks to rub in you have
way too much so I hope you enjoyed this
makeup tutorial all of the products that
I used for this middle school makeup
look at my sister will be listed in the
down bar if you're wondering what
products be exactly used again I don't
want this to offend anyone if you are
middle school or if you're a parent or a
sibling of someone in middle school um
you're like well my sister my cousin or
my friend doesn't do this or wear that
you know it's totally fine they can do
whatever they want wear how much or how
little this is just a basis that I
started with so I want to do it on my
sisters usually wears something
this I just thought it'd be good to
share because a lot of my newer are
middle schoolers hello I love you all
and I decided to be going to show you
how to start out with makeup and how to
start out it's like a very fresh face
you don't want to do it or overpower it
when you're at a very young tender age
