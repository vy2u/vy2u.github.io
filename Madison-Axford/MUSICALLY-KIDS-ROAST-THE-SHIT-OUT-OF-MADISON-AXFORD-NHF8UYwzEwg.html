responding to musically hate video hate
comments video okay I'm not a huge user
a Buddhist for following me on there
light so it was an option for you to
follow me on any social media including
musically but musically is one that I
kind of joined what you laying I'm Way
too old but I try I try I think I
realizes I've never looked at comments
on my musically posts until recently and
they're awful and I'm just like holy
 I'm being like roasted in these
comments so let me roast some people
back
what are you where you be GE you what I
am weary BG is actually this dress from
style we I adore it and then this choker
that I recently got I'm not gonna
comment something mean cuz I have flaws
myself what I'm like all these kids
mainly girls I haven't seen on a guy
comments on my mainly girl little little
kids are commenting just vicious things
and I'm like okay you did a good job of
filling in your eyebrows I'm gonna take
this as a compliment because I don't
fill in my eyebrows so if I think they
look filled in and you think I did a
good job thank you so much even though I
know that was trying to drag me for my
natural thick brows you tried but you
failed
you're so in to your self your first
your spelt wrong it's not your so I
don't own a so it is you are so into is
one word and yourself is one word but
you split them up into two each make me
four words or so we've been too so like
girl if you're gonna try to come for me
saying I'm too conceited really maybe we
should focus on your grammar first
there are kids on this app really hey I
even know kids could use this app oh
wait no no no I did know that wait wait
hold up you complain about people being
cringe wait not being horrid I mean
you're amazing and everything but you're
being cringe right here is this a joke
or love you
what and this comment went through a 900
different emotion okay so she's saying
that I'm cringing and I shouldn't
complain about people being cringy and
then she sorry if she's being mean and
I'm amazing and she loves me but then
I'm totally being cringy but she loves
me
madisyn be your self on this app we both
know you don't act like so please be
your self oh I know that these little
kids and that they can't spell
apparently and don't go to school so we
don't learn sentence structure up at the
same time if you're on an app and you're
being responsible for your own account
your own profile you also need to
respond scible for your comments and
what you say to other people you don't
get pass for being rude and you don't
get a pass for being grammatically
incorrect in your comments so I'm going
to roast you for that and also this is
being myself
I've always fully 100% myself and I
never regret it so if you don't like me
being myself and you think that I'm
being someone else goodbye haha when you
think you're cute and try to be sexy
okay well I could say the same about
your profile picture though where's the
bleach you forgotten ' and your
publisher I just can't imagine being
like eight and being going on someone's
you know musically profile who's not
doing anything wrong just begin
themselves being weird and it being like
where is that bleach like obviously you
watch way too many videos on YouTube and
you've seen way too many comments and
think that you can just write it too but
it's inappropriate
hahahahahahaha thank you fella Lee are
you gonna be a Sloot I hotdogs for
Halloween nope wait for hella when up
WCF this is not vogue I'm so beautiful
oMG thank you oh crap almost out of time
let's show Mickey what does that even
mean what does that even mean this girl
again the cringe though hun just cuz you
spend one hour on your makeup everyday
doesn't mean it's beautiful who are you
today I'm talking about what is
beautiful
me or not what the hell okay if you're
gonna try to comment don't try to
comment in the Lipsey's and then do it
with commas it ruins the entire point of
what in ellipses is you calling these
kids crunchy but you're even worse
get off of musically hold upon a hold up
are you the musically police no she
hella extra space period that's actually
I'm like that's a compliment my friends
call me that and so thank you okay and
now we have a hate comment in Spanish
buttery so me that insignias must do
Cara gay Mickey Mouse
you said I'm conceited and then you said
I don't teach my face more than Mickey
Mouse makeup too thick and I brow and
gross face going with that makeup oh my
god I don't even know you know if you're
gay if you have a mean comment and it's
correct all the way through I'll give
you the props whatever good for you but
you can't come on here and read it so
wrong and expect to like feel like a
boss ass bitch Queen when you're just
embarrassing yourself
really it's embarrassing okay now we
have a common in German that's deshaun
in Michigan when I do vision and fango
Oh dick okay I say I'm not good at
German already boring and you're a bit
of a beginner you know what though I am
a beginner I will forever be a beginner
musically cuz I'm just not good at hand
eye movements to music I get a little
dizzy what the heck is this ah those are
probably fake with a am I gonna get
200 all bills that look realistic as
hell that's right the bank cuz they're
real you only got two hundred dollar
bills left because you spent it on that
Mac up it's a joke if people can't tell
that it's a joke without your writing
it's a joke that obviously means that
it's more mean than probably intended so
this was all the favor and just don't
comment anything she is a mother why was
she
okay apparently I'm a mother now and I
should download this app last time I
checked I have a never who is a child I
had my but thank you for trying to tell
me otherwise you should use that money
to fix the gap in your mom oh my god I
am dying I like literally dying at these
this person commented again you know
there is a make private button if your
musicals are to cringey wait then your
whole account would be private Oh burn
actually not but i'ma burn you okay so
all the time that you're using and
wasting on counting main things on my
account I'm using to do other things
like go to college get good grades get a
degree get a career make money off being
myself and are you making money off
doing this oh no you're not but I'm not
one to make you feel bad so keep trying
and also while you're at it read a
grammar or English book or two maybe
you'll learn a little bit and then try
to come talk to me because I'm what the
grammar queen so if you want to try to
talk to me talk to an English book first
she's black I mean that's not an insult
at all but like I went but what like I'm
so pale and then here we go
why are you so white we're done with
that I hope you enjoy pin all right

fierce come and develop me in the rest
of us on here and remember don't take
anyone's this isn't to make people
feel bad for me this isn't to get
sympathy this is into it we seem like oh
