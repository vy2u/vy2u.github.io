quick video which is my birthday
homemade birthday was yesterday August
17th and before I start well first of
all homes um it's a little far away
let's try this again ok so I mean just
like a pink Speer Jersey and it my hair
just kinda like drying and so I'm just
kind of ratchet today because it's a day
for my birthday and I don't want to get
you super super dressed up I just kind
of wanted to do this video for you and
get it up there so you could see what I
got before this video kind of becomes
too late and irrelevant so I am so so
blessed with not only my family and
friends but also you guys you guys who
wish me happy birthday thank you so much
it was so nice and I didn't think I'd
get that many but especially on I mean
Twitter Instagram Facebook snapchat like
everyone used all platforms but
especially Twitter there were so many
messages that so many create creative
like messages and pictures and edits and
everything and I'm just very thankful
for that and I'm also thinking for my
family and friends who sent me texts or
you know Facebook posts or my family who
got me presents is just so it's so fun
and so kind I'm so happy so I thought
I'd share with you if you're gonna say
that I'm bragging that's you know your
opinion I put a disclaimer on Twitter
before cuz I didn't think I was gonna do
this video I just didn't find it
necessary and I usually do a Christmas
haul and not a birthday just to avoid
unnecessary hate from people who think
I'm just doing this for attention or to
show off what I got I'm not I like
couldn't care less about doing this
video I just want to do it because I
personally like watching other people's
videos to see you know what I might want
to buy for myself or what I might want
to get for other people um in the future
but if I'm just doing this video cuz
hopefully I'll help you or maybe you'll
you like watching these I don't know I
just don't want people to think that I'm
bragging I'm not so with all that said
thank you again for all your kind of
wishes and thoughts I thought I had
lipstick on my teeth I was like hell no
um anyway without further ado let's get
started with the birthday haul so I
turned 19 this year yeah it was about
damn time so I was 18 for literally 18
years like oh my god it felt so long
then I was 18 and I was just like
it's about time my goodness anyway the
first thing I got is from my sister and
I ran out of foundation yesterday which
is my favorite covergirl three-in-one
classic phonation everyone uses it you
know it's the blue top pump and then she
surprised me whip this covergirl
foundation so I have a new fool and I
used two today it's my favorite it just
says wonders for a drugstore foundation
and yes she said that sun else was
coming in the mail so I'll keep you
updated but she didn't need to get me
anything but this is definitely enough
so I gotta finish it and I need this
it's practical I needed it so that's
always good anyway next presents are
from my mom and dad so let's get into
those the worst thing I got I took it
out of its like case bag thing because I
won't show you guys did not show it in a
bag but I used to wear my mom's pearl
necklace all the time because I didn't
have a pearl necklace and it's from Kate
Spade and this little bow connector and
I loved it and I was like oh my god I
want this I want to wear in every videos
but I went to my own and she I finally
got it so I'm so so thankful because I
wore hers all the freaking time it's
like a three strand of pearls necklace
and then it's connected my little gold
bow so it is from Kate Spade and sings
deck when she has you probably seen me
wear this before it was hers so now I
finally have my own yeah I love it it's
plays like that looks super preppy and
I'm really excited to wear this nice hi
guys whoops a st. Louis Billiken blue
hat I love baseball caps especially when
you're in college and your hair is not
doing that well and you just put a hat
on and you go to clients looking at
SuperDuper cute so I got that I love
this color and it's for college so yeah
it was kind of a joke but not really
because I'm obsessed with these kind of
underwears
they're like a high cut straight I don't
know if they sell these anymore when my
mom had these old package once a long
time ago when she bought them and she
never more than she was like here you go
and I was like oh my god they like cut
up if you can see this really high on
the side and I learned wear big t-shirt
and this like all day every day at my
house so I got a few colors and then
there's a light blue one that I got by
already Ward's yes I got five pairs of
underwear
I love getting underwear for Christmas
and birthdays in any type of holiday
like other words like my favor
yes like if you don't know to get me
give me any choice in your underwear or
get me these jockey hype at underwear
because I love underwear then I got this
Victoria's Secret pink like Nike dri-fit
shorts they're red and gray and for the
st. Louis Cardinals go Cardinals it's
just pink right there on the side back
and so I love these I wear these every
day in college as well and yes it's nice
to have another pair I don't have red
then I have some st. Louis vilkin blue
sweat pants I rarely wear sweat pants
but I found myself wearing them a lot of
college and I already haven't mentioned
the sweatshirt so I'll be totally
sweatpants sweat shirt did out when I'm
in this gear okay so I'm ready then I
got um I have this makeup kit okay so my
makeup collection this why don't you
make a punching video is because all my
makeup is just shoved in one bag I
didn't get this for my birthday I read
about this a long time ago but all my
makeup is in here this is every makeup
item that I do own and use or maybe not
use but have you know it's full to the
brim it's heavy but I don't have a
organization set up from a makeup I just
throw it in here and that's why I don't
do a makeup collection I can do one but
it's leather just throw in this bag
anyway this bag is going way too small
and unorganized so my mom decided to get
me a new one so she got me this Kate
Spade one and it's super adorable and if
these are very trendy in in and everyone
has one of these makeup bags mine has
lipstick swatches all over it which I
love since I'm like a beauty person um
and then you unzip it and it has a
compartment for you puts up here and
then it place for you to put things in
here like the extra travel bag that pops
out so it's really really cute and I
like it a lot so I'm excited that I got
a new updated cute kingsday one even
though it's for everyone I'm not gonna
get rid of it so very handy and good but
it's not so much cuter and then the last
two things I got our first is this purse
from Kate's but yeah I get kids mixed up
with all the time sorry like Christmas
was Kate's favorite days kids made um I
adore this purse I picked it out this
was the thing that I picked out that I
want it kind of looks like old lady
person far away but it's not it's so
cute look it's like this creamish color
has about by the long strap and then to
make shoulder strap it into our
jep's and I love this green print this
is like very in right now this is seen
everywhere in people's decor in their
room people's wallpaper everything is
this and I love this thing so much so I
should have waited to do what's in my
purse of this bag but I did it with my
Michael Kors bag if you haven't seen
that check that out I did it recently
but anyway so I got this what I wanted
and picked out so I love it and then my
mom also got me one last thing which
okay this I already had this and this is
the one I've been carrying around for
the past like two years and I love it
but I has a lot of dirt if you might not
in my heavy picking out but a lot of
dirt and gross like crud on it so now
I'm using this as a strict as strictly
just change like it's a nice place to
keep on my change because I have so much
and then she got me so because this
one's kind of torn up she got me a new
little wristlet wallet thing and it's
just this blue one from Kate Spade
Saturday it's a different brand in Kate
Spade so it's just this beautiful royal
blue has the Kate Spade Saturday logo
and in it I have all my cash and cards
and then on the back side I have my
cards on the outside here I'm covering
up so that is what I got for my birthday
