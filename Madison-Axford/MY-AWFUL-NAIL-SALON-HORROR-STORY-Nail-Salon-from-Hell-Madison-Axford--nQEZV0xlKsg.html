that's my nail or story like the nail
salon was completely okay so we can try
to make this as short as possible I know
people don't like videos where I'm like
complaining for an hour and a half at
the same time you clicked on a nail
horse right which is the person
complaining about their nail story
experience so that's what you're gonna
get a lot of stuff I feel like always
happens when I go I don't know how like
freaking people go every two weeks and
it like your nails feel it in because
every time I go I get pissed off about
something so yeah that's what I'm
talking about today I'm not one tooth or
nails done all the time because like it
can get expensive and they don't stay on
for me very long I do love my hands like
typing wise editing and stuff so I'm
very hard on them and I they don't stay
on as long as someone who does nothing
but you martinis by the pool so you know
what I mean it's like nails aren't
always the best thing for me because
they ways plop off very easily and soon
after I get up this happened to me last
summer so summer 2015 and I really
debated a long time about whether I
wanted to do this because I knew people
were gonna be like this is racist this
is no it's not yes those are the same
pretty much anywhere you go um with you
know who works there and this is not
racist this is my experience
that I had so if you have a problem with
I click off this video um I usually have
like I said like okay experiences
they're always a little weird I don't
know if it's the way I look or the way I
talk or act but it's like I encounter a
lot of people who are more rude than
others but I have had plenty of good
nail no manicure since that before so
this is just one incident let's get
started so first walked in there is like
a 35 minute wait not their fault you
know it's just a lot of customers so
that was just going to start with but
obviously it's none of their faults I
was just like already because I had to
wait so long which there's never wait
for this nail salon that I went to I
don't go there anymore and so I was like
where the hell am I like I should just
go to join cuz there's 90 nail salons
but no I was going to this once my
tried-and-true one I claim and so I was
just gonna stay there okay so once my
manicurist lady she looks like she was
around like thirty five ish comes over
me and she's like okay like you're next
and I was like okay awesome
and she's like what are you getting a
second I'm like I want a full set a full
set of acrylics they know what that
means
um and so then that's when they start on
in with you with like the gel thing like
okay see what the gel and I was like
which is supposed to like be some
special polish or whatever that makes
your nail push the now watch lasts
longer
special light her I don't even know
Excel get that and I was
like no I just want regular I always
want ready lurks I wanted to be cheaper
if you get regular paint is usually
twenty-five to thirty dollars should not
be more than that that is normal full
set acrylic paint French tips is a
little more gels a lot more so I always
just get regular Pink's I know it's
gonna be like I know they're gonna fall
off soon I know they're not gonna last
duper long and that's just me so I want
to get the cheapest I can wall miles
still look decent I don't want to look
the mill to crap but I don't want to
spend excess money on them they're gonna
fall off the same amount of time as
regular nails without gel you get that
you gotta I mean so I never do gel is
just not worth it to me so she like
argues me for an hour and a half
literally about this gel and she's like
well do you want like flowers or
something and I might know what no I
don't I don't
I'm not five-and-a-half I don't want
flowers on my fingers you know those
eggs detailing with jewels or whatever
to make designs and fingers like no
really I just wanted painted this like
blue color I think I was getting and
they were like okay like you can see
they're kind of getting annoyed and I'm
like I'm sorry but like I don't want gel
please just do what I came in here to
get like please do not keep forcing me
and pressuring me to get gel I don't
break easily I don't fall to you know
deals or your reasons why you get gel I
don't fall to peer pressure or
persuading easily by any means if at all
so you saying that gel is gonna be
prettier which is what they did and gels
gonna last longer it is not convincing
me so you can stop wasting your time
like they're like well it's pretty gels
prettier and I'm like hey tell it to the
next customer I don't want it that
happens at anything else wanna go do
your with the Rose try to sell you the
extra few bucks but I'm just like no so
we're sitting and like they start to
like pick up the nail slightly they
start to buff my nail like whatever just
look at my nails and why am i holding a
pen and they see my nails are extremely
short and bad like I don't fight them
some drawers but I picked them off when
I get nervous at picking them I pick the
cuticles the skin around them is
disgusting sorry to have it whatever I
know I needed quite a bit again and my
cuticles are all red they're not like
bloody but they're just red because of
irritation over the years and
and she's staring at them like blatantly
being like you want testing these and
I'm just like already feeling bad
because I know sometimes shorter nails
can be hard to work with but not with
acrylics or full set because you're
literally gluing a thick ass fake nail
is this long on top of the other ratchet
nail and nail bed so this is
disappearing you're gonna have a whole
beautiful new big ass long nail to work
with that's fake okay and so she's
looking at them especially when together
workers I guess they're like friends but
they were both part and she walks over
and no joke they like look at my nails
and like they said something obviously I
don't know what they're saying and they
start laughing like the other all
started laughing and I was like you've
got to be kidding me this is all in
control now like I already know my nails
are bad that's why I came in here to get
my nails done and get fake let's put on
so I know zero roaches he's not
attractive they're red irritated and
nasty so I don't need people to come
over and gawk at my nails is if it's a
show I'm sorry that they don't look
perfect or like yours but at the same
time just with the acrylics on
and we can move on so they were
literally like looking at my nails like
blatantly looking at my nails and
talking in different language I don't
really understand what they're saying
but by their expressions and their
laughter and their like eye contact I
could definitely tell that it was not
good they weren't like wow beautiful
nail beds obviously they were delicious
she's like saying something I like
putting right here and the one girl was
laughing I could bleed and the nail
salon anyways she walks away and I was
pissed like I was just like are you
literally kidding me she try to sell me
every freaking service we have now been
through gel we've been through a flower
design now she moves on to their waxing
okay and granted I didn't know how to
like get rid of a mustache or like a
unibrow at this time apparently I mean I
was like 18 but stupid and so now we're
all good okay
hairless at that time I was still kind
of young like Dan really know what was
happening it was a year ago I don't know
I was doing so there was probably like I
think I get I used to get my moustache
wax now I have a better way of getting
off but I used to get it waxed and um I
would pluck my eyebrows I would never
get anything really done except put my I
was right there I would never plucked
over here because I didn't want to mess
them up and so she's literally like um
upper lip
and I was like what like don't even go
there right now because I got it done
about three to five days earlier at a
different a salon I always went to for
like my lip waxing and I've dark hair a
freaking entire cast eyebrows and so
that's what happens when you have dark
hair you gotta get it taken care of and
I was and I don't know if like a little
nug of our head finger like little nub
had grown back and she's like yeah
mustache like you want to get like this
upper lip fix my wax my ever lived no
and she's like and I was like oh my god
like I'm literally being bullied no I
don't want to get my bro wet lip wax I
just paid $15 fee to wax like four days
ago so I don't need you to exit again
and then laugh at me with your friends
after I leave I came in here to get my
freakin full set of acrylics and that's
it and then she's like okay what about
eyebrow mmm I'm like no and she's like
you know you have nice shape but like
kind of like message or something she
said she was a hairy or messy I'll
remember the word but she said she's
like you're nice shape and I was like
yeah thank you she's like but dirt like
like chew that dudes enhance what
they're crazy okay I don't need you to
wax them and then them up okay
thank you wet note so basically she went
to wax my entire body and give me every
freaking service that they offered there
and I was just like no like I don't need
my eyebrows so she's putting their coats
on the acrylic processes literally two
hours on a good day it takes so long to
put a full set of new of critic acrylics
on your nails she's finally buffed them
all down glued them all on and one is
crooked
and I'm not talking about like Oh a
little like to the side off-center
because your fingers probably wonky no
it was my middle finger and it was like
jolting that way and I was like oh my
god should I tell her I don't want to
something good total bitch but like I'm
paying for these like twenty-five
dollars for this and I don't want to be
like hey guys and ones like don't you
know
so I was like 22 and I like and looking
like kind of like this so maybe she's
like oh is there something wrong and she
did and I was like what kind of look to
get rid of signage take what's wrong and
I was like this one's a little crooked
and this one's well it just doesn't look
like them and she's like it's fine
I'll fix it later like it's fine and I
was like oh okay yeah she wrote yes she
she really knows what she's doing like
she obviously she's not gonna have a
nail that's a 90 degree angle and think
that's okay and expect to get a good tip
because it looks very wrong but clearly
from across her to me see what the folks
that girl's middle fingernail doing is
she claims she was gonna have this
magical way to fix it so I'm just
chilling like okay that's awesome great
I have my color up but she like 90 more
colors on the table okay so mine's like
a blue and she like literally picks up a
taupe and paints my thumb and I wasn't
looking I was stupidly on my phone and I
put it down I was like what the
just happened I was like I wanted the
blue color like I didn't want to be a
bitch again but I was like you've made
the color I gave you I really okay this
is the thing I know I probably sound
like a bitch but I'm really not trying
to it was a very hard session to get
through without getting pissed off she
was getting on my last nerve and it gets
worse I work in the service industry for
four years and I know that the customers
can be shitty and rude and awful and I
never go into a place deliberately gonna
be a bitch gonna be rude but when
someone's rude to me and when someone
gives weird vibe or is not helpful or
kind that's when things stray a little
from what was planned sorry I don't want
the table that's not what I asked for it
she was like like it was my fault like
she isn't wrong and I felt like I had to
apologize for I was like I'm so sorry
but like that's the wrong color like I
felt like I was gonna do yelled at if I
like said too much and pissed her off
and so she didn't like take off the nail
polish I guess I'm kind of like unhinged
the glue with that she had used a little
bit if she had used acetone you know as
the nail polish remover so she just
painted blue over it thankfully was a
light color so appendage and one right
over you could really tell it was
another color or another coat underneath
it so she paints my blue color so while
she's doing this I'm like getting really
hot I just like some types of hot
flashes I swear I'm like 55 years old
but I'm just getting really hot it's
like 80 degrees nail salon middle of
summer and their little fans right like
next to their little I don't know
- like this big fan of Walmart whatever
and you hit another back turn-on I was
like connection this fan on and she was
like like no answer just kind of like a
shrug and I was like is that a yes or a
No so I just turned it on and she was
like and I continued to do my nails and
I was like if you know me turn on say no
but I'm hot as balls she like is really
like I don't know confused I guess or
just ratted by my pad cuticles and that
pig skin around my cuticle and nail bed
so she takes one of those like little
clipper things right and she doesn't
just like rip off flow piece again she
rips the freaking route out I'm telling
you of this skin seven of my fingers are
bleeding no joke I had band-aids on and
she used this like weird I was alcohol
or what imported like a little dab like
on all the lip cuts and I was like oh it
was one of the worst pains ever oh my
god she's like poor legit alcohol on
these open wounds now that she there
were blood I bleed quite easily um and
she was like yanking this skin that I
had that kind of like picked back from
nerves off she was like yanking my
cuticles and I was bleeding on seven
fingers oh my goodness and then um when
she was filing she's filing so hard like
I was like oh I kind of went like tad on
the longer side of nails I don't like
super short nails cuz it looked like
like too short it's just my preference I
like usually longer nails I don't know
that fist drop that I had a shape I
wanted because she like made up so long
I couldn't even like type of do anything
with like they were so I'm actually long
and when she was like trying to get them
even to a square cut she was like like
filing so hard I thought my fingernail
was going to fall off and not trying
funny not trying to joke and like like
I'm kind of pull my finger away and
she's like yanking it back so I don't
know this is a new thing but the past
like two years I've had to do this is
the nail salon will make you pay before
you get your nails painted I guess is a
good idea but I don't like it I guess is
not to ruin your polish or whatever but
they make you pay the tip and everything
before they make your nails so I feel
like if you give a shoddy ass tip
they're going to do a shoddy ass job on
your nails so I was like okay this has
been the most awkward painful annoying
shitty experience I'm gonna leave $2 and
I was like whatever and so I'm like how
much is it and she says $50
we go away girl I've never paid more
than $30 for this and that's an
expensive s like slaves so I was like
I've never been more than 25 or 30 here
and she was like 50 Lum nail and I'm
like 50 long nail what the like
okay just cuz I got long nails betcha me
I should pay less I use more of the nail
what you if I want to sure you had to
cut it off anyways throw it away
so really I'm doing you a favor cuz you
would have to do what that work you're
gonna charge me $50 for these shitty ass
nails with crooked wrong painting
bleeding fingers like and a sword are
you with them I'm like I never made more
they were just like not having it and I
was like okay so I was like I'm gonna
I'm gonna do the Chi overtip because at
first I thought it was kind of mean I
was like sure you through before they
feel bad but I had two doors my head
after she said 50 I was like official is
zero but then chimp and my name is it so
I thought she's gonna screw me over
so I leaved you dollars and she's like
thank you very much when I handed her my
receipt and I was like mmhmm and so she
paints my nails and doesn't give me a
topcoat this story could not get worse
you think oh it does
just wait she literally doesn't give me
a topcoat that's like the key thing it's
more important to the paint on your
nails because that's what holds it and
seals it for that least the two weeks is
supposed to laugh so I'm like not gonna
say anything come to me and where's my
top coat but whatever so I get up in the
table and you know they like see if it's
dry so they do that okay socially they
like touch your nose very lightly and
one of them gets bumped why would the 12
was her long as nasty as nails and I'm
like I'm the pinkies bumped because like
some things I'll be silent on but some
things I'm not gonna stop or if you
bought my nail from you know that's
longer be doing that thank you and she
was like I kidding it's like fire was
coming out of her ears and so she like
tipping out and so I like sat down she
tried to fix it but she didn't know I
was like add another gloss with the blue
paint on top and kind of like smear it
out with like this weird daughter thing
and I was like are you kidding me even
see there's a huge dot of excess nail
polish right there so I go to like the
like I don't know if it's LED or
whatever like blue light that tries your
nails and I think
and I walked out of there and that's my
nail salon horror story it was
never-ending grout was supposed to get
that little like a massage and little
like back massage and the warm towelette
on my hand I'd get any of that because
she hated me and I'm gonna know why cuz
I don't when you're flower gel
anyway I hope you enjoyed this story you
know magic my mom just retire my channel
become my first come to diva like me in
the rest of sunnier but therefore new
videos new videos every week thanks so
