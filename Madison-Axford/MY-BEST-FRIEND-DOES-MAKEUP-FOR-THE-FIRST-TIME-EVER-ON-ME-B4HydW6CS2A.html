never done making before she doesn't
wear makeup she likes makeup it doesn't
use this so today she's going to do my
makeup a new makeup everyday crazy
makeup thick makeup big eyelashes very
all out every single day I don't know a
naturalist so she's gonna attempt to do
my full face of makeup using a bajillion
products we have laid out here you hear
me see many of them and she's going to
do my makeup as best as she can today -
you - first time ever doing makeup so
I'm sure she'll do wonderfully with
wings and eyelashes and everything so
stop further ado let's get started I
know from past experience that you have
to do the eyeshadow first because of
what's called because of foliage we
won't fall out we're gonna do a crease
thing yes we're gonna go in with this
color right here oh no sorry oh no no
primer anything this is full this brush
is huge can every start the first thing
we're going with its matte painterly
paint-pot
so that we don't lose the color we're
going to use we're gonna do kind of a
bowl dish I color this color yeah yeah
because I know that blending is the most
important okay
this is turning out real great the next
color that we're going to use is this
gold color
we're going to go in with whatever so
now all we have to do is blend a little
why did you do oh I got some head like
cuz that brown sand I was like falls out
so I was trying to little white feet
okay we're good - okay so we're gonna do
eyeliner next and we are going to today
be using the tattoo liner no work
okay okay okay it's not too bad it's not
Madison expert okay good waiting for
them I think you're like wait I thought
yeah I was like that's hockey like Terry
so now I'm gonna go in with the fake
eyelashes okay look at open your eyes
Mary okay so you know once you put it
big I like it's sticking on that it's
like it's like the Iowa yeah he's like
it's like the middle note at the top
looks like the inner corner is like oh
yeah thanks yeah right there
okay cool okay okay what sticks to the
bottom lashes
we got the fake eyelashes on with no
issues now we're gonna go in with her
foundation and it's gonna be Mac Studio
Fix fluid out run the hand
okay so just dab a little on the Beauty
Blender and make 15 billets Madison has
great job was to keep coming on thank
you did I do it wrong no oh
cuz I'm he gets over I'm sorry close
your mouth I put on my lips well okay so
I think we have the foundation all
finished
I know concealer goes under your eyes in
a nice v-shape we blend
okay oh I forgot to get her bottom of
her nose
okay the Rimmel London so now we're done
using the powder we're gonna go in for
Madison's favorite step chocolate Soleil
so for highlighter we're going in with
the UH Nastasia Beverly Hills the next
step we're going to do is the eyebrows
and the color we're going to use is this
brown color
I browse your sisters not twins
no what the hell is is just not twins so
next we're gonna do the lips and we're
gonna first use the Kate Rimmel lipstick
in 113 it's a very sheer color mm-hmm
but that's okay because we're gonna put
the lip gloss okay so now we just use a
setting spray
okay and that is my completed makeup
look I did my hardest I tried my hardest
oh no I'm nervous oh my no is this like
dry okay we're really good
no yeah they are and this is the glue
being weird okay the look is like a
little hot but the eyes look really good
like the eyeliner for your first time
doing wings are you kidding me
diamonds are just like that sticking
probably this would I shadow no I like
it's cuz she's my friend
no if I was wearing this in public
people wouldn't be like bitch glue the
eyelash down but other than that they
really crooked

together actually so I hope you enjoyed
