lips do too cynical badass and so I
could do my pet peeves 2016 I did when
it's just 13 2014 I start my challenges
and 12 so you can see how long ago that
was I've done one recently and a lot of
stuff still pisses me the fuck off so
let's get started my first pet peeve is
when people send you the US snapchats
that are on their story I know I
probably said this and a lot of these in
videos before but they're just so annoy
you want to reiterate them um oh god and
I feel bad when people do this cuz I
don't respond to them more often than
not but I watch stories I do
I don't followed that many people on
snapchat so the people I do follow I
want to see their stories and and I
watch them and so I seen your story and
I don't need to send me the same fucking
thing because I don't know how to
respond to that you obviously want
everyone to see it not just me so I
already saw it when it's on your story I
don't need to now see it again
personally I don't understand why people
send it to everyone in their story what
are the other either make a person or
make it kind of neutral and personal and
send it to everyone on the store I don't
understand why it's sent to multiple
things I never do that I don't
understand it I don't know the next
thing I'll supposed to do with snapchat
it's usually with guys and it's when
like he either aw snap to him or he'll
snapchat me okay so there's one
interaction so like he such as me and I
stop and talk back and then he doesn't
stop there back again and like I asked
him a question or an answer or expected
a response and he doesn't respond right
for all society society I just saying
again and then he just so say like what
the fuck I can see if it's like just a
picture me or like what's up
I wouldn't respond to that either but I
only really talk to people when I have
something to say or I want to know
something and really piss them off its
girls like to talk as you guys guys like
don't respond a lot of the time and it's
like what what are you doing what really
you opened it
bitch you opened it next is do not ask
me how much money I make on YouTube I
haven't asked this more times than I can
ever ever remember it's actually
ridiculous
I probably asked this more times than
what my name is ya know when people ask
me I'll make up a number because I
really don't give a crap and I'll
usually
lower than what I make because I don't
want to give people any range under
contract I am signed for with my YouTube
partnership I'm not allowed to tell
people how much I make and so for people
to ask me that that's extremely rude and
unprofessional how dare you really I
don't go up and ask what your yearly
income in your family household is and I
don't ask what your mom or dad or you
make at their tops or your job so please
do not continue ask me just because I
have a unique job doesn't mean that you
can know exactly my paycheck at the end
of the month thank you very much loud
breathing I don't understand why people
have to breathe so loud unless you have
a diagnosed breathing problem that is
fine I'm talking now people were like in
decent shape just living life and like
I'm like what the hell like did you just
run a mile
no okay did you just no okay
now I want to hear you breathing Oh
heavily it this is me off like it
actually is cringy to me it actually
makes me squirm and I don't want to be
in the same room with someone breathing
that loud if you have a breathing
problem that's different if you have
asthma if you need oxygen like any other
problem it's fine if you're like really
overweight yeah or something you know
just like certain things that lead to
breathing heavily that's not what
bothers me it's it's just like people
breathing really loud for no real reason
like I don't need to hear you
oh just cringy a little makes me
uncomfortable and it kind of sucks like
you're bout to throw up on me so I'm
gonna leave thank you excessive staring
oh my god the rudest thing you can do to
someone is not stare once but
continuously stare up and down giving me
the evil eye like I am on your like bad
list or something you most more than not
you do not fucking know me sweet your
eyes off me or take a picture it'll last
longer
I cannot stand when I go to a freaking
mall restaurant school classes whatever
and maybe I'm in heels maybe I'm not
maybe I'm wearing makeup maybe I'm not
but you feel the need to constantly
start me that's usually what I'm gonna
make up in heels and I don't get why
fucking girls cannot go out in public
without girls and guys staring them down
for wearing something that makes me
confident I'm gonna wear a dresser I
want to wear pants or I'm gonna wear
flats and heels or I want to wear makeup
I wear no makeup and you better not
stare at me for longer than two seconds
you go Sarah me you can judge me
internally but then move on if I catch
you staring at me whatever if I look
back in that direction and catch you
still staring at me
whatever
time we are done I'm going to stare you
down until you look away I'm gonna be
like this if you don't get your fucking
eyes off me I'm gonna come over there
and make you take them off of me you can
look at me sure but don't make it rude
if you don't know the difference between
your and your and there there there and
all the fuckin other grammatical errors
that are made every day by idiocracy
that is this society a destination you
need help I don't understand you learn
that so so young in school it's not that
hard
let me just one okay grammar lessons
medicine there are two forms of your
your and your okay here we go these two
do not look anything alike
while you are your your your possession
what you own your family your dog your
laugh your peanuts but when you are
something that means you plus R equals
you posture p r e that means you are
something you are illiterate
so before you want to come up with a
comment or anything really on YouTube
Instagram Twitter know how to spell
let's just go through the various real
quick also not that hard just a pet
peeves video or language arts video I'll
never know so first there teach eerie is
a place okay he is going there I live
there you are here not there really not
that hard I are means it belongs to you
the I I want that
it is mine the fact that there's neither
means is yours their dog their life
whatever they possibly are e here we go
again is they are if there's two words
combined together Betty there's a bunch
of you I think is combining two words I
don't want somewhere this is so hard
they are slaying they are stupid they're
dumb they can't spell
this next one gets me so pissed okay
when you blatantly let a guy know you're
interested and he does fucking nothing
I cannot have big enough balls for the
two of us you've got a coming clutch
somewhere okay you gotta help me out on
this dude I literally have told so many
guys because I don't want to waste my
fucking time with a time when it does he
like me going out I'm wondering I don't
know either like me I'm gonna move the
hell on no next time I'm moving to hell
on but you know what it's fine and I
blatantly tell him or someone else in
that I like him and I like him and he
doesn't do anything about it you know
what I like you if you don't like me
tell me that you don't like me back I'm
gonna inch to me I move on we can just
be friends we don't stalk ever again but
it's like you're just gonna leave me
hanging because I know you know and you
know I know you know and you know I know
and we're not doing anything about it
and you probably you probably really
don't like me but I don't know that
you're not giving me any sign and it's
like if you do like me then act on it
ask me to do something because I'm not
gonna turn you down if you've heard that
I like you I think you're cute oh and I
don't understand why guys to me so dumb
sometimes I hate fucking automatic
toilet seats for two reasons
but mainly because most of them don't
fucking flush and then you look like a
disgusting person because I won't flush
I spent 37 minutes yesterday in a
bathroom because I wouldn't flush you
think I'm joking no I'm not joking I was
not going to leave until that flush down
the toilet
do I poop no it was just pee but you
know that is one of my pet peeves when
people do not fucking flush but these
automatic toilets wouldn't flush and the
Cheesecake Factory
and they didn't have a button on the
side usually a lot of will have a button
you can push when you're like come on
you won't fucking flush listen it of a
button and I was waving my hand and my
foot and I kept sitting up and down up
and down on the stall I know but I flush
and then finally 37 minutes later I
flushed and my mom was like did you die
she's like texting me and I was like
girl my phone is on the table if you put
on Metroid's and have the button if you
create automatic flushing toilets have a
button more than half the time they'll
flush while you're not even on peeing
okay if I'm shopping Target Walmart
grocery store wherever and I put my
things up on the little conveyer belts
and then the person Miami comes up
that's fine well I gotta get in line but
there's me is what I'm barely even like
there's this much maybe space at the end
for an item after all my shit and then
you reach like literally push me almost
out of the way to reach one of those
little separator bars put it down
push myself I've had something like
nighttime then I kind of shut myself a
little bit I'm like how dare you touch
my stuff I don't know Germany ask nasty
s with open hands well I don't know what
they've been touchin rush it and it's
happened to a lot of my family and
friends as well when we all agree it's
really annoying you can wait two more
fucking seconds holding your cold ass
and milk before you touch my stuff and
try to move it my old baby needs to be
like when you would say I'll take a coke
and they say it's Pepsi okay and and
yeah whatever but that's just people and
I realize that's just people because I
worked in food interest rate so I
realize that's just people telling you
what they have
I guess Pepsi okay and then people would
say yes or no today this literally
happened today I said I'll take a coke
and she said okay and bitch I know the
difference between coke diet coke
caffeine free diet coke coke zero and
all the Pepsi so if you think you're
gonna pull a quick one over on me and
give me Pepsi when I ordered a coke and
think I won't notice you had another
thing coming for you okay okay so she
she says okay and I'm like okay great
she puts down the soda and I just I had
this weird feeling there's something's
gonna be wrong what he saw it I and I
drink it I'm like I can drink Pepsi I've
gotten used to a state despise it but I
gotten used to it because my college
it's the only thing they have but I
would prefer Coke any day and I was
gonna just go to water and make it easy
but no no I had to go with the Coke
Pepsi and some I'm drinking it I like
did she literally think that I wonder
this is Pepsi she knows that a Spencer
said Pepsi when she just like dispersed
it and I'm like man this is Pepsi and
she's like mm-hmm
and I'm like I ordered coke she's like
mm-hmm
and I'm like Coco Puffs do two different
things okay I'll just take a water and
she didn't say anything else and I was
like I know you she probably hacked a
loogie in my salad because I hit you up
with pitch that's not coke
I cannot stand when guys put on a
douchebag facade quit like make this
like a worldwide trend hashtag stop
douchebag facade 2016 it guys
it is not cute it is not hot it is not
sexy to put on this I'm cool I'm so cool
I drink all this shit I smoke all this
shit
I have all these girls I'd abandon bet
that's not cute for more than 95 percent
of the human girl nation so unless you
find someone who loves that lifestyle go
after her but more often than not I
don't want to hear about how much you
drank at your frat party or how much we
used to mix the other day or how many
people you hooked up with or how many
one-night stands you had the previous
semester I don't care
stop trying to be cool I don't want you
to be a sensitive ass crybaby but at the
same time I want you to be respectable
to yourself and to me and stop trying to
act so much better than me and everyone
else because you're really not you're a
human as my and we're all the same so at
the end of the day if you drink that's
fine if you smoke I don't like it but
whatever
if you sleep around that's your choice
but don't try to use that as a way to
get ahead or speed deemed cool it's not
it just kind of makes you look like a
loser who's not going anywhere because
that's what you do cool and successful
in life you got another thing coming for
you in your future after college so if
you're not ready you want to subscribe
to my channel become a first company do
you like me the Roses on here in Japan
if anybody is suppose new videos every
week thanks so much for watching guys
love you bye
