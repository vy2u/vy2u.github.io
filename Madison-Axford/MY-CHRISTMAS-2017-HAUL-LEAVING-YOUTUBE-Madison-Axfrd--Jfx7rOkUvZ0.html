since I uploaded my last video I've in a
way dreaded making this comeback video
because I'm in college that's not an
excuse but that's like where I'm at and
what I'm doing that's what I've been
dedicating so much of my time to YouTube
went on the back burner and I feel like
I've done like 20 of these comeback
videos in the past like two years
because I keep sporadically leaving
unannounced for months but that's what
I'm doing it's just like I'm enjoying
college because I don't have much time
left I hated the first year two years of
my college experience so much I was just
so unhappy I wasn't at the right college
I wasn't with the right people I wasn't
doing the right major at the time you
know everything was a mess and so I
wasn't situated and fully living to the
fullest and that's cheesy and loving
what I was doing until like my junior
year and now senior year which I'm
having at the time of my life it's
almost over so I'm trying to enjoy it so
today is my Christmas haul I thought
what better way to come back onto my
channel than doing eh I mean YouTube
traditions that's 20,000 years every
person who's in the beauty world or
really any realm of YouTube I feel like
does these videos this year it has been
amazing for me my personal life I've
never had such good relationships of my
family one um I'm healthy oh my god that
was like I don't know I had a few like
scary like I'm like a hypochondriac side
if you like scares this year but I have
my health and that's so important to me
and I'm so thankful for that I have
amazing friends you know few and far
between with me and friendships I don't
have a hundred thousand friends I've
been screwed over so many times before
by people I'm in relationships with it's
like a relationship or like a French if
you know I've just been screwed over as
we probably all have but it can be so
long to find the good true friends I can
trust and want to be around and I really
have found that this past year
especially my best friend Mohini like
she's like my ride-or-die like I love
her to death she's like a sister to me
and our shows growing even more and then
and and and now I have a boyfriend
and
it's so stupidly giddy over this every
time it's like it's like brand-new or
something but I it's so weird to say
because I haven't had a well really a
good relationship ever every
relationship I've had in the passes and
did just like like really bad and this
relationship is just going so well his
name is David oh I'm just like it what
am i doing
you should definitely follow him keep up
to date with our relationship um but I
just I don't know I adore him he's
everything I've ever looked for like he
makes me feel so special I love him he's
perfect and we're very happy real quick
before I get to this long ass Christmas
haul I'm sorry I also have to give the
disclaimer of the Christmas haul what
was it in like 2012 we all would be like
we're not trying to brag but I'm just
gonna show you the $500,000 worth of
stuff I got for Christmas today
I guess I'll just hop in with what my
sister got me first okay I have it all
all my presents like balanced on chairs
so if I make it through that drop
without dropping something that would be
amazing but I already dropped something
she got me something that she knew I
really wanted I didn't ask for it but
she knew that I've been talking about it
and I would never just like fights for
myself but it's the Ariana Grande
dangerous woman tour sweatshirt that I
did not go to the store but I love
sweatshirts they're like the only
clothing I wear if I'm not dressed up
and it says dangerous with tort on the
front and then on the sleeves you
there's like hair on it that's so
medicine it's just Ariana Grande and
then alright a guy and then I already
wore today that's why fast and then the
back is this picture of her
this is dangerous and it's iconically
front cover photo with the bunny ears I
love this I'm gonna wear this so much
and my over this was a call I because I
I don't know I love her next I'll move
on to my boyfriend anyway he got me um
we exchanged gifts
earlier than Christmas because we don't
live in the same state so we knew it
would be like um not on Christmas okay
so the first thing he got me which I
don't know if you guys have heard of
this but I had
your PIN and it's called tile mate and
it's this little keychain thing I
already have it on my keys so I'm just
gonna show you on the back if you can
see it's this little like it's like this
big and it's called a tile and it's just
like white and you hook it on your keys
and it's a blue tubes like helper finder
of your keys and phone if you lose them
I do always misplace my phone because it
falls in this one part of my couch like
way down in it and I never think to look
there so this is going to come in great
handy because if you lose your phone say
like you hit this little thing on the
tile and then it like rings an app on
here or whatever it makes it nice and
that helps you find it and if you put
your keys with this on it you can go to
the app that connects it like blue
truthy and then this beeps or whatever
so you can find her keys and it's just
cute it is perfect and like that will
always come in handy so yes then he got
me okay I've won this every single day
since he gave it to me it's my favorite
little thing ever
uh yeah he got me a necklace from Zales
sales right girls what oh my god it
pulls up some box and I'm like oh my god
what and I was like dying I couldn't
open if like ten years because I was so
excited and I like didn't want it to be
over I don't know does anyone else feel
like that like I don't just like river
one gift so I'm like yay like I took
this whole like theatrical scene like
it's like this whole ordeal I was so
excited I couldn't open it forever and
we're just sitting those icky I mean I
finally opened it and this is like
beautiful necklace and there's like a
little heart I love it
it's just perfect it's a thoughtful like
I witness every day cuz not with me so
he's with me a necklace spirit and I
just don't know I adore II so the last
thing he got me which is another thing
that I would never buy myself because I
feel like I just like by myself perfumes
but he got me okay
in Amazon echo what this is so
unexpected because he's doing very
expensive CEO and I was like what I
don't have like a speaker like I don't
have a good speaker I don't have
anything to play music from so if I'm
doing makeup if I'm getting ready if I'm
ever listening to music in my apartment
on my own like it's literally just
coming on with my phone and it's like a
tiny little like speaker that isn't very
loud and I always say I'd rather listen
to music like blaring than at all like
it has to be so loud I think I'm
partially deaf to be honest so this is
me amazing for that but also like you
should these things some commercials all
the time we're doing what's the one that
you use this I'm gonna have in my
apartment
oh and then I can just like ask it
freaking things its little like play
music and I'm so excited look any match
to it
you made sure that it matched my decor
with my apartment like how perfect is he
and how annoying am i that he had to do
that for me but like I can't keep
bragging that I have a perfect boyfriend
but I really do and I'm so thankful for
him and he knows that but I just I just
absolutely love him so thank you so much
David

excited where that like freaked out and
my mom was like you're gonna freak out
and I did then I got a robe because my
mom pointed out the mine's like
disgusting my pink one down my apartment
which is disgustingly dirty and I'm
throwing it away as soon as I get back

over it and like eyeliner like it's just
a mess so I got this cute line from Joe
Boxer it has like little hearts all over

like all the tour dates from the world
of magnetic yeah I have fake you know
poser for wearing this not really
listening to them at all
but it's fine it's cute I'm sorry
Metallica fan I've got this little sweat
sweat because I like only wear sports
rods in the summer months 4s tops
because I just get too hot and they're
cute but this one looks a little tiny so
I'm gonna see if it fits my boobs have
gotten bigger so we'll see but it's like
a two-piece thing and I love it like it
Sophie I really hope it works and fits
me because I would wear that all the
time and then she tell me these leggings
which I really like they're black but
then they have like camo down here I
know a lot of people don't like camo but
I love camo I have so much camo stuff
and then it also like has this connector
part it's like a messy see-through
material and she's like I've had to see
through because it's you and I was like
when your mom don't see too well it was
that you were see through everything so
yeah they're very cute and I run all the
time in the gym like I love running
that's another thing I've gotten like
I've taken up this year is just like I
run all the time at my gym then I go to
you and so like athletic clothes as
always much needed because I go there so
frequently and I can't wear jeans there
obviously
I've actually got these at the gym like
20 times for an appropriate clothing
even though it's a sports bra or like
workout shorts they're always like no so
much the skin is shiny and I'm like what
am I supposed to wear like a sweatshirt
like I don't understand anyway then I

their jumpsuits from Norway and I love
them I got a blue one lesson to do my
dad ruined it with bleach in the laundry
then I bought myself a baggy like big
pink one that I wear still all the time
and then my mom got me this black one
which is one of their tight fitted ones
so I literally wore this out today it
clings so tight to skin so it looks like
your ring like very tight leggings and
it just is all one piece it's so warm
and cozy they're very expensive I think
they're run over 100 dollars or so for
one but if you're looking to invest in
them you definitely should I think
they're amazing and I never regret when
