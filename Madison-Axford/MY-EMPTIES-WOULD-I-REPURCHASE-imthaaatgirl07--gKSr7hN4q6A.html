product empties product and empties
video ok medicine um so this is where I
tell you whether or not I regret buying
these products or if I love to them and
I just give you my honest review on them
in case you were wondering about buying
them if you're wondering if you know if
they worked or not they're true to what
people said they were I don't okay it's
been a little bit since I've done a
video so I'm a little like well I'm
gonna need you get centered again so
these are products I finished up over
the past quite a few months I was stupid
and throw away all of my makeup wipes
like makeup remover wipes cuz I was like
everyone knows all I use is the original
blue Neutrogena ones like those are my
love's like there's so much I get
everything off so easily without tearing
or not tearing but without pulling or
tugging at my skin or eyes for long
periods of time so I threw those all the
way cuz you know what kind of use but
these are products I've used over the
past few months that I'm going to share
my opinions on to you today the first
project here it's very sad for me
because I had a reaction to it um this
is a first day beauty's ultra Repair
Cream and I was always a huge first day
beauty fan let's get that straight first
and I'm not saying I'm not now but
something's changed so my hands I ever
not just needs to be didn't know that
means my hands the blood circulation is
cut off like grater in here and it's
like diminishes kind of throughout the
rest of my hands with bright pink and
they're very red and they're very purple
all the time and they're cold that being
said they're also very chapped just cuz
I have dry skin all over in general and
so I was like oh my god ultra Repair
Cream yes and I had used quite a bit of
this not that much of a reaction but I
had a very very bad dry spell where just
awful patches of dry like I don't know
if it was X matter what it was popped up
on my hands especially and so thank God
it was in my face or psychic itis my
hands and then there became just these
bumps everywhere like these gross 8g
bumps and I was like oh my gosh the only
thing I'm use on my hand because I don't
use lotions hand creams that often if at
all the only thing I used was this and
so I know I had a reaction to this which
is very sad but I threw it away cuz I
don't want this near me anymore
I have other like Gold Bond lotions and
stuff I use that are specialized for
just skin where this could be face body
skin hand foot whatever
I'm very excited to say that this
product in general it did work doesn't
mean told brand sucks or anything
because they don't I do like some of
their products but this in particular
gave me like a rash on my hand it was
gross so scary so no good bye the next
thing I have is the Beauty Blender
cleaner look what it's called solid or
whatever I guess it is this I love but I
hate at the same time so uh how many
flora it's one ounce just keep that in
mind and I clean my brushes so I brushes
daily but I clean my view butter daily
because you need to wet it and why just
wet in you know old foundation so I went
in my Beauty Blender daily and clean it
daily my brushes are about it once a
week so as you can see all I have is a
little bit around the rim left because I
only had this for about a month and it's
gone so I do like this it did clean my
Beauty blenders like I've never had
anything clean them before but it lasted
for like a few weeks of cleaning and I'm
like I almost lying that'll last me a
while because it's sixteen dollars that
being said there's a certain kind of
soap I forgot what it's called because
I'm an idiot I'll put it right here that
my mom like researched and found out
that it's the same as what this kind of
soap is it's really just soap it's
whatever this cut is it like lavender
sometimes so and so I got some one that
it cleans the exact same it's amazing I
will not be repurchasing this because
it's definitely not worth the money for
this small of a container of it and for
how many uses I got out of it and really
it how many uses I didn't get out of it
it's already gone so next I have my
cleaning clear person gel ten with
benzoyl peroxide this my face itches
this was always the acne medication that
I went to I'm not on any medically
prescribed acne medication but my skin's
being a little bit right now so I
probably need to get on some this is the
acne medication I use from little on and
I hate it it didn't do anything I put
huge white gobs of this acne medication
on my face almost every night for it you
have no results so it's not saying first
of all I just don't like this so I got
the clean and clear spot treatment I
think that has self silic acid which
really dries up and burns the acne away
which I like better than the assistant
do anything it just felt like gobs on my
face so I'm glad that I got something
that I can actually feel doing something
to my skin whether that's good or bad I
have yet to discover because I won't
even using it for two days and nothing
else
got away in two days just like nothing
really would with any kind of medication
for acne but this I found out was the
helmet was not helping my skin at all so
know by next I have these are all
products that I like regard buying
apparently I'm not regret buying but
will not be repurchasing next time my
L'Oreal go 360 clean deep exfoliating
scrub um it's a face wash with this
little detachable sponge now the thing
of this is I feel like it never really
got clean and just kind of spread my
acne around
I was never deep playing this besides
like running out of the shower head for
two seconds and then squirting this face
scrub on to it and then just going in on
my face I did like having a brush I felt
like I was really giving in like my
pores and like you know parts of my skin
that I wouldn't hit with my hands
however I feel like I never got clean
and was it one of the culprits leading
to my recent acne breakout breakouts so
I will not be repurchasing this I had a
long time ago and I retried it and it
did nothing it didn't make my skin worse
that being said but it didn't do
anything better or help my scar to hell
bite and it's but it didn't help my skin
at all either next I have my master
conceal by Maybelline concealer in the
shade 20 light
I was always kind of bad at picking
concealers and foundations I'm awful at
matching colors because I don't give up
but I always have a yellow or orange
undertone foundation rather than pink
which is my normal skin tone because I
don't like that if I don't like my skin
tone very much that's my personal
preference and choice and I can choose
whether or not I want to wear a pink or
yellow undertone foundation therefore I
don't need any haters opinions on it but
since I do wear a yellow undertone
foundation I need to go very light on my
concealer because like Concession up at
the same shade or really anywhere near
the same shade as your foundation it
should be it should not be white but it
shouldn't be the shady foundation so
because for me at least because it uses
as a highlighter I use it under my eyes
down the bridge of our harami the other
bridge of my nose on my forehead chin
and keep it go to highlight all the
areas and I just an amazing job super
thick but not in a gross way super thick
in a good way covers everything my
under-eye circles are noticeable without
this and
I didn't realize that until one day I
forgot to put this on when I did a full
face I was like holy what are those
source of my under-eye bags that I never
usually see when I use this so I love
this this is great at concealing all the
things we don't want to see next I have
two elf daily brush Quinn's cleanses
which is what I was just it's an entire
channel spray that was just spraying on
my Beauty Blender and I thought that was
cleaning it it wasn't this was before I
got this all a Beauty Blender cleaner so
it's two of these little spray things
they were good for daily cleaners when I
didn't have much time but all this does
is spray a little antibacterial or so
they say mist onto your Beauty Blender
it does not get in deep and get any of
the concealer foundation powder or
whatever out of the Beauty Blender so
all your Beauty Blender is doing these
being like antibacterial eyes on the top
layer of the phone but then it's just
like running water through it which is
just gross so I'm not reproducing these
because I've found when you love which
is my special soap that I saw on the
name of to create a Beauty Blender
instead of the solid cleaner or instead
of oh the elf sprays and winners that I
used before I found out about soap next
I have ELF clear brow gel is the
double-sided one I think this is about
one or two dollars I have tried many
many many and eyebrow gel in my day
I've tried once for my line only I tried
once from Sephora I've turned this multi
ba-ba-ba-ba but the one that I love the
most itself because it's so so
heavy-duty and this held up I just don't
understand why culture doesn't self
because ona Navy sells else you know
Marshalls in TJ Maxx and Gordon's and
Target and Walmart like everyone sells
out why can all two not get it on the
shelves it's not a Sephora Ulta is not
high-end yeah they carry on but it is
not it's still a drugstore to me why
can't they carry elf elf is a great
brand it's come a long way anyway the
back time I am sorry for my rent back to
this is the eyebrow gel this is the most
heavy-duty eyebrow gel that I've ever
found a clues you browse down and they
do not move I was using one from Sephora
or no I was using one from estas to
Beverly Hills Beverly Hills love all
their products but the brow gel was just
a little too weak from my brows because
they're I don't know they're so long I
feel like that is very hard to tame them
get them down I don't know what this is
it's like glue or what but it glues them
down so the
as always my go-to and it's so cheap
which just adds on to a good pros list
of this next I have an EOS vault that I
used up I can do news anymore really
because it was scratching my lip like
this rim was scratching my lip and I was
using a kiss my lips were chapped
already and then that was just hurting
it so look so I got a new one I'm using
the coconut milk one which is the pink
and white striped one right now I love
it this was I don't know there's red
cranberry when I have pomegranate maybe
I don't know what this one was I liked
it I love us balls they're my favorite
go-to lip chapstick because they're so
portable and you throw them everywhere
I'm bringing them back and forth between
college and home and I adore them
because they're my favorite chapstick so
they don't get lost as usually because
they're like a pod it's like an egg and
you cannot not find this like little
chap sticks are so skinny they're soft
lips and stuff they're hard to find
sometimes this he's always found next I
have two foundations I and they're both
the same brand but different colors this
is covergirl outlast or they're both
covergirl outlast stay fabulous 3 in 1
foundation this is in 810 classic ivory
is also a shade off I'm wearing
currently it's usually my go-to shades a
little too dark for me but so is every
other foundation in the world so let's
move on and then this one what are all
my empties have hair on them like do
this one is in 832 nude beige a que way
way tubes hand for me I think this might
have been when I was spray tanning
during the summer um
I adore this foundation I mix it with my
other favorite foundation from the
drugstore currently which is L'Oreal
infallible Pro matte um because neither
of them are matte foundations and that's
a pro matte which is just the other one
which is Loreal Pro matte it's just a
semi matte so it doesn't matter mattify
all the way oh okay good because I like
to magnify with the powder not a
mattifying foundation I find that
mattifying foundations often oxidize
really quickly and make your skin orange
rather than this color anyway I love
these these are always my go-to
sometimes I'll use some of themselves
sometimes I will mix them with my other
one like I've already been saying but
yeah I love these foundations they are
just my ride-or-die foundations from the
drugstore
I like how I started my video with all
the products I hated I'm ending with the
products I am loving and have
repurchased numerous times
next is duo eyelash adhesive I get the
white one for some reason I've never
tried the dark black eye lash glue I
should know because I always wear
eyeliner mascara so I blend perfectly in
but I don't know why
this is the clear or this is the weight
and then dries clear eye lash glue I
can't even think about what I'm talking
about anymore and I use this all up and
this I bought a third one this is my
second one I had my first one I used up
a long time ago a second one third one I
wear eyelashes almost every day so this
is mandatory for me and it's unlike any
other eyelash glue ever living for it
and the last thing I have I think this
has been like in every empty video ever
it's Mac angel it's my absolute favorite
lipstick I have it on right now I wear
it every single day of my life if I'm
not wearing like you know obviously a
red orange or purple pink is my go-to
baby pink I love it and sometimes I'll
go to red for a while and then come back
to this and be like oh my god this is my
color this is my shins like why did I
ever leave this I look so much better in
just pink lipstick and so yeah I used
another one up and the eraser prices on
lipsticks like Mac what are you doing
that was my empties video I forgot what
count or number this is cuz I'm done
when so long so we'll just say aprox I
need up number whatever so I hope you
