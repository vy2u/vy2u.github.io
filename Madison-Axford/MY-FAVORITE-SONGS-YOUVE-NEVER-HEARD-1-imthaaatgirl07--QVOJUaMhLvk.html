series on my channel which is 20 songs
you need to know right now so it's kind
of like I have a weird taste in music I
kind of like everything except country
I'm sorry for that country whatever but
I just don't like that kind of music and
so I like pretty much everything else
and I'm gonna show you the 20 songs and
I'm currently obsessed with that aren't
really tough you know 40 hits they're
not always on the radio if ever some of
these might be so don't think this is
any menial awesome like but I haven't
heard these personally in the past month
or ever on the radio so I wanna bring
them to your attention because I think
they're amazing songs that need to be
talked about but aren't necessarily
getting the radio play that maybe they
should or could so I'm going to just
play like five to ten seconds of each
song and I want to do this every month
or every two months or whatever because
I love music music is such a therapeutic
amazing thing and I want to share with
you guys and show you the kind of music
I listen to I'm not sponsored by any of
these artists I'm not sponsored by
Spotify but if you do want to go follow
me on Spotify it's just medicine Axford
follow me you can see what I'm like
listening to currently and you can look
at on my playlist and follow them if you
want and hopefully we can bond over the
same music taste and similar songs that
we like so yes I have 20 songs you need
to know about right now and I'm going to
play a little bit for you like I said
and let's get started
I
like you gotta claim
you watch it when my brain used to feel
big
yeah
good
No
we got freedom
No
I am watching the ships and for sale
if I could fly like
this is how it feels a little word we
drove back to that scream crap while
laughing up a storm and cerise bomb
until I've got someone that none of us
could sleep and all the styrofoam began
to melt away inside
we don't have a lot but there's no
shortage here for love
let's see that Wow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
