just take one from usher it says be nice
or you'll end up on my blog and I think
it's so fitting it's ridiculous it's
like except this shit's a blog because
YouTube yeah um hold on you're too far
away come here okay thank you today I'm
doing a video that is the best health
products to me and I have ten I did not
mean to have as many but items ten
because I actually love elves I'm not
sure gotta say these are great products
if they're not like elf does no exist I
was spending have to say that because I
don't believe some people when they say
that these parks are great because they
were sponsored by them and I'm not so
you should know that I'm not sponsored
by them and that I would not be giving
this a shout-out if they weren't amazing
if I didn't repurchase them and use them
all the time
okay so these are the parks that I'm
gonna give a shout out to because
they're just amazing and I love them and
I used to hate elf I used to be like oh
my god
cuz like one like two of my brushes I
got from them broke and I was just like
oh my god I came out but I really
actually like them and this entire face
is elf
so respect it started wrong kinda dirty
too but it's my elf blush palette I
wasn't gonna get this because it was
like six bucks
but then again six bucks for four
blushes it's not that bad like I was
like oh my gum little Sloan lumps lip
and the grand scheme of things not
really so it helps with this big-ass
mirror we're gonna cover up because
that's really in your face and for
blushes now there's different colors you
can get I pick this one because I really
am in love with this color and this
color I love these blushes they're so
pigmented let me just do a swatch for
you look at that look at that
and I also have this other L blush just
because I love this color it's a single
one in some candid coral the thing is I
pity on this but the thing is these are
the exact same as
NARS blushes like nice blush same exact
amount of ounce and made in the same
Factory
I love up blushes they are so so
pigmented they're just incredible like I
don't wear blush that much but when I do
I don't wanna spend a lot of money on it
cuz I don't know how often I'll wear it
so I get these cheap ones and they are
incredible and I just keep wearing them
like every day now like I have this
color on right now and it just looks
beautiful I love love love blushes and
they're just as great as high quality
blushes because they're made in the same
place as high quality washes so
definitely check these out oh my god
worth the money they last forever
next I have an elf daily brush cleaner
I also like the brush shampoo but I've
had that one right now cuz I think they
only sell it online now I can't find in
stores this they sell at Walmart though
I've never seen that at Target or I
haven't in a while but I love this and
the brush shape what they both clean
brushes and video monitors amazingly
this is just kind of like antibacterial
spray so I'll use this for just a quick
little wash my PD blender each morning
when I put it under the water and never
buy a high-end brush cleaner because
these are amazing this $3.00 that I have
two lipsticks I have one of their
moisturizing lip sticks in flirty and
fabulous
so it's this pink color let me do a
swatch real quick gritty oh yeah oh yeah
that it's a bright pink so you know
might be hard to find how to wear this
but its most beautiful more stressing
the lippy and are just still
moisturizing you never ever split checks
to come before this it does the job of a
chapstick a lip liner and a lip sticks
it is absolute incredible my mom got me
this and I love it I wear it all the
time
and then this is a total dupe for NARS
Cruella that I wear all the time it's
ELF matte lip color in the shade rich
red it comes out like this looks like a
little pencil and yeah it's amazing it's
beautiful beautiful beautiful eyes use
this as a lip liner but then I start to
fill my lips in with it and it is
amazing it stays forever
it doesn't claim to be a 24-hour thing
but it stays on pretty damn long so I
love this on Elpis I'm using lipsticks I
judge self so hard as I feel like so
many people do when they first see it
because I was the chief section at
Target and Walmart put enough it's
better than a lot of products from other
mega brands drugstore or cayenne next I
just have one brush this is the brush I
use for highlighter concealer powder
everything right now I'm using a
highlighter I'd like three of these
brushes though it's the elf small
tapered brush my mom has this everyone
has this that I know okay it's like a
nice pointed brush like it fits under
your eye perfectly it's perfect
highlight brush it does everything
perfectly is the most perfectly shaped
brush I know a lot of high-end companies
make this kind of a brush this $3 from
ELF $3 is incredible I've you have to
have this brush elf small tapered brush
I couldn't find out Walmart my target
has it look for this this is the most
necessary brush you need like literally
for your makeup collection just buy this
then I have an elf baked eyeshadow
and this is the palette of brown bonanza
is what it's called I love elf baked
eyeshadows l regular eyeshadows are okay
I mean they're pretty good but elf baked
are just these like sparkly amazing
dupes for like steel and urban decay
shadows and I love that I'm gonna swatch
this look at that
okay okay argument over that I have it's
really messy but it's clear brow and
lash gel this is just like Maybelline's
last gel except it's not $6 if it's two
and does the job just well I just have
to use this I don't do anything
color or fill in my eyebrows but I like
to just glue them down if you will so
they don't go crazy and look why out the
day when I wake up sometimes they're
standing up and it's like what happened
so I just like to go through these with
this gel and they stick and they get a
little hard took the day they're not
like hard but you know stiffer so they
stay in place and look perfect
so I love this literally it's the same
thing as Maybelline and any other hunch
poke myself in the eye okay that just
happened any other eyebrow gel so just
get the alcohol the next product is
messy again and it's a BB cream I tried
out foundation and I did not like it um
it was very very thick it did not blend
well I try that like ten million years
ago this is the BB cream I picked up on
a whim because it was on sale and I was
like whatever I'll just get it and try
it I have it on right now it's flawless
it covers everything so well it's thick
but it's easily blendable you don't need
much to cover up everything it's amazing
coverage and has SPF of 20 so I have the
shade
here yeah but okay so let me just pull
on my hand to show you okay well that
was freaking way too much this is what
looks like and that if you can see that
consistency it's very oily when it first
goes on
I'm not Whaley liking bad way but like
wet and moist easy to move around slick
you know and coverage crap your pants II
because my legs do bright but it's
amazing um and then it dries more matte
and then just put a little pressed
powder over top and you're good to go
not training all day not only shiny
stuff hi later on so yeah I love this it
is just as amazing as like a high
high-end or great drugstore foundation
the cover-up is amazing any redness
freckles zits blackheads scarring
anything is covered with this the last
product I have is kind of hated by some
people I'm kind of loved by some people
in its elf expert liquid liner in jet
black I am I feel like I'm like cheating
on my lifestyle by Maybelline but I just
picked this up it's like two dollars I
think this elf is not one down the
products anymore they're like only up to
dollar in store and I'm like the Hank
does not want to use the beam anyway so
yes it's I just think suck sounds like
why not
and yes given the brush is a little
flimsy it's so thin that it's easy to
create a line like that's what I use
right now it's so much easier to get a
thin line it's a little flimsy you gotta
have a little more steady hand than with
lines stiletto but was lion-o the
pointer I love it but it's so thick that
you always if you want to do eyeliner
you buddy do the damn saying you better
do the eyeliner and go all out with it
because the lengths a little applicator
is so thick and then it makes you have a
thick line almost no matter what it just
don't you can do it get a thin line with
this it's so thin that if you make
mistake like it's not hard to cover up
and you can build it up if you want it
thicker but also get a very thin line if
you don't want to be like eyeliner in
your face I hope you enjoyed this video
which is my favorite out products one
time definitely check them out they're
worth your money even though it's not
that much money at all they're actually
incredible products that are worth your
money and are just like any high-end
beauty product like they didn't have a
label on it you could not know that this
was else and yeah i say else like it's a
bad thing it's not but you know what I
mean I feel like else just some people's
like oh you're wearing elf and it's like
bitch is amazed
so yeah that's one sorbet outfit then
