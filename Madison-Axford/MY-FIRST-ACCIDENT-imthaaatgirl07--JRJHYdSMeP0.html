little different it's more of a personal
topic that I don't think I've talked
about a lot on here but it is like the
crazy story behind my messed up in knees
now this happening in second grade at my
friend Rachel Kane's house Rachel be
watching this hi i love you um and it
was nothing like because of her weird to
add her house obviously um and so yeah
my knees have always been a little
messed up I don't have a lot of tissue
around them to keep the kneecap in place
that's like missing it's been that way
since I was little and Irish dance
really tore that apart as well so my
knees have always been all over the
place but today's story is why i have so
many likes cars and like discoloration
and purple on my knees um but yeah so my
kneecaps have always been really loose
and going everywhere it's wearing knee
brace allowed by the time because
they're so messed up I had to do knee
exercises I talked about this little in
like really old videos on mine but if
you haven't seen those like you might
not know that I even have had this
problem I can walk I'm so thankful for
that like I know it's not that serious
of a problem is just a little a little
turbulence that we have to get over oh
okay what had happened was this my knees
are I don't know if you can see but
they're very yet you can we won't be
able to it's like how many appearance
and won't look cute so my name is I'm
very purple and red and there is even
though happened about 11 years ago there
is still scarring all over my knees not
obvious like we got her knees but like
you can be like what's their knees don't
look right like something's up so I was
at my friend rachel's house still love
her to death she's amazing and we
decided for some reason like they had a
treadmill out their house and just to
get on i think it was like funny like I
don't know why we thought it'd be fun
but we are crazy of children's that we
thought it would be fun and um she was
always more athletic and like stuff like
that than me she played soccer should
know the stuff and I was always like the
little person in the back like getting
chosen last for gym I didn't do
athletics I wasn't good at I wasn't
athletic let's just say that will be
done okay I wasn't athletic no one
wanted me on their team because I would
freaking fail up every game that we
played in p but um yeah so if some
reason we got on the treadmill I think
we were both barefoot actually I'm not
sure though because I know I didn't have
shoes on but I don't remember if she did
her and I'm so long ago but our parents
were
always just like us like children of the
house um how old were we were seven I
think seven eight I think I should her
brother was in the basement or something
cuz like we wouldn't just be left home
alone anyway it's been a long time since
I told this story okay so um brother
spider in like playing they're older
than us a lot older so they might have
been playing video games in the basement
or something but anyway we on the
treadmill for like two seconds and like
you know with the terminal there so like
the little road park the road part the
like treadmill part and there's like the
places you can stand on the side it's
like the little like little I don't feel
like that why'd you know I'm talking
about so like if you want to step off
and get you breath for a second you can
so we were kind of both on those I don't
know how I managed to both going to trim
at the same time but then this is why
this accident happened and so she was
like I said always athletic so like we
hopped on and she cranked up the speed
and I was like oh oh yeah I don't know
if we should do that and she was like no
because she was great she was doing fine
she was you know running and I just like
got on and like she hopped off somehow I
had hopped on and as soon as I did I
like felt like it was like big ticket
just my feet went out from underneath me
was going so fast and I fell and instead
of just letting myself roll off the back
of Sherman was not that long what is it
like two three four feet long I kept
going and going and crawling and
crawling as fast as I could on the super
high speed on the treadmill my palms and
my knees were a mess because I wouldn't
for some reason seven-year-old adriel
medicine thought that she thought I
think I was seven yeah she thought that
if I would just let myself roll off the
treadmill somehow I would be rolled
underneath the treadmill and get like
chopped up into a million pieces and die
like I literally thought something like
sucked on the treadmill when really I
would have just rolled right off and
there's tons of empty space behind me I
could just file on the carpet but no I
was crawling and like Rachel couldn't
stop the thing where I was like stopping
stopping oh my god my knees may obey her
my knees man is and we couldn't shoot
know what button and we're really going
on and I was crawling and crawling and
crawling on the treadmill for a good
luck to to a half minutes this is a long
long ass time if you think about it to
be crawling on a high speed on a
treadmill she finally gets it stopped I
just like roll off and I'm just like
what just happened like oh my god I'd
never been in like a gruesome accident
or anything before I was seven so it was
like crazy for me too
see what I was seeing there's blood
everywhere on me there wasn't blood on
the carpet anything but there's blood
everywhere there was a yes sorry if
you're queasy X know now but they were
like you could see almost like the white
bones of my knee and knee cap like all
three layers of skin had been burned
through there was a yellow gooey stuff
like boozing out everywhere I don't know
why was yellow I don't know what that
was but it was using out everywhere I'm
both my knees and I didn't call my mom
cuz I was so scared like she gave me so
mad I mean I don't wanna go to the ER
I'm so scared so we just went to a
kitchen and her mom got home later and
her mom was like oh my god and we were
just like we put like out rubbing
alcohol on it and stuff and we bandaged
up my knees there was like 19 branches
on my knees and then my palms weren't
that bad at all really my knees really
took the beating I don't know how that
happened but I'm glad that nothing
really happened to my hands or my palms
but I'm gonna have bandages on them for
sure but it wasn't as bad as my knees
like there was no skin off it was
disgusting and awful but that's how I
got the scarring on my knees and I still
love Rachel it wasn't her fault at all
um it was both of us just being too
young to work of treadmill by ourselves
and speed was too fast and I was just
enough and non-athletic dance and I felt
and I couldn't have just my so roll off
I had to crawl on it forever so that's
how I my knees good on my stuff but yeah
so I've always had pumps my knees
jumping dancing running it always gets
them a little messed up i can't do it
for long durations of time because
they'll gids kind of screwy and I was
worth a knee brace and do the knee
exercises to strengthen at the tissue
around my kneecaps once again but yeah
those are many stories and that's
actually how I met Jeff is I walked up
to him Eric lot under the table and
