products the past month of january i
can't believe it's Yuri 2015 already did
january happen I don't know anyway
without further ado let's get started so
my first cigarette is anyone in college
anyone in colleges favorite it's just as
a staple mac and cheese easy mac yes um
there's not much I can say about this
just amazing and it's quick little lunch
or dinner when you can't go out or the
weather sucks or whatever the problem is
you're studying this is a go to sing for
me at least so i have x rays my real can
adjust to eat them whatever and they're
so good so yeah quick easy that's my
life motto okay next I have some body
sprays as a show up this isn't that
awkward I don't like its company anyway
body spray yes i love these victoria
your body sprays I never used to like
them because i never took time to smell
them I literally went to store and smell
them all of them and you've hurt me I
read this one before but I'll erase my
office smells all of them and I got this
one her species total attraction i had
this on a lot of my videos it's amazing
it says it smells like cherry orchid and
the LI blossom it's the red one so I
love this and I think it's a newer one
and then this is the even newer one
which this was on sale a few weeks ago
for five dollars so I was like yes it's
love addict wild orchid and let it warm
but i love them boats I just love books
bring these and they were this one's 15
and it's also for five dollars I love
them and you can just use them so much
there's tons of product and
team in them and so yes i love these you
should ever check out these not gonna
lie by the pink brand they're just crazy
here and i always overlook them but now
i love and they'll definitely be getting
more of these two okay then if you will
like our like meat and you're very pale
if you want some color during the winter
I don't use this often but sometimes i
will use uh self tanner sometimes we're
going out or something i just want a
nice little color and this is instant
it's by in a boat in its the deep dark
color one so i love this is like five
dollars per drugstore so I just have a
bottom of this with me and I use it
sometimes and color is awesome smite by
far my favorite subterra I've ever found
okay then we have makeup favorites
actually everyone more random favorite
and it's O'Keefe's working hands hand
cream if you know me I post over a
hundred pictures of my hands on Twitter
daily no okay but I love this stuff they
prepared of my dry chapped hands I have
not had a pat of hands this winter and
I've uses every night I think that might
be wise for my hair drive me nuts these
fans on
turn it up okay anyway I've hit pan or
whatever we want to call it for a lotion
container but literally you so much of
this and I don't know I just love it
just feel kind of sick and greasy on
your hands but I put it on when I'm
going to bed so it doesn't really matter
and um you know the groups they doesn't
really affect me but seriously I walk up
site every day in the cold and this just
has made my hands good for my hands like
you may think they're so like we're
looking but this very good my hands last
year when I was named walking inside the
cold were all bloody and they are not
this year so i am going into 20 keeps
working hands on crim so yeah anyway
moving on to makeup products so the
first one not really make us but kind of
its chapstick total hydration soothing
oasis three and one lip care I felt like
this commercial ad before every video I
watched those like what the heck I'm a
target and I'll just try it I was like
I'll should pick this up and try it and
I really like this as in just a nice
basic chapstick it takes like their chap
stick to a whole new level soon realize
this doesn't have a flavor but it's just
the mich looking one I really like it it
just makes sense really
put this on every night before I go to
bed as well in my lipstick Nachman chap
so we're not check this winter we're
doing good then I have to Mac products I
have the math family paint pot which is
like um a long we're like thing to make
your eyeshadow as long which is
basically like eye shadow primer but
it's like a waxy kind of thing see if
that I love this if I tweet about this I
don't know what it's been my whole life
I don't know what i've been using
eyeshadow primers when I conceived this
long wires product thing paint line oh
my god is amazing it makes the colors of
my eyeshadow folkish so amazing i can
just stand out here look so flawless and
I was like oh my god where's spin my
whole life what was a dream out this
interface your eyeshadows camp so much
more and i definitely recommend getting
any of the paint pots by Mac painterly
Paint Pots a good one to start out with
I love it oh my goodness and then i have
a mac eyeshadow which is really really
clever for me I never usually get close
like this it's just a nice soft like
brown corduroy sure but it's called soft
brown their color called quarter or two
now that would seal off the ground but i
love this i use it as base color every
day that i wear makeup and I just really
haven't enjoying this color I went to
Mac and spend a lot of money and um she
kind of pick up all the new products
that's when i did my back home and i
knew i wanted these but I was like I'll
just get a soft brown you can always use
a brown color and I use this everyday so
like I'm glad I pick this up because it
is coming in handy yeah I love it I love
the color right next I have two brushes
that if you don't have these two brushes
and your brush collection Kate brush
makeup kids brush collection you're
crazy you need to get these oh my
goodness they're literally insane the
first one is my ELF and it's just a
small tapered brush Olivier if it's
perfectly under your eyes
your eyelids around her nose wherever
you want to death oily places of your
face with powder and this brush is just
so soft it was three dollars and totally
worth it if you don't have this I don't
know why you don't have this because
anyone who has even moderately increases
kid needs to get this because you know
we got a powder and this is amazing i
doing so i use a different big fluffy
soft bristle brush to pad my whole face
but then in attending that creases work
Maya bakeable smudge my maple fault of
my my graceful said in this vid star
cleans but I used to do that every day
so I love this question oh my gosh best
purchase ever and then I had a in
cosmetics brush which is an if roshan
will tell you buy this at Ultra I don't
know if you get them anywhere else
probably online but whatever it's just a
flat top kabuki brush and I apply my mac
foundation powder fix whatever it's
called with this or you can just apply
any powder to set and mattify your face
really well i love how flat it is on the
top it's not it's not the angled one
there is angled ones just a flat ball
around it's the number one 10 so I
absolutely love this it's just a puff
the foundation or the powder or whatever
into your skin amazingly and i
definitely recommend this i love it and
it really covers everything I makes the
foundation stamp your skin I just love
this brush it was like twenty five
dollars from Ulta but a little pricey to
totally totally worth it my next
favorite is a huge one oh my god it's
Anna greatest thing that you can use to
call your hair it's the nume curling
iron and I got the three-in-one Titan
Titan 3 and 11 so I'll show you what it
looks like
it does come with this pig handle they
have pink purple blue and black I think
it is and when I said this will excite
all right and then you plug in which
curtain rod you want according to the
size and like what size probably one
clip tiny one which is what I used up my
bullies I've always a few times but i
absolutely adore it it makes the most
amazing curls for your hair ever and
they stay all night so uses tiny one
cheese maker is at a shorter length
right now chinese one they have a
medium-sized one and then a huge one so
if i have my long hair back so i
probably use this one for big BAM big
beachy waves and then these are more
like hey Carl's anyway I absolutely
adore this product the corolla set of
eyes are insane and so happy I got this
but yeah it comes a little glove I just
love this kid where's look here's
what--look um so yes I was using the
glove and I still managed to burn myself
really badly it was literally with this
one like I said and it hit my wrist like
a millisecond and literally this
scar life it burned me so that habit but
anyway yeah I just love come on my hair
with this and I i didn't have poober I
