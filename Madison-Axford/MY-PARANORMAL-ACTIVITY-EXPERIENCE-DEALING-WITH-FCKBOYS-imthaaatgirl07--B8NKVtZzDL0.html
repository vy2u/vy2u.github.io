for the month of May my bad I haven't
done my cubicle enough I'm way too short
anyway I did a QA god knows how long
I love qh2 they're like my hair videos
to film down because they're easiest
crap but because they're just fun I love
answering asses questions I genuinely
feel like I'm communicating with you in
a way that's different than just me
doing videos so yeah um yes I put out
Instagram post about Oh almost a week
ago what are you and I miss I'm going to
answer your questions today so I haven't
put the questions I never do cuz there's
no point of that like looking at the
questions beforehand it's just like a
waste of time so I'm gonna do it now and
a waste more fun and let's get started
what are you getting your degree in from
college I get this question a lot
because it's changed so often and talk
to me people are still coming abuse on
what I'm doing with my life I am too
excited no I finally decided on my
specific degree so I am a comm major in
communication major with emphasis and
digital journalism and Media Studies
with a minor in English and an emphasis
in rhetoric writing so I have a bunch
going on I cover like every possible
field from writing to you know digital
to everything so I love it and it is a
very um writing intensive I feel like
major comm and English combined is just
I wrote like over 40 essays last
semester just reminds classes I was in
and I love it though I love writing
essays that is my strong suit so it was
fine but yeah that's what means you're
not loved it
it's College better than high school yes
it is it's not saying high school or
middle school or elementary school is
bad in any way but everyone is diffic
spear Ian sits but when it comes out to
a college is so much more freedom and
runs a lot more mature some good people
are still not super mature but you know
what I mean people grow up and you're in
your 20s basically when you're in
college and it's just such a fun time
whether or not you party whether or not
you have a million friends are one it's
just so much more freedom so much more
ability to do what you want to do and
options for you to pursue yourself in
and like high school wasn't that hot
remain those cool wasn't that hot for me
it might be some people's glory days but
it was definitely not for me and not
psychologists either but college is so
much more fun um and I don't even like
go out that much of it all so it's just
a lot more fun there's a lot more
opportunities for you a lot new more new
people that you can meet from all over
the world and like if you think your
life sucks right now or anything just
know it does get better I know it's so
stupid and cliche to say
and whether it or not route battling
with like a mental problem there or if
it's just like it's just like a sucky
time you know I think you're just like I
have on homework or if it's bullying no
well at any end of the spectrum it does
get better in some way whether that's a
little way or a huge way it will get
better something will open up something
will let up nothing is permanent nothing
lasts forever and it will get better and
that's what happened to me like my legs
just felt like so much better not saying
it's perfect now not say it was awful
then but it has gotten better and I hope
it continues to do so and it will like
as I just you know go through my future
so just know that whether or not you
like College the future is what will get
better for you your one post said you
were finally out of your broken toe boot
what happened girl my past roommate okay
she had a chair out too far in like our
room to her desk so he usually was
always pushed in and my toys pushed in
but hers just plot really far and we
like this freaking mushroom to walk in
or we did a Friday new data that Frida
NASA Department they got but we had
booked this much room to walk yeah like
that I guess like it was a tiny little
space in this one part of the room and
that's the trip of so she does she
rushed a chair pushed out her brought
out and I do had to walk by and I
stubbed my pinky toe on this chair and I
was like wow like over that bad loud ass
crack his stub okay and I walked around
on it for two weeks that mimic this
broken I wore heels all the time putting
so much pressure on my front like feet
my front toes my front feet my front my
foot a km/h hose and I think II was just
like dude I literally jabbed and so when
I heard over to the doctor it was broken
and I have my eye broken toes before but
this is just a different scenario and
circumstance because I walked around on
it for so long I didn't think was broken
chromosomes don't hurt that bad actually
that happened and like I had two broken
toes at one time at one point in my life
from our chance I didn't know they were
broken because I kind of went wrong on
them it just kind of feel like little
bruise I don't really feel like broken
bones but they were I took an x-ray so
yes it was broken after me in a boot err
casting for a hot like three weeks and
then I had a taste for a while and I was
it wasn't that awful of a break but it
was still broken from her chair and it
still hurts when I walk on it today like
a little weird if I go a little weird
I'll hurt how'd he get over an F boy
girl you should be with him
first place no I mean I've had my
experience with that before um you just
have to know that you're better off
without him
he's an F way for a reason and he's
classified as I as a reason I mean it's
probably a little derogatory and maybe
he's not but if he is like he's that for
a reason he's doesn't really care about
you that's typically what it is they
just want one thing and you have to know
that that's not what you're worth
you're worth so much more than that you
you need to find someone who like loves
you or even just likes you or cares
about you and wants you to do well and
succeed and be happy for you and be with
you and not just for that and so you
just have to get over that I mean that
is gross you gotta move on it's not
worth it because he doesn't know
anything except that he doesn't care
about you as a person who cares about
you click your body so sorry not worth
it you just gotta move the hell on are
you currently dating anyone okay this is
complicated because I'm always kind of
situation where I wouldn't say no but I
wouldn't say yes it's kind of like like
they're just person but like not dating

wrinkles and I'm like and you can suck

it was like incredible I think it was a
year - after that had happened maybe
yeah a year or two and there was just
like like the most beautiful note and
like my Nana had given me that and it
just like plate and I explore with him
like I tweeted about a while ago and I
was like I swear it's my photo because
like there's no other reason that that
would happen I was just like so it's
touching but I don't know if it was him
I don't know if I'm just like losing it
but I like to hope and think it's him
and I told would think he's still here
