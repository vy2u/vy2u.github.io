August baby or no my August QA which are
my favorite videos to film because I
love answering arises questions that you
have about me I love having you guys
find more out about me sounds kind of
conceited I hope you guys enjoy these as
much as i do without further ado let's
get started so I'm just can't pick and
choose random questions that I have not
answered that much or at all before how
old are you and what grade are you in I
am 18 i am going to be a sophomore in
college what age did you start wearing
makeup honestly i'm going to say really
eighth grade that was when i started to
think Oh makeup enhances your beauty it
doesn't make you prettier per se but it
enhances financial features you already
have and what you went to accentuate and
what you want to hide and so I kind of
got interested in it and I was like okay
like this is a cool art form and all I
did was where this really bright pink
purplish sparkly eyeshadow from urban
decay I'll have a co drifter and just
huge a huge decline of black eyeliner
from essence and then on the top and
bottom like lid not tight line waterline
like top and bottom I and I was ready to
go that's all I wore for a while a
little powder from covergirl on the
cheeks and that was really it and it was
a hot mess for a little then until like
senior year I finally kind of got my
shit together and and I still you know
sometimes look like a ratchet mess but i
think i have a little little bit better
handle on makeup like even you know like
the past December I still doing way too
much crazy stuff so its like you learn
something new every day you learn what
looks good and what doesn't I am I
outliners too thick right now and you
learn something new every day so yeah
that's when I started makeup how do I
get into makeup it's kind of just the
same thing it's like I just realized
that all these other girls were wearing
it and I was like I want to try that
that looks fun and my parents were well
my dad is really you know even talk to
me about makeup but I was like mom can I
do this and she was so nice as a parent
to just be like shirt do whatever you
want honey you know express yourself
which I was very thankful for it because
I know a lot of parents are very strict
with makeup and I understand that to a
point but to another extent kids just
want to have fun an experiment so that's
why I'm so thankful the mall allowed me
to do that I mean I wasn't that young I
was 13 and four
though yeah what am I favorite high-end
in drugstore brands my favorite
drugstore brand is probably cover girl
and my favorite high-end brand is Mac
what is it like adjusting to college I'm
a freshman in two weeks I what's it as
nervous as I thought it would be by any
means like I thought it was gonna be
nervous wreck a hot mess minus the hot
part but going there I remember moving
day it was kind of rainy cloudy so it
made it even more sad you know because
no matter how many flights again with
your parents or how annoying they are I
mean a normal person I do think will
miss your pants just a little bit you
know and I did more than probably the
typical person because I am so close to
my mom um but you know adjusting is
really you just gotta get out and talk
to people that's the only way if you're
gonna sit in your room it's gonna make
everything so much more difficult and
you know netflix is there for a little
bit but it can't be there for your
entire year away or how many you know
months you're staying at college or if
you're going to camp or if you go on
traveling abroad wherever it's the same
thing you're away from your parents um
no matter how far our clothes apologist
your home so you just got to get out and
meet people because everyone is in the
same exact boat is you no matter how far
or close they live to that college
either they're the same both return new
things they don't know a lot of people
they don't know what college classes are
like what college parties you like what
college dorms are like and so everyone's
in the same boat so if you get out Josh
people you'll realize that you can
connect with them and it's easy to talk
to him and communicate with them because
you're all the same and no one has a
higher platform the new unless the
upperclassmen so everyone the freshman
class is really nice and I don't know
maybe mi college at least everyone is
just really like hi I'm add a nice to
meet you you know cuz everyone months
friends everyone wants to have people to
hang out with and eat lunch with and go
to parties with so you you really just
got to make it easy on yourself and make
the adjustment a lot simpler by being
nice and talking to people and then
everything will just fall into place if
you had a life theme song what would it
be sissy that walk by RuPaul I have a
lot of questions about if I'll ever do
meet ups or if all of her travel around
to do tours and stuff and I see I would
love to do that obviously oh my god
would be a dream come true um I don't
know this is the thing I don't know how
much money I want to invest in that
right now unless my channel gets like a
little bigger like again it's not about
the numbers and I get that but it really
depends on how many subscribers you have
that well then influence how many people
show up and you in
you know because I might have a lot more
subscribers in st. Louis that I do in
Ohio or Massachusetts or California and
you never know so I don't want to spend
on the magic travel somewhere if no one
you know shows up and you know you never
know people will or not so i don't know
i don't wanna be like I'm a Chinese be
bigger but I wish I knew how many people
were gonna come and how many people live
in certain areas and then I could go
visit them because it's just about like
money and stuff really and if it's gonna
be always time for a known show up or
not so I'm always like paranoid that
like you're gonna go is gonna be this
huge thing and they'll be like no one
there it'll be dead you'll be like and
no one likes me I love to this question
which Queen do you want on all starts to
which is RuPaul's Drag Race all sorts to
oh my god thank you for asking this this
is life I really want to see Alyssa
Edwards obviously if you okay you
probably don't even know what to say
it's like happy more than happy but I
don't know it says but anyway Louis
Edwards I would love a Georgia Lana I
don't know she's gonna be all right up
pearl Katya Alaska that's really all i
care about four all-stars favorite
Broadway show that's a tough one cuz i
have so many so we're not gonna pick
we're just gonna name a bunch wicked
rent lame is rob lee Tammy the Opera
those might be the tops I think there's
the top ones yeah what is one of your
all-time favorite movies The Parent Trap
for sure that Lindsay Lohan one not the
super old one that was okay the newer
one though yeah why do you sing so much
in your videos it's annoying okay this
is the problem i have i've seen a lot
and that is part of the package of me
like that's my personality is I'm kind
of bubbly I'm allowed I'm like in your
face and I sing a lot because I was
raised singing and I took voice lessons
and so this is the thing I started out
as a Belcher I sang in a belter which
means like I'm not like I'm like ah like
that's how I was started out that's what
I taught myself in my room then when I
got voice lessons that's what they
enhanced on then I was classically
trained with opera and then I went to
pop so when people hear my voice to get
pissed off a lot because it doesn't
sound like I listen to musica theatre
growing up so I was like first day by
always saying the bell song so it's like
ah isn't this
they sing it's my favorite part because
you'll see okay and then I was trained
opera so it's not as strong as the
belting is because that is what i
learned second the third was pops that's
not even you know it's like she had a
late party girls don't get hurt can't
feel anything it's even weaker so the
strongest is my belting and then it goes
down from there but it sounds different
because it doesn't sound like what you
would hear on the radio per se people
get really pissed when I staying a
session the 99 cent product testing
video I so much hate on that one for my
singing and I'm sorry but this is a good
message that I need to tell all of you
do not let anyone tell you what to do or
stop you from what you're doing because
that is a part of me and I'm not gonna
change myself to make sure that you're
not pissed off so you can exit out of
the video if you have a problem with me
singing because that's what I love to do
and that's a part of me so we don't want
to subscribe that's fine but this is
what's gonna happen sorry that I sing
for maybe four to eight seconds in each
video that I do because that is part of
my personality so you don't like it skip
through it or checks it out of the video
like I'm sorry but I'm so sick of people
bashing my singing because they don't
like it like that's fine keeps the
negative comments to yourself remember
to spread positivity not negativity
thank you oh I like this and give any
other name what would you name Beebe
August I think it's cool it's my
birthday mom I so I hope you enjoyed
this question answer video with the
month of August if you're not already
