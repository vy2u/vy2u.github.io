I've never seen anyone really do except
for this Selena Gomez like special and
it was like tell us eight stories about
your like Instagram pictures or
something and tell us the story behind
the picture and I was like I don't like
ten times I was like that is the coolest
video idea so yeah I'm gonna do it so
I'm doing today I'm going back as far as
I can I think I have about don't even
know how many pictures to under or
something I'm gonna start in few guys
like this series hopefully you do
because I would love to do this and tell
you like a little background lost or yet
219 219 pictures if you like this I will
continue to do it all till we get to
where I am now in life so um I started
my Instagram probably like 2011-12 when
it first peaked her first began but I
like was a crazy like deleter picture
person so every time I wouldn't like
picture or I would grow up or whatever
or move past those friendships or
whatever I would delete the picture ASAP
and I wish I didn't do that almost now
like some needed to go but someone like
I don't have those memories anymore and
I would love to look back on the
pictures and I don't have them per se
but I do have the ones I have now and
I'm trying to be crazy delete a person
anymore but I will go through them start
with the first eight and see how you
guys like this and if you like it I will
do more of these I hope it reams a
serious cuz it's so cool and yeah it's
just really fun so without further ado
let's get into the eight stories behind
my first few Instagram pictures the
farthest back I have is seventy seven
weeks ago which was Christmas of 2014
guy Karen remember it's the first time I
came home from Mizzou for the first
break I had which was my first year at
college way too much nose
highlight on
okay so the caption is Christmas of my
favorite nugget in the world yes this
could show me my sister for our
Christmas tree in our house it was the
actual day of Christmas Wow oh great
explanation immensely no um it was very
warm that day that's what I remember
that's why I was wearing a like a
tiny-ass pencil skirt and just like a
nice little red top I think I got both
those things for Christmas I don't know
why I have them early but like I'm
pretty sure I got those two pieces of
clothing for Christmas and then my
sister just looking like a nug-nug if
you don't know I mean I call a lot of
people that it's just me it's like
something let's look cute like you know
we see the little baby I can't wait to
look it like that's what I call people
whether or not I actually think that it
can be a term of endearment or a term of
hate but usually endearment it's can't
you just kind of gotta listen to my tone
of voice like I'm like your and ugh no
it's usually always the chatter oh dear
let's be real um but yeah it's just it's
so cute like we look so cute and young I
that's when I was using like literally
foundation of a terracotta POTUS with
something called me before and how I
wish it a paper it's fine though my hair
was cut short cuz I got like 11 inches
or so cut off in the prior September
October during Rosie's homecoming and
yeah like what my I was also wearing my
our dog double-up lashes was like cool
so I was just like crazy and to make up
at this point but yeah this is a great
time it's a good Christmas that's all I
have to say about that I guess okay next
yes and Doug take STL that stands for
ball sack and nugget take st. Louis I
used to always say ball sack that was it
my favorite like for Christmas one of
these guys that live in my floor Mizzou
got me hold on just hold up if you're
under 18 please look away but they got
me a squishy ball sack like it's a gag
gift
it doesn't actually like balls inside I
died
um because I always said that would be
like semi Toby ball sack cake now it's a
tit I always say it's like grotesque
crass words cuz that's me anyway just
yeah I love it so funny um but you'll
kind of I feel like this videos
interesting so you'll get to hear a lot
of like what my captions mean a lot of
people don't hurt my captions and like
the emojis behind them and stuff like
that anyway um
OBS and I take SEO so I was not as well
as I can she was not good she's like no
and this was us getting dressed up to
the nines I remember this day I was
wearing
and my thick ton of foundation and I
didn't I forgot to my lashes cuz I did
my makeup and she did her makeup like at
her house like I brought my makeup over
and I did it at her house and you can
see my pink bra straps so obnoxious like
if you're gonna wear that dress girl and
get sticky boobs or a strapless bra okay
but I remember I forgot lashes but we
wouldn't have and we ran I think we
weren't like Red Robin this night is so
ratchet but we might - I think target so
I can get like cheap-ass elf lashes real
quick before I went to dinner but we
didn't have I want to take our picture
at dinner so like we had someone take a
picture at her house in front of their
cousins - yours is beautiful this is
also 77 weeks ago and then I got lashes
on and we went to dinner
that's fine I couldn't really pass that
lashes I like love them too much but
that's the story behind bag that's why I
look kind of younger and not as crazy in
the eyes because I don't have latched
this one oh my god I mean next hybrid
day to my room you so much girl I don't
know what I was without you thank you
for being by my side through everything
this was 73 weeks ago it was after
winter break going back to Mizzou for
weekend's his birthday um it was January
28th okay we got dressed up for her
birthday obviously it was in January
like I said but it was a very warm day
and um the original plan was one of our
favorite dining calls always served
raviolis like once or twice a week and
it landed on her birthday so I'm like
we're gonna get a raviolis and then
we're gonna get a picture with you
raviolis like this in her box and like
at the time she's a cat and we were like
Tim is so cute and we like get back and
wake up our friend who's like sleeping
and skipped class and the other side of
the hall to take our picture and we're
like can you get a picture of us the
better raviolis like this is in between
our classes we like got lunch you
brought home back to our dorm and she's
like and like I was like me one features
rivo leaves and then we like thought
about her like wow that's the stupidest
idea in the world like what a picture of
a to-go box with raviolis in it it was
my idea
it was stupid so then we're like okay
let's just collecting a picture was a
nice beautiful day sunny again wearing
terracotta pot foundation I had kind of
wavy crimpy weird hair and an infinity
scarf because you always got to hide it
the line of foundation where it ends
from you know terracotta orange to white
I was wearing her dress that wasn't my
dress um but yeah but how little boots
on righty boys we look cute so that was
what that is
bad bb's at it again at Sigma Nu
fraternity row chapter
okay so miss do they have frat houses
for charity houses like Brotherhood's
amongst guys who brush and I was not in
a sorority but this is my friend Ali at
the time and she was in one and I just
don't even look like that anymore like
I'm dying at that but I hope we say baby
like Bebe's baby beat like it's just
like baby I guess and it's a bad baby's
daddy to get it's just like no real
meaning behind it's just kind of a cute
ish caption that I deemed appropriate
for this picture so this is us in the
cigarette room which is where people we
weren't smoking cigarettes but that's
where people would go I guess the whole
house in smell like it was Russia as
hell you can see the rusty ass bottom it
was gross but there were so many people
the hallway and no one in this room I'm
like Ali that's cool it's gonna picture
you know if you got a fat party in a
picture and then I'm after this I left
and walked home like I stayed there for
like maybe 30 minutes and I was I didn't
drink so I was like this is boring as
hell so and then um yeah I walked back
by myself don't do that it's dangerous
and like not joking not trying me funny
there were few people behind me a three
guys who were follow me for a little bit
and like catcalling but I was like nah
my dorm wasn't that far from Sigma is
the closest for her return a strike walk
home fine but I got these little wedge
heels that wear McKenzie is like always
borrowed her and then I'm in this
little weak leopard shirt that was
Mackenzie's of the time - and I remember
curling my hair that night and I got my
first curling iron scars right here it's
faded a lot but yeah it was a mess
next we have bubble queen this is when I
felt hella like Glinda from wicked um
bubble queen was just like I don't think
I'm a queen or anything but like she was
like the mole you know she's like little
Queen witch and she was about was around
her so that's what I felt like it was at
my aunt's house over Easter when I came
home from his ooh go for break and I'm
way miss Q laughs which I love the top
was my mom's I don't know where it's
from and the bottom is j.crew what my
hair is so short and still wearing the
orange foundation but my little cousin
know I got a who everyone thinks is my
son I I die when I see that but my
little cousin oh I got a bone machine
and then the bubbles were blowing
everywhere and I just decide to take a
picture and look like I like head wave
them and I was like goodness knows so I
guess a lie
me you know just singing with Kevin
there so that's what that is I love that
picture I like can never delete it it's
just one my favorites the next picture
is I'm a milkmaid um I actually did my
hair I never do hair my hair always
looks like this aka and I like
grated it and then I quoted him over
that was just my level of boredom at the
zoo and I like did this milkman looking
kind of brave like Heidi or something
and I was living I put on this little
like outfit and I was like cure of my
friend at the time I was like we're
going outside and we're taking a picture
of me and she's like okay and I knew I
want to picture like this because I want
to make my thighs look thick the secrets
you find out um they definitely don't um
but I just love this picture because
it's taken at such an angle that's cool
you don't see anything besides me and
grass I just like my outfit I don't know
either of those pieces of clothing
anymore like they don't fit but I've
grown quite a bit I guess from slow but
I really like this picture and actually
I've had stood up for a date idaho story
on this you can watch it if you wanted
to video I did but um we hadn't been
talking the guy I was supposed to go on
a date with like we hadn't talked in
like six months and then he comes on
this picture and then I was like oh my
god oh my god
and so then we like talked again and
we're supposed to meet up and then he
left me hang in so whoops is power
couple but not dating this is one of my
favorite pictures of all time because me
and Jeff looks show like old timey yeah
in the moment and on my friend Roger
coming in it and I always remember that
she's like Barbie and Ken and like I
love it so cute we always called ourself
power a couple not dating because we
were like the people we always said I
were so it was like the perfect friends
like the people to be like we were like
you know what people say power couple
it's just like they're great together we
were the best friends great together
perfect people to to be together with
but we weren't dating officially you
know like we're not dating we're not
boyfriend/girlfriend but I love just all
my heart he's probably not here he's for
own doing his Mormon mission and Anaheim
California for two years so I can't
stand for two years but I talked to him
and and I love him and he knows that I
love him and he's my best friend there
will always be no matter what we go
through so yeah but this pictures means
the world to me last picture I'm doing

caption okay so same exact caption I
should like what a party or something
but this was at my parents 25th wedding
anniversary and they did like a vow
renewal wedding
anniversary it wasn't just like a thing
it was a huge party like they went to a
church we renew their vows it was it was
amazing
and I read the Jeff Tacoma is like my
date but not anything and he was great
everyone my family loved him it was just
the best time and and we look like an
old married couple which I adore and and
my outfit is like not bodycon tight
which is what I always wear it's like
this nice little formal black dress I
wore in the wedding ceremony thing and
um I mean he he was great you like talk
to my Nana and I thought that was like
the cutest thing ever I was like yeah I
wasn't there I was back like back out of
the church waiting to come in with my
mom and sister and he was talking to my
Nana like my aunt and just like living
and and then we had like a dinner
reception afterwards and it was just
awesome we danced all night yeah so
that's that picture it's so comment down
below if you like this like video type
because it's not my idea but I loved it
once I saw Selena Gomez do I think maybe
for Vogue and like this video if you
liked hearing these background stories
because people see a picture and can
assume a lot of things from it but don't
actually know what the caption means or
what actually happen or what's going on
during this time so they give us so much
watching it means the world to me if
you're not already taking them to
subscribe to my channel becoming first
covenant evil like mean the rest of Sun
here and but there were new videos
I post new videos every week thanks so
much guys
