like an empties video cleaning out my
makeup collection I've never really done
a makeup collection besides like one
into this twelve I think when I first
start my channel I was like I gotta do
make a fortune and I didn't have I had a
lot I didn't have much compared to my
normal beauty focused each others and so
yeah I haven't I don't have a super big
collection so I've never done a mega
tutorial or mixes real with a makeup
collection video I'm not ashamed by any
means I love what I have and I'm careful
with what I buy cuz I don't wanna buy
something then I don't use so only buy
stuff then I know I would like or have
tester I've reviewed um and some stuff I
don't like but you know mostly stuff I
buy I do like and when I have a
foundation I use a foundation before I
buy another one I don't buy like hundred
there for my collections not huge it all
fits this little bag so I could do a
makeup collection video which I've said
before and I filmed it a couple times
and it really liked it so I never put it
up but that's a lot of rambling oh my
god but um yeah I've never done one
because I was never happy with the
turnout and I feel like you guys would
be disappointed I don't have a huge
setup or a collection organization thing
so it would just become leaders in the
bag and my little pouch of products that
I own but with all that being said I
could still do what I need to start to
go through my makeup collection and get
rid of a bunch of stuff my sister took
quite a few stuff which I will not show
she has it now um and there's nothing
wrong with these products per se if
there is I'll tell you if I don't like
it or something like that this is just
the thing someone gets throw outfit I
didn't use the past year for my makeup
collection or if I but last year I
didn't like that per se so this is gonna
be kind of a long video but yes I'm just
why don't you show you this little
bucket of the products that will not be
returning to my collection it let's get
started the first part I have is the
Stila in the moment I shadow palette
it's the purple one this one was I think
given to me by a friend actually I think
I got for her birthday like in high
school my sophomore junior year it was a
great palette I especially loved the
color instinct which is it be in the
corner I hit total pan on that one
while I was using this but I found
myself not really using any of the other
colors all of them are glitter shades
and
I've completely mad and so I lived for
this light what about other than that
least just it wasn't the best pellet I
just failed it see shadows are kind of
not up to par with once I like to use
currently I love steel shadows like
kitten and stuff but this palette was
not a good collection of colors in my
opinion I'm sitting goodbye to this
palette which I've had her veil on times
disgustingly dirty but yes still a
moment palette is the first to go next
edge sight throws in here itself clear
brow and lash mascara high like a brow
gel my reason this isn't here's because
I used it up and I bought a new one
these are two dollars at Target or
Walmart
I have elfs luminizing and defining
mascara I think this is one or two
dollars from the elf brand at Target or
Walmart I bought this one I did my
completely elf oriented makeup tutorial
look which I really enjoyed in that
video I love most the products I used
but I realized I didn't have an elf
mascara so I was like let me go and get
enough mascara about quick at the store
and I picked this up and the brush is
just like anything like a normal brush
and I wasn't into this mascara it did
nothing for me I've never found a
mascara other than better than sex that
I love all of us care does kind of fall
flat or are just killing em to me after
I tried better than sex and I always
wear falsies so I wear falsies on the
top and then better than sex on the
bottom so this was just kind of a
disappointment of aluminized mascara oh
you know it's like that was just I no no
the next mascara I have is Maybelline's
and mega plush volume Express another
musta guy that was just kind of like
yeah I did like the brush was is very
big but I'm a huge hater of these
brushes that Bend um miss manga by
L'Oreal mess card did that and I hated
it he's been so so much I think it's
like a special 360 wand
I hate that because I can't get
stability when I'm trying to put on my
mascara it's like fly-in flimsy
everywhere and so this was a no no I did
not like this and I'm very very
particular with my mascaras so another
letdown
next I have a Victoria's Secret
when it's this loose bronzing powder in
the shade warm up this is a little
compact like it has the bronzer down
there the powder and then a boys do that
do you see that
bronzer flying out it's disgusting a
very very poor poorly constructed
somewhat of a Kabuki brush on top I
don't like this because the powder once
it hits your body doesn't stay there
it's constantly falling off and getting
on your clothes and your scarf or your
jewelry or anything that you are wearing
around this area
it flies everywhere and I didn't really
know where to put this if you put as a
bronzer you can never get a correct leaf
shaped contoured cheekbone line and this
is kind of just fall out everywhere so I
really do not enjoy this it's also very
very sparkly and the color was more
orange than bronze so this was just
always a mess every time I try to use it
so I was like bye next I have three
concealer versus my Maybelline master
conceal in the shade lights my favorite
concealer of all time I love this it's
super thick and you can tell whether or
not I'm wearing this in like videos or
pictures because you can see my harsh
under-eye circles a lot more when I
don't wear this I love this
in male areas and it's in this video
it's because I finished it up then I
have two Maybelline fit me concealer I
was obsessed with this brand in
beginning of the year I Ward the powder
concealer foundation everything and
being a year from Maybelline fit me and
this one is in 20 sand this is 25 medium
these are both honestly too dark for me
it was when I was wearing very very dark
formation which we'll see in a second
I'll bring it up but these were almost
done but I just couldn't wear this
because I use as most people to do a
concealer as a highlight on my forehead
chin cuteville on under I sit down the
bridge of my nose and these were way too
dark it was just adding more orange gunk
on top of my already orange foundation
the beginning of the year so either no
no I did like the concealer formula but
it ran out very quickly this skinny
little tube so I if I will reverse this
again which is kind of expensive for
nothing much product I will definitely
get a lighter highlighting shade next I
have a nail polish I never right now
Pasha I absolutely despise nail polish
and never wear it
it's from NCL a Los Angeles news and I
got this on a boxycharm unboxing a lot
of this stuff is from boxycharm I love
acetone to death but some of the
products don't work for me because
they're sent to everyone it's not like
individually sent to just you these for
these products like everybody says any
products every month for the most part
maybe chase differ but for the most part
of them it's the same products and I
just don't live for some of them some
use every day some of them I don't live
for this was one I hate now watch anyway
but can we just take a moment to see can
you see the green it's must be a nudey
pink nail polish and there's green I
don't know what's happening but there's
green in this and I'm scared to open it
so we're just gonna throw this away
because there's like weird mold stuff
going in it next
to maybelline fit me foundations now if
you have been with me since the
beginning of the year you knew that I
used to work very very dark formation
because I want to be tan every girl
wants to tan I think and I I really did
so ho yeah um it was during last
Christmas break into March April I think
I'm still wearing these but this is 210
um is that it there's no name yeah
210 and fit me and then 220 this is even
darker than this one I was wearing these
because I want to be tan like I said in
their great formulas I love the texture
and the consistency and these
foundations I love the fit me Lian
pretty much in general and in total but
these Judy are creamy sighs what I'm
getting rid of them I'm not I do wear a
slightly yellow tinge to foundation but
nothing compared to how dark these were
my foundation is more matchable now like
I've got it professionally matched so I
don't have this happening again because
when I was trying to say I had to put it
like down into here like down to my like
boob area because of the tops I would
wear you know show neck and my neck
didn't match my face with this so I had
to like paint my entire body
that's shade it was just not cute next I
have a box of charm product which is
from Monaco and it's a bronzer and I
love bronzers but this there's just
something about it it was very very
cakey and flaky and it has shimmer in it
I'm not a huge bronzer shimmer person
because I feel like instead of trying to
alter the bone structure of your face by
drawing on and contouring the cheekbone
this just looks like oh she's wearing
 on a bronzer um I'll do a swatch of
this for you it's a very muddy color
it's not very easily blendable I have to
like rub it in for an hour and still
there's tons of product I'm not soaking
you I'm sorry this tensor product still
on my finger as you can see it's just
kind of muddy it's not a skin tone tan
or anything and I just hated it over to
him put it on I feel like maybe Monaco
could have a lot more products not
dissing this brand by any means but this
bronzer was just not the one for me or
my skin next I had a fantasy makers
painter's palette I got this from Target
when I was doing my Halloween
fifteen DIY costumes which I love that
video still and the only reason getting
rid of this is because I used it for
when I needed it and now it's like I
don't need to use it anymore it's not
Halloween so the only reason I bought
this was for the white and then I got it
all Dinge from the red when I did this
bunny nose thing so therefore this is
going in the trash next I have another
box of charm it's a studio makeup blush
in the shade wildflower this just didn't
I thought I was gonna love it but it did
not pick up on me like it's a very very
fair lush and if I'm gonna wear a blush
I'm gonna go ham and wear the blush I've
rarely rarely wear brush I I'm dropping
everything I rarely wear blush but when
I do I wanted to be seen it's very rare
that I'll wear it so if I am actually
choosing to put it on that I want to be
seen and that just didn't pick up on me
at all like you can see right there it's
like not showing at all it just wasn't a
pretty color next I have a soft lips
little chapstick cube thing and I don't
like these um the texture is very very
greasy and shiny if you can see that
it's not get us one us balls much more
than that and almost like I don't know
it's so firm and these were just very
very mushy and if you press on it too
hard you can like crush the ball so
these are very weak and I did not like
the moisture it keeps my lips I'd she's
nice ball over this soft lips cube any
day next I have another fit me
foundation which is in 2:30 yet another
step
darker like is literally its wish alert
than the other two I showed you this was
just again during my dark phonation face
when I would constantly buy these and I
have to go through so many of these
which just have a little bit left
because I paint all the way down to my
neck so therefore I went through a lot
spend a lot of money on these but they
were cheap the most part so yeah another
Dark One but this is a Revlon nearly
naked foundation in the shade 220
natural tan look at that look at the
shape next I have a stay matte powder by
Rimmel I don't know why I still have
this because I haven't used it in over a
year
I immediately hit pan and there's just a
little around the rim so I don't know
why I kept this but I did for some
reason and yeah it's just gross and it
was a good powder while I had it but I
have found so many better powders since
then so I will not be repurchasing this
any time soon
next time at LA Colors I showed up
I love LA Colors it's a dollar store our
branch I think the most are cuz all
their products are dollar and I love the
blue eyeshadow palette I have but this
one in traditional I don't like I hate
all of these colors honestly I'm sorry I
didn't make sure with this and I liked
it while I had it but now looking back
I'm like what no no I don't like these
colors there's like ugly dingy Browns
and reds and I'm like goodbye
next I have an Avon totally kissable lip
gloss I'm not a fan of Avon in the
slightest I actually hate Avon I grew up
always wearing Avon and now that I can
afford other stuff I'm like yeah bye
so this is what it looks like it's just
a super super sticky hot pink gloss and
I'm not a fan I'm sorry I have ahe Faced
better than sex mascara I just went
through one this year so this was
summaries for some reason not put an
empties video was just put in my makeup
collection and I decided to throw this
out because I have a new one that I'm
currently using and I hadn't used this
in over a year and I don't like bacteria
or anything gross so it is completely
gone and yeah I don't know how long ago
I used this last so it's just kind of
gross I'm gonna go throw it out but look
how pretty it is I love insects
I have two brushes this one is an elf
contour brush I'm hoping they mean eye
contour because how the hell can you
hunter your face with this tiny brush I
didn't like this I found myself never
picking it up or using it so I'm just
gonna get rid of it cuz I do I have not
used this once in the past like two
years that I own this and then I just
have this tiny Smashbox brush which
actually just came to the palette but I
hate it so I'm just throwing it out so
double sided but both brushes suck so
I'm like I love the palette I hate your
tiny ass brush I have a lord and berry
eyeliner okay this is disappointing it
camera my snatch my Smashbox bucks my
bucks ten bucks and I loved it when I
first used to I used all the time over
my Mac or Urban Decay eye liners and is
very very creamy and waxy I'll give it
that
and I was living for the texture like
it's gonna go on so smoothly I'll never
have to like heated up at the lighter
except it will always be waxy and never
dry and that also has its cons because
it is so waxy I've never seen anything
fall out and smear as much under my eye
as this did Oh every other smear is
given okay am i you know Mac smolder my
zero or decay I love to death but they
will smear and
kind of crease and like fall out right
here and right here you know the corners
appear around your eye but this was just
everywhere and I was like that can't be
this cuz it's such a nice eyeliner I
thought and it was just a hot-ass mess
all the time so I was like yeah I gotta
go to this and it's a full like eyeliner
I'm kind of pissed because I really
wanted to use it and loved it but I
didn't and it was gross and it just made
my eyes look really really bad next I
have a body ography it's a boxy turn
essential eyebrow a little kit little
palette thing it has like a medium light
medium and dark eyebrow shades which I
guess can be good but considering my
eyebrows are one shade I don't know when
I'd ever use this one so I was like what
um but I don't fill in my eyebrows at
all so this is just point this for me
and I'm getting rid of this because I
never plan on filling my eyebrows and
also excellent shave them off or cut
them off like I did my eyelashes once
but yeah I know I'm not going to use
this next I have an ultra Repair and lip
therapy I actually had a really bad
reaction to an ultra Repair for stain
beauty product a lotion earlier this
year so I'm just throwing out all my old
products from them just in case I don't
have another bumpy rash reaction from
them I don't know if the lips will do
the same but it's just to be careful I'm
throwing it out I have a Sephora mini
little palette thing it has these like
kind of ratchet eyes shadow colors a
lipstick lip gloss I never used and then
blush and bronzer I did like these two
but they're not the best shades um yeah
they'd barely they don't pick up one
hand and I didn't like the other the
other things like it's just like gooey
like first-grader lip gloss and these
eyeshadows are not not pigmented then I
have enough blush this is in a pink
passion and I don't know what I was
doing with this right of a blush I love
their blushes to death but this is one
that I thought I could work but then
looking back in pictures it's like a
bubblegum pink and I really couldn't
work it it's just if you can see that
right there it's not picking up as
bright as it is but it's Oh bubblegum
pink and it was just gross and just kind
of child looking childish looking on my
cheeks so I am throwing this away but I
have tons of other blush mouth to mouth
that I adore I have another blush it's
from Physicians Formula it's a natural
pearl of blushing the highlighter so
this is a little pearl on this lid and
then this is what it looks like I has
these little bumps as
position formula products do it has a
lot of like texture um let me show you
right here this is the shade and I'm not
a huge blush person that's why I'm
getting rid of this because it is a
pretty pinkish polish undertone color
but I'm just not living for it I don't
wear blushes and if I do I have like I
said all my blush palette so this was
just like I've had like three years
nothing then I have an elf bronzer I
also got this mind in my entire makeup
shouro face of elf products and I was
thought I was living for this for a
while but it's just like it doesn't not
pick up on your skin I know you kind of
contoured this because it's so light and
it just looks like you have nothing on
and I have so many other bronzers
bronzers bronzers bronzers I prefer to
use over this one and I did get the
lightest shade in the Sunkist I think is
the lightest one but I have a mascara no
Q mascara I have great lash lots of
lashes and record volume Maybelline both
Maybelline and these were my two
favorites my together best friend Ness
curse forever like I wear these all the
time I wore these all the time being the
year but I learned how to put on falsies
better so I was like hi mascara I have
an elf concealer HD lifting concealer I
hate this this is what else product that
I cannot I cannot like I got in the
shade light I don't know if there's a
lighter shade but if there isn't it they
need to make another one and if there is
a lighter shade then I need to get that
one and try it because first of all no
cuz I already like this texture it's so
dark this is their shade light it's not
even picking up how dark it is it's as
dark as one of the fit me like Q 20 to
30 shades it is so so dark it's really
not picking up damn it is so dark
oh my gosh and yeah I don't like it it
didn't be starting them at lunch
foundation so I knew that was a problem
and I did not like this it didn't cover
up at all and I was really disappointed
because I bought this singly like not
for a video or anything just like I went
there to get this and I was like I have
a mini tube a shadow insurance I almost
bought the full one at this but I I'm
sorry I left you face I do not like this
eyeshadow primer it's so greasy I'm not
a huge fan over the K eyeshadow primer
but at least it's a little more clay
like I love
Paint Pots format cuz their clay like
and not runny liquids and this is a
runny liquid it's lip
shadow insurance look it
like not having to do this but it's like
dripping Wachter can you see that place
I mean there's there's like some kind of
liquid like water like fluid substance
in there with the product and I'm just
like I don't know if any to shake it up
or what but it's gross and I'm not
putting it on my eye because it just
doesn't hold the eyeshadows it like
smears them and it just spits I hate it
it's so gross
then I have an elf BB cream I thought I
was living for this as well but then I
realized I got it's too dark for me and
it's in the shade buff I think that's my
fault for buying a too dark one I loved
it while it lasted I'll say that it is a
good product it's not a bad product it's
just like I thought I thought I was
looking for it but it doesn't I hope you
can see this REI so much stuff on man
it doesn't blend as much as you try to
blend it still sits on top until you set
it with a heavy duty powder because it
doesn't sink into your skin it just sits
on top like a gooey gooey mess and I
couldn't wait to take off my makeup when
I would wear this because it just felt
so heavy
next I have so many cash hooks Hayes um
I shot eyebrow pencil I don't feel my
eyebrows anymore I did like two years
ago and first of all this is just very
very rough um yeah no this is just
mmm mmm it's so so not waxy it's so
stiff hard and it hurts when I put on
that when I did put on my eyebrows but I
realized my eyebrows are great without
filling them in so I don't use this
anymore um I haven't fill my eyebrows
for I think maybe almost two years yeah
next I have a Revlon satin eyeshadow
palette thing in platinum glitter and I
love shades like this but this one just
didn't blend for me it was so harsh when
I try to put it in my crease - Chris
Maki I it's a very pretty color but I'm
running out of room let's roll up the
sleeve let's roll the sleeve um but like
it doesn't come across that metallicky
it comes across really dull on my
cameras watch to die I have a covergirl
lipstick that I just didn't like it's
really old formula my sila kitten lit a
shadow which I was almost done with but
then dropped so it's completely cleared
out totally pan and I love co-locating
eyeshadow great great white
white shear sparkly shade for a lid and
my last thing is essence gel eyeliner I
prefer Maybelline gel eyeliner and over
this one because this one is not very
creamy and does not it's not easy to
create a winged liner because it's so
clay E and it's just very stiff and
doesn't glide on it's not smooth so that
wasn't no no I I don't want to just all
these brands and I love most these
brands but these products particular
just didn't work and then they kind of
showed me more things about the formula
of some other products because of these
ones like the one lipstick was bad other
ones work I found were kind of bad if a
foundation was greasy all the other
foundations were kind of greasy to me so
not hitting on these brands I loved most
of them like I said but I hope you
enjoyed this video of me clearing out my
makeup collection if you're not ready to
