just sent our best friend tag but we
went shopping earlier this night so we
thought that we just show you what we
got them all and do a little haul so
it's like a best friend hole um yeah I
only got two things but Matt got more so
you can start okay okay so I got a maxi
dress and looks like okay it's like just
black and white stripes
yes wrong and I was only $15 so that's
good and then I got a red belt to match
with it so it would be like a little ha
I'm kind of in my epic and it was only
like $5 so yeah that's good and then I
just got let's see I just got to cover
just like tanks - it's like a beige one
yeah Navy and like a nude color and
they're only 280 so that was pretty good
so I'm a character also obviously and I
got the jacket which I've been wearing
for a long time but it was really
expensive for my taste so usually by
said this on sale and stuff but this was
40 to 80 which is a lot to spend on
jacket but I wanted something like this
it's like army print with nice hardcore
leather sleeves and it just looks like
this has a lot of rhinestones studying
and stuff like that so that's where the
you know why the price kind of went up
has a lousy telling which really like it
I feel like it will go with a lot of
stuff it could be one as a statement
piece like this too you know and kind of
tie my whole outfit together or it could
just be like a nice jacket when it's
cold it has if er velcro buttons snaps
has a lot of mechanic things to tie
together but I love it and yeah
hopefully gonna get a lot of use out of
it before spring is sprung spring Good
Charlotte Russe I ain't getting in here
but yeah I just got two headbands um
it's just like floral and like gray um
it's like braided kind of
yeah so and then it has like a little um
straight like string of I don't know
bowl I also got the coral and like and
like a whitey or like a Flemish color um
had been with a bunch of diamond studs
so um
each was $7.99 but I got it for two for
ten so that was a pretty good deal
next we went to earthbound and I hadn't
been here before but this is definitely
my style I love this store Mac didn't
really favorite but I really liked it
and I got something which I've been
looking for forever and they swim in
California a lot but obviously I haven't
sounds like five and that being 1074 it
is the sugar skull and I named it Bob
and I just love it it's a piggy bank but
I'm so not gonna use it as that it's
just gonna be in the background my
videos decoration it has hearts and
crosses on it I just am in love with
this thing and it was super cheap for my
taste actually I thought it was gonna be
like 25 bucks because in California
they're usually expensive or but this is
only $9.99 and then I really like it I
really like this so yeah
I found a jean shirt that's really cute
but she was looking for me yeah and so
it just looks like that and then it has
the waist in the back so that's pretty
cute and I was on sale and I was only
399 oh I just got these cheetah print
leggings so just super cute it's just
gray and black cheetah print so I'm
making her wear some stuff that mess and
would wear yeah and it was 790 so pretty
good deal yeah so yeah so those are many
muffle I know it's obviously really
short but we only have a few things um
