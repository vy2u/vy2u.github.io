when you're 16 and then I was like I
will never wear that senior prom my
first as last only problem of my life
don't be commenting down below it's too
dark for my skin you know I got that
contour game strong this month norway
helped me appreciate my red skin that
you've cursed me with hey a long time no
talk o.m.g the last time I actually sat
down to film a video i think was before
i went to disney world and like after
that i posted flogs makeup tutorials
more vlogs look books and then
pre-recorded videos that i record before
I went on spring break so actually
sitting down talking to you guys as one
of the best feelings ever I'm doing my
March and April favorites together I
cannot believe it's May that I'm
graduating this month I am done with
high school this month so many things
are happening this month which is
amazing let's get into the video so I'll
start with beauty because I have the
most of those and actually found two
foundations over the past too much which
is amazing i hate finding carnations
because i can never find foundations
it's just a big struggle every time i
try to find makeup that works with my
skin but weird sensitive eczema skin
norway helped me appreciate my red skin
that you cursed me with but i found to
UM foundations which is great so if you
have sensitive skin I really recommend
these if you don't recommend these
they're great so the first one I found
first and it's the L'Oreal True Match
Lumi health luminous makeup and mine is
the shade porcelain light ivory w12 warm
I really like this foundation because
it's super light and it does give me my
normal skin tone so don't be commenting
down below it's too dark for my skin
because I know these two definitely are
not and I didn't buy these two new
foundations because people told me that
my fetish was too dark in my morning
routine video but I ran on my turf
foundation which was my favorite so I
have to go with different ones that I'm
kind of cheaper and lighter okay oh yeah
okay done with those comments but I have
really been enjoying
I used it for super super long time and
I still have tons left but then I found
this one which I actually rediscovered
because I tried it a long time ago and
it's the outlast stay fabulous
three-in-one foundation with primer and
concealer as well it's in classic ivory
shade 8 10 and i love it again it fits
my skin color very very well it looks
great on the I think and I love wearing
it's really light again it's a little
heavier than the other one though then I
found a concealer that everyone loves
and I didn't try it because it's the age
rewind instant age rewind a dark circle
treatment corrector by Maybelline
concealer with the little sponge on the
top I'm sure you see this 1,000,000
times before but I might want to try
this because I was like I'm not old i
don't have great goals out mean
anti-aging concealer no fun fact let's
go back to sophomore year this girl in
my class had some anti aging thing in my
math teacher was like why are you
bringing anti aging stuff when you're 16
and then I was like I will never wear
that she cuz that's weird but then I
picked this up and I'm in love oh my god
the coverage of this provides is
incredible I really is so so much this
if you can see I used a lot I do have a
lot of redness Boylan on my face but
this does the job at concealing it all
day at work splendors and it's great to
touch up because it's a little spun a
few slan I got it on it m is it or any
redness that's showing through in the
middle of the end of the day you want to
reapply this is so so great and it
matches my foundations really really
well as he I'm in the colored light pale
ho a shocker there I love this concealer
I never thought I would um I thought it
was for old people sorry um but I love
it and it's great the next favorite is
there Bell Sakura the Loreal voluminous
of butterfly waterproof mascara I got
the waterproof one which is like this
turquoise banner on me outer
in case which I love this brush I think
it's really really cool and I love the
shape of it because it has a different
angles and I finally bought an ugly
splurged and but see hoola bronzer I
have wanted a box powder from benefit
for so freakin long so I was like what
the hey us for large it was thirty
dollars with tax a little rough but I
thought it's the hoola bronzer how am I
a beauty grew up without hoola bronzer
but anyway it does have a lot of product
I work for prom and it looked amazing i
love the brush that comes with it
because it's almost almost exactly like
a Duke for the NARS eat a bronzing brush
except it's a little less firm but I
love how it's like a perfect line for
contouring so you can literally be like
dude you're perfect for contouring so
you know I got that contour game strong
this month and the last beauty favorite
of their mom is my duo eyelash adhesive
glue I'm going to prom this month it was
amazing you haven't seen my makeup
tutorial video for prom it'll be willing
to the dough and bar go check that out
because you can see what I wore to prom
I loved my dress I loved going I loved
my page and it was just really really
wonderful I had an overall great time
that's like my favorite memory of month
purim senior prom by first as last only
prom of my life and it was great anyway
when you're dancing all night your eyes
are sweating and you're just like wait
buyers are sweating no no you know when
you get kind of hot you're not like
dripping sweat but you're hot and then
your makeup skill Oh Dewey everything's
a little not perfect and your eyelashes
my deflate but know when you have the
duo eyelash glue you're gonna apply
eyelashes like here's my empty pack from
when I wore my elf eyelashes to prom do
not use the glue that comes in here if
you're okay well I lost that a watch if
you use the glue that comes with it you
are doing yourself a very very bad favor
because it will not stay on that does
not stick it all and this duo blue is so
tacky it's just a place so well I can't
even tell you how amazing duo glue is
because your eyelashes will not freaking
stick to your eyelash I wall eyelid
whatever the heck you're putting it on
if you put it on with regular glue you
need the duo glue
whoa glue and your ashes will be
perfection my last two favorites are
food because think is what makes the
port go well yeah what am I saying and
my food is life life is food so let's
see my food fairs I recently became
obsessed with trader joe's smell the
first favorite food is these pretzel
sticks that are honey wheat Oh calorie
and I had these before and they have a
creepy dude on the front I love him
because I love these and they're so good
and I find myself even like 100 of these
each night which is bad because that's
way too many pretzels and sodium intake
but hey it's okay their locale honey
wheat I don't eat wheat I'm eating wheat
now so yes I love these and then we have
my eyes are so cute okay trader joes
contemplates inner peace there are
literally dry piece snap things I think
this would they look like they're green
and there Oh farts and they're just
really really wonderful I've done being
vegetables kind of what I mean these
things that they were fried and they are
salty and they are really good and
probably not super good for you like
you're almost eating healthy you're
almost ate vegetables but it's like we
can't forget about the salt and fat and
frying food stuff I love them they are a
healthy alternative chips though and
then finding myself eating these with
things that were normally chips with and
they're very good they are salty but I
love them and they do have a like a
really strong p after taste like peña
not in yo p but like peas like the
vegetable after yes you get you get much
you get my drift you get it okay anyway
but i love these they're super super
yummy in my last favor I don't wanna
make this too long but I do have two
months worth of music I'm going to just
tell you a few of my favorites and the
rest will be Lynch and they don't
