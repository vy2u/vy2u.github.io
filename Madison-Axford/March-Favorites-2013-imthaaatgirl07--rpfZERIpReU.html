you remember who I am
just found myself out
heyo it's Madison and as you can
probably tell my room was 100% changed
yes I did had to change the color of it
I changed my bed and in the bed
comforter those weird and my bed like
frame I made it look more you know calm
white bright vintagey um old wooden I
don't know I really like how it looks
now um the other room was just getting
kinda I was getting a stick that I had
it forever I just I mean it was a nice
room but I wasn't happy with it and it
was really dark and gloomy and I was
like these colors are way too dark I
need some change so unfortunately I did
feel my room tour which will be up when
I get 1000 subscribers I did film it
with my old room I didn't switch rooms I
just totally redid it like crazy that's
why I haven't put a video in a while I
just did pre-recorded videos and my
Easter lookbook but um I'm just super
service new room I hope you guys like it
I still have some of my same things like
my Allen skull Bob back there and I
think suede chair but a lot of stuff has
changed yes this is my March favorites
i'm super excited that it's april ready
because i love these upcoming months
school's almost out huh yay so i have
quite a lot of things in my March
favorites video and I was putting this
off for a little bit just because I
guess I was redoing my room and it's
still kind of smells like paint in here
but I just absolutely love it i'm so
thankful and I just really like my new
room so hope you guys did too and
without further ado let's get right into
this video
I sadly only have one makeup product
this month it's something you've seen
like at least two and four times I
remember how many times of doing this in
my favorites videos but I just love this
thing more than any makeup project I've
ever ever tried and it is my physicians
formula bronze booster this is my
favorite bronzer of all time it was
around eight to ten dollars don't really
remember I've had it for a while I still
haven't hit pan this is just a beautiful
product I love everything about it you
can watch my 10 other favorites videos
and this is seriously like in all of
them but it just has a nice compact
mirror and I take this seriously
wherever i go i have this with me and a
nice powder brush even though it comes
with a nice portable brush I don't you
know prefer to use that one it's just
the perfect shade of bronze this is tuan
light to medium skin tones because i am
very pale it says it's just a globe
boosting pressed bronzer and I
absolutely love this it's the perfect
shade it doesn't make youtube brown or
too cakey and it just gives you a nice
healthy glow and I love putting this on
especially since the summer and spring
boats are coming and people are going to
start tanning and i usually don't tan so
I can use this as kind of a fake tan but
it doesn't look like a fake tan it looks
super healthy and natural and makes you
glow and I just absolutely love this
product I would typically find it hard
to you know put this in like 100 videos
and talk about it again again again and
again but seriously I can talk about
this over and over because i'm just that
in love with it i'll definitely
repurchase this as soon as i'm out
next I have a lot in the skincare
category um because I've been really
into products to help clear at my
breakouts this month and I've gotten a
lot especially during my spring break
when I went to DC I had I got a lot of
you know just like is its and stuff and
I wanted to clear them up so the first
thing i've been using are these makeup
remover cleansing towelettes from
Neutrogena and they are the night common
ones I wanted to try this purple package
the one because I tried the blue ones
and loved it um they smell like lavender
which is amazing and they just get
everything off they're wonderful and
they're a great part of my routine that
helps you know clear my skin and get
dirt grime and makeup off I love these
they're really soothing and soft and
they don't irritate my skin at all and I
do have sensitive skin and you should
definitely check out this brand is
definitely become my favorite drugstore
brand Maybelline used to be but I
started in youth Neutrogena now because
all of my skincare stuff is pretty much
from them I just love these makeup
taillights and you should have my check
them out next we have another Neutrogena
product and it's an oil-free eye makeup
remover and as you can see it's a full
bottle because I just finished up my
other one now these are a little more
expensive these are like seven to eight
dollars for this bottle but they do left
a while and this is just very soothing
and nice um and non-irritant on the eyes
to get off all you know mascara even
waterproof and eyeliner on the waterline
anything that you will have left on your
eye at the end of the day this just gets
it off doesn't make me break out again
doesn't make me you know get rashes or
redness or irritation and I really
really like this I love absolutely
everything about this its oil free which
is great because i don't like that oily
feel on my eyes like after um i take off
makeup and you know want to go to bed
and so this is just nice and it feels
really fresh and clean my products are
back there sorry next we have the PS i
love you hand cream from Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works I've had this for a while but i
never really used it because i've never
been into lotions um like every has
really kind of gross and dry but there
are getting better because it's not as
cold where I live but um I just wasn't a
huge fan alone they made my hands greasy
and I just didn't like the feeling of it
but this isn't just any better works
lotion this is there a specific lotion
just for the hands as you can see it
says hand cream and this isn't
definitely my favorite smell of all I
bath and Bodyworks cents ever created
smells like a perfume
and it just mmm smells like flowers and
it just really smells like perfume I
have a little bit now that I'm going to
blend it it's just so soft and it's much
better than just a lotion because it's
really like specifically for dry hands
and cracked hands and stuff like that
and I just love this smells really like
perfume and people might think you're
wearing perfume and you're like no it's
just lotion the less skin care product
to have his clean clear passage l10 and
I was looking for acne medication or
cream that a doctor didn't have to
prescribe to me I didn't want to go to a
dermatologist and have to go like
through all the examining and like
seeing what kind of medication I needed
I just didn't want to pay a lot of money
for it or you know have awful side
effects from something maybe that I was
allergic to or didn't know about it and
since this is an over-the-counter kind
of like medication thing its maximum
strength with ten percent but benzoyl
peroxide don't know how to say that um
it also has a little so so like acid in
it but not much um I usually use
salicylic acid and it does okay but now
that I've tried this benzoyl peroxide
I've noticed such an improvement in my
skin seriously I don't remember the last
time I haven't had some zits on my
forehead and I don't right now and
that's just really really exciting for
me
I only have one nail polish in the month
of March with that super duper duper
duper duper surprising for me because I
never beat my nails and never do
anything to my nails but guys are gonna
be so proud i painted my little little
nails this beautiful pink color from OPI
which is called la paz tively hot love
positively hopped and I'm not a huge fan
of nail polish but okay I would have to
be my favorite brand obviously because I
did a whole OPI nail hush collection and
this one was not in my um nail polish
collection my OPI nail polish collection
I don't think no it wasn't no I just got
this i think around Christmastime I
don't remember again this is just my OPI
is this beautiful hot pink color perfect
for jumping into spring and it makes my
ugly little nails look beautiful so if
you want something that just looks you
know really simple yet I pop of color
you should definitely check out this
color it was around eight or nine
dollars don't really remember i'm pretty
sure OPI prices are going up which is
saddening because it's just nail polish
people but you know whatever if it's a
beautiful color of the last while and i
love it on my nails I just painted them
today and I'm super happy with the
outcome I did two coats and they just
look great and super shiny next we have
food favorites on this isn't really food
the first thing but it's just try to
wipe done with microcrystals in
sparkling mint I went through a small
pack of this so i got the large three
pack one and i just love this it is
supposed to help whiten teeth and as
little as four weeks freshen breath
prevent stains can fight cavities yes i
was reading me back i always have to be
chewing gum because i just loved you
know chewing it and feel like fresh and
clean in my mouth and um this is just
amazing because it's more than just time
to chew on or just gum it whitens your
teeth and that's just like killing two
birds one stone you know it's like I'm
getting something that I like like gum
and I'm also helping whiten my teeth so
I love this company she-devil check it
out and then my other food favorite is
planters nut Trish ins I'm nutrition but
not true shun um it's like a mix of nuts
and it has 8 grams of protein and
there's almonds peanuts and pistachios
in it which are all my favorites I don't
like any other nuts besides peanuts
pecans of the staff
yes Oh 3 p's huh um those are just my
favorite nuts of all time the only ones
i'll eat and i just really love these
these are a bit expensive but they're
great little packs for snack there's
super healthy you don't to worry about
like getting a lot of weight from these
are getting you know too full or
anything like that like there's just a
nice healthy snack that's really light
and really refreshing and you feel
healthy after you eat it and that's
always good from a snack you don't have
to feel like you're like weighing
yourself down with like you know
chocolate or even like kind of chips or
something like that these are really
healthy and then nutritious and I just
absolutely love these next in the
entertainment category I have one book
which is also surprising for me so this
is like a super surprising month because
I got a nail polish and I got a lotion
and I got a book and this is nicholas
sparks safe haven and I absolutely fell
in love with it i'm on chapter for
something which is definitely not far at
all but I love books that are really
descriptive and romantic which he
provides perfectly um in this novel and
I'm just super excited to finished

love this book so much and I got it like
three days ago and I'm really slow rated
so chapter four is pretty far for me and

this for Christmas if you saw my
Christmas haul and this is the blu-ray
DVD and digital copy version and
obviously like I said I've seen this
before and I just wash it like twice
little past weekend I just love this so
much it provides more than just like a
concert DVD case I'm not a huge fan I'm
just washing the concerts it provides
information like about her struggles

her career her life her childhood her
family her friends I just love this
movie so much my favorite TV show this
