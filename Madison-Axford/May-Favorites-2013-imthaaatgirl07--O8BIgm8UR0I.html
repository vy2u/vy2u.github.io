it wasn't an amazing month really don't
have that many favorites especially
beauty favorites uh-huh but I mean I
found some really great stuff this month
so let's get right into the video my
first beauty paper is kind of random but
it's just an EOS well and this is the
one from the Alice in Wonderland
collections the blue wine it's like blue
raspberry or cotton candy or I don't
know I don't know what it is push us
while you can get it in a peck three
because this is special edition Disney
one from Ulta I don't know a lot of
places have them but I've used it a lot
it's just really moisturizing and I love
the taste of it I didn't think I like
the flavor cause like blue raspberry I
don't know what it is though but instead
of gross I'm your lips it tastes really
good and refreshing and i just love
caring soon the everywhere it's like
little pod oh okay it's really fun and
portable and I'm just like whoo next we
have another lip products because I had
this like weird like little dots on my
lip in the beginning of the month and I
was like boom what is this then I like
used a lot different products and got it
back to par because it's kind of janky
up in her but this is birthdays hibiscus
tinted lip balm and I've always been a
fan of Burt's Bees but I originally got
this cuz I thought it was like a huge
look like I thought this was like the
lip like sick like it was like huge
thing but it just comes out and it's
just like a little chap stick thing but
but it's amazing it smells so good it
gives your lips a great tinted color and
it's so glossy and I just love it love
it love it I think I got it on sale at
Ultra our target got a while ago but
everything used it until now so much
disappointed that it wasn't big but
whatever it's really great you should
definitely check out burt's bees they're
a little pricier then like us both just
regular chapstick because because it's
looking made with real honey I guess
apparently what I'm wax I don't know but
I just really really like this and it
really got my lips back normal thank God
so don't know if that was the next be a
pact we have is my yet mineral we're
correcting primer by physicians formula
and physicians faryal is one of my
all-time favorite drugstore brands one
of the more expensive ones but this
actually looks really gross like I'm not
usually pick this up and my mom got it
for me and I was kind of like thanks
like kind of like you know bratty cuz I
was like I don't want that oh my god
though this primer is amazing it looks
like I like a Neapolitan you
Napoleon neapolitan I don't know the
other ice cream is like chocolate and
strawberry kind of looks like that and
it's little like brush applicator thing
but you just like crank it up like crank
crank it comes out of pinky peachy skin
tawny color and this primer is seriously
it was pretty cheap is amazing i tried
professional by benefit and i did not
like it like at all and this one was
just so much better this one and all my
all the drugstore mascaras and primers
works how much better than high-end i
found and i just really really have been
liking this it keeps my foundation for
racing or or rubbing off and i just
really in love in this then we have this
ultra Repair Cream which i got for
twelve dollars from sephora which is
really cheap for a sephora thing and it
is um to hydrate your skin and i've had
a lot of dry skin around my nose and in
like in this area on my face and so I
just put this on and it also helps get
rid of eczema which I'm really need
because my cheeks are super red under
all its makeup and I just really have
been loving this nice little moisturizer
to put on before primer and before
foundation and powder and all that stuff
just to start off your day and get your
face really like moisturize didn't nice
and you know easy to put other stuff on
what the heck did I just say class
beauty product i have is an elf blush
which is surprising one because i hate
all flushes into I hate blushes in
general but oh my gosh this isn't
particularly a blush color because it's
more orangie color you can see that it's
more like it's not a bronzer though it's
not brown enough but it's not a blush
really because even though it is called
a bell blush just not like pinky or red
it's called candid coral and I was
really gonna pick this up just you know
because it was three dollars I wanted I
target by saying that I would never
typically buy on a normal basis just try
a new product and those the ones i
usually like the most and i love this
product it's great i apply after i put
my um bronze booster on my like apples
or my temples or whatever i contour
whatever i just put this like right here
I'm like and I'm dyed it on and I really
really have been loving this it just
adds a nice healthy illumination
illumination it just illuminates my
cheeks and help makes them glow and it
really goes with the bronzer that I use
so i just have been really loving this
duo with this in bronze booster next is
not necessarily a beauty product but
it's a lush product huh and it's
I think by the skin I know this is like
a really really expensive product i
think was like 30 35 bucks but its hand
and body lotion and i got three months
ago and as you can see it's really you
know used up quite a bit but i just love
the smell because was like pudding or
something and just i've been loving this
so much because i really want to hydrate
my whole body and my lips and my face
and as you can see from this video a lot
of things that make you know me like
more hydrated but i never used to like
lotion but i really like this one and
it's for your hands and body so you
don't have to be like um this is my hand
wash and kind of put it on my body no
you put it anywhere and it's super
smooth and just like I love lush because
it's made with all natural products and
so when you put this on it's just like
really really really nice and it's not
greasy it doesn't make a crease like
normal oceans um it just makes it like
really really smooth it feels all
organic your natural and I love it what
next we have food favorites and this
isn't food but it's just extras
long-lasting flavor smooth made gum oh
my god I load scum so much it's like
hard to find I only find it at my
walmart but it's like the light blue
package so you got like polar ice my
winter fresh or like peppermint I don't
even know but this is smooth mint it's
kinda like a sweet mint flavor I just
really really didn't send for food
favorites first well second I guess we
got skinny pop popcorn put my mom picked
this up from our local grocery store and
there's so many good things about this
it's like no artificial anything yeah
it's just like I don't like popcorn very
much but if you want to sit down and
like watch a movie or something and you
don't have all that greasy butter
saltiness you know sitting in your lap
just grab an egg this 100 calories and
um there's so many good things about it
like seriously let's see zero trans fat
um guilt indulge in this guilt eats
pretty guilt-free feel free cholesterol
free all natural dairy freeze or peanut
free tree nut-free gluten-free
preservative free and a good source of
fiber and i just wouldn't be really
loving this instead of like the greasy
popcorn like i said it's just it feels
it makes feel healthy up to eat and
that's always great in my other food
favorite of this month Isabelle Vitas
their public breakfast like cookie
cracker
um but I eat up all the time not just
gonna be them for breakfast whoa whoa
and this is the flavor golden oats and
then just come on these little pax's and
see 10 packs of for getting your good
you know viber out of this because
they're like little fiber cookies and I
know a lot of people be like that's
disgusting and like you know they're
really good you should give him a chance
next we have entertainment or like TV
and movie shows at first TV and movie
shows TV shows and movies first I have a
movie and guys are probably gonna think
that I'm a little cry cry but it's ready
two weeks i personally think this is one
of the greatest movies ever made and so
I Pixar I just love like what if you're
hungry like watches cuz like they like
make all this food obviously I mean it's
like a rat that cooks we haven't seen it
you definitely shouldn't cuss you crack
crack but oh my god I love this movie so
much and it's just like makes you like
not full but like if you feel like you I
don't know that sounds really weird but
like you feel kind of like you're eating
saying like you're like wow I'm hungry
now and she's like oh my god I love this
movie so much next for TV shows I've
been obsessing over netflix instant
queue like online or on your computer
and I've been watching all of keeping up
with kardashians all of khloe and
kourtney take miami i love both unfished

d and I love that show I love tattoos
and all that stuff so I was great to
watch it and I just like loved it and
yeah I just been really love those shows
I finish all the Kardashians though so
it's really sad and next we go in on my
phone for some songs about mom it's just
so easy for me I have two albums first
album is um I kind of reconnected with
it I was obsessed with it in like
October and it's hoodie Alan's
all-american like the small EP with aids

like obsessed with him I like
photoshopped picture me with him that
looks like and he was like huh like I
was like pretend oh my god was like
obsessed the picture was even real my
photoshop it I was obsessed and so I
bought his album and I never really
listened to it except for like no
interruption and no faith in Brooklyn
but I've been recently love an 18 cool
in the second album oh my god could we
take a moment for Demi Lovato's Demi her
fourth album before I kind of kind of
liked her but I was like oh I thought
she had a good voice but whatever oh my
god this album this help there's not one
song in here i love that once when I
finally just like Lana Del Rey's and
rihanna's unapologetic like when I find
out ones that I I don't wanna skip
something I like every single song in
there and that's so so hard to find but
this this is I love every song
