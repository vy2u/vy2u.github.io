holla I just got back from vacation I
went to Miami in Naples Florida and I
thought I'd do a Hawks I got a bunch of
new summary stuff and just really
exciting cool fun stuff and I want to
show you guys have on my stuff in this I
went urban outfitters and they give you
this bag one that you check out and so
you're really nice you know reusable bag
and so I just stuffed everything that i
bought in this bag there's no particular
order up um like I got this first I get
this second I got this Miami vs a post
no it's just seriously crying this bag
i'll specify what sir i got it from but
I didn't want to keep up the plastic and
annoying noise making bags you know I
tried to keep this big one um and my put
all the stuff in it so I'm sorry I don't
have any bag to show you but this is my
man i'll just tell you the story um so
first i went to cotton on and i was
really excited go to con don because so
many people knew tube talk about you
know cut not I don't have anywhere I
live so I was excited to see that they
had this in a mall in Naples i think it
was i just got this really really
classic simple and necessity of a shirt
and it's just this black sheer
see-through long sleeve shirt with
little color and is longer in the back
so if you want to work with leggings you
know would cover your butt or whatever
the rule is nowadays and so I'm actually
like this I got it on sale for ten
dollars and it does button even though I
don't have a buttoned um but I'm just
really glad that I got to go to cotton
on and i'm glad i got this piece that's
you notice necessary in anyone's closet
and i didn't even have a long sleeve
sheer top or like a really even a sheer
top of that but i'm just glad I picked
this up and it was a really great deal
so next from Marshalls I do have a
Marshal's around where I live but I just
wanted to know see if they had any cute
things or different things than what my
marshals had to offer and so I picked up
this adorable like knitted shirt and
it's totally like see-through and stuff
and there's like much little holes and
you know cutouts in it and has little
fringe at the bottom which I love and I
just I did I didn't have anything like
this and I just thought look cute as
even like a shirt with a tank or a banjo
under it or like a bathing suit cover-up
and I just really liked this it was like
14 99 and I'm really glad I picked it up
because I just love the cream color it
has to offer and I'm just in love with
this shirt it kinda looks like Native
American dish a little bit the next shot
i got i got from one of those like
souvenir shops it was called surfin
style and
I got it in Miami and it looks a bit
wrinkled and it's a bit of a crazy shirt
but I had to pick it up if you saw my
Instagram post um I did haven't pictured
me out at beach wearing this shirt but i
absolutely love an edge thought was so
crazy and cute for the summer and just
says i like to party south beach miami
and i just want to pick this up as like
a little souvenir or remembrance kind of
thing it was like fourteen dollars i'm
pretty sure which is you know a little
bit pricey for a Razorback tank but I
just loved it and you only go though you
know once or twice in your life um to
like certain places you know so I was
like might as well get a souvenir while
I was there to remembered by I said
where to sephora and um I got a Beauty
Blender sponge it doesn't have you know
the original package that it caming so
third away and like Miami but um I I'm
not too happy with this M so far I have
a swatch I was like five dollars from
old side which i love and i recommend to
everyone and then this one was twenty
dollars from sephora by the
Beautyblender company and I just heard
so many great reviews about this so many
Beauty groups had this you like put it
under water and expands and gets larger
you know put on your foundation and your
makeup on and when I put it on I just
named I make it looks ok key I don't
know if it was the way I was doing it
the technique I was using but I'm it
made me have like all these little dots
on my skin I just looked really really
awful I wasn't happy with the turnout at
all night actually ended up taking all
my face makeup off the nights that I
used it and I just went bare face
because I wasn't happy with the results
so i don't know if i was doing something
wrong if i didn't have all the water
squeeze out of it I don't know I'll try
it obviously more times because it was
twenty dollars but so far not too happy
with it next from a little boutique I
don't remember what it's called but like
this the thing I got to even come with a
package is just was like chillin there
sounds like it was fifteen dollars and
it's a hamsa ring if you see these on
like brandy melville shirts or stuff
like that it's like I don't even know it
is some sign of her protection or
something I think I like whipped it up
and I still don't know what it means
it's just a gold plated ring and it's
two finger ring so you put on it's so
cute and stylish I really really liked
it and I love the little cutouts in it I
thought it was cute and cheap I had a
vikes I love accessories and rings and I
didn't have a double ring so I was like
oh next from a trade secret I got these
sweatpants that runs over twenty seven
dollars and they're just pink is super
long and comfy and I love that and they
say love pink obviously on the side I'm
I just really love them they're huge and
baggy and big and it was just I had to
pick these up they were actually cheat
for victoria secret um you know pink
sweatpants
my friends had these sighs now I could
be part of the group and then um I also
got these gym shorts because I had these
great Jim Schwartz from a toy segura but
I don't know where they went I like lost
them and I'm really sad they had these
on sale for am I think was like fourteen
fifteen dollars and they have skulls on
them guys you know how much you love
skulls there's skulls on these gray and
mint green workout pants and I wear them
today when I went to work at the gym
whoo getting in shape and I just really
love them they were cheap too and oh my
god the Naples like strip mall that I
don't know what it's called but they
just have the greatest outlet stores and
those things were so cheap and lastly
from Victoria's Secret uh-huh I got this
pineapple phone case I absolutely love
it and I was trying to find it and this
was the last time in case like any
iphone case that they had the store and
I was like yes the probable one iphone 5
things are going good in my life and it
was 2450 a little expensive for an
iphone case but it does actually provide
great protection rubber she can easily
take it on and off I just love this
pineapple stem and the sunglasses and
pink and it's so so so so so cute then
from body central I first got this
camouflaged resp you know me I love
camouflage and it's just like short
sleeves and it comes up down like right
above my knees where ends and it has a
super cute cutout in the back I wore
this if you looked on my Instagram I
have this in a few pictures of mine it
was super comfy as mayor of this nice
stretchy material and I just love it if
you're going out to dinner with friends
or family is a bit see-through so if you
want to wear a tank or you know watch
what kind of color underwear you wear
because it is a bit sheer and thin but I
absolutely love it was nineteen fifty
and then also for body central I got
this and it was sixteen ninety knowing
you you know that I also love crosses
and it's just smack see I'm skirt that
has crosses all over it and it has this
like slit right here wait it shows like
when you're like legs and it goes about
to like right above my knee so it's not
like a super you know big cut up and I
also wore this I don't think I have a
picture of it on Instagram but I've
learned a lot of these things so far
they don't have tags on them and I drove
the bag so I'm sorry for that but I'd
surely like this is super comfy and
stretchy again and lastly I did go to
urban outfitters whoo first um when I
was in Miami I was in the ocean I was
like one with the city and I was all
like jumping in swimming with fish oh
yes but then I lost my sunglasses that I
got like two days earlier from forever
21 that i bought for that trip so what
kind of sucked but i went to
um iron after they're having a sale on
their sunglasses that or that they're
like something else is really ten
dollars so i got these black ones that
have a min green interior anja lining on
them I just really like how they look
I'm not too fond of when sunglass to
show my eyebrows I just don't like that
because I think it looks weird I like
with a big round and you know cover my
eyebrows but you know whatever works
there were ten dollars and I was in deep
need of sunglasses because the sun rays
are quick right down in flo rida because
the sun rays are quick right down in
Florida and then I got my rosebud Sal
over Salva I don't know how you say this
but um it's like six dollars is 24 but
of course I bought at Urban Outfitters
where it was eight they worked out two
bucks that's ok and um I really like
this I wasn't too fun on the taste at
first I was like what she's weird but
it's a great moisturizer and I actually
turned out to be like really nice and I
use it every day and I actually love it
now so I'm glad I picked that up even
though it was two dollars more at urban
outfitters and the last thing i got was
twenty dollars and i was looking for
this like kind of like a denim vest this
isn't particularly a denim like it's
more of a really really really really
really light like white colored wash but
this is what it looks like and it's just
you know a bastard has a nice detailed
ramp and as if you pocket and it's just
really cute and lightweight you can
throw this um overshoot your where you
can wear it as a shirt and i just love
it the only have size medium that which
is a bit big but i'll work with it i
hope you enjoyed my halt I'm never too
keen on doing halls because you always
get those people who claim that you're
bragging I swear I'm not bragging um
about what I got but I thought it'd be
really interesting to show you the
different things that I got in a
different part of the United States so I
