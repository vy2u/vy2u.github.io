skin nerve agents have such I don't know
if it's a red skin it's irritate skin
and sensitive skin or it's one o'clock
in the morning I get a little look cool
when it's this late are you from Norway
come down below I love my Norway people
hi Norwegians we're best buddies that
hey yo sir today I'm doing a really
really exciting video and it's my Q&amp;amp;A
it's a third one that I've done actually
but this time I just posted a picture on
Instagram and I was like either tweet me
or write a comment any comments down
below of this picture asking me
questions to do a Q&amp;amp;A Excite always
going to do a Q&amp;amp;A so without further ado
let's get started so I will start with a
few questions that I got on Twitter the
first question I got is from that
katie-cat girl
what do you do when you and you're
really close guy friend are in a big
fight and he blocked you on Instagram
from anonymous she said oh my goodness
gracious I actually had this problem
once me and my friend Jeff the first
part is he blocked me on Twitter but he
said was an accident I'm gonna believe
him because I love him but we have been
in numerous numerous fights and so what
I would do is I would just take your
time take a breather do not rush back
and do things not try to be his friend
like right away because you do need time
to think about what happened what caused
this was it you was it him and so I took
the time to think and reflect about the
situation that we were in and I realized
that he was not worth losing over this
stupid silly little thing you should
text him and he doesn't respond try to
write him a letter
don't keep texting don't keep calling do
something more personal try to find him
you know if he has a job or something
and and go up to and be like yo you're
sweaty this is what's up I didn't do
that because I did my apologizing
reconnecting on YouTube which might not
have been the best idea either but it
worked if he's met you you definitely
need to write something out and just
like take the time to not just be like
hey I'm sorry that I did this let's be
friends you need to take the time right
up I don't know I just feel like if you
write something out it's so much easier
to forgive it may not be but in my cases
if someone wrote something out for me
and didn't just text like ham sorry want
to meet up if someone if someone
I wrote something on paper pen and
pencil I always say this it's just so
much more meaningful I think that would
be much more appreciated than a texture
call next from at Amanda Bal busie what
is it like being a beauty guru I don't
know them necessarily get sorted in
beauty group I like to call myself that
and I like to think of me as that but
I've done like three makeup tutorials so
I don't really know I like doing more
personal videos I like doing more videos
that will help others become more
confident or help people on touchy
subject stuff like that and when I get
responses from you guys just saying that
I've helped you overcome you know
self-consciousness it just means the
world to me it is so I can't explain the
feeling is just really really amazing
just any comment or feedback that I get
from you guys it just means the world to
me it really keeps me going from at Lily
Butler 13 how is YouTube changed my life
it's changed my life in a million and
one ways but the biggest way is that
when I started doing my little sign-off
like become a fierce to come to diva I
don't think I necessarily really was one
like I like to pretend I was fierce but
throughout this process of kind of
influencing other people you know and
helping other people become more
confident I feel like it's made me more
confident and more fierce and more happy
with my own body and my own life it's
made me grow as a better person and even
though it may not have been like that or
started out like at the beginning when I
was starting my youtube channel or
starting the first covenant diva thing
um it really has shaped me and changed
me and I mean it's changed my life to be
happy with myself and not try to be
jealous of others are unhappy with my
life is just like I'm going to love
myself and and love the person that I am
and and yeah I can't really explain it
but I hope that made sense another
question from Lily Butler 13 best advice
for starting a YouTube channel um best
advice um put on videos frequently
definitely definitely I feel like the
more frequent I put a video some more
views they tend to get because more
people keep coming back and seeing my
face and they're like well my desk
might as well click on this chick again
and see what she has to say if you put a
one video and hope to make it big it's
not really gonna work that way um put up
like a letter in a video someone that
you don't think are gonna get the most
hits get the most hits do an iPhone case
collection video those are great what's
in my purse those are great look at
other people's channel
see what videos they had success on and
then kind of do those and the last
question from Lily about the 13th if you
could change your name to anything what
would it be
Charles do not call me Charlie either I
like do not like nicknames it's just a
thing about me I'm don't like nicknames
in my name is Madison
call me Madison my name is not Maddy
this house on my birth certificate
moving on to my Q&amp;amp;A picture on Instagram
this got an overwhelming amount of
questions in my opinion 57 questions
like are you kidding me that is crazy
and I'm gonna do them all cuz my not the
first question is from the Victoria
Friday what's your biggest fear oh my
I'm literally afraid of everything
my big spirit is probably either being
in a plane crash or
dying like getting second dying next
from cute world photography my favorite
colors my favorite colors are gray and
black and white also from cute world
photography how did you learn French
island fetchin middle school sixth
seventh and eighth grade okay
that is our middle school system in the
United States Tom and then 9 10 11 12 is
high school but I took French for three
years in middle school that was about
four or five years ago so I don't know
how I still know a lot of French but I
do I love French so much I was gonna do
it in college but I don't think I'm
gonna do it anymore just cuz I'm a
little late I didn't do it at all in
high school I love French it's such a
beautiful language bonjour je m'appelle
Madison said that um I just love it I
know the entire French national anthem
gotta assume that for you right now
I don't want de la patrie le jour de
gloire table a continuing tyranny latent
ensemble entailed a blatant on blonde

leggings and skinny jeans and stuff like
that over skirts she also asked me
favorite fast food I guess that's my
favorite fast food restaurant I neither
say bread Co because that's not really
fast food but kind of or like she also
asked my favorite lipstick color which
definitely has to be orange what is my
favorite sports I play no sports but if
I had to pick one that I love to watch
golf golf is just it's literally the
most boring sport to everyone else but
to me is the most exciting exhilarating
thing ever I love golf and it has a
special like place in my heart and the
last question she asked that I see right
now is my dreams and my dream is just to
sounds so cliche and stupid but just to
be happy with what I whatever career
path I choose in my life because I'm so
confused with exactly what I want to do
right now I know my major I think but I
don't know what I want to do with it and
I just hope that whatever I pick
whatever is my end goal I am having
because I'm so scared of doing something
that I'm bored with and just not being
happy and just being sad or lonely I'm
just so scared of my future but let's
hope for the best
let's hope for the best the next

do we act on my phrase for videos it's a
try to think of something that I would
want to watch if I haven't seen it
already a lot of ideas are repeated and
recycled like I think everyone on
YouTube does but if I come up with some
that's clever funny and I know I would
love to see that or watch it I'll do
that I also love doing makeup tutorials

tickle wires what's your biggest dream

kiss this summer honestly if we're being
real here hoping to get my first kiss
this summer and just have fun and live
it up with all my friends before we all
leave our separate ways for college from
- Lena Taylor v what is the hardest and
easiest part of being a youtuber by the
way love the videos thank you thank you
so much
I'm the easiest part about being a
youtuber is just being able to express
myself and tell you guys like all the
stuff that I would tell friends like I
feel like I have 7,000 friends and
that's just been incredible and and
being able to live my life in vlog it
and then you know have you guys watched
it and being able to watch it myself and
not be like a total creeper just
vlogging stuff for my own you know I
used to watch like you guys watch it too
so it's just great to really share that
experience with you
I love locking my life and like
rewatching it and reliving it and it's
just great the hardest part about being
a youtuber I would say they hate
comments but I don't get that many and I
can make a funny video about responding
to them when I do
comments there's really not anything
that's hard about being a youtuber the
next questions are from Lizzie Melvin
would you ever get a tattoo if so what
would it be
yes I would get a tattoo but I don't
know if I'm going to I love the idea of
having a tattoo getting a tattoo and I
wanted like nine last year like
literally ask Madison last year I was
literally getting like night like skull
dreamcatcher
Indian headdress words in French we
really got like having the French
national anthem written on my face I
don't know Bob Marley stuff but now I've
kind of backed away from getting a
tattoo I hate needles I have this much
of a pain tolerance which is nothing my
fingers are closed I have no pain
tolerance at all it sucks but yeah I
would really really like to get a tattoo
um I just don't know what I'd want
because I feel like after a year it
would be like stupid cuz like knowing me
I would be something really mainstream
oh I feel like I'm so indecisive I never
make up my mind and I wouldn't be able
to actually get something love it.next
she says have you ever thought about
dyeing your hair yes and I have like a
billion times I've had it red don't ever
do that unless you want to be red for
the rest of your life if you doubt your
hair but it literally stays in your hair
forever if somebody else something looks
red some pictures of my hair looks red
and that was like over a year ago got a
dead red I've done it black since then
I've got a brown since then and just
never go some white another one from
Lizzie Melvin if you had to eat one food
for the rest of your life what would it
be probably either potatoes or pizza
brah Jerrica sincere tips on roaming a
youtube channel I already kind of did
this but just post videos that you think
are very popular or you get you've seen
get a lot of views from Tina be RJ and
number one is there anyone you look up
to and how do they have an influence on
you my mom just because I mean who
doesn't live up to their mom you know
that she's always there and she always
know so it's best and she's been through
everything you know that you pretty much
are going through her have been through
it as well so it was just nice to her
there actually said if you watch the
road cop who is your favorite team I'm
sorry I don't
and number three would you ever cut your
hair really short no number four since
you're going to be a teacher which age
group would you prefer to teach love you
girl love you too um I don't really know
if I want to be teacher anymore I don't
think I do at this point of my life but
I always wanted to teach
so students from the Hattie Russell what
is your dream job my dream job would
probably be like YouTube like is that
everyone who does YouTube dream job like
just to make your videos for you I'm
summer Bell are you looking forward to
college are you gonna do sorority do you
have a boyfriend and are you going to
still be able to see your old friends
also just want to say that I love your
videos so much Aaron so you were so
inspiring and confident thank you um
Emily you for college
yes I am I'm again enjoy sorority at
this point in my life I am I don't know
if anything's going to change or if I
don't get input like right now I'm
planning on rushing and joining a
sorority do I have a boyfriend no am I
going to still be able to see my old
friends my best rapper Kenzie is going
to be my roommate I hope it's so steamed
I love friends my other best friend Jeff
is going to college at BYU which is very
far away from where I'm going to college
but it just really really sucks but I'm
hoping I can see him over breaks I don't
know how often he's coming home if he's
just coming home for Christmas or if
he's coming home for like other breaks
like Thanksgiving Easter I don't know
I'll have to ask him but I need to see
him I'll be very disappointing if I
don't see him
for a long time I'll be so sad but um
majority of my friends are going to
college so I'm going to so great-grand
serife ik the last question I have for
this Q&amp;amp;A and I hope it wasn't too long
it's from such a lightbulb moment would
you ever consider having a very short
hair who inspired you the most to make a
youtube channel and post the content
that you post I wouldn't want to cut my
hair short like I already said no one
really I inspire myself I mean that
sounds so cocky and I don't mean it to
sound like that but I wasn't like
inspired by one certain person or single
out like a group of people that was like
yeah I was inspired by them I mean I
watched Beauty girls I liked the whole
idea of posting videos online and stuff
and it's like I don't know I just loved
it so I feel like no one really inspired
me and I hope that doesn't come off the
wrong way or sound bad but um I knew I
wanted to do it and I do it was
for me so yeah so I hope you enjoyed
this QA thank you so much for leaving me
comments or tweeting me I always do it
through Twitter and Instagram follow me
my next we'll be playing after I asked
in this video thank you so much for
watching I hope you enjoyed learning
more about me if you're not already take
a moment to subscribe to my channel and
become a fierce and confident diva like
