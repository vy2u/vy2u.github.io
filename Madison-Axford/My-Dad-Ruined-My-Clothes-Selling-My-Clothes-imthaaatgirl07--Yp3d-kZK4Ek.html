some doing kind of kind of a really
random video it's like half of it
telling you about one thing and half of
it is telling you guys this like crazy
stories I'm gonna start with a crazy
story part because I want to open up a
sign funny it's so if any of you guys
know me you know i love these brand one
piece their norwegian jumpsuits there
one piece so the top and bottom is
connected tons of celebrities wear them
people on YouTube wear them and so I am
bought this blue one back in September
2014 and I'm not saying I think that
about one piece I absolutely love that
companies they're amazing this is about
my dad and it was time for to be wash I
got a lot of makeup around the rim of it
okay so when I was at college I watched
on my own but here my mom was nice
enough to be like I'll wash it for you I
was like I'll thank you thank you so
much to get to make about my mom was
going to use oxyclean a great nan bleach
stain remover ok so why does it say
bleach written all over this now bleach
which which which oh that's because my
dad one day decided to get this oxy
clean bottle dump out the oxiclean pour
bleach into it and not tell anyone so
now my mom is trying all these labels
bleach on it so that we know that
there's leaching this and factual
oxyclean all mine and is was right on
the front so when you look at oxy clean
you don't see any writing on it because
when you grab an oxy clean bottle you
think hmm there's oxyclean this no one
else would ever think hmm this is an oxy
clean bottle let me think if there's any
other substance in it like bleach no no
no think that because who would think
that right now when you see Oxley bottle
its hasta clean but no apparently my dad
wrote Clorox very tiny with a sharpie on
top of the already written oxyclean
label so apparently we were supposed to
be like hold on let me check to make
sure this isn't bleach oh it is can use
this No so my mom just grabs in you know
cuz it's an oxy clean bottle and none of
that you might know this was written on
it yet because now my mom marked it so
we know for further instances so this
don't happen again so we take my one
piece keep my knees one piece
like one to two hundred dollars they're
very expensive they're worth it but
they're very expensive so my mom sprays
we're all the makeup is and this happens
because my dad put bleach in an oxy
clean bottle what it's everywhere you
can't wear this so stupid now so my moms
like why is this smell like bleach you
know cuz wait isn't white instantly when
he put it on sign so she's like Trevor
that's my dad why does this like bleach
she's like oh yeah I put bleach in there
didn't you see it written Clorox on the
front she's like oh so yes mess is one
piece is bleach on it now and then I was
just like what what bank but I love
women's you should definitely check that
they don't know I exist this is not a
sponsored video by absolutely loved one
pieces you should definitely definitely
check them out yeah so I this is just a
story about how apparently my dad thinks
said you should check any bottle before
you something otherwise your stuff will
end up ruined that's not the main point
of this video that was just a funny
story um the main ports video is to let
you guys know that I am selling my
clothes now if you guys don't follow me
on Twitter Instagram you wouldn't
necessarily know this but I am starting
to sell pieces of my clothing uh pieces
some clothing some jewelry some shoes
bathing suits um books just certain
stuff all around my room on the know
there's nothing wrong with these items
obviously I would not be selling them um
but I am moving into a an apartment this
year for myself my year at high school
high school whoa no summary or college
and so um you know the apartments a lot
smaller than my house is now and or my
family's house the i/o this house know
that my family's house is now so I can't
take everything that I own I don't want
to take most of it so this is just
something I've worn a while or stuff
that I can't see myself wearing in the
future or stuff that doesn't fit me
anymore a lot of it stuff that doesn't
fit me anymore shoes I don't necessarily
need replicas and duplicates of things
that I have tons of already know certain
things that I don't need anymore so it's
nothing wrong with these clothes I love
that
but I am selling them i'm also selling a
few pieces that I still love but you
guys like always ask me where that from
and you can't get them anymore they're
like from show rooster forever 21 for my
years ago and there's nothing wrong with
them but i want you guys have a chance
to wear them since I've worn them out so
that's why i am selling some of this
stuff um bed yes i am selling them on
ebay i know i'm like oh so I'm an ebay
send I'm indie-pop so I'm Annie based on
them d pop d pop is an app that sort of
like ebay but it's a lot harder to use
in my opinion he base much easier
because you could bid and stuff like
that so i will be selling them here on
out on ebay they are still is stunned d
pop but don't buy the men do pal because
d pops not working for me not a lot of
people know about to pop and I'm not
sponsored by deep up either they don't
know who I am I feel like you have to
say that when you're a youtuber if
you're talking about a nap or a company
you have to be like I'm not sponsored by
them so you guys don't think that I'm
just being paid for this or anything I'm
not not being paid but anything um but
yes I do have different prices if you're
shipping in the united states are you
shipping internationally i will ship
internationally but it will cause the
price of shipping to go up so I don't
want you guys to be mad about that but
you consider that before you buy an item
i love you guys to buy an item because
i'm so cool you would like I'm like
sharing my closet with my best friends
which are you guys I'm so he's
definitely check those out I'm gonna be
