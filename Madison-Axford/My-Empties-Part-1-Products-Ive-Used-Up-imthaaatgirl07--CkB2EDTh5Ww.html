I've been saving up for forever and it's
my empties part 1 because there will be
many many parts of these because I love
watching them I love seeing what people
have tried what they did and did not
like and that's exactly what I'm going
to do today I'm going to show you what i
did did not like out of all my empty
switch I've been saving up for for the
past like two or three months it's been
a long time I'm just been thinking about
doing it forever and it's finally here
so yeah this again is part 1 there'll be
tons more parts because i'll finish more
mega products you know through years
obviously so let's get right ahead
there's tons of different things from
makeup to facial wipes to body wash to
everything so the real mixture of
everything i'm not really going in any
particular order just whatever I pull
out first so let's get started with the
video okay the first things that I see
are two of the clean and clear um body
washes splashes boost things I got two
blue in the orange one and um this one
the blue one is wild berry in guava and
the orange ones mango and papaya now I
got these um I finished one and then I
got the other one because I got a little
trial in the mail and I of the blue one
and I loved it and they have lived a
little bursting beads if you can see
some in the bottom and I really liked
the trial size so I got the full version
of this and then I got this one overall
I don't know if I'd repurchase them I
really loved the smell of them that's
really what drew me to them but I feel
like the smell didn't last it's just
like how the shower it was gone and I
mean they're fine for body wash but I
really wants I smell that would like
glass let me throughout the day and I'm
not just disappear so these are okay I'm
not gonna repair just them because there
aren't so many other um body washes out
there that I want to try but over all
these were just okay and yeah they smell
good next we have my cetaphil daily
facial cleanser and I did not like the
stuff at all I did it first but then it
made me break out I realized a lot and
now that I've switched um well I was
using P or a facial cleanser before it
did make me break out I use this and
maybe break our tongues and now i am
using um clean and clear like orange
morning one I think and that's not
making me break out so this one did make
me break out I know some people love it
some people love this medicated facial
cleansing line but I definitely do not i
don't like set off all products um they
just don't smell good to me because they
don't really have a scent and i just
don't like how they work so overall i
did not like the
at all and I wouldn't recommend this
then I have an alcohol-free toner from
Neutrogena I love neutrogena stoner to
death and I have another one I actually
did repurchase it it's huge and it took
me one potentiate but I did finish it
and I'm halfway through the other one I
love this stuff it gets off so much
extra dirt that you didn't know was on
your skin I just I just love this so
much and I recommend it to anyone who's
looking he's breaking out or is looking
for something to you know get that extra
little dirt grunge makeup off their face
this will definitely do the job then I
have to oil free eye makeup removers
from Neutrogena i also have a third one
that i'm on that i'm almost done with
new Jeana is my favorite brand to use on
my skin and my eyes in my face and stuff
like that um so I went to these they're
really gentle and oil-free and on my
eyes I love with it gets rid of all the
mascara even waterproof and I just
really love new genus um I makeup
removers but they go by so quickly like
seriously this lasts me like two days
well not really but it goes by so fast
then we're going to go to the makeup
removing towel at first I have nitrogen
has make a river cleansing towelettes um
in hydrating and it's the teal one and i
got these mainly because my skin is
really dried out and I was like what is
wrong I'm gonna get hydrating wipes and
these really did the job of making my
skin rumor feel refreshed and it really
did get my skin moisture and it made my
skin just healthier and not as dry
because it was getting really dry for
some reason so these did do the job if
you're looking for something to help
your dry skin definitely check out these
been used to do that I really enjoyed
these and they smell too good then I
tried simple sensitive skin cleansing
facial wipes did not like these at all
they were really dried out and I feel
like I had to like scrub my face in
order to get my makeup off because it
was really like they weren't wet or
moist and I couldn't get any makeup off
so I did not like these I'm trying
different simple ones right now should I
I'm about halfway through halfway
through the back and I'm enjoying them
but do these the original kind I did not
like it all um no I didn't like them and
then we had the worst ones ever the
makeup remover cundertol it's by the
up-and-up target brain because for some
reason I thought I wasn't gonna say now
spend a little extra to one or two
dollars for makeup remover talents and
instead just get the target brand they
were awful they made me break out they
made my skin really really read again
because they were really dry the simple
ones were drive but they didn't really
leave my skin feeling red like scratchy
this one did
it made my skin feel disgusting and I
was so thankful once I was done with
these oh my god they were awful i do not
recommend those to anyone they are
disgusting then i had the original
makeup remover cleansing towelettes um
from Neutrogena just like my story pack
of them but I only kept this one because
I could tell you that i tried three of
these i love them they're classic I mean
there's nothing really special trip it's
not to hydrate your skin it's not to you
know make you like stop or ham this is
just the original one it just does the
job just make a ball so I like them but
I mean there's so many great other ones
to try um for like your specific skin
problems that I mean these are fine if
you're looking for like just whatever
but I don't know I like once I have a
specific thing that they do and such a
more fun to me then we have the UM
original fresh wet cleansing k let's buy
ponds I just really pick this up so I
want to try a variety of different
brands I'm I like trains I was always I
was sad because there's like 15 of them
rather than like the other ones all have
25 so it was 10 less they were fine I
really liked the little indents in the
UM that I had in the cloth I don't know
I just like that for some reason I hope
my mascara off better but I just really
liked these I just wish it came with
more and I'd never tried ponds brand for
so this was a success for ponds and then
finally we had the another neutrogena
one and it's the night calming one this
one felt amazing it didn't do much I
wasn't like hunter calm now but I mean
it really smelled good it was like
lavender and chamomile that's what a
kind of smelt like and so um yes I just
did the same thing as like the other
ones so I like Jim it the new trainer
months all work the same really they
just except for the high during ones but
they just smell different and they smell
all really good so that's why I like
England you should you know ones because
you can always trust me to Gino cuz
that's my favorite brand next I have a
Beauty Blender this is one from Ulta so
it's not the beauty blender or the pink
one from Sephora and I just felt like
after a while since this wasn't like
five bucks I should just get rid of it I
hadn't been keeping up on the clean on
cleaning it like I do with my other
Beauty Blender that's twenty dollars
from Sephora um and it was just kind of
getting hard and crusty and disgusting
so I was like I need to get rid of this
um it did the job while I had it and it
works fine and great but I mean it's
time to move on and I don't know if I'm
gonna report just one of these right
away because um like I am having my
other one now and I am keeping up with
cleaning it every day so that doesn't
spread acne or get dirty or crusty but
yes this one was fine it was five
dollars of your local ulta
just didn't want to use the dang works
it was kind of gross next I tried the
outlast stay fabulous three-in-one
covergirl foundation and there's it
looks like there's 10th left but I swear
there isn't I really scooped it all out
I didn't really enjoy this as much as I
thought I would it was being raved about
here on youtube so of course I had to
get it and his mess sorry but I didn't
really like this it came out really pale
so i thought i had to add tons of
bronzer to make myself look like not a
ghost um but then after like an hour to
after an oxidized and stuff it turned
really orange and crusty i'm using
christie a lot but like a lot of these
products did that and i do not like this
at all um I was really upset because I
thought I was gonna love this like
everyone else but um no I just I didn't
like it I did not like this product I
did want to finish it because it was
like ten dollars so i pushed through and
finished it but I would not reverse that
then we have my lovely bronze booster
which I'm not completely finished with
it because there's a little around the
rim but as you can see I totally hit pan
and I'm gonna continue to scoop it be
hate little amount that's left out this
has been with me since i started my
youtube channel basically i love to
death it's been in like a hundred
thousand my videos almost in all my
favorites videos and i love it um i'm
gonna buy an another one probably it's
just it's so expensive I am I on sale
frayed bucks but it's like really
expensive and it did last me a long time
I just since I'm using a BB cream right
now I don't need a bronzer so I haven't
been using this in a while but when I do
start using foundation again like the
winter and stuff I will resort back to
using this and I'll buy another one then
I went through my new journey of skin
clearing foundation phase where i
actually had five least I threw two away
because I didn't know the about the
empties tag um before like before I
start throwing away so I have this I'm
in the shade 10 classic ivory um and I
just I loved this seriously I had five
of these I've never had a foundation
that long the only downside is that it's
a super tiny bottle but I mean you get
over that because it does work amazing
it didn't make me a little orange but I
liked that in the UM winter because you
know upwards pale but I really love this
again I had I went through five of them
that's 12 hours that's like sixty
dollars on foundation and I loved every
second of it this was really great
foundation for me so again it's the news
Eunice King clearing one oil free with
salicylic acid in it and I will go back
to this once it hits wintertime and I
get away from that BB cream stage that
I'm in but i loved this to death and
yeah i wish i had the two other ones to
show you
looks so much more dramatic if you have
all of them that you used I really went
through those quickly and I loved it
next I have a professional sample and
I'm which I tried after I had the whole
tube I hate this product i will never
buy this again i don't recommend this to
anyone Porefessional was probably the
biggest letdown the biggest product I
regret buying ever because I wanted the
snow by late and it was thirty dollars
for such a little tube it was just made
a brood nervous but okay this is a
benefit product I love benefit usually
lemonade's my favorite thing ever I just
hate professional and I was looking for
a good primer I eventually found it in
the all my DNA one but seriously I
cannot do professional it was Gracie it
just my makeup slid off it did nothing
and I I don't like it I'm sorry benefit
I love you but this was thirty dollars
for little tube and it absolutely sucked
I hated it it did nothing it was grumps
then i have this voluminous false fiber
lashes by lore'l mascara and i will
repurchase this probably eventually i
like to try a few mascaras and then go
back to the ones i liked after that but
it's in the gold too i always thought
this was a million lashes line i think i
said that in like five in my videos
buddy I don't think it is I really don't
think it is anyway it has some mascara
grunge right there I love this it's
really good at doing bottom lashes and
really separating them because the brush
is so long I just really really enjoyed
this mascara I kind of picked it up in a
whim I was just like wow this one
because I thought it was a million
lashes one it wasn't but I really did
enjoy this and i love it and i will
eventually repurchase it for sure then i
have revlon photoready BB cream this is
again when i was one of my through my BB
cream stage and it looks like i still
have tons but i really don't um this is
kind of like this one I hated it um but
I did push through and finish it and may
my skin so orange and greasy so greasy
like if you touched my face it looked
like it was wet this is just uh just
shade this so I just hate this so much
this is the lightest shade and 010 light
pale yet it just made me so orange and
brown I was like this is what is this I
do not like it was so way too heavy and
greasy for a BB cream it's Gracie ER
than like it's like heavier angers here
than a foundation I hated this
definitely one of my least favorite BB
creams I've ever tried by far actually
it was the least favorite BB cream every
time you wrong oh then we have my
favorite mascara of all time great lash
lots of lashes by Maybelline
and I went through two tubes of this I
love it to death and it just separates
your lashes it's so tiny and cheap it's
like four dollars at you know your local
drug store or walmart target and it
works freaking amazing it's incredible
how amazing this works I can't recommend
it enough it's like my bronze booster
and you should definitely definitely
definitely buy this it's four dollars
the chip is the cigar you can find yet
it's the best master that you can find I
just dropped it then I have some little
samples which I didn't like any of them
I have philosophies philosophies
philosophies I hope philosophies miracle
worker and Rev revitalift miracle boys
drawling anti-aging things so again I
didn't need them but I got him from
Sephora and went to try and didn't like
any of them again I don't really have
wrinkles so I can't really ouch for them
whether or not i like them because i
don't have anything you know to actually
try them on like I'm not saying like
bragging that I don't have wrinkles cuz
I do have like a lot of smile lines and
like oh like all these weird lines on my
face like in my for heads up play huh I
could add but again these that can't be
fixed with these and I just didn't like
them they didn't really do anything
special they were just kind of greasy in
I don't know there's an annoying then I
have an EOS ball this is the a Disney
Alice in Wonderland blue one I don't
know what it is blueberry I don't know
but it got to the point where it was so
little and gross I just didn't want to
use it anymore you always falls get to
the point where it's like you don't even
want to try anymore cuz there's so many
other great lips like moisturizer and
glosses out there and this is so tiny
and you know it just turn really gross
after being around my makeup for so long
I loved it us wells are amazing and
great but it was time for a new thing so
i loved it i recommended this labor I
thought I'd hate but I'm sectional yummy
it was good unless I just have some I
things first I have urban decay
eyeshadow primer potion in the original
one and this just came with my naked
palette for Christmas I used it really
quickly I already had the big tube of
this like before I even start my youtube
channel and I loved it i'm on the
original sin one but I don't wear
eyeshadow really at all right now in my
life so like I didn't use this and it
worked great Urban Decay eyeshadow
primers are the most amazing thing ever
i recommended them to my friends my mom
so many people love them and yeah so i
recommend it to anyone it's just i had
to include that little thing that i've
finished but I on my favorite eyeliner
essence long lasting I pencil it's like
not a pencil or gel or liquid is just
like a roll up one so I don't know what
that
it's just kind of waxy oh nasty um I
love this this like my fifth one I
finished a bit and I'm on another one
right now I absolutely love it and I
wouldn't ever go to a different eyeliner
pencil at this point of my life because
it works so well on my waterline and
it's like seriously chewed all arts Max
and I my extra large sills booster from
Lancome it's my eyelash primer which I
love to death I got for Christmas and I
know you're not supposed to keep
mascaras for longer than like three to
six months I didn't keep it seven and I
used it every day so it probably isn't
good but it's totally out now it was a
white primer it worked so well and I
really want to get another one but it is
like twenty-five dollars so i don't know
if i'm gonna get any time soon just
because i'm doing ok with mascara right
now without a primer but i love this it
really like replenishes your lashes
makes them you know look thicker and
actually like helps them grow which I
love and it's my L'Oreal i'd definitely
recommend it to anyone I did and my mom
and friends also got that product Oh
awesome then I was really old Revlon
Colorstay liquid liner and that my mom
gave me I was like my first eyeliner and
it was the liquid so I learned liquid
eyeliner pretty early that's I mean I
think I'm pretty ok sorry that didn't
focus by anyway I think I'm pretty good
at it because I did start such early age
but this brush was so thick and not even
point he was just like a blob I did way
too thick of a line sometimes but that's
okay well forget medicine for that
awkward say should really think eyeliner
I was testing it i was trying it and i
was learning how to do I later and
that's the first mega product that I
really ever had oh look another essence
long lasting eyeliner pencils so here's
another one I throw in there didn't see
that hey I have elf wet gloss lash and
brow I have the Great Lash eyebrow gel
now which I love this one was the dollar
is okay um I used it all but I didn't
really like it it made my eyebrows
really really white it's like gross and
like sticky and no no didn't like this
it was dollar though not a big loss I
hope you enjoyed my empties video that's
all I have to show right now but this is
my part 1 but this is my part 1 so
you'll be seeing a part 2 somewhere in
the future not anytime soon because it's
all I've finished right now been the
future you will see that so I can throw
all this crap away now and thank you for
