thing ever I went in my skin's really
really janked it's just my skin is
jacked up sometimes so picky with mega
product anyway those were great the
lightest shade because she's like it
Nick it's gonna be dark for your skin
and I was like what I want to try it
heyo so today I'm doing an empties video
number two because this is my second
time doing an empties video I have a
bunch of stuff especially face makeup
remover wipes again but anyway i'm super
excited to do these videos that love
watching that and i'm giving my honest
opinion in reaction to them and if
whether or not i like to him whether or
not a repurchase though both intro was
really fast sorry any slowdowns anyway
without further ado let's get into my
empties take two so start out with make
wipes cuz i seem to have the most of
those um first-ever this really random
brand which I don't know where they're
necessarily from or what brand they are
uh-huh then I and gave me this for my
birthday in August and I used them it
came in a pack of like to so we have the
morning blast um face cleansing wipes
with grapefruit oil and then the night
coming lunch with vanilla extract and
these smell pretty good you know I
especially love the orange ones cuz a
really fresh earth that great for once
but they look like orange juice orange
packaging huh the vanilla was okay but I
really am not a fan of vanilla scents
okay it looks like you're still waiting
here like your um I just don't really
like vanilla East sense it's not the
kind of girl I am um but these were okay
they were more of like just like face
moisturizer also felt like they didn't
really take up all the grunge and makeup
and stuff that I had on my face though I
want to repurchase these I don't even
know where she got these um they didn't
make me break out our thing they were
pretty good you know um give him my skin
like nice and dewy look but it didn't
really get off the makeup that well I
don't know if these are necessarily for
like I makeup and stuff because they did
not get those off but I unfortunately
don't look how many there by the kind of
strange nightcall morning blast oh wait
global beauty care maybe it's that
that might be it i don't know anyway so
these were okay I mean I'm not gonna
repurchase them but they're just makeup
wipe so you can never have too many of
those next I have makeup what the hell
was your feather on this make remover
wipes from gap and these did the job
good of getting makeup off however
around my eyes they stung so badly cuz I
just like with a moment you know
thinking it was normal white so I taken
the face makeup they worked great um and
they're only 399 but um when I would get
to my eyes I'd be like this message did
I'm doing so oh my oh my goodness and
they would just sting and I'm thereafter
like pour water and flush water into my
eye because it would hurt so badly I
didn't I might contacts in there just
like they would hurt but no didn't good
if you actually got face makeup if
you're gonna do your eye makeup use
something else do not use these wipes um
they were nice and cheap but they hurt
really bad around my eyes next I have
another I think I had money's in my last
video but it's um some of the ponds wet
cleansing towelettes with vitamin E
these are okay i really like the texture
on the wipes the little dots day I feel
like they get more off but again nothing
special to him the scent it's just like
whatever I don't know hydrated purchase
them my mom these for me um when I was
out of them so I didn't get them myself
I just picked these up but um they're
okay I'm not gonna repurchase them
because there's so many other brands I
like better but whatever sorry I feel
like my look face was like half in the
light half out sorry about that then i
have 0 2 um sensitive skin experts
simple brand oil balancing cleansing
wipe this is the darker green one and i
didn't know i had two of these um
they're okay again these are like I just
thought someone ran are like a little
dried out i feel like i said i'm in last
video but they're not very wet so like
but i try to get like my makeup off I
feel like I really just scrub and it
makes my face even more bread then it
everybody is um because they aren't that
damp so I'm trying to get it off I'm
like they get it off fine but I was
really gonna put like water on them or
something she's pretty like or try it
out but they're not but they feel like
they are so those are all the makeup
wipes that I had for this time around
next for little face products and a half
I have to neutrogena products wow wow
surprise there I have the fresh foaming
cleanser by neutrogena which I
by the second bottle of this and I'm
almost done that one as well in my
shower and then listen I got 18th bottle
of the oil-free eye makeup remover by
neutrogena I didn't repurchase this
surprisingly just because it was a
little greasy on my eyes and I was
noticing it made my eyelids get kind of
dried out surprisingly um but I want to
be simple I'm i can remember brain so
that's exciting it works pretty well
pretty well then I have wow surprised
too great lash lots of lashes mascaras
which are my favorite mascara except I
feel like you sometimes need to take a
break from these because they do the job
amazingly when you haven't used them in
a while but then like when you just keep
using bottle after bottle after bottle
it's just like my fourth or fifth bottle
in a row of these because they're so
cheap and it works amazingly it just
starts to lose its like wow factor and I
think beanie baby 44 also said that in
her video it starts to lose its amazing
factor and the reason why we love it is
because it does an amazing job when you
repetitively use the same one it just
loses you know it's as well so I'm on to
the million flash one memorial and I
love it I tried to get that one before
but I got like this balloon is / one but
i got the million lashes one this time
and i'm loving it so far next I have my
favorite face product of all time I have
it on right now on this is Oh farts you
oh nasty oh I got foundation all over me
Oh anyway it's my BB cream by Garnier
and I see s we have 20 skin renew
miracle skin Perfector combination oily
skin light to medium BAM this is the
greatest thing ever it makes me look tan
ish but up whoa hello but not like
orange and disgusting and I just love it
it goes not so smooth it's just not
crease and it's literally the greatest
thing I've ever found for my skin these
are like my third bottle i think i'm
going out to buy a new one tonight I
just I love these products so much they
like 12 bucks from the drugstore oh my
god I just this baby her name is the
greatest thing it I compared to like
fifty dollar foundations these triumphs
over him next we have one of my favorite
primers I've ever tried which is the all
nice smart shade I use this in my
homecoming video and it's definitely
definitely definitely a great great
great primer um my mom has this one so
then I bought it um but it's totally out
but there's a little left but there
isn't um it shaped like DNA it's purple
and green is about 10 bucks for a little
tiny tube but that's okay because it's
amazing
also have another primer which is
Porefessional and if you saw this in my
last video I did not like it very much
because just didn't do much for me so I
started to give it in there another
chance still don't really do anything
and you know it smells fine the texture
is fine it just doesn't like prevent
creasing for my skin and my skin is
really really jank it's just my skin's
direct up sometimes so like I love
benefits my favorite high end makeup
brand you know but professional just
this isn't this primer doesn't work I
should check out there other primers
they have like three other ones but
Porefessional said they tried it again
still do not do job everyone claims does
sorry benefit I love you but not that
product it just it didn't work for me
and I have a little trial of the naked
skin my Urban Decay I used the lightest
shade because she's like it Nick it's
gonna be dark for your skin and I was
like what I want to try it and that was
at Sephora so then she was like fine so
then she kicked the worker ladies so she
gave me the lightest shade I didn't
really like it at all because it just
was really really didn't blend in it was
heavy and it didn't blend in onto my
skin cuz again my skin's genk and hardly
anything works with it and that
definitely did not then i have my
maybelline fit me concealer i literally
just bought this to three weeks ago and
it's gone so oh it's all spilt with the
hell so I don't know why this went
through so quickly it's kind of
disappointing that it's ready gone I
liked that was really really nice was a
great shade it's like Shane um obviously
for me cuz I'm fail but um it's like
gone right then I have one of my
favorite rich eyeliners which is the
essence not unless did I pencil and I go
through these so quickly but they're so
cheap they're two bucks and they last
awhile long-lasting eye pencil last oil
what I was radical anyway those were
great and yeah and then i have to
mascara i have my maybelline rocket
volume Express and then my voluminous
false fiber lashes by L'Oreal I went
through another one of these they were
great I still can find a million lashes
one thrown with her another one of these
it's my second one and they work really
good especially on bottom lashes and
this one was amazing which I love
Maybelline mascara but sometimes i have
like trouble with them anyway this one
was really really great a lot of people
hated this a lot of people loved it
olympus one that loved it so I went
through these two and they were actually
pretty good and I usually have trouble
with my mascaras because nothing ever
does the job for my lashes either I'm so
picky with mega product I literally have
foundation on my hair and I didn't
realize that continuing on with the next
makeup products I have to lip color
color reach lip balms I always mess up
the name of these but I'm really picky
again to make a product for my lips this
times the lipsticks they don't work for
me but I love these lore'l lip balms and
so I have this one and 318 heavenly
Barry I got this on the day of
homecoming and it's already gone and
then 418 Karen coral which I've had for
longer than this one but these are great
I definitely need to get more cuz i love
lip products but I can never find any
that work for me these definitely did
though and the last product that i have
used is my favorite one of my favorite
body sprays of all time which is um
victoria secret bombshell body mist it
came in a perfume said that i got from
my friend kaitlyn for my birthday two
years ago I think it was her yeah two
years ago he's like stuff more your
thing and took me a while to get through
this which I'm glad about because I
loved it but see if I can still smell it
oh it smells so good Oh a little
surprise it's the greatest thing ever I
went in oh why don't we do this I can do
I always do this ice literally just
spray it and then like go right into it
I went in to get another one of these
like a little one or a big one or
whatever I could find and I'm pretty
sure they still sell it but I couldn't
find it when I went in there the one
time and I never tried to find it again
I really need to go back though cuz I'm
out of my I most out of my gap um bodies
right to so I just need to get new
perfume cuz I using so much all the time
24 7 and I'm out of my two favorite ones
so that was my empties video number two
