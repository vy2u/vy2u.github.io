about the first time that I went to like
a bar at college but basically and what
college bars are liking like what to
expect it's kind of good Girl Talk video
so you know when you go if you go okay
the first time one do actual bar was my
second semester at miss day because
first semester I just went to like frat
parties they sucked
you're really dark smelly sweaty gross
guys that are all upon you not fun
unless that's your scene yeah so first
one went to a bar bar was February of my
second semester at the zoo and I Lucifer
my friend's birthday party was turning
21 I thought I was 18 I've never been to
a bar didn't know this whole like bars
scene how to get into a bar what you
have to do fake IDs I don't have once
this day I know everyone else that does
but I don't have one I don't go to bars
that require IDs if you're under 21 I
just get X's on my hands and then go in
and I don't drink but I just kind of
stand there and I'm like and so I went
there very um I guess stupid basically
so where to describe it about how to get
into a bar because this specific bar was
got to be over 21 even though it was a
birthday party okay so I go in with slow
present with my um friend and I'm we're
trying to get in and and she has a fake
but I don't
and so she gives it to it whatever it
gets in and I'm like what I had to do
show my license and they're like just
come on in and I'm like I have to pass
this bouncer first so like but I don't
have a fake and I wasn't gonna use one I
wasn't gonna go home because I had just
taken a taxi downtown to get to this
stupid bar so I am very like I said
stupid about this wipe something here
you go and I handed my real ID and
apparently like if you enjoyed real ID
they can be like oh my god you're not
over 21 so goodbye but you know this
bitch got it okay so I'm like like I'm
not even had anything to drink I was
like I'm here for a birthday party and
I'm gonna drink water and they were like
I donno they were looking at cuz I'm
like that says 1986 you can tell that
I'm 18 because it was just 15 and then
they're like okay I guess you can go
you're not gonna drink and I'm like no
but I it's like I think everyone knows
that I don't drink but no one knows that
except like me you know so I'm like no I
don't drink and they're like okay I'm
like I promise I will not drink and
they're like fine like my name and so
yeah that was my first time getting into
a bar I'll be say that for like two
seconds everyone else drink except me
because I'm a good girl but college bar
is in general I don't want to be a
debbie downer but they're not super fun
it's kind of like you know your high
school's homecoming where they please
shitty music - the cha cha slide cuz we
don't do that at bars but it's like
basically like that like oh they're
playing some closer I've never heard
this before it was things a chain-smoker
he's like you know it's like very
overplayed pop music crowded areas dark
sweaty and there's always that one fat
ass mean balance room that always thinks
you're trying to drink even if you're
not me you know cuz I'll just be saying
that I can and they're legit all I'm
like and I always like drink water right
I drink what all the time so I don't
worry about like me and he literally
rips the water bottle on my hand and is
like you can't head this in you okay I'm
like it's do you literally think I have
a bottle full of just like straight
vodka like huh like look things up
so hardcore Drecker I'm like you been
selling a few one but can I keep my
water like I just paid 250 for that and
then he took it and threw it away I'm
like okay so then I'm like this is just
like sporadic events over the entire
semester of like this past year that
same bouncer like I went outside I got a
million mosquito bites when I came back
in and I got a cup of ice at the bar to
put on my was heated bites cuz you know
I can't really stop some my really itchy
mosquito bites because I'm allergic to
mosquitoes is straight ice just on the
skin and so I was like had a cup of ice
like a tiny little like cup that you
find like a bathroom or something for
mouthwash I was like taking about
putting ice cubes all over my legs right
and then he comes up to me again this
bouncer guy and he's like okay you know
what any rips that little ice at my hand
he's like you can't have this like we
know that you can't have this this is
what they call elbow and you cannot
drink through X's on your hands
21 I'm like no no no no no there's no
liquid in it you can clearly see I'm
using this from a mosquito bite it seems
like okay like good one it takes it
throw it away I'm like weights I'm
eating and now I don't have my freaking
ice balancers to piss me off I think
it's because I'm not trying to sneak
alcohol
I don't drink and I'm not gonna drink so
the fact you keep targeting me why don't
you try to clock all these other people
that have fake IDs that got in their
drinking no no because you're stupid so
you're gonna keep coming for me okay
okay one of the same page buddy I'm not
trying to sneak anything past you so
stop trying to me over bars a
college are just very like and like when
I see in movies like bars looks so much
more like not romantic but just like
sultry and fun and like classy lighter
than that right like it just looks so
yes like you go to the bar order a
martini Oh some mysterious culture
handsome guy walks up to you like that's
where they portray movies I know movies
aren't real but you know that's what I
expected a little bit more to be liked
and maybe it will be like in the real
world but college bars are college bars
for a reason adult and older people out
of college don't go there they're not
present there so it's all these like
teenage guys who want one thing these
teenage girls getting blackout drunk and
me and I'm just like and guys will come
you know guys will come up to me and my
friends and stuff and like get numbers
and it's fine and all whatever and you
meet a nice guy or two if you see your
friends take some pictures but remember
pictures always look a lot more fun than
it actually is that goes for everything
everyone in every moment in life you
think someone is perfect life until you
realize it's not bad fun pictures can be
cute but it's not bad fun and so yeah I
saw the drink I'm not gonna drink
because if you never start you'll never
have a problem but that's what the hype
is it's like you go out you see in this
long line you pay five ten fifteen
dollars cover charge just to get in and
then you actually your ID whether you
try to use a fake or not I don't so I
always get the X something as marking
that I'm under 21 you go in with your
friends it's hot as hell the music is
crappy and blaring people are like
crying and making out in this dance
floor where there's beer spills all over
the floor some awkward guy from your
class that you just saw earlier that day
is gonna walk up to you and be like who
you and you have to see him tomorrow and
you're gonna remember that awkward drunk
encounter it's especially awkward when
you hug or kiss or dance with someone
from a class and
to see them again you're like and you
both I can guarantee you both always
pretend like it never happened in the
back of mind you both know that it
happened so yeah that's what the barks
pants is like um college bars are
college bars that means college kids go
to them and it wastes it because it's a
first time away from home or just meet
them being away from home allows them
the freedom to do whatever they want
especially if they get past but afaik is
usually people who are over 21 don't go
to these type of sleazy bars and yeah
yeah that's it
so I hoping through this video and if
you want to know more college tips or

experienced a lot so just leave it down
