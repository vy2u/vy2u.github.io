requested video which is like my face
routine or how I get rid of acne how I
keep acne away how I keep my skin clear
blah blah blah go with my everyday and
tonight they swash routine thing um
people want to see this because they're
commenting on my skin and first of all
thank you so much you don't know how
much that means to me last year
sophomore year I had a lot of trouble
with my skin especially my forehead that
was the only place I ever got sits but
it was just tons and tons and tons um
I'll put a picture now
you
I know that people have worse acne than
that and I know I shouldn't be
complaining even about that but for me
that was bad and I don't want anything
acting in my skin so I really tried to
fix it and get new products to clean it
up with and stuff like that and it
definitely did help I believe so first
of all I'll just do my morning routine
because it has absolutely like nothing
like there's only one product I use in
the morning and it's my Cetaphil daily
facial cleanser this is just really
basic it's just the original Cetaphil
cleanser I used to used to be Oriya but
I ran out which is super sexy dont sell
it anymore at Target but I should give
this one instead because I always want
to try Cetaphil I heard great things it
doesn't have a fragrance it's really
like digs deep down it's all the dirt
you know out and this for any skin type
and I'm just I was really wanted to try
this Biore did wonders with cleaning up
my skin and this just wonders with
keeping it that way so again this is
just set aful I use it in the morning
and the night but when I wake up this is
all I use i just use set a flow to wash
my face and then i go ahead and get on
with my makeup so i'm not some huge
cleanser exfoliator in the morning i do
more stuff during the night but
basically i just have my little set a
full face wash and it wakes me right up
and i love this stuff so that's my
morning routine basically i find that
the more products you use sometimes
makes you break out more you think it's
helping clearing it up but it's actually
bring more oils and more things that
could cause a reaction and breakouts and
rashes and stuff like that in your face
so if i am having a bad break out which
i do not use these products everyday not
even every week really I'm just whenever
I have a bad breakdown and I want to
like zap those zits or whatever I used
to love cosmetics things and it depends
on which one I feel like they both do
the same thing they're both fresh face
masks so the first one is Oda fix and
it's just a blend of bananas vanilla
like almonds and oats and it nourishes
and cool irritated skin and I do have
irritated skin often it's really it gets
really red and stuff so this is just
nice to put on before I do my facial
washes and stuff because I this has like
a lot of like grimy oats and stuff in it
and I'll show you it looks like that and
so I don't want this to be the last part
of my routine because I feel like I'd
always have some of that greeny Banana
Nut stuff left on my face so if I was
when to use one of the face masks then
um I would use it as the first step in
my night routine I also have the baby
seaweed
this one is a
our rich mass to cleanse and soften so
of my skins feeling a little dry rough
during the winter time this is the one
I'll use it's kind of nasty looking but
it does good job at exploiting and
getting rid of dead skin and dry skin
and the cheese scratchy disgusting this
so yes I only use these and my skin
isn't in deep need of repair if it's
breaking out if it's dry it's gross and
red I'll use one of these otherwise I
don't like to use these that often
because I'm very frightened that maybe
if I use these every day or every week
they cause me to break out more than I
was doing before I started using these
everyday what I don't know if that's
just made sense but in other words Zoe
sees everyday in caution of breakouts so
we stop things during videos medicine
aah ow
so the next part of my routine is using
a makeup remover cleansing pellets now
this is definitely not all I need to do
or you guys need you if you use these
yes this is a great way to get the easy
first layer of makeup and eye makeup off
but that's definitely not where you need
to stop because there's so much grime
and dirt and makeup and discussing this
left on your skin that you do not want
to go to bed with it all on there
because this does the job for like the
first layer but you don't know all the
stuff that's soaked into your skin and
your skin absorb I used to use only this
and I was getting breakouts and like
this is not all you need to use because
there's so much more left on your skin
that you didn't know about but
definitely use this for the first layer
because it does great on taking that
first layer of heavy makeup and primer
and powders and blush Brunt's they're
mad if I'm powder all that crap off
that's what these are good for then my
eye makeup especially mascara is usually
not all off just using this wipe so I
use your genius oil-free I makeup
remover right now he needs to be
oil-free just to prevent any um
disgusting oil for making me bring out
around my eyes or something just remind
alike that so this is just um I just use
this with cotton ball or cotton swab
really good it gets it right off
waterproof anything it gets it off and
um I've had this for a long time and
lays that much so it's really nice just
to get all the mascara off because you
do want to replenish your lashes you
don't want to sleep with tons of mascara
left on them so this is nice just it's
like a toner for your eye lashes and you
know any eyeshadow grime that's left on
your eyes then I usually take my settle
daily facial cleanser again and do a
nice heavy duty face wash just getting
everything and this doesn't necessarily
take any makeup off or extra
I missed with from the wipes but it just
cleanses the natural nutrients in the
oils that you want in your skin the good
kind of oils and it helps with pores and
stuff like that so no it's not gonna get
a lot of makeup off but it does help
with just getting dirt and cleansing and
making your skin feel nice and fresh and
new and clean for the night so that's
always good and usually by the time that
I'm done with all that my skin will
start to get red because like I said
before I do have kind of red irritated
skin a lot but these last two steps are
definitely still needed now I just start
using this last month and I don't know
what I was doing with my life before I
found this and it's Neutrogena is
alcohol-free toner and this stuff is
amazing my cousin showed it to me
actually and she was like you do put a
lot of face makeup on there's so much
left than just you know from a facial
cleanser facial wipe after you use those
there's so much left so I was like how
much could possibly be left or I thought
like many others that the white cut it
all off and I was wrong because I used
cotton ball or cotton swab or pad after
I use all those products and just go
over my face on my cheeks forehead and
nose and pores in that kind of area I'm
just basically my whole face but I don't
use it around my eyes but this is just
oh my god oh my god oh my god the first
time balls usually um more of a brownish
makeup a tint because so getting makeup
that was left on there and then the last
two are like it looks like a dirt like
it's like kind of grayish like I know
this is really gross but it's not just
nice together so where it's everyone's
skin it's left on their from the day and
you do not realize how much dirt and
grime left on your skin it's so
important that you use a toner
um this is alcohol-free has absolutely
no oil or and it doesn't make me break
out it's just great then to finish off
my set actually kind of seemed like a
longer routine but I promise it's really
not it's like five minutes
it's my cleaning clear dual action
moisturizer I do not put this all over
my face because I do find that this
causes breakouts because this says
oil-free but something in it I don't
know if it's has to have oils in or
something the lotion feel to it the
texture something makes me get a few
more zits than I would like but right
it's more of a spa treatment
this is just a solace salicylic
I think it's I say an acid acne
medication and I and I use it
specifically for that purpose only on my
sets I do not put it anywhere else
because it's really greasy and I don't
like that after I just oh that
I don't want to put this on my face so
it's yes and just like dab a little on
and rub it in it comes out white and it
goes on clear so that's my face routine
I hope you enjoyed this video if you're
wondering what I do to keep my skin
clear it's doing really well so far

working for me better than that picture
