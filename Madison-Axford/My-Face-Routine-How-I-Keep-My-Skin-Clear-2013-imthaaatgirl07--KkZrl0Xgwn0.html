requested video which is like my face
routine or how i get rid of acne how I
keep acne away how to keep my skin clear
blah blah blah blah I'll go with my
every day and tonight they swash routine
thing um people want to see this because
the vomiting on my skin and first of all
thank you so much you don't know how
much that means to me last year
sophomore year I had a lot of trouble
with my skin especially my forehead
there's the only place I ever got sits
but it was just tons and tons and tons
um I'll put a picture now
you
I know that people have were sacked me
than that and I know I shouldn't be
complaining even about that but for me
that was bad and I don't want any acting
in my skin so I really tried to fix it
and get new products to clean it up with
and stuff like that and it definitely
did help I believe so first of all I'll
just do my morning routine because it
has absolutely like nothing like there's
only one product days in the morning and
it's my cetaphil daily facial cleanser
this is just really basic it's just the
original cetaphil cleanser um I used to
used to be already but I ran out which
is super sex they dont sell it anymore
target but i should give this one
instead because i always want to try
cetaphil i heard great things it doesn't
have a fragrance it's really like digs
deep down it's all the dirt you know out
and this for any skin type and i'm just
i was really want to try this be already
did wonders with cleaning up my skin and
this just wonders with keeping it that
way so again this is just settle i use
it in the morning and the night but when
i wake up this is all i use i just use
cetaphil to wash my face and then i go
ahead and get on with my makeup so i'm
not some huge cleanser exfoliator in the
morning i do more stuff during the night
but basically I just have my little
settable face wash and it wakes me right
up and I love this stuff so that's my
morning routine basically i find that
the more products you use sometimes
makes you break out more you think it's
helping clearing it up but it's actually
bring more oils and more things that
could cause a reaction and breakouts and
rashes and stuff like that in your face
so if i am having a bad break out which
i do not use these products every day um
not even every week really I'm just
whenever I have a bad break down and I
want to like zap those zits or whatever
I used to lush cosmetics things and it
depends on which one I feel like they
both do the same thing they're both
fresh face masks so the first one is Oh
to fix and it's just a blend of bananas
vanilla almonds and oats and it
nourishes and cools irritated skin and I
do have irritated skin often it's really
uh it gets really red and stepped so
this is just nice to put on before i do
my facial washes and stuff because I
this is like a lot of like grimy oats
and stuff in it and i'll show you it
looks like that and so I don't want this
to be the last part of my routine
because I feel like I'd always have some
of that grainy banana nut stuff left on
my face so if I was going to use one of
the face masks then um i would use it as
the first step in my night routine i
also have the BB seaweed this one is a
mineral rich mass
to cleanse and soften so of my skin's
feeling a little drier rough during the
wintertime this is the one I'll use its
kind of nasty looking but it does good
job at exploiting and getting rid of
dead skin and dry skin and the cheese
scratchy disgustingness so yes it only
use these in my skin isn't in deep need
of repair if it's breaking out if it's
dr gross and red i'll use one of these
otherwise i don't like to use these that
often because I'm very frightened that
maybe if I use these every day or every
week they cause me to break out more
than I was doing before it started using
these everyday what I don't know that
she's made sense but in other words i
don't use everyday and caution of break
out so please dropped in showing videos
medicine ah ah so the next part of my
routine is using a makeup remover
cleansing towelettes now this is
definitely not all i need to do or you
guys need you if you use these yes this
is a great way to get the easy first
layer of makeup and eye makeup off but
that's definitely not where you need to
stop because there's so much grime and
dirt and makeup and discussing this left
on your skin that you do not want to go
to bed with it all on there because this
does the job for like the first layer
but you don't know all the stuff that's
soaked into your skin and your skin
absorb i used to use only bit and I was
getting breakout and like this is not
all you need to use because there's so
much more left on your skin that you
didn't know about but definitely use
this for the first layer because it does
great on taking that first layer of
heavy makeup and primer and powders and
blush fronts or mattifying powder all
that crap off that's what these are good
for then on my eye makeup especially
mascara is you should not all off just
using the swype so I use your genius
oil-free eye makeup remover now it needs
to be oil free just to prevent any um
disgusting oil for making me break out
her on my eyes or something just running
like that so this is just um I just use
this with cotton ball or cotton swab
really good it gets it right off
waterproof anything it gets it off and
I've had this for a long time and weighs
that much so it's really nice just to
get all the mess Kara off because you do
want to replenish your eyelashes you
don't want to sleep with tons of mascara
left on them so this is nice just it's
like a toner for your eyelashes and you
know any eyeshadow grime that's left on
your eyes then I usually take my
cetaphil daily facial cleanser again and
do a nice heavy duty face wash just
getting everything this doesn't
necessarily take any makeup off or extra
that I missed with
from the wipes but it just cleanses the
natural nutrients in the oils that you
want in your skin the good kind of oils
and it helps with pores and stuff like
that so no it's not going to get a lot
of makeup off but it does help with just
getting dirt in cleansing making your
skin feel nice and fresh and new and
clean for the night so that's always
good and usually by the time that I'm
done with all that my skin will start to
get red because like i said before i do
have kind of red irritated skin a lot
but the last two steps are definitely
still needed now i just start using this
last month and i don't know what i was
doing with my life found this and it's
neutrogena is alcohol-free toner had
this stuff is amazing my cousin showed
it to me actually and she was like you
do put a lot of face makeup on there's
so much left than just you know from a
facial cleanser facial wipe after you
use those there's so much left so I was
like how much could possibly be left I
thought like many others that the white
cut it all often I was wrong because I
use cotton ball or cotton swab or pad
after i use all those products and just
go over my face on my cheeks forehead
and nose &amp;amp; poor's in that kind of area
I'm she's basically my whole face by
don't use around my eyes but this is
just oh my god oh my god oh my god first
gumballs usually um more of a brownish
makeup beat int because so getting
makeup that was left on there and then
the last two are like it looks like a
dirt like it's like kind of grayish
black I know this is really gross but
it's not just my eyes together so
where's everyone's skin it's left on
there from the day and you do not
realize how much dirt and brians left on
your skin is so important that you use a
toner um this is alcohol-free has
absolutely no oil or it doesn't make me
break out it's just great then to finish
off my set actually kind of seemed like
a long routine but it promises really
not it's like five minutes is my
cleaning clear dual action moisturizer I
do not put this all over my face because
I do find that this causes breakouts
because it says oil-free but something
in it I don't know if it's has have oils
in or something the lotion feel to it
the texture something makes me get a few
more zits than I would like but it's
more of a spot treatment this is just um
a sillas salicylic I think if I say an
acid acne medication and I and I use it
specifically for that purpose only on my
sets I do not put it anywhere else
because it's really greasy and I don't
like that after i just don't like
cleaning i don't
this on my face so it's yes and just
like dab a little on rub it in it comes
out white and it goes on clear so if
that's my face routine i hope you
enjoyed this video if you're wondering
what i do to keep my skin clear it's
doing really well so far um after i
started the treatment I've been doing
this for a while and it's been working
for me better than that picture I showed

hope that I made me shows you some new
products give you some your tips
