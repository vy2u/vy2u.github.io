products I like them so much better than
high-end I use five face products by
them so that should tell you something
chuckling chuckling chuckling chuckling
not really because my blank in like my I
juice I juice what medicine I juice
gotta get those lashes puffing I
literally use everything for my skin
from Neutrogena because it's such such
an amazing brand heyo so today I'm doing
a video which is my favorite products
from the drug store I was actually
requested to do this from my facebook
page so if you haven't like me on
Facebook already what are you doing with
your life you need to go like me it's
just and that girl 7 it's a fan page
whoop-dee-doo um I look on their luck to
like connect with you guys and talk to
you guys and give a request I'm not just
saying you like it so no I have likes
I'm saying go like it so we keep up to
date with each other and I know what you
want to see and you can you know no one
I'm gonna post a video and stuff like
and that so without further ado let's
get into my top favorite drugstore
products so you've probably seen all of
these like a hundred billion thousand
times in my favourites videos but
drugstore products are my favorite
products I like them so much better than
high end because they're so affordable
and if you find the right ones they are
amazing so I have a few initial category
you know eyes face lips whatever but
let's go with video so no these are
probably gonna be surprises but for my
face is my guardian BB cream in light to
medium with SPF 20 i love this BB cream
more than anything um more than any face
prog I've ever tried not just the
immigrants foundations powders anything
you don't need a primary John to
concealer just this in this covers of
all your blemishes it does have a little
bit of an orange eat it though so if you
don't like the extra really tan glow
stay away from this but I love it and
it's really liquidy for people who have
dry skin or maybe not even dry skin but
just you know it makes you look really
dewy it doesn't make you look greasy or
oily but Dewey in a good way and i just
cannot rev up the stretch enough it is
my favorite thing to put on my face it
feels really light even though it covers
amazingly and yes this is by far my
greatest found ever product and it
happens to be from drugstore so it's one
of my favorite drugstore products ever
next are my Rimmel powders I'm allergic
to rimmel foundations I
because I always work out get rashes
when I use them but I tried the powders
and thank goodness I didn't break out or
get a rash or anything or have an
allergic reaction from these because
these are the greatest face powders um
especially the bronzer this runs are in
020 sunshine is my favorite bronzer it
beat bronze booster in my book I love it
so so much and it bronze pastries to be
my favorite it was hard to beat but I
found this one for like a third of the
price it's amazing well it's amazing
I've hit pan I've had this like oh my
god it's amazing and I've hit pan I've
only had this for like two weeks so I
just I love it so much for a broader I
put it everywhere on my face ever taught
my BB cream and then i have the Rimmel
stay matte powder + 011 creamy natural
and this I don't really use over the BB
cream because this is like way lighter
than this cuz I used it for like my
really pale foundation for my real pale
skin but i really really love this it
keeps you super modified and it does add
a little more color um to your face so
if you want a little you know more of a
tannish look applies over top of pale
foundation and everything works out in
the end because it just adds a little
more color it's not translucent or sheer
it does have a little color and I'm also
hit pan on this but I've had this for a
while and I haven't been using it as
much lately r at all when I went back to
this BB cream which I don't know why I
ever left this anyway we're done talking
about that product but rebel fighters
are amazing definitely check them out um
these are like I think these like the
two lightest powders or no not this one
this is the lightest bronzer and this is
like the second or third two lightest
powder because i am palin i want to keep
that into consideration to make sure you
are you know when i tell you the numbers
on things keep your skin tone into
consideration cuz just because I'm light
or dark you know whatever might not mean
that you're like that so well juggling
juggling juggling juggling not really so
just keep that in consideration and
definitely check out rimmel powders
because I love their patters they're the
most amazing powders and they're from
the drugstore yet again what this whole
video is from the drugstore but people
always think and ask me they're like you
really find amazing products from the
drugstore like is the drugstore its
targets walgreens but I feel like I've
got so many more favorite drugstore
products and I have actual high-end
products so there's that next four eyes
I have an essence long lasting I'll
pencil which is not a gel it's not and a
pencil pencil it's not liquid it's like
weird I don't know what it is it's just
super waxy and it's a roll up if that
helps cut clarify what this is because I
don't I honestly don't know what this is
made out of or what it is like a crayon
hits soft and this literally is great
I'm like shaking uh I've had gone
through like nine of these and they're
two dollars i think it is so the
cheapest product i have the drugstore
from anywhere and it's just incredible
I've gotten so many people hooked on
these because they are just really
really great and I love them and I love
the fact that it stays on my waterline
it doesn't just you know wash right off
because when I blink in like my I juice
I juice what medicine I juice like
washes it away that happened with pencil
at this one from essence is amazing and
then if you want to go a little crazy
dramatic cat eye with yo liquid liner go
look at line stiletto by Maybelline
because I was very uneasy about trying
this because so many people liked it so
many people didn't that's the way it
always does products but I decided to
finally get it like a few weeks ago and
the thing that I love about this is it's
like wand or it's like marker thing is
so long but it's also like sturdy so
it's not flimsy just all over the place
to make a mess it creates a very very
great sin online cuz it's like super
skinny and you can just do it really
easily and it doesn't make it super
thick or you know gothic looking and it
doesn't you know it doesn't like make a
mess cuz I've had so many that are so
bad and they just go everywhere and this
also drive super duper quickly so once
you put it on it's like you're good to
go like you you can go ahead and look up
blink a hundred times put mascara and it
will not get all over your lid or your
under-eyes circle whatever thing because
i have had liquid liner that do that all
the time like I've him put it on she
gets all over and it's a mess then for
lip products I have my EOS balls which
is an obvious I love you so much and
like every flavor I've tried every
flavor um I steal my sisters because
they're great and I want them all and
this one I don't know what flavor it is
but it doesn't matter I like all the
flavors and they're just like little
bowls of chapstick and it's super super
cute they don't have any color she them
but they moisturize I'm
amazingly and they're just fun like role
in your lips you like what's a little
bow and no it's fun it's fun and to add
a little extra moisture in color to my
lips I got my L'Oreal coloration lip
balms that this isn't surprising I I
don't know I don't think I've named this
in every video I've ever done pretty
much this one's in pink satin 118 but I
tried like a lot a lot of the colors and
this is just like a baby pink one they
put off such amazing color but they
don't make your lips do like a weird
crease thing they don't make they don't
like I don't know how to say it but
they're like sheer but they had tons of
color so if you get outside your lips a
little or you get it on your teeth by
accident I won't show like lipstick and
all that's good you know for girls we're
thinking about the factors of lipstick
whether or not we should wear it I
always opt out of wearing lipsticks I'm
so scared I'll get all over my face or
it'll crease and look disgusting like I
have a fungus on my lips this does not
see that but it provides amazing color
which is always great I do want to wear
color on my lips it's just I don't like
lipstick at all yeah my last two
products happened to be a mascara it's
cuz mascara is the greatest thing I
gotta get those lashes puffing my first
one is the infamous Great Lash lots of
lashes it has been up forever um but you
know the Great Lash lots of lashes lots
of lashes one just recently became
popular if you like them lost 23 years
so um it's the comb brush was just
amazing but I do have to take a break
from this one every now and then I can't
just keep repurchasing bottle after
bottle of this even though it's so great
because it's like it like stops being
amazing after a while which is fine all
things do that so then I have to go to
my voluminous million lashes which took
me 10 and a half billion years to find
but I finally founded by L'Oreal and I
love this one the brush is nothing
special but it does provide amazing
results and I literally have to do like
two swipes and I'm done I'm ready I'm
ready to go out the door I'd cuz like
with this one it's amazing but I feel
you have to do so many so many so many
coats I get a great result but I have to
sit there for a while however I don't
with this one and its really great and
I'm so thankful I found these two I'm
think I found all of these because my
skin so weird it's so sensitive so jank
and find amazing products to work for my
jiang clips my take under eye circles
much ink skin that's all red it's just
amazing
very very thankful that I did fine these
in the last product i want to mention
before in this video i almost forgot it
is makeup remover wipes and i love
neutrogena for all all things skin care
i don't mean high-end skincare products
to feel happy and confident with my skin
I need neutrogena they're amazing i use
their cleansing towelettes and that's
all I'm going to show but i also used to
make a group I makeup remover their
toner which I also love to death and
they're on foaming face cleanser for my
face wash and their poor exfoliator I
freaking love all of nutritionist
products they're amazing they're very
affordable for the results they produce
it surely might be more expensive than
like I don't know maybe I'm saying like
that but I wouldn't look to them for
skin care products you know but they're
both the same as like a lei or something
like that and they are just the greatest
things i'm so happy i found this i
literally use everything for my skin
from Neutrogena because it's such such
an amazing brand and it works well with
my skin it might not for you but you
should definitely look into try at least
and makeup remover pads or like the face
wash or something or the toner oh yes
the toner is amazing and i just love
everything neutrogena i use five face
products by them so that should tell me
something so anyway i hope you enjoyed
