anyone's really done this but it's my
favorite emojis it's the ones that I use
the most and the ones that are just
freakin amazing
so I'm gonna do that today and without
further ado let's get into this video so
my first favorite emoji and probably my
most used one is the smiley face with
the hearts of the eyes like it has two
hearts for its eyes I use that one so
much it's so cute whenever I like
something or I like talking to someone
you're gonna get that smiley face and I
just love it so so much it's so cute and
I use it all the time
my second favorite emoji is the smurfy
sly face one is the one that's loving I
like no gonna lie it's really
mischievous and it makes me laugh the
third one is a literally such a boss ass
bitch so red scary mask dude I just like
what is that what he's perfect and I
don't really use him that much but if
we're in a conversation that's really
random or crazy he'll be used he's funny
then we have poop okay but the poop one
is so cute like honestly it is so cute
it has like little eyes and it's like
how can you not love this little poop
picture this little poop emoji it's just
Perth I really like that one I don't use
it that much but it's cute I had it had
to be included then I like the three
monkeys which is like this see no evil
hear no evil speak no evil I think and I
just like them because I like that
little quote same thing and I think
they're cute going do little actions and
they're cute they're cute then also one
of my most use emojis ever is the one
that's likes the fingers like this like
