anyone's really done this but it's my
favorite emojis it's the ones that I use
the most and the ones that are just
freaking amazing so I'm gonna do that
today and without further ado let's get
into this video so my first favorite
emoji I'm probably my most used one is
the smiley face with the hearts of the
eyes like it has two hearts for his eyes
I use that one so much it's so cute
whenever I like something or I like
talking to someone you're gonna get that
smiley face and I just love it so so
much it's so cute and I use it all the
time my second favorite emoji is smirky
sly face once the one that's letting i
like no lies really mischievious and it
makes me laugh the third one is a
literally such a boss ass bitch the red
scary mask to die just like what is that
what he's perfect and I don't really use
him that much but if we're to
conversation that's really random or
crazy he'll be used and he's funny then
we have poop okay but the poop one is so
cute like honestly it is so cute it has
like little eyes and it's like how can
you not love this little poop picture
this little poop emoji it's just perf
that one I don't use it that much but
it's cute i had it had to be included
then I like the three monkeys which is
like this see no evil hear no evil speak
no evil I think and I just like them
because I like that little quote same
thing and I think they're cute going to
be little actions and they're cute

use emojis ever is the one that's like
the fingers like this like hey okay I

one of my favorites I'm just always
liked
