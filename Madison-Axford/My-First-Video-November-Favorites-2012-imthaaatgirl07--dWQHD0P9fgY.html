very first video like ever and I went to
start being a YouTube beauty guru even
though I know there are hundreds of them
out there I feel like I have some fresh
and new tips that I want to share with
you and I hope you enjoy my very first
video which is going to be a November
favorites disclaimer I know it is only
like the middle of November but since
all the holidays are coming up next week
and all the hustle and bustle that comes
along with them I thought I get a my
first video up on this channel so you
could watch it there we continue after
the holidays I have four beautiful
Earth's four random favorites and then
my favorite songs of Ed month and my
favorite app of the month laughing yeah
I'm doing this new thing where I ask you
guys a question each month each during
each of my favorite videos and then I
would like you to answer in the comments
and without further ado let's get
started and happy holidays first I'm
going to start out with my four beauty
products that I have for the month of
November now I found all the things
during the month of November and I've
used them during the first I guess 15
days because this is November 15th today
and so I just have absolutely loved them
so the first one is Maybelline's dream
fresh BB cream and I am in the shade
light sheer tint it is the lightest
shade because I am super super pale I
don't know I don't know if you can tell
from this video the light it's kind of
weird but um I am very very pale so
whenever I buy something for foundation
or skin I always have to do the light
color and this is kind of what it looks
like I don't know if you can see that it
comes I got this from Target um and it
was around seven or eight dollars and it
just works amazing I was so sick of
putting foundation on every morning so I
have heard numerous great things about
this product so I was like okay I'm
gonna try it I've heard it's light and
it helps acne breakout so I got it and I
found that my acne breakouts on my
forehead have cleared up a little bit
I'm not gonna say it's some wonderful
product that helps clear up all acne but
it actually has made some of my sets go
away and also this is so light and it
blends within like five seconds it's
like it blends in your skin it just
works great and I just really like this
as an alternative to foundation the next
product that I have washed numerous
review videos here on YouTube about this
product because
it is a more expensive product I got
from Sephora and I was like do I want to
splurge on it or should I not I didn't
know what to do so I just watched the
reviews and I was like okay I'm gonna do
it I don't necessarily buy myself stupid
sets of makeup all the time but this was
one that was a little expensive for a
lipstick this is the Amazonian Tarte
lipsticks and this is in the shade
playful so I went it a dark color like I
didn't want a light pink color I didn't
want some red or anything cuz I already
had coarse like that I wanted a nice
deep plum for fall and winter then we
thought we'd go fill out my clothes and
would accentuate my pale skin so this is
what it looks like it's a very pretty
color it goes on and the only thing that
I'm not too fond about but I knew it was
gonna happen
this is like a 12 hour lipstick it's
supposed to last super long and you're
like that thing about it is like when
you put it on it does dry out your lips
so we either put on a moisturizer before
or after it because it does make them
kind of dry and that's not always the
best feeling but other than that does
does stay on through um like drinking
and eating the next beauty product is
elfs clarifying pressed powder I'm not a
big elf and I tried so so many other
products but they're all between one to
five dollars so I like to try them all
because you know if you don't like it
then you only spend like five dollars
max but this one was a dollar and I'm in
the shade ivory and this is what it
looks like I've almost hit pan now after
I put on my foundation or BB cream I do
have some shiny like parts of my
forehead and the apples of my cheeks so
I you don't want to put like bonzer on
so I use this mattifying powder which is
just it's like skin tone powder that you
put on any shiny parts and it makes them
non shiny and it also helps like set
your makeup and keep it on longer the
last beauty product I have is this Biore
combination skin facial cleanser and so
this is combination skin because they do
have oily skin like I said on my
forehead and apples my cheeks
but under my eyes and around my nose is
always like super dry that's kind of
gross but I don't know it is so I would
consider my skin somewhat combination so
I got this around November 1st or 2nd so
I've had it for two weeks and I have
noticed my skin clearing up which is
great so since I switched from heavy
foundation and Rory
to the or a facial cleanser and BB cream
I found some improvements my scale which
I'm very happy about okay so next in my
favorites video I just have four random
favorites they have nothing to do with
Beauty they're just random stuff that I
thought I'd share because I like them
so the first favorite I have is this
little scent bug it's like okay so it's
prom and Body Works and I got the white
one so it's super cute I got it off um
my works calm for ten dollars and you
just push this little button and this
thing pops out with a little like circle
pad and then you have to buy some of
this like juice I guess I don't know I
got black amethyst and so you just put
three or four drops on this little white
pad and then you pop it back in there
and then you push this button right here
on the side and if you can hear that and
a green little light pops on and so it's
just like if fans the smell out to your
room I guess slowly so it's not like
like so sudden and you're just like oh
overwhelmed it like gently makes your
room smoke and I really liked it and I
would recommend going to your local Bath
&amp;amp; Body Works and picking one up cuz it
is a great alternative to like just an
air freshener that doesn't always work
my next favorite is a candle back water
bottle now I have been getting a lot a
lot of colds recently as you can kind of
tell her go to Dick's Sporting Goods
they both have these and carry them I
think this was $15 because it is a
bigger one but I just got this blue one
and then it has a little like rubber
straw which you bite on it and then the
water comes up which I love it's really
fun to drink and it says on this little
sticker which I didn't rip it off cuz
like I liked it it says Jake might feel
better because I always feel dehydrated
and my throat's always dry and put some
water in it and as you can see I just
filled it up like an hour ago and I
already am down to the bottom next
favorite I have is this huge scarf which
I got from forever 21 when I was in New
York in Times Square I went in like
September and I picked this up and it's
just a herringbone Pareto's at the
bottom and like look how long is this
like it's just so long and so wide and
I'm if I feel like rapid dry may not get
like almost touches the floor because
I'm kind of short and this is just
absolutely wonderful it's so warm and my
last random favorite for November is
this necklace that I'm wearing I got it
at a local store so I'm not gonna say
the name and I know it may look a little
cheap but I think that it just kind of
pulls this outfit together just have
this cute sweater that I got from a
little Navy and then I thought this
necklace totally accentuated it
perfectly so as you can see it's just
like these plastic little wires then
they have these plastic balls on them
and then it goes down to this medallion
thing and I have some other like little
pasta bowls on here so it's totally your
opinion I know that you may be like that
looks so cheap and ugly but I like it so
next I'm going to show you my favorite
songs of the month in my favorite app

favorite app is of course it's going to

all-american and I just became a huge
fan of Woody Allen this is a great song

part and then hoodie comes on with this
rap and I just think it's a really cute
song and I love listening to it the next
