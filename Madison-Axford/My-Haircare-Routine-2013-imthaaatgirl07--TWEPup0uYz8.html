sophomore year a haircut heyo so today
I'm doing my hair care routine I've got
a lot of comments um asking me how I
keep my hair is still like I'm shiny and
straight and stuff like that I don't
really have a set routine i'm not a big
like product user I don't use mousse or
anything like that but I do straighten
my hair a lot which is probably why it's
open straight but also it does cause
damage and stuff like that to you know
the ends of your hair anyway I also do
color my hair but before I start even
talking about any of that blowfish my
intro um so I don't have a set routine
but these are all the products i use
shape your conditioner and stuff like
that so let's get started so like I was
saying I do color my hair and what I use
to color my hair um I do it at home and
it's clairol natural instincts this is
the exact color I have right now but
this is just an example of what the box
would look like at Target Walmart
Walgreens Ulta wherever you're going to
buy it so I like the national instincts
because it's not so harsh on your hair
it doesn't really um like bleach your
hair just kind of dyes it and then it
naturally rinses out after it supposed
to be seven washes it really lasts
longer than that on me which I love so I
have to keep buying this over two days
but I also um sometimes get the clean
version the other version is fine too as
long as it's just the natural instinct
and I do recommend you guys if you were
going to dye your hair or if you've been
thinking about it um do an allergy test
on your arm it says to do it right here
just to make sure that you're not
allergic to it I luckily wasn't but just
to be careful and be safe it says that
all over the box to do that and I just
recommend doing it also so you don't
have a witch reaction or any swelling
you know on your head um so yes this is
the stuff I use and I'm not saying go
dye your hair all obviously it's a lot
of money and it's a big commitment but
it has made my hair healthier and look
shinier and um when you first got your
hair does that I had virgin hair before
I dyed it and this is the third time
that I've guided I did it yesterday I'm
again but I love doing it it makes me
hurt to me shiny and smooth it might not
to you and I'm not saying diet that's
not the only way that you got to make it
smooth you know but it did work for me
and I'm really happy with my red color
so yeah that's the first thing I do to
my hair shampoo and conditioner i'm
using are the cheapest suave brand
for colored protection swallow has
really cheap was like two or three bucks
for these colored protection shampoo
conditioner I didn't want to spend an
excess amount of money on color
protection shampoo and conditioner so i
went with suave and it works amazingly i
just had the club protection um shampoo
i guess that's old school i thought i
had a name but it's just in this silver
bottle it's really two or three dollars
at target I just had to pick it up
because I do want to you know make the
color last as long as possible and I
really this is the second bottle that
I've had this I really love it and they
didn't have a conditioner in this kind
but suave also has the it's the same
thing as coal production but it's
keratin infused and I didn't think I'd
like this at first because I thought it
was kind of like I don't even know I
thought I was like Moroccan oil i was
like huh no I know one curtain but I
love it i'm super glad I picked it up
because if you on the shower with a
hundred billion knots in your hair you
put a little this conditioner on all
over from top to bottom you will be good
to go all your tangles are out
immediately it just works amazing so
again since i swelled it's just the gold
one rather than the silver and it's the
keratin infused um conditioner I love
this stuff seriously this was a dollar
more thanks seriously three dollars or
four dollars max now the last two things
that I'll ever use on my hair I
seriously don't use anything but I just
trained my hair quite often quite often
and if I'm going to straighten my hair
with my cheese straightening iron which
I love i'm going to use chismes thermal
um heat tamer spray protector thing
vitamin-enriched I don't know if it does
all that much because I straighten my
hair so often and sometimes I blow dry
my hair on school mornings and stuff um
but I do use this I love this because it
does protect it and I think it does cuz
my hair still smooth after many billions
of uses of heat on my hair um so I
really like this I suggest getting any
heat protector spray again I just picked
to trust my one because it's the
cheapest one that I found and there's
hair all over it and so yeah just use a
projector um sprite if you're going to
straighten your hair curl your hair
blow-dry your hair just you know even if
it didn't doesn't do much at least it
does protect it some it doesn't just fry
out your hair and make it all you know
hard and and gross and the last thing
that I'll ever use on my hair I
seriously don't like to use that much
stuff on my hair besides drinking and
stuff because it does cause damage
because I just don't want to put all
these things into my hair also I diet
you know and I don't pointed you know
put tons of products or mousse or deep
hair conditioners or I don't
no anything like curling my hair I just
don't want to do that since I do diet
and straighten it um but on day said I
don't want to use the heat on my hair
and don't know straighten it I'll just
let it air dry while always let it air
dry except if I'm running late on school
de I'll blow dry it whatever but if I
just want to let it air dry and make it
crimpy and in curly ish not really
perfect curls but I used not your
mother's beach babe texturizing salts
sea salts texturizing texturizing sea
salt spray to give myself a little extra
you know wave like I just got off the
beach in the ocean and I love this stuff
it was five dollars at my local grocery
store I really love this brand I want to
check out other products by them um but
the shop but they stopped carrying some
of them at my grocery stores so that was
kind of a bummer but I still have this
one that I'm tons left your God used it
a lot already and so I love to spring
this on my hair you kind of like crunch
your hair and um crimp it and then it
gives a lot of texture a lot of like
volume and it looks really great so I'll
do that on days that I don't my hair pin
straight but I want to actually little
volume and curl to it says my hair care
routine again I don't do much to it but
I hope I shown you the products that I
use maybe they'll help you or if you
were having you know problems like hair
something you'll see what I use I don't
know some people requested this and I
really thought it was cool and thank you
