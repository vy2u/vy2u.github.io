those anywhere it's lagging heyo so
today I'm doing my leggings collection
video cuz leggings are life I'm not a
huge fan of patterned leggings though
but I do have quite a few so I thought
I'd show them to you and legs are like
the it thing for winter like every year
like from 2010 till now leggings have
been the same to wear pants no no no one
wears those anymore it's lagging no I'm
just kidding I'm not saying that you
can't wear jeans but leggings have
become very very popular among teenage
girls so i thought i'd show you my
collection and yeah they're basically my
life and I wear them like everyday with
any shirt or shoes so let's get on with
the video so my first pair is just a
classic black leggings that I get mine
from forever 21 this is where I find the
cheapest ones they're literally like 384
one pair and I have 12 pairs of these I
love black leggings they do get holes in
them very quickly so they might only
last you for about like one season of
winter you know and then the next room I
have to get some new ones but they're
super cheap and I love them they go with
everything though they comfiest thing in
the world yeah I have 12 pairs of these
but check out forever 21 because they're
super cheap and like if you're like one
black leggings we don't want to get them
from Target or lululemon or wherever
that they're like really really
expensive especially lululemon they're
like 100 bucks go to forever 21 because
they're you know amazing and I just love
these to death then I have my capri
leggings I'm not a huge fan of these but
when you're working out or it's like
summer spring time and you still gonna
have that legging field these are the
ones that I'll go to you so the first
ones i have are from victoria secret
pink and they have these nice SEDs along
this flippy waist band thing and they're
just black capris um this waistband
thing you know you don't have to put it
down but it looks kind of stupid if you
keep it up and i like the jewels so you
know that's how that works and these are
really nice to use when you work out in
and then my next black capris are from
area and they also have a flip-down like
waste thing and i love this tribal print
got them for Christmas last year and
they're just super super cute and then I
have these ones from gap that I have not
worn yet but they are great and they're
just gray capris again and again I'm not
huge
capri leggings but they're amazing to
work out in when it's cool you know
in the winter you might not always want
to wear yoga pants but you can't wear
Sophie's or you know gym shorts so
legging capris are nice alternative
workout pants so yes these are from gap
and I got them for my birthday then I
have my leather leggings that I have two
pairs of leather leggings I'm just
showing you one though um because these
are from wet seal and they have zippers
on the bottom and then really cute my
other leather leggings don't have
zippers on the bottom but these are just
super duper cute and obviously the fake
leather but it's funny when people think
I'm actually wearing leather pants and
they're like I ring leather leggings I'm
like yeah and then it's really cute and
i love this hardware on the outside
obviously I wouldn't like open the
zipper that would be sketch but zipper
down is super cute as long as you don't
cover it was like an other boot that I
have another pair from what seal that I
haven't worn yet either and it's just
these crosses and I haven't found a time
to wear these yet because i feel like i
might even though i don't feel like you
have to cover your butt when you wear
leggings these ones are very see-through
ins thin which i didn't realize when I
got them um so I'll wear a tunic e shirt
when I wear this to make sure most of my
butt is covered so anyway it's just
crosses and Kostas I believe are still
in I know it was a huge trend in 2012
but I love these so much and they're
very detailed I'm probably wear a longer
ish plain black or white top with them
so I could cover my butt and I didn't
have too much like other designs and
patterns going on to distract away from
these cross pattern leggings then I have
from forever 21 my camel leggings and i
got these when i was in washington DC i
love these my camo sadly is kind of
going out it's not totally going out cuz
i'll still wear my camo dress and stuff
but it isn't as big as obviously 2012
was in the summer of 2013 was with camo
nothing bad about these which there were
ten eighty from forever 21 um so they're
a little more expensive because they
were patterned but they're like fading
and they weren't this like light green
and grey and brownish color when I got
them there are more vibrant and cute and
now they faded so I can kind of slowly
stopped wearing these as you know as
much as I used to last year because like
they're so faded and they look like I
warned them a hundred times and they're
all like washed out and I'm like yeah
what but I just will keep these in case
they have a camo day where I feel that I
need to wear camouflage and last but not
least I have my gojane galaxy leggings
I love you so much as they're really
cute obviously the trend will eventually
fade but i'm really loving this and i
still feel like they're in trend because
they're so cool and i just love this
design there about 20 bucks on
gojane.com definitely check them out on
line they have a lot of leggings and a
lot of galaxies ones but I chose this
purple and blue ones and they're a
little baggy ish to make sure you get
like a size smaller than usual cuz I got
a small and I should have got an extra
small oh well so that was my legging
collection video I hope you enjoyed this
I hope you don't take this like
offensive or anything and be like Louise
or pans yeah hey but I like leggings and
I think they're pretty cool and everyone
else in my school apparently loves
leggings too so thank you for watching
subscribe to my channel I'm that girl 07
