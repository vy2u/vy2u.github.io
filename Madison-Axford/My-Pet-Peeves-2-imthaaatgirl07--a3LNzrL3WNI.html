not gonna tell you the the amount lend
blend blend but since my makeup is
darker than my Norwegian pale red
cheeked skin it's one of the greatest
things you can do is ask people how much
money they make they are not Uggs
they look like uggs they're not ugh what
bothers me with knock-offs is when
people claim that they're real like what
people will ask me you know how long
have you had an eating disorder
hey Elsa today I'm doing my pet peeves
number two video because I've already
done one of these and I have more pet
peeves than the normal person should
have but I love these videos I think
they're super duper funny to watch but
annoys people what gets on our nerves
even though it's kind of a awkward topic
to talk about like a 20 minute video
about my peeves and things I hate I
thought it'd be fun to do a part two
video because I got a lot of positive
feedback off of my first one even though
I also got some hateful comments about
how annoying it was anyway I don't have
that many this time I still have a good
amount because my pet peeves are never
ending but let's go ahead and get
started
my first pet peeve is when people think
I have an eating disorder because I'm
thinner than the usual person I am very
small I'm very petite you can often tend
to see my ribs and um no to clarify any
rumors or any questions I do not have an
eating disorder I never have had even
disorder I'm thankful for that I've
never had problems with my body my
weight I never thought I was fat and I
never ever had it eating disorder I
don't know
I eat what I want and my metabolism is
super high people will ask me you know
how long have you had an eating disorder
and I'm like
what no I don't have an eating disorder
it's just annoying when people think
that just because I do look smaller than
maybe someone else standing next to me I
haven't I have a problem I have it
eating disorder oh my goodness you know
and um
I feel so bad for the people that do
have them but I don't and I hate when
I'm questioned and criticized for my
weight and whether or not I do have one
it's just annoying and I get that all
the time the second thing is when you're
putting on your eyeliner liquid pencil
gel whatever you're using and it looks
like amazing it looks a boss on one side
and then the other side literally looks
like you got a black eye yeah I've been
there done that every day of my life I
always have one side that's totally
amazing the other side's just a mess
I'm sure tons of people can relate to
this but it totally totally sucks oh my
goodness but you know what can you do
you just gotta erase it and try again
number three happens to me all the time
it's when girls start ridiculous stupid
unnecessary drama okay
whether it's spreading rumors making fun
of you whatever it is and then when you
try to like stand for yourself are you
trying to question them about it and
like why are you doing this they blame
you for something they're like if you
have a problem talk to me or I'm not
gonna forgive you until you talk to me
and you're just like why am I being
forgiven what did I do to you you know
people start this stuff and then they
act like you're the way I got it you're
the one that's spreading all this drama
crayons drama and it annoys the crap out
of me to have it so so often the poor
thing is when people don't take my
YouTube seriously I do i do take YouTube
seriously I consider it a huge huge part
of my life it's a fun activity and it's
also a job I see YouTube as an amazing
outlet for my creative abilities with
makeup fashion and stuff like that and
talking to you guys but life and advice
and when people laugh at it and make fun
of it I think it's a joke don't think
I'm serious think I'm you know your
videos are stupid and annoying okay I
didn't just spend three hours on that
video you know it's annoying when people
think what I do is just like record
myself and put it up on the Internet to
get some views no I edit I upload I get
ready for my videos I export in HD I've
saved money to afford bites in a camera
and suffer this and pucks that I bite
you know and I spent so much time and
money and effort on my videos and I'm
not
do you everyone to you know love them
but I hate when people think it's just
some fun after-school activity and or or
it's a joke and it's like it annoys me
so much the fifth thing is also YouTube
related it's when people ask me how much
I make from YouTube this is literally
the most annoying thing anyone can do I
have children asked me I have students
ask me I have teachers ask me I have
adults ask me and people act like I
should be like flattered that people are
asking me that
but it's seriously one of the most
annoying things you can do I don't know
if I've said this before in a video I
think I have I think I did some I hope a
piece video but it happens literally
every day I people I get people come out
from you in like how much do you make
how did she make a few how'd she make up
videos how do you make money like yes I
do make money off stage that I do make
money because it is cool and a lot of
people do here on YouTube we do make
money your revenue or income you know
some some people do if you're partnered
with a company um but I don't think
people realize how annoying that is am I
going to your house knocking on your
door asking how much your dad makes how
much your mom makes no so you know um
it's just annoying because part of the
contract is that it's a secret so when
people ask me how much I make I'm not
gonna tell you the the amount you know
I'll either make up a random number I've
done that a lot or I just will kind of
avoid it and not say I've never told
anyone how much is actually on the check
there's no set rate either for hi my
timings off my YouTube videos and it's
annoying as farts when people ask me so
you know if you know some that makes
money whether it be from YouTube or
she's a job that's wanted to reduce
things you can do is ask people how much
money they make so don't do that that's
so annoying
number six is when you say how much you
love an artist a song an album or
whatever a record and then people make
fun of you for it like I'll be like oh I
love many Cyrus I love Nicki Minaj I
like pretty Spears um Iggy Azalea Ke$ha
Justin Bieber whoever the heck it is you
like and
people are like oh my god that's decides
oh my god you like pop 40 I'm guys I
heard that in the radio that's stupid oh
oh you only like pop and rap yeah I do
like pop and rap okay
I do like pop and rap and you and then
people are like oh that's bad music
that's bad quality music oh that's use
here that mclubbe that's not good
quality music oh what happened to the
music world but what is music today like
sorry that you like 70s rock bands and
scream of music but not everyone likes
that so don't make me feel offended for
my music taste if I share it you know to
the world people literally will always
comment on my music case how stupid it
is not on YouTube but like comment just
at school or on Twitter and it's
annoying yes because I'm like I like
these songs I'm not counting on your
music or the music you listen to or your
music taste so don't be rude to mine
number seven when you'll tell someone
that you're on your period whether or
not it be a guy or a girl and then the
guy like freaks out okay that is so
aggravating because yes all girls have
to go through periods okay it happens
every month so what if I'm like I'm on
my period and guys really like oh my god
you know like I'm not like showing you
I'm just telling you so it's like I
don't know I don't think a period of
sigh can be ashamed of or scared up or
embarrassed by because every girl has it
so when guys act immature annoying or
disrespectful about it it annoys me so
much because like every girl goes
through it so special girl who only has
this every girl does go through it so
it's annoying when they act like you see
the grossest thing never ate when people
tell you that they can see your makeup
line
um yes you can see my makeup line
probably often I try start blend blend
blend but since my makeup is darker than
my Norwegian pale red cheek skin you can
often see my makeup line no matter how
much I try to blend it in and when
people tell me that like that's so rude
like I owe you can see it I tried really
hard and sorry if you can see but people
would be like I can see your makeup line
okay does that affect you in any way
shape or form no goodbye number nine
people who just stare you like take a
picture it'll last longer
like you'll be looking at hallway
walking through the mall walking on the
street and walking anywhere and people
will just be like I don't nothing look
at your glance see you but like look and
then just stare their eyes are glued on
you why you walking past them wherever
you're going or if you know even if
you're sitting down you just keep
staring at you it's so annoying like
stop looking at me like you know it's
fine to look at me but don't just like
number 10 is when I wear high heels to
school and people will be like oh my god
buddy wear heels school oh my god who
wears heels to school like sorry that I
like feeling dressed up and and and nice
and pretty and I try it's go I'm not
rolling out of bed putting my hair in a
bun wearing sweatpants and Uggs
I'm trying trying I'm trying to put an
effort into my appearance and how I look
I don't care if you like you know wear
some pants were or wear Uggs that's fine
but don't be like criticizing me or what
I'm wearing like oh my why are you
writing yells just go oh my gosh what if
you fall how do you walk like I can walk
in heels so I ate once a problem there
if you're barely making it across the
hallway without putting onto a locker or
rail that might be a problem but since I
can strut my stuff in my heels you know
I see no problem there number 11 is
knockoffs but not just knockoffs because
I understand completely that people some
people can't afford you know $3,000
purses most people can't I can't but
what bothers me knock-offs is when
people claim that they're real like what
the hell no okay so if you're walking
around in uggs and they don't have the
UGG label on the back of them they are
not up
they look like uggs they're not ugh Tom
knock-offs not Tom's Sperry knockoffs
knots various you're not claimed then
they are Sperrys Tom's us because they
look like it also if you're carrying
around a fake Louie Vuitton coach Gucci
Kate Spade Oscar de la Renta any kind of
really famous big purse company and you
claim it's the purpose this happens so
much with Louboutins and Rebecca Minkoff
and Michael Kors they are not those
person oh and coach like the G no okay
no that's not it so you know it's fine
if you do carry that around it but when
people say oh I just got this leave ton
bag from where down the street under
garage so no that's not real Louis
Vuitton that's not real coach it's not
real whatever so don't pretend that it's
real you it's okay if you hear your
knockoff I'm not making fun or looking
down upon people who do you
I personally don't carry knockoffs
because I'm not gonna try to pass that
off as a real thing cuz I feel like
that's why there are knockoffs to try to
look like real ones and I just rather
not have it at all then carry a knockoff
but if you do want to carry a knockoff
that's totally fine but don't tell
people that it's actually like that
because it's not it's not never twelve
when people are rude for no reason at
all I had this a lot because people that
make fun of me for my youtube channel
I've never really talked to ever in my
life I've never even talked to you
you're being rude for no reason because
I have nothing against you until now
I've never ever even like known you you
know so we don't know each other so why
are you being rude about what my hobby
what I love to do I'm not being rude
about what you like to do so goodbye
number 13 is when people only wear
athletic shorts or sweats all the time I
know this might sound fruit and I really
don't want this video to but this video
is kind of a negative video it's kind of
funny but this is what bothers me when
people wear sweats oh intern and when
they wish athletic shorts like Nike
shorts whatever um all summer all spring
like I know you have jeans I know you
have pants you have to have other pants
than that so why is that all you're
wearing I know comfort might be a huge
factor in a lot of people's wardrobes
it's not in mine like how comfortable I
feel is literally last on my list look
at the fierce arse on the top of my list
so and I'm not saying that everyone has
to look fearsome wear heels no no no no
no but in your own sweats and athletic
shorts are totally fine they're
completely I don't resent great fine
whatever but when you wear them you know
seven days a week every week it's kind
of annoying and I've hurt a lot of
people about this and it's just like I
know just a concern me but I don't know
it's like that's all you wear like just
when people don't try with their clothes
like I know you have this bum days you
can happen for in five days of the
school week but at least one day dress
up wear shorts wear jeans leggings at
least I mean come on babe all number 14
is when you don't know what you are with
guy and what a guy doesn't know what he
is with you whether your friends own or
if you are almost saving or if your
boyfriend you know it's like when you're
confused about what you are because
there's so many mixed signals and you
just this happens to me wait wait wait
wait too much and it sucks it's such a
struggle because I never know when I am
with with guys and it sucks because you
don't to make a move and then want to
make a move and you just stay in this
awkward position which is where you
don't know what you are like forever and
never 15 my last one is when people wear
underwear with leg games I'm not talking
thumb song is what I wear with leggings
I don't go commando with leggings so
it's kind of weird and it actually kind
of gross and you can probably see your
camel toe wear it wear a song that's
perfectly normal great science you see
no lines on your boot a bit when I walk
into class and I see someone wearing
leggings okay with granny panties I'm
talking the full outline of the
underwears being seen on your butt and
he'll be like well why are you looking
and I'm like I'm not trying to look but
they turned around their butts right
there and all you can see is line it's
just everywhere from their under range
so many people do this I don't know if
they don't know I used to be like oh my
god I read you move with leggings but
then I grew up and I realized that it's
kind of common sense you don't wear
underwear with super superduper you're
freaking
pants let's see that line so I hope you
enjoy my pet peeves part 2 video this
was really fun
again if you're gonna leave a comment
saying how mean or rude or obnoxious I
was don't because that's what this video
is kind of meant to be is supposed to be
funny and it points out the stuff that I
hate the things that I don't like so I
hope you enjoyed this video if you're
not already chicken why would you
subscribe to my channel and become a
fierce and competent diva like me and
the rest of us on here my pet peeves
