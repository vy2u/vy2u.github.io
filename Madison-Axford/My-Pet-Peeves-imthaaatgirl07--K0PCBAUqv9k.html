that's called my pet peeves and if you
know me you know that I am easily
angered and a lot of things freakin get
on my last nerve a lot of things that
may seem ordinary or you know wouldn't
get on normal people's nerves but a lot
of things do and I hope you guys can
relate to them so that this video is an
oyster your time obviously as a
disclaimer I'm not pointing this at any
certain person I don't know why anyone
would think that but do you always get
those comments that are like oh my gosh
you were so rude oh my gosh oh could you
sing that no I'm not saying that this
one person in my school name blah blah
blah does this no I'm not saying that
but um these are just things that get on
my nerves that I've seen throughout my
16 years of life from all different
people around the world different
genders whatever okay so um this video
is gonna sound really angry yeah it's
gonna sound really annoyed and I'm
really happy person and but I don't need
people commenting saying why are you so
angry why are you so rude why are you so
mean like I just I just don't want that
because it is supposed to be kind of
light kind of funny kind of joking but
these things do that my nerves I'm not
gonna like freak out someone does this
but they just get on my nerves like
these things are annoying to me like
everyone has a pet peeves ever everyone
has those things that are annoying to
them I just want to share them with you
and and yeah I hope you guys don't take
this too literally I don't you guys
don't freak out or like just like this
video and I hope you really enjoyed so
let's get right into the video I've
quite a long wait along with first timer
list is when people ask me for gum and
obviously I'm a hypocrite when I say
this because I have asked people
forgotten but when I asked for people
for gum it's like an emergency I either
have like dry mouth
or I have like disgusting breath or I
have a weird taste in my mouth from some
food I ate or something and I'm not just
like unborn do you know gum no it's like
we're in high school so if you can't you
know get a dollar of your own money to
buy yourself $8 it's 99 cents a pack of
gum then something is wrong because when
I admire a pack of gum for myself and
that pack we got this for myself
yeah I'll share with the close a few
close friends hope sharing it with me
before at my family but when like random
people are like okay yay gum and you
can't say no and you're like did I
I respect gum to share with you no no no
I didn't I didn't I didn't I didn't
share with you you know it is just so
aggravating this is like it's my own
money that I've made yeah it's a dollar
but I freaking works with this money and
Russia's gonna like if you use nobody to
give you gum and supply you with that
first number two isn't which I don't
think it's when you're on YouTube and it
buffers oh my goodness I have full bars
on my computer and still somehow someway
the videos on YouTube will find ways to
buffer some ones that I'm like dynasts
and you're like you know once there's
like a billion hits am I gonna do you
see this video and it's just like you
like pause it wait for the little like
thing to go all the way across thank you
it's so aggravating it's like come on
YouTube come on first number three is
creepers there's not much I need to say
about this but when you're on Facebook
and you get those people they're like I
see you in the hallways I want to I love
you it was so cool you boy so pretty can
you send me a picture no I can't
it's just there's not much you can say
meta but people just are so creepy and
you can find ways to talk to people
without seeming like an absolute creeper
but it's like it's the people that to
say the most abrupt and disturbing
things and you're just like dully block
do you friend go away for me first
okay next is when guys are like oh yeah
because I'll be like I don't want to
annoy you like when I text you know cuz
like I don't want to seem like I'm
texting all the time or I'm clean you
know no it's fine text me every day oh
my god I want to talk to you know like
thanks and so then if something happens
to penis we stop talking or something
and then like somehow the word gets
around and people are like hey blah blah
why did she stop talking to Madison and
they'd be like she texts me way too much
hey my guys are like no text me oh my
gosh and then they're like oh she texts
too much she's clingy like first next is
when people breathe when they eat and no
I'm not saying breathing in you know and
breathing out I'm talking about like
when they sound like they're making out
with like their food like it eating
they're like
and I'm like Italy I need so freakin
leave the table if you're doing that
I've done that before
like I'll just sing people and they'll
be like like could you not breathe or
when people are just like like sitting
at a desk absolutely doing nothing it's
totally like freezing in the classrooms
let's do the air conditioning they
didn't know physical activity during
that day and they're just like are you
freaking out are you nervous what is
your problem because they're just like
such a loud breather like could you
freaking freaking freaking stop it's I
just can't take it I hate that noise
first next to some people stuff in my
shoes in the hall air out in public um
if you do it the first time it really
makes me mad but I'm like whatever it's
an accident I've done that before the
second time it's like are you joking and
then when they continue to do it or they
like get your shoe off your freaking
heel and you have to stop in the middle
of where you the hallway or put the
store wherever you are to put on your
shoe and they don't say anything they're
just like like you're in their way I had
this person some issue four times once
first next is how uggs always make you
trip like I don't understand my uggs
always seemingly are able to make you
trip like you just kind of like you know
slide your feet around and then you
always find ways to trip and Uggs no
other it was just paws I don't I
don't I don't know if the material on
the bottom I don't know there you just
always trip it up first next is when
people ask if my nails are real like why
doesn't even concern you why does it
matter if I if I spend money to get
myself you know nice nails from salon
why do you care why do you care
no they're not real and I'll be like oh
no they're acrylic and then people are
like okay like uh first next is when
people ask how much money I make often
YouTube um I work at Panera and people
never asked me how much money I made
there so it's really annoying when
people do I reason they care about my
YouTube is like they're like oh so how
much do you make cuz they might be
interested in it I'm saying it's like
okay I'm partnered with stylehaul and
through a contract were really not
supposed to tell anyone how much we make
it's private it's
and if the amount the amount
differentiates every month based on
viewers and subscribers it and amount of
use you get in videos you put up and
stuff like that and so I'm not just
gonna go out and be like oh I make blah
blah like and and I'm gonna do that
anyway I would feel so rude you go up
someone be like how much money do you
make like that sometimes like someone's
father I mean like Oh should my using
right to support your family like you
just don't do that and that's rude and
like I'm not gonna tell you like I'm not
going to tell you how much money I make
I'll beat you first X is when people
fart and burp loudly in public or in
your house I just cannot stand it I when
people just burnt and they think it's
funny or when they fart no smells okay
like farting I know I haven't heard as
much or seen as much or smelt as much
since I was like a little in elementary
school but burping is absolutely
disgusting and when you're in the
hallway or when you're asked to dinner
or something and people just like oh and
you're like like these people from other
tables or your other groups of friends
are like staring at you and it's like
embarrassing and you're just like I'm
not messing up with them it's disgusting
keep it in I don't get why people can't
I seriously never broken public and
they're and I drink soda all the time
every day
it's like you can hold it in or muffle
it or go to go somewhere else where it's
not in front of people total and when
people like let out a big belch and
they're like oh that was a good one Oh
No uh first when they just freakin are
in class and they asked me for a pen a
pencil
we've been in class we're in we're
seniors now so if you ask me for a
freaking pencil after year what 12th
13th year of school I'm gonna say no I'm
gonna be like oh I don't have any how
can you not remember to bring paper and
a pen to class like I just don't
understand some people's logic and what
goes through their minds like what do
you think you need to bring to class
like cellphones and headphones no pen
and paper first okay that comes first
it's just like people doing give me a
pen pen pen pencil yeah um sorry I don't
I don't have those either first when
people repeatedly ask me what now the
first time in Vegas I'm
so when I have to sing long story I'll
be like oh my gosh did you watch the
race episode of Cuba with the
Kardashians and yeah I talk fast but
before like what did you watch the
leaves episode of Keeping Up with the
Kardashians and then people would be
like we play and I'm just like ok never
mind because it seriously wasn't that
important nothing is that important to
repeat 2 or 3 times 1 times fine and I
do got some pens bumpy were just like
what waited web sorry wait I'm really
kidding what like no like it if you
can't hear it that many times it's just
like not meant to be heard first when
people don't flush the toilets
god this aggravates me too right
I just I can't I can't do it I can't
when I go into school where there's
people 14 and 15 to like ages 18 19 and
you walk into a stall and and there's
pee or poop in the stall I just don't
understand especially poop because it's
absolutely disgusting but I suppose no
not especially poop both of them you pee
you flush it's not gonna clog the toilet
so it's not like you clogged it it you
flush the toilet if you're scared to
touch it touch it with your shoe flush
the freaking toilet it's not that hard
or if you poop and you just leave it
chill in there cuz you know the next
person's really gonna enjoy that you
know looking at that flushing it I just
don't get why people who have been going
to the bathroom every day for a billion
days in their life cannot freakin Lauren
how getting it up and turn down or push
a button or whatever the heck you're
doing and it's just like orbity go out
in public places maybe it was a kid so
I'll forgive public places a little more
you know maybe it was like a
five-year-old and for god it's high
school and seriously I don't even
remember the last time I went to a stall
and there wasn't something you know a
surprise waiting for me there first one
day we're like oh my gosh I need to show
you this really really funny dog video
on YouTube like no like that's also a
good long look at this new picture of my
dog look at this new picture of my cat
we'll get my bunny like I don't I don't
care I just I just don't care well it's
funny for you somebody that's like
smiling like
no like I mean and I may seem rude I
know all these might sound rude but it's
like I don't like animals
and I don't want waste me time watching
a video of an animal or like looking at
a picture I'm at your dog like I'm not
gonna be like oh it's not so I'll be
like mm-hmm and people are like I'll be
like sorry echoing animals um it's not
I'm not hating on you it's just like I
don't think they're I don't think that's
cute
first when people complain about the use
of hashtags on Instagram I'm an
instrument whether or not you want to
put hashtags so yes I'm going to take
advantage of that and what people were
like when they tweet they're like when
people used to have shown Instagram and
then they do like bunch of those like
less than but like little like things
like that's I'm like the less than sighs
you know when people like just like
something and they're like oh my gosh so
when people put a lot of hashed choice
and that's sure in like then don't look
at my picture don't follow me don't like
it like it's really like I don't care if
you don't if like you like hashtags or
not I like them because other people
then my followers can see my pictures
and they'll gain new followers or
whatever and it's like if you don't like
that I'm sorry but I like doing that and
when people can play about it it's so
annoying
first when new people come to school and
act like you don't know what you're
doing like when you'll be like let me
like where's the bathroom and you're
like I was this way and they're like no
actually there's a shorter way to get to
the bathroom and I'm like oh really
because last time I checked I've been
here for the last four years and you've
been here two hours oh you know if
you're gonna ask me a question don't
correct me first we don't use their
signal when they're driving this anyways
the crap out of me because I'll be going
like fasting on something like slow down

and warn me
why is there a signal why is that such a
big part in the drivers guide why is
that such a big part of little like
getting your license on that drivers

your signal it's there for a reason to
whine people to repent crashes - people
are too lazy to freakin turn the button
on for three seconds first when I go to
a restaurant and I want a smaller
portion so I'm gonna wear off the kids
menu and people act like I just commit

if you want to read people's text
without them knowing and don't have that
option for people to see open couple
snapchats like don't open if you're not
gonna response and just gets freaking
freaking awkward up in here and I'm
gonna be like was that
not upset that snatch first when you

people like obviously judge you with
facial expressions like I want into like

people were like like I couldn't even
freaking touch anything and I'm like
okay you don't know how much money I

people don't understand what a personal
space or personal bubble means and when

of my face I was there so like that come
and be like okay and this I mean like
they were six not like they had bad
breath I just don't want you all to
breathe it on me talking to me or when

general when you walk by and you can't
walk by without being harassed make
people really try this new shampoo come
on straighten your hair can I sell you
this purse can I sell you these shirts
like it know if I wanted that I would
come to you so get away from me and
they're like they like cheese together

handle
I just especially like in a class I mean
they're like like just how about first
urban people scratch it's not just like
I got sad but when people are like and

skin particles like going into the air
off their skin it's just like oh that's
toe scratching are you trying to like

in store and then be like
like if you hear that going on and like
try to do this sorry
you know try to stop it don't be like oh
the song or be like they sing out it's
so annoying especially when it's like
dongnam style like how many times can
you really really gone that's I like
people um and they listen the whole song
and yours like turn ring do it off turn
it off or when they have like dog
barking or something really really loud
or not just annoying ringtone that no
one whatever choose and that's the right
tone they just like first next is people
who prank call
um we're not in fourth grade anymore so
you can get off your little iPhone star
67 move on with your life um it's not I
don't care about it it's like oh I don't
think it's funny anymore eh you stupid
it's just obnoxious if you're an ass
junior senior in high school and you
really can't find anything better to do
with your life then prank call me and be
like this is the Chinese restaurant Oh
first let me for you when people use the
word ironic wrong like I don't know if
you know what the word ironic means I
just when people were like oh my gosh I
think the color yellow you did too oh my
god you that is so ironic how is that
ironic first um
improper use of their they're in there
if you made it past the fourth grade or
third grade or whenever you learn
grammar basic grammar you would know
that these artists first when people
touch my neck it's just a kid handler
people like to me you're like grabbing
at the first when people consistently
ask me why are you with the fork like
I've explained it to you like a hundred
times because I'll answer when people
ask me I've explained in videos and then
d blade might find me they like you put
the forks you're in germs what it that's
not really saying to be made fun of so
you can go shave you back now first what
I might always have people like even if
there's a teeny bit sad like I'll care
for them I'll be like oh my god I'm here
for you if you need anything
and then once I'm bad or sad happens me
they're like ooh that sucks
well bye I gotta go first when I have my
video on YouTube
and within the first like ten minutes
there's already like what did she
dislikes and I just don't do the people
that go on there and just like video so
quickly this video might get a little
you know some dislikes because it is
harsh and its major opinions that I'm
sorry if that doesn't you know if that
makes you angry it's not towards you
it's just feelings about who matter to
you it's like when I spent hours on end
creating ideas for videos filming them
editing them getting up set up for them
adding effects then uploading them and
then I just you just like do you like do
you not understand much time put into
this and after what I put into this and
how much I care about my videos and what
it's shown on my channel and my channel
is a whole it's like and you just like
just like that like it's fine if you get
those haters everyone sno-isle but
people who just like go through and just
like every one of my videos is just like
first and lastly it's when I talk to a
guy and people are like oh so you like
blah blah blah and then it's just like
can I not freaking talk to the opposite
sex without you thinking that I'm like
in love with them like I'm feeling like
hey so I saw you in the way mm-hmm okay
voice crack okay okay and then they'll
be like oh are you going out no no we're
not first suppose maybe I hope I did
sound too much like a sarcastic and wing
but um it's just like those are the
things that annoy me again I'm not
putting this at any certain person um if
this hurts you in any way please message
me privately and I'll apologize because
I don't mean to point out any group or
people or any person in particular in
and this is just stuff that everyone
probably does once in their life and
it's just stuff that I found gets on my
nerves supposed to be like whatever
funny lol video and I wasn't gonna be
like I'm gonna point out certain people
and maybe let me know so don't just just
like this video because you just like
saying I said but anyway I hope there
are those people out there who took this
more lightly and laughed and just had a
good time watching it like I had a good
time creating it and filming it and um
check back later for my videos follow me
on Instagram Twitter vine and Tumblr
like me on Facebook and just subscribe
to this channel so thanks for watching
