feel like every girl needs a bubble
necklace you might not want to be gaudy
one like I'm wearing that you're going
on a safari with this necklace yeah halo
such a day i'm doing a video that i've
been super super excited to do i just
haven't done it in the past because i've
been trying to collect enough to do a
collection video which is my statement
necklace like thorium on collection i
have 10 statement atlases statement
necklaces are life and i love them
they're beautiful they had everything to
an outfit they totally complete it and i
thought i'd show you which ones i have
and um yeah hopefully you can find
similar ones you can get a lot of
turning Charlie's or forever 21 as a lot
and you should definitely check out
source like so so that further ado let's
get into this video and I'll start off
with the one on my neck so this is a
very very very beautiful one I love the
mint green and royal blue color that um
is shown here um I got this one from
forever 21 and I love it you can pair
with really anything but I just paired
it with this nice sheer white top and I
just loved how big and chunky it is say
my necklaces if you don't know what they
are are just really big chunky sometimes
gaudy necklaces that are just really
really large and yes this is my first
one and I love the colors on this one
and the detailing all the studs now I
don't know where like I got all this
next is but I do know where I got this
one from it's from the bubble necklace
store and Etsy or whatever and this is
my black bottle necklace with the gold
chain which I love this is such a beauty
guru necklace and I'm funny I don't
think there's anyone without a bubble
necklace and I decided to get my indie
most you know usable color which is
black you can really put this with any
outfit and it's super tingly and big and
it's huge this is my biggest statement
piece necklace but I just love this you
should definitely check them out I think
they have some similar ones at um
charlotte russe and term Chavez but not
forever 21 there but this is from the
Etsy store it's about 110 but there are
really cheaper once in stores so check
those a few don't want to spend as much
money but i love this fellow necklace
and i feel like every girl needs a
bubble necklace next I think this one's
from forever 21 or it might be from
macy's not really sure but it's a tribal
necklace and I love this one because it
has all these triangles and really
20 pieces and it's black and silver with
a gold chain honestly I bought it
because it looks so tri-valley and it
just adds a lot um more like high Sheikh
definition to an outfit um it really
spices it up and this is one of my more
like fancy looking ones and more
expensive looking ones I don't remember
if it was necessarily more expensive
than the others but it is smaller but it
is super duper cute as well next is from
charming charlies and it's this
beautiful light lavender and deep purple
statement necklace and its like it has
like two layers so if you have like a
really plain shirt you might want to add
this one with two layers to spice it up
I really like the how they're all ovals
yet they aren't different colors and I
just like how they're both purple
instead of like you know two three
colors even though I love this one this
one does stay with the same color just
lighter shades or darker shades and it's
really cute and really feminine looking
because the color you know apparently
I'm really bad at describing necklaces
as shown in this video next is also on
my favorites from nordstrom rack if this
pink coral and orange you want most of
my statement necklaces that I've seen so
far have like three main parts like 1 2
3's seen on this one in this money past
one I love the colors on the month on
this one the main reason I got it was
because of the colors and love coral and
it's perfect for like spring easter time
they kind of look like flower shape
semester I don't know but it's really
really pretty it makes an effort more
feminine like the purple one because you
know subway because of the color and it
just looks so girly and like sinful and
it's beautiful the next one isn't multi
media is a stimulus but it almost isn't
because of how small it is but it's just
a nice black one it's pi my least
favorite just because it's not big and I
almost didn't consider it a statement
necklace but it is almost like a choker
cuz the chains are small so on that made
me consider a statement necklace and it
wraps just a little loosely around the
neck so it is pretty tight this has
great detailing in each of these black
squares and it's just really simple to
add if you have maybe earrings in or at
somewhat detailed top you might want
just a simple one like this it gets
really really messed up entangled easily
but um you might not want to be gaudy
one like I'm wearing or something and
just like a little or one like this
that's why I have this simple one an
excellent is also one of my favorites is
pretty much the definition of gaudy I
love it
betsey johnson and it's just these huge
huge huge um red not pink reddish pink
jewels followed by this like chain this
double chain with like one side is pink
jewels and the other side's just a chain
link it's also pretty short but i love
it i love how the detailing doesn't just
stop here it goes all the way up the
chain and like little studs follow and
so i love this one see it looks so gaudy
but i do love it in the big fake jewels
that comes along with it the next was
probably one of my more expensive ones
other than the bubble necklace and i'm
pretty sure it's from macy's I'm so bad
remembering when these arcs I've had
some of them from a long time but it's
this really really fancy one and as you
can see it just looks really really you
know mature and like something you'd
wear liked it on a theatre play or
church or maybe a really expensive
dinner just something really really
really fancy because it is so like
delicate and so detailed and I would
wear a plain or shirt with this not with
too much detailing because of how big it
is and how much jewels and how she stuff
it has going on or ready with it but I
do love this my second to last one is
this like animal print it looks like
giraffe and I originally didn't really
like this but my mom convinced me to get
it and it has like 105 billion like
strings um and then is another shorter
one it's really pretty if you actually
like take a moment for it and actually
look at it is they're all these circles
are connected with like this little like
diamond detailing hook and I just really
like this to wear if I can give you a
brown shirt or if you're going to like a
party or something like that um it's
really like this my only animal print
equis and it's just really really cute
and tribal looking also in kind of like
I don't know sorry like you're going on
a safari with this necklace yeah and
lastly i have another Cornish pink one
and it's just like this it looks like
this carved stone raw kind of like um
look that came out in like 2 ko's moved
11 2012 i think just was really famous
and but i just got this from nordstrom
rack um and i love this color and i love
how they're all like uneven in different
shapes and it's a gold chain and it
looks like Little Rock's I just love
this one and it's also one of my
favorites so even though I pretty much
it in the
worst describe her up next as ever I
suck at it I hope I showed you how much
I love statement necklaces and how much
you should get interested in statement
necklaces because they totally make it
out that look that much more preppy chic
and beautiful so thank you for watching
