Balu look that I'm super happy and
excited to do I was on a lot of my
recent videos and everyone wanted me to
do the extra look that I did
incorporating these blue eyeshadows um
some are from L'Oreal summer from Le
colors I am in love with this look it's
my go-to look but recently because it is
Smoky and it's not an obnoxious blue
like it's a nice blue roof it goes from
white pearl ash color to a turquoise to
eat dark navy so definitely keep on
watching if you wanna see this look it's
a very wearable cool tone blue eye look
and I am obsessed with it so yes keep on
watching okay the first thing I'm taking
is my Mac's fix plus love this stuff it
just makes my face all dewy and applies
the foundation easier I'm taking my
covergirl three and one am I in followed
by L'Oreal my two like all-time favorite
foundations that you something like
every tutorial I blend them together to
get like a better matching color for my
skin and then I put it on oh yeah I'm
laughing if I seem distracted this video
my sister was in my room like telling me
a story sorry I tried to cut it out as
much as I could some of the clips are
just funny though and laughing I don't
know sorry she was talk to me I'm sorry
anyway I'm just going to use my B runner
that I cleaned prior and dampened to
blend in my two mixed foundations into
my skin to cover up all the redness yes
then I'm gonna take my meth to conceal
Maybelline concealer this is also in my
go twos and I got um the color light I
think it is just to use it more of a
highlighter for my face for than
concealer so I put on my eyes down the
bridge of my nose forehead keep its bow
and chin as you can see just to even out
all the very highlighted places now so
it's not just one of my eyes because
then it would look up Allen's so then I
blend it all in with usually yeah there
we go the other side of my Beauty
Blender
so I'd written them both up but this one
just fits better under my eye that's I
didn't beautified another pointed one
and then I found this all in I do
realize how it looks like doesn't match
but we make it work we blend we make it
work
then I'm taking my covergirl
professional loose powder I love this
stuff it just it's very thick but it
sets the makeup all day long if you need
a good powder plenty check this one out
covergirl it's like five dollars it
lasts forever it's oh babe I just put
this all over my face especially my
t-zone just to sell the makeup and any
place is gonna make it shiny especially
around my nose I always get shiny there
but we're just gonna set that then I
take my Mac painterly paint-pot
my eye primer sometimes I will use a
concealer but it's a little wet and
greasy so I'll usually just go for this
thick clay oh then I'm really going to
my NYC smooth skin bronzer and sunshine
I think going in with a Basanti little
tapered brush and just carving out the
cheekbone that I desire the shape that I
want and do it on the other side and
then I will blend it out so it's not
just like a thick brown line and I think
I also go up to my temples like I always
do no just gettin nuttin this one okay I
think I put on my temples mayor cut that
clip out but I'm going in with one of my
favorite pressed pigments from L'Oreal
and followed by shadows and I'm not
Claire this is no it's iced latte I do
you know what this come on Madison iced
latte and I press it on with just a
ratchet like elf pressed brush this
trail was filmed before I got my role in
the inacol brushes but literally this
tutorial is film so long ago and I never
got it up cuz I did all these other
videos anyway taking my blue palette the
star the show and like colors and just
putting on a nice like light blue on my
midsection as a transition color between
my dark navy and my curl pressed pigment
that I will apply and did apply already
so this is just a nice transition color
and it really I don't know it's cute
it's a nice kind of blue then I'm taking
the blue navy L'Oreal in problem it's a
missionary midnight blue and going in
with another press like elf brush I'm
just kind of going in a v-formation and
putting this on the outer crease of my
lid and then I run these all together I
think with my Mac 217 se brush this is
before like I said I had my royal and
langnickel brush sets so I was using on
my ratchet like Miss match brushes I'm
just putting this in making sure it gets
dark enough and then I'm taking a
lighter blue yeah I went to some
Tennessee and blending it all in
together
to get a nice blue dark navy smokey eye
I love the slickness have been my little
go to look all the time I just got this
blue palette at the dollar store and I
was like hmm I'm gonna try to do a blue
look and then I did one day it looked
awful I tried again and then it just
kind of worked and I went from there and
everyone really likes it so we can do so
much for a question miss and how much
you know how much you want to see this
it was one of my most highly requested
videos ever and it just took me so long
to do it but yeah I love it I think it's
a very wearable blue smokey eye and it's
fun then I'm taking my ELF liquid liner
and doing just a little nut little it's
a big a swing and I'm applying falsies
as well on my ELF natural ash to do a
lash peel you know the drill these are
my all-time favorites that I reuse and
reuse and reuse anyway a winged liner is
I found an easier way to do it now I
picked a font on the light and do it
here it was littering me free-handing
and I can't even draw a line so this is
jungle but we got through it together
yeah nice once I clean so
then taking my ELF natural not natural
one brow gel we're just gonna swap off
those eyebrows and then glue on Jack
because they were a little ratchet
before I could glue them down I was like
like were you watching these comes back
I was like oh my god fix the eyebrows
girl fix the eyebrows but as you know I
want to show you here I don't fill in my
eyebrows using my natural ones so we
just go down to this state in their
shape in their place
bitch get and your crates of that here's
my lashes for elf natural lashes make
sure the glue gets tacky and sets a
little before you applied that other way
so slide all over the place you know the
drill and lashes and wings they're
beautiful but the hardest friggin things
to do so this is me attempting to yeah
no oh yeah yeah there we go putting on
lashes
man I'm taking my breath a champagne pop
draclyn hill highlighter and
highlighting such eeks I don't really
like doing voiceovers I'm sorry that
this one was - voiceover somebody said
it was my sister was in the room and I
was like oh here I am hey lady my aunt
punch my nose and my cupids bow under my
DJ click lipstick I love this stuff
anyway like I was saying my sisters my
rooms that's why I had to do a voiceover
now but I usually just talk to my
tutorials which one you like better
voiceover but music or like me to talk
you through I'm talking about whatever
so I'm just playing this and using this
lip liner going to draw turn you down my
shape of my need yes I don't know what
color this is I'll try to find it in put
in the description box but don't hold me
to that then I'm taking an old wet one
color I think it's like stone edge or
something and just making it a little
more deep over the brown color except
wasn't as brown as I wanted
I'm taking my mana lip gloss from
boxycharm and applying at the center of
my lip top and bottom and there we go Oh
benefit they're real blue mascara love
it love it love it
this was also one of the highlights of
this video was it's a blue look so Bri
