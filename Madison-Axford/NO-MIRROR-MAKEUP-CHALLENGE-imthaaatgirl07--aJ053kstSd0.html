makeup challenge I've never done this
before I've been really scared to UM
force or wrap like all my mirrors have
been removed from my room it's no
there's no reason to try cheat I'm not
trying to prove myself in any way like I
don't want people viq added me are like
literally I don't have a mirror at all
around me I think that it would just be
the stupidest thing like it's just like
what are you trying to prove that you
could you make up like okay doing maker
tutorial I'm doing this just because I
want to see how bad I actually am it
makeup and how much you need a mirror my
contacts like around right now
but anyway um yeah I'm kind of nervous
because I know it's going to turn out
bad really not trying to prove anything
I think I think that it's going to be
proven from this is that I should stick
to reacting videos and not makeup okay
so um yeah let's just let's get started
I guess I will start with I guess I'll
just like stare down here like I feel
like weird like looking around
so I'll just stare down like literally
look at this I'm proving that there's no
mirror I'm proving there's no mirror we
go no mirror okay so anyone who thinks
three Mirek can suck Mac prep and prime
let's go oh we're off to a bad start
I feel like closing my eyes maybe close
my eyes the entire time I don't know
apparently where my eyes are it's also
very weird cuz I don't want to like try
to attempt to explain what I'm doing
because like there's no pointing like
why would you want to know how to do
this shoddy makeup job okay um taking my
morphe favorite little blending brush in
makeup geek creme brulee let's just go
in okay
you don't know what creases hope you
guys can see this
this is just like a nice transition
color oh hello
okay not feeling too bad like should i I
was gonna stick to like doing in easy
makeup look but then like I'm not gonna
like I don't know like half-assed do
this like let's do a hard smoke guy
let's go for it
woof my contacts are freaking okay I'm
gonna take my runway Nicole super
blended tapered blending now Master Pro
yeah super blending and um what should
we do I guess I'll just go for this bit
in color like I'm gonna do an Amber
smokey eye right now okay I'm really
trying to do well but I think this just
proves that I shouldn't do makeup I can
you make it with Mir all right
may I kick it on like a mother but like
I can do it okay but this is just
proving that I'm not nikkietutorials and
I'm not Chaplin Heil
I'm not an expert not a makeup artist I
guess this is enough I don't know okay
I'm going to get a flat top brush and
straight a 6 5 second Hollanders kayo
this is a focus like goodness this
L'Oreal infallible amber rush shadow
which I love I keep thinking I need a
mirror put it just on the middle of my
eye look
okay
and this always causes fallout so I can
literally feel fallout on my face so
let's just brush that away okay well I
think I'm done with the eyes
maybe I should blend it a little more
okay go in with some lion oh I
don't know how hard this gonna be okay
Oh oh god okay I'm not doing a wing
you really gotta like feel like this
like feels differently like when I look
and do it like at a mirror it doesn't
feel like this this feels weird like I
don't are my ions it's a different
feeling is so weird
okay then I need to line up my tight
line
oh okay I'm chief ace better the sex
waterproof to prepare for lashes
I'm really trying hard like I hope to
screw up let's do this one more time um
okay this is going to be hard because I
can barely do this with a mirror I'm shy
why tell us eyelash glue is tacky I feel
like I'm looking into the cameras much
more because the like um screen whatever
is flipped um so hey oh my god okay oh
oh okay I got to think I got it
I think I got it I felt a little blue
down there
okay awesome I think I got it okay let's
do the second one
feeling good
oh my god I think I got that I literally
think I got that both perfect yes okay
it feels like on the lash line okay yay
moving on to primer I'm using just a
little Becca backlight primer I don't
wanna use too much because this is kind
of a waste but going to apply it all
right and then I'm going to go in with
my Maybelline fit me and I just put this
on this is as hard as I thought was
going to be if you like I'm genuinely
doing an okay job
just gonna make sure to cover my entire
face okay I think that is good enough um
er I'm just taking my mac prolongwear
concealer huh why are you squirting at
me right now okay I'm just kind of
putting this on
why am i making sound effects really
unnecessary okay now I'm gonna take a
Beautyblender and just dab this in
huh think I put too much on
I'm lucky that I've such like a routine
I guess I make up like I know where I
put my concealer like I know where I put
myself um so I don't think it's going to
be that bad in the end the lashes might
be a little wonky but really hoping for
a good turnout okay should I bake Oh
chunking a bit you know I'm going to
bake with this RCM a powder here we go
should make it more difficult oh good
okay I like forgot what my Roisin is
what am i doing okay bronzer I was like
what do I do next oh oh
feel the cheekbone there you go girl
Beautyblender
okay
okay now I'm going to pin it almost done
okay gluing down the brows well couldn't
find my brother okay but we can do
lipstick which is Mac angel usually
we're myth now if it's a this we're
going back to the og angel feel like I
missed a spot
hey Joker okay we just get a finished
face um I guess I'll add a little more
bronzer from the NSSE you gleam palette
the glow kit I still have okay let's
wash off this powder or brush off
hmm okay I'm gonna go in with crush
pearl from Anastacio for highlight and I
think this is the last step
oh well lower lashes I guess nose Buddha
Cupid's bow there we go don't mess this
up girl
oh I think we're done I think we're
done okay
um I guess always you finish spray it
with some NYX matte finish spring eh I
think we're done I guess I just need a
mirror which I'll go get and I won't
look at till I come back on the screen
anyway okay we go get the mirror here's
my mirror and it'll be over oh oh oh
no well oh I mean it could be worse um I
don't know what the Frick is huh I don't
know okay I gotta fix it I don't know
what's happening with like I guess was
the finishing spray it probably would
have been better if the finishing spray
hadn't smeared everything we just cut
like a little mascara everywhere okay
it's really not that bad you're just a
fuse okay well it kind of is really bad
there's just a few like smears
okay well definitely gonna be worse um
let's see the lashes aren't that bad
holy crap like the bottom lashes I have
like two but like I'm lucky I have
eyebrows oh I don't do anything to the
lashes art are glued pretty well oh the
eyeliners lower of I mean the eyeliner
is awful the lashes I'm like kind of
living with nose highlight I mean I got
the highlight the bronzer okay I didn't
do this beause I thought I would
I just like really missed my nose with
auntie hello
let's cover that up okay well it's not
that bad I could go out in public and
not be stared at so I think this is a
win I hope you enjoy this video so um
