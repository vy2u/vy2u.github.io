in a part of my young I just want you to
be my doctor
hey guys so today I'm doing my night
routine which is basically just a
skincare routine but first I put my hair
up to get it out of my face and then I
go ahead and wash my hands to get all
the dirt and germs off my hands before I
start in and then I like to go unto my
iTunes radio and pick a more commerce
station like the Bobby Darin station I
love listening to his kind of music and
then I brush my teeth for my face first
I used my Neutrogena makeup remover
towelettes and then I remove any eye
makeup that I was wearing for the day
which I wasn't wearing that much today
but I use my Neutrogena eye makeup
remover which is really really great and
it's not oily which is what I love about
it and then I take my first aid Beauty
face cleanser to just wash my face
and then I'll use a skin toner usually I
have Neutrogena but I just picked up the
up-and-up Target brand recently and it
works just the same just to get any
extra dirt and grime off my face and
then after all that scrubbing and
rubbing I just like to go in with a
first aid Beauty facial radiance pad
just to brighten everything up and make
it all better exposed scrubbing in my
face for like an hour and then I use my
face day Beauty ultra Repair Cream just
to soothe my face and I love moisturize
my face with this I never use
moisturizer and this is just amazing I
don't know why I had never used it
before and then if you can't tell I
really love first aid beauty like face
products but I'm taking my eye cream
just to you know get it rid of any
puffiness or discoloration under my eyes
and then I take my Thursday Beauty lip
therapy and it's just a nice lip balm to
put on every night and it really shows
them if they're chapped and then I take
my favorite spa treatment of all time I
press the gel tan by clean and clear to
put on any acne that I have which I'm
going back to college tomorrow so I have
a lot of acne because I'm nervous and
I'm breaking out there's one hard word
don't
literally no joke I've had a nosebleed
every day for the past two weeks so I
have to take my air and literally put it
in my nose with a q-tip it's gross let's
cut that then I get into bed and I just
put my phone in and check any Twitter or
Instagram notifications that I have
check my emails and set my alarm for the
next day I put on my working hands hand
cream that does miracles for my freaking
hands because they're always so dry and
awful and I pick up my book that I'm
reading and I'm reading honest bye to
Lisa right now and I love it I love her
it's just nice to calm myself down after
a long day and you know just read and
get tired from reading so that's what I
do then I brought my candle and travel
light I'm so sad the month of Madison's
over ever think you so much for being
there with me and supporting me through
it all I love you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
