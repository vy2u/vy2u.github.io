song but you can think of that was like
a big ass jam I have on here and there
like wiki list it is a good song oh yeah
turn up turn up turn up turn up odd turn
up heyo so today I'm in front of my
christmas tree but it's my November
favorites because November is over it is
December it's Christmas time uh yeah
christmas time Christmas Day and if you
couldn't tell I'm very excite for
Christmas I get super excited during the
holiday season and the holiday time of
year it's the greatest time of year and
I'm really excited to show you my
favorites for the month of november and
i realized when I was getting my stuff
together that I didn't do in October
favorites so this could be october /
november but I found these things during
november so we're just gonna go November
favorites and it's gonna be okay so this
might have member favorites sorry again
that I didn't have an October but let's
get started so my first favorite for the
month of November is our new foundation
that I found and I was using the chart
Amazonian clay foundation um since my
homecoming this is next i went to finish
it up and i want to use you know a lot
of it because it was forty dollars but
it was quite quite oranger than my skin
tone so i thought i try to find one that
would match my pale skin so I did find
Laura Mercier's silk creme foundation
that L Fowler or allThatGlitters 21 uses
I thought I'd try this out because she
does have light tone skin so I was like
okay I'll try I'm paler and I want to
find something that matches my skin now
I have to worry about my neck and my
face being two different colors so I
went to the laura mercier section and
sex with avenue and i found the
foundation that i was looking for I got
the lightest shade in soft ivory and I
liked it so far it was fifty dollars
which was even more than the Amazonian
clay foundation but i really like it
because it matches my skin and that was
my number one priority when i was
looking for a new foundation sure may
not give me that you know tannish color
that i love but then again it's like it
has its downfall sure it may make you
look you know tannish in pictures but in
real life you kind of look like snooki
so i went with a paler one and I'm
actually happy with you know showing my
natural skin in my natural skin color
not trying to hide it underneath tons
and tons and tons of cakey foundation
this foundation is really
aight silky like it says in the title
I've been really enjoying it because
it's nice and light for the wintertime
then I finally found a bronzer that gave
me enough color but didn't make me look
orange or cakey like my previous
foundations and bronzers it is the
Rimmel London natural bronzer and this
was three or four dollars i think at
target it's a waterproof bronzing powder
which i love because if your skin gets
oily or greasy throughout the day it
will not get like off or slide off or
start to crease or cake or get in the
lines of your skin I like to put on my
temples and I try to contour my
cheekbones but we all know that doesn't
really work on my face because otherwise
it's like it looks too brown on me since
my skin is so pale looks kind of jank I
just really like this color it's the
lightest one in the shade 020 sunshine I
think its latest one I don't know now
0-2 that's the last one I remember
getting the last one that I was with my
mom and I was like okay I need to start
you know finding things that match my
skin the wintertime because I can't be
super super tan yeah so what I have some
color and then to complete my whole like
new face routine I got a new concealer
which is the Maybelline fit me concealer
in the shade 10 light and it's a little
messy I don't know why I've had it for
about two weeks and it is little dark
but it's the lightest shade that they
had at least I think it's the lightest
shade I like to put under my eyes and on
my nose because makeup seems to always
run off my nose I don't go with the
problem I so will not stand my nose so
now I put a little extra you know layer
on my nose so it stays you know covered
secure and it doesn't show my my redness
I'm literally like Rudolph the red-nosed
reindeer like it's Christmas time I know
but I'm Rudolph on my nose and my cheeks
Madison the red-nosed reindeer girl
Madison there in this Ranger girl next
continue on with my face I have benefits
gimme brow in the darkest shade which
yet medium deep I have super super dark
eyebrows we couldn't tell from my videos
and so this is the director Xu they have
so is a good three and one you have the
spoolie so dick at you eyebrows nice and
like shaped how you won them it fills
them in with the color and it's a
jealous what mattifies the eyebrows they
stay in place they stay down and it's
just like a clear transparent Maybelline
gel that I've been using for 10 years
but now i'm using this it's a three in
one I really love it you should
definitely check it out it's super tiny
but it will last a really long time oh
my god I'm hang an ornament like I keep
hitting an ornament and it's making a
really loud noise I don't know if you
here but it's annoying in my ear and my
last beauty product for the month of
November is the brand simples eye makeup
remover I went through like four bottles
of neutrogena sigh makeup remover um
which I love and it says its oil free
and all but I just felt really greasy
after i was using it like on my eyes and
this is really amazing to me because it
doesn't sting my eyes oh i can literally
like pour this in my eyes and win sting
I'm not obviously that would be weird
but that's what I'm saying like if you
do get a little in your eyes or if
you're like using a cotton pad or a
q-tip and maybe a little drop gets in
your eyes it's not going to hurt or
sting or irritate them which is amazing
and I have contacts so everything works
out in the end this is really nice and
it gets off even waterproof makeup which
I do wear sometimes and this is just I
don't know I just in love with this
because it doesn't hurt and I've never
been a huge fan of simple brand I like
it but it's not like my favorite you
know new Eugenia was usually my favorite
and I really like this so I'm a stick
with this from now on it's about 10
bucks I got it from my local grocery
store though um cuz that's where I was
when I picked it up you could give it a
target you know Walmart Walgreens
wherever they sell this and yeah I
really like it moving on I have a
favorite candle of the month in its Beth
my works is white barn brand it's the
mahogany antique wood i love this candle
so much it smells like abercrombie and
hollister I never really breakfast
candle before this year for some reason
I think I had it but I don't know anyway
I started burning it I've gone through
about a third of it a half of it no
third of it yeah and I am in love with
this candle I know sometimes ever common
Hollister sent can be really strong but
this like isn't it mixed room smell like
that and smell good but it doesn't make
it smell bad or overwhelming or strong
if you know what I mean this just smells
so good i would recommend this to anyone
i got it when the cable to a tree for
twenty dollars a bath and body works and
i got this one and leaves which my
leaves is all gone i think but I'm
obsessed with burning candles this year
I've had candles before but I haven't
like heard them as much as I do this
year and this is definitely my favorite
scent of all time it smells like heaven
in a jar next for food favorites I have
a healthy favorite for once for food
which is surprising because usually I'm
like dr. pepper and candy this time
around this month are the ocean spray
craisins or dried cranberries mass on
the packaging and I love making outside
super super cute um but that's not why I
got him but anyway these are really good
in there really healthy instead of
sitting down eating chips your crackers
try some healthy you know foods like
this it can be a fruit vegetable
something like that you know yogurt but
crisis because they're actually really
sweet and really healthy and you feel
like you're in eating candy but it's
crazy anyway I really really enjoy these
and it just makes you feel good about
yourself and like the rest of your day
is just like happy because you ate
something good and healthy and just good
for you and your body so yeah that's why
i recommend this and moving on to my
favorite music of the month so i'm crazy
happen to me to swell month well not
really crazy but I became obsessed and
I'm not just saying I like just kind of
music no I became obsessed with 80s
music and I've always loved a few hits
