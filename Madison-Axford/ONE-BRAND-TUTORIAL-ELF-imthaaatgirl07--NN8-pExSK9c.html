dramatic smoky eye with all of the
products my entire face and eye on
everything lashes to lips is by Elif
eyes lips face the brand that you can
get at Target and Walmart online so I
love this because it's all adult $1 to
$5 products you know like one to six
actually and I achieved this so you can
too and definitely you don't need to
spend the most money to get a
beautiful-looking so get this which is
perfect for home come here prom or
whatever for literally like under $20 so
if you want to see how I got this
beautiful look keep on watching okay so
my hair is in a bun because you see my
face when I do my makeup but yes so
we're starting with this entirely elf
makeup tutorial and I'm very excited to
do this because I feel like I gay I
judged up too quickly before I started
using it and I started using it and
realized I really really liked it so I'm
here to do a tutorial stay with all
these health products that I have that
I've used before in love sex the
foundation I chose from elf is elfs BB
cream actually and it has SPF 20 which
is amazing and it's in the shade buff
this one looks like it's a little like
pump tube thing and I am using my Beauty
Blender just because it's the only thing
I found that successfully applies my
foundation the way I like it
from any company like its I just used
the B blender for any product any
company any time foundation goes on a
Beauty Blender for me and I'm just going
to apply this to areas that are needed
which is my whole face
um so the thing about this is yeah it's
a little too dark but for some reason
this was the only shade that my target
had on sale and I was like wow I'm gonna
pay
I'm not gonna be $6 I'm gonna get it for
three so they had this straight on sale
so I was like yup saving money and we're
just gonna make it work and make it
blend because I wasn't gonna spend more
money than I needed to and I mean come
on I'm known for not having the right
shades so let's just add another video
with it name correct foundation shade to
my channel but in the end it doesn't
really matter so I'm just buffing this
in to my skin and it covers amazingly oh
yeah Peter couldn't tell this is like a
chit chat video this just covers
incredibly for BB cream like oh my god
every freckle redness zit scar and
discoloration pepper fermentation dark
circle is gone with this with before um
even though that even a concealer so so
I've got in my mouth I hope you can't
see that but like I really wouldn't
shoot them huh
whoops there's gonna drive down my neck
a little bit and back by my ears because
it is kind of different color make sure
your eyebrows are covered um I would
always bring it like the smaller my
Resta make sure that's covered and yes I
think I'm good to go with it the
foundation so this isn't my favorite
thing ever from ELF but it sells HD
lifting concealer it's like this little
tube one I think it's a new products
because I've never seen it before
um but yeah so just comes out like this
oh and I forgot to say I'm in the shade
light which is actually a little too
dark like I wanted this to be more of a
highlighter concealer but it's a little
too dark so but we make it work
that's why I put a little on my channel
and unibrow area so then I'm taking the
other side of my Beauty Blender and just
blending all of this ouch under my eyes
and the other places I already said a
little up to my eyelid cassettes good
I'm gonna use for the primer because I'm
sorry I love elf but I cannot see on
that eye shadow primer it's like the
cheap um sigh of elf is that I should
have primers like 2 bucks and just does
not hold the shadows so instead of
wasting money on that again because I've
had it before and I hated it I just
decided to use excess concealer as
and eyeshadow primer blending that all
out
and I think I am done concealing then
for my shows and taking this elf baked
eyeshadow trio in Brown bonanza I love
this I love their baked eyeshadows
they're just incredibly beautiful and
great dupes for high-end I thought it
was like Stila or Urban Decay into this
first pale white creamish color um
that's just absolutely perfect for a
base color for and any eyeshadow look
really and I'm just packing this on on
my inner corner and out a little bit to
my middle wood um since it is elf the
pigmentation is a little wonky so you
might have to pile quite a bit on so
that's why it's taken me up quite a
while to get this on and I found that
these baked eyeshadows for milk come off
on your finger a lot more than on a
brush so it's not sticking like how you
want it just dip your finger in that and
press it on I'm using this second color
which is like a brown color and I'm
doing my finger on this just because I
don't have a brush that I like to put
like right here and like it just comes
off of my finger better like I already
said this is just kind of kinda gonna be
like the transition color for the smokey
eye instead of just putting a dark color
on top of the ivory like base color I'm
just using this in the middle to kind of
blend them all together evenly you don't
need that much of this just like the
finger with and yeah again if the messy
doesn't matter we'll blend that in in
the end my dark last color in this
palette on the outer corner of my eye
again it's gonna look messy but that's
why we blend it in with a transition
color in the end
and I carry mine a little up here more
like towards my eyebrow a little higher
than all the other shadows just to make
sure it blends correctly because you
don't do that it might not look like a
great smokey eye so that I'm just taking
this Mac brush which is my vera brush
ever to blend this all together
so then once all the eyeshadow is done
I'm going to go in with this elf
sunkissed glow bronzer I'm moving on to
powders now and I'm not going to set my
face because this be pre-madonna think
you need to set it per say it's not like
a foundation but rather I am going to
just use a lot of powders like blush and
bronzer so I'm using my Real Techniques
brush because I don't like any elf
brushes for bronzer and I'm just dipping
into this and going into the light
contour gel blush and the elf bronzers
are very very light and not very
pigmented so like you might need a lot
to make any build up of a contour occur
I'm just going to go into my temples a
little bit blend down to the corner ear
and back to where are you originally
contoured this is very orangie undertone
so you can see that so it's good it's
not like a heavy Brown huh bronzer then
I'm going to go in with this elf blush
palette and I'm absolutely in love with
this color right here I think it's very
very light and beautiful with my it
cosmetics blush brush I'm just gonna
brush this on very lightly because not
too much because you don't overpower the
very light bronzer that we just applied
get that I'm gonna go into the elfs
clear eye brow gel and just give these
babies some shape and glue them down so
don't go crazy throughout the day this
is a must otherwise my eyebrows look
like crap
and move them around to get the shape
you want and then glue them down then
I'm going to go in with elfs expert
liquid liner in jet black and I want to
line up my top lid very lightly
this is just to give like the false
lashes a little something to grab onto
and I'll fix it at once and I put my
fingers on
look I'd ride don't open your eyes
otherwise we'll be a hot mess and then
I'm taking my natural L flashes I feel
like I can't hold my eyes and I don't
use the glue that's in here I mean I'm
sorry it just sucks so I use my duo lash
glue and then you just take these off
these are the most the only $1 and like
there's some of the most natural lashes
I could find
does anyone overdo it with this look and
I've been known to overdo it with lash
up in the past so no we're trying these
so you're just gonna kind of bend them
after you taking on the package to get
that natural curve shape and they'll
bite your lip easier rather than for six
straight so doing that well my eye liner
is drying I'm just gonna take it this
elf moisturizing lipstick and apply it
to my lips I don't know the color for X
it's scratched off the Mambo try to find
what color this is for you but I have it
on now still drying I'm gonna go in with
these lashes wait till this gets tacky
before you apply otherwise won't stick
let me zoom in you in for this part here
we go you don't need lashes obviously
but I just like to do it because I want
to add like a little extra to this eye
look because it is kind of a more
dramatic brown gray smokey eye and I
just want to add a little pop of lashes
my lashes are very very short so while
this dries I'm going to apply just a
thin coat of ELPS luminizing defining
mascara
this is also just going to give the
lashes something to grab on to and
they'll help the regular lashes blend in
with the new false lashes
and you can see how much easier they
blend with that like first eyeliner line
and I put on and then I'll just after
this dries put another little coat of
eyeliner on top to make it all blend in
okay so right now both artists are on
they're still drying so I'm just gonna
go in with once again my luminizing in
defining mascara from ELF and just go on
my bottom lashes real quick so I'm
titling my eyeliner dry again because I
fixed my eyeliner after I applied my
lashes but the last step is to just take
this pointer where again that I use for
my crease color and this dark color and
just smear out the eyeliner that I have
in my waterline on my bottom lower
lashes just kind of smear this dark
color with it
