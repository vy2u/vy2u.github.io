Q&amp;amp;A 11 people doing these I was like
I'll try it out and I got a lot of
snapchat I think for me so I'm gonna try
to answer as many as I can I'm gonna do
videos if you sent me a video that's
what I'm going to do because it's more
interesting to watch other people send
videos rather than just pictures or text
that's not really what this is so if you
sent me a video it will be featured in
this but anyway let's get started the
first is from Alexis Stein 5 I hope this
shows up what does a real name and do
you like it ok my middle name is Taylor
Madison Taylor and um I like it I would
kind of shows my first name unless cuz
everyone I feel like has the name
Madison so that's like oh I wish my name
wasn't Madison sometimes but it is so I
got I own it I gotta work it but you
know what I mean like it seems like
everyone's day name nowadays is medicine
but yeah I'm Taylor I wish was my first
name from Rooker B's my third college
class that I have had cuz like I don't
know if I'm gonna like one more on the
future but in the past was probably
either theatre psychology never fun for
me and I think they're very interesting
especially psychology but Peter was mine
because I'm a theater nerd okay from
Tyler young
I love Kyla
I met Kyler when I was down in Florida
and I adore him so um I guess it depends
on the age I'm not saying that
teacher-student relationships are good
or you should do it because it is
illegal I think I don't know about in
college but in high school you know it's
illegal um yeah if it wasn't illegal I
would say just depends on age I mean it
just been a number but then again you
don't want to be like having a crush on
a 60 year old but once you graduate
Kyler that's a different story
from Carly ho2 oh girl I love the accent
um I love you too am I ever gonna I love
Louisiana I've only been to New Orleans
it's so typical tourists right but I
loved it was really fun I wanted a young
age to Bourbon Street scared me but

inflexibility oh no um my favorite
makeup brand is Oh is Mac so okay from
Cassidy one eight one three talking
videos I love sitting down and talking
you guys whether it's answer your
questions giving my opinion sigh making
products etc um I don't like expectation
versus reality videos I'm not on YouTube
to interrupt my saturation and count to
a thousand percent and actually given
I'm not trying to be singer I'm not
trying to be a beauty group I'm not
trying to be someone who does
expectations reality videos I'm here to
be myself and so my favorite video is
just to be myself and just to talk and
share my opinion it helps when you guys
like that and that's maybe why you
subscribed but yeah dream big one two
two three
yes I'm doing I feel like one right
after this I was in the videos not
because I could hate and don't leave me
hate so I can do another video so if I
go on to leave hate you hope to get in
my this video is getting a shoutout but
I did this videos because I want to show
you that no matter what kind of mean
awful comments I get I can stick through
it I can push through it and not let it
bother me just like you shouldn't let
anything
happens to you bother you from naya love
dance and let me - oh why did I started
because I wanted more friends what
expired me because I loved makeup so
what inspired me was because I love
makeup and I need you create a channel
it was something that I actually was
passionate about doing otherwise there's
no point and why I actually pushed
myself to do it was because I wanted
more friends I wanted to inspire people
and I wanted to meet people and I didn't
I was like stuck with just like a few
friends in high school who I absolutely
adore but I felt like I didn't have
enough friends I feel like I wasn't
making a difference so I was like I'm
gonna try to do videos - Gracie and gd6
I didn't remember
okay favorite movie is neither sex in
the city or move on for Disney movies
favorite song sissy that walk favorite
Hall if I can't eat one food it'd be

other ones okay from miss Quade one two
three my god you're so cute I ran to the
zoast it is Taylor so from Donovan one

year rather than a dorm but yes I
touched my roommate since I don't know
her before this and asked her if it's
like a cage of film but you guys I'm
hoping to do that and yes I am keeping
in touch with Jeff we can email each
other once a week but I would never you
know stop keeping in touch with Jeff
