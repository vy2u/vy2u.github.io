polish collection i have um eight
polishes so yeah not that many i'm not a
big nail polish girl as you can see i
haven't paid my ears my ears my nails
and like 10 years they're pretty
atrocious and I don't um take actual
time out of my day just to paint these
ugly things so um these are pretty much
the only nail polishes I really have it
may I have a few China glasses and
essays but really it's just OPI is
because i really love OPI nail polishes
they say on forever so if I'm gonna buy
a nail polish it will be OPI but again I
don't pay my nails that often so don't
know what that Rin rant was about back
to the OPI nail polish collection let's
get started ok the first OPI nail
posture have is from the Pirates of the
Caribbean on collection and it's called
stranger tides
anyway this is what looks like it's kind
of like a really grotesque green but I
just like really liked it for some
reason I was like I'm gonna buy that out
of all the colors in the collection I
picked this one don't know why I bet I
mean I guess I can see where I liked it
it's very like all of drab almost it's
just a really pretty nice fall color the
next color is French Quarter for your
thoughts and it's it looks green but
it's a gray color it's just nice grade
to put on your nails for like fall again
yeah i just really like this color it's
really nice and you can wear tiny formal
or anything like that the next co i have
is another dark full color it looks
black but it is definitely not it's a
dark plum purple I had this mir how I
heartfelt AG because again it's like a
fall color um I really like this color
you can definitely tell that it's not
black when it's on your nails like you
can see a purple tint to it and it's
just a beautiful color this is
definitely one of my favorites and it's
called siberian nights next colors from
there on muppets collection it's called
gone gonzo and down it's just a blue
sparkly color and usually like it said
in another video I think with sparkly
colors you have to put like a shade
underneath it and then like a sparkling
on top because sparkly is certainly have
enough color in it to like be just a
nail polish by itself it's you should
just like a top color but this
definitely can because it's full of like
blue nail polish and then blue and
silver sparkles and it's just an
absolutely gorgeous color looks like a
disco ball then we have another sparkly
one and this one's called in a
flirtationship and it's a red sparkly
one kind of like love Maryland by China
Glaze and this again can be worn alone
just very pretty color I think away this
for christmas i wore um love Marilyn by
China Glaze for Christmas last year and
she really liked red sparkly nail
puzzles are just beautiful look like
ruby slippers or something freshman is
just nice baby pink color just really
simple very pretty um it's a little
sheer so you have to put quite a few
quotes up quotes quite a few quotes on
quite a few coats on and it's called
painting of you then I have just a red
color ever gonna need a plain red color
and my mom said this look
actly like the color she wore in her
wedding which makes it even more special
I thought you have a lisp that was weird
and it's called do you think I'm texy I
think it was from a collection oh I
don't know what collection this is from
is there like a Texas collection or
states or sign I don't know Andy last
color it's kind of short video but a
hotter pink really these are just simple
colors not much just for ipad them I
mean obviously you can see the pinger
red they're just really pretty colors on
your nails and I knew that I had to pick
them up and this is called shorts story
Oh God yeah that was my um OPI nail
polish collection I'm not a big nail
polish person I'm very particular of my
nail polishes because i only like to do
12 coats max because i don't have all
the time in the world to be painting my
nails the egg was kind of annoying said
you like 10 quotes too oh my god 10
coats to actually get like a color but
that's okay it's OPI you notice that
last song you know it's gonna be worth
your while you know it's not gonna chip
again i hope you liked this video please
