vlogging that I'm gonna try to do I'm
wanting the same jacket as yesterday if
you're gonna judge leave I guess it'll
cook out for the day I just have this
forever 21 black tank on with my hmm
green jacket and then I have two new
jeans are from they like ripped all the
way down from Charlotte Russe and then I
have these like Nine West little heels
on I usually don't wear heels like this
um my mom gave them to me and I was like
okay I can deal they're cute thank you
mom so yeah so today my sister and mom
play tennis so we're going to the club
my car's still in the shop otherwise I
wouldn't necessarily be going per se I
would probably be doing something else
like running errands but I did all my
errands for the most part yesterday my
bed still not may I yeah I still to wash
the sheets today um but so I'm going to
think Tennis Club with them I don't play
tennis so I got a book in the mail today
my mom ordered a book it's Holly
Madison's down the rabbit hole it just
came out I'm so excited for this am I
the only one that's so excited
curious adventures and cautionary tales
of a former Playboy bunny okay so it's
gonna be a little a little raunchy
raunchy but you know I'm excited to read
it because I'm excited to hear what she
has to say and yeah I'm it's a big book
so we'll see if I actually read it or
get done with it but I thought it would
be a perfect time now when they're at
the club for me to do this and like a
read do something I don't have any
summer school homework to do so yeah but
I just got out of the shower I did
makeup again the same makeup as
yesterday I self chant which I do every
other day so I don't get really blotchy
I exfoliated in the shower which really
helps I'm noticing with my self-tanner
and yes so I will keep you up to date
when I get my car back and stuff like
that they didn't fix it it's gonna be
like eight hundred dollars to fix it so
we have to like think what we want to do
about it cuz it started working again
before they fixed it so whatever we'll
see what's happening it's working and
that's all we need to know right now but
yeah I'll keep you up-to-date see you
later hey guys were at the club now so
I'm just in this locker room I thought I
would like tour you around because I'm
bored and nothing else to do
yeah hey I'm just waiting for something
to walk in and make this awkward um okay

weigh cuz I can tell you one thing and
not 81 pounds anymore okay see what

113 pounds and I own every pound of it
I'm proud that I'm finally a healthy
weight like it's taken me so long to get
there and I never had the eating
disorder I just could not gain weight
and so I would be 81 pounds
I was 81 pounds like my senior year and
then I grew and grew and grew and I'm
normal no I mean now that he's not
normal you know you work beautiful every
way we are but you know it's kind of

hi guys so I just left the Tennis Club
with my mom my sister Leland we went to
the shop to pick up my car it's not okay
it's fixed but it's not fixed like they
didn't do anything fix it just like
brought itself back to life and so it's
actually fixed it still kind of like a
like I wouldn't take it on long trips
you know like kind of like the sketchy
like we don't know what's happening with
it it's fixed for now and it works fine
but we don't know what the future holds
for the car I just watch Walgreens

so that's done
booyah oh my god
I took forever I have a headache yeah
because I haven't eaten anything since
breakfast or drink anything I'm like
dehydrated I need caffeine I've had egg
holy crap I need to go home now
it's 90 no it's
yeah 90 degrees I'm wearing jeans and
jacket again but I love this I throw on
this necklace before I left too I didn't
mention that but yeah so anyway I'm
going home now and I will see you when I
get there I think I'm gonna organize my
closet today that sounds fun share a
coke with this this Oh
share it with
Jericho with us in Jericho quit this is
love you I am back to my room because
I'm not finished cleaning it per say I
want to do more because I want it to be
very nice and clean and just like like
it's okay right now it's pretty good I
mean I think you're sure just like death
gets clean this crap I need to go to
Goodwill and stuff I was eating goldfish
sorry and coke and my closets all clean
but I don't like how it looks like this
kind of just looks like I shoved
everything I owned here and I don't have
that many colorful things but I would
like it to be color coordinated like I
would like it to be like you know from
whites grey all the way down to like
pink purple yellow black you know
whatever um yeah I kind of want to be
organized and then on this side I have a
million puffer dress like this is fine
this is like the few skirt so I hang out
hang up overalls scarves like this is
how I really care about dresses I think
I just want to organize the main part
from like colors and then like shorts
leave our tank tops motivated through
horror inch sleeve and long sleeve and
then jackets and stuff I don't know that
might be our project for the day is
we're at right now so if I freezing
again gosh um if I finished anything I
will tell you I will let you guys know
up you update you throughout this day
right now it's about 5:15 so yeah we'll
see what happens okay guys I finished my
closet and I realized when I edit it the
up to it now the video you've seen it
all so I realized there's like a little
foggy like dot on my lens so I'm sorry
about that I think it cleared it off but
you know we're working with what we got
I'm sorry about to add this really
annoying I know anyway I think I
finished my closet for the most part
it's like doesn't want any Tsar in order
but here's the color-coding kind of all
right so it starts with like creams
melted white gray black then it's like
Pink's blues
pinks reds blues uh like greens and then
yellow and then like Leopard
so I'm really happy with how it turned
out there's some like odd ones you know
in here but overall you get the gist
that it goes from colors to color so let
us understand that's exciting
oops I can close this finally and I'm
down my closet so I love what comp
listening something you today that I
don't know that if I hadn't been
vlogging I don't know if I would have
done that so I'm glad that like I'm
voting because it gives me encouragement
to do things so I can share with you
them and give you encourage me to clean
your room to know um so yeah I'm really
also okay hold up I need to give a
shout-out to CELTA I can't even say the
names they'll die it sounds like Russian
if the Channing stuff that I've been
using and you can tell there's not
orange at all it's just a nice light
brown tan color that gets a tan it's not
an orange and I love banana boat I've
been a fool you know banana boat
supporter it's like five dollars but um
you go from pale to orange whereas this
one I've been loving I've used it twice
no splotchiness let me show you
definitely check them out I'll have them
linked in the downbar but I've been
using this body scrub exfoliator like I
said from salsa it smells like coffee so
kind of wakes you up if you're showering
the morning and then I am I'm
entertaining routine video if you want
to see that comment below if you want to
see that then I'm using this old urban
decay like stipple brush to blend in on
my wrists and my feet because it can be
a little rash rash if you don't do some
and then I'm using the smell skin
perfecting self-tanner I don't know how
this works so well but and doesn't smell
like radio channel ocean no dinging
lotion smells good but this kind of
smells like not regulating lotion I
definitely check them out oh my it works
so well unlike any and I've tried a lot
of tanning lotions hey loss and I'm not
putting on every day that might help -
I'm putting on every other day um and
yeah I'm just been loving that so so
yeah I have my windows open but it's a
pretty cloudy day yet again in Missouri
oh I want to light a candle that's what
I do thinks I'm so using up my candles
but for fall season can't move it's
almost like fall it's almost it's
basically July which basically means
that it's August it basically means that
it's school starting again which
basically means fall and winter and
Christmas yay it's like this this
picture always cracks me up like oh my
god oh oh God fire fire hazard do you
see that that pictures fell on that okay

Cedella Marley based on the Summum bonum
it's so cute like I bought this book as
