so today's try on haul is all from
fashion Nova it's an online website I
love the clothing on there it's just so
so cute it's like unlike anything else
online so I'm just lucky yeah when I was
picking out things so yes without
further ado let's hop right into this
long awaited Tryon home so the first
thing I got is my absolute favorite
thing ever of life and there are these
distressed jogger jeans I guess you
would say of their jeans but it's a
jogger because it is an elastic
waistband so if you're pregnant girls
get this now I'm not pregnant that
sounded really bad that look was like I
was saying I was pregnant like
announcing it no I'm not pregnant
but if you are pregnant or if you eat a
lot these aren't for you they're
stressed it which means that they are
like this acid wash kind of thing it
goes from dark blue and light blue in
their ripped as well so they've been on
the block a few times I have one these
literally seven times since I've had
them and I've had it for about two weeks
so when them a lot of times they're so
comfy then you're not they feel like
jeans material but they don't feel like
jeans up here they cuff at the bottom
with some more elastic and you can roll
em up or leave them I don't roll them
these up personally and then you can tie
it but this tie doesn't make that much
difference of tightness level so it's
just kind of there for looks and I wear
these peels hugs anything flats they're
soaked you can dress them up any way you
want casual or fancy and they're so
comfy and I am just in love these I wear
these no joke every possible chance I
can and get I wear these the second
thing of that is actually I am wearing
it it's not this let me take this off it
looks a little scandalous but it's not I
promise
well it kind of is but this is white
onesie and it's I think it could be used
as a bathing suit I'm not sure but it's
a onesie and so this is the top it's
very it looks scandalous with all the
cutouts but if you think about at my
cleavage and everything is covered so I
don't think that it's that scandalous so
you probably wear this to a club or if
you do YouTube when you're filming a
video me but I like this I just picked
it up so it looks crazy and fun and I
was just like why not like let me let me
just get this one crazy thing and the
rest will be fine actually I got another
crazy thing by the time
I don't know I just really like this
because I think it's unique I've never
seen anything like it and I'm like yeah
whatever it kind looks like a skeleton
or something I got this blue sparkly top
I've heard it more like all this stuff
you pryzen it in instagrams it's like a
navy sparkly sequined top it's a crop so
you will see your bellybutton
but I do wear it with those jogger pans
often which does cover up my belly
button there's come up very high you
could choose how high you want to bring
them up but anyway it worked this is
what my stomach's not like hanging out a
midriff all the time and it zips all the
way down and is an entire back zip which
can be nice if you want to put it on the
back but I usually just unzip it a
little bit put it on over my head and
then I'm good to go
it's very Hugh and I got a bigger size
cuz I didn't want such a crop feel to it
I'm not a huge fan of crop tops anymore
I used to be but I just love this there
was a peach one I think and in this I
like maybe because it's just so much
darker and I like dark colors and I
don't know it just went with my skin
tone and hair better so I love this
shirt it's one that I've learnt a lot as
well then I got this which is a little
crazy I don't know exactly why I picked
this out and this was one size fits all
I'm pretty sure I always used to say the
word posh oars like all the time I'm
gonna be like much more like that was
what I said I didn't say like hello like
all my friends know that - gosh Jarvis
my thing
and so I originally picked this out
because of that but now I'm like what I
actually went some pub leg I don't know
maybe it's me so it's like a blue and
green sequin top that says blush or
literally I love posh hard because
that's where my favorite boards and yeah
it's just like it was crazy crazy
metallic sequined shirt dress so it is a
t-shirt dress it is a bit long for a
t-shirt dress up yeah I don't really
know what I'm doing though just yet but
I bought but I got it the last thing I
got are a pair of leggings and I don't
also know what I'll wear these very much
but I think this one yes one size fits
all again um I mean I dunno what I wear
these but if they're kind of crazy I
always wanted ripped leggings and I
always have like nice ones that don't
have any holes in them some when I saw
this I was like I just got to get it so
I'll shut up and not wonder whether or
not they'll look out of me so I do like
them it's just kind of hard to find or
make these look fancy because you can't
really tell you ever you'll tell when I
try them on that they're ripped all the
way down and I love that look
but it's a little hard to work with
sometimes I'm like how do i what topped
over this to make it still look you know
fancy and not too crazy but I don't know
in the end in the end I do I do like
them not my favorites but yeah so that
is my passion over try on haul I really
do like fashion Nova so definitely check
