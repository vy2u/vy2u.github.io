guys so today to start out I love this
look okay I've done it so many times um
and I don't know it's just like one my
favorites to do so I just want to save
herself that I'm very excited to finally
be doing this look for you it was highly
requested and all my pictures and stuff
that I posted with you can just look on
so I'm very excited to do for you today
anyway starting out is what I always use
it's my skin to Navia makeup primer
spray i also have a setting spray i'll
use the end but this is the green tinted
one I love this just to add a little
moisture to my face before I apply
anything whether that's tape for my
eyeshadow my foundation whatever it may
be I want to just apply a little bit of
this first with few squirts a few inches
away from your face just to get hydrated
and ready for the application of all the
makeup I said a few but we know if he
means 20 we start with eyes got some
ratchet tape that I just thought you
know like to use to sharpen up the edges
a little bit make sure everything is
nice and tidy because nothing is worse
than a messy as smokey eye if you know
what I mean some just gonna it takes a
little bit to get exactly where I want
it even on both sides but you know you
can always use a makeup wipe when you're
done with your eyeshadow and clean
anything up if it is a little uneven or
you know if your angles are different
and jarred anyway um yes so I'm just
doing some tape because I like to like I
said clean the edges and make sure my
eyeshadow is on point increased
correctly um and yes first I'm going to
be using a few shadows from my beloved
makeup geek palette is my zeepad I
created all makeup geek shadows there's
no Mac there's no abh there's nothing in
here besides makeup geek I like to keep
my shadows with the brand's together
rather than all jumbled up together so I
remember what is what I'm going to be
taking my favorite one obviously is my
royal and langnickel definitely check
out these brushes if you have not I've
like all the sets i love them royal and
langnickel Master Pro Set tapered
blender the mp150 brush it's a really
really fat brush to go in with this nice
favorite color my entire pal
it all the mega p shows creme brulee
right here is the perfect base shade for
really any any I look oh my god I didn't
even put primer on and you guys
forgetting something I was like why do I
feel like I'm ready starting my show so
quick anyway I always use Mac painterly
Paint Pot I don't like any other kind of
primers for eyes because I just feel
like they're very oily wet and slick and
they move my shadows wouldn't keep them
glued down so as you can see I've really
hit a pan on this and I'm just taking a
luck c 211 concealer brush not for
concealer but for my eyeshadow base
which is like I said Mac painterly Paint
Pot panel is just a good color for my
skin tone because it does have pinky
undertones and its really knew based um
so I'm just gonna dab this all over and
then take my middle ring finger and dab
it on in the heat from my finger well
therefore blend it in much better than
with this brush but I just like to use
this to get out of the container cuz I
don't mind dirty finger in the container
and also I don't want it under my nails
nails what nails Madison no you know
what I mean especially if you have
acrylics you don't want product under
your nails that's just gross so blend it
all the way out to the tape and in this
little corner this is what I call the
bitch of the face I hate this little
part where the eye and nose meet I never
seem to get foundation their product
there everything's was wretched mess
there so yeah going back to my beloved
palette like I said creme brulee on this
table brush knocking off any fallout and
then going in and carving out my defined
crease we all have different sized
creases find where your eye socket ends
and then just go in there's going to be
a little purple on this brush because I
didn't clean it but since we are doing
the couple look and I just did the
purple look I'm with this brush earlier
yesterday I think it was weird kind of
make it work because I didn't have time
to clean this brush and I know is doing
the same look so if the colors blended
it's whatever but usually there's no
purple tone a hidden creme brulee um I
don't know I just love that color so
like new and kind of with the orange and
yellow undertone I adore it so just
going all the way in windshield wiper
motions always the corner of my eye to
where the tape ends and then circling it
out to blend
don't worry if this looks messy it
really doesn't matter because shadows
will be placed on top what I think I'm
going to do today is a purple halo which
a halo is where you have matte colors on
both sides and then a sparkle glitter
pigment on the inter inter in our part
of the lid so there we go that shadow is
done we'll come back to this beautiful
starve the show in one second but i'm
going to my jaclyn hill morphe brushes
palette this is a great overall palette
took me a while to get used to some of
these colors because they're very like
right but I'm going to use this
beautiful purple light here but i love
about morphy shadows and makeup geek is
they're both so blendable if you put a
lot on it's okay it doesn't matter
really if you mess up because you could
always blend it out and I don't know it
works great um the problems Urban Decay
not hang on I'm decay at all but I often
choose not to use them because they're
extremely hard to plan and once you get
it on you better want to keep it there
because it doesn't really move easily it
doesn't blend as smoothly as some of
these really really karma we shade do I
like to comb Carly because it like
smoothie good yeah okay anyway I'm
taking my one-way fare brushes my makeup
geek planted crease brush and like i
said this purple color and just kind of
dabbing in knocking off the fallout and
then going in over top that creme brulee
color and defining at my crease and also
putting it in here in the inner corners
of my eye because we are doing that halo
illusion
try not to go above the crease otherwise
it starts to look like a black eye or a
bruise I've done that which many times
so try to stay right even with the
crease or a little below where that
creme brulee might have gone because
that's a skin color and you can get away
with that but you don't want a purple
blue or black inching up above the
crease and then just going in the inner
corner again it's going to look messy
we're gonna fix that it's fine if you
get any under your I don't worry um the
reason we do eyes first or there's an
idealized first before foundation so I
can take a makeup wipe wipe any fallout
or stuff that got a little messy during
the I process before I put foundation on
make sure you pack it on on both the
outer corner and the inner corner
because sometimes the really really
beautiful bright glittery color will
overpower them so we just want to make
sure that these are being seen as well
and then once you have enough product on
the inner and outer kind of connect them
real quick right here in the center
don't worry again if it's not straight
if it's a little messy because that
glitter shadow will be packed over top
of it the most part then I let's take it
down here and kind of a v-shape like
drawing it down to the my outer crease
as you can see right there I'm doing
okay I'm just going to take this brush
again just run a nickel saber blender
and just blending it out with any excess
creme brulee that is left on the brush
just to make sure there's no harsh like
little areas of too much product again
be careful to not go above the crease
try your best if you do it's fine but
just try really hard to keep it all down
and not going up towards your eyebrow
let's get most that done we're going
back to my Z palette using in this
beautiful beautiful purple shade from
makeup geek called daydreamer I love it
so much I'm taking a run tonight Nicole
Master Pro large shader BMP 148 brush
and I sprayed mac fix+ after I get the
product on my brush I used to spray then
get my shadow and then Pat it on but I
found that didn't make the color as
vibrant as it could be so I get all the
purple eyeshadow or whatever eyeshadow
color I'm doing then these pics + to
spray it and then it just makes it stick
and shine like amazingly so hey I'm
going to take a lot of this don't be
scared cuz I mean this is the star of
the show we don't want a little women a
lot going on you know tap off with this
any obvious excess and then go ahead and
spray a little with mac fix+ you have
eye drops they work the same as this and
then just going to pack it on just the
center of my lid
going up but not above the crease
in keeping it for the most part just in
the center will give it that halo effect
that we are trying to get packing out a
little more over top that and if it goes
too far out of just the center don't
worry we can take that on other point of
ours that we use and go over it again
with that deep plum color from the
morphe palette because i think i went a
little too overboard i got sooo excited
with this glitter but we can fix that in
a second
just going back with this more if you
color real quick to fix up any little
untidy pneus or where the glitter
overlapped I think the outer Quarrier is
pretty much fine for the most part but
this inner corner just got a little
hidden I am pretty much done with
eyeshadow unless I see any parts that
can be blended later in the process I'm
going to take a fun days tattoo liner in
trooper it's just the black shade it's a
beautiful beautiful product I just love
it because it's so easy to shake it to
get the product to go down to the
bristle tip brush and it lets you apply
it at such a thin eyeliner line it's
nothing nothing like it I pull up the
tape just because sometimes it says two
boats your eyelid pulls down your lashes
makes your eye water and when you're
putting eyeliner on you don't want water
or any liquid to get onto the other
it'll smear smudge and ruin the entire I
love therefore I'm taking the tape off
and like look at that definition look
how perfect hmm okay so excited okay I
mean taking the kat von d liquid
eyeliner it is easy to get thin line but
you don't want over to with the island
because the eyeshadow is so powerful you
don't want to draw a sick sick line of
eyeliner and I always I'm doing that
then cuz my hands are so shaky but I'm
really gonna try today to calm down into
a thin line
okay I think we're pretty good some
great little worried that I was going to
get too thick but God keep it as close
to lash line as possible
yes thank you we got thank you God
eyeliners my worst enemy I hate it with
passion but you gotta do it okay taking
L'Oreal telescopic mascara it's my
newfound favorite I'm drugstore mascara
by far I'm just applying a little coat
on my lashes before I apply falsies
making sure you get all the inner and
outer lashes because they will show if
you miss them when you put false lashes
on and then taking my urban decay we're
seven glide on eye pencil in perversion
which is black and just lining my tight
line which I'm going to wait for this I
scared to dry for a second I'm trying to
determine if I want to use I have hausa
lashes right Cemil don't have slushes in
here I'm trying to determine if I want
to use Bambi or if I want to lose iconic
as I kind of girl like in your face
obviously wearing lashes Bambi are light
and wispy I don't know which ones I want
to do for this look I think we do a
Bambi just because I don't want to draw
too much attention away from the
eyeshadow which is the main focus so any
man she thought I would determine us
with you
okay now i'm taking my house of lashes
eyelash adhesive which is in black it
looks green but i'm pretty sure black
tinted ice use do a white love it love
it love it you know it's a death do we
part but like it's white and it says it
dries clear and it does for the most
part but sometimes you can still see
white choppiness where your glue do not
blend in with your eyeliner so just do
it make sure it doesn't happen anymore
i'm using the black blue from has lashes
you don't have to wait for it to get a
key which is a plus that's why i really
adore this and bought it anyway i'm
going to use like I said my Bambi's
which are just nice little wispy lashes
they don't charge much attention away
from the halo eyeshadow applying the
thin coat if you take your lashes up at
the end of the night and you peel off
the glue that was previously on there
you can use these up to like 25 times if
you want to wipe them with like a little
alcohol wipe to get any bacteria
possible bacteria or germs off of them
do that girl like reuse these lashes
because lushes that are more expensive
than a dollar should be used more than
once and these are a lot more than a
dollar so make sure you are cleaning
them properly and taking care of them
and keeping them storing them in a safe
place away from bacteria and dirt and
then you can use them over and over
again not forever but a lot of times it
says you don't have to get this tacky
but I usually let it 5-10 seconds to get
some air and then I go right on and pop
it on the lash line
then I usually pull it just make sure
that this inner corner is pointed
downward and not lifting because I used
to not know how to apply fake lashes at
all and my inner corner would always be
like hi and i was just like bitch then
push up a little underneath the roots of
your natural lashes which will hit the
falsies and lift them a little bit make
sure the inner corner and outer corner
are pinned down if anything if the
middle comes up throughout the day or
the night or that when you're out and
about make sure your inner and outer
corridor down you should be good to
stick even if the middle glue pops off
you should still be good so just make
sure they are planted and where you want
them whether you want to more put it up
or down more dramatic or notch and then
you're good to go I kind of sweating why
is my house so hot
make sure they're the same height when
it up pointed down direction as the
other eye so you don't look like you
have a wonky eye and then you are done
with eyes like moving on the medicare
part which is the face i'm just going to
go in with a little more of the
scandinavian rate because i am now
applying actual product to my face and
i'm going in with a Beauty Blender that
i previously cleaned and my all time
favorite foundation I've been wearing it
for the last I don't know two months
it's Revlon Photoready insta-fix makeup
in the stick formula um it's really hard
to find this as well as my favorite
concealer which is a pan ya see because
I kind of refine what I want when I'm
out of it but I into the shade 130 shell
it's like better than to make up for
ever i have make forever HD foundation
stick not a huge fan honestly this is
just as good and it's maybe a fourth of
the price like let's be real Make Up For
Ever is like 49 after tax and this is
like 12 so just putting this all over
the face I don't go easy on this because
you only live once so put that stick on
your face oh that's added weird make
sure you get right next to your eye
shadow and make sure you hit all the
land achos of your neck ok going up to
be a winner just dabbing this when I
love so much about stick foundation is
this not drippy and droopy and really
liquidy and wet like a liquid can be and
usually is and it's not a powder you
know it's full coverage and it's like a
clay base I guess you could call it um
it's very waxy and it will not budge off
your face unless you are purposely
moving it with a brush or beauty blender
which I love like it stays in its spot
blending up by the hairline it just you
may need two layers depending on your
amount of discoloration or acne but i
don't know i just love this so much oh
my god it's like my knife tube of it i
go through it pretty fast and then blend
it down the neck
my concealer is the Gracie on earth it's
maybelline master conceal in 20 light i
choose a little lighter than my
foundation shade for my concealer
because i wanted to highlight under my
eyes the bridge of my nose my Cupid's
bow chin and forehead again this could
sail is hard to find the shades that we
sold out just like shell is in my stick
foundation but I oh my god I just adored
this real quick though what I want to do
is put a little i'm going to bake my
face i love being my face but this part
of my face right down here and up to
here always gets a little lost with the
bronzer so i'm just going to put a
little extra coverage right there just
make sure that they don't get lost in
translation later in the game when Ward
contouring taking my cancer which i just
got this new one today i'm going to put
that under my eyes in in stripes this
way listen it's easiest way to like
naturally highlight down my nose on my
nose and like a why thing on my forehead
keep its bow any acne around the nose
hormones and on my chin to highlight
this concealer it's the best thing ever
go get this right now oh my god if you
have to get one thing for this video get
that concealer
make sure you don't get any concealer on
your eyeshadow but right next to it
because you don't want to like miss a
patch of skin because you're still to
get too close but try not to get it on
the actual eye shadow job time to set
what I'm going to use is I'm getting
blow our mercy powders new but I'm just
use my holy grail covergirl right now
it's kind of similar in formula but the
laura mercier i think is a little more I
don't know heavy duty I'm taking my
favorite brush ever the kat von d
two-sided face shade and light brush and
the fluffy side i'm taking first and
just setting the under eye which is the
most important area of said if you can
only set one area cuz you're like short
on time under I girl cuz that creasing
mm-hmm it's not cute I'll lead to a
bigger mess with your eye makeup later
in the game so just said that make sure
it goes all the way up to where you
applied that concealer then I also apply
right here around my nose on quite
heavily because I get really greasy
there I've noticed that's my one spot
that I get very greasy we all have like
the one spot that's just like a hot-ass
mess in the day I'm gonna be around my
nose and my nose and I'm just going to
go over top any other place that I
applied concealer
I had like a weird brown line in the
middle of my forehead what was that okay
we blended that away now I'm going to go
in with the actual Kat Von D shade in
light palette I love this i bought these
two together because why not you know
like I just need to get both and I'm
taking this middle shade this one is too
like pale and gray for my skin this
one's wait wait way to brown toned so
this is just a nice kind orangi tone
tapping out excess and going in best I
can contouring is hard to carve out
Michiko
you always want to like blend up because
what happens to mine is it often follows
down here and it just looks kind of like
a beard so I'm trying to blend in an
upward motion to make sure we don't have
beard fallout I always have a very very
heavy armed when i'm contouring i'm also
going to take a little bit of this and
blend into my temples because i do have
a larger forehead i think um because i
have a tiny face but like a large
forehead so which kind of lens into the
hairline and the temples and then
eventually we will end it down and meet
with a contour an art cheekbone so
everything's there we go blend it one
color blend a little on our double chin
okay I'm going to take this brush
actually real quick which is from a run
tonight Nicole revolution the x 40 it's
like a pointed flat foundation brush ma
I'm just gonna take a little bit of this
and go under my bottom lip to create a
fuller lip just by shooting it under it
this makes your bottom lip look a lot
bigger and fuller when we really know
bitch we know you're seeking so I'm
going to go in then with strong
identical revolution VX 35 brush and use
my covergirl powder again to bake this
contour ok we're going to bake the face
part out the contour line
drag it down and above
I'm gonna let it sit for about five six
seven minutes and then we will come back
and finish the face going back in with a
shade in like hatton ND brush and
brushing away this covergirl powder so
then for lips I'm taking posy perfect
Mac lip pencil I think this is like
those special elite kind what is this
pro bowl and we're mebane I'm going to
line my lips is the perfect shade um
mash for mac angel lipstick which is my
go-to every day
and then taking back angel going over
top that that's just perfectly if any
lines like went too far under without
messing up your contoured lip just kind
of smudge away the crazy lip line i'm
taking NYX butter gloss in creme brulee
which is off my favorite makeup geek
shadow as I just told you I'm flying
this just on the bottom because it goes
far enough to cover the top lip as well
then I am taking my champagne pop Becca
highlighter with jaclyn hill I cracked
it um I actually dropped it on the floor
and it's shattered but girl you know
we're still using this and just this
random L flawless concealer brush it's
actually a great size for that perfect
cheek highlight so that's what I'm going
to use then just dabbing it tapping off
the fallout and going right above the
cheekbone and applying the highlight a
little on top my nose because you know
we're rude up gonna make a stick out
from the crowd and then i am going to
spray my face with my makeup finishing
spray before i do my lower lashes with
mascara because if I do my lower lashes
and spray this it will drip down and
then I'll have black also much under
here I spray three times it's really
accentuates the highlight or two because
you're spraying um like doing liquid
onto the header which Mason shined a
beam even more okay let the dry for
about ten seconds and then I'm going in
to do my bottom lashes which is one of
my favorite parts I really coat these
because I just like to be like well put
your top lashes you got to do the bottom
telescopic l'oreal mascara yet again I
love better than sex but this is
literally a third of the price not even
a fifth of the price she's going to go
in and then go to my lower lashes oh
yeah I haven't applied mascara to my
waterline in a very long time I think it
just looks more doe-eyed and not as
intense and like all the time so that's
why I didn't apply eyeliner there
and with that ladies and gentlemen we
are done inside like I used to chasing
the hike and I can't keep
guess I
stuck between here and same elsewhere
