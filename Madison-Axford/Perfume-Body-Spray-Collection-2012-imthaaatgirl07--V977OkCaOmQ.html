cray-cray I just took it out of funds so
uh hope you don't mind
anyway okay hey I'm doing a perfume
collection video um six of them are from
a trade secret when I liked when Craig
Crane bought like a bajillion body
sprays and then two of them are actual
like perfumes from a department store so
I'll save those two for laps down
through the body sprays first so anyway
without further ado let's get started so
the first body spray I have is from the
Beauty Rush collection and it's called
plum drop and it's really cool like
liquid because it's like purple I'm
clear and if you shake it you can just
like see how it like mixes it looks kind
of gross but I think that's kind of cool
anyway I went to my friend's like
birthday party and she gave this as a
goody bag and I really like this smell
it smells just like fruit and I just
really like it so I'm very like mature
smell it's not really like fruity like
summery and Flowery not that but it is
like more mature I really like how this
smells so I don't know if they still
sell this cuz it was like all right
maybe a year ago but it still smells
amazing okay the next one is my favorite
and it's pinks shimmer and shine
charming and fun and it's just this um
purple like liquid with glitter in it
you can somebody spray down there to rub
it in and it's just super sparkly um
this is definitely my favorite scent of
all that just smells like amazing like I
can't even describe it just most super
sweet as little flowers like look how
cute this design is the next one that I
got is called noir tees and this is
pretty good smelling why I mean it's not
amazing but again a lot of these were on
sale so like that's fine I got some I
wouldn't go in there by like $15 fumes
this one just smells like vanilla it's
not necessarily my type the next one I
also love this was try my second
favorite and it's called
retiree Secret bombshell body mist and
this is what it looks like a lot of
people I know have this one and this
just smells like it's just smells super
fruity but I'd really like at least a
really sweet again I think I tend to go
towards the more
like sweet smells but this just has the
most amazing after smell oh my gosh uh
my my aunt like randomly has this tier I
was like oh my gosh you have um the
bombshell and she's like yeah and yeah I
just really like this you know yeah okay
you know any like perfume in your mouth
and she's like disgusting yeah that's
just happened next one again is kind of
dinner Marty's kind of like cray cray
and bottle off stuff and it's dream
angels heavenly this is from the dream
angels collection and it's kind of like
vanilla not really mine
you know favorite scent but I just
recently got this too and as you can see
I knew none so maybe I only give it as a
present it doesn't sound bad but all me
it's like I just not smell bad just from
my personal preference it's not what
like saying I would wear everyday
um but you know you as a present or
something yes isn't my favorite or my
type of smell but I really like it's
still for someone else the last two
perfumes are from the department store
on Macy's and um okay so I got them both
for Christmas last year I I guess I
didn't realize you didn't smell it the
story that they smelled the exact same
yeah the first one I got you're a
collection would not be complete without
do you babes perfume so this is his um
some day it has these little charms here
which are super cute awkward charms and
on there has these two terms it's a lock
and a key and then it's just this like
flowered um top and then you pull this
top part off in the petal surround the
little pump or perfume now this smells
again if you haven't smelled this it
smells exactly like another one I've got
to show you and the new Nicki Minaj one
I wanted that one but I'm like I already
have two that smell the exact same so no
point of getting that one but it's cute
little package I got the smaller size
obviously because the other one I got in
full-size Hey but I should really love
the smell and I guess when I run out the
other one which I use everyday I can you
know start using this more because they
smell the same and I can keep my
everyday sense so yeah um again the
smells so good no complaints I like
Justin Bieber I like his perfume and is
super cute
like the excise recorders when you open
to finding truck set aside to drive
lucky lass perfume is the Taylor Swift
wonderstruck perfume I absolutely adore
this perfume this make everyday sense
purple obviously metallic Ian bottle has
this gold cap and then three little
charms you have like the star thing a
bird in a birdcage this is full size
because this is the one I smell in the
department store I was like oh my gosh
oh my oh my gosh they love it and I'm
just like I want it just to be one two
and then I got in smaller size now and
like I said before it's not the same
this just smells so good it's just so
feminine so like chic and I love how
this was made
um this and their Justin Bieber one how
they took time to put charms on how's my
perfume collection I hope you enjoyed
this video I come below if there's any
sense that you think I'd like after
hearing what I like thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
