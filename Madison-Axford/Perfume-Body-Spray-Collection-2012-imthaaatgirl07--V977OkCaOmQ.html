and took it out of a fun so uh hope you
don't mind frizzy hair anyway okay I
didn't feel like doing anything to it um
video today so I'm like drop throughout
my video hey I'm doing a perfume
collection video I'm six of them are
from a troy secret when I like when cry
cry and bought like a bajillion body
sprays and then two of them are actual
like perfumes from a department store so
i'll save those 24 laps down to the body
sprays first so anyway without further
ado let's get started so deep our spider
spray i have is from the beauty rush
collection and it's called plum drop and
it's really cool like liquid because
it's like purple unclear if you shake it
you can just like see how it like mixes
it looks kind of gross but i think
that's kind of cool anyway I went to my
friends like birthday party and she gave
this as a goodie bag and I really like
to smell it smells just like fruit and I
just really like it's a very like mature
smell it's not really like fruity like
summary and flowery not that but it is
like more mature I'd really like how
this smells so I don't know if they
still sell this because it was like a
maybe a year ago but it still smells
amazing okay the next one is my favorite
and it's Pink's shimmer and shine
charming and fun and it's just this um
purple like liquid with glitter in it
you can somebody spray down your to rub
it in is just super sparkly um this is
definitely my favorite scent of all just
smells like amazing like I can't even
describe it just most super sweet as
little flowers like look how cute this
design is the next one that I got is
called noir teas and this is pretty good
smelling why I mean it's not amazing but
again a lot of these wrongs sale so like
that's why i got my one just go in there
by like 15 dog perfumes this one just
smells like vanilla it's not necessarily
my type the next one i also love this
was by my second favorite and it's
called retiree secret bombshell body
mists and this is what it looks like a
lot of people i don't have this one and
this just smells like it's just smells
super fruity but I'd really like at
least i think really sweet again i think
i tend to go towards the more
like sweet smells but this just has the
most amazing after smell oh my gosh um I
my aunt like randomly has this tiered I
was like oh my gosh you have um the
bombshell and she's like yeah yeah I
just really like this you know yeah okay
you don't like perfume in your mouth it
tastes like disgusting yeah that just
happened the next one again is kind of
dinner Morty's kind of went crazy and
blah blah stuff and it's dream angels
heavenly this is from the dream angels
collection and it's kind of like vanilla
not really mine you know favorite scent
but I just recently got this too and I
was because I knew none so maybe only
give it as a present it doesn't smell
bad but all me it's like just not smell
bad just from my personal preference
it's not what like saying I would wear
every day um but you may owe you is a
present or something but this isn't my
favorite or my type of smell but i
really like it's still for someone else
the last two perfumes are from the
department store on macy's and um okay
so i got them both for Christmas last
year I I guess I didn't realize I didn't
smell it the store that they smelled the
exact same yeah the first one I got your
collection would not be complete without
do you babes perfume so this is his um
someday perfume it has these little
charms here which are super cute awkward
charms not on there has these two terms
it's luck in a key and then it's just
this like flowered um top and then you
pull this top part off in the pedal
surround the little pump or perfume now
this smells again if you haven't smelled
this it smells exactly like another one
I've got to show you and the new Nicki
Minaj one I wanted that one but I'm like
I really have to this one the exact same
so no point in getting that one but it's
cute little package i got the smaller
size obviously because the other one I
got in full size hey but actually really
love the smell and I guess when I run
out of the other one which I use every
day I can you know start using this more
because there's no the same and I can
keep my everyday sense so yeah um again
the smells so good no complaints I like
Justin Bieber I like his perfume and is
super cute
games like today I exact record of 100
vendors find a truck set aside to dry by
making terrific lucky lass perfume is
the taylor swift wonderstruck perfume i
absolutely adore this perfume that's my
everyday sense purple obviously metallic
Guillen bottle has this gold cap and
then three little charms you have like
the star thing a bird in a bird cage oh
this is full size because this is the
one I smell in the department store I
was like oh my gosh Ramires oh my gosh
they love it and I'm just kind like I
want to just be 12 and then I got in
smaller size and like I said before it's
not the same this just smells so good
it's just so feminine so like chic and I
love how this was made um this and the
justin bieber one how they took time to
put charms on that was my perfume
collection i hope you enjoyed this video
i come blow if there's any sense that
you think I'd like after hearing what I
like thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
