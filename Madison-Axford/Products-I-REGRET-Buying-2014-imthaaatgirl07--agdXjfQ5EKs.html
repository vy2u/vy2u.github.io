haven't done my channel in a year and a
half I don't think well anyway it's
products I'd regret buying cuz there are
a lot of products that I regret buying
even though before I purchase things I
make sure I researched them especially
expensive ones or even mildly expensive
one even some drugstore products I don't
want to just buy things and hope for the
best
I want it to work and know that I'm
gonna get my money's worth out of
whatever product you buy no matter if
it's drugstore or high-end or whatever
it may be some of these aren't even
makeup products but I'll cut my rambling
and have further ado let's get started
so the first thing I have here is a
jerricans natural glow daily moisturizer
I'm gradually creating a natural tan
color okay um I go through these phases
where I just love tanning all I want to
do is be tan I'm not going through one
of those right now okay my pasty skin I
always look for a good tanner and I love
banana boats I've already talked about
on this channel but I hate Jergens
because this does not do anything me I'm
very pale so I went quick and easy color
I don't want to have to put this on
every day to get minimal gradual maybe
not even any color no I want color
that's like BAM Here I am I don't want
this this did absolutely absolutely
nothing for me this didn't even get
color over like a week or two of usage I
literally have so much left of this it's
like up to here and this did not do the
job I hate this and it was a waste of
money
all these to raise money and it makes me
so sad but whatever it's gonna be
sterling the next I know it's not makeup
either it's my pink sugar perfume matte
Barbie of seven had this so I thought I
would pick it up because she raved about
it and if she raved about something I
don't know I felt like the need to get
it as you can see I've used like nothing
of this it's just it's not dating I've
never been a huge cotton Candy's really
really girly set kind of girl I like
nice clean sense more I feel that's just
my opinion personally I think it just
smell this because it was in a box all
grabbed when I bought it but I just had
to go from Metro sevens reviews and
other people's reviews who loves you
this it's disgusting
it is nauseating I literally get a
headache or feel nauseous like I'm about
to throw up everywhere when I wear this
I wear this in my Valentines Day
tutorials and I was like the first one
we use it and I'm usually twice since
like a buffoon we're trying since it was
expensive for picture I did get the
smaller version though but oh my god
everyone raised about this perfume and
it was expensive and it's just
disgusting it is disgusting
Oh first make it Prada to have is
Maybelline's baby see an instant pore
eraser he's using this as like a pore
minimizer and of primer I don't think I
did anything primer wise and my pores
definitely were not minimized I actually
hated this it was just greasy like I was
just sitting on my skin it wasn't
sinking and it wasn't doing anything
beneficial and it just sucked it was
just like greasy and like I didn't even
put my makeup on top of it but I did I
used it all up for the most part and now
we have one of the most disappointing
products because was the most expensive
I think this was 50 60 bucks
it's the Laura Mercier silk cream
foundation in the lightest shade because
I went to like a stand and had them like
I had them like do my makeups like
professionally so I knew exactly what
color I wanted I went through this weird
stage where it wouldn't be really really
pale and because that's my skin tone I
wouldn't have my thing matched my skin
tone exactly Sarah Belle wore this um
Elle Fowler wore this so I was like oh
my god I love it
their skin is kind of similar to mine
it'll work perfectly and so I bought
this so expensive and it sucks I just
not blend it just sits on top of your
skin I hate this it's so disappointing
cuz I lost all that money and I can't
return obviously and you expect when
someone reso it's such a high-end
product you expect it to be great and no
it sucked so much this like makes me mad
just sitting or thinking about it but
anyway I have another foundation BB
cream it's the L'Oreal magic skin
beautifier BB cream in like I feel like
with BB creams you have like oh my hair
like cute three shapes to pick from so
any shades gonna be really orange and
really way too dark this stuff comes out
white and then it's apparently matches
your skin tone is so orange it's
disgusting it's grainy it's grey see it
like runs off my hand before I can even
apply it to my face it's so watery and
wet and just shiny I just hated this
everything you don't want any BB cream
in a foundation in one I do not like
this do not buy this no also if you're
looking for a Beauty Blender I know they
may be twenty dollars or maybe a bit of
an investment for just something to
apply your makeup with when you're you
know you know I'm getting makeup with it
is just so you to apply your makeup with
but do not buy the ones at forever 21 oh
my god this is so dense I can't even
squish it I try
use it as seemed like the dirtiness it
did not work I said I was gonna be just
like a Beautyblender I was like oh my
god why am i buying a 29 B blender when
I could buy like a 1 $2 sponge from
forever21 medicine do not buy I wanted
to dollar sponge from forever21 this is
Cho guess it does not work the same way
if you deep under dust under the water
when you're cleaning it when you're
applying it it's like this so tiny it's
not squishy I think about the Beauty
Blender and white so grace is so
flexible and it puts on your foundation
flawlessly seamlessly perfect this just
it I can't even hold that it's just it
just like doesn't even put your
foundation on it's just like smears that
it is awful does not do what a beauty
blender does they're not the same thing
we have another fetish at the Revlon
Colorstay 24 hours foundation this stuff
is kind of like the laura mercier still
cream foundation it just sets on your
skin it doesn't blend it um it sucks
it's just so thick in a disgusting way
it smells really bad it's like so gooey
and then we have a very disappointing
one as well which is the L'Oreal
voluminous miss manga
I love L'Oreal mascaras this brush first
of all it came like dried out I don't
know if I just got a really bad weird
one or if they're all like this
um but first of all it's a brush like
bends all the way over it's like at 360
Bend and I like my brushes and my wands
or whatever I'm applying my mascara with
to be a very first but the fact that
this bends it is so flexible and flimsy
and you know in a really bad way it just
put on my mascara so crapoly did
absolutely nothing it clumped them all
together I hate this it's like a greyish
color to like I think I got the shade
like I always get blackest black or
black like I never get brown eye thing
but I came out really gray I was really
looking forward to this because there
were so many television commercials and
so many people were like new mascara
from oil no no it was just bad I just
hated ice like twice below the next part
of use one that I just grabbed is who
went to Target it's the NYC I'm medic
eyeliner pencil and basic black it's
just a quick waxy roll-on like roll up
eyeliner that I cuz I need a new
eyeliner and this one sucks so much it
comes out so dry it's like a great color
just like the miss manga mascara it's
not vibrant it does not go on your
water line with any ease whatsoever it
like doesn't come off it's like dried
out again I don't know if I got a weird
one or if they're all like this I'm
pretty sure they're all like this though
because I've never been a fan of NYC
products of any of anything really
anything that they make anybody the last
probably ever guard buying is buy a vine
you might not know this company but they
are a makeup company maybe you do maybe
you don't
I don't know it's the brand name
concealer and this is what I used for a
brightener for like a little bit like a
year ago and Jem it comes out like
beautiful very very pearly color and
then I put it on it's just I put it on
it like peels off it's kind of like if
you know eyelash glue after a dries it's
very tacky and you can kind of like
stretch it and then it like rips off of
the eyelash or your eye or whatever if I
just like roll to blend it and it'll
just roll off like dried glue what so
that was my products I forgot bye I hope
