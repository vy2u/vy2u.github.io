regret buying tag I have quite a few
products um yeah there's not like a lot
of expensive products that I regret
buying thankfully but these are just
ones that I am trying to tell people not
to buy from my perspective they just did
not work for me um if they worked for
you
sorry that's totally fine some products
might work for me that don't for you but
these didn't work for me so without
further ado let's get started so the
first pride to have is CoverGirl's
nature luck lipstick this is one of
their lipsticks in the shade 220 peony
so I bought this because Taylor Swift is
their covergirl for this nature luck
stuff and I was like I really want to
try this this looks like dark red for
like fall or something and I was looking
for a nice red that wasn't so bright and
me on it and I thought this was perfect
I put it on and it comes to cost almost
like a pinkish it's very very very sheer
not what I was looking for guess it's
supposed to be like very white cuz like
nature luxe but ya know I was not a fan
of this I mean maybe this would be a
pretty color if someone wanted it but
the fact that I wanted a nice dark red
shade this just didn't work for me and
the next part it's also a whoo lipstick
by NYX I have this like trouble with
buying lipsticks like and none of them
ever work for me I have another lipstick
in this video like it's just I'm such a
fail with lipsticks I hear reviews and
I'm like oh
everyone else seemed to like this I must
and like I don't I don't know if to my
lips or what this is Nyx's lip smacking
fun colors and in the shade 5 before
harmonica this is what it looks like I
was looking for a nice baby pink cuz I
have a lot of hot pinks also like I have
a lot of neon colors so I didn't I know
I wasn't looking for that I was looking
for a nice baby pink that was like she
or kind of like a Revlon lip butter but
I didn't want to spend that much so this
was a cheaper alternative but it was
also a bad alternative because it did
not work how I wanted it and it looks
like I had some lip fungus it was like
disgusting I was like oh my god I even
put that much on blast lipstick that I
have in this video is Nicki Minaj's diva
glam pink lipstick now this is a
beautiful color and that's not what I'm
complaining about like I'm not saying it
the color because it is really beautiful
and it was only 15 dogs which is
surprising for Nicki Minaj's line and
for mac lipstick it looked ridiculous
like it almost makes you look like the
clown so if you aren't planning on going
to like a Halloween party or a costume
party I wouldn't wear this out like no
offense the next thing is this elf
powder brush and this is only one
example of many
I am definitely definitely not a fan of
elfs brushes I've had some trouble with
elf products in the past but recent ones
that I've used I found that I liked so
it's like 50/50 either I like it or I
won't with elf products but elf brushes
are definitely a no-no okay this is um I
really like talked about brush their
powder brush and it's a flat top couple
most like kabuki are good for like
contouring and bronzing so I was like oh
that's good it was only three dollars at
Target
the first time I used it in a broke like
what what I don't I don't even know how
poorly this could been made for a brush
just brick cause it's like they made it
was like two parts usually a brush is
just one part and legit broke and fell
on my makeup table and I was like oh my
gosh I just bought this and the next
product is one by one volume express
mascara by Maybelline now I know um a
lot of people like this and a lot of
people don't this unfortunately did not
work for me and the mascara that I used
has to be good for me to like it like
I'm not gonna be like put it up if I
don't like it I want to like use it I'll
just have it sitting like my makeup
table have it sit on my makeup table and
not use it I'm not a huge fan of the
really really tiny bristles I feel like
that doesn't do much and for me this
didn't it just made my lashes like not
curl like it wasn't the fact that they
like clumped or anything it just they
didn't curl like I was like putting on
they just stay like straight and I was
like this is such a fail next I have
this Claire's cosmetics eyeshadow
palette so if you can see there's like
powder all in this and it's happening
because I took it on a trip one time I
think we were going to like I don't know
where we were going
I think it was Tampa yeah somewhere in
Florida and damn I like took this cuz I
was like obsessed it was like a year ago
I think and I was like obsessed about
these colors and I thought that they
were like really pretty and it was like
when I was going to this awkward stage
of using like really bright color
eyeshadows like blue and yellow and
green like like not neutral colors
mm-hmm
so I brought this with me and I got my
ID my suitcase I ever being off the
plane and this was just a mess and like
I run urban decay or steel palace and
they have not done this and this just
like exploded this is the best I can do
I cleaned it up a bit but you should
like you should've seen it it was
disgusting cutter was everywhere even
even see the different colors because
there was powder everywhere and it was
just gross that was a huge um like
mistake for me like what did I buy this
this is so crummy and they're not
pigmented nicer so you get it on your
bra you touch it in like brace it's just
really crappy but I mean it is from
Claire's Claire's is an accessory store
not a makeup store so maybe that's where
I went wrong
next you products aren't like makeup
related however the last one that I'm
doing is and the last one is the biggest
letdown of my entire life
oh so I'm saving it for last I still
asked the first one is Queen aliens mint
julep masks now every did you beauty
guru talks about this how it helps their
acne how the scream masks it smells
amazing it's so exfoliating okay so I I
got this because it was from Walgreens
because it was pretty cheap and everyone
raved about it so I was like why haven't
I it was like three or four dollars ten
stars for smell this thing's most freaky
amazing i experiment bubble gum okay so
it says put on a clean face so I like
get rid of my makeup first and then I'll
put this on and let me tell you this
thing hurts so bad a relaxing face mask
should not sting okay guys like fan my
face and then another downer to this is
like it's impossible to get off it like
it's a concrete on your face but I'm
like try to rub it off and my skin's all
red and blotchy and I'm like okay what
did this do my skin was better before I
put this on and now I'm all red and
blotchy the next product is not your
mother's beach made texture rising sea
salt spray
okay people warned me about this one
before I bought it so I was like I knew
that they're gonna be red flags about
this product um
not your mother's is a brand that I got
from my local grocery store I don't know
why I brought a hair product at a
grocery store but anyway I read all the
magazines about the sea salt hair you
know look like you just got off a beach
wave you just scrunch and go and it was
like eight or nine dollars like that's
pretty expensive for something that
doesn't work you know like what that I
tried
one time with damp hair like I said I
tried one home dry hair straighten hair
not straight in here every possible like
what you could try it
and it just left my hair um sticky and
it was like straight like like sticky
like my hair is like hard so I don't
know what is it I also try and bun all
these different ways to possibly
possibly get a little scrunch in my hair
to make it different than just this
plain natural straight hair and no it
was disgusting and it does not smell
that good either I was like I hear some
said it's gooey it's hard and it's
awkward like no no I knew this was
trouble too Swift preference and the
last product this is so so sad okay
every YouTube beauty guru I have ever
watched raved about this Maybelline's
Dream bouncy blush now the second after
I bought this and try this and hated it
all these reviews about how much people
hated it went up and I was like are you
kidding me like did I just wash the
wrong ones because every was like I love
it I love it I love it I bought it and
then I looked on the internet and feel
like I hated this is bad and I was like
what is life um I got the shade pink
plum for tea because I thought this
would be great look at this disaster I
had it from like a month or two look at
that and I've used it one time one time
okay no this is a fairly small package
you feel like a blush and I did not
understand how you're supposed to
attempt to put this on your face
I tried rubbing it and like nothing
comes off on my finger so I'm like like
really rubbing it as you can see it
happened I try to just push it like that
and like nothing would come off on my
finger so I need it on my face and like
just little clumps of it like cream came
out my face and I was like what blendin
and my cheek looked like a clown again
like I looked like I was like pink and
red this is just a disaster as a product
I hated everything about it is not one
good thing I can say about it I don't
know how you're supposed to apply it the
texture is disgusting Oh everyone's it
feels so cool yeah I just not bound so
don't think that for a second I could
hardly get any out of it and like what
are you so supplies with so this was the
only blush if you believe it on the only
blush I have ever bought in my life the
only bush and it was a fail
whose beauty grew and doesn't have a
blush this girl so thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
