product I regret buying video I really
didn't think I'd ever put up another one
of these videos because I like I said in
the last one I research my products
watch my other youtubers don't know if
they like the products and just I'm
really careful things before I buy them
yet I have like a hundred thousand more
products that I regret buying don't take
this too literally if these products
work for you or you love them that's
awesome and I'm glad you got your
money's worth but they didn't work for
me plus I love my now work for you
and doesn't offend me I'm not saying
anything rude towards you if you like
them that's awesome I love you but I
just don't make these projects we got so
let's get back to the back so I'll start
with the first big one it's really
random it is a therapeutic shampoo by
Neutrogena if you didn't know Neutrogena
does make shampoo I bought this at Ulta
and it's the tea gel original formula
for psoriasis dermatitis of the scalp um
I have very itchy skin very weird red
Norwegian renaud skin and I also have s
cough that's very dry so then it does
become itchy if this one was actually
really expensive for a drugstore shampoo
but I was like hey need Eugene oh let's
test number one dirt I'll just
recommended brand heck yes
it's did nothing if you have a dry scalp
which I know on my freakin contact hang
on um I wouldn't recommend this it did
not do anything for me they have another
kind of like tea gel something else tea
something else or something by
Neutrogena for dry scallops this one
just didn't work for me so it's like it
smells so bad - it's so strong and like
it was overwhelming in the shower like
it's not necessary the worst smell ever
but it's so strong and I literally
couldn't read the shout I gotta step out
of the shower to get breath cuz I was
being suffocated by this tent next I
have a mini elf palette I think this one
was a dollar is the blue like ocean
looking one beautiful colors just
absolutely beautiful if you can see that
it goes up like a turquoise light blue
dark blue and then a like Navy I love
these colors are absolutely beautiful I
wore this in my or sign date number two
video I did a look on it and I really
liked it at first then I watched it back
and I shall kind of bothers me again it
was only $1 so no harm no foul with
this if you wanna try out but the colors
are a little a little hard to work with
sometimes because they are so out there
it's not like a natural neutral you know
maroon Brown black beige they're like
Lillian Blues so they're kind of hard to
work with this isn't that big of a
product I regret mine I just sighs wrote
in here because it looks beautiful and
that's why I about I was it gets
beautiful
I want it that's mine but then again it
was a little hard to work with and the
colors weren't as pigmented and wanted
to but it was a dollar so I don't know
what I was expecting so I expected Mac
quality from ELF dollar brand I don't
know but it's just it wasn't that great
for me next I have a really
disappointing one benefits buying
concealer everyone loves this and I
thought I would but I'm not not not no
no not like the quality of this at all
and I love benefit products and the
benefit makeup line don't get me wrong
but everyone ranks at this and I just
didn't see what the fuss was about like
I was like like I did not like how it
came off here I'll do a swatch for you
it's very very waxy but it's like really
hard like I can barely get any on my
finger and if you can see that it's just
like like doesn't cover up anything I
really really was explaining this
product because I wanted it for so long
is a twenty bucks and I was so excited
when I got it and it was just such a
disappointment like some of these
products I wanted for so long like this
one and when I finally got it up so
confused because I just did not do
anything for me no no no no no I have a
summary cache guy I grabbed pencil which
I think this wasn't one of my favorites
because sometimes favorites if it's
towards um if I had a product or the end
of the month and I just like to the
first few times that I used to I will
put it on my clean favorites video even
though I didn't use it for that long
that's what happened with this one I
liked it at first but it's very dry kind
of like the Boyne concealer very like
dry like not much comes off with a
pencil if you can see that like it
wasn't good for filling in brows I don't
use anything to fill in my brows now I
just kind of stepped away from that for
a while because I wasn't really into
that anymore I was like I'm gonna let my
natural brows be you know enjoying life
so that's why I've known for the past
like I don't even know six months maybe
you know five months four months four or
five months I haven't done anything to
my brows just cuz I think that they are
good enough to stand alone they don't
need a little help but when I was
filling my brows for a while there I was
using this
just didn't work for me then I have its
Rayleigh random you never saw me use it
because I didn't like it you know it's
the kaabah kyon mascara that here's the
wand but you can take the top of it and
twirl it to make it different like you
see if you can see that it shrinks and
then it like expands okay pretty cool
but then when I was using I didn't get
how to like turn it like I was like oh
it's what is happening I don't get this
in it
oh it's made a mess so here's off like
take it away from guy and they like
change the wall on this it's a good idea
but it kind of failed in my eyes and
it's not like it did anything better
than any other mascara I've ever used
ever it's just kind of mediocre so tamia
a concealer that's very no Neutrogena
skank sandy blemish concealer it's like
the twisty one with a little sponge on
the top this I just know there's so many
other mascara mascara concealers that
are so much better that cover up so much
better than this this was just kind of
pathetic like I was just like this is
like putting water on my face I didn't
do anything it may work for you that's
great didn't work for me
next is a huge letdown again it's my
voluminous original mascara by L'Oreal
because I love Laurie look this was my
favorite mascara ever like growing up in
first trying out makeup so I keep laying
my hair it's just like oh you should
have it up and now how do you down it's
just like weird and I don't like it
um anyway uh my favorite mascara ever
when I started out but when I reboard
Maybelline rocket volumen better than
sex by G face this is just kind of
disappointment it was just kind of like
I found nothing special like about it so
it's like fine if you want are just
regular mascara but in my mind like from
past memories I was like this most
amazing mascara ever I loved it it did
wonders for my lashes and when I
repurchase it and tried it again it's
just kind of like no next we have
another huge lockdown which was Japanese
eyelash curler which is the heated one
so it looks like this and you kind of
come through the lashes you like move
this whole switch heats up and then you
like hold it and supposed to because he
does curl lashes more but no no this did
nothing literally nothing like it made
my lashes more straight disappointing
then we have the most as a wedding
product ever in my eyes NARS orgasm
blush
and if you haven't heard someone talk
about some YouTube I don't know who
you're watching because everyone talks
about this so I had to buy it because
I'm a baby grew it I thought it should
have it it's exactly the same exact
packaging for one the same is a
packaging as elf blushes let me hold up
it's the exact same amount of product
here's all plush like the exact same
amount of product for one yet it's like
twenty thousand dollars more this one's
and this is the same exact matter
product and they have such some own
colors from elf of these dupes
Bernard's are freaking amazing it was
absolutely nothing different except that
this has a smaller mirror thing that I
found so disappointing with this is the
color was just bled like it did nothing
I thought it's gonna be amazing cuz
everyone has to orgasm blush my NARS and
when I got it I was just like I can't
explain it it's just some people love
most people love this and if you still
want to try it you should just enjoy
anything for my skin
it's an Anastacio product it's the
breath it's the brow fix like gel
so this wax stuff is supposed to be able
to act like in eyebrow gel to you know
stick your eyebrows down and this
doesn't work though the wax just isn't
sticky it doesn't stick my mouse now I
got this a while ago I don't even know
this will sell it then we have my lip
products I thought it a lot more only up
for the first two things are flip boxes
that we're total fails
this one is L'Oreal color riche lip
gloss and I love the color each lip
balms which like lipstick so I thought I
love the lip glosses but not so much and
1:52 nude touch it just sucks this color
is disgusting then I have a believe it's
just a lip gloss by Maybelline it looks
like this metallic top color right there
and it's in the shade 90 electric shock
probably with this is it's just too
bright up color I thought I'd be more
dull than this I don't know what I was
thinking cuz if you can see this is not
a dull color at all it's very bright hot
pink but it's just it was too hot pink
for me and I didn't like that I kind of
looked like Nicki Minaj it wasn't really
trying to go for that look so so like
those aren't that disappointing it's
just kind of like they're really like I
could find something totally better to
replace this too if I tried then we had
this which is disgusting oh my god
maybelline superstay ten hour
stained-glass berry heavenly 1:20 I hate
lip stains cuz they dry out your lips
like no other this one it looks like
it's a weird shaped brush
and I put it on is just way too dark of
a color and I hate lip stains i I see
cheap prices and I get a little like oh
I must have that because it's cheap no
no you don't need it cause it's cheap
make sure you research the product I
didn't research this one before I bought
it and it was a disappointment so yeah
and the last one also one of the most
disappointing things ever to faced
melted liquefied long wear lipstick
another lip stain kind of thing I read
so much about these melted lip gloss
stain things from chief a so of course I
did pick one up I had a gift card oh
just I was like yeah and I wait to make
a card on this but I got the melted nude
color like I said which I thought it
would be way more new than this is this
is brown this is a freaking brown on
your lips is not nude at all
noon I went like close to my skin color
some people don't like that look
but I do love that look this was brown
don't call it melted nude I mean it's
literally breath it wasn't as much of a
like rough dry stain as the other one um
unusual lip stains this was more match
and like you could kind of move it
around still I didn't totally Drive your
lips but oh my god it was the ugliest
color ever and like maybe I'll get
another one to try different color but I
don't really like this anyway and I've
so much product laughs like a prayer to
give this to my mom she likes to call it
like the brown lipsticks I don't like
brown lipsticks I'm not a brown lipstick
person if you like these products again
