them I love sticky boobs then I have
Neutrogena makeup remover cleansing
towelettes and this is the kind of
mixing again the light blue is the
original and my favorite you know good
and dandy great heyo
so today I'm doing my empties or
products that I've used or finished up
number three that's a lot of empties and
it's a lot of products I've gone through
it this one especially is huge I had
like two bags of products that I
finished up I have this kind of weird
bun donut thing going but I didn't use
Donuts is just literally my hair so it's
kind of weird it's kind of lazy today
but I thought I film this video because
I am just like so excited and I really
wanna get this trash out in my room so
that further ado let's get started so
the first thing I finished up was I'm a
candle and I have a few more of these
but this is the mahogany teak wood one
this is by far my favorite candle from
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works pretty much my
favorite candle ever it smells like a
more combi and Finch or Hollister or
whatever and I did burn it until I it
wouldn't burn anymore cuz literally
would not light anymore it smells so
good I will definitely be repurchasing
this the next kid light finish is leaves
and I will also be repurchasing this why
why aren't my kids crap they're all like
crack down the middle you see this like
my lease is another great one it's so
spicy yeah it smells nice especially
like hot but it smells like autumn
spices and popping and stuff like that I
really really like this one next I have
to Neutrogena fresh foaming cleansers
this is like face wash and I like these
they work okay for my skin they don't
have any negative effects that I've
switched to a different face wash I use
Neutrogena silva's Neutrogena Naturals
acne scrub and I really like X is really
exfoliating so these are okay I don't
know if I'll go back too many times
Suk's I love switching up my products or
trying new ones then I finished up an
internet alcohol-free toner and I did
repurchase this because this is my
favorite kind of Cho
then I have a perfume from gap when I
used to work there I got this I'm gonna
didn't get free I bought it but I got
this dream more by gap but me sir I can
still smell this it smells so good it
was one of my favorite scents ever it's
so much product was in it and I used it
all so quickly but I did really really
really enjoy this so I might be purchase
it I don't know I just I don't know I
really like to this and I used all the
time people it was like really strong
and people get sack Spanx imagine and I
was just like me because I love it I
love the smell then I have two of my
Rimmel natural bronzers in zero to zero
sunshine I used these and I have some
still around the pan but I just kind of
moved on to a new one and then two face
products and they're my favorite face
products on my foundation and BB cream
this foundation is so I'm using it right
now again and it's my Tarte Amazonian
12-hour clay foundation in the shady
light medium sand and this one works for
me the best and so what it looks like I
squeezed every last ounce in bit of this
or I bought the new one because they are
expensive but I adore this it's super
thick and it covers everything and then
I really actually usefully stick BB
cream is the one by Garnier and I love
it so much but I finished an elf brush
shampoo this is my favorite brush
shampoo this is $3 usin that you know
it's not a huge investment and it does
the job on my brushes in Beauty Blender
and I bought a new one of these they're
great then I have my fit me concealer in
the shade 10 light and this was pretty
good except I literally ran out of it
like a week um so I don't know if
there's not that much products I don't
use that much but it was literally gone
but it was good overall when I 2
eyeliners I'm my favorite favorite
liquid liner which is like stiletto by
Maybelline then one my favorite pencil
liners essence long-lasting eye pencil
in black fever I love this one as well
on my waterline then this is
embarrassing but I get nosebleeds a lot
like a lot a lot and it sucks by my nose
so drunk so to prevent them I use the
stuff called air Ayr and it's nasal gel
and you kind of put up your know it
sounds gross but it does help moisturize
soothes your nose stuff like that it
really does help prevent them and stop
overall so definitely check this out if
you're struggling with nosebleeds
because it's great that I have two lip
products I have a sugar rose a mini
child when I got from Sephora for my
birthday
um it's literally disgusting I love
these they're just so expensive and I
like it in this little skinny bottle I
don't really want to get one of the huge
thick one so I won't be buying that
anytime soon and then I have a
coloration lip balm by L'Oreal and that
shade pink satin 118 and I totally ran
out of this - there's nothing to enroll
up I love my color riche lip balms
yeah the last thing in the first bag is
just a bath buddy works on Duramax
it's in hippo berry on this ran out
again super quickly I use it like a few
times it was gone and it smells
something like special oh great
it just smells like any other very
dramatic no I did the jaw is just like I
ran out of it's so fast I really feel
like watching your pan have simple
cleansing wipes makeup remover wipes
whatever you want to call them I don't
really like simple wipes they're really
dried out and I've to scrub really hard
to get makeup off like I've said like a
hundred hands before they do the job
though they're fine whatever but I
prefer new juji no over any other wipes
that I have a family that your mother is
90 nights I ran out of this so fast but
it's not because there was a lot of
products because I use a crap-ton each
time I take shower and then brush my
hair
it's detangler and I just love it so
much this stuff is literally heaven it's
one of my holy grails for my hair I
never use products my hair but I started
using the Celyn in the past month and I
already ran out of it and I love it so
much though so can't wait to get another
one then I have another simple product
it's some simple eye makeup remover and
again it was okay I want to try this as
people were raving about it but I feel
like it doesn't really do the job honest
and literally
so hard then I have Neutrogena makeup
remover cleansing towelettes and this is
the kind of using again the lightly with
the original in my favorite you know
well good and dandy great they have an
herbal essence long-term relationship
shampoo for long hair and this is just
decent shampoo
I prefer Head &amp;amp; Shoulders whatever I
wouldn't buy it again and I have a bath
and Bodyworks oh and it's the Meyer
lemon it's like this new kind and I hate
foam soap I don't know why I got this I
like the antibacterial bead things I
cannot stand folks UPS I don't like them
and I have another candle it's sweet
cinnamon pumpkin it was a mini one it's
like with a purchase of 10 you got like
a free candle with this nothing special
I mean I'm not a huge pumpkin ascent
girl um I mean it was okay I wouldn't
buy it yet I went through this one a day
I just burned it all day and it's like
whatever then I have a sticky bra
because if you didn't know these do not
last forever they will last about 12 to
15 times depending if you take care of
my missus and wash them after use on and
on i love sticky boobs this is when your
rent-a-cops vetoes back the shirts and
you don't want a bra bra straps or the
back of a bra to stick out and the rest
into lush products so let's dig in and
I'm not a huge lush girl I do eyelash I
like shopping there but I find myself by
intense products and not really using
them so I made an effort this month to
try and finish a lot of these products
that I had had for a while
so the first ones rub rub rub shower
scrub the thing I liked about this is
the actual salt like in the scrub I just
feel like when I play it it's smoother
next day a rose Argan body conditioner
um and it's like skin conditioner so
it's like once you like exfoliate use
body wash whatever this is what you used
to kind of cleanse them which dries your
skin even more um this I love to the
smell but I get it again I didn't notice
any big difference I did use it after
it's fully ated or shave or stuff like
that but I mean it's kind of nice
because you can put it on in the shower
so it's like putting on your lotion in
Charbagh for you get out of hand lotion
so struggle for me to put lotion on
after I take a shower I like never do I
have fish in salt it's a face and body
scrub I wouldn't use on my face this is
certainly though because it's kind of
like her I'd much rather use a face
exfoliator scrub that's just meant for
my face and not for my body but I love
ocean salt for my body and exfoliates so
well and let's leave my body feeling
absolutely awesome and smooth and nice
all around so yes I really recommend
ocean so it's one of my favorites MVB
seaweed smell really gross let's say
Rudolf I hated this I hated Rudolf no
then we had o to fix this is one that I
did like it's not very calming and I
just it was like oatmeal on your face
but I can liked it I kind of kind of
liked it and then we have love lettuce
again didn't smell that good did I
physically notice any big changes from
any of these face masks if I had to
choose when I was my favorite it would
be Oh depicts butts like nothing really
did much and let the good times roll
again smell was nothing special I should
smell them more pork bought them but I
did use them all up and nothing bad
happen to my skin so I didn't break out
from them I just wouldn't get them again
because there's a lot of money on
something that's just mediocre to me
they'd be amazing for you luscious
amazing products and not in fashion and
products but they just don't do a lot
from my skin particular my skin so
sensitive so they don't hurt in it in
any way shape or form they just don't do
a lot towards fixing and our making my
acne or brownish is better so that was
my long empties number three I hope you
