trying to record this video first time
is out of focus the entire 18 minute
video second time a huge spider was
caught on my window and I got scared and
this is the third time so hopefully this
will work out and I wanted to redo this
video for the fourth time anyway this is
my fourth and it should know of my
empties or products I finished up video
and apparently every time I do a product
I finished up or empties video I look
like a bum like always like last time
hairs in a bond I don't know when I'm
showing you my trash apparently and I
look like trash anyway without further
ado let's get into my empties number
four so the first two things that I see
aren't just my cleansing talent makeup
removers and these are a target brands
surprisingly I used a target brand
usually I'm very very particular with
what I put on my skins usually always
Neutrogena or simple or something around
those lines but I decided to go with
these because they were cheap and they
came with five extra ones in a pack this
is 30 verse like 25 for Nate Regina and
oh my god I love these I never like
really love anything that I try that's
knockoff brand for skin anything else
knockoff were a okay but like skin I'm
just like I said so particular and it's
pick these up because they were really
cheap and I didn't want spend a lot on
makeup remember tell us cuz I was going
through them like water oh my god though
these are so so amazing I like love them
and so yes definitely check them out
these are great grand terrific and I've
been really enjoying them anytime I go
she wants a because they are like 1 to 2
dollars cheaper and you get buy more
heck yeah
the next thing I see in here is my
caress endless kissed creamy vanilla and
sandalwood body wash and will ever
purchase this no there's just nothing
great it's literally like anything I've
tried before my skin is very very
sensitive and it like gets these little
bumps it's for itchy and I'm trying to
find like a good body wash that's just
like gonna clean it make it smell good
and this one just it didn't last and it
was nothing great so
next thing I have is my ninja doing the
natural space wash it's the Acme foaming
scrub and it's very very exfoliating and
great I love the stuff I've read Eva
purchased it and used like half of the
new bottle I just love this stuff so
much it doesn't have salicylic acid in
it and I just feel like my skin seems so
will clean especially my skin's itchy or
irritated and I don't have to worry
about brightening after this because the
Neutrogena Naturals brand and I didn't
even know that this leg existed don't
just look for Neutrogena look when
you're doing a natural
the next thing I finished up is my
favorite self-tanner I'm ready
repurchase like nine more he's not
really what kind of it's the banana both
summer color deep dark color I think
they have two shades of this and I get
the darker one out of the two because
the lighter one I feel it's gonna be
like a Jergens kind of thing where it's
just like naturally tanning and never
really gets you tan I always use just
during the summer and yeah banana boats
like five bucks and it's way greater
than any other brands that I've tried
it's like high-end or really expensive
today my favorite heavy duty great
coverage foundation which is my Tarte
Amazonian clay 12-hour foundation in the
shade light/medium sand I finished
another one of these but I'm not using
it right now because I get so much crap
when I wear this on my videos because as
yellow undertones in the foundation and
I have pink undertones in my skin so
yeah they don't really go together they
kind of clash but overall it works out
and looks fine but apparently it doesn't
look fine to anyone else on YouTube but
I love this it'll always be a good one
if I'm having a really bad break out
this is what I would go to because it
covers that stays on forever and it's
truly thick then we have my ELF rush
shampoo and I don't know what happen
with these but they don't sell these
anymore Target or at least in my target
so comment down below you know what
happened with these they have like a
spray antibacterial one but I don't like
that one at all
I like the elf brush shampoo it's a
liquid I don't know what they did with
it I don't know what Target or what else
is doing man you look online but I need
to find this again because it's my
favorite cleaner for my brushes and my
sponges and works amazingly and
and I really like use two of these it's
a stop selling them then we have my
favorite liquid liner ever which is line
stiletto by Maybelline Isis every day to
give me a great liquid line on my top
eyelid I love this stuff so much it's a
little on the pricier side for a liner
at a drugstore but definitely get it and
get the color black it's black because
if you're not what do you know when was
your like then we have my instant age
rewind dark circle eraser concealer and
I've had this for like a month and it is
gone already like I literally use this
all up in a month and which is sad but
it's the kind of everyone using the
sponge tip applicator what I already
have a new one is so so fast and it's
great to touch up they'll sponge it's
just amazing the little sponge I just
love this stuff to death definitely
should've said if you haven't already
it's wonderful and the last product that
I've used up is my covergirl outlast
stay fabulous 3 in line foundation and I
lost the cap Wow
this stuff's amazing if you haven't
heard me talk about it in like every
video I've ever done in the last like
three months what have you been honey
booboo chat I'm telling you this stuff
is amazing it covers up everything it's
just a guitar foundation but it matches
my skin better sorry it was not scary it
just stays on all day never crease this
never diminishes away it's wonderful
it's like 10 bucks at a drugstore I just
love this stuff
Holy Grail Holy Grail Holy frigging and
girl rail so anyway I hope you enjoyed
