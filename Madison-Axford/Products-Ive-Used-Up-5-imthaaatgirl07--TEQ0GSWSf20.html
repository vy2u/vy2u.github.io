number four video I'm doing my empties
video because I'm dedicated and I
brought all the empties that I had at my
house with me I brought I brought them
from my house to my college dorm room
just so I could tell you you know what's
up what I like but I don't like in the
products that you should or should not
buy based on my opinions these are my
opinions so if you don't like them or
you don't agree with them just exit out
of the video we don't even hear you
yelling at me for saying I didn't like
something or I did like something so I
got further ado let's get into my fourth
edition of my empties the first thing I
see are makeup wipes I tell you I just
always start with makeup wipes because
they're big and knowing in what else
when I start with its the first thing I
had was this jumbo pack and I got from
Marshalls for like $4 I don't really
know who makes them though so oh wait
local beauty care maybe they were fine
nothing great it was just like if okay I
would not repurchase these though then I
have the target makeup cleansing
towelettes they're just a blue kind I
really like these I'm I always have I
love the little rigid thing rigid is
that a word the little indent on the
towelettes they help them I make a lot
better they have a simple oil balancing
makeup wipes and these again they're
just okay
I think I've had a lot of these before
then we have a Maybelline instant age
rewind dark circle eraser corrector this
is my favorite concealer I went for
about two or three of these but I didn't
get a new one I got to make believe
Maybelline fit me concealer it's the
second time I've had that one and I'm
using it right now and I really really
love it
um so I'll go back to this one
eventually just not right now I want to
try some new stuff then I have a box of
3d crest white Whitestrips in the
classic vivid kind this is what one of
the smaller boxes because I didn't want
a huge thing mm I don't think this
actually did anything for me and it kind
of pisses me off because like I was
really hoping you know that these would
work and I thought very highly of them
they didn't work for me maybe I need to
try different brand or different
the 3d Whitestrips this kind did not
work for me at all annoying that I have
my Neutrogena Naturals acne foaming face
scrub and this is a face wash I was in a
lot of my videos as well I love this
stuff but again I'm moving on to
different face washes I don't like to
use the same thing more than two to
three times just because it's like why
not try something new if I get a bad
break out from choice I'm new I can
always go back to one that worked for me
one that I loved I like to experiment
and try new stuff so I can tell you guys
what's up but yeah this is really good
if you have bad acne oh you have like a
breakout definitely look for the
Neutrogena Naturals then I have my ELF
daily brush cleaner um
this stuff it smells good it's like this
one the cucumber and aloe and stuff like
that but it didn't really clean my
brushes or my sponges so it's a non
bacterial so I feel like it was killing
germs it's like a spray right but I
don't think it actually cleans them at
all so no I'm not buying that again and
I have my favorite is it cream or
whatever you know that white cream it's
always like on your peoples face when
they go to bed at night
yes that's my favorite clean and clear
Percy gel ten with benzoyl peroxide it's
acne medication but it's not like a
prescription shit's funny pickups
over-the-counter in a drugstore or
Target Walmart wherever I have another
tube of this I lasted forever you just
keep squeezing and squeezing and
squeezing and more active medication
will come out I just I love this stuff
and it does clear any breakouts or sets
that I have
I had the great lash lots of lashes
which this one's very old it was like
one of the first days I had my last
video so it's been here for a while
I don't really like it at this point in
my life I found so many new mascaras
I've been loving so I haven't gone back
to this one it's always a longtime
favorite but for right now I haven't
been loving it because I haven't really
been using it so yeah but if you're
starting out with makeup you want a good
really really cheap mascara look for a
great lash lots of lashes and I have my
Maybelline Line stiletto which is always
my go-to favorite liquid eyeliner and
this I have another one you know I
bought another one I bought two more
actually and I just love this it's so
easy to apply
I can't rave enough about lyin stiletto
liquid liner because it works I mean you
think me that I have a mess but it's a
covergirl outlast stay fabulous 3 in 1
foundation in the shade classic I agree
I love this foundation I'm using a BB
cream right now but I have more of this
waiting for me to use whenever I want to
I love this stuff so much it's always my
go-to drugstore foundation it's just
such amazing coverage but I have an EOS
vault
I always say this but like us fools just
get really gross and dingy after a while
and I don't know like charlyk scoop out
also like a like I'll be end chapstick
I'd much rather just get a new one
because why the heck not
so yeah this will just kind of got gross
and I was done with it then I have my
Rimmel natural bronzer and it just
crumbled if you can see this it just
crumbled I can't use it anymore I tried
to a few times and it just it just got
crap everywhere then I have my baby skin
I hate this so much
isn't my products I regret buying video
but if I buy something people are like
why do you use it if you hate it so much
because I bought it I spent the money
and it didn't make me break down or
anything I just didn't like the results
necessarily so I'm gonna finish it I'm
gonna use it so I'm not gonna just throw
it away and waste money but I'm not
gonna repurchase it and I don't suggest
anyone else repurchase it because like
it's not good it doesn't do it it
doesn't do anything so yeah I'm gonna
finish it because it wasn't making me
break out or anything but I didn't like
the results that I got from it then I
have eight voluminous butterfly mascara
Lori old mascara thing um this is good
but there will like overall which is
like people everywhere there weren't
good results with it it went on
clearance super fast at Target I
wouldn't repurchase it again because I
love trying new mascaras the last
product that I have in my Marc said new
stuff empties video is my Anastasia brow
Wiz eyebrow pencil in Ebony which is
like the darkest shade I think probably
one lighter than like
but it's almost the darkest shape when I
mind this again no I liked it and on and
off so sometimes I would like it
sometimes I wouldn't I wouldn't
repurchase this because it was very
expensive it lasts me like all maybe two
months not not very long I didn't
I used to every day but like I didn't
use that much because I don't really
need to fill in my eyebrows that much at
all but I wouldn't repurchase this it
ran out very quickly and it was just
hard to work with Sundays so it's like
on-and-off love-hate relationship that I
had with fish but anyway that was my
products have used up number four video
I hope you enjoyed these empties videos
if you don't like it you can tell me but
I like doing that because I like saving
the stuff that I've tried and giving my
true and honest opinion to you guys so
you know whether or not you should buy
it if you compare what you want to buy
something I like that's what's up I hope
you enjoyed this background it's kind of
not the greatest thing ever but I have a
cute rug so yeah thumbs up this video if
