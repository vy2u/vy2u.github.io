products I've used up video I've got
good and i could not get that out of my
mouth hold on major struggling anyway
it's packed I've used up and I'm going
to tell you whether or not I liked them
whether i would recommend them to you
guys and within that i will be
repurchasing these i love doing these
videos it's literally just me collecting
my trash in my room and then put them in
a video but i love it because i'm gonna
tell you guys if the product is worth
the hype in work bank so that further
ado let's get started with my empties
the first thing i have is my favorite
oil-free eye makeup remover by
Neutrogena at this stuff never irritates
my eyes I go through it so fast and it's
not that spicy I've seen ones of this
quality a lot of price tiers so I would
recommend this to anyone again it does
not hurt your eyes all week just love
this ever purchased this so many times
it's definitely worth any hype you hear
about it I left this product next I have
my favorite perfume ever ever ever it's
live colorfully by kate spade this is
the 50 milliliters bottle and I've drawn
I got it in August before I went to
college and I used to all love i'd say
maybe two weeks ago so in May so last
about eight nine months of be using it
almost every day it's just the most
beautiful smelt and i'll definitely be
getting this again next I have these
first aid Beauty facial radiance pads
that exfoliate tone and brighten your
skin while cleaning and getting rid of
any makeup or dirt or excess foundation
that may be left on your skin they're
kind of like toner paths I finished them
all up though I don't know why I'm
showing you the inside of this they work
lies didn't make me break out you know
that they did remove the foundation
thats left my skin or stuff like that
after i clean my face but there was
something amazing about these they
didn't help me clear up acne or anything
so I don't I mean they're not they would
say that they do that says exfoliant one
in Brighton they were shocked pads so I
don't know how they're necessarily
exfoliating because they weren't like
rough or had any grain on them that
would get rid of dry skin dense
but you know they were ok I wouldn't
repurchase these but they were fun while
I had them next time my favorite dry
shampoo petites dry shampoo I feel like
this is just me like rebuy my favorite
thanks and I'm using them and then
telling you that they're my favorites
again but um I go through this so fast
there's not so much in here which is
disappointing but it's helpful because
when you have dark hair like me you
don't necessarily prefer to use regular
dry shampoo because it comes out grey
and white it makes your hair look gray
and white rather than this which has
brown tint to it if you can see that
brown on the cap and wrapped into it
which makes it blend in more X I have my
favorite liquid eyeliner by Maybelline
line stiletto I've talked about this too
many times I came to talk about anymore
I just like to see use this every day
that I use liquid eyeliner because i
love the pointer application and how
long it is it makes the application
process of liquid eyeliner so precise
and quick and easy and then i have my
Holy Grail powder which is a loose
powder by a covergirl cg right there at
come on NESN I've had this for almost
three years and I just finished it like
yesterday the whole top is cracked like
this thing has been to hell and back but
I adored and I'm going out to purchase
some like literally after this video and
yeah it was full and I used to go I love
it then I have
then I have a body here by to scrub by
neutrogena it's the one that's supposed
to you know get rid of acne or a chest
acne and stuff like that in his body
washed at the same time it's has
salicylic acid it has salicylic acid in
it to help acne this did nothing for me
if anything I made it worse like you
just literally did nothing for me and I
love on HD no product so I was
disappointed when this didn't work i
don't know if i was using it incorrectly
but literally i was just using another
body wash on the my you know trouble
areas and it did nothing for me like it
got rid of no acne that I had in my body
and it was just warning so then i have
this neutrogena naturals acne foaming
scrub it's just a salicylic acid face
wash and I love this this is own
entertainer products that I love I'd
excluded i love all ninja practice
except like that one that body wash but
this is great i love clearing my skin
when i'm a big freak out afterwards with
this i'll use this for a while um as my
face wash in the works wonders I have my
favorite of brush shampoo this cleans my
beauty bun or so amazingly and tell me
if you know where you can buy these
because they just have at walmart target
then target didn't didn't continue
telling them anymore then what i was
gonna play sets oldham and now walmart
doesn't even sell them i'm totally
pissed with this out what the hell like
this is amazing and i can't I don't want
that spray stuff no I want a freakin
brush shampoo the big liquid gels Duffy
it's I love the stuff animal out and I'm
sad and I have another elf brush shampoo
in here because it's my favorite the
last two things I have our chap sticks
and these are the ones that used walls
at mizzou like I brought them back with
me to talk about them the first is Nivea
a kiss of moisture I use this completely
all up like I never used all chap sticks
and I loved this i bought the Sun women
because it was no my chapstick they had
in like the mini-mart in my student
center at Mizzou and it doesn't have
like an extravagant flavor but it's just
kind of like a basic flavor that doesn't
your take me or you know father mean
anyway and it was just amazing I think
this is like
hopefully one I love this member lips so
soft and I used to 24 7 and then i have
my chapstick toral hydration soothing
waisa switch this was in my favorites
video of january and i did like it don't
get me wrong it's just like it was very
I don't know if all chapstick star like
this I don't think they are but like it
broke so easily like I was putting it on
and it's just like broke and I was like
oh like it was like crumbling everywhere
and stuff if you like this i wish i
woulda got a different flavor cuz to
denise's has no flavor but i was gonna
be mint or something there wasn't but i
do like this it was quite expensive
though and it broke so what hope you
enjoyed my past I've used up video if
you're not already take a moment to
subscribe to my channel and check back
later for new videos I post new videos
