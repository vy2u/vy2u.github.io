to zapping the group of things it's been
a long while since I've done a video I'm
not sorry for taking a break but I am
sorry for not telling you guys I never
know what a break is really going to
come about but it was at the beginning
of my second semester of my junior year
of college and very busy and involved in
a lot of activities in clubs as well as
many classes and I realized this is my
one chance in college alive love YouTube
I need to focus on being in the moment
and living in college and not only
successfully you know getting the grades
but also living the moment in and trying
to house people because in a year I
don't have any of this so just giving
that for now and it's fun and I'm living
a college life but also doing on school
is very important to me and so YouTube
yes went on the back burner and I love
YouTube but it takes a lot to do YouTube
full-time and you eat it all it takes a
lot and I think a lot of you know that
but that's why I can't like clean our
videos because I am I call it a I'm
living my life and I do a lot of
homework and stuff like that and I also
don't have like some equipment down in
my apartment so there's many excuses but
Sam is you a quick Q&amp;amp;A for either new
people or if you forgot me things about
me I asked you guys really big questions
on Instagram picture phone and Instagram
at Madison Axford if you're not already
for updates of what I'm doing and when I
got anything video to associate when
during my life yes I thought it answer a
few questions for you today just so we
can get back on base and back in touch
and then we'll go on from there with
more videos to come
so let's just hop right into the
questions how tall are you I am 5'4 and
a half got that half in there because it
counts yeah I heard the doctor since I
was 18 I feel and I'm almost 21 so that
could have changed by really damaging so
yeah um five four and a half what is the
worst friendship breakup you've ever had
I have so many friends of breakups so
usually with friendships and I started
like following
a white day will break up and why I lost
too many friends over the past like
really my entire life
it's because I don't put up a
I'm not going to be a doormat for you to
walk on if you do something that hurts
my feelings or that's rude to me I mean
you want to try it and that's over once
you you screw with me so I really pride
myself on having a small group of
friends close-knit people that I trust
and enjoy like the way it should be you
shouldn't really be friends with like
300 people or trust rated people because
you know one of those people is not
trustworthy one of the people is only a
friend to get information and to get
popularity or whatever you may have that
they don't so I consider it also having
probably five good friends right now and
that's a lot and in my opinion that's
more than I usually have but those are
the people that I really trust and can
count on and I've had many a failed
friendship but I don't see them as bad
or sad or anything because if they were
mentioned your friend they'd still be
here if they're not good bye get out of
my face get out of my life it's not a
loss at all what's your favorite store
to shop at fashioned over whether I get
a lot of sponsorships mom but I also in
buying things from now like once a week
I love Ashley Nova so much I wear it
almost every note I worship nice about
Nova I was one piece every day whether
it's jewelry shoes a dress quote short
by whatever oh my god it's just my style
to a tee so I would only wear everyday
what are your most favorite nude
lipsticks I love this because the time
I'm wearing red but every day I wear
nude the 6000 I wear except for today um
but I have to my first one is maximum it
and it's just like a nice Lauren G nude
if you can see right there
hello this is picking up yeah it is a
lot more new than it appears that come
with peach but it's not and then like
this dark nude with no color in it it's
the mariah carey collection from that in
a bit of bubbly and it's literally like
a white mousse you can't decide you're
going to pick up chris is like skin
color but i love it
I'm almost out you oh my god oh my god I
need a new one I love it it's like the
nudist
panelist shade of basically concealer
looking lipstick I've ever seen and I
love important qualities in a boyfriend
quite a before and a friend is just
loyalty trustworthiness
a dedication I'm not looking for someone
who's like dedicate only need but
dedicate to succeeding at our friendship
because it is a two-way sync it's not
just one-sided so if I really wanted
putting in time and effort to the
friendship it's going to flop it's going
to fail and also those interests or
units from both parties but that's so
important and I think that goes over to
relationship too because if you can't be
boil and you can't be transferred in
relationships can fail and things I just
look for in a guy someone who can hold a
community a conversation I can rally but
who can hold a conversation who can
communicate efficiently and successfully
and who is confident within themselves
with our new MC Jeff and how do you feel
about seeing him Jeff is my best friend
he's Norman John's mission for two years
he comes back this year oh my god
yeah it's incredible tasting so damn
long we have been through so and damn
much and I am so excited to see him it's
like August 8th he comes back I'll hope
we've seen within that week of being
back and returning and I love him I
adore him he's my best friend the entire
world and I can't I just get so excited
and ecstatic thinking about seeing him
again
oh my god
like it's been a year and a half since I
last saw my best friend it's basically
like he died for two years but it's
incredible I just the first week he was
gone felt like an eternity and now like
at the place we are now where he's
coming home so soon it doesn't feel like
it's been that long
it really doesn't unloose comes in touch
every email basically every week we've
been through so much on that
strengthened our friendship our
relationship even more but it doesn't
feel like you think on that long now now
that we're happy and being successful at
doing what we're doing our separate ways
when he comes back it'll be like amazing
no doubt but doesn't feel like that long
like when he left first day felt like a
year now it's like damn it it's almost
time to return he's happy and excited
I'm happy and excited it's going to be
incredible hopefully I'll film it
because that would be great because we
filmed everything else of our friendship
on online but I'm just so excited what
values we get to your children's future
this is a good question um
strength is only okay how many Ounces
hook your strength is the most important
thing but it's only as great as your
respect for others is because you can be
confident and you can be incredibly
editing yourself and loving yourself but
if you're disrespectful along the way
you don't you're not successful in my
eyes so you can think you're like the
best whatever greatest person and you're
so confident which is great for you but
if you're rude to people you're not
really getting anywhere so you have to
know how to be beautiful in your own
skin love yourself respect yourself be
confident yourself which is a top
priority to me but also respect others
and don't use anyone's fails to get
ahead be successful of being yourself
and not by putting other people down
are you single yes I am currently single
it's funny because usually when I ask
this question or get asked this question
I'm not but right now I would consider
myself single for most heart it's a
confusing but I understand it what's
your favorite about me some of all I
lied it's my favorite song by Hitomi for
domination
how do you not let others bring you down
I really when people try to bring me
down clock me call me out the things
harass me I just laugh at them it's
embarrassing that your life is revolving
around trying to make mine suck because
my life is like great and so just seeing
you like over there like trying to bring
me down is humorous to me like find
something better to do to time are you
still thinking of getting a tattoo no I
am NOT I draw on myself all the time you
see that that's what that is
I've had a million in one drawings of
tattoos in previous videos from my 2013
on but in my junior year of high school
2013 June 12 2004 anything yes I was
obsessed a tune I was 16 when to get
them everywhere look all of my arms
wrists hands fingers feet ribcage tramp
stamp everything I wanted so many
heavies not joking like the Indian
headdress a skull a cross Bob Marley
quotes all this stuff I offer that stage
I still love tattoos
seeing them on people and I wish I'd
wake up my mind and just get one but I
can it's not because I don't like
tattoos or interior on the paint I don't
care right either that it's that extra
not make up my mind and I would hate the
thing I got like the next week so like
you wouldn't need to get temporary to do
and just like live for it's like a day
but I would be over it very quickly and
then very like annoyed and saddened and
disappointed that I had on me from the
whole way you can get removed but it's
just like it's always there you know
there's a scar is always there top-3
makeup essentials okay just easy Mac
Studio Fix
how are your foundation it's not cream
is hot liquid it's just like powder but
it covers so well Too Faced chocolate
Soleil bronzer the best runs their hands
down any MAC lipstick that's new and
then some eyelashes oh and Kevin D
eyeliner oh it's so good hi sorry I have
to go like 50 things do you like peanut
butter I eat it every day not joking
sometimes true 210 today what is
currently a favorite song only to open
my Spotify saw me about if I'm a snack
for shameless plug
I love Spotify to create a monthly
playlist of my favorite music for that
month every month I'm not sponsored
isn't it a rest song currently I've been
loving do Ali Pasha she's like
incredible so any one person either like
Lady Gaga diamond heart or Joanne make
me cry Noah Cyrus folded on love
incredible cash I have community mail
and the new oh you new nickname I know a
song oh my god all of them are grab and
weak so freaking long since anaconda for
these new songs and they're doing
justice thanks God
Nicki Minaj if you were a drag queen
what would your name be I love it I love
it I love it
um I hope he'll have a nurse - I have no
idea I'm going to seem really stupid now
so they don't have anything leave a
condom low eating a good drag name for
me would be oh yes but my like I've no
idea
absolutely none I always tell myself the
one and only so like the one and only
like the one would be like one word and
only would be like one word so it's like
first last name don't want it only but
that's a stupid as hell so we will come
- well what a good drag queen name for
me would be because I love that I need
that when I thought about that how do
you feel about God of God what God um I
love God I believe of God God is the
only reason that I'm here today
and I know that so yes I believe God if
that's what you're wondering what are
deal-breakers in a relationship okay
this is what I'm going to conclude with
from my best friend Audrey hey girls
love your deal-breakers any
relationships for me if a guy for salt
smell bad both know if you can what a
conversation it just is so key because
you can do all the fun stuff but if you
can't talk there's nothing there it's
not a relationship it's barely a
friendship it's not France you're
actually it's nothing so that makes it
so hard to continue on some of these
need to be able to communicate someone
need to be confident in themselves who's
I'm so confident I can't be confident
now for the both of us like I got me
down but you might work on being
confident in yourself respect yourself
have a future plan I don't care if you
want to be a doctor or throw a trash man
either way I don't care I don't judge
but just go for something like try for
something if you want to work at I don't
even know McDonald's at least try for
that or if you wanna be the president
try to like try have motivation and
devotion for something and someone and
launch succeed in your future respect
I usually treated with respect and I
absolutely treat like a freakin queen
but respect me know my worth as I know
mine and know that you can I me I
deserve someone as we all do who treat
this with respect who is in love with
being with us not I'm nothing like in
love with me our ID I know love's a
scary word but being in love with being
with you and loves hanging out with you
and being with you and enjoying time
with you and learning about you and
growing with you whether it's a
friendship or a relationship like yeah I
just want someone who is happy and proud
to be with me and who doesn't want to
hide me I feel like we all deserve that
we all deserve someone who takes pride
in being with us if they don't that's a
huge job right everything's nothing will
ever grow or come from this relationship
nothing will ever succeed between the
two people because things are so rocky
rough and I don't know it's like untrue
like it just feel so fake if you're not
genuinely happy in early sugar you're
feeling forced into it so thank you so
much for watching even already subscribe
my channel it would help me out a lot
interpreter for new videos also some
videos very often in the future I
promise love you guys so much and you
keep sticking around bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
