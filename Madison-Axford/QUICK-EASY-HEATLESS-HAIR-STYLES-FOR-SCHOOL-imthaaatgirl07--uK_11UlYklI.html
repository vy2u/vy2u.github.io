today I'm doing a video I've never done
before I've never done a hair video on
my channel as you can tell by this mess
right now you'd understand why it's
never happened before today but I'm
trying to do one today and this like
five quick and easy hairstyles so you
can do if you're running late or if
you're going to school and you don't
know what to do with your hair like your
make up some fleet and your hair's like
them don't feel like me and you're just
like so over it then you'd understand
the problem I do all my makeup and I
pick an outfit and I could come to the
hair I'm just like I could just hang
here I don't care enough about it
so you're five quick easy lazy lazy lazy
hairstyles you can do if you're like me
and don't give a crap about your hair
but still don't wanted to look awful
okay we're gonna start with just hair
down so say you wake up you took a
shower the night before or that morning
or whatever now your hair is dry it's
just kind of limp it's not really
currently straight it's just hanging
there
it may look awful to you but you can
make this work all you're gonna need is
a teasing comb if you have it or just a
brush that you can back comb your hair
with and some dry shampoo this it's
lifesaver I get out of the shower and I
spray this in my hair cuz my hair is
always like really really - shiny so
anyway what you can do is first you're
going to spray a little bit of this just
on your roots okay just a little on your
fruits and then you're going to start to
kind of like it looks like you're
itching your head but you don't use them
nails you just couldn't use if your
blood fingers go back and forth this is
gonna give it a little volume then flip
your head over and do it under here and
wake up those roots
come on hair get voluminous and then
your hair smells like this so then
you're gonna take your teasing comb and
this isn't this you should brush it out
a little bit very lightly and this hair
is just hair style is probably the
laziest like this shouldn't even be
considered a hair style but if you're
trying to get your hair not looking limp
and you wanna look a little like
voluminous and this we should do and
then take any few like pieces in the
back and back comb them just for a
little extra oomph this isn't all about
teasing like the point of this hair
style is not to like tease your hair up
to the heavens but to give it a little
extra umph and then when you go to class
your hairs all like that's the first one
it's very similar that it started off
that the second is how to do a boss boss
messy bun there's many ways you can go
about this but this is the way I do and
I get a lot of comments and compliments
on it when I do age or comments I might
Instagram if I have a button so I'm
gonna do is gonna take my hair all you
need is one ponytail holder okay
take my hair here and you're like oh
this sucks I feel I can't see man look
do I look too low well the point of this
is you get all your hair up as if you're
going to put it in a ponytail okay so
you know we like some fallout we like
some stray hairs it's a good thing it's
a messy bun and I'm taking it under here
and oh forgot some hairs and I'm just
gonna twist it starting from the roots
of my hair all the way out to the end
tips so twisting twisting twisting and
this is gonna help you get that there
rings on my stuff this is gonna help me
get that circular formation without
using a donut because donuts are so 2013
and they're not cool anymore
so messy buns are not supposed to be
perfect so then you're just gonna take
it you're gonna wrap it around itself
until you get the tiny bun that you
desire and I'm gonna live this around
now it don't look that cute but that's
when you just got to work with it
okay so pull a little out stick a little
back in pull it out till you get that
bun formation that's nice and that you
like and it's not supposed to look like
it was professionally done fat supposed
to look it's a very nice button and then
you plug these straight hairs down here
or at least I do you can keep them in I
think it looks a little more messy and
then keep fooling around with this and
that kinda looks circular but it looks
like you put a lot of time into it run
really it took you two seconds and it
kinda looks like if you look up
close but if you look far away it's like
yes I'm a messy bun and that's the key
is just to play with it until you get
the shape information that you like if
you want to spice it up you can add a
little PIP and this makes it look so
fancy look exactly like ten extra like
ounces of classiness to this look now
I'm just like waking up out of bed and I
don't have time to even twirl my hair
and we're just doing messy but I will
delete jus that it's like I get all the
hair up here and then I just take this
and do like this thing I just wrap it
around and like that's it and then just
kinda like pull this out so it's like a
bigger messy bun and then I'll literally
go to class like this and be like hi
apparently I have Mickey Mouse ears on
my head today
looks like mattress but hey it gives the
hair
face and you're good to go it kind of
sig bow like you could pull this hair up
that's in the back and cut it down the
center and then wrap it around and it
looks like a bow I mean it's like ten
hairstyles in one I thought this is
pretty cute the fourth is the loose
ponytail and what I don't what I do not
recommend is um like getting all your
hair up here and like unless you like a
cheerleader to answer something we're
gonna need your hair like this like I
don't recommend that I like loose and
messy and so if you're running late you
don't got time to brush your hair into a
ponytail we're gonna do is we're gonna
start it kind of low kind of like the
back of your head and very loose like do
not even let the point I'll touch the
back of your head just I feel like you
can't see that let me try again
alright so just like out here like it's
gonna you're gonna feel like it looks
awful but it won't so kind of lower back
head and then she kind of hang there
like that okay and then what you're
gonna do is you could leave it like this
you can feel like oh but no that's not
what I do I take it and then I doing
this and I move it up like a higher pony
but it's very loose and very messy I
pull these out again and it's a nice
ponytail it gives you a lot of volume
right here like you can pull this out a
little bit and it gives you a lot of
like body throughout your hair rather
than being split tight back else you
want that look that's fine but this is
just a messy like and then also you add
the headband again now your guys are
seeing why I never do hair tutorials but
this isn't supposed to be like boss like
zoella hair just hairstyle to the whirls
this is like what Madison does on
everyday basis next thing I do is kind
of like the ariana grande hairstyle
sometimes I want to do this and one of
my recent Instagram pictures I did this
but so you're just gonna take like how
about half or a little like no like a
third of your hair I don't need to use
it or anything unless you want like a
big poof and you're just gonna tie a
ponytail under it
I also like to make this one loose so
that once it's down I can like tighten
like that and then they'll be like on
top of my head because I don't know I
feel like you're kind of to see that
there's so much in there for this to be
cute like you can see that there's
plenty and it's cute if it was like just
hanging on the back
it went pick you up so I make it loose
and then I just tighten it up sits on
the top crown of my head and like it
looks cute and I feel like it look makes
you look really young and girly and I
wear this sometimes and it's like
stupid I think it's kind of cute I wear
this a lot actually the last tutorial is
what my favorites people might think
it's kind of weird but find whatever
part you want and then I usually braid
two to four little pieces of hair so I
give the tiniest three strands of hair
and braid them and I just have like
little braids going out throwing and tie
your head but you should only do two you
can do a lot throughout your head but I
usually just do two in the front so you
take this tiny little strand hair and
you're separated into three is to braid
it and you don't even need point to
holders to like secure this it's just
it's gonna be like such little braids
that you won't even need to be secured
it takes a long time because the hair is
so small so it's gonna take you a while
to get to the bottom but it's worth it I
did this a lot well how's that Mizzou
and I'm gonna have to do it again cuz
it's just as a little detailed your hair
people my people really oh she's just
wearing her hair down but they're gonna
be like wow she put a lot of detailing
with those braids and you're gonna be
like yeah bitch look you just can't like
blending it with the hair it's a little
bright so if we enjoyed this really
random video so I don't do hair videos
I'm not trying to be a professional hair
stylist I'm obviously not as seen here
but this is just all things you can do
if you're this mess
this little just little tips and little
tricks and the little style as you can
do if you're running late for school or
you just want a quick easy hairstyles
