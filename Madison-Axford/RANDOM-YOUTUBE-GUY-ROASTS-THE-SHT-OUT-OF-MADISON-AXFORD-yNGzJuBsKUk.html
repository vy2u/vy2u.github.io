was roasting me again so it's time to do
a video about it if you're gonna roast
me or try to roast me you better be
ready for my response okay before I
start this not gonna intentionally
disclose this person's name I don't let
you guys see any hate or any comments on
their channel in fact leave a love
comment on their channel this is me
simply reacting to his video I am
reacting to this guy who's a fellow
youtuber he's wrecking my rich name
Jacob okay so I haven't seen this I'm
very excited this was literally eight
minute video an eight minute video of
him reacting to me so apprec my video
was even that long I'm ready to roast
you back so for a moment there I was
actually gonna be done with this kind of
cocktail waitress at site I can't
five seconds in but like the blurry the
blurry Google image is anyone else
living for it like I'm slightly living
for it
like it's like pixelate is fuck okay I'm
a bored with it to be honest but then
the shake of Madison Oxford they said
medicine Oxford it is Axford axe third
leo has a slapjack bird X bird she made
a video called the Jacob satorious
musher don't don't get me wrong at all I
don't eat the kid but I don't like him
either she said a bunch of stuff that
personally I just disagreed with and I
kind of rather talk about the kind of
stuff that I disagreed with also don't
take this personally how could I not
take it personally when it's personally
coming at me for what I'm saying in a
video of mine let's begin
hey guys so today I'm reacting to shake
up sartorius's sweatshirt music video um
we all know my reaction bin loves my
make from the sea okay just take a
moment rewind for a second
sweatshirt what gives you only 100 and
not it was usually so yeah I don't hate
Jacob don't think I'm like Katie it's a
cheater
if you are at the end and girl and you
clicked on a reaction to James video
you're obviously looking for someone who
says they don't like it so you can be
like oh yeah I think your ticket was me
thinking a cop your friggin little
you're all 12 years old and I'm sick of
it I'm sick of these colors okay you
start seeing I get it move the fuck on
okay you can't censor someone and not
drop the volume entirely if the clip
because it sounds awkward I could Jesse
Raskin fuck Shola hey are you trying to
censor the bed warrants you have to drop
the volume in the pit we all know this
Sam Mason T Jacobs on your bass music
video it's a sweatshirt
he's so let's just hop right in hey
what's up with the pitch what a minute
ago when she decided to go it show us
the scene where she's listening to the
song which I don't I don't get why she
had to show us the screen while she was
listening to me the song was perfectly
normal
there was no sound effect changes or
anything so body have to go turn the
pitch up and when you're reacting to the
video when you already reacted okay
first of all I rewound to show me waking
the song a month or so prior so anyone
new to my channel who didn't watch that
video previously knew that I had already
back to the song until I know what the
song is about connect to the song just
coming to this video what's happening it
that's why I reacted to his dance
minutes the classroom the sequences of
scenes that would create this music
video not the lyrics or the song of the
melody specifically so that is why I
showed that and I raised the pitch for
copyright reasons every youtuber knows
this when you do a reaction video of any
kind video audio whatever you have to
raise the pitch or alter the pitch the
bass the treble in some way to avoid
somehow getting copy written and the
bass was changed in the other video so I
raised the page on this one to it
differentiate the two there is no sugar
behind that it's to avoid copyright as
does every other reaction YouTube
channel like the switcher
trolling why are you wearing a
sweatshirt a minute it goes I don't know
maybe because it's called fucking
sweatshirt not sure what is that
symbolic for this song why I got a
random
that's the third wardrobe change in this
video
oh my you should it take you to make 25
minutes yeah oh here comes lecture
that's the fourth prayer clothes you're
wearing in this video and all you're
doing is reacting to the video okay but
there's no rule that says I can't do
whatever the hell I want in my own video
of reaction I would say to be like wow
Jacob's great thanks for watching I do
whatever I wanted out hard sunny one
let's hold up
what was that late and shake up with it
shit you think about had this perfected
how many dollars are spent on this Jacob
for this I still stand by that come on
it could've been so slick yes way what
was that handshake come on Jacob yeah
more sweat I'm sorry but that's lame
you're freaking out because there's a
scene where they're supposed to hold
hands and you're yelling it I'm not
yelling at him and you're basically
doing the same fucking thing coming on
here freaking out over my sweatshirt
changes freaking out over anything that
I say or make a joke about or doing this
video so that is your reaction that's
fine but you can't come for me and then
do the same exact thing who cares
it's just a video he didn't direct it or
anything he has this thing called a team
and this team specializes in filming IO
according the video directing it freely
I thought Jacob just created that all by
himself oh wait I'm almost 20 and I'm
not stupid
also he watched the end of my video I
say Oh director shouted I know there's a
director you literally think I think a
13 year old created this no so you don't
need to spend an hour of your video
explain to me what a team is uh with
your blurry Google image again keep on
putting this video up visit it was him
who came up with the sole purpose I
didn't say that one so we thought oh
you're saying good idea to make this
video was just perfection and so he just
ran out came up with the idea
no he had a team that helped him make
his a video really a thirteen-year-old
can't by himself make a video with this
higher for two thousand years late
if the editing isn't that good but you
still you freaking out over the fact
that he's one Ally later like hands it's
kind of annoying and I get it and me
freaking out over the amount of sweaters
you're wearing it's kind of weird this
sweatshirt not a sweater does it take
that long for you do it
why does it matter how long it takes me
to do a video everything they're saying
it's like you're trying to match me but
it's just coming off as really
irrelevant and unknowledgeable because
you're saying you just read new videos
really t you've got long like you didn't
know how to finish a sentence so you
just said too much bullshit at the end
agent really work it didn't land Roo
when I said remember all the so she said
in the beginning and I was going to
explain it at the end of the video this
is me explaining it right now basically
I got Chase is named as a business
I don't hate Giga Pretorius I'm just
reacting to a song that I don't like
that was made with a music video and I
also don't like that innocence this kind
of you bashing it's not me bashing him
because I didn't bash his character or
him as a person or as a parents
personality intelligence or anything
like that
so people have a really hard time
understanding what reaction videos are
there me reacting to the video reaction
video as a reaction to a video not a
reaction to a human being if it was
called meh sex reacts to Jacobs
territories yeah they'd be kind of
bitchy and it'd be me coming for him as
a person which isn't right but I was
writing to a music video the song I
didn't love it but I didn't say I hated
air though it's the worst song ever in
my video if you had actually watched the
first reaction video which you bashed
when I put two seconds of that backup on
this video and also how would I have
known if I like this meas video before I
watched it like I didn't automatically
say I was awful I never said was awful
and I never said I hated it after I
watched it but I didn't know if I would
like until I actually watched it so
everything you're saying is not correct
like it's literally doing the exact same
thing you said you're not doing you said
that you don't hate jacob i don't worry
in a sense it looks like you're hating
on jacob but you know no it doesn't it
looks like i'm reacting to a video check
yourself because you're claiming that
everything that he's making in this
video is solely him and is just horrible
for him to make I didn't say it was
horrible for him to make ever so I don't
know you must think that subconsciously
you can't say something should I be
funny and roast a person when it wasn't
proven with pure facts or speech from my
mouth like it this is all pretty much
for entertainment and
you're probably like oh it's just a
video you shouldn't get so upset about
it but I'm doing exactly what you're
doing except you're not doing what I'm
doing because I was reacting to a
three-minute music video of someone who
is famous who is popular and I had a few
things to say about a few of the scenes
that were funny you're coming for me and
how I look with my sweat shirts and my
morals you're claiming that I do all
these things I think all these things
and said all these things about Jacob
which I didn't say so what we're doing
is completely different and I'm not in
the wrong you want to react to something
that you're an audience likes react to
something that you like also because you
can't so I do things that people want to
see why are you trying to tell me now
that I shouldn't only react things that
I like I didn't know if I was going to
like this or not that's why I reacted to
the first one and then the music video
because I hadn't seen them or heard them
before that's typically what reactions
are you don't see the video until you
react to them so how am I gonna know if
I like it or not thank you see the third
peel he recently had been one of my
favorite youtubers to watch when he
reacted to Jigga for Turia's he didn't
send any direct hate to him to his fans
hold on no I did not send hate or
anything to him or his some rude ass
fans some of them are fine cool whatever
I love them but some are very rude send
me death threats and I would never say
hey to them still and I did not send
hate to Jacob I did not say or sent hate
so yet again what you are saying is
completely irrelevant ignorant and wrong
you're making up all these false claims
that I don't like him and I want wish
hate nice end hate and all this stuff I
didn't say or do that it was just
speaking honestly and he was making some
amazing points in that video okay which
I'm not that guy I'm Madison I'm gonna
do what Madison does which is kind of be
like what and overreact and custom
whatever the hell I do and you can't
judge me just someone else that's not
what I do I don't I'm not gonna planted
a few good points of Jacobs video no
that's not me you can't come over to
some other guy that's a man they're all
on the warning cuz I can just honestly I
think it's the most annoying part of
this video was in the beginning were you
making fun of the twelve-year-old
tone - calm down blah blah
in my opinion used inappropriate
language while doing it
Bert yes they're his fans but maybe some
of them are actually your fans
okay I'm pretty sure the fans that are
his that you claim are also mine are not
the ones that are telling me to kill
myself or that they're gonna burn my
house down or that I should die then I
suck and I'm ugly and all of that that
is not a fan or even a viewer of mine so
what I was saying was if you're gonna
comment that please get off my channel
there's nothing wrong about that I have
the right to say that because they love
disgusting comments on my channel and
that is obviously not to my fans my
viewers my subscribers it's only two
people who we've hate comments and
disgusting comments so yet again you're
gonna come on here and claim that I'm
being rude and sending each of these
twelve-year-old fans which they're not
all 12 we all know that and you're gonna
say that I said hey to all of them no no
watch the video one more time and you
can hear me say calm your littlest hits
because I want any bad comments on this
that's just me being a Normandy trooper
saying please don't leave hate comments
we don't like me get off my channel
Jessica everyone else does one of them
hurts my fans to is thinking about
entertainers like us is that we're
supposed to spread positivity but when
you're spreading negative things just
telling them to knock it off and stop
liking what they do like it's kind of
annoying he's not breaking the law okay
you're saying that entertainers need to
spread positivity and I do my entire
channel is about spreading positive self
love and confidence through young girls
and boys so that they're happy with
their lives that is what I stand on me
react new a video is not spreading
negativity it is my current reaction
whether that's positive negative or
mutual about the current thing I am
watching and reacting to for the first
time I don't know why too hard for you
to understand that but I did enough on
my channel and spread negativity I don't
know what this video is because it seems
pretty negative to me so you can't act
like you're all positive and
entertainers like I should preserve
positivity like you claim that you do
because this really isn't this is a hate
video towards me and you're saying all
these things I did wrong that I didn't
actually do shouldn't making them up is
that doing anything illegal but in a
sense you're just kind of Maddie you're
saying like they're vicious but I don't
think in a sense they deserved to
receive the hey
I you momentarily gave up oh my god you
just had the defensive vicious therefore
contradicting your previous statement
and then said they didn't need to see
the hate that I gave them I didn't give
them any hate that was a statement
saying to get off my channel I did not
leave them at hate or come for them
personally oh my god and yeah they are
vicious told me to kill myself so I had
to stand up for myself
goodness gracious I'm done with this
video do not be paid on this channel
like I said before leave a love comment
if you find him or don't even look up
the channel it's really not worth it I
hope you enjoyed me reacting to this
thank you for watching and subscribe
