video but it's unlike any other one
because I'd never heard of this person a
danielle cone I know who this was that
everyone keeps requesting it on my
retinas thank you for a week letting me
direct things thank you for requesting
things but I never heard of her Marilyn
Monroe's her song I don't know like what
this is oh no who she and how old she is
where she's from my favorite actors
famous whatever so I guess actually I
looked at it before I started
she she's 13 or she just turned 13 what
musically star 20 most popular damn
she's like a huge weight how much weight
she's she's assigned model what who's
this little Queen or five millions fans
her for single we should compete in
pageants what is this
I'm literally living okay Miss Florida
Junior preteen Queen what is happening
this song better be the best thing ever
that okay this is a coin we are dealing
with okay let's go right in okay Marilyn
Monroe don't know what to expect
I feel like deemed musically star that
has a lot of like um negative
connotations behind it like we don't
know Jacob song okay
so I'm not expecting that much from this
but again she is like Miss America so
let's eat let's see let's go oh my god
I'm nervous okay okay Daniel Cohen
Marilyn Monroe let's go
okay little Queen is running no no no no
no no why why is it happening okay I'm
taking it back to sweat real quick
sweatshirt was not a masterpiece okay
we'll make up with some sweatpants on
you know I can always be that guy you
can be about me on and on but compared
to the first 60 seconds of viscera
it sounds like frickin Mozart okay um
right so okay um why is looking
rebeccablack now driving like the friday
car in 2017 Oh like this is the same gig
and it's true the same company wait wait
wait wait wait wait wait wait wait big
THANK YOU to Ray J where you can when
you move from Kim Kardashian did you
come o the dislike and like ratio Queen
I'm sorry imma give you a thumbs up
because I feel bad okay but like let's
let's go you like your views though but
Ray J big thank you to Ray J I'm peeing
k - I look hot barred by the UM
auto-tuned off-tune pitched singing but
it's fine
okay okay oh it's just a hard to get the
rule advantage and she's literally run
to her random friend who's like four is
a driver's seat to fill musically in the
car okay me on every level
um okay now if your lives be so like I
could get no I couldn't I couldn't see I
tried I'm living for this look you
gotten so banjee look on there and
that's you know pristine Queen love it
okay but I'm having a problem with are
these banks held lyrics I wouldn't
expect much more okay Ray J really helps
you out how much of this with his I hit
it I hit it out and I
I would expect much more than man a Maya
man I don't need a few days they'd be
correlated okay that makes sense but
girl your first single you tear for
suggesting Marilyn Monroe it keep going
on a hoverboard too much swag on a
hoverboard harmonizing together yet it
was only like two whites is my like you
know this is a hot Afghan that but when
I'm searching you're doing a lot better
than I was what's happening why are
these grown men like road-raging with
these 10 euro this girl she took okay
why does the driver look like she's 37
this girl looks like she's 13 this real
like like she's like 1910 2 and 15 why
are there four people in a 3 feet er
back we was not positive musically news
videos it not see driving four people
round about none of your I see bus in
your in road rage with your grown-up man
is not safe no no no could you move the
three friends being like clearly friends
with disco we had to be a vestige oh
this is literally the most iconic moment
in history Ray J is in Danny Danny
Marilyn Monroe music video he I just
can't
because like he was with Kim the made
that tape thing now she's picanha you
you don't be Kanye and the Jake stories
need to be real see Kanye Anna Danielle
Cohn music video like
just like oh my god the step down okay
give this rate Ray J's riding a scooter
with Danny what do you think you're
doing bad in life just refer back to
this music video and know that you're
not doing that is Ray J is why are the
credits when where the song is still
going okay so um that was a thing I'm
going to go watch your career is just to
see like why she famously I never get
the people who like blow up on me sweet
like why doesn't a trillion gross during
these and I don't understand her hobby
as a car was filming this so it's what I
wouldn't like inter mama get Queen the
more than one yes I do
come on away oh my god
no no no what what is it yeah what is
this wait no what what
what twice why why is her relationship
better than any relationship I've ever
been enough hahaha thanks just something
wrong time thank you so concerned she
shall be young again but I don't know
baby man ok I said enough of it the
Thrilla she's like a queen but also like
wait I just so much is wrong so much is
not right here she could do better
it's almost a little well well written
okay still Ray J being in it is the best
thing has ever happened to me in my life
