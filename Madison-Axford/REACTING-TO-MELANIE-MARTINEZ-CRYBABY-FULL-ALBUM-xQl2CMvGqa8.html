Martinez describe a bee album I know
this came out in 2015 which might be a
little old for a lot of you but I feel
like these albums like a cult classic
infamous just like the greatest album of
all time according to it what was that
according to everyone so I line heard
out I think like maybe four songs off
here like the big ones that like really
push through to a mainstream pop but a
lot of that haven't heard I love
industry and tracklist I love that I'll
go along each other like kind of baby or
toddler like things so yes about residue
mr. popper thinks this is a longer
albums the deluxe 16 tracklist version
so let's hop right in with the first
track cry baby the title track okay come
on I already love to have a beat it's
like a baby like maybe noises I can't
separate I also love the like very
childish kind of sounding instrumental I
really it's just so unique her it just
such a sound I love it Vikki one is sick
okay he's a great opener I think it just
kind of defines what you guys can try to
be as soon as you can go in with your
whole story with all these songs okay
let's just go into number two which is
dollhouse you're like a reaction to this
wrong way I'm gonna put proto is that
crashing this or Mad Hatter what I'm
gonna direct you to oh boy
Thank You peg moving on to the third
track which is wait I'm gonna need to go
back and set one more time what
finnaly creo Eddie hold on and you go
back to this purse but all that's
sloshing but then they're like oh I will
go home just my insanity girl oh my god
I love you an instrumental like tracks I
just look like favorites that why I
really like this on next is carousel
okay like it lives on the grid freaking
State Fair but like a creepy ones clown
like a creepy o'connell here I was like
oh okay I'm getting my okay hmm
yes carnival yes whoo yes
there it is I got was it wrong okay
living
oh really like there's like you see it's
like a senora I'm really some I thought
I said well we're talking but like it's
so different though says now I had to
say like so iconic there's nothing out
there hasn't been a bad song yet I love
the theme how just keep going they're so
like together it just makes it such a
story okay more impactful moving on
alphabet' boy ah now it's a beautiful
your baby s voice I love it also sounds
a little like nursery a cradle twili
singing in the back
Oh rose gage drop I'm not okay moving on
so what an iconic Jam okay I love it I
just remembered something I think I left
the faucet running
moving on to training wheels when you
call me down good very good
so I cook fun so moving on to pity party
and no song this is iconic mm okay is my
invitations disappear what happen on
every cursive letter tell me well
morning yeah okay we're enough that
everyone is Azam yes got so good tag
your age is next
wait what's happening there little
monster
moving on well that was an experience
okay melting cookies every clone some
different it's so amazing
this girl uh is insanely so like I don't
even know the words to me like perfect
like it's not weird to me like a she's
like oh just understand where you die
like oh okay
pacify her go again wait wait I'm
thinking like this like Mellie
two-year-olds don't walk in it basically
next is a mrs. Potato Head Girl sexual
you can always call the session to
strengthen your vegetable oh okay
to go where - turn I didn't go get to
take over here like I suppose withdrew
it like you guys know I love you know if
you're innocent okay okay who does
matter I have heard this isn't a great
one it's really old my friends oh hey
like I you're just something okay I
could give it one day love it
but I know that's alright so play date
is next I'm not home yet schoolgirl
oh my baby Jesus goodness oh okay well
okay do you like this checks receipt
asshole guys and I love it next is teddy
bear Millie it to my left and I found
one bad one yet I haven't gotten too
many of them

they're also kind of Eli's little like
child is exceeded it and this is like a
beef hold on we why not
Oh God what is everyone killed everyone
I was track now I can finally understand
why I don't know why it took me two
years listen to this why it's so iconic
and huge okay finishing off the cage
number 16 don't let us down cake you
close the album let's go logo okay I
can't I will literally dies listen wear
this this is literally where the great
films ever my favorite Evan of all time
is random collector heart
this reminds me lively because it's
character based it's not just a bunch of
random songs pulled from like a road map
thrown to a disc
it's literally like so well thought out
show created like with the intention of
creating storyline is so sick and deep
and beautiful and weird and sentimental
and I love it Wow now okay now I
understand the fan base to everything
with this girl she's incredible okay if
you'd already know subscribe my channel
and help me out a lot in tune with our
new videos and thanks so much for
watching love you guys bye
to see that Wow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
