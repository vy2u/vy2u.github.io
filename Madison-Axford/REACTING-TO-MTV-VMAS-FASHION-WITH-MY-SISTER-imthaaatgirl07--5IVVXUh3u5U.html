and we're doing video that I really
wanted to do I've never done with these
before but I love watching these so it's
a good recap of the fashion that was on
the red carpet or whatever carpet this
was for the recent Video Music Awards on
MTV so I have a few pictures pulled up
that we're gonna you know it's actually
a website says VMAs because of 15 red
carpet they were just going to go
through and say our opinions on it we
don't like just because we don't like
your outfit doesn't mean we have
anything against a celebrity or anything
like that so I'll be like you hand my
favorite celebrity no it's just whether
or not we personally like the outfit we
have our own opinions you have your own
opinions so don't get mad about ours so
have further ado let's get started okay
the first one is Kim Kardashian and
Kanye West I get Kim was pregnant but
her stomach was like slider than mine
that goes all in her butt
I hate I don't like honey's outfit he
looks like he's gonna go to the gym or
like to school like random Ted shoes
like how many millions of dollars you
have random 10 shoes scrunched up hands
do you like Kim's I don't like Kim's
looks like a garb okay she could've done
so much better but I feel like she's
trying to do a little looser of a things
before she did tight and the Met Gala
and everyone like called her a whale so
feels she's trying to like take
recommendations so it's okay I don't
like the color but makes her boobs look
huge next to - iris now obviously she
was gonna wear something like this she
wasn't gonna come out and like frickin
gown I like her hair
I do like her hair like how she added
longer pieces the whole time because I
don't personally like the short hair you
like foods
I ain't seen any wrong because it's one
of my stars looks like chandelier the
only thing to awkward is like her
parents were there and I feel like their
play like it was good
Taylor Swift I absolutely hate this I
kinda like it that bad she could have
done so much better and she went all the
award she was gonna be up in the stage
it was a given everyone knew she was
gonna win I'll be words when she wear
something freakin spectacular I was just
like this looks like something she
would've worn to like kick groceries I
really don't like it I really don't I
lied I like her I like her use again I'm
not saying bet against her I just don't
like this like it's a random crop top
with like really high water band I don't
know
and Sonny Gomez I hate the shoes oh no
yeah I hate those shoes the dress is
okay it's just kind of like plain is
just kind of there what pisses me off
about this is she wasn't even recognized
as slim gomez it was just his friends
it's like oh and hey I was just here
with their girl group with their girl
power go girl's group and it's like it
was all her model plan and then Cinna
Gomez and I feel like swimming almost
could stand on her own when she had to
hit song this summer she had all this
stuff she was nominated and she was just
like part toes was clean I don't know it
kind of pissed me off I was like she has
made her own name for herself so anyway
Java is just kind of it's like fringe
bottom come on when you put it on better
than Britney Spears I love hair really
yeah I don't really like this outfit I
feel like you either should have focused
on the midsection or focused on the
boobs but like I think everything is out
like midsection side back and boobs are
all ours
in all legs Oh shoes so they like
scandals no their heels but they'll have
it's just not great Demi Lovato hey
there
I don't sleep my hair with huge thing
this year these award shows I don't like
this look by tear personally I know it's
really in though so I feel like they did
it well I just don't like it personally
this dress I really like the color of it
but I don't think it suited her well
looks a little too long or something Sam
looks a little up with her legs like she
showed off her legs more um I like the
color I just don't really like the style
Vanessa Hudgens everyone was obsessed
with this and I don't get it I get she's
going through that like bohemian flower
child phase which is great but I don't
really like this I don't like the color
of it I like the hair right there it
just looks saggy everything is just like
droopy okay it's like not really feel
your goes down in here
but it's like
yeah Carly boss very pretty face looks
like she's wearing a bag it looks like
she's wearing a plastic bat shoes or
hideous their flats oh my god Hailee
Steinfeld this is a hole so looks like
she's wearing a bib and the pants do not
look cut right why - look at her crotch
is 9 miles long I don't like your in
above I don't oh really flare pants
Kelly Osbourne I hate this okay right
there
I like Kelly Osbourne but since she's on
fashion police or was or whatever you
think she would have liked the most like
OnPoint fashion and it looks like a
guard like wouldn't you try to show off
your body a little more you don't have
to show it off but like where sanity
actually gives you some form it looks
like she's just hanging on a hanger like
a look sick guard Paris is her thing but
I don't like that outfit she was on TV
so much when like anyone else during the
whole pre-show and I'm just like what is
this Chrissy Teigen I like this I think
it's very pretty this the only one I
would I could see myself wearing that
like I like that a lot Nicki Minaj I
like that one
it's okay she couldn't walk in it though
she oh my god that's right Sheila could
not look at all she's like and and she
needed um rebel roles in the whole ring
of the stage Rita Ora I like the bottom
feathers I don't like the top it looks
awkwardly cut in the back not like the
hair in the front huh Bella Thorne I
first gosh I didn't like this but I kind
of like it now it's very simple I just
do the leg thing I liked it looks like I
found a little onion I like the mint see
phone call that I really like this one
slick
I love that sort of like the slit here
either
it looks like a different color oh good
okay really like that I think it's just
looks awkward and a little off dimension
wise because of her post yeah it doesn't
look like it's attached dishes
