never thought I would do it's a reaction
to my old videos and I never thought I
would do this because when I was
creating my own videos and when I
originated my channel I was like I'm
gonna skip that you know you to awkward
stage that everyone claims they go
through I'm not going to go through them
and have amazing lighting amazing
filming equipment amazing like jokes
personality everything's gonna land all
my videos are going to great be great
and take off girl I hadn't done this
ain't coming for me because that's not
right okay I thought that my channel was
so good and you always do and I would
never put up content that I wasn't
originally happy with or proud of I
would never put up on this channel
but some of those so I put up I was like
girl what I asked you guys a few nights
ago to tweet me on Twitter any cringy or
videos or any other videos wanted me to
personally react to and I'm going to try
to do some as well as others that I
picked out that I am watching forever in
a day because most time when I post a
video I don't go back on them I'm gonna
react to them see she give you my
opinion on my old videos they're not
good they're probably really ratchet and
I'm really scared but without further
ado let's hop on in
okay let's just get started with the hey
she's gonna kill me for bringing this
back up okay let's go I watched video my
hair and makeup everyday I love them hey

see hey guys this was a year ago and
like I don't even look like that anymore
like who is who is that who who into the
99-cent store and bought a bunch of
random but I'll never when I used to
censor myself but I thought I'd be fun

come out of this heart you want people
lit this comment section up with hate
comments after that they're like you

of created bubble

just made a circle that did not make a
heart you lie

past year it's incredible okay let's do
top video ever through those runs
underwear
gonna be your YouTube mom for the day
you know the itty bitty titty committee
a nice little bra would be fantabuloso
it's a little like scandalous a lot of
people think that if we're pushing right
you are considered a dick today
this is just shoes I got to me high
schools like I'm playing at the most
risk a video I can do and this was risky
for me at the time and I put it up like
it's big f you to everyone and I was
like haha and it took off and I just
begin my first viral video my first hit
over two mil in almost three when I
loved this video but I don't agree
having that I said in it I'm very
different person I have very different
beliefs
I was very opinionated loud into a
in this video and you can tell that to
my personality I'm still the same but I
wouldn't say all the stuff I don't think
I gave normal underwear okay
they may look little grandma but I don't
even own like any underwear anymore next
and my things that I'd like to call my
period pants so when you are girl we're
done we're done a lot of people still
see this video even though if you type
my name to YouTube it's like on her
second or third page not on the first
page people claim it's the first one
they saw yeah you looked for it girl
enough maybe a singing one never 4head
let's do hotline bling I loved this one
this is my first cover I did after a
long break from covers I came back with
this one and you may think it sucks but
I really love this song and I like to
with its own mind girl take-home let's
go
you used to call me on the snowfall Lena
when you need my love call me on my cell
phone late night when you need my love
that could only mean one thing I won't
mess videos this is your sad patient
actually it's not sad it's encouraging
because I've changed so much for the
better and it's just really rewarding to
look back and see how much I've grown so
it's only a little bit almost a year ago
but still I've changed a lot
I know it was happening what I was going
through at this point my life so it's
just Oh incredible I can't let any more
say make me cry just like I get so
sentimental over this because I have
come so far I just awesome I'll do is
just fine to hate the first one I ever
did everyone thinks this is my make up
the first scene but it's a Jo you know I
got that it has to watch this video I
don't people towards it
