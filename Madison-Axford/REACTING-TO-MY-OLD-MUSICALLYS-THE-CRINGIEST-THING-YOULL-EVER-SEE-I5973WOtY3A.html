reacting to not someone's music not a
music video not someone's music wheeze
but my own music leaves something that
no one needs to see again no one needs
to relive through balla make you with me
we're going to suffer through this
together
okay the fact that I started in squeeing
year ago during this summer I got
verified it was great okay but but my
music waves are these saddest things
I've ever seen not saying that the
shatter than peoples I watched and not
sat in an emotional way satlak so
embarrassing leap aesthetic that I want
to show you guys again no mommy
musically and that's probably to your
benefit so today I'm going to show you a
few or I haven't even watch this is a
blow to that so yeah I'm going to be up
here you know talking about baby Arielle
Lauren B shapes are toys you know I got
to be able to roast mine as well okay
because we ain't perfect none of us are
and so mine definitely aren't so let's
just go through some of these okay so
without further ado let's react to the
crunchiest musicals of all time my own
under this one
girl no stops what was it grabbed did
not collect that shade in light
Kat Von D contour kit I didn't I didn't
do that bitch there's many things wrong
fist first of all the size of this one
never took off like it was like ashes
they come back is dead and like it just
like that's great mom
you're going Bob also widened look like
a Jess elf bread Co like a like I
wasn't working there at the time but I'm
like literally look like I just got off
work and I cut a palette to say my true
colors are you kidding me that's so
stupid one more time I look let me leave
it so so bad
wait
somehow it this is don't let me down
great song but you know some of these
out if y'all don't have equally but some
of these in the clips and don't start
anyways it's not like um thing other
than my mine now it's like the gaps is
like I bang on Honda and so it is just
edit that down I didn't know that this
is like when I first heard summer
through one so I don't know what that
whitewash is like plus for an hour
waiting for you guys agree something
isn't enough anyway sugar this thank
Corinne G like we've inserted oh my god
you're like so like awkward no oh my god
okay you so dramatic I don't understand
I love acrylic nail just see me with
like four inch acrylic nails is just
kind of encourage cuz I love them but
it's just so not me I'm a beast I'm like
short fingers like that's I do so much
worn my hands when I had a clip-on
what this is Jessie girl iconic song but
I look like a sweaty toenail like
honestly I'm wearing like Oh zip up from
Nike just showing I like Madison look
and I know Michael on my hair's a mess
and I was a clean house all day Liza
bleep Meganium is great
I'm coming on my staircase you know why
one thing I cannot stand it when people
thank the leered I'm champions random
fun people say Aizen Terry better but
the point is I'll be mute it's not mute
it's not you it's mote oh my god Willis
you again okay it's not muted I see no
tweeter something like this busy mute
and I'm like no moose thank you Miss
ringtail for knowing grammar did in my
face all the time
what Americans like me yeah I look like
the mental yet what am i doing I'm like
intelligent like that's not a movement
that's not what next I feel fit in a
store like the music's playing out loud
in a store people walking by okay
medicine no okay there's a ton of place
you musically well there really isn't
ever need for a time or place where
musically but there is and it's your
room into the privacy of your own home
it's not in freaking Ross Dress for Less
store Oh another great song this saw
iconic the fact set I felt the need to
unbutton the top two buttons my shirt
though to properly lip-synch - this is
very disturbing to me tonight's game
Jewish joes are the clean side Oh No
okay I'm sorry okay you know what I'm
going to take a moment Chemical mark man
I'm sorry you had to witness that
yes
quick yes take apart aureus you know
we've been through a lot but I'm still
here for your wife Daniel this my phone
sell iconic and me dying
you should I wish it would have recorded
like sound because I would like this one
real real cringe with me out because it
was in front of a like a whole like body
length mirror so I smear sorry and I was
just like kneeling on the ground and
when did the guys pants on but I was I
don't understand like what this was you
can't even like see you die mouths words
I'm taking Rick like what what's
happening because it's so pretty this is
the peak of what I'm doing these guys
music with music with musically reaction
and so you think that mine would be icon
point because I was like roasted
everyone else but no my work just as bad
if not worked okay next this would be a
great song Miley Cyrus drive all fingers
yes but I like get a interpretive dance
to this on a bed I did that can motion
is dramatic as hell let's go Ally huh
when you
oh my gosh oh my god I'm having an
exorcism also I'm not wearing a bra
next bomb song but at the time I didn't
know it I never heard this one before it
was just like had come out recently like
let me just memorize his ten-second
musically part and I never saw this on
two like six months later where I stand
a live tour but at this time it into the
song I just like when but two seconds
you know musically Horus so now I know
that kind of this like it's what I want
for his that I like did literal
movements with this it wasn't just like
did it digit down like I did action okay
this is my favorite one even though it's
real cringe because it's frozen and I
liked it I made it so cringy so that
people couldn't say it was cringy you
know you ever do that we rethink so
cringy that people can't come for you
saying some of the current eh I know I
made it that way yes bunny bread bread
on my head okay you can see my list so
bad in that clip I'll just play I
believe the list without music right
thank you so it comes out my tongue okay
next oh my god again in front of the
flowing smear on the floor kneeling with
an sun hat on like I'm going to the
Kentucky Derby or something I literally
look like a drone in other words to work
from home and I do like wears hat
movements I don't remember this so
literally what detachment
I know I came into the work bitch that's
my favor on all times
um because it's so obnoxious
I literally instead galantis no money
and I bring money into it I mean I
Clinic though that was my most viewed
and most liked one so um yeah another on
the ground one is one of the me over the
same time I apartment this is the sad
part it wasn't on anymore to summer
thing I like reopen this app in like
October is like no Handy's go through
this again no never a good idea for a 20
year old to do musically but yeah I mean
I thought unless I hear a song like
literally ever so I did it to that but
it's like not even like a good little
song so it's just me like in front of a
dirty mirror doing nothing I'm doing
nothing point who oh dear Lord okay this
I was going I'm going through it with a
certain person at this time
and so this song a really connector I
love purse delusions and just touch
grades on but this is resurrected

club made you like a crazy musically
