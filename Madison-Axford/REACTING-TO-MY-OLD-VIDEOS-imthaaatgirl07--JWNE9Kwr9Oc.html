with you I love doing these and I'm
responding it to old videos of mine or
like reacting to them this is off one of
my really old channels called that so
Madison butene you can still find it
here on YouTube there's three videos up
and I'm going to be reacting to those
three videos today I totally alright in
this video it's like I remember myself
putting so much time and effort into
this but I don't remember how bad they
were I'm pretty sure they're awful but
we're gonna watch them today so yes I
thought it'd be fun to go back on these
and they're literally still up like you
can go watch today's live if you want to
so what up further ado let's get started
the first one it's called celebrity
inspired tutorial Adele so I was
successfully Donal you know her 21 album
just came out I think when I was doing
these kind of videos or these videos for
this channel and um this was actually
right before I started I'm that girl I
think that's scary um anyway so let's
watch celebrity inspired tutorial
oh yeah warning I'm a total fetus in all
of these videos this music oh oh yes yes
I'm moving this so today the quality is
every girl and something that I would
win this is what I'm good lighting was
if he was going out late you might pause
it and I had one of them runs how much
was my good lighting copy though a
little poof like one cinema don't think
I could before I called it I used a heat
protectant which was Tresemme heat tamer
spray so now I'm gonna get on to the
makeup portion I currently have no
makeup
oh oh ye the foundation I love LP the
paintbrush a machine course okay now I'm
supporting a little on my hand in
rubbing it in this apparently my face
telling me now the thing about this
foundation is I really don't like it it
was cheap of me I really like it's cheap
as you can see I really have to rub
extremely hard just to blend it in a
little bit it just not match my skin at
all even though this is the lightest
color it does not rise gonna know well
nothing to has changed a little fetus
Madison I'm very light round I'm
putting grass shot on my entire garage
doors garage doors my black eyeliner
pencil in black ebony from Lancome yep

t-shirt and then these pink denim jeans

we're doing got straighten it or put it
in a box this is my outfit I hope you
enjoyed thanks for watching we're done
okay the last two do I have in this
channel that's the first video actually
know which I should start with but it's
clothes argot and mahal sorry for any
weird lighting ahead of time thank you
so much for watching and enjoy I'm not
gonna have some long introductions this
is my last video and there's gonna be
like a why I'm making videos but
basically I just want to say what my
channel is gonna I look like I'm in well
over here it's just gonna be like
tutorials tags ferrets of the months
hulls and my first video is in fact a
haul so I hope you enjoyed this video
and I hope you take good girl and good
editing skills needs to be monthly I
only went Target and a few stores in my
mall I wasn't finding that much even
though all of the big summer sales what
am I saying I've been rambling sometimes
like 20 years that I need so we'll start
with the stuffing out of the mall first
let's see what I got in my I have no
idea what actually got them I got three
things here which is surprising for me
because I personally love Victoria
Secret stuff I mean who doesn't but the
thing is it's just so boring it however
they had some very good sales going to
show that what you got talking about
what you got in sure oh that's not cute
not own that anymore it has love pink
written down the front and I'm pink and
it also says the word pink on the back
this was only just started yelling no
just an amazing deal from Victoria's
Secret close the next you think I got a
chill am i wearing in this video like I
do not know that these new products and
they look like things existed what am I
wearing
they come in handy when you just want to
have a lazy day in the way around
they're really comfy the first one I got
is just plain black and on the back it
says love pink and hot pink I don't know
those anymore either like I don't know
this so that's what I got from
Victoria's Secret next store that I went
to in the department in New York and
company this is also a rather expensive
store so I don't go there often and when
I buy things I usually don't buy it I'm
just like so far with this I'm sorry a
hundred things I only got one that's
worried but I want to see what I bought
like $12 actresses half of my shirt I
took that back like after this video I
was like I actually don't really like
how this fits like it's in really weird
and I took it back then the tags were
still hung up on his rewards though
these are leggings they would be long
enough come back right there cuz I hate
them too boy leggings and they don't
wear a shirt long enough to cover their
cut
now moving on to leggings are pants you
say every day you can use them
oh I didn't want to have them in the
video the first two things I'm going to
show you our both makeup related first
is great lash lots of lashes now I don't
new package because we're classy like my
expensive one which was Lancome doll
lashes but I wanted something that I
could just take with me everywhere and
if it got lost I wouldn't be too upset
about it because it was only like five
dollars but I had tried Great Lash
mascara before by Maybelline and I
didn't really care for it but I heard a
lot of good things about lots of lashes
the brush is very similar to with the
Lancome dollars every one looks like
it's in a cone shape which I really like
because I feel like it gets every last
when you talk about a restaurant like
that is Maybelline Dream matte powder
now I was wearing oh yeah this is what I
haven't seen my foundation like I only
wore powder and I'm just
I mean you know whatever for Tomoko I
didn't think I'd like this at first but
I absolutely love it and I would
recommend it to anyone I'm in the same
light which is the lightest color
because I'm so pale and we're done after
that face I hope you enjoyed watching
this video you so much for watching we
know our age we're home to subscribe to
my channel this one and become a fierce
