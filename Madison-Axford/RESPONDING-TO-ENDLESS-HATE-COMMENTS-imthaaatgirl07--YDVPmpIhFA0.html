favorite kind of videos to do and it's
responding to hate videos I gave a lot
of positive feedback when I do these and
I do this because I want to prove to you
that you shouldn't take anyone to crap
like this literally why I do these
people like okay you just want us to
feel sorry for you no I do not I don't
need your sympathy I don't need anyone's
sympathy thank you if you feel it for me
but I don't
I choose like I said my last one I
choose to put myself on the Internet um
I choose to make videos and I choose to
have this as a career and so when I get
hate comments this just - given you know
that comes with anyone in any video that
you do on the Internet so I don't need
people to feel sorry for me all I need
is for you to watch this video and take
from it that you can be strong and don't
let anyone no matter who they are or
what they might know about you let that
bring you down and let that stop you
from doing what you love and being who
you truly are so the further ado let's
get into some of these wonderful
wonderful wonderful I hate comments the
first one is one of the longest we'll
start with this one's pretty good one
it's from Alice gray your your spelt
wrong we're off to a great start
you're being really bitchy just because
everyone gives you a hate comment in
saying that you have our no life what
you just went back and saying the exact
same thing to them so what the you
thinking you are worse in my opinion and
that lipstick makes you look like you've
just done the Kylie Jenner lip challenge
I mean you are spot on again ugly enough
I'm not afraid of your response to this
comment because I know anything you say
will make you just as bad so I tried not
to be too mean but you're making it hard
and seriously change your profile
picture it made feel sick no jokes
lol GB bitch um okay
first of all you're illiterate
apparently second of all the only thing
I can really say to this is again pretty
much my intro explanation of why I do
this videos educators to give others
confidence and show that I get a lot of
crap what I want you to nowadays if I
see a nice comment that's surprising
because almost all I get are mean
comments nowadays and I'm used to it
because as my channel grows and still
smaller obviously but as it grows each
and each day which I'm so thankful for
it grows with enemies and with haters as
well so this is something I just have to
deal with I'm not doing anything of what
haters are doing because haters do not
know me and they're attacking me when I
respond to these I don't attack the
people who would do this I wish them the
best I hope they're doin OK in life and
our recovery after this day for the host
of these make comments on mine and maybe
other youtubers videos I do not respond
bad to them I don't call them any bad
words but you're making yourself look
pathetic and very illiterate I'm sure
you know how to read and write but right
now it's not looking too keen on your
part yeah that's all I have to say you
Ellis grey I hope you're having a good
day today but other than that I will not
be talking to you ever again
Wow index not at me I'm Jaden Quay rose
okay look at yourself nasty you go dick
to dick
Wow any video that I've ever put up
would not give you that from a video
I've done my videos would promote
confidence and give tips about life
makeup fashion etc to young girls so you
I don't know how you would have ever
gotten that and that's disgusting and
I'm true so please take your nasty
inappropriate comments elsewhere thank
you thank retinue I love how you blend
your flawless foundation down your neck
and you have half an orange neck by the
way it would help if you wouldn't speak
so fast but I don't mind since I really
don't give what you say I think you're
trying to sound the smartass with that
comment but you failed by leaving at
least three words that were supposed to
be in that sentence to make that
actually kind of funny and smart ass so
it didn't work you failed there it's the
biggest problem when you look at me is
that my foundation isn't the perfect
dispatching shade to my neck then I
think I'm doing okay in life so thank
you but I think I'm doing okay if that's
my worst problem exists Zoe xx
Oh a mess like this has like legit like
like 60 steps me you huh but there's
only like five steps calm down I do not
say like like like like like like like
that much like not that much at all um I
I know actually how to talk and not like
that and don't call me a ho it's a
garden tool you eat a lover dude props
to that guy for dealing with her the
whole video I would knife myself I guess
it means to kill myself
and drops my best friend don't talk
about him that way or me that way we
love each other and we loves doing
videos together and spending time
together so you don't know our
relationship so if you don't like me
that's fine but we like each other so
you can back off thank you too cute for
you the only reason she doesn't care
about what her haters say or think okay
the same good it's because she's a rich
rat she gets whatever she wants from her
parents she probably doesn't even have a
job who are you to say that I get
whatever I want from my parents because
I do not you do not know me and how dare
you make that judgmental of a statement
when you have absolutely no idea when
you're talking about she probably didn't
even have a job or maybe I have three
like I actually do so yet again if you
don't know your facts watch few more
videos of mine and then you can judge
but watching off one you know absolutely
nothing about me so please sit your ass
down and shut the hell up
Caitlin Irene harder I rather watch
Trisha Paytas annoying I love Trisha
Paytas I would probably rather watch a
sheep a this video than my own video as
well because she's amazing and who does
who doesn't love Trisha Paytas beans
less Lyle when when when you sang they
threw up well when I threw my prom a
Beyonce song is playing and she's
beautiful singer so if you threw up when
I was singing then that must mean that
I'm kind of like Beyonce so their grace
exceed you remind me of Cinderella's
evil stepsisters I loved them like they
were amazing and funny so it's already
an insult comparing me to a Disney
character that I liked so thank you
actually Tina bandies dice teased
just gotta be honest one your clothes
are too spelled wrong much the high
heels are really not classy or 16 not 20
actually on my
so I'm close to the age you thought I
was it rather than the age you think
that I am okay so your singing is okay
but stop putting it in too much to spell
again wrong go to grammar class before
you correct how I edit my videos and how
much singing I put in them three you act
really really selfish like you or the
world just saying no hey well that's
actually a lot of hate and that's why
it's in this video no I'm not the world
if I was the world I would not be able
to make videos now would I
Andrea Lopez one two three I don't like
you Luther
Fuki okay otto hölder field OMG bitch I
can call you what I what - well I can
call you a literate because that's what
that sentence was Bhanu Chuck
Mons I Aggies get guard your hair is so
racist today and I love to hose outfit
and I hate you and all the celebrities
of great outfits bitch my hair is racist
it was down in a little wavy that that's
like some of your own issues if you're
gonna consider my hair a race issue
Laura Moore never debated suicide so
much until she started trying to see me
eating the Beast first of all being a
beast is one of my favorite musicals
second of all it never talked about
suicide that is the most disgusting
thing someone can do and people struggle
with that every day and we lose people
every day off this earth because of that
do not say that that is disgusting and
you were not blocked from my channel and
last one is Regan Lafferty stop sitting
you are annoying so I was not sinning in
this video I was singing good try
I hope you enjoyed this video I did end
up getting fired up and you know
answering these hate comments with
fierce covenant demoness I love you guys
so much be another a to come home to
subscribe to my channel and become a
fierce confident diva like me on the
rest of us on here and Jeffrey cleared

week never let anyone bring you down
