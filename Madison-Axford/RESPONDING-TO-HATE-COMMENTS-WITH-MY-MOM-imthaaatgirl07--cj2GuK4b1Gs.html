you you can move on and just it doesn't
matter all the only opinion that you
matter is your own of yourself and if
you're happy today then life is good so

metal Mulan STFU grown up lol what are
you 17 18 a lot of us still dress up
because it's fun
who cares what is and isn't socially
acceptable life's going enough as is PS
your smile disturbs everyone always
constant as well
everyone always like Aaron says it looks
like fake it's okay this is the thing
this was my Halloween costumes video
okay in the beginning I say I wish I
could still go trick-or-treating but I
don't think it'd be socially acceptable
cuz I'm 19 I specify that my teen right
I hate when people earn 18 19 20 come to
the door knocking one candy that's the
thing even when you're 17 I feel like
like you might you should have a job you
can go buy your own candy right you
shouldn't be and they never even get
dressed up anyway may it be different
maybe if you had like a laboratory where
like a shirt and I like I'm a bomb yeah
like no pillowcase yeah it's for the
little kids that's what the fun is and
I'm not saying you can't go I just
didn't think it'd be socially acceptable
for me to go out and our neighborhood me
like right how old is this girl I don't
know she looks like maybe to him like I
clearly said I was 19 I think I said if
you want to go at Halloween
that's fine cuz I said it is but like
she just like you didn't finish the
video you saw me probably the beginning
didn't like the choice you could have it
