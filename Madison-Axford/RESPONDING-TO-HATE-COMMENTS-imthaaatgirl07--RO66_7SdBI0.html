position anyway today I'm doing a video
I never thought I would do again why did
I not think I would do this again
because I don't like constantly bringing
up negative people or people calming bad
things people typically comment bad
things to get attention from you um and
that's not what this is for but this is
me responding and showing how I brush
off these stupid pointless comments when
they've thrown my way so yes that is
what I'm doing without further ado let's
get started the first comment we have is
girl breeds
okay Lexi Sparks um thank you so much
for caring about my respiratory system
so I got a full breath thank you so much
it's so nice Taylor a says people can do
whatever they want with their makeup
though oh yes that is true
and this was on my most recent do's and
don'ts of makeup video where I literally
took half the video just specify the
fact that people can do whatever the
hell they want disclaimer because the
video I did of this a year ago still get
so many mean comments daily saying you
know you don't know what you're talking
about you know this is all wrong people
should be able to do the makeup however
they want obviously it's a free world so
you're gonna do whatever the hell you
want and that's fine so obviously you
didn't watch even it's 30 seconds into
the video cuz I was you would have known
that and saw that this was a completely
pointless comment thank you hello my
name is Eleni a commented can you please
have tactical vest well your comm is
talking too fast so girl fix yourself
before you fix me kira s she is so
annoying for some reason her bids keep
automatically playing after the ones i
actually want to watch and it instantly
ruins my day okay um first of all my
videos do not should keep playing after
anyone else's videos otherwise i would
be the most popular channel on youtube
so i can guarantee that's not happening
so you must be watching some of my
videos for my videos to constantly
popping up after the videos you watch
because my videos usually only pop up
after the ones that play of myself
so therefore if it is only ruins your
day why you watch for my videos go it's
not that hard to click an x okay it
gives you like 30 seconds to click
something else or get off the page
before it starts on my
playing the next video so unless you're
fond asleep and then I pop up that's
your own fault clay our Kristofferson
has a very very insightful comment that
I want to share with you because I
thought you all should know this about
me okay here we go
I never want to slap a anyone as hard as
I want to slap you you act like you were
the queen of underwear I am the queen of
underwear hi but you're like 12 and
don't know you talk like people can't
wear what they want when they want in it
sleeping with a lot of people does not
make you a please educate yourself
 days and you are not cool because
you have a couple of thongs from
Victoria's Secret and what the hell do
you talk so fake Jesus I cannot deal
with your immaturity
76 thumbs up that's sad I feel sad for
people who thumbs that up because you do
not know me
okay let's we're gonna decipher this
code we're going to go through it piece
by piece we're gonna sleeves let's get
started okay you never wanted to slap a
anyone as hard as I once top you don't
slap me girl I wasn't doing anything I
was just trying to help teach little
girls about underwear so if you had a
problem with it don't slap people that's
bad you act like you're the queen of
underwear and you're like 12 and don't
know I'm almost 19 I will be in a
month so before you say that I am 7
years younger than I am why don't you
figure out a few facts about me you talk
like people can't wear what they want
when they want no I was not I was
specifying the different types of rosna
underwear again the video was the
different types of bras underwear not
how to wear the types of bras and
underwear I'm sleeping with loudly but
does not make you a okay um what's
your definition of a then and you
are not cool because you have a couple
of thongs from a Toria secret actually I
have like over a hundred dollars from a
toy secret and no I don't think that
makes me cool in any way that's my
underwear I don't think I'd wear mix
anyone cool and why the hell do you talk
so fake God gave me this voice no other
choice but she used this wise I'm not
going to change my voice to make you
happy so if it sounds fake deal with it
Jesus I cannot deal with your immaturity
I honestly don't think anything was
immature about that video I stated it as
beginning
someone you know a preteen was scared to
talk to their mom or guardian but they
didn't have a mom a guardian that I
would be here to be their sort of
YouTube older sister or YouTube mom I
called myself just to be kind of funny
and help people you know discuss certain
topics like underwear bras um proper
hygiene periods stuff like that I'm here
to talk about that beauty you know
fashion hair and this is a swiss patreon
for fun and I do think I am mature for
my age I don't think I'm immature in any
way I can goof off and I can be funny
but I definitely don't think that video
was immature me being like thisor
underwear you would have been immature
me talking about underwear on the other
hand is not sorry girl but you're done
cheer fly yuria said bitch sorry no we
don't feel like having our boobs out
24/7 so we want to wear sports bras okay
um if you wear a regular bra your boobs
are not out 24/7 I don't know if you
understand what a regular bra is sports
bras are fine and yes did you cover your
boobs but so does any other bra um any
other regular bra covers your boobs not
just a sports all right and do not call
me a bitch Alina Victoria
damn you're annoying who are you to tell
people what they have to wear and what
not
85 comes up Wow um if I'm annoying that
is your opinion and I will accept that
who are you to tell people what they
have to I'm not I'm telling you what the
different types of bras underwear and
how I wear them I'm not saying if you
don't wear like this you were wrong so
why don't you go back to the hardware
video give me a couple more million
views on that and then learn what I'm
actually trying to get across through
that video tell me o guru Jesus Christ
speak slower okay first of all don't say
Jesus Christ like that is not nice
second of all if you can't spell Jesus
that's that's just an entire problem on
its own joejoebee you think you know
everything but you don't also you talk
white confessed all these comments think
that I think that I know everything and
I don't think I know everything I think
there's a lot to learn still but I'm
sharing the things that I do know and um
that's all I have to say about ray-ray
hard so too can you talk any faster yes
I can Gabriela is knowledge you are way
too much makeup in a dozing even match
it is there okay is there an exact
amount of makeup that each person should
works I would love to see where it says
that but I don't think there's a maximum
how much makeup someone can actually
wear no but thank you for your concern
Alexis Shah is it me or it isn't
foundation math her neck and face better
whoa
I do I don't even know hey I don't even
know what this comment saying is it me
or it the or if it isn't foundation math
her neck and face better I can tell her
this is a rude comment but it cannot
really decipher what it's trying to say
moroni kah rosu 404 when she does like
face it scares me now if you look at the
time on this video at 404 it's me
smiling
I could see if it was any other piece I
was doing but that's my natural smile
rude Kelly bloom little girl you as
skinny as so stop trying to work out
into our cause you don't have a butt
okay stop trying to work out into work
because you don't have a butt okay okay
just because someone doesn't have a but
not mean they cannot twerk and have fun
and it does not mean that they can't
work out first of all in the
expectations vs. reality of being a
teenager I never twerked okay so maybe
watch a video of what's working is
because I did not do it in that video
and the working out was obviously not
real working out I was joking around
working out it to get in shape and feel
good physically and mentally and not to
try to be skinnier than I am that's what
I believe so um I just think this
comments very rude and unnecessary
you're at s oh we got another one from
this girl oh so were you trying to be
like relatable funny you're so annoying
and such a bitch there's no reason you
get so much hate oh that's so so mean I
can't believe you said that about me
actually I can because you're an
internet troll who was nothing better to
do than sit behind a computer and write
immature and senseless things on
people's youtubes we're actually doing
something with their life other than
comforting everything some people's
videos now girl I'm not sure to be mean
to you
okay I care about you I'll help you
doing okay but you're gonna come with
this on mind I will come back at you I
hope you find something better do with
your time please because I understand
maybe you had a bad day and you want to
take it out on someone so thank God it
was on someone who is confident and
happy and secured yourself like me so I
wouldn't actually be very upset about
this at all but good try because you do
know me better than I know myself
Kirra ask Taylor Renee I can't get
through any of your videos desert that
so annoying
well you can't get through any of my
videos so it already looks like you've
clicked on more than one video okay and
that's fine Taylor Renee leave I don't
need you here if you're going to be mean
if I'm really that
then don't watch my videos Sara and
Nicole your bitch seriously you're like
you can't just put concealer under your
eyes in ru formation it has to me ad go
ahead and put this is a video that video
I don't care I think your segments okay
for me to put this and I hate responding
video so thank you for your permission
but um yeah I was saying that your
consumer should go to V form because it
highlights your face better and it looks
like the concealer is not there rather
than if you want to put it into you
that's awesome but then everyone around
you is gonna know that oh she's trying
to hide something with that new
formation concealer but do you girl
again I'm not trying to tell you what to
do I'm just trying to help so if you
don't want to listen it's totally up to
you I don't listen to something's beauty
group say I do it my own way and then I
learned the hard way later that it was
wrong Evelina Reza Matty stop bashing
all my fav products you ass bitch
the makeup doesn't work on you because
you have bad skin and a keychain you
capable of them goes up okay let's start
off with stop bashing all my favorite
products um I had to say this in a video
because I knew some immature person like
yourself would come on here and say
something like this I said the beginning
of all my products that we're going
buying videos if you do not like these
products that's totally okay I like
products that some people with hate that
did not mean that I hate you I have
anything against you
etc just because I had a bad experience
with these products don't mean anything
against you if you like that obviously
this common sense I don't know why
anyone would think otherwise
but I declare for myself so I wouldn't
get a comment like this get I still got
a comment like they take these products
work for you or you love them that's
awesome and I'm glad you got your
money's worth but they didn't work for
me Parts I love my not work for you and
doesn't offend me I'm not saying
anything rude towards you if you like
them as awesome I love you but I just
don't like these products
you es bitch anyone who knows me
who actually knows me can guarantee I'm
not as
as butch but if you want to think that
that's fine it's your own opinion right
and we're all entitled to one freedom of
speech the makeup doesn't work on you
because you have bad skin this is really
hard for me because my family is of
Norwegian descent so we do have red
undertones but I work it work it Oh
glitter poop oh this should be good God
you could just tell she's that popular
dumb bitch at school annoying I actually
think you so much for thinking I was a
popular dumb bitch but I got a 4.0 I had
about 4 good friends and um you have
life to say about that I got good grades
that was what was important to me and
that's what helped me get to where I am
today in college I hope you're doing the
same with your life glitter poop and the
last one I'm going to read today is
