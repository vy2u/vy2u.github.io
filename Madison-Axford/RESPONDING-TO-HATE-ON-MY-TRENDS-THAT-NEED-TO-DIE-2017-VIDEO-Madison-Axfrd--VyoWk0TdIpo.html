don't have to do this video I don't need
to do this video but I feel that it's
necessary that my voice is heard because
it has been silenced for a little bit
too long
my trends that need to dodge 2017 video
a video that it's seemingly a trend
because so many youtubers including
myself have done it a satirical comical
video about trend fashion makeup or
lifestyle choices that we believe should
diminish or quiet down in the upcoming
year 2017 in no way do you have to
follow or abide by these things for what
I say is that the Bible I'm not speaking
words from the Constitution when I say I
don't like I rather a scarf but I am
saying in my personal opinion and
believe on the trend a fashion or makeup
item not a person I would never judge
such a person but I might have an
opinion or judgment on a trend then not
linked to any certain person's
personality morals beliefs
background education or anything of the
such I'm specifically in solely talking
about a trend that I don't like I can't
apologize for that be unapologetic live
unapologetically I'm letting diminish or
hurt someone or make them fear for their
lives there's so much controversy
surrounding my trends video so thank you
for anyone who has watched it liked it
or for that matter hated it because
anyway you're still giving me some sort
of recognition which I'm sure you won't
want me to have but you are so I thank
you for that but you cannot claim the
same offense as you can be a bitch or a
steamer or a slut or a whore or a hoe or
whatever any thing I want with eyebrows
because that's not the same thing
comparing a discrimination against a
person to a statement on an eyebrow
trend or a iPhone case is not the same
so learn it I would never determine it
against a human being
I would never personally attack anyone
on the internet or in real life you just
want to say that you hate people who
wear fake eyelashes and who wear orange
powder or who wear cool shoulder tops
that's fine that's not a discriminatory
remark against me so I can't paint great
offense to that and gets so super
sensitive because it's a generalized
statement whatever talking about our
trends so when I would say that things
are unclassy or ratchet or trashy I'm
talking about a pair of shoes I'm not
going about you I don't like
those things I've every right to say
what I think about them I've seen it
personally some of those things or
ratchet or unclassy or whatever that's
why I chose not to wear them anymore why
I think they shouldn't be worn but that
doesn't mean that what I say has to be
followed if you wear it rocket but
family you need my opinion or my advice
for you to wear something never would I
ever call a person those things though
me saying shoes or phone case is trashy
or ratchet and doesn't mean that a
person carrying it is but I don't know
maybe you weren't understanding because
you're judging how I book so you're not
going to hear when I say because what
I'm saying is not anything about the
person wearing the trend but your to put
to judge that is a lot more about your
character than it could ever about mine
so let's just recall that video I know I
spent over two minutes in the beginning
of the video clarifying why I was doing
this video I've seen a million of these
videos which was true this is satirical
and comical attempt supposed to hurt any
with feelings which was true I realized
that we can step on some people's toes
the people are going to get offended
even though it should have because I'm
talking about a trend another human
being so many people want to point out
in the comments that I instantly comment
from that video because I don't want
anyone's opinion no I love to look
opinions and what people tell me I'm
gonna make us ratchet because actually
then I can learn from that and fix it
and I accept those kind of opinions okay
you say make us two orange eyelashes a
ratchet and fake that's fine thank you
for that but what I don't accept is
constant constant constant bullying
extreme harassment and extreme verbal
attacks that is when I disable the
comments because I don't need the
product I don't need to see that anymore
in my comments section isn't going to be
a mostly positive place for my other
viewers subscribers and commenters to
see I still want it on there and people
come in raving like I thought your
channel is about being positive and
maybe just coming to diva it is because
being a series of comedy that is
something I always have and always will
promote and respect on this channel that
doesn't mean that I can't have personal
dislikes in this world just because I
want to be fierce and Ramona that my
followers doesn't mean that I have to
adore and preach about Instagram
eyebrows or burberry scarf that is not
what that means that means I can have an
opinion and I can share it even if it's
not follow the most people on the
internet or on social media it doesn't
mean that I should be silenced I want
nothing more than to see my young
viewers boys and girls alike okay to
grow up and be successful of being
themselves be happy and be respectful of
they're human beings they can say that
they don't like certain things because
that's what is disliked in a human is
and I hope now my college would
personally do more like any other human
being or make them feel lesser of
themselves or that they're not worth
their life may say I don't like around
in my opinion on an eyebrow trend that
doesn't mean I think you are ugly or
you're worthless or you're unintelligent
or anything of this such think about
that this is what is important because I
know it's going to be will be like you
did this you did that you cyber but I
did not cyber bully I know what cyber
bullying is and I will never ever do
that cyber bullying is the intentional
harassment intimidation and or harm done
to a single human being and while I'm
super strong and amazingly confident
within myself in my life the next person
that you just like leave a hate comment
on their Instagram Twitter YouTube
channel whatever may not be as strong do
you ever think about that
different thing about that thing might
be weight they might be going through
some shit they may have some illness
that makes them not strong enough to
handle but you are throwing at them and
discriminating them and bullying them
with and although there's no permanent
loss right now that lead to conviction
and prosecution and criminalization of
people who do say these things unless of
course to a commit suicide attention has
to be the case someone's not have to die
or harm themselves for someone who's
sane disgusting things to be
criminalized think about what you're
saying is the next person you decide to
attack whether it's consciously or
subconsciously know that you're
disgusting verbiage will and does have
its consequences what you say doesn't
affect me okay but what I do give a damn
about is is that this could hurt other
people it wasn't there reading it about
me or there's everything about
themselves something she's not happened
to them in their life whether that's
death or whatever for you to be punished
in a court of law for that and will
never stop working to to push forward to
create a law that does prosecute and
convict cyber bullies and punish them
correctly for their disgusting behaviors
42% of teenagers are cyber bullying and
one of every ten people who are cyber
bullying commits or attempts suicide and
then if something people are not singing
just because it's not happening in your
town or in your life or your
I'm doesn't mean that it's not happening
to people in this world saying you don't
like thumbs eyebrows okay
whatever that's a comic that is a
statement but saying in targeting a
specific person and everything they are
in stand for in this light in this world
on this earth is a bully this should be
the norm that we're facing we shouldn't
do it oh what's the internet so you're
going to have that no don't even try to
say oh well he'll be shocked if you
shared your opinion and you get feedback
in you're being rude I was a new route I
was sharing my opinion and started to
you thought that was rude but that's
your personal deal I watched these
videos all the freakin times they're
hilarious that's what they're meant to
be and he will say it's not very cold
shoulder top they look trashy I'm going
to wear that because they stopped
wearing long shot lately us bags to
school or out and about because they was
cheap and they look like stereotypical
I'm still going to wear them people say
being that crisscross like tops that you
wear to parties or trashy I'm still
gonna wear that because I'm confident
and I know what I like so doing eyebrows
where I rather like foam pieces that
flip without this focuses as a flip but
don't act like I'm some bully for saying
I didn't like it oh and if you think
you've hurt my feelings you couldn't be
farther from the truth because of
anything I really didn't know I could
get stronger or more confident you made
me realize that can be that and you made
me such a thicker skin and you empowered
me to stick up for what I believe in and
what I don't like even more thing it's
so much for watching some amazing day
I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
