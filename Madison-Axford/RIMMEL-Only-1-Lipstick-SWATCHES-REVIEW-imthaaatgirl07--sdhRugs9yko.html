super exciting video that I've never
really done before yeah I haven't done
this on my channel before and it's um I
have the new line of Rimmel lipsticks
that were just launched or recently
launched or whatever it's the only one
lipsticks that's what they're called or
the only one lipstick they're not liquid
lipsticks not glosses they're not stains
they're not liners there's just
classical lipsticks lipsticks which I
adore cuz I only wear really just
lipsticks I don't really like stains
that much but there are tiny colors I
have them all I'm super excited to talk
to you about them today we're talking
about my lips tell you what I like with
them and stuff like that so without
further ado let's get started so I'm
gonna start the one that I have on my
lips it's the darkest one I love it
umm it's very different for me because I
don't wear super dark shades but it's
called oh so wicked number eight twenty
in the line again the only one lipstick
the only negative thing I have to say
really about these lipsticks during my
first application of one is that it's a
little hard they're just like a lipstick
lipstick but they're so pigmented and
shade that I wish there was a little
like you know how like MAC lipsticks
have like a point to them I wish it was
a little more pointy so I could like
kind of draw my lips because I don't
have lip liners that match hardly any of
these colors if any and so it was a
little tricky my lips are a little
ratchet because it's a little tricky to
draw just on perfectly but I'm bad with
just a normal shoot lipstick so I do
wish the only thing they do is I wish it
was a little point here but that little
minor detail put aside I do love the
formula of them they're not too sticky
but they do have a lipstick feel to them
they don't dry they don't matte they
don't stain they're easy to move around
it's not like once you put it on it
stains you know I hate I just keep
saying stain but I hate stains but um
yes so I really enjoy these this again
is oh so wicked that I helped on my lips
right now and I'm just gonna swatch each
one and tell you the color and guess my
general opinions like I said are just I
really do like the formula it's easy
they're easy to wipe off throughout the
day so yes you will have to reapply but
that's cuz it's a lipstick formula I am
really impressed by rimless stepping up
their game because Rimmel I feel like
this often times have forgotten brand I
usually don't run to them when I'm at a
store because I don't use many products
by them but these lipsticks have stepped
it up towards like L'Oreal Maybelline
and Revlon like quality lipsticks so I'm
very very impressed with the one that
I've had so far and we'll see the other
color
the Sheerness the pigmentation and stuff
like that when I'm putting them on my
lips so I'm gonna zoom you in a little
so that you can see my lips up close and
personal it is a very dark plum purple
almost black undertones I really do like
it perfect for fall and winter I think
it's beautiful it's a beautiful shade I
was most excited to try this because
unlike anything I own I really really
really love this shade so yes
oh so wicked okay the next shade I'm
going to use is number 200 it's a keeper
so it looks like kind of a mozzie pink
shade kind of like darker Mac angel I'm
with a lot of mommy and tan undertones
so let's put this on I'm loving the
shade what I noticed this time around
application wise and they go on so
smooth oh my god like they are super
super waxy jelly and ready to just apply
it onto your lips um I really do love
this it looks kind of like a little bit
of a darker Mac angel I just can't
believe how smooth and like comfortable
it is to wear this it doesn't feel thick
or um like Matt I really enjoyed this
color holy crab um it does have those
them mauve undertones of a kind of baby
pink classic lipstick so it's a keeper
is the keeper I really enjoyed this when
I put it on I didn't think I would but I
won't lose color the next shade is 5 10
best of the best this looks like a
beautiful red color which Rimmel is the
only Reds I will use really I have Ruby
woo by Mac yes but I love Rimmel's red
lipsticks are so true to color they're
not like red orange red pink red mauve
red maroon no they are red red this
collection can we just take minute has
every possible color ones it's Salmons
red burnt red umm Pink's light Pink's
hot pinks Brown a purple mauve like I
love this collection so anyway moving on
with red 5 10 best of the best
let's see if it's true it's harder to
put on um these are crochets because
they're so pigmented that I'm like when
I slept on the side with myself I am
doing this kind of fast so don't hate on
me for my ratchet
lipstick application technique um yeah
this is the purse
ready look at it i rapidly draw my lips
i mean they look awful but the color is
beautiful i can't stop looking at the
viewfinder sorry but like I love it I
love the shininess of it and it's not
sure at all if these are payment ADIZ
lipsticks came to play these did not
come as a little sheer tint this came as
the main star of the show next we have
in orange like a true orange 620 call me
crazy because the Scala is variety I
love orange lipstick i sweet super and
orange and purple two summers ago I kind
of pulled back because I was just living
for pink but I have done orange before
and it is fun I love it I love these
lipsticks I think I just love the
formula they're so smooth and easy to
move around if you mess up the like
drawing of the lip I just love this
color
next we have number 790 nude and this is
like a perfect just nude mauve color it
does have purple undertones as you can
see and brown around what brown
undertone so I don't have a lot of
colors like this but this looks like
colors on my mom often where she loves
these kind of shades like these nude
shades nude brown so let's see what this
is like oh this formula it's so buttery
oh it's so buttery
I really didn't mean to I know you guys
like if I don't like maybe like and then
every lipstick because that's kind of
annoying I have not been disappointed
yet I wouldn't really call this naughty
nude I wouldn't call it nude I would
call it like mauve or kind of it has a
lot of purple pink undertones I love it
wow I really do it's getting so red
around my mouth from the taking of
lipsticks up next we have the hottest
pink of life it's 110 pink punch look at
this guys I can't I cannot any deep
breath okay let's do it it looks like um
Viva Glam Nicki Minaj okay the quality
of these superb the color I'm not a huge
fan of just like I think I said I regret
buying diva glam because it's beautiful
yes but so hard to wear I have right
here it's a beautiful color it is but
it's so hard to wear that I'm about like
like this like people
girl go back to Nicki Minaj concert next
we have 810 one-of-a-kind and this is
like a very dark red like not a bright
red without a classic red like a brown
undertone red lipstick again such a dark
color application is hard but I love it
it looks like and I like the color of ox
blood and I really do enjoy this kind of
maroon not even maroon though I don't
know what color I would describe this as
just dark dark red like blood almost and
I don't know I think it's very pretty
next week 120 you're all mine and it
looks like kind of Mac angel again like
I know I was comparing them to that but
that's cuz it's like the only thing I
use but a little bit brighter hotter of
a pink then dull light baby pink Mac
angel so yes you're all mine ah it can't
win with them all this to me looks kind
of very very very similar to one I did
two shades ago I mean they look
extremely different in the case but like
pink a punch the hot pink one looks
exactly like this one in my opinion is
it just me maybe it's pretty no it is a
little less in-your-face hot pink but
like I do like it I can see okay no no
no I scratch that I do see myself
wearing this more than the bigger punch
hot pink one however this one still is a
little too big for my liking personally
I think it's beautiful color
I don't know how when I went but I know
I would wear a lot more often than the
other one
next we have a salmon shade 600 peachy
beachy oh that's cute this from the
outside color looks like just a nice
peachy salmon color um and it looks
salmon here too let's see
uh-oh it's not really salmon it's more
coral because salmon has a lot more
orange in it which I assumed from this
orangie looking up outer little color
swatch thing um I like it don't see
myself wearing that much okay because
these hot bright pink stones go super
well my skin tone so I always go for it
Mac a little taller and we only have one
more in the collection oh my god we've
come so far
it's 610 cheeky Coral bitch we got
another quarreling this looks not like
coral looks they don't have a salmon one
I wish they had a more salmon e-1 this
looks a lot better in red orange almost
rather than a coral but it is cheeky
poreless it looks like
that's why no my god okay um it's a lot
more bright of a color they're talking
about this one that I like a little more
could see myself wearing it as much as
others know but more than the last one
because that one was a little too
something I don't know I kind of like a
place moving around it but this one yes
it's a very very bright payment to neon
almost but there's something more true
about this this coral color um how'd you
like it I just I just don't see myself
wearing this like a business meeting you
know what I mean and I know like these
aren't like business lipsticks but what
I do is school and work and I can see a
lot of these perfect for that but some
shades are more I guess just fun in your
face and I wouldn't personally pick them
up again overall I liked about seven of
them I would say definitely if you're
gonna do anything just check out and
swatch some of these for yourself these
the only one lipstick by Rimmel yes I'm
gonna be enjoying this lip swatch video
