supplies that i got for college for the
2014-2015 school year this will probably
on the laxity a semester well like the
folders and notebooks but everything
else I should be good on so let's hop
right into the video the first thing i
got is in the necessary i felt like for
college life and it's just a pair of
scissors these are nice scotch good like
durable scissors that are super cute
leave with pattern but they're adorable
the blue obviously um and I just really
really like these and Mackenzie got
matching ones well she heard a pink my
roommate but I happen to don't know why
but I did i just really like them i
think they're cute and I mean Izzy so
much so definitely get scissors if you
are going to college you're gonna need
them then I got the target brand
highlighters they're so cute colorful
and I love them they work very well I'm
a few times already I love the colors
and yeah it's such a variety and I got
double this so I got six and then
another six they like two of each color
and one pack and they're very rare
achieve with three bucks so you gonna
need highlighters definitely I'm sorry
this is like all kind of like out of its
package but i got these mechanical
pencils by vic um they aren't necessary
for me because i have to do a math class
obviously so i have to write in pencil
this is going down to castigate get emma
shucks it's like college do you know i
mean anyway then I got a number two
wooden pencils for like scantron tests I
got a mini state lurks I'm going to need
this for when I have to write essays and
staple papers and stuff like in my room
I got a 300 pack of flashcards I never
know what I'm going to need these for
math or psyche or whatever I got some
Scotch little tape um some Elmer's
school glue and a pencil sharpener also
for my room but I felt I got my need
from a project or
I need to show up in their pen solos now
you have these awesome pens buy a paper
mate and are called ink joy there's more
colors that can find them and I'm Way
too lazy to search through my backpack
because my backpacks already a mess but
they write amazingly so smoothly and to
commit such a variety of colors I love
colorful stuff highlighters pens markers
whatever so yeah I got these pens for my
pin choice like my mom was always like
pick up some pens you want I get a
different every year and this year I
picked out these papermate ones then I
stayed really simple for my school
supplies this year I just got some black
folders I got five for each one of my
classes I got um five huge like five
star notebooks i love 5 star notebooks
and they work very well so I knew I DHT
a lot of notes and get big notebooks so
that's what I got for my classes and
then the last I gots my favorite thing
it's my lilly pulitzer agenda that's
literally bigger than like five of my
head's combined um I got the largest
size i think it's called big extra large
and i joined us print either comment
down below if you know what this is but
it's a huge planner agenda whatever you
want to call it for the school year of
2014-2015 because i want to be really
organized and keep all my events and
only homework assignments and tests and
upcoming things that I need to do down
in my planner gasps oh that's all I got
and then my backpack which is kind of
looking at your neck so open it's just a
swissgear backpack that's of a plain
black from target it's very very durable
and I thought would be great to carry a
backpack rather than a shoulder bag just
wouldn't hurt my shoulder but back i'm
