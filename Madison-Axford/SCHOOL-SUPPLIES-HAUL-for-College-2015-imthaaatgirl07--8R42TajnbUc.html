back-to-school supplies haul for my
second year in college my sophomore year
as a college student so I thought what
better outfit then I sub in shirt
company sharks is all people wear
college right no not true this is a
college like shirt so I thought to put
it on for it in the video being a
college student you don't get that many
school supplies and this might be weird
because it's like a two second video you
know but at least for me I don't need
that much most of the work is done on a
computer to be honest so really you just
got to get a nice computer and you're
pretty much set for the whole year maybe
a pencil here and there so first thing
is I bought this a while back but it's
just a white Victoria Secret if you can
read that this is for a secret pencil
pouch makeup holder you know it's a
makeup case but we're guessing pencil
pouch and I have all the pens and
pencils that I'm gonna be using for the
year in it already
the only pencils I like to use for the
most part are mechanical I feel like a
lot of people are like this who really
loves using number two wooden pencils
anymore maybe you do I just don't really
like them because we seem to break on me
I can never get them sharpened right and
all this stuff I got from Target
otherwise I'll specify if it's from
somewhere else like for choice you good
then I free highlighters I got like five
thousand last year I didn't need them at
all
so just yellow orange pink sharpie
highlighters they're like the thick ones
and I hide a lot like a lot then I just
have 812 gel pens look at use they're
fun I got them from Target as well it's
like a pack of 24 23 25 I don't know no
it would not be a pattern 23 so I don't
know if this 24 25 but they were like
$12 just for every hole you could
imagine it even black and blue they have
and all the crazy rainbow colors silver
sparkly some are matte gel pens and that
is just all inside my inventory secret
pence pouch makeup case the next thing I
got from Le Blitzer via shop which is
called pink Magnolia the one in st.
Louis anyway it's my let's plan our
Santa plan our agenda thing and last
year I got the extra large size it was
great but it's 25 extra pounds in my
backpack I got the large size which you
can see is very smaller than the other
one the other ones like the side it's
like a notebook really but I love this
and it has just as much writing space
like it didn't lower the right place it
all yourself like each day has like oh
here's one day it's like that big not
much space you can write it for one day
so this goes from obviously
fifteen is here to December 2016 you
open it like look how beautiful this is
and it's like folder a check and you
have a little notes or anything and then
I have stickers like I hope Lily puts
their planner see the only kind of
agenda I would get I just love like
wizard planners are so colorful and they
make you wanna do your homework and get
stuff done you know and I love looking
at it and I can't live that planner like
this has my entire life written down
school or not school YouTube we're not
YouTube everything will be written down
that happens to me in here I usually
take a lot of notes write handwritten
because they help me memorize and study
better so she's got a five subject five
star notebook in it they have these
little folders tabs and then paper so I
always go overboard by five notebooks 5
folder speech class assignment but I
noticed that I don't write that much or
I'll write a lot of stuff or do a lot of
homework online so I think this should
be enough paper for each class like if I
am in a history class for an English
class where writing is more prevalent
than other classes I will get next your
notebook if I do run out but this has
five separate sections of paper with
divided by tabs for five different
subjects which I have five classes so
that is it I got the turquoise one I
thought was the prettiest the last thing
I got is I've never done this before
I've never done an expanding file folder
I can my friend Mackenzie has everyone
has done it except me I've always gotten
separate folders or like a big binder
but I'm not into binders right now
and I did I had five folders in my cart
and then I was like I took them out and
I was like I really want to do an
expanding file folder and I found the
cutest whenever a leopard print one it's
beautiful it's my rants did you see
again target had it so you just open it
like this and then it gives you like
literally 510 tabs and you can seal
sticker so you can mark the tabs with
and in expanse pants the hanging file
folder you can put all your papers in
foil your classes so I'll only really
like five but I could also put receipts
paycheck stubs stuff like that in here
to keep myself and my whole life
organized so I got this it was about to
eight dollars and this notebook was
eight dollars
stuff sixteen bucks that's all school
supplies I got and very happy with what
I have but really I don't want to go
overboard I always get overboard and get
like markers and crayons index cards I'm
like I'm not gonna use this like I still
have scissors which is very important in
tape from last year definitely get those
maybe a pencil sharpener and stapler I
recommend those for college students I
have a little
left over I didn't use it all up but
other than that I just got some new
things to organize myself take notes
bear pencil patch with my necessities in
it so I hope you enjoyed this quick
little video I'm telling you what you
need for college and what I got if
you're not raising them to subscribe to
my channel and become my fierce and
confident do you like me and the rest of
us on here and check back later for new
videos I post new videos quite often
thank you so much for watching bye
