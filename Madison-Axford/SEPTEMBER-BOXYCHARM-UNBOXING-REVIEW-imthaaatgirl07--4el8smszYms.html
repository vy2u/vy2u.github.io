every time it's my favorite boxing
company monthly boxing subscription box

product and holy crap it's the greatest
thing ever I'm so excited I get this
dislike you get like Christmas and
birthday presents every month so let's
open this baby up ah sorry his little
card that i read the products off of and
there's actually six this month holy
crap it's like a mini bit bonus travel

your hands then gently massage in a
circular motion on to face and down your
neck this is face lotion higher english
guys can use it anywhere okay cool good
to know you keys on your face my hands
are always dry and so as the rest of my
skin so let's just try a little bit of
this out it'd be nice to have a really
good expensive high-quality lotion hydro
milk by pre vice ok let's try to silence
makes my skin smooth oh ah it's also bad
it smells like like a really really like
20 * hotel this is when i stayed at one
time and it was like I'm not trying to
brag right as I selling bitch but like
that's what I'm saying I'm just saying I
stated a freaking nice hotel of some
time call the four seasons I'm downtown
st. Louis it's the most amazing which
I'll bring this would it smells like
this just like relax to me um I wouldn't
say my hands feel like amazingly soft
now but it has to maybe does something
like you repeatedly use it fifty dollars
as much like a naked palette it's better
do something amazing next we have vasani
professional foundation brush okay
um I actually don't have a foundation
brush like this which is really
surprising and nice I always apply a
Beauty Blender I always apply my
foundation Beauty Blender but we'll try
this sometime now specially shaped and
decided create flawless even a
natural-looking foundation application
originally $32 from the Sun vasanti i'm
going to race off for sure like the
bristles and fibers are very soft I just
legs would make the application of
foundation take 10 extra minutes oh I
feel I gonna be so long is that just me
I don't know which I it will try it I'm
just a total media under girl okay next
we would tart product which is a main
main main main main stream high-end
product which is crazy and that's in
here cuz usually they promote unknown
brands and they're all great things and
great brands it's just like I've heard
of things and tardis obviously one on
brand so I'm like wow original $20
motorized Amazonian clay waterproof
liner and this is in the shade gold the
gold eyeliner on one side so 00 work yes
that's like freaking 20 karat gold and
then there's a little smudge on the
other side so it's smudge and CEO of
smudges ok ok work as much as quite well
so many great as it's like very wet um
but like it in a good way to apply under
your um like I look at you're doing like
I sometimes apply eyeliner under the
shadows i'll be joining to make them pop
more and give them more like of a stable
like base um and this would be great
because it's like wet and a shadow is
one thing let's come grab onto it but it
wouldn't take away from the color ok
love a good job heart next we had the
cella I bro defining gel uses clear brow
gel to lift holding groom eyebrow hairs
$18 they must have heard me complaining
about how i always get stuff to fill my
eyebrows I never use and they sent me
Joe I do use gel because my eyebrows I
don't pull them in but they need to stay
down because they need to stay in their
blaze so it's by the branch Ella I
already have a lot on my brow social one
up to you they're like stiff right here
from me gluing them down to shaped so
I'll try this but I know how well it
will work that's already have some on um
okay how much is this really
20 no 18 bucks okay yeah is it black no
okay that's good man throws that goes
like okay I ok it's just like any other
one like if I'm gonna be honest it's
just like elf and it's just like
Maybelline I mean I like it it works
amazing I'm so that I have this tube now
I can't wait this is a full size though
but I'm not complaining um but it was do
anything different it is a really big
brush and I have big eyebrows so we'll
be fine but someone was more thin of an
eyebrow shape this might be a little too
big you might get gel like above and
below the brow okay like this locus
perfect for me but I wouldn't stand
eighteen dollars on it personally no
offense I'm next bit of scratched nail
wraps which I I'm sorry I don't like
meals anything about nails they don't
like me I applause you're going no raps
I do nothing to my nails if I do do
something to my nails it'll be acrylics
at a salon I don't know trying to put
nail wrap salons me I'll give these to
my sister but twelve dollars from
scratch nail wraps get a full man you
with these yeah i was in less than 10
minutes I tried wraps once it didn't
work maybe since my house suck they're
so tiny but I don't you know I don't
like them fun that's just my opinion the
last thing is a Kardashian Kardashian
Kardashian beauty stuff perhaps your
beauty will actually a dry oil travel
sized bonus items so I don't tell the
price because it's a smaller tell size
special boxy charm edition thing a
nutrient-rich treatment in styling aid
that rejuvenates and nourishes hair so
it appears strong thick smooth
inglourious of shiny okay this from a
hat I take a shot every day I know can
be bad for your hair controversial
whatever but my hair gets so greasy not
gonna lie not trying to hide that
there's a fact about me a hair gets
really great see very easily i don't
know cuz i run my fingers through a lot
I don't know literally I get out of the
shower and I already not joking that
turn a funny alright already have to
spray dried should put my hair by the
time I hair dries because just like
greasy I don't know if it's good young
hormones whatever it's disgusting but it
happens my hair's not dirty it's just
greasy and really shiny and yeah so i
don't know i love Kardashian beauty
brand but i don't know how i'll be using
this cuz I don't need my hair to get any
more shiny than it really is but you
