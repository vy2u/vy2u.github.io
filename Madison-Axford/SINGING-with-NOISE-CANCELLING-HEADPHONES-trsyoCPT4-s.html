something I'll probably regret doing to
be honest it's - singing with noise
cancelling headphones challenge I got so
many recommendations to do this I know
92 10 ish percent of people hate my
singing I met about two people that
actually appreciate it myself not
included I know that I'm not a singer
I'll ever be a singer in usually I can't
sing so this video is it can be like
listen me think I can say I don't think
I can that's not was it it's going to
sound more but it's nothing ratchet I
like beef so I will be able to hear
I'll have a turnip all the way so I will
literally be seeing probably pretty loud
and often I'll pitch a rhythm
I rest horribly but you know what I'll
be fine so I thought this because it was
recommended I thought she doesn't do it
I love Shane Dawson so much that my only
youtubers i watch so I was inspired by
Hannah like everything just hit shuffle
