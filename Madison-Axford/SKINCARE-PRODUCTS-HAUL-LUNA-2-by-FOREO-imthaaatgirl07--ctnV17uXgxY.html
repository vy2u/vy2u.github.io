requested video a skin care video was
requested and I will get to that
definitely definitely for sure using all
these products i'm showing you today but
today is my skincare like regimen haul
video so all the things that i use or
i'm going to start using or want to try
and stuff like that in the new year um
these are all new products for me and
I'm very excited to share them with you
and then once I hasn't met a little bit
i'll do another video of my skin care
routine including these products if I
likes them for new ones if I did not I'm
very particular with what I put him is
getting sensitive and in the past I was
in particular i just put any gob glue
blah blah bluh whatever I went into on
my skin and I would have reactions to it
and wonder why that was happening and
it's like um maybe because you can't
just put everything you want to on your
skin you know you got to take care of it
got to be careful with it and know what
kinds can you have iowa combination so
it's really dry in certain areas and
then oily a ton in other areas this is
not a skincare routine like I already
said this is a skincare haul video so
I'm going to show you the products I'm
going to be trying within the next few
weeks and then we'll do a skin care
routine but do you want to show you how
I use these products and yes without
further ado let's start it on the main
reason i'm doing this video is because i
got the luna to buy free oh I'm so so so
excited to try this they sell this
online and um at sephora and they are a
little pricey I never bought the
clarisonic at the clearest thing me or
the first link to or whatever the hell
they're called because it was expensive
and I didn't really see great reviews
about it I heard like the brush was
really rough and like all this stuff so
i was like huh I don't know if I wanna
spend that kind of money on the face
brush that doesn't have amazing reviews
but this one which is the luna to like
we said bye for Rio is 199 I think it is
and I heard so many great reviews though
this because I wasn't harsh on the skin
it's like the key thing I was looking
for because my skin can get it's ready
red but it can't get a lot redder and I
just felt like a really firm and stiff
brush wouldn't be the right choice for
me so that's why I chose not to go with
the clarisonic but apparently the fry oh
does um the same thing basically get
it's so soft and it's like a rubber
silicone brush head and it has the
different levels of vibration right here
in the great thing about this is you
don't charge all the time it works like
450 times and you don't need to charge
it every day like the clear sign my mom
is a clarisonic and she does like it but
I mean you got charged that a lot and
look at this acute little blood and it's
like so I don't know I'm just so excited
try this this is a new and upcoming
thing it came from Sweden but it's an
all supporters now and I always saw it I
was like I need that and I don't know
it's just like everyone has they sound
so I was like okay I gotta get this I
mean should I research this and made
sure i could get off you know makeup and
it wouldn't ruin this and nothing can
ruin this like you don't have to a ver
ever replace this it's silicone so it
just washes off where again the
clarisonic like that silicone so you got
to constantly be like watching to make
sure your brush doesn't get all dirty
and this isn't a big rag on clarisonic
video but i was just comparing the two
exciting you i wanted to face face
cleanser washer brush thing and I know
which one to pick and this one just had
so many more benefits i felt so i went
with this one we have different brush
heads for different skin types so oily
normal combination sensitive and I got
combination i think it was and the blue
one and i don't know there's just thing
about this that just seemed more like
personable like I know it's a brush but
it just seemed like it was more
individualized to each person like it's
not just like oh yeah I want to go get
the Luna to from pro and you know what I
want no there's like different colors
and there's different heads for your
skin type in like all this stuff so I
tried this yet but I'm super excited to
as you couldn't tell already and like I
didn't mean to make this like a freaking
QVC commercial but I'm just really
excited I think you guys should check
this out you know you don't buy a but at
least check it out and get a chance and
compared to others you know brushes and
face cleansers on the market right now
because this is a new upcoming one and
i'm really glad i got this so it's a
little egg and i'm excited to try this
and hopefully this will be in my
upcoming skincare routine now i'm going
to show you the other skincare products
that i have bought quickly they were all
from Target actually the first thing I
got is like my general cleaner but this
is the new neutrogena rapid clear
stubborn acne cleanser with benzoyl
peroxide I usually don't like benzoyl
peroxide I usually like to go a
salicylic acid because it helps clear my
acne a lot faster than this cuz
salicylic acid dries up your acne
whereas this is just like a thick white
face and if you can see that
it doesn't clean up and dry up the acne
as fast as on my scan there's ten
percent benzoyl peroxide in this which
is acne medication like I said I like
salsa acid better for my expectation but
whatever this was new and I wanted to
try it I love Neutrogena face stuff but
I've tried almost everything by them so
I was like oh let me try this new thing
because stuff has worked for me the past
but not amazingly so I mean I've always
had acne and I'm never fun I think that
just like washes it all the way but I'm
excited to try this so yeah go check
this out then i got i always use
neutrogena toner or like the target
brand but i was like oh my god gardenia
and came out with a micellar i don't
know if i'm saying that right cleansing
water yeah I feel like this is like a
knock knock knock knock knock off
bioderma but still could be amazing if
you know what i mean so it's by the
brand Garnier skin active and it's also
knew it removes all makeup even
waterproof mascara no oil and no alcohol
no fragrance is basically like a toner
if you don't know what a cleansing water
is it's basically a cat owner and it's
kind of similar to a knockoff bioderma
if you don't know what bioderma is it's
like a really expensive makeup remover
toner kind of stuff like that so yes
this is a bio face cleanser and
surprisingly powerful yet gentle just
skate effectively removes makeup cleanse
the skin and refreshes um so yeah it's
like if you can see that it's kind of
like neutrogena like remover the same
kind of liquid e base i'm really really
excited to try this and then after i
wash my face and stuff and i shall i
make them on or I have some follow or
eyeliner or mascara that came off
because the water and now is under my
eye I will use this oil free eye makeup
remover this is just like the Neutrogena
one except I stayed like three four
dollars it's the new Jeana oil-free eye
makeup remover dupe wishes oil Frederick
remove it from the up-and-up friend at
target um I love love love the new Jeana
I makeup remover it's it feels greasy
but it's not oily there's no toilet
that's the key thing and it removes
everything so easily it's just like one
swipe and it's all gone so I love that I
don't have to scrub like I have had to
with some other eye makeup removers and
you want it to be really really like
gentle and soft and slick around the eye
area so you're not like
pulling and I'll see if it is anything
like or the same as the Neutrogena
oil-free and remover which this claims
to be the dupe for last thing I got from
a skincare is the clean and clear acne
and spot treatment advantage with
salicylic acid i bought this a while ago
though I just want to include this I
have used it you can probably see the
little dent I was using the clean and
clear white wine I forgot what it's
called but has benzoyl peroxide it's
just big white cream that I put all over
my zits and all from my acne and stuff
and it wasn't doing much if anything for
me so this is a clear treatment and in
South cilic acid which I do prefer like
I already said is oil free and so I have
been liking this a lot more because it
dries up the acting so quickly so that
is my skincare hall I hope you enjoyed
that definitely check out good Luna to
buy frail cuz i'm really excited trying
it we can join it together and so the
link is in the downbar for that and all
