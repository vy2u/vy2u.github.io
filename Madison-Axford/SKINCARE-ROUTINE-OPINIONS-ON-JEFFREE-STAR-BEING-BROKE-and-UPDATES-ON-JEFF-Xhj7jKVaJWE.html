talking video I hope you guys like this
because I have been loving doing these
it's something that I'm looking forward
to each day I didn't post a video
yesterday my bad but there's a story
behind that I woke up right and just had
this all fly headaches again it's almost
every day like really almost every day
and didn't even see me what was
happening okay
anyway it was bad like ice legal or the
woke up and just like late on Towson
watch - Gilmore Girls the reunions day
because I was like I don't wanna do
anything I couldn't even like gather any
thoughts to come sit down and talk for
you guys this is kind of like that look
like what was happening I wasn't sick
and just a headache all the freaking
time
yeah so that's what I did yesterday and
this was no video statements gonna be -
today I just uploaded one trend
anitadyer came from 17 in and as well as
this one will go up later tonight I
loved doing that video I love you being
able to talk about fashion something I
haven't done so long and I hope not
takes it too seriously and another thing
to pay your trolls like freak out about
everything but I'm really really like
talking about friends need to die so if
you like bad video give a thumbs up go
watch if you haven't and here's to say
it too and talk about a few things I
would think make it a lick and I'd like
a million and one things what I'm going
to talk about first tiny little box of
some my shares of my recent favorites I
got my pony things
oh my gah my skin is never felt better
it looks better I know you know probably
facility uses here and there but like
the redness the chemical burns are gone
it is so smooth I've been doing this
regiment now for two days to the can
little earlier at came yesterday
so I've done it three times to do it
twice a day so I've done three times
ever want to do tonight but five
products I may read them to you but I'll
show you them now in the flesh and I
just love them the things Clooney I
haven't read much about them I just knew
every when you see who loved to be seen
it's like been around for a while told
you so much my throat is like Fort Davis
oh I didn't go outside and to do much
research I just like watching those
videos of senior scary teens they love
these and I'd bought them but I want
this is a cleansing or what but they're
so soft until like perfect for sensitive
skin they don't hurt my skin I'm like
washing rubbing washing
coming and there it's not hurting our
gang run at all so the first time I got
is Clinic liquid facial soap and mild
these were all like nothing was more
than like $25 I'm like I think it's so
great but I start with and I don't know
if this is the right region air supposed
to use that this is the order I'm going
in so I start with this and I just put
it rub it up like 30 seconds or whatever
actually a nice little soak to get off
any makeup or dirt I have been wearing a
few days then I go in with this clinic
acne solutions cleansing foam so it's a
good cleanser but it has soft web apps
attack narration in it to really get
down on your acne it's not just a face
wash it's now the cleanser and it's
foaming and it kind of smells a little
minty that makes me mean but I was
enjoying that then I go in with this
which I use this more as like a
two-minute mask may and mask
I know so you since um I don't your
anything I just leave it on but I don't
leave it on because it's like it's very
strong like it will create less dry
patchy skin again if I left on too long
when I went from mistake last time stuff
this is clean acne solutions all over
clearing treatment with benzoyl peroxide
so I'm getting selig acid benzoyl
peroxide all this stuff and I know it's
great so this finally is like a writer
dye for people with acne and then we put
it on where they have acne and I wash it
off after like five minutes or so and
yeah so this is again a day and a half
so my going to show us two improvements
my skin's doing really well then
everyone knows this
it's Clinique dramatically different
moisturizing lotion so here we have a
little yellow thing and this is really
really just soft and creamy when I put
it on and when I do put it on I want to
apply it once like with Sarah Bay I love
it I a lot of money in like
rehabilitation to that but I think now I
do reapply reapply reapply reapply for a
minor skin and this is like one and I'm
wanting was at night and I don't have to
right so we can package that all any
more interesting acid on it just a spa
treatments or after I use it and it's a
clean acne solutions clinical clearing
gel with South Pole guesses or just put
this on my trellis off the trimmer
forehead above my lips currently I'm
just right on the acne it seems a little
funny
two seconds literally and then goes away
which is amazing so I've been
doing those like I said it was about 111
or two dollars all those products from
Sephora free shipping because I spent so
much and I don't worry about a penny of
it I love it
- I was going to be liking I hope you
make a fing symptom makeup in so long my
makeup videos but um the first thing I
got in making the beautycon box and if I
am that if you transgressed or mascara
it's usually but this reminds me a lot
of better than sex so it's um with
randos both hello this is L'Oreal why I
don't know L'Oreal Hotel okay L'Oreal
voluminous waterproof the feline lines
with the new with like the little animal
print I really like this because the
brush brush is reminisce or has a brush
per se with a brush application and what
my lashes going after is reminiscent of
better than sex so I've been really
really liking this definitely said if
you have an ID the green one I really
like it's black so it's not great but
it's this I don't know if they another
color too and then I got a lot of
questions about what Jeffrey sour skin
frost highlighter I have I love it
I adore jeffree star I think he stole
that out he's like give a crap attitude
I love him and I have a name King Tut
it's the gold one I put quite a little
bit and the same with this is just
amazing just look you see this of course
you do
love it litter that was one swipe one
swipe it comes much use me other like
all viewers used to applied makeup and I
really like it it's not expensive
computer side cutters or never if it
doesn't mean break $30 so if you're
looking for highlighters definitely one
of these things crazy colors like black
and blue and green and purple but I got
the King had gold one the great great
pick on my personal last thing I love to
talk about in the old book is psycho I
also hate trust the movie I watched it
last night I was like I haven't seen any
like classic movies have get any like
classic or films and so I was looking at
like the top like 100 best open because
my level movies and really wouldn't be
up to par on my like cinema knowledge
and so this is obviously on there ever
in those movies like rank is the top two
for horror movies ever
and this asked me up I was like on edge
on the intimacy the holes and watch this
oh my god
and I know he's not scary but like this
I was like like I love it like if you
over 13 or whatever and you a little
fright to watch this people really like
this that's not scary at all the like
I'm not saying the guy like had
nightmares I don't I don't get scared
stuff like this
well I'm saying goes again it was
looking exciting out of adrenaline scary
thing I was like holy no no no dark no I
was like okay Oh like that but we must
Watson so I really doing that so I would
get a shout out okay we got similar mix
okay can we just happen to anyone else
I was really up nights ago I I hate
people talk about dreams like when I get
news and people like I mean I'm a dream
account game hell I'm going to hell I
will talk about your dream honestly like
I'm sorry I don't care about your dream
if it involves me then it's kind of
funny cool when you talk about it but it
was just like I felt like I was riding a
horse when I needed here but I don't
care no one cares so it seems didn't
happen they're not real anyway um so I
had talked about straight long would I
when I go 7 anyone else so I had a dream
that I was with this purse this guy that
I know you I don't know I heard of it on
my camera I think but um I was like with
him but we've never been women friends
but like in this like we were together I
was nowhere I'm talking like 43 for
years maybe um I recently so weirdly we
were together and I was like happy and 7
we were like a couple and I was like my
phone because it was like what but in
the dream I did not know what I was like
what kind of talking forever I don't
associate with him I'm not friends with
him I just like him at all no no but
like we just don't don't go to college
like me not to like we're not sniffles
and so to just have a random dream about
him and be like a couple was so weird
and random to me and I don't know it was
just like dude I met anyone else like I
don't know my mind or my brain gets
these thoughts when sleeping it's late
let's bring you that person in and have
them be in a relationship like I'll see
if I have until this day I'm like oh no
like what sorry but no so I don't know
why am i doing that it was really weird
really weird
Oh another thing I got though
okay if you don't have to make attack me
exam like you probably would hurt
whether you were to rain on that I got
Chanel number five
oh my god this perfume you either love
it or you hate it
honestly for a nice not that I was like
let me show you thank you it oh because
it's nothing old woman but you gotta get
used to it and so you can get issued on
over 500 day parcel or you can get you
know number five
Oh premier and I guess it'll premiere
and it's a layer more like whiskey your
hand smells was not so pungent and must
be in your face this is like some
probable woman but like a young vocalist
and so I really really like this this is
like what man Alondra war you know
famous perfume it didn't it costs a lot
my total is $150 for this but I did get
the 3.4 flow answers so I think that's a
lot I mean you should I get like one
ounce of perfume so um this I'm sorry I
got because even if you don't like the
smell just like this is a classic
perfumes I love though like what half of
the spray is enough to last you the
whole day and everyone's like whoa
because it's um very interface but I
love that I was having my briefings I
was she's very any paid for food so you
like smell me and you like know who I am
um but it's all this like means so much
to me that I could like okay this is
nothing I don't want to be like I had
money but like I do so it's my own money
I don't use it in the current money for
anything the fact that I can just go to
the store and buy a hundred all perfume
for no reason for a special occasion
is it is not just me being like I can
spend like know what that shows to me
because literally uh okay my senior year
of high school I worked three jobs well
you two being one of them but I do make
money of YouTube so I count that heavily
because it takes time effort and I make
money from it so I three thousand a
senior year I left school early after
four to six hours English to go to work
to these jobs because I was working so
many hours so I was making money but the
thing is it has a spend it'll I didn't
have the saving technique I didn't have
like I don't know I didn't see you there
my money I spend it all the time in this
saddest part
I didn't know what to stop it wasn't
like I had in like an addiction or like
um like another tool shopping meet or
anything it was just that I didn't know
how to save money so we get my paycheck
whatever it was for my three different
jobs and I would go spend it on things I
wanted I wouldn't think like oh maybe I
should take this money maybe I'm one
thing in the future bla bla bla and no I
would just spend it in the saddest part
is my partner my senior year I had to
return I bought my backpack and with
this bag from gap and I had to return it
because I couldn't afford to - higher
starts and OCD so I returned my backpack
so I I had to use a person that had home
- now backpack so I get a four CD it
wasn't like I was poor but I didn't have
any money
um and it's not like open affordance is
like obviously no I still live to my
parents like I got food from you and
whatever and they are materialistic
things granted I kinda need a new
backpack right and I didn't need a
monitor CD but I play the hell out of it
so it was worth it um you know bangers
whatever but I literally had to return
my backpack so it's in a four divide our
CD so I didn't have money now you have
money I my retirement fund set up I have
savings hands like all these accounts
I'm able to buy pretty much anything
that I want for myself which is the most
incredible feeling because I know the
value of a dollar and it's just so
rewarding them it I'm so thankful I've
emma-crats didn't just give me
everything or handing everything because
I do work for what I needed and what I
wanted and I didn't just get handed
or a parent's credit card I do work for
what I wanted and I prove to myself and
I truly need and if I don't need it or I
don't go use it for very long I don't
buy it because it's my own money I
worked my ass off for and they just show
so much so if you're watching this in
your Western sixteen or your Sunday or
whatever and you don't have a job or you
want to get a job doing it get a job go
out there I started the fast food
industry I started in retail I went
online you know I've done a bunch of
 but I'm like making money for
myself and that's listen to how I'm
feeling because you can buy some beers
love you can buy for others that's so
fun for Christmas and birthdays that I
can purchase big things for people big
ticket items that I never could before
because of money that I worked for is
just so incredible so definitely get out
there get a job be independent do
something with your time don't waste it
make money for yourself and it's just
soul
I don't know riveting almost it's just
an amazing feeling especially me because
I was broke as hell my senior year and
going into college I am making out a
hundred or two hundred dollars saved and
it's like matt has makeup like this is
incredible to me that I was making money
yet spending it all and only having one
hundred dollars in the bank like that's
not okay I'm definitely not where I'm at
now so I'm so thankful for my money to
use my little gears that switch up there
looks like this video money and now is
good great so yeah anyway like I said
yesterday a headache level of but I
watch the Gilmore Girls reunion season
things okay a year our life so it goes
on to like the winter or fall winter
spring summer whatever or dirt went in
in Sicily for Gilmore Gilmore Girls
movies because it was an hour and a half
an hour and 45 minutes or 40 nights or
whatever for episodes so it was
basically watching for movies with
anyone else severely underwhelmed but
it's just me I love you Gilmore Girls I
watched it when I was going to do I push
my freshman year I watched all of the
seasons like stats effect about the
wreck site but marathon I loved it I
really loved Laura life character I'm
not going to Rory she kind of knows hell
out of me like she's a crash with
whining and who the character annoys me
I love the relationship though and I
really like boy like she's funny um
would anyone I was just like so like
come on like give me something more like
yes I love bevarly and Luke relationship
and Rory and all the cameos of all the
characters coming back it was great and
I love Stars Hollow is so cute but if
they're just hoping that like wasn't
there wasn't clicking
because Sookie have more than two
seconds literally that pissed me off
because I love Melissa McCarthy and in
that show and she just like wasn't in it
to the last at the end of the last
episodes already a casino ruin for you I
want to give any spoilers so if you like
how many guys you're gonna watch at
least like skip this part
but um yes that's a giveaway much she
just wasn't in it like I remember being
on Ellen she's like Indian arrows you
said something everyone's looking girl
 wasn't hey I was like okay um
Michelle or whatever annoys the hell
outta me new character is so annoying
you know always complaining and whining
and
like and he's always complaining just
Michelle stop I love Paris I'm doing
with your parents trick I love her I
always did I thought she was so sassy
and Rory's annoying so I could get
Sarah's like display and I thought they
were like enemy the person under like
friends they go to all the school
together uh I really like her her
character and she came back now as we
can adult with a job in the short
haircut I'll put your yes please um Dean
annoying as hell oh my god he like they
have like a two a second like meet in
the little grocery shop and you just
need a new one too
I was like looking goodbye like you're
annoying me I don't know I always wanted
her to end up with Jess I Logan did it a
lot but he and I like to move ship and I
don't be the cheating on sales I don't
really greatly do so like I need to go I
love death could be just a little like
everything he's a bad guy but he would
know I just like in the town I love it
and Emily Laurel I thought I loved her I
love that character and I thought okay
so I like Richard I know he passed away
two years ago we can very sad because he
doesn't mean he's not there and it was a
lot about him in it I don't know if I
was taking stay approach to bring in his
memory as they did like I like the
funeral quest they did to dedicate with
him but I don't know it just felt like a
little beard and I like to live like
just a picture of him but like the whole
like big picture fight I don't know if
you don't see this you know I'm talking
now there are just a little underwhelmed
the whole thing in the last second the
last thing Rory says I'm not going to
say it but like which is cliche typical
cliffhanger I was like girl bye
uh-uh okay anyway I start school and
literally three days well for Tuesday
but like three full days I have cussed
and I'm just like damn like I want to
toast our a little about my gonna go is
go and buy that bag like I'm going
school no time what
um but yeah I'm ready I'm ready to do my
a Knopf writing on the semester I love
being Thursday love homework or love
full of education so I'm really excited
to go back in and have more classes
directly in my major in my minor the
concentration area so it's no longer
like Jenna's I'm really excited to dive
into my second option junior years in my
sixth semester in college which is just
mind-blowing to me oh my god cuz I feel
like that I would just
freshman year and it was a horrible and
now I'm like almost a senior just like
I'm graduate next year I graduate just
making blows my mind it's incredible
it's like absolutely incredible just I
can't believe how fast cultures passed
by because I'm having fun having it
socially oh my god over well um yeah so
I guess that's a hole-in-one to talk
about oh no laughing yes everyone's
asking about Jess you don't know
Japanese new my channel just in the best
friend for six years um twisters nests
or whatever years jeff has been my best
friend
so he's a Mormon so he's on his - your
mission right now in Anaheim California
if you didn't know that's why I haven't
seen its best friend in two years it's
like having your best friend ripped out
of your life minimal communication can't
see them can't make time that you can't
text on there on long leave all of us to
look they're really hard but at the same
time we're getting through it he left in
always just 15 that to obsessing over
2016 in few years over so we coming back
August 7 1753 wait um ah I can't wait
it's like amazing
um but yeah this I mean almost a week
and I was doing it every week until we
got a little bit of like a kiss in Red
River in March of just 15 and we didn't
talk for our 2016 we didn't talk like a
little bit weird enough ID but it was
just like awkward and then you trying to
get through that and we're best friends
again and we just this mission has been
extremely hard come and missing so much
and I just want to talk to you like old
times in town get that again soon but it
it's getting frustrating now because
like the whole year 2016 was it went by
really fast and this year doable - I'm
sure but it's like we're so close now to
the finish date that it's like come on
like seven months up like oh my god but
I don't know I just I I this has shown
so much in our relationship and how much
we both equally care for each other
because it's not one
sided or one person like they're looking
more know we both cherish our friendship
so much and then I know that for a
factor that shows through our email
communication and through our constant
drives and once to push this
relationship forward and to not lose our
conscience over this strenuous distance
and lack of proximity and lack of
communication and lack of anything like
that and it's like everybody sounds like
sometimes which is the scary part and he
didn't die so it's not like I'm being
overdramatic but you know when you have
some that happens the way to you
sometimes Robert a script what they
sound like with their last sounds like
an epic the scary part but he's killing
him soon and I just absolutely adore him
he changed my life so better and I think
I've done the same for him I honor that
this is shown so much strength in both
of us this mission in an in our
relationship and friendship and we're
just so much stronger that we're
different people completely left putting
out some more selfish and I was always
worried and I was always nagging kind of
mean and nothing I'm a bright brilliant
perfect person now but I've grown so
much as I've shown on here and you'd
like to see me so often that you don't
necessarily see it as much as people
when he comes on and I'll sneeze change
so much and so the meaning of like us
the first time seeing him again is going
to be just absolutely incredible like
I'm playing a person and krei like I
want to get pictures and video and stuff
but I also don't want to ruin the moment
so I don't know what to do someone can I
take it for us but it's gonna be
incredible I can't wait like it gives me
goose those just like thinking about it
like a little spectryx well I'm just
going to see them again when you guys
find someone who is your best best
friend you'll know and it'll change your
life and you fight for that person no
matter what so I'll end it there I hope
you guys enjoy this video and I'll be

low anything you let me talk about
