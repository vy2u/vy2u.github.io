uninteresting I never really do story
time videos because I have nothing to
talk about
so the fact that we have like a legit
like you have good ish story time video
I'm going to go we got shared that right
now so it is all the time that I was
hanging with her and I landed in the ER
so this was like scary it really was and
I'll insert some pictures that I have so
basically we were having like a hangout
session in our in my room like we always
do and she was like taking snapshots of
me from my phone and my phones like the
big iPhone it's not like the little
teensy one I don't know how to like hold
this like I've never had iPhone six-plus
so I'm like she was taking snaps past me
with kid in my class wanted my homework
answers so I was like I'm not giving you
answers unless you get me something
because you know I'm like that but I'll
be some heat I talked him into buying me
a soda because soda I'm not like the
religious like healthy person no Madison
I love soda and so he got me a Pepsi and
after you asked for a cup yes I
specifically said I woke up and then so
I had it in my backpack for a really
long time and I knew that it was like
really hard and pressurized so then
Madison was like we need just shake it
and then explode it everywhere
so then I like shook it and like open it
and explode it everywhere okay and this
was funny test like we weren't doing
illegal stuff we weren't party we were
shaking up I see an opening in being
badass and Lugar insert clip now
she went till I put my phone down and I
guess like it flipped out of her hand
because it's so big and then her hand
hit the end of my room would he hit you
with it
the right no there's no it's this way
you can see it oh it's still like find
it in there so it's my left pinky yes I
tried to bend down to catch the phone
right and I hit my pinky on the bed
frame like the more beds it's purely her
roommate lease was bad and I'm like ah
like I always have it too klutzy things
I put my knee like fall I hurt myself
she hit it and we started cracking up
right we were laughing so hard I would
start the phone but that I caught it so
she's like hi yeah and like we're
laughing and she was that kind of hurt
man I like turned away because I was
like I'm like OCD so I was like there's
a bunch of soda on the floor like I need
to clean this up and she said she would
clean it up sighs fine I was still like
looking at the soda and then she looks
down she was Mohini and I turn around
and there's just give me chills I just
like remember it so exactly there's just
blood everywhere any blood will like
down on her hand so then I was like
let's go to the sink so I was like is
this thing in your yeah they're singing
about and so she turned on this thing
and I was like running I was like okay
whatever it'll just stop in like two
minutes
okay Madison was like mooing it's not
stopping and then I was like okay we'll
give it to a certain time like yeah I
think it was like 10:30 and then I was
like if it's not done by 10:45 yeah then
we can start freaking out because I like
I bleed a lot she like I get nosebleeds
a lot and I know that my blood since hot
easily cuz I used to take a lot of
acceptors their headache yeah I totally
cut that Ireland you guys know yeah cuz
my blood wouldn't clot for a long time I
was very thin and just like when it
clawed because about the etc and I took
which is like headache medicine I've had
in the back my head knew it wasn't gonna
stop for a while it was just a weird
circus yes it doesn't happen to everyone
so I was like like obviously I'm not
gonna bleed out from your finger but at
that moment yeah we thought I was gone
at first I really thought she was like
overreacting like that phrase that first
I cleared she was like me it's not gonna
stop and I was like yes it will Matt
it's like put a bandaid on it it'll be
right but then it's gushing like we're
15 minutes later it was still bleeding
so then she runs like I have to call my
mom
so then she goes it's like Mike I think
like 11:00 at night like a circus day
like everyone has to wake up for work at
school the next day like we were just
riding on like fun and riding ovens
innocent fun and then so she runs it
after him and then we had I was still
cleaning up a soda mess so then I went
to go throw stuff away and she was still
the bathroom but then she's like she
comes into my room on the phone with her
mom and she's like wait we have to go to
the ER and I was like I was like what
and then she's like great we have to go
to the ER and like that first I was like
are you sure but then like I got on
board I was like I'm not gonna mess
around my mom was a nurse and my dad's a
doctor so like I'm not someone who just
feel like oh he's going to ER and my
parents never want me to go and my mom
still was like I don't think you should
go right by me I'm a hypochondriac
that's being worried because it was it's
not like oh a cut like my finger was
gushing blood all of know it was like
pressure on it I was stopping my
circulation up here and it wasn't
clotting and like I already have
renounce disease which is like when I
get a cutter SIA also that affects the
blood flow because it won't stop as
easily because there's not normal that's
one of my hands so red blood rushing
there it's gushing even more there's so
many problems that were against us at
this moment yeah and it's like if I took
a thing off my finger for a second it
would ready to move in yeah like oh it
gave him like I had to have like a pile
of paper towels on my grass so she could
just constantly like keep going it
bleeding through our next problem was we
didn't have a way to get sometimes like
flu has a hospital yeah it's close but
not close one it was late night like
it's scary over there at night when it
had been like 2025 minutes this time not
slowed down in the slightest pretty much
gotten worse and we were just like yeah
no it did get worse any like I'm acting
we were just like we should go to the ER
like I was like oh she's freaking out
you start to get worried - well
rightfully so cause like I was freaking
out we're best friends and you were like
why not I'm like I was gonna respect any
decision she made she wanted was the ER
go like we're gonna leave without saying
like I think God no she was really
scared and she was like shaking because
of like the blood that was she was like
literally standing there we're in the
elevator and she was like stuck Mohini

and like hurt her literal fear is like
fainting I was like dude if you think I
got like you know honey or didn't eat
dinner for like what three hours ahead
and drink any water like I was losing
like quite little to the blood and
I was like I was just like shaking
yeah so she calls the only person she
knows that like has a car right now that
would help us out at 11:00 at night in
city shout-out to Easton thank you
so I call him and we're like we need a
ride to the hospital they take us and he
was like oh crap like okay I'll take you
right away he's I can't be there
yeah he knows Madison - he's really good
friends with both of us we met him
downstairs he knows could you have a
pants on bless his soul and so we drove
to the ER so then we literally pull up
and we have to go through security like
to Garrity like was it worse at airport
it was like take out stuff your pockets
yeah we didn't have anything you know is
like your minimum checkers yeah it sound
like all that and I was like we're
trying to get medical treatment you're
making us like get naked so we get in we
get past and they're just like people
sitting there and the weirdest not Oh
seats no seats were full I'm like how it
does many people need groaning you're at

room oh we don't go to the emergency
room because you don't have an emergency

that's right like it wasn't hadn't
seized like you guys like okay well a
finger but no really oh gosh if I didn't
have a paper towel a night flight your
second say Pedro yeah and then when we
got up to the window there was like four
ladies there but none of them gave us
the time of day so we're doing like
waiting at the window for 15 minutes
before they're really right why are you
here oh you didn't even come till I
talked to us we were like I got my
company this where I'm gonna die I mean
it I was all these poor people see she

like okay that's not gonna work so then
I'm like really cool with the people at
Easton's floor so then we went on his
floor to see if anyone had like gauze
and like going on tape or whatever asked
me in Hebei I'm just like put my finger
right so we walked all the way over back
to where I live this is a span of like
four hours yeah like this entire night
was like four hours so like it has
subsided a little bit by now like when
we sat outside the nurse was being no
help I was like okay guys like it's
bleeding but it's gone down thank God
like I drink some water in it some
petoria crackers yeah I made her like
eat some like mess and you need to drink
water like we went in my room and I was
like shoving all these bottles and right

we got the gauze so if someone he's from
the girl band at all
oh yeah he's like sure no problem like
us I'll get back to you later and he's
like no that give me God and like I'm
nice born and like all that stuff you
got tapes tape with my finger and her
finger I was like literally like this
big after we're done mom my god it I had
lost feeling I got my note I really was
like her finger was purple people
exaggerate where they're like oh my
finger was a purple know her baby there
was purple in before we were in her room
before you and left to the hospital I
was like I like I actually lost feeling
like I was like I can't feel this it
should take wait what and I'm like am I
gonna head choking like I let me kick up
a finger anymore I take it up like East
it was trying people were like you
know I'll just do it see what's gonna
bump it yeah and I kept checking it that
whole nice to make sure it had like
blood again sounds like it's are fleeing
I don't know how its most separate and
then like before she left she like gave
me her mom's phone number and I was like
text me if you need him y'all keep my
phone on tonight like it was just like I
know I was like if anything happens
really done yeah um but the most
surprising part of this whole situation
was when Easton came back he wanted to
like see how she hit her finger and like
out of the bed like cut her right and
instead of the bed hurting her she had
actually cracked the wood frame of the
bed from hitting
my red frame was it cracked all the way
down like I had hit it Chinese funny
it's like she's a karate chopped it and
it like split and I was like what just
happened like the whole name was broken
stayed up a lot of that night I went to
bed like me before everything happened
so fast but right no slow right like
nothing was moving but like that nice
yeah that's blur like we were like oh it
happened then we called Eastern right
away we already got to the hospital we
already left the hospital we tried
calling that wretched nurse right and
then we put the gauze on her hand she
went back to her my room then we went to
her apartment but I was like so happy
though I was like that just shows like
how good friends like I have a question
Mohini look what I call anyone that I
needed who would like stay with me the
whole night was like just like sleep
here in my room like all this happened I
was like cool things like you're just
like incredible to have something that
like will take care of you no matter
what no the best part was we but she
tweeted she's like 10 thing this name I
end up in the ER day and then the guys
like a message and he's like yeah it's
like and like it was really refreshing
to know that like someone someone else
cared
wind-ups text yeah because other people
like who pretend to like care and want
to know all of our business they didn't
say anything right which enterprising
even like my roommate and I didn't get
along that much even at that time it was
still a little right but like when I
texted her she was like oh what happened
like details the reason why my remaining
I got got closed one reason was because
of medicine like she United us and like
now we're best friends all three of us
right as friends and I love it like I
wouldn't change anything like great yeah
we didn't like each other from the
beginning but like it's an experience
there was two people who cared and Ray
and it was good to see that those people
did care is it you know who's like
doesn't just want you for like
information exactly a good time like
they're actually making sugar okay which
I meant a lot I was like wow I don't
think anyone would message and I was
like wow so when I shake carrot that was
