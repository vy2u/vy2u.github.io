video that I'm very excited about
something in my forte because it's the
ins and the outs of fashion and trends
and certain things like that for the
summer of 2014 the year were in now so
I'm really really excited to do this
video I'm doing things from shirts to
bottoms to dresses everything I'm going
to tell you what's in what's that
no these this isn't like everything you
have to follow if one of these things is
something you love to wear then wear
that it rock that be confident in it and
you'll start a trend but it's just
things that I've seen die and I'm not
wearing them necessarily anymore so it's
mainly my perspective if you have a
problem with that I'm sorry but it's
just things that have died down for the
months of summer so that further ado
let's get started so the first thing I'm
going to be talking about is actually
shorts in my bottoms and stuff so what
is out for summer 2014 are these super
super short bootie shorts okay the ones
that are you know up your butt cheeks
kind of high-waisted those are mostly
out I love to wear them and just like
showing off my legs but these are kind
of out you know the little pockets hang
out just not really cute anymore if you
still wear these great grand and
terrific but the new things that are in
are these patterned pants I've seen
these everywhere I have like two pairs
of them they're my favorite things ever
and they're super comfy they're like
pajama pants and they're patterns and
they go all the way down their pants
they have pockets in them you can get
them at Target I just love them so much
and you need to remember that less is
more no matter who you are how old you
are less is more by covering up your
legs not everyone gets to see you're
like so there's something special but
yeah I learned that you don't always
have to you know have your legs showing
off your tan you know if you just wear
pants and these are just as fashionable
and they're just as cute and you'll look
snazzy in them and these are very very
much in pet
pants adorable they're very lightweight
so you might be like a summer pants
summer pants you live in a really hot
spot maybe just wear these out of cold
your day but I love wearing these during
the summer and the temperature doesn't
bother me at least the next thing I am
showing are dresses that are in and out
the first is the dress that's out and
it's hi-low dresses these still are
shown a lot next thing I see a lot of
girls wearing them so this is mine it's
orange and it's you know high in the
front and low in the back it's very cute
and fun for the summer and I wear it all
the time last summer but I'm just seeing
this trend die out at least I think it
should because it's kind of getting old
I really do not like high low things
anymore it's just my perspective again
like I said but yeah this is just it's
going out high-low more like heck no but
I think that's in now aren't these
dresses that are off-the-shoulder they
hang off your shoulder they kind of have
this area weird thing under your armpit
and they hang about here but they're
very very comfy very cute you can get
used to the weird air you feel around
your armpits and shoulders I love them
and I love this print especially it's
very floral and also a thing about
dresses it's a shift dresses which is
very very in high-low no but a shift
dress is something that doesn't
necessarily give you tons of shape and
body it just kind of hangs there like a
sack which may sound unattractive and
stupid but it's actually really really
great and tons of people tons of people
are weighing that especially people that
are preppy the next two things are
shirts that are in and out for such like
the t-shirts that are out and second
I'll show you the two shirts that are in
so unfortunately this is gonna be down
for a lot of people but the first shirt
that's out our peplum shirts
I believe these we're a huge trend last
spring and last summer but they're just
kind of dying out they're very cute and
they give you a great shape you know
they make your body look fabulous but
they're not really is that cool anymore
and I believe that it's not or and
shouldn't be a trend the next year
that's out is the number one thing that
is out for summer 2014 fashion crop tops
and cross prints I don't know why this
was ever a thing I was a few
huge lover of cross print things and
yeah it's cute I just don't necessarily
get it especially like these upside-down
ones I don't really get what that's all
about
and crop tops they're cute I personally
wear them all the time but I do think
the trend should kind of calm down
kind of like turn up that trend and have
waisted shorts that trend and twerking
that trend I think those things should
kind of died down I drew them all I love
them all but the shekinah
calm themselves a little a little bit
this shirt is just I this is everything
that should not be a trend in one item
one clothing piece this needs to go I
just I I love crosses but I don't like
this and I like crop tops but crop tops
mean you know what I mean
fine t-shirts that you can substitute
those coding pieces for is this first
one I don't know exactly what this is
called but I see these shirts and for
you where I got this one at Bay Bay but
it's super cute it's like a nice deep
v-neck plunge neckline and then this is
just cute little floral print and then I
kind of kind of comes down like a
triangle like shape as you can see here
same thing in the back I really really
love these kind of shirts they're a
little risky to wear so you might not
want to wear this all the time but these
aren't very bright and I see them
everywhere in stores and magazines and
another shirt that's in are chevron
print shirt said I'm not just saying
this because I'm going to college in two
months but Chevron is prayer that you're
seeing everywhere you know a lot of
things like camo is dying down and
Chevron is coming in it has been in for
a while
and I just like these nice flowy little
tank top shirts it's easy to substitute
this super super cute item for a crop
top the last things that I decided were
in and out for summer 2014 fashion
trends were dresses again and the first
one camo camo anything camo dresses
chemo anything is out I'm sorry I loved
camel I was the greatest camo
Queen last year I was wearing camel
leggings from camo backpack with camo
shirt with camo freaking makeup and
literally everything everything I wore
was camo but camo is sadly sadly leaving
us yeah I just can't do
dress anymore it's out I'm sorry I'm
sorry if you wear camel great-grand
trifa croc that but it's just not cool
anymore it's kind of like the cross
trend it's kind of like not in anymore
but I think that is in aren't white
dresses I love what dresses mites from
really Blitzer obviously yours doesn't
have to be I wear this and like a
bajillion to one pictures you probably
saw most on my Instagram from graduation
I wore this under my it down my cap and
gown and after the prints already to get
a solid color or get white I love white
and it looks great
even if you're pale like me makes yo can
if you have a knee it makes your tail
shine so I hope you enjoyed my video of
