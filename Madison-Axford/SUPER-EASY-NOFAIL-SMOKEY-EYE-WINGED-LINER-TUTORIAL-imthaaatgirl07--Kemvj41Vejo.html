you baby on you lady
hey guys so today is a super easy smokey
eye in winged liner tutorial the key to
this is just putting tape down putting
tape at the right angle that you want
your liner in smokey eye crease shadows
to follow will just help this look
becomes so much easier to accomplish so
I'm going in with a Sonia Kashuk
blending brush in my Too Faced natural
eye palette and using the dark Browns
and the nudes to carve out my crease and
this is just really the whole crease
color in the transition color and I'm
also winging it up as if I was doing a
winged liner but with the shadow and I'm
gonna go in with a flat shader brush and
a pearl ish ivory whitish color and just
petting that all over my lid as you will
see in a few seconds so I carved out my
crease and winged up the shadows with
the Browns and then just put this nice
white color over the lid and that
creates a super easy smokey eyed that
way you don't have to worry about the
lid color disappearing when you put on
so much heavy crease colors by doing the
crease colors first and then just
applying and petting down the lid color
later then you'll see in a few seconds
yes here we go I am taking the Sonia
Kashuk blending brush again and blending
the Browns that I applied prior to the
white and blending it in with the white
so that the whites not just sitting on
top and this creates a super easy smokey
eye you can do this with Gray's blacks
whatever is but I chose to do Browns
because the Too Faced natural eyes
palette is mostly news and Browns I'm
talking so that somebody got and I have
so much to say then the key to this
tutorial like I said is the tape the
winged eyeliner portion of this video is
very long I probably went to another
winged eyeliner tutorial for a very long
time if you know how to do winged
eyeliner or you're not interested in
this just fast forward like a minute or
two because I'm showing you the full
in-depth tutorial of winged liner winged
liner the key to this not only is the
tape but it's slow and said steady wins
the race
and I've charted you winged eyeliner so
quickly and it will not work because
they will not be even with each other
winged eyeliner are there are sisters
they're not twins but they are supposed
to look kind of similar like a similar
dimension is similar angle and you know
depth and height to the line so this cat
eye I just kind of wing it out I start
like the middle of my lid i wing it up
to where I want it or how high I want it
to be according to the shadows and the
tape and then I just go in and fill it
from my
the corner of my eye and then up to the
wing and you go to the top you can see
here and then drag it down and you can
fix any you know mistakes unevenness or
color it in and fill in the blanks of
skin that are showing later but yeah you
just have to go slow and steady with the
liner otherwise they will not be similar
they're never gonna be the totally you
know same looking line or wing but you
can try to get it close if you just take
your time
so here I'm doing it on the other eye
again if you don't want to watch this
part I'm sorry I am talking very fast
but I have a lot to say about this
particular look I'm just password if you
don't care but it took me so long to
understand how to do a winged eyeliner
and my perfect edit no not by any means
and I can't really do it that well
freehand so tape is just awesome for
beginners or experienced makeup artists
I'm not one of them but I'm a beginner
but for anyone just to have a nice base
and something to go off of and you'll
see here when I remove the tape that is
a perfect almost winged liner that I
could not do or achieve without that
tape the tape just kind of is nice to
make a mistake and then it just comes
off because it's on the tape then I'm
gonna go prep my eyelashes with benefit
they're real mascara I love this mascara
it's amazing I just tried it for the
first time it's in the shade black and
it really does lift my lashes up and
helps them blend perfectly with the
falsies my camera was being a real bitch
during this tutorial and died after
every tooth makeup steps so you do not
see me apply false lashes if you want me
to do a false eyelash tutorial I will
later but I'm sorry that that cut out
I'm really pissed about it to him here I
sped up the process of applying my two
favorite drugstore foundations l'oreal
infallible and covergirl three and one
fabulous
whatever foundation i mean using a
stippling brush from royal and
langnickel brushes my favorite brushes
and i am just blending this all and I
always use a Beauty Blender to apply my
foundation so this was something new
what for me but I enjoyed it it gave a
nice tip of the book rather than such a
matte cake to look they're both good but
this was a nice difference for me make
sure you blend it down your neck oh my
god and then I'm going in with my
Maybelline concealer whatever this is
pro conceal I think it is all the
products will be listed down below under
my eyes where I have very dark circles
around my nose Cupid's bow forehead
bridge of nose and chin just to
highlight because it is a lighter shade
than my foundation so I want to
highlight and make sure my face is even
rather than just putting under my eyes
I'm blending it in with a dampened
pre-clean beauty blender this is where I
can never do a tutorial that my beauty
blender this is where the beauty blender
comes in I sped this up a little bit
because you get what I'm doing I'm just
making sure it's all blended and yes
then I'm doing something special I'm
going to bake my face I love this I love
love this this is a thing that
drag-queen started where you let your
makeup or you let the powder sit on your
face for 5 10 15 20 minutes and so I'm
doing under my eyes I'm doing underneath
my cheekbones my forehead my nose every
area except my contour I'm really
putting powder just to set everything
and make sure it doesn't slide or get
greasy throughout the day and then I'm
also dabbing bronzer on my cheeks I
think I used a yet too faced chocolate
soleil bronzer for the bronzer and I'm
just packing that powder on and then I'm
like letting all that powder sit on my
face for about 10 minutes I think I did
now well I was letting my stupid camera
charge and then you'll see in a few
seconds I brush it all off or just
really black but boo boo brush it in
blend it in with a different royal and
langnickel brush so I'm just brushing
that powder in and this really sets the
powder and I also applied blush you can
see there the Pink's on my cheeks but
the camera also cut that part off but
you know I just dab to the blush on the
apples of my cheeks so I'm blending this
all in I'm using this tiny brush for the
powder and then I'm going in with a big
buffer brush for the blush and bronzer
to be all blended in seamlessly this
just defines everything more it really
just sets the powder in Defiance need
bronzed areas of my cheeks more so
here's my really thick royal 9 nickel
brush that I love and this really gets
in there and blends that bronzer out
because you don't want it to look like a
harsh line I've always done a harsh line
and it does not look good and it took me
so long to realize that it looked bad
matter so it looks like a brown marker
so I'm also blending it down to my neck
I hope I show that I don't know if I do
but and also up to my temples I'm taking
this chela eyebrow gel I don't do
anything to my eyebrows for near this
channel hi my eyebrows are natural I'm
very blessed but I just blend them or
not blend them I just set them with a
gel so they don't go haywire throughout
the day and then I'm using Too Faced
better than sex my favorite mascara to
coat my bottom lashes and I previously
lined them with black eyeliner from Mac
which is in the shade smolder just to
line my waterline and tightline to
complete this look I'm taking NARS
karela lip liner lip pencil whatever lip
chuckling I love this look at my guy
like so cool all right I love this shade
is a nice pinky red it's not as red as a
true true red but this was a free gift
like score birthday and then I went that
day and purchased the real full version
of it cuz I loved it so much and it's
the perfect red shade to complete this
nice sultry sexy look and I really like
it it's a very classy look and it's so
simple all you need really is tape in
your makeup products and you are good to
go so that I'm just finishing this look
with my skin to Naevia setting like
spray makeup finisher and I love this
stuff it really does set all my makeup
in place and keeps it there throughout
the day I hope you enjoyed this video
thank you so much for watching and I
love you guys see you in my next video
bye
