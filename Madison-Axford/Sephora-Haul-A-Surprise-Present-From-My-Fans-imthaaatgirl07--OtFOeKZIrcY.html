Wow Madison Wow another huh but today it
is mainly from Sephora all right okay so
I got a lot of stuff but before I get
into my hall I wanted to quickly say
something um that I saw on my Christmas
haul it was on my Christmas home where
um someone a few people commented it and
they were like you know why you doing
halls you're acting like you're not even
thankful for this stuff everything like
you know you're better than people like
you're just showing up at your rich and
that's what I absolutely cannot stand
about you too i love everything about
you two but the one thing that really
bothers me is that people don't know you
people don't know my background or what
kind of money myself or my family makes
and some people just be like you know
you're so selfish and you are just like
greedy and United thankful for the stuff
you got no okay you do not see anything
outside my videos you know you only see
good a quick little few seconds I
thought I talked about what I got on my
videos and you don't see how I reacted
to the presence or things like that and
I just wanted to take a minute because
to stay saying about it because we
really did you hurt my feelings and
that's a reason why I never do holes and
the fact that I keep doing halls is
because you guys are asking for more
holes and you're like when you get any
more halls stuff like that and why don't
you come for you I just don't spend
money I really really don't and I mean
everyone does a Christmas haul so I was
obviously going to and you know i said
my disclaimer that I don't people to
think I'm doing this to ryan cuz I
wasn't but it was everyone's common on
my Instagram pictures were dismiss also
of course I was going to do I'm for
people that wanted me to him and I hurt
me to see that people were just so mad
that I was like showing things I got
they were like why don't you get for
your money they're like charity and my
family does I we give just so many
charities it's not even funny and we
love to do that and we have the ability
to do that and it's a great feeling
inside so don't tell me that I should be
giving to charity when my family already
does like I love you guys so much and if
everyone that's watching it's not you
guys it's none of you I just want to
tell you that this really does hurt my
feelings and I do try to read most of
your comments in that person i banned
from my channel because it's not okay
for them to say that but my family gifts
to you know st. Jude's Children's
Hospital Ronald McDonald House Toys for
Tots disabled and paralyzed vets the
American Heart Association and like the
list goes on the gluten
you've just so many and it's just it's
great and I don't know it just bothers
me because just think this job this goes
back towards the other time but just
think really quickly about what you say
and leave in common on people's videos
no matter how big or how small the
youtuber is because they probably read
them and that will affect them this is
probably the last holiday for a while
because well the negative feedback I've
gotten from them but I know that
somebody both don't want to see what I
got and I love love love watching halls
I think they're great and I think it's
awesome because i don't necessarily note
it just to buy the products that I have
you know I research them or i watch
other people's videos and then I'll buy
him because what people have said or
what people have bought you know so I
just think they're kind of helpful
anyway sorry about the somber beginning
but let's go on to mess up for a whole
first thing I got is a lot of these
different rights that are the packages
so sorry to ignore that the first thing
I got is the two faced natural eyes
palette you can see that I loved she
faced a recent recently become one of my
favorite brands I never liked them
before for some reason I was like really
against two faces i kind of like to face
but i love to face now and I the day I
hadn't even tried anything with to face
before it's just really judging a book
by it's cover which I don't know why
because it's beautiful but anyway it's a
neutral eyeshadow palette so these are
the colors I don't know if you can see
that there's really natural pink stands
Browns chocolates really good colors i'm
so excited to do a makeup tutorial on
Stan so I'm really glad I picked that up
and I already cracked into it cuz i love
love love the colors then I got another
charge foundation which I don't know if
i'll be using this anytime soon because
I'm loving my fit me foundation right
now but this is just a backup for when I
go back to college and I'm not able to
go to stores you should be easily and so
I need to stock up on products and I
there's like no sephora at mizzou so um
but this is just the Tarte Amazonian
clay full coverage foundation I get a
lot of crap for this as of when I wear
this because it is very dark but I love
to cover up and when I do out of a zoom
I do find that Mexicans bring out a lot
more and I want more cover up so this is
great and amazing for cover up covering
up everything I got to urban decay
products I got just a classic eyeliner
in0 they are black just a regular back I
max I need a new one and then I got then
I also ever directed to this is the
Urban Decay eyeshadow midnight rodeo
it's just a beautiful lid color it's
really light kind of a beige tan brown
very very light with gray undertones I
love it I'm looking for a new base
because i'm almost out of my steel
kitten i'll probably end up going and
getting another steel kitten but I want
to try it I'm every day one because I
always loved their eyeshadows and I love
their palates oh and then I got tons of
first aid Beauty I love first aid beauty
and I have their own ultra Repair Cream
face and body lotion moisturizer stuff
that I love I use every night and it
works amazing wonders for my skin it
keeps my skin super hydrate every night
but I picked up by first a beauty
products so EA go me the first thing i
got is something that i don't really
necessarily need i wouldn't say but i
just really want to try it and it's the
idd triple remedy instantly brightening
d puffing and smoothing you're under ice
the skin underneath your eyes so is what
it looks like you it squeeze down it's
like a brown color on one side and then
you rolling in with this metal the metal
I guess it's like warms our something
like heats up your under-eye it makes it
less puffy and mine's not puffy is just
very dark and very very very purplish
circle so hopefully this will brighten
this up get rid of the dark blue veins
under my eyes and then I got their ultra
Repair lip therapy i used to have jack
black slip therapy and i use you know us
foals and soft lip cubes and i love all
those but i really love deep lip
therapies and i love jack black's lip
therapy in sweet mint or something i
love that but I ran out of it so I was
like I'm getting tons of first aid
forsaken first day beauty uh stuff so
why don't I just try it their lip
therapy as well and I tried it and I
love how it feels it's very very thick
there's no petroleum in it which I
really liked so I love that all right
try it it's really great and then I got
their face cleanser smaller size and
this is just like a face wash I'm pretty
sure my exactly sure what face cleanser
is but I've never tried one really
before besides just a face wash your
face wipes so it's like why not why am I
not going to try this by the heck not
sometimes want to go to make sure to go
a little crazy it's very very very very
every bear like every five years maybe
no but um it was just a day where I was
like I want to try new stuff I wanna you
know get some new stuff so huh so that's
what I did with this so it's just a face
cleanser remove surface oils makeup dirt
and grime I always say that I love that
so yeah and she can try that out then I
got some facial radiance pads that
exfoliate tone and brighten your skin
I've always wanted to try these so badly
but they're kind of expensive but again
it was just one of those days where I
was like what the hey everyone raised
and talks about these on YouTube um so
I'm excited to try my own thing the last
thing i got is my favorite thing ever
buy them in just one of my favorite
things ever ultra Repair Cream intense
therapy and I got this in a tube like
this last time that I use every night
I'm almost done with it but I decided to
get the big ol jug this time around
because why not I know I'm gonna use it
and know that i love it so I'm just
money another tiny one I was like I'm
gonna buy a bigger version so that's
what I did there so that was my Sephora
