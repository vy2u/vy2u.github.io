greatest song ever written the Fox it
came from Norway yo and you're not
obsessed with this movie unless you have
a two copies hey yeah so today I'm Jay
my sep tember favorites I cannot believe
that September's already over and it's
October my favorite time of the year
fall finally I just I love this 10 year
the weather is amazing and just like
smell like you know that's gonna sound
weird but literally you know I'm talking
about that fall smell you know what I'm
talking about you know anyway um I love
favorites videos except for the fact
that I don't have that many favorites
this month I do have you know a few
beauty favorites but that's really all
besides my favorite part of the famous
videos which is my music I love sharing
my my jams with you guys and um yeah
it's just I don't know I just love
talking about music with people so that
further ado let's get into my September
favorites so my first favorite is a lip
gloss lipstick whatever you want to call
it but it is more Gloucester than a
matte lipstick that's why I don't really
know what to call it but um it's called
a lip balm it's by L'Oreal and it's in
the shade for 18 caring coral and it's a
color rich rich rich lip balm and I saw
these are kind of hard to find because
they're always out like the bottom of
the Loreal like um stand like no one can
never like find these but i did and
literally this is the only lipstick lip
gloss whatever that I can put on my lips
and it won't look like I have like weird
creases like every time I wear lipstick
I get creases I get like little like
pieces of like lipstick that's like
shredding off Oh like onto my lips and
I'm like what is my life so this one is
glossy enough that it's not sticky like
the plus but it is glossy enough that it
doesn't create that disgusting crease
that matte lipsticks do on me I don't
know if it's something with my lips if
I'm not moisturizing or priming right if
I'm allergic to it i don't know but this
one is amazing i really want to go back
and give more colors there about eight
dollars i mean it's okay for lipstick
but it's a little bit of a downer since
there's much product in here anyway
since these really lipsticks that work
for me I'm gonna have to deal with the
price and I just I don't know I love
these lip balms so even though it
doesn't say it like right on the front
of the package these are by l'oreal if
you want to check them out of your local
drugstore next I have I think I showed
this in my last favors video my August
favorites and usually i found that I'm
kind of allergic to Rimmel face products
like the Rimmel makeup brand I don't
know their foundation never works on me
it's cheaper and cheap makeup just
usually causes like me to have rashes
and I know it's really disgusting but
just doesn't work for me but anyway this
is Rimmel stay matte powder like every
beauty guru here on YouTube has and I'm
literally in love with this stuff it
gives such like besides being just a
nice mattifying powder it gives such
like a healthy glow and I just love how
it adds a little more color to your fat
already like foundation or BB cream it
just mattifies it and just gives it a
little more like perfect porcelain look
with color it's not just translucent and
this is in the shade 011 creamy natural
I've used a lot of it so far and haven't
even hit pan which I'm glad there's a
lot of product in this it's literally
like four or five dollars i'm so glad
took the advice of all my other fellow
beauty goes on here and bought this
because it's definitely definitely
definitely going to be something that
i'm going to repurchase as well as that
lipstick next I've been kind of
researching how to not make my lips like
do that weird thing that they always do
lipstick and one of the main things you
can do is moisturize and I definitely
wasn't getting the moisture of my lips
that I should have been so I'm going
back to my EOS Falls I love us balls and
this one is the I don't know raspberry
one rice paper fade I just make that up
judge pull that out of midair probably
but I just love this one this is like
the raspberry when I'm embryos
respironics it's not light pink it's
like the darker pink and it's just a
little ball and it doesn't have any
color but tastes amazing and it's great
to put on even before this you know just
to give it extra moisture and to make
sure my lips don't do that weird thing
so I love this and you should definitely
check out us balls they're about two or
three bucks and what would bounce it
pounces what at your local drugstore am
at last beauty product is definitely one
for me because elf products which this
is now product never never they never
work for me their brushes break
literally break their products always
make something weird happen like it's
just they just don't work for me you
know i love Elvis prices I wish I could
like go out there and buy like a lot of
me
products from that line but
unfortunately I really can't however one
of the most easy things to mess up in
the makeup bowl is mascara like how many
Mexico's have you gone through that
haven't done anything for you that just
suck 100 tons my Maybelline tens by
high-end products you know but a three
dollar LF mascara and I'm really picky
with my mascaras cuz they need to be
great cuz i don't want eyeliner i just
want my scare us like that's my big pop
of like you know whatever on my eyes and
so another wear eyeshadow i just wear
mascara so I really have to find a good
one I'd love it to wear it and this is
elfs three in one mascara that lengthens
defines and volumizes and seriously I
can't believe this worked but I think
it's just because the brush because I
freaking him in love with this brush
you're gonna die oh it's like straight
and then there's a ball on the end and
it's perfect to get those little lashes
that you can never hit on the inside of
your eye like right here and on the
outer lashes at the very tip of the end
of your eye I'm in love with this
mascara I do still use my Maybelline
rocket power though that I also love but
literally this is such it does such a
good job get hitting all the lashes you
know and then the rocket power can come
in in like add more volume this just
gets them all it really defines them in
and make sure that none of them are
clumped together however one downside to
this that I unfortunately had to find
out the hard way is that it dries
superfast for one like literally you
can't it's not one that you can put many
coats on because literally it's like
dried so you need to like haul ass when
you're putting this on and putting your
rocket power on because it dries
superfast and also it is impossible to
get off I love this to death i will
probably repurchase it eventually but
it's like literally I'm in the shower
and I've used my makeup web so use toner
IDs I make remover I've used face wash
I've used everything i'm still like
pulling like and I know this awful for
your lashes but literally like pulling
trying to get these these like clumps of
mascara that are forming off and then
won't come off with my fingers and then
with a washcloth they won't come off I
mean eventually it does but I literally
I'm like pulling my lashes and getting
black huge clumps in the shower when I
get out of the shower at night you know
whatever it's just kind of a downside so
I thought I'd warn you about that but it
is three dollars and it definitely does
a great job while you have it on while
you take it off that some it's another
next for one food favorite I watched me
to be in 44 videos like always and saw
the cheese buying these kind bars and um
I really really really want to try them
but I can find them anywhere but finally
I did find them a target the easiest
freakin place but I couldn't find them
and um this I got the dark chocolate
nuts and sea salt kind even though
there's like three kinds at my target I
don't know if there's more but um the
sea salt seriously makes these bars I
love that part of it in the dark
chocolate I love dark chocolate other
than milk or white it's my favorite kind
it's just tastes so much more healthier
um and I love the nuts that is it's
great it's great it's great it's just
that um the whole bar is like nuts like
there's no granola there's no um I don't
even know like bar it's just nuts which
I like but some people might not like
cuz they like just a few nuts you know
here and there but this bar is literally
nuts with chocolate in the sea salt on
top but the whole bar the formation the
the components is just is just nuts but
i like it so just warn you about that
but i really like this this could
substitute as a whole meal seriously
they're great they're a little on the
more expensive side five dollars for
four bars not really a great price but
seriously I can't get over how like good
they taste they just taste so healthy
like there's such like I don't know you
can make indulge in them and they're
sweet and stuff but you know once again
you're not just having like salt you're
you're not just having milk chocolate is
dark chocolate which is healthier for
you so you saw which is apparently
healthier for you and and nuts which is
great source of protein and fiber so
we're Oh win-win here I love these
should definitely check them out even
though they are anymore pricier side for
granola bars and my movie favorite for
this month I am become obsessed with
watching movies and I had already own
this movie for 20 years um I'd write
seen it 20 billion times but I started
rewatching it and I literally watched it
like seven times this month and it's
clueless and you're not obsessed with
this movie unless you have a two copies
two copies of it and I still watch on
netflix i have two copies of it and i am
still watching on netflix i told my
friends to watch it it's literally my
life my life is this movie i am the main
character share you need to watch it
it's on netflix it's on I think YouTube
some itunes buy it at bestbuy
literally it's like five dollars at
bestbuy just yeah you need to watch it
it's such an amazing movie it came out
1995 so it is kind of older like an
older era but that's like I I just loved
so much you need to go watch it the
fashion image the words they use it it's
amazing and this is definitely my
favorite movie ever I have two copies so
4 sep tember music I didn't really find
much um I love the music part of the
city like i said earlier but I just
wasn't finding much that I wanted to
mention you know I love mentioning
things that I'm in love with I'm jamming
to in my car at level like 100 like you
can't go higher that's how Adam jam into
these and it's like I just I'm waiting
for my Cyrus in your Apple to come out
um you know I I listened a few songs
here like I really like burned by Ellie
Goulding I don't have that on my iphone
though so i can only show you that but
definitely check out burned by Ellie
Goulding it's amazing i love Ellie
Goulding i have since lights um but
anyway since i do have three other songs

grooving to those instead of burn sorry

Cyrus Wiz Khalifa and Juicy J miley
cyrus is literally my idol and I am in

this song it's really cool and it's
really fun to dance to the beat drop is
menacing
