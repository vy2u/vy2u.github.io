I'm other Disney characters you haven't
seen it you're crazy go see a girl or
boy go see it so today I'm going to do
my walt disney world hall for my spring
break trip if you didn't see any of my
vlogs i think i posted three or four no
44 vlogs and a hotel room tour of my
spring break trip for my senior year to
disney world in orlando florida orlando
florida what in orlando florida it was a
really really great time and I did vlog
it which is amazing and great for me so
if you want to watch those they'll all
be linked down below but i did buy some
stuff while down there actually quite a
few things surprisingly and I thought I
would do a haul a lot of people request
to this and I wanted to do it anyway so
without further ado let's get into it
the first two things I got is when we
went shopping on one of the days it was
really rainy in orlando so we decided to
go to an outlet mall and explore Orlando
um shopping wise rather than just Disney
park disney parksdisney apart we're
gonna go to an outlet mall so is really
fun in it but i only got two things at
the forever 21 there the first thing is
just something super super small and
it's just a little black bandeau i have
a black one from brandy melville but
it's just like straight across one in
this one actually cinches in I'd like
the middle of your boob area and I just
like these kind better um and so I just
got this it was like three dollars i'm
really glad i found one of those cuz my
favor 21 doesn't sell bandos but i'm
glad i found one there so yeah and then
the second thing i got was assault the
price tag on it 1280 is a huge makeup
bag and it's like pink and purple green
black leopard print it is super super
cute I'm planning on putting on makeup
like my entire makeup collection in this
when I go to college in the next few
months um cuz I won't have that much
room and it's very you know portable and
you can fit funds in here I'll show you
how much you can fit but they don't have
these in my favorite 21 either so i'm
really glad i found these things that
aren't offered in like st. Louis forever
21 but um yes this is huge and I really
don't that much makeup if i buy it i
would use it and i don't have that much
of a collection
the video before it was kind of a fail
um but you know make up that I don't use
everyday lipsticks foundations they'll
go in here and i'll just keep everything
in here for college will be super duper
handy and i'm really really excited to
use that then the next thing is also
random as well but I got it wild down in
Florida and it's banana boat deep
tanning oil I really went into tanning
recently like actually in the Sun I
don't do tanning beds I never will I
think that's really bad for your skin
but it won't actually tan with suntan
lotion and so this one has SPF of four
which is awful but I've always wanted to
try the tanning oils so it was on so
five dollars at target I just picked it
up and yeah i mean i don't know i really
like the brand banana boat so hopefully
i'll enjoy this as well um i might need
to put soon he'll ish and under it
because it's not really enough for my
norwegian skin but we'll see where this
you know which takes me i love it st.
Louis so the sun rays aren't always that
strong and it's kind of cloudy um
sometimes so i'll try to one of those
days then I get to movies the first one
I got is saving mr. banks and I didn't
see this in theaters but I really really
wanted to and the second movie i got i
did see in theaters it's my favorite
movie like a whole time now and it's
frozen frozen is the greatest movie ever
if you haven't seen it you're crazy go
see a girl or boy go see it via i got
this and this and i just love little to
see maybe some i picked those two up i
stayed at the old key west resort um and
I got this mug because I really wanted a
Disney mug so I found this one and it
got the purple lid one there's like a
blue yellow red or purple and I picked
purple it's just like a coffee mug rekha
put water or soda or whatever in it but
it's just really kidding it has all the
Disney characters on you got goofy
donald um Pluto Minnie Mickey and
cowbell what's correct what's up kid
what is that what is the girl cows name
cowbell but that it is now what is it
carissa no oh my god I'm still good with
these names I don't know why I don't
know anyway it's really cute and I can't
wait to get some use out of it then i
got a new iphone case and on it is Olaf
from frozen and I am in love with this
case it's super cute I just kind of
splurged on it and bought it I
definitely didn't need a new iphone case
but it is a lock on it and it's so huh
it's so so cute sides picked it up if
you like what I'm on vacation I try to
spend so much more just cuz you're like
I'm here you know once it like that when
is next time we're gonna be back I don't
know what's buy it so you know yeah
that's what happened then if you saw my
vlogs my London
one you would have seen that I got a
staff animal stitch and it's huge like
what it's like bigger than my head I
love stitch he's my favorite character
out of all the Disney characters so I
had to get this and I just love it then
I also really wanted this and I plan on
getting it when I went down there and
it's a gray sweatshirt zip-up thing that
has the Mickey Mouse characters on it
and on the back it just has this huge
like um picture since Walt Disney World
with Mario castle epcot ball and all
these characters and I just really like
it I really wanted this and kind of
childish yes but it's super cozy comfy
and i love it i'm gonna get a lot of use
out of it i'm really glad i picked this
up and the last thing i got it while in
florida is the greatest thing ever it's
my favorite favorite favorite piece from
the new Lilly Pulitzer spring collection
I just I just can't even handle how
beautiful this is it's amazing i wanted
it so badly i never thought i would get
at that I never even like I just I guess
talk a blue that's mine look at this
look at this leaflets or dress it's my
first Lilly Pulitzer dress but it's like
I feel so like weird it's like I'm just
I am like speechless when I see lilly
pulitzer is mine like i never thought i
would own something this like valuable
but yeah I love it it's perfect it's
literally amazing I need to put it over
here so does get wrinkled that's amazing
it should be like in the background of
all my videos I just I love it so much
