focused let's pray I just started this
and realized that this is a strip down
which means I can't get about so I
apologize for that angle um okay so
strip down video the Donald is it was
like a big cheese machine which is my
name's the first one I really enjoyed
doing it because you screw up I got to
watch myself the customers here okay you
screw up you messed up and whatever and
you don't edit out you don't cut it you
don't add special effects music
transitions pictures whatever you don't
have anything it's just you solely in
real time with your real mess up and you
just go with it so I want to do one
isn't for a while and you know if anyone
watch it still rolling gonna watch this
I just wanna do it because I've changed
new viewers I think there's so much and
I would you ask you to know the real me
I'm not saying that normal medicine so
you see isn't normal medicine um but I'm
matter we looked all oh you know
sometimes like not a reaction video all
the time I didn't want to ask me some
things but I didn't give much time I
would ask about like two months ago so
I'm gonna see if I got much on there but
other than I read I already wrote down
for the responses so I probably won't go
back on there just I want to focus on
what I already wrote down some clear and
things that why I do is touch on in this
video so yeah i guess i'll just start I
hope I'm not annoying in this but in
this is real time it's gonna be kind of
a mess kind of rambling ranting why am I
still talking about it like an intro
just a mess just get in the video as it
okay um right so first I would talk
about which was what a lot of your last
no time is like how I think I'm
confident how I became confident how
stay calm and I had to get confident
whatever comment is the biggest part of
my challenge want to always want to
promote so um yeah Constance what how to
achieve it that is an amazing question
um I
didn't you see confident at all but now
I can see myself literally so confident
the point where I've seen by some people
maybe I was a cocky asshole because I'm
so confident I'm not full of myself but
I'm proud of myself and I love myself
and there's a difference there's notice
between being like yes Queen get it gosh
yes you look good today you know was
humming yourself up and be like I'm
better than other people because that's
not what I think no no no no but I think
I'm the best version of myself that I
could currently be which makes me super
proud which makes me internally
confident we've been seeing through my
external confidence because I used to be
always really nervous always anxious Oh
II self-doubting myself always
self-conscious and it's your middle
school and high school and even the
first year of college and second
actually you're really Endel and now I
was non-severe stone and diva queen that
I claims to be I was confident okay I
didn't carry people say I wear whatever
I went squid whatever I wanted and who
wouldn't like me for it um you know I
said whatever I had stark opinions on
things and people got pissed but now
even more than ever I don't care if you
like me I don't care if you don't like
me I love myself I'm going to be the
best version my somebody they don't have
much time you know we all have a time to
live we have you know however times that
gives us and you've got to make the most
of each day so I wake up just normal and
in a no I don't sit there and choose oil
and be happier confident or proud or
love myself that day I know I think
today's a new day okay so I can either
be pissed negative which I am more of a
pessimistic person from you know I'm not
like the grass is helpful no it happens
the okay this is how I am but what I'm
saying is I don't have to like choose
anymore I don't feel like doing want to
try to get a good day do it you know
what about my um like sometimes there
will be some body parts that I wouldn't
be super happy with or my appearance or
acne or my teeth color my a scab or my
ribs sticking out or my stomach roll you
know certain things that we don't like
my hands are purple it is certain things
that that I
like about myself I don't care anymore
and so I wake up in the morning now and
I'm just like yeah I love myself I love
myself I meet only me in this world I
can try to replicate what people do and
be able to try to replicate what I do
but it's never this thing you're the
early person who gets totally exactly
how you are we think look exactly like
you act exactly like you be exactly like
you so why this is what I enjoy so
myself wishes but not what I want to
tell you I thought myself why wouldn't I
want to try to be the most lay Queen
version I felt that I could be why
wouldn't I want to try to be the
happiest the best you know looking
whether that would make up or without
the best attitude on things why wouldn't
I want to slay the hardest and
everything whether it's work school
YouTube friend relationship be the best
and it's the best for me isn't the same
level of best for you whether it's
higher or lower that doesn't matter like
to me being my best is making through
today without worrying without getting
insights of people or pinging types of
up with people without being negative on
myself and my appearance genuinely
loving myself and I look in the marriage
bed that's how I see if you're something
like making a million dollars a day or
just like just getting out of bed then
that's amazing you have for yourself
have goals whether they're smaller or
bigger than mine or anyone elses have
gold and achieve them and if you can't
gene them keep working and if you'll
achieve a different goal a lesser goal
or that goal um I love determined people
I love people who've Drive I love people
with goals I'm not saying you know so to
be the president I mean by all means go
for it like my best friend let's be the
president and I'm all here for it okay
grown yet but that's that's not I'm not
trying to do that I'm trying to do
something some father's been run this
country but still that is big for me
whatever my goal is um so yeah people
were like how are you so confident it's
like why the hell not why why not be
hospitalized and there's something and
open nervous people are always like I
want to find someone who loves me as
much as Mademoiselle
like I feel like that was sort of it did
but at the same time yeah I love I don't
why the hell wouldn't I people always
comment that I have a top packet of
myself on my phone and I'm like who else
right I have no but seriously I think I
look damn good in this picture so I put
my freaking face on the back my phone so
whenever people are like where's my
phone you know they all look the same we
all have iPhones I know which was mine
and I love it I think what I can say
good selfies with Santa's yes and um I
didn't know what else to play you know
there was no other option for me I
wouldn't get a picture of a star I'm
gonna get a black or white one you know
like a plain color not even a pink not
even a right you know my favorite so I
guess right like well not this would be
a good level of confidence the point
where it looks cocky because people are
like I need getting me like honey hole
lip or and thank you some people are
like best cream cheese puffs ate himself
I'm here for it everywhere like I am
getting maybe the amount of extra but
it's like I don't care okay I'm happy
with it I love it I paid 50 bucks for it
you know never been happier um it never
would have earbuds outside of myself fix
your happiness no okay weird rambling
madman um but yeah so people often see
me as arrogant or cocky I'm not I try my
hardest not to be rabid ocean with what
I have with what I can afford of what I
own whatever I try not to do that
because that's enough thank you but
combination mental except I damn love
myself and I'm like Alan show the world
because we're going to say that so like
when and this is the thing I notice when
people are negative in life or when
they're self-conscious or they critique
themself so much they critique others so
why six cool walking down the street
like sandals clothes high heels you know
on a chance how much were there orange
big earrings I'm like yes Queen slay me
the house down like if I see you know
I'm like yes come on work love that they
come back to copy on myself I love what
I do I love it I wear a lot but I look
like um incident that it agrees on that
coffee but because I know people are
like your show oh when you were
instead you you know I step I rap you
have a gap in your teeth your district
that you're that you know people
everything you don't like anything about
it no makeup and I look look so that I
can't change it I'm knocking it surgery
so this would have got to work with I
better like it anyway so when I see
people I because I'm so cop that are
like yes cleaned I noticed people who
are in Compton that I know firsthand are
a little self-conscious well judge
that'll be like what are they wearing
would they think they are it's like well
I'm going to do that didn't having fun
they're looking to himself and I will
afford that because yes you look
sickening whether I'm in old rags or
finance if I was a toilet plunger
absolutely but it says in compliment
them and I rarely give compliments
because I just always always focused on
like myself not that's also bad but I
hope you just like on my life's not like
doing like OCD I'm just like focus yeah
I do what I got to do see who I should
get see talk to who I ever got it stop
do it I'm not like understand and feel
all care to do it I care about myself
and I thought we all should be like my
job is it been foreseen I'm flying I'm
saw you swing okay so kind of done
I guess the confidence talk but just
love yourself I get mentioned sort of
set you know preventing from fully
loving yourself and and I'm sorry that I
can't tell you how to get passed back if
I don't deal with that I'm sorry
so I know you're like well you'll deal
with it you don't have this or you know
because I am I'm so fucking lucky and so
blessed that that I have to like I get
to live in set you know I think like
this and live like this a little bit
this is whatever you know I'm very lucky
I have my negative as far as I'm a
baggage whatever but I'm very lucky and
I recognize that and realize that I'm
thankful for that thank you guys so I
don't know what you go through everyone
was just on different envelopes or shit
but just know that this is you only
change you get on this first so you can
either be sad and live a crappy life or
do whatever you need to do to be
freaking amazing
so do that okay next happen because I
could just remember on and on about the
same thing about loving to Phil cuz I'm
fine ex point where I feel good like I
said I used to think like survivors mine
was ugly or I didn't accept them or I
would always wonder what people thought
about me I'd be like so paranoid about
people of judging me I don't give a crap
anymore me using the word crap isn't so
we're excite rying to not cuz that's
like the kids I'm sorry um
look but I'm gonna have like angry don't
I don't I don't care what you thing
about me
good or bad I mean good thank you but
you know it is not worth it okay moving
on I saw a comment about Jeff Jeff some
investors II don't know um I turned a
million times we've been best friends
for seven years I've been out incredible
well going on eight Super User best
friend he's a Mormon so after a special
year of college he went to BYU I was
going to do now I don't go to Missoula
but he went to BYU and Utah and then he
went on his mission which they are I'm
not a moment so I can't speak on behalf
of them but what I know about it is
they're like expected to go on this
mission and serve the Lord okay guy I'm
not probably there with other religions
in my own so I don't figure Mormons like
its way to me what it is but I tried to
be as supportive as I can I just don't
really know that religion too well um so
he is currently serving his two-year
mission and I'm tell mine are all around
California
the Anaheim area and come back August 8
or 9 8 oh okay
the first video I did when he left that
I remember I think was like a decor haul
and I didn't even wear makeup because
that's how sad I was I could ask mr.
Mike but I literally would just
sporadically cry daily stuff oh my god
okay anyway I would cry for lake's
Bradley on and off you know nothing much
um not every day but a lot I think it's
a daily but it wouldn't be every day I'd
be sad for maybe three weeks to a month
and I never really got like okay we can
do this until like six seven months had
passed like let's kick ass like let's
get through this mission he's my best
friend he changed my life forever more
and I did this into his I don't like to
read insights but like in a way you know
you have influence in person and so
that's what happened we gave androgens
like freshman year of high school we
were 14 literal fetuses I have a real
whole video that we did cuz that's
called like um the story of us I love
that video because one do it 40 laps we
don't like forget little stories or
details went to senior homecoming
together
we did everything together we graduated
it I mean we grew up together um and he
still my best friend loved him to death
and um yeah so I was going to see him
from two years two years but you don't
be your best friend like it's been a
while I can only email them once a week
in sometimes we don't do that because
I'm really bad at keeping up to date on
that because I get you know caught up in
my current life and I'm like oh my god
Jeff and I forget about him I think
about him every single day but I just
did that right email app sometimes
forget about that because I had accepted
the fact now that I can't talk to him
whether it's text or whatever call I
can't you can't do that it's my lap so
that's it hard taking a toll and we've
been through a lot of shape at two years
like like parts where the relationship
should have died and it didn't because
we're strong we carry a charger and we
would never let this relationship falter
because of proximity in you know
distances and lack of communication um
don't we love each other dearly and he's
coming back in two months I couldn't be
more ecstatic I'm gonna cry man when he
goes back oh my god I hope to tape it
but like I want to shave it so bad but I
also want to ruin the moment on say my
desert oh my god never leave me again
but I just like legalized college it's
incredible though because I when he left
LA and I'm a freshman or high school
college I was so almost like I was feel
like not happy not often anxiety just
not good and now I'm like overcoming
daya be a soul happy so strong so
confident so what does so but more
positive than I was wait left and I
still probably have an oversized ring to
a series that with me and see me as I am
now I'm just go through I'm excited to
have he exchanged and we're gonna catch
up and he like watching my videos I'm
gonna cry but it's great
I I'm so excited um okay
someone asked what might be ready to be
able tell us and it's hard because I was
actually in a music video what is it
but I thought exactly within one point
two seven seconds okay
I love change off any money or youtuber
to watch okay my favorite video of all
time is the carpool karaoke that Shane
Dawson did with drew Monson my toe cold
oh my god
I whoa you're going a frog I watched
that oh my god my way I have watched
that video um at least nine thirteen
times like that's probably on the low
side and I left a lot every time I
especially as your change Christ not
really drew it like myself humor I said
I am drew and so when I'm Washington I'm
like laughing out loud of yesterday I'm
just like watching it again for the 20th
time being pistachio and just dying
because it's so funny and they sing
these songs and it's like so ah nothing
like status might be read all the time
but I think that's a very long time
because I watched so much narrative sick
of it okay someone asked actually met
someone Chris Henry here on YouTube I
adore him adora oh my god go watch
contender and he's amazing I love him
such peace mellow baby but yeah I swear
when it's added with those are great 39
let's take them on RuPaul's Drag Race

drag queens they are incredible the
freaky most of making sure it's not like

like it's not that weird let's get in

saving my life after I left Mizzou I was
so just unhappy you know in my a my body
and my cell I didn't like myself in like
with but it's happened that year I you
know the dude was fine I got 4.0 both

way too early are you kidding me with me

lipstick menorah so pissing me off but
anyway I'm very passionate about this
this season well good because
everything's good I could watch anything
okay even all-stars one which is
horrible it's good but it's been a
little underwhelming I'm just going to
say because they have such a huge fan
base now ago everyone is like over a
million followers now that we're
building out everything I expected to be
just a moment
Oh Mason we got Lady Gaga the show
amazing but it'd just be kind of like
okay okay okay the whole season it's not
be like haha you know but six but this
name is kind of lackluster to me too so
I love it I live for I haven't you know
bought on iTunes I watch it repeatedly
um but it hasn't shocked me I don't
think anything will ever trap me again
as teasing like four and six days
because those were iconic but yeah I
love any bourbon straight thank you
nothing wrong and I'm you know I just
love it
moving on um I'm gonna finish about
audience be too long with talking all
friendships relationships you know
mentions and growth in boys Andrea ships
with you know boys you're both I'm
straight so I can't speak on that path
but just related to your situation
oh I always do this anyway um so yes and
that relationships message it I always
say this it's quality over quantity my
god oh my lord
okay I see people who have to a billion
one claimed friends and that's fine
and they told their whole life story
then and that's fine but I'm like yo you
can't have now many friends you can but
you can't because someone's gonna you
know not be super truthful honest loyal
trustworthy someone's acting and he
can't of everyone okay i right now have
three that's kind of pushing it but
three people that I trust with my life
um nothing I three friends the three
people that I know would be my writer
guys that I could tell I think you and
they do it okay for yourself
um I have acquaintances but I know that
I can't tell them things I've been I
have had for all my friends forever I'm
not a person that treats friendships
lightly I am extremely extremely loyal
if you are the same to me if you are
loyal and you're trustworthy I will be
like a real dog around you and be loyal
the same so it's talking about you I
will cut a bitch okay I will stick up
for you no matter if in there no I will
not touch on your back but if you given
me reason to not trust you not be loyal
it's a different story and shits going
down but if you don't I will be truthful
your fake I'll be on I'll be real if you
don't I know I off let me tell you oh
whoops um I'll tell you that you're you
know you know being annoying cuz you
have plenty to eat I'm okay whatever you
know if you rep screen makeup if you
don't look good in the shirt telling you
because that boy won't be okay you know
and I have I said to guy friends and a
girl that I trust my life
um and everyone else it's like a Dolman
fair but it's not or um it's not at all
but like I always tell me something I'm
like I don't know there's no friends and
people who I have to be safe or filter
it around I want to be my true on itself
you don't like it there's the door
right there to be away goodbye walk out
okay I've had people use me for
Instagram likes
I've had people use me for entertainment
for past time for gossip for dirt or
deep on people if it's not cute and I
can sense thickness and see about me and
I'm super smart I'm not going to be
talking about I'm super smart and I
think about things really easily but to
think about these I have to show it I
tell you if you say no i'ma call your
ass out I'm a rescue I've received you
know I will go off on a ho but also
there's some people sneaky and I can I
play the game I can be sneaky - I don't
know where this video is going but this
is the thing about me is like I won't
come out all the time will be like I
sent you a song
I'll talk about Lily we'll talk about it
let's talk it out no Susie this one girl
I don't really want to talk to you if
you just like wrong pull towards me I
really want to talk about if you can
give me no reason to trust you again you
give me no reason to give you back my
loyalties you know and you're not going
to gain my back
uh I'm just like I'm not going to see
you with boy Lenny so it's like if I
know you do anything wrong I'll be nice
to your fate not like thanks but I'll be
like nice to you I'm not a complete
bitch but also I take a loss like
literally everything like people think
that yelling passing under me but I
literally come on everything too much
and sometimes I think things happen that
they don't even happen or I like think
someone doesn't like me or testing about
means I didn't even act like might not
happen um yeah I think about everything
if someone I did send someone like
staring at me for like miles away but
that was actually like fake friends like
I've had so many big friends my char
life from freaking step okay from
freaking second grade on I've lost
friends I tell you everyone has but I
expected at this my eyes to not still be
losing friends as almost 21 in college
going to graduate you're going to be in
the real world I didn't expect to still
be dealing with people that are really
literally literally justifying the wool
like they're justifying the wolf like oh
my god they're there or to pass the time
and to get shit about you and it's just
like it just like makes me so sad
because I trust people I love you give
me a reason not to I'll trust you I was
playing the whole life story but I'll
trust you and once we break that trust
it just hurts so bad not like splinter
but just is like stings it's like hang
on okay moving on not your friend
anymore and I was giving people so many
chances are for know us stop doing that
almost because think about it will you
rather have one or two friends and love
them for your life and they love you and
you can trust you know each other
anything we say and be different one
another no matter what um oh you really
have like 20 people you don't really
know if you can trust you might be
talking about you says okay
they might be talking about you they
might you know actually not like you
they might not ask you to hang out yet
stuff like that would you rather have so
many friends and be known as a popular
person but not really be able to
trusting them or have two people and be
noticed like maybe you know so it is I
was made friends like us associate I'm
your whistle fit you know it's like that
you got to take that and so I choose the
book the ladder literally I would rather
have one person that I have so much fun
with than 20 that I'm like I think you
can trust somebody don't really know
they kind of give you advice no there's
no comparison there's no arguing for me
so yeah so six is my real friends
okay keep that on mind all the time my
voicing with leaving out so I follow
your friend Hedgehog okay and this straw
sorry is like so big I don't like cuz I
only get my lipstick all my stuff but
it's like hard to forget him anyway it
how I can exclude that was like with
relationship if you are meant to be with
a guy or girl if you flow that way
that's cool you are you gotta trust that
you will end up with them somehow
someway they will make it work if you
wanted to work if they wanted to work
will usually work together no matter the
reason no matter the circumstance no
matter the distance no matter that like
you won't believe you will manage to get
together be together work it out
together and in the interrelation
together it's nothing to work out it
won't work out and you got except that
you don't live it oh yeah I understand
but there's this is hard because I
understand the pain when you're like
with women you think you really like and
you thought really liked you and then it
doesn't work out you're like what the
hell oh no the only person for me I'm
never going to another person do I still
deal with it okay I still think there's
no one for me she's got to know that
someone's out there is going to accept
me for everything you are and more
someone's going to literally love you be
obsessive you treat you with respect
whether it's a boy you know with a boy
or girl a girl a boy there or whatever
literally you will find that person and
I need to watch this video it's real
common advice because I sometimes still
and like nothing ever we talked me
literally what is love love it's nothing
love everything and when you find it I
haven't but when you find it you'll know
and I'll know to it so I don't think
like don't give up on five someone on
relationships on love because you had a
bad relationship the pastor because
you're bad almost lotion of the past or
you had a bad experience in the past
like just keep you know it you're the
independent hoping to be independent and
never look back but this is for my
people who want relationships because
like you know sometimes a nice um know
that if it's meant to work out it'll
work out if it's not it's going to hurt
it's gonna hurt you guys long deploy do
you gotta do there's no crying in eating
ice cream
no you're worth so much frickin more
respect yourself and you should be
respected by others and move on for
yourself cry you know if we need to cry
you know take a bath or whatever it is
because I'd take a walk whatever you
need to do but then realize that you've
your own goals your own life that you
need to leave we've bleed and live it
perfectly for yourself
don't be hung up on food guy or some
girl that's not true you how you treated
so yes that is mr. John video I hope you
