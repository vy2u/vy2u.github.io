just will do it we're gonna do it
without further ado let's get started
okay number one favorite candle scent my
favorite has to be leaves twisted
peppermint or mahogany teak wood out the
vanilla snowflake and it's that kind of
vanilla bean Noel and just a petrol man
but I noted so kind of wintry sense
number two coffee tea or hot chocolate
hot chocolate number three what's the
best phone memory you have Halloween I'm
trying to think back to fall homecoming
yeah come on coming and Halloween number
four which makeup trend you prefer dark
lips or winged eyeliner i prefer winged
eyeliner i can do it better than I can
pull off dark lips but I don't waste
like wearing lipstick i hate actually
heat lipstick um this feat lipsticks
that I can actually wear and like like
but yeah when diner is always fun and
gives a dramatic look to any outfit I
can't wear dark lipstick so yeah I don't
have to be that way now in our tail
number five best fragrance for full I
don't follow fragrances like according
two seasons i wisht wear whatever I
where I am right now I'm wearing dream
war by gap just because it's fall I'm
not going to wear like a musky ur Center

yeah it's pretty much all I wear number
six favorite Thanksgiving food yeah
we're a little little late but my
favorite has to be or was when
thanksgiving was here mashed potatoes
all the ways my favorite food is potato
so yeah not weird to have BBQ here right
is that I mmm my favorite
Thanksgiving food is ham and we put it
my dad makes like this barbecue well we
use barbecue sauce and like put the ham
in it it's kind of weird it sounds
really weird and gross but it's actually
amazing like barbecue ham is so good i'm
47 what is autumn weather life where you
live um we live in Missouri so the
seasons change drastically so it's like
40 to 60 degrees depending on like what
it could be like freezing one day and

worn sweater my mouth water is my fox
cropped sweater from the bethany mota

this letter is about 32 bucks but I wear
all the time and it's lovely it's my
favorite my favorite sweater is this one
I'm wearing right now just keep home and
um it's very cute and it's so
comfortable I think Madison actually
meant yeah I do my idea that number nine
MOS must have nail polish this fall I
never ever like really paint my nails
and she always has her gel nails done
like french tip so we don't really like
or buy nail polish which is kind of good
saves money and pretend football games
or jumping in leaf piles football games

go to him before I did this year I
started going to him because I which one
I'm freshman year my entire like high
school career and then I started to go
to more this year because i have like
I'm some senior I need to go to football
games but I never used to like them yeah
my me go to college will get more hey

legging number 12 combat boots or uggs I
like them both from combat the end of
this year Tim there are way more in I
wear them a lot
