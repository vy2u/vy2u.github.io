I'm very excited to do because I love
makeup and going back to the roots of
why I started this channel and so I'm
talking about in the 10 No
I'm talking about the best drugstore
products I didn't get myself a number to
like limit myself to you like five ten
seven twenty you know because I want to
talk about the things that deserve to be
mentioned so these probably haven't
mentioned before on my channel but I
know a lot of people shell good find
good drugstore products some people
think that you know only high-end
products are good but they're definitely
not and there are plenty of dupes at
drugstores for high-end products if you
don't want to spend the money which I
totally understand because why would you
spend $40 on lipstick when you could
spend five so I'm gonna talk about the
best drugstore products in my opinion
that I have researched that I have tried
that I have loved that I've bought and
Reebok so without further ado let's get
started
the first thing I'm gonna talk about is
foundation it's I know a lot of people
have trouble finding foundations that
are good for their skin and that work
with them like I used to have trouble so
so much out spend $30 on foundations not
work as well as these two so the first
one is strictly a foundation it's the
covergirl outlast stay fabulous
foundation
mine is a disaster a mess a dirty
disgusting mess I'm sorry but it's I've
tried many a shades this one in
particular is 8/10 classic ivory it is
it's claims to have a lasting power of
primer coverage of a concealer and blend
ability of a foundation in one this
product let's take this nasty cowboy
it's like the one at the blue cap you
can find it it's about 959 I think it is
at my drugstore ten dollars if you're
gonna you know include tax it's the most
amazing foundation that I have
personally found if you disagree that's
totally fine I don't need you to dislike
this video or comment that you many of
these products that's fine should move
on but there's the best ones that I
found okay moving on I love this
foundation it does not crease at all I
just love this it covers so well at this
bottle lasts for a pretty long time and
I think it's very you know reasonable
it's a bang for your buck and I just
love this foundation so much oh yes
ivory bought this so many times the
coverage is impeccable and it just it
works as well if not way better than any
high-end product you could get at
Sephora or Mac or wherever so yes I love
covergirl outlast stay fabulous so
that's one amazing foundation if you're
struggling to find one that works well
skin anyway next one is foundation kind
of but it's like more would be cream
by Garnier it's their BB cream miracle
skin Perfector and I have the light to
medium the only have two shades slice
medium and medium to dark has a lot of
yellow orange undertones so you know
this is I use this more this summer and
then that foundation in the winter
because my skin's the French shades you
know according to how much the sunlight
it has been exposed to so in the summer
you exposed more Sun then I go with more
orange urks and more tanner anyway make
sure you still blend and don't leave a
harsh light on your neck but I love this
this is almost better than that one I'd
say because it is um it works with any
skin my skin is very combination I have
oily parts and I've stupid right
you know flaky parts it's disgusting but
I do and I feel like everyone's skin is
a little different it covers amazingly
it does not rub off it goes on very wet
and oily looking and slick and greasy
but it totally drives a lot madder than
that and if you said it it will not
smudge at all it is the most beautiful
color it covers like no other literally
this is so hard to find because it's not
in the foundation aisle it's not in the
make a pile of Target Walmart Walgreens
so you have to look in the skincare
aisle where you'd find like Neutrogena
makeup wipes or toners and stuff like
that look in the Garnier skincare aisle
and then that's where this is because
it's better than just to be put in the
makeup foundation aisle it's a skincare
product that just wonders for your skin
while being a great foundation BB cream
giving great coverage I absolutely love
this I have used this for like three
years it's amazing it's my holy grail
foundation I love this one it's a
foundation but this medium is not just a
BB cream it covers like you $100
foundation because McCann's usually
light and kind of see-through and blend
to your skin that does but it does so
much more
so check out going to a BB cream Holy
Grail and has SPF in it I mean so does
this cover girl outlast they both have
SPF of 20 which is great you don't to
worry about sons whom then in your face
does not convert like I want it out in
Florida wish the Sun is so strong and
you know down there and I all I had was
BB cream on totally fine to not get
burnt at all and I used to put tons of
sunscreen on and I'd get so burnt around
out of my eyes and my nose I wore those
you did not convert the next and little
magic concealer I have Maybelline fit me
and this is a total total do for NARS if
you looking for the NARS concealer it's
like the same tube same flow ounce
amount a
works hallo it works so good the only
negative thing I have to say about
Maybelline fit me concealer is that it
goes through really quickly
and it's like six seven dollars which is
kind of expensive for how little
products you get I feel like I'm buying
one of these like every three weeks this
shade in particular is twenty sand sable
holy crap you see me shaking but I have
gone through again many shades of this
I don't really match things watch my
skin I just get it salads good that
one's cute and I pick it up and move on
this gives the absolute best drugstore
concealer coverage you can find in my
opinion I've tried many I've tried this
sponge age rewind by Maybelline I tried
elf I've tried all my I tried Rimmel I
love Maybelline fit me I love all the
fit me line products but the concealer
is just it's right you know it's gonna
be great when you buy it
next I have ELPS matte lip color in rich
red right now on my lips I'm wearing
NARS Cruella lip color I absolutely love
it and this is almost like it it comes
out in like this pointy kind of yeah I
just kind of like pointy skinny little
tip of a lipstick so it is a lipstick
but it's not like the regular lipstick
shape and I love this because it's so
precise and it can be used as a lip
liner or a lipstick in total I love this
I think it's a very very great color in
ls very long it's not a 24 hour or like
a long lasting one but it does last very
long in it's like three dollars from ELF
I don't know if you can still buy this
definitely check online at elfcon but um
yeah I haven't in stores recently yes so
I love this my favorite lipstick from
the drugstore and it's from out which is
the cheapest makeup brand you can really
buy at a drugstore next time at mascara
my favorite has always been Maybelline
great lash lots of lashes but I changed
it to maybelline rocket volume this is
very very very underrated
did not have much promotion when it came
out I mean I do not have any promotion
after it came out but this is my
favorite one it's quite an oldie I feel
like like they've had a lot since then
but this is the brush it's very very
tiny but it can make your lashes super
long my favorite mascara of all time is
better than sex by Too Faced that's not
drugstore because it makes your lashes
so voluminous and your bottom lashes
especially so separated and thick and
this almost does the same as better than
sex so definitely check this one out
it's like five six bucks
so yes maybelline rocket volume is in a
May
using mascara that's my favorite
Maybelline mascara of all time by far
then we have two eyeliners liquid and
pencil pencil
my favorite is Rimmel scandaleyes in the
color up low one black let me show you
it is the wax seeis violence in an
eyeliner here we go look at that look
how dark that is in just two swipes it's
incredible for waterline it stays on a
long time because it is so waxy you
never have to worry about it really
drying out because it doesn't it is
amazing it will last on your waterline a
lot longer than many other ones water
lines are so hard to work with people
always ask me you know how do you get
honor to stay on there you don't mind
falling off right now but one that stays
on for a longer period of time a little
bit longer is Rimmel scandaleyes black
eyeliner the my liquid liner has been
around since I think I started this
channel or like a month after its
Maybelline flying stiletto this liquid
liner I don't know why you wouldn't use
this because it's such a precise little
applicator and it helps you get a
perfect spin line or a stick line or a
perfect cat eye I am NOT a good eyeliner
applicator person but like I suck at
playing I have shaky hand my shits all
over the place all the time
but with this I can get that from the
cat eye and it is a very again vibrant
black color I've been using this this is
kind of gross but like two months I know
that's bad but look how vibrant and how
much color is still left in this tube
you just shake it up and you're ready to
apply it I love it Holy Grail
yes next I have all my face powders so I
have a face powder a bronzer and blush
first and blush okay oh this is just a
random one I picked pink passionate it's
a very pink vibrant color any elf lush
really works great I didn't like how
flushes at first I was confused by them
in the color how to get it like I've
said confused by the pigmentation but I
love it now and that's really the only
blush I will really use I don't use
blush as ever but if I want to go crazy
pink cheeks or use blush I will go with
elf and I have like all of them blushes
and my favorite bronze are in a
drugstore my hair fronts are are you
know chocolate Soleil runs over to face
or hoola bronzer by benefit but if we're
going drugstore drugstore has some
amazing bronzer again by Rimmel it's
coming up a lot Rimmel London and it's
their natural bronzer this one is this
shade
zero to seven Sundance it's one of the
darker ones because I was caner I
usually go with the one called sunshine
though I think it might be zero to two
or something I don't member the exact
number but it's called sunshine when I
usually go with when I am paler pirate
this is the darker one and um I don't
know if you can see that you probably
can't see it but it applies so pigment
and you just need a little bit and it
goes super far I absolutely love this
bronze or if you're looking for a nice
high-quality bronzer go with the Rimmel
one it's about four dollars and it beats
really any other one I haven't seen any
good bronzers from Elle Maybelline
covergirl no bronzer Rimmel so that's
probably I have to share with you is one
of my absolute favorites of all time
and it's a loose powder now when I set
my foundation I use a powder so I don't
get greasy throughout the day and this
is the covergirl one it's the
professional loose powder and this is in
the shade 105 trans isn't fair
so it is a color one oh it's got it
everywhere
the only bad thing about this is it's
very messy and Mackenzie my friend
because he had problem with that she's
like it's kind of messy I was like I
know but it's just so amazing it's my
covergirl I have never ever ever been
shiny I can be sweating my ass off I can
be in the pool and I'm still not shiny
or wet looking because of this powder no
matter what foundation it works well
over top of it I just apply a thick
layer of it just to make sure I don't
get any shiny especially through here
are you really shining through out here
throughout the day but not with this
when I put this on I'm a match creature
throughout the day and I love this I
love this covergirl it's like five
dollars elects forever like look how
much is in there it's a lot for the
price so definitely check out all these
products I love them on my heart or I
would not share them with you I'm not a
person to lie I'm sponsored by
absolutely none of these companies they
don't know why I exist I wish we did put
the don't um so I wouldn't tell you that
I liked him if I didn't really like them
because it wouldn't benefit me anyway I
just want to share these with you
because a lot of people were asking what
are good drugstore foundations and what
are good drugstore products overall so
