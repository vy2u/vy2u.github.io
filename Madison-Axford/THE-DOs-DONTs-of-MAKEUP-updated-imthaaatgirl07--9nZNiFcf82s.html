now sister that wall hey guys so today
I'm excited to do a nother updated do's
and don'ts of makeup this is where once
in my face will be my dues I guess we'll
pick this side for my dues and this is
the makeup don'ts um ok disclaimer
because the video I did of this a year
ago stole it so many mean comments daily
saying you know you don't know what
you're talking about you know this is
all wrong people should be able to do
the makeup however they want obviously
it's a free world so you're gonna do
whatever the hell you want and that's
fine I'm not a makeup artist I'm not a
trained makeup artist in any way shape
or form I love makeup and I love it as
an art form and I think that I've
gradually become a little better at it
than I was when I started my channel
so I've even looked back on past videos
and see what I just like saw what I did
wrong and what I wanted to fix in this
video oh I thought I would just throw
this in there real quick everyone seems
to comment mean things about my and I
don't want to make this out people say
many things about me because I could go
love it like people comment all the time
that you know oh my god calm down your
eyebrows girl um I don't do anything to
my eyebrows at all but I thought I would
take this opportunity why have your
attention to show you and I'm nothing on
my eyebrows and people think that I'm
lying
and then I I fill my eyebrows to the
high heavens and we're rubbing them and
rubbing it and are you ready to see it's
the same friggin eyebrow same eyebrow
see you guys we're commenting it's only
like a few people I love you all but if
we're commenting that my eyebrows are
too big maybe I was born this way so you
need it back oh and let's get start with
do's and don'ts of makeup this said I
face my right so this is going to be my
dues the good things that you should do
want apply makeup in the right things to
do and the left sides gonna be mud
outside mainly because I have this
Hoggins it above my lip the first thing
I'm going to start out with is
moisturizing my right side my face
because that is definitely do for me at
least before I put on any makeup with
any moisturizer right now I'm using my
ultra Repair Cream but I first aid
beauty it just hydrates my skin my skin
is very dry in some certain areas it
makes it easier when I apply foundation
later when my skin's already has like a
dewy um finish on it okay I don't know
why I did without here that was very
awkward we have any some Beauty Blender
to apply my makeup like always I just
watched it even though it still looks
dirty
don't worry I do clean myself or my do
side I'm going to use a BB cream this is
just lighter and then I'm just going to
stipple it on I want to UM even out my
skin tone I have so much red and purple
in my skin tone and put a little on your
lip so you don have any harsh you know
white lines around your mouth that's
always awful and nice to deal with that
quite often blended back into your ear
and sweep it out just so you don't have
any discoloration and then a little done
your neck for my don't side I'm going
with a foundation that's much darker my
skin tone
now I'm going to go in with concealer on
my do side I'm taking fit me consider
which I love and most out of it the way
that um you'll be more successful with
your concealer application process is if
you put it in lines under your eyes this
way it looks like you highlighted and
concealed rather than just put it
directly on your under eye like socket
this way it goes down always your cheeks
and up to your temples and it all blends
in I love this age rewind concealer as
well but I'm going to use this for the
don't side do not just put it under a
circle like that I see so many people
doing this and it will not look good in
the end because if you blend it you can
totally see where like the lighter
concealer is rather than like this it
goes up and it's like a natural
highlight as you can see that I
definitely put it in like a circle under
my eye next thing that's very important
is cutting your foundation in your
concealer in total I'm using this
ratchet covergirl powder it's amazing
powder but it's magic since all cracked
it's my fault it's the professional
loose powder just gonna tap it out into
the into the lid and I'm going to take
my hair brushes ever which is the elf
brush what it's a small tapered brush
this is perfect for my eye region and
I'm gonna do side I'm going to just
fluff this all over and put this on also
set the rest of your face makeup I
literally if you look in old videos or
makeup videos and just own videos in
general oh this is elf brush as well
anyway if you look at home videos when
like the boyfriend does my makeup tag
that I did with Nick my friend a long
time ago he's like where's your powder
and I was like I don't use powder I just
use bronzer he was like like he knew
more about microphone I did I was just
like it's fine
no you need to set it just so you don't
become a greasy mess through the day
contouring this is a huge mistake that I
made over and over and over and over and
over again at homecoming from graduation
whatever I'm using Too Faced chocolate
Soleil bronzer it's from one of my
staple bronzers I love this and what I'm
going to do is just take a big fluffy
blending brush to do my bronzer because
I wanted to look natural rather than a
harsh line but you know if you want to
go both avant-garde harsh line do that
you know go rock you um but I mean this
is the most natural way to do bronzer
and contouring from me at least some she
can take this Real Techniques powder
brush and just dab on some of the
bronzer and I'm just gonna I have a
natural contour I feel like a lot of
people do if
I don't have any confirmation right now
bacon Oh see it's right from like the
top of your ear almost no no the top of
your ear like the top of your ear this
connected your head so just down point
it down to your mouth you can see that
I'm going to take this and draw it down
and then just blend it in so you do get
that nice contoured line which is like
you're altering your cheekbone
artificially but it's not super harsh
it's all kind of blended in the end it
goes right along top my natural contour
which I love don't paint a beard on I
used to do that I used to paint it all
this bronze around here I span it in
here no don't do that also if you have a
big forehead like me get towards the end
of your eyebrow if you have a big
forehead you're going to want to put a
lot of runs ER there as a corner your
head and then blend out the shading just
gives like a depth to your forehead it
makes it look like a shadow rather than
like your actual forehead so it makes it
look smaller blend it into your hairline
so this side is very very contoured it's
gonna look very off and very orange
right here because I did do it to the
other side it would be all even but the
size of the domed side it's going to
look like I'm very orange on my forehead
but if it was evened out and you know I
had contoured my nose in this temple and
this cheek and this neck it would look
all grand great grand terrific but since
I only did one side it's gonna look a
little top-heavy on this side anyway on
this side I'm going to take this brush
which is great if you know how to work
properly this is what I used to do no
joke not trying to be funny but I would
put my bronze around almost to my mouth
and then continue to put more layers on
top I did this for literally homecoming
prom everything and this looks bad and
it looks like I have the sideburns or
something I wouldn't leave it like that
I wouldn't blend it but there's always
so much blending you can do and it's
still a super thick line so this is
literally what I wore to prom and
everything it will have natural this
looks now even you thought this was a
lot no this looks good this is I swear
to god this is what I did every single
day until like a few months ago when I
was like oh my god that marker on my
face or bronzer made that mistake so
many times
next we're gonna do blush taking my it
brushes by Ulta blush brush and I'm
going to show you where to apply the
brush your blush I'm just going to dab
on a little bit and cap it off and then
you
smile and put it right above where you
put the bronzer on on the apples of your
cheeks I'm a little actually like right
to the up of your cheek you put it right
on the dot you're gonna look like the
clown and I go very very light hand on
the blush because I don't want to look
like I have a fever and I already have
natural red cheeks hidden under all its
makeup so why am I putting more red
cheeks on top and I just try to hide it
off I've seen so many people put so much
blush on and it does look like they are
sick um if you can rock this go ahead I
used to think I could rock galaxy
leggings I couldn't next we're gonna
move on to eyebrows like I said I don't
do a lot to my eyebrows well no I don't
do anything to my hours except combing
them and maybe put a little gel on them
so now I'm just gonna comb through this
one boom down so we don't go crazy if
you're gonna film your eyebrows make
sure you do very sparse filling in right
here I used to try to make this super
black but it is so if you want to look
more natural you are gonna want this to
be a little more sparse and this be
darker so just you don't want to fill us
in it really big I see a lot of people
have this super pointy line eye this is
something I wouldn't do per se
don't like don't pretend like you
haven't seen this before because I know
you've seen this before burr okay now if
you think this looks good that's up to
you
I don't think it looks good it kind of
looks like I have a square root sign on
my head
the next thing I do is I'm going to jump
to lips actually because my lips look
like I'm a corpse to work I'm gonna go
with a nude kind of theme today for my
lips and on my doubt side I'm taking a
lipstick that's totally fine but I'm
just putting nude on and as you can see
I'm half my lips it looks like I'm dead
like it looks like I have no color on my
lips it looks like it blends in it looks
like a concealer foundation still left
over my lips now the way I found that's
the most like successful when doing your
lipstick is to put on this is myth by
Mac put it on again looks like concealer
so I'm just gonna put an angel by MAC
lipstick over it because by adding a
little pink hue to it it's still that
nude color if it gives you a little
color to your lips and looks like you
something on your lips rather than just
concealer now this is not necessarily a
don't if you like liquid eyeshadow
primers that's totally up to you I don't
really like them because they're very
they don't work as well to me as Paint
Pots do but I'm just taking shadow
insurance by Too Faced which is quite
watery and I'm putting it on my don't
side lid which is creasing like a mother
because it's a dense image and I'm
putting this all over my eyelid up to my
brow to prepare for the shadows I'll use
and look how what this is like I used to
use this all the time like look how
greasy that is mmm
Emma on my new side I'm using my
favorite eyeshadow primer which is a
Paint Pot by Mac it's painterly this is
just the most basic nude color you can
use on the tons of other ones I love and
I have but I like using this one the
best and this is just like a clay it's
kind of based like a clay I just love it
it's so like it gives great coverage if
you have like really obvious veins on
your eyelid but anyway this just helps
the shadows be so much more vibrant and
stay so much longer you can take any
eyeshadow you freakin won - the key to
doing a smoky eye is making sure you
have a transition color a lid color and
a base color so the transition Clark is
usually just a light brown any like
brown shade that you like to use that's
a very natural neutral color I'm
actually going to start with my naked 1
palette in the shade here go the shade
 she's a nice light brown just um to
get a nice transition color and help the
shows that I put on later see it out
more
it's just defines the crease more before
you can on any other smokey eye color in
the crease I'm just going to use virgin
which is the first very white ivory
pearl Aztec color um in the palette as
my overall lid shadow because when
you're doing a smoky eye you don't want
a super dark color because then you will
not see the crease and there will be no
smoky eye it'll just be one big gray
area and then I'm going to take a mix of
toasted and hustle to make a nice Auburn
grayish color and this crease I don't
wanna go super heavy sometimes I do like
a dark navy or black and it makes my
eyes look super smaller than they are
anyway on this side we're gonna do a
smoky eye as well but I'm going to start
with like a darker brown color I'm not
gonna do transition shade to begin with
I'm just gonna start with a darker brown
color as my base color kiss is what I
used to think I was like oh I can do a
brown and then a black in the crease and
then will look amazing no cuz this color
is way way way too dark for a lip color
cuz this one guy's not gonna pop then
it's just gonna look like one big dark
hole I'm she can take my black color
which I always thought how to be smokey
eye some okay I tattoo black no they
don't and if you put this in your crease
you can see that this just looks kind of
messy but yeah it doesn't look as good
as this side I think this is a very
subtle smokey I like some people mine I
haven't considered a smoky eye but is
very blended and this one is just kind
of like I was really trying to do a
smoky eye if you couldn't tell you can
tightline and waterline if you want I
always do because I think it makes me
look just look prettier I know that may
seem like seem conceited but I honestly
think I look better with it done I don't
do it every day because it kind of
irritates my contacts sometimes I don't
want to do this or if you can if this
hurts your eyes don't do it but there's
my waterline and tightline just slip
helps everything blend in you know with
your eyeliner in your eyelashes I'm
going to take my favorite liquid
eyeliner I never use pencil on the top
because it'll melt away if you sweat or
if any moisture and the air gets on your
eyes or your eyelids it will like melt
away so I like to use a liquid eyeliner
you need to let it dry for a few seconds
but it will look better in the end so I
will use pencil on the don't side but on
the do side I'm gonna use my favorite
liquid eyeliner you can pull this if you
want yeah it may cause premature
wrinkles or lines but it does help you
in the end get a straighter line I
always say don't pull and I would try my
best not to but it's sometimes you just
get okay I just messed it up
okay so it's super sick on eyeliner
today but that's because I missed oh I
got nervous on camera
so not awful but it just doesn't have
the same in your face kind of BAM look
liquid does this is just kind of more
natural doesn't scan out to me then it
just wakes the whole dark so yeah look
even darker I never crawl my lashes I
think that really damages your lashes
and I don't find me to because if we
find the right uplifting and you know
amazing voluminous mascara you don't
necessarily need to call your lashes I
mean I just don't like it I'm taking a
Maybelline is record volume Express it's
kind of an oldie but a grady because
it's a love of mine I'm just gonna go
with this like back and forth kind of
wiper motion you know all the way to the
inner corner to the outer very less lash
and try to get in there in your lid if
you do just wait until it dries then get
a q-tip and get it off if any gets up
here I'm trying my best to have a steady
hand and not do that today even though
that happens everyday then um I'm bottom
lashes you're going to wiper motions
again and kind of separate them make
them clumpy and then separate them that
makes sense to give them together really
dark and then separate them with a brush
I think if you Julia
lower lashes correctly Polly caught by
the family I mean my eyes are watering
like a mother if you do your bottom
lashes correctly they can add so much
more glamour to a look and make it you
look so much more like Oh God I love
better than sex by two-faced mascara but
this one's really old and dried out so
I'm showing you don't use the old and
dried out one because you won't get the
same result as a new bottle of this
anyway so I'm just gonna go like up and
down and not use one wiper motions and
still this mess gear is so amazing it
still gets pretty good result but
nothing like amazing nothing really
sticks out it doesn't look like you have
falsies on or anything which is kind of
my goal here you can see those you can't
see these and we're not doing more live
emotions I'm just brushing up through
and if you don't do that on the bottom
and you do this they're not going to
stick out at all then it looks like I
think I played nothing to the side and
we are done ladies and gentlemen so I
look crazy but no I do think this I
genuinely looks good this is how I do my
makeup and so I hope that I like how I'm
doing my makeup otherwise there's
something a little wrong there I hope
you enjoyed this video hope it helped in
some way I do videos and YouTube for a
reason that's to share my tips

viewfinder a lot to make sure that I'm
in focus
