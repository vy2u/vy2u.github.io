excited to do this unboxing video for
you however so yeah it's just the
beautycon box and this month is like

unlike anything i've ever had or done
before they're extremely well known high
quality products and i'm excited to open

I figure is this little cautious of
bunny so okay and then it tells its prey
sensuous and it tells you everything
that's in the bag so let's just open
this there's like little babies on the
rat first so cute oh bleh okay first
thing I see is music Garnier's inactive

excited to try something new and try
this new box so yeah I need saying no in
my life and here it is next we have oh
my god doing Beauty blenders little
beauty blenders the original be a butter
micro mini so there's the two mini ones
I think these are might be used for like
contouring or under eye because they
will get bigger then it is shown here
like if you don't know if you guys are
through the amazing makeup applying
sponges and so this is how it comes I
think it might get maybe like this thing
because wants to maybe like that cuz
once water hits it will grow and fit
perfectly on your eye and for contouring
this awesome I've always wanted to get
the little one but I didn't know exactly
what I'll use them for and now that I
caught them I'll find something to you
since I love beauty butter try to true
favorite way to apply makeup then we
have oh my god a glam glow face mask
outside because this is amazing okay yup
this is the youth mud tingle exfoliate
treatment this is amazing oh it's like
the brown one smells so good if you can
see that it's the brown grey one I'm so
excited to try this always want a global
mask their seventy dollars so i was like
Marketo fast for now but i'm so excited
that beauty content provided me with it
okay I have a mirror essential seed a
moisturizer broad-spectrum SPF 30 so
what's the moisturizer with SPF in it
that's great I don't use moisturizers so
this is I knew that I have never tried
before I don't use moisturizers primers
and anything that's we have sunscreen um
under my makeup so that's kind of bad
and I need to start using the sign like
this so awesome i can try it yay travel
size they're real by benefit i really do
like they're real i'm using the bigger
size right now but it's just a little
travel-size my mom has one of these are

it's the full brush size but a lot of
mini who I could put this in at my
shadow I love this boss NYX matte finish
long-lasting setting spray a light
weight water based setting spray the
case your makeup looking mat and amazing
through any kind of weather that's
awesome I didn't even know next hat I
knew that l'oreal came out with one but
i didn't know Nick's came out with a
finish spray let's see what it's like
okay it's very wet I can feel that um
but it is a matte finish so i think it
will dry finish but I'm used to having
like standin avia which is a little more
dryer I do like this so it's very
hydrating next IC power of love natural
lipstick Pacifica I've never heard of
this brand so let's open it on up to the
shade sweet one powerful color natural
lipstick okay so is like a brown color
okay okay i don't know how i use it as
much because i don't like that color
super much like a brown maroney but it's
a cute packaging with all the hearts i
love that that's cute okay um it's
blendable too creamy doesn't the best
smell but you know we can deal we can do
next i have the rock nudes mainly pal oh
my god those swatches of these okay come
so close like little applicators that I
hate trash um oh what okay these colors
are definitely buildable and you will
need to build them because some of them
are transparent but some of them are
extremely pigmented and I'm living oh ok
yes you need to build them but that
black that I just watch is so like yes
like it's creamy and it's not super like
in your face but it is a buildable yet
blendable black and I love that kind of
like a charcoal actually this is so
beautiful i love that it's like all
darks kind of yeah the rock nudes so
it's like rock and roll dark and that's
so cool I don't just got a freaking
palette awesome right next we got a
little bunny keychain which we know her
she loves using antique things so they
give us like this little creepy doll
keychain which I'm kind of slightly
living for so I will most likely put
soma keys and scare everyone that I walk
past with there's these instant nail
fashion I don't like now thanks i buy
one use these but they're like creepy
dolls again I guess money um it's cool
it's cool i just don't think i will use
these

these kind of wanted to holders there
