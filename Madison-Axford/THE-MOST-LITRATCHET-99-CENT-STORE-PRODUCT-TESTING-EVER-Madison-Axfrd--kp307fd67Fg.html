store haul I haven't done one of these
in forever but I'm very excited to do it
you guys always love when I do these to
a thank you for that and for requesting
this and so I thought I would bring
another one to you today is that without
further ado let's he started so the
first thing that I got are these Hannah
Montana girl won't hold on when was this
created 2008 2008 the dollar was heavy
since 2008 and so they're decorative
wall decals so I'm actually I put this
on my wall it says that it is um easy to
apply and easy to remove so if I can't
remove this I'm going to sue wonder
sticks Hannah Montana wall decks okay
which one this one when she's confused
or this one where she's a sassy Queen
sassy queen girl oh they were she should
go sure here no that's not it right here
oh oh you can't see her here should you
on this side
BAM I love it that's amazing um but how
much I was just like my all day
every day got home from school Hannah
Montana Irish head I was Hannah Montana
it was great okay so I got this baby
Oh what was his head what is it girl oh
this is the front and it's head is like
crook'd okay and also why does his arms
like this like to the back and why is it
so broad and why does it have man hands
there's so many question they have on
this why is it wearing a onesie that's
like split why is it giving a thumbs up
do you think it was a sucking it's not
but it doesn't fit into its mouth and
why is the back of it like whipped this
maybe has been through a lot and so I
adopted it today my favorite part is the
head and like this clear like wire
around its neck um I think it's very sad
but it needed a home so I got it then I
got this little pup pup dog toy and I
thought this was adorable like it says
pop I'm pretty sure pop doesn't like
fizz like this and you don't drink it
out of a beer glass I'm pretty sure this
is beer and most ox won't make it to age
21 so illegal drinking dogs I'm living
so I'm gonna see if my dog likes this it
all likes nothing so she probably won't
but like just no dog that I bought a toy
for you so let's go try this out
did you joy good joy come on display
good why would you play with the toy
remote it's a toy I got it for you
literally does not give two next I
got this bib okay I got two bids but
first I need to ask you what this says
okay so it's a zebra okay and it says I
am charm not I am charmed not I am a
charm
I am charm I don't understand even
proper that's not a proper sentence but
again I felt bad because no one would be
like shopping for the new kid newborn
baby and be like I am charm yes young
child Oh like the creator of this I feel
bad I don't know how I do got through
and got like produced onto a bit less
than the other bit I got I had a
question about this one as well it says
little misbehaving me but like what what
is that I've had different answers so
one thought it was a lamb or sheep
someone thought it was a flower and
someone thought it was a cloud I also
thought it was a cloud I don't know I
don't know what this is what is this
what is that it's a blob it's literally
an amoeba angel of mine you need some
better ideas this is no the graphics and
the images and the lettering and the
sentence structure of these are just not
good like c- quality oh then I got these
I thought these were mittens now that I
look back I'm like how did I think that
like whose fingers are this long but
like we just try it as a glove real
quick yes no fingers okay hmm okay my
toes are like small and they don't even
fit these holes oh oh oh I hate this it
was like elastic in each toe so that
your toes don't like fall out but
they're like suffocating my toes okay
hold on oh okay oh oh what what are
those okay um I went by these again it
was a dollar so no K they're warm
they're fuzzy socks they're probably
still be slightly all fun on like
hardwood floor but like the same with
these is
like I said there's a lesson each toe
and my toes aren't like abnormally big
and so they're still being like squeezed
so I feel like any adult or anyone with
like a big sized toe is gonna feel like
their toes are like being cut off
circulation
I'm putting the other one on and I'm
going to wear these dress in the videos
so sway I do like the colors oh and they
look at cotton candy and um yes next I
got these glasses that were in the
Halloween aisle and I'm very confused
okay so novelty glasses three-plus I
don't know what three-year-olds gonna be
rocking these huge s glasses but what I
was confused about is they're like the
Halloween ones right so they have um
eyelashes on them like Oh cute but I
want to know who the fuck's eyelashes
are way up here and I know these aren't
suppose to be eyebrows I bought these I
was very intrigued by the eyelashes
people are now more accepting of giant
spider lashes but at the same time they
placed them in the eyebrow region and
I'm just very concerned for this person
and where they think eyelashes are
located this samurai sword
I got good know what I needed karaoke
for this oh my god it's ro oh my god
when I asked okay no I wasn't in it
that's right one more time let's get
down to business to defeat the Huns yep
but on fire wisten once you find your
Center you are Sean - wait
we got to do the voices what I'm never
gonna catch my breath say goodbye to
those who know me we're gonna always go
for cutting J these Gaskins kids death
hope he doesn't see right through me now
I really wish that I knew how to swim
with God the Folsom great oh my god okay
and we're gonna so I got this book
called space so the reason behind that
is last year and this is actually kind
of a good congratulations to me thing so
I used to have really bad anxiety I'm
not saying I'm cured I'm not saying I'm
over anxiety but I never saw anyone for
it I never took medicine for it was his
self talking through way of achieving a
little more calm of a nature and and so
I'm very very proud with my
accomplishments and with my growth and
within my anxiety within my life so this
is Emily ago Joe Madison flight not
being super scared not having as many if
any panic attacks anymore but last year
or no two years ago I don't know it got
really bad and I would I thought about
having to go to the moon and I got a
panic attack like I got if I'm not
trying to be funny I got a full-on panic
attack before I went to restaurant like
because I totally but I had to go to the
moon like that just oh my god like I
don't like flying so that would just be
like going to space and Madison don't
mix so I got this book is kind of like a
congratulations you can now read about
the moon and not freak out um and yeah
like you can read about all this kind of
stuff like how did the Milky Way get its
name
um because spilt milk across the sky but
she didn't know that okay next I got a
you already had Christmas stock I said
like they had Halloween I only got those
glasses because he did have really good
Halloween stuff but they had this tons
of Christmas operations out including
this Rudolph nose so it's called a
light-up nose okay oh wait this looks so
stupid who would wear this out I look
like oh my God look at this already
we're after it note reindeer had a very
shiny nose
Oh see the strings too like this one no
it gives away the illusion dollar store
it like you could see that the know what
WWE Superstar sticker book oh this was a
dollar for Twitter plus two girs Oh
random ass people I don't know but if
you do Congrats see this guy is kind of
scary so I'm gonna take him and put him
on my face okay oh I fell he doesn't
stick to makeup okay here we go look and
then you can go to school and be like or
if you're like more of a classy type
okay you don't want to put it on your
face you just find one is this John Cena
oh it's John's shirt oh right there next
I got this which is really cool it's a
knit bulb inside with a little movable
clock so what I thought was do I run in
business I know um what I thought about
this was aware necklace right get a
point to holder or something that can
connect it to like a necklace okay so
then you do that's the sort of tie thing
and then it's part of your necklace so
what my thought was was when a basic ass
hoe tries to come up and talk to you or
you're at a bar and some ratchet as do
comes up you're like and then he tries
to talk to you or she tries to say
something and you're like and you don't
respond because you're what closed I'm
not open for conversation okay I got
time for you I'm not trying to talk to
you I don't want your number and you're
not gonna get mine and if you have
something to say about me like this
bitch trying to say say about me the
other day I say I could say for you I'm
closed and I'm not open till I'm away
from you okay I got these scented pens

pissed because it says light blue is
mint red strawberry purple gray green
watermelon orange orange and pink is
bubblegum so brios you know where i

you're like I know green is watermelon

I'll take it and then we have orange
which smells like orange well creative
