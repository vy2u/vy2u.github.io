um we are doing kind of the story of us
it's kinda like a draw my life but we're
talking our lives because word I I don't
I'm not a good drawer so what I'm gonna
do that drama knife was out like four
years ago things nothing are so we're
doing to talk my life because I thought
we'd share the story of us we're not
dating
and people are confused about our
relationship and how someone could be
such good friends without dating and I
feel like you have to go kind of through
the stage of liking each other to get to
where we are like we've gone through the
awkward moments we've got their fights
so I want to share that with you in a
brief little synopsis of our life our
story our story of us throughout four
years of high school I met freshman year
and into our first year of college so
without further ado we'll kind of give
you a brief little summary of each year
let's murder it with that further ado
let's get started okay so we're starting
the freshman year I was 14
you were 14 to 14 and we were in mrs.
hall's biology class yes those no only
class were together right yeah okay so
and we have nine practices and all this
is what I yeah that's me yeah it'll be
kind of boring unless you like actually
interested so I hope you like um so
we're miles across and it was like
towards the end of first semester things
we didn't really talk yeah this was like
October and she was in a play Romeo and
Juliet I was a Montague citizen boom
which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio
till a bat murderer which way ran he was
good missed I remembered it so anything
anyway Madison was in it and I think I
was like weird mood or something cuz I
had seen her and I think she was like
really excited or really hyper or
something and I know well yes but I was
so excited this is the thing well I
didn't have a crush on him per se but I
saw another gonna love me but I did I
thought this other girl
and even if I didn't really like him yet
like I did a little bit later but I
didn't get I was like oh no this is
gonna be my friend I'm near like this
person and you can't like if jealous
like 14 year old so I went under table
and by other table it wasn't even the
tail I was sitting at this this other
girl and him are saying yeah I just let
me crawl under it's like I walked under
icon to this table and came up by Jeff's
like legs and he was like when I say to
you I remember I told you about my knees
stories right
oh yeah so like a fat person sat on her
knee when she was like younger and she
like randomly just started telling me
her life story about her knee problems
like that was our first encounter what's
me being like hi guess what I brought me
tea before I mean these are really
wrapped you in they always fall and I
like on a treadmill
I like the layers with skin and then I
think I got a face book me like I can
tell you more of my nice - oh yes I'm
gonna insert all the messages here on my
own Facebook um yeah good god okay so I
used to be the worst flirter know and
then like a few weeks later or like a
day later I don't remember but that I
liked with my hair the woman I think I
was I playing put my hair out loud oh
really
no I'm just singing it yeah she was just
singing it and I was like oh man I had a
point feeling that's like oh man thank
you point that way and Jeff mr16 it's
back back on they way they don't like
the clock las clases de like I already
go home yeah and then he looks I mean
they're just all kind of like and I was
like oh my and you know the whole house
is pretty like that's why he like two
friends high school career but like so
that happened and we get in casual
fights here and there because I would
think that what he was saying was like
mean it was like joking it was stupid
but it wasn't us 15 or boy 14 whatever
hell yes second semester second semester
and I liked her so I think that's my way
of flirting was just like Saint stupid
stuff I told her about it for April
Fool's she'd be pretty like kiss for
like a month like I swear we didn't
spend much I was like
I never lived I was like remember yes
and then one day I guess this is also
his technique of flirting he was like oh
you're here tomorrow
and we're your cash in t-shirt I'll be
five dollars and he didn't think I'd do
it and I came to school like say the
girls I'm sure tons like I was gonna use
it to pay $40 for it I didn't go to the
concert happens to be here these biology
pictures happen it was like we're not
like doing a hangout we took pictures
last night school I feel like we're best
friends and then but we really do much
fun right here yeah okay didn't talk it
all that summer I don't think we got one
we did not talk it all sophomore year
like maybe high in hallways did we ever
try to see each other no knows I'm sorry
the counters in the hallways
that's when you start your video that's
why I liked her a lot and she didn't and
then like you said this girl down the
hallway to see how I acted remember
marrow experiment like we talked to see
if I liked him back well one that was
crazy
and so like she and then she'd be like
oh yeah I don't think she likes you
doesn't we really weren't friends who
really weren't not we weren't mad
actually we weren't a fight we just do
to talk or communicate I had my locker
by Odessa McKenzie and we didn't so that
was a great fun year junior year started
out we were either b-boy I say really
good friends because we had a lot of
classes with her three like we I don't
know how happened but I juiced we own a
lot fights but we weren't really good
friends and so we wasn't a joke that our
government teacher would think we're
like bipolar because half the time I
walk in a new day a minute of this pens
and then the other half of the time we
were like you wouldn't talk to Aaron and
I wouldn't if I might I be pissed I
walked in without hand I was like and I
don't mean to say bipolar and like a bad
way Joe feel like all sets and middle
just order believe me we both have
mental disorders we get it we were
literally friends like half the time I
didn't like her then at that point and I
even I came up with my life freshman
year he liked a different girl Maddie
I'm sorry I forgot so I was dating
someone from first semester and part of
her first semester of junior
so we were some friends and there was
like a little more normal in a way but
it was also I don't know we still had
fights in between them because I
remember everybody I also try to be a
little more distant but because he was
dating someone but I wasn't like that
was a thing I feel like that was a big
problem was like I'm I'm we're both
friends with the girl now but at the
time I feel like she thought I was
trying to like yeah I thought you do
clingy like everyone was all over the
place
but really it's like I didn't want to
stop the offense with him a little even
a little bit because he was dating
someone and it just kind of clashed but
while that was still going on like I
would just we would just give little
fights all the time and like one time
you were like do you like cuz he I said
talking about like how I didn't want
kids there's something I know and then
he was like I was like oh I can't wait
to have a I'm gonna name at this or like
oh that kids really key I think little
kids are walking by because we're
walking by like they had the preschool
coming up and then I said hey do you
want to kids I don't know why no no no
you were because I said I said all those
cuz he really cute like that
I'm excited have kids I mean yeah I'm
saying then you're like oh you want kids
yeah oh you know you were like oh you
and kid um cuz like he thought I had
previously said I didn't I got so mad
and she was pissed for like three days
and would you be lunch together this was
part weed and the library thankfully
never ends we're friends at least not I
don't want scheduled and then okay I
remember Mackenzie what was there and I
was like I know you probably got up and
left or something I don't remember I got
mad but like oh my god overreacting yeah
like major so anyway that happened I'm
just like little things like that but I
don't know why we were so second
semester
oh my god no then in December I was
trying to get a job at Brighton and one
of his friends really didn't want me
working there because he doesn't like
Madison he just didn't like me in
particular because I was fencing Jeff
and you kind of thought I was like
taking him away from Jeff like they were
best friends then I was kinda like
in the picture now and I didn't mean for
it to be like that but we were just
really good friends and so he went to
break co2 and I was trying to get a job
at bread Co in a family he went there
and do you recommended me to one of the
managers I saw get hired but um and so I
was like one night he was like I'm gonna
go into your I commend you again and
Jeff was with him I was like Jeff
don't you dare for the Brightcove like I
was gone well so I was with my friends
their bread coat and she went which I
don't know if he's had any I don't even
remember I think yeah from what he said
anything I don't think he did at that
point I wasn't even I texted him inter
Clint now somewhere and I was like so

something I was like I was like I was a
bright girl Jill I love my said I was

really talking in a weird voice a little
miscommunication a weird voice I was

it was like I thought he was talking
about my voice and I was like I don't
