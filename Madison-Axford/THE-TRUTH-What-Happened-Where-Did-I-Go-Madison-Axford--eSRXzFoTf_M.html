I don't even remember the last time
actually film filmed and not like
pre-recorded um my last video that I
posted was over a month ago is that I
think August 15 two days before my
birthday that I turned 20 and I I know
what I want to address in this video but
I don't know how to say it um I want to
start off by telling you what happened
where did I go what is going on with
Madison because she just fell off the
planet um I didn't though because if you
follow me on Twitter Instagram and it
kept up with me you would see that I'm
alive and I'm doing well and doing great
nothing happened like drastic or bad but
definitely follow me on my social media
I really need your guys's help in
increasing my number count on those
because a lot of companies will be like
why don't you people follow you on
Instagram or Twitter and I don't know
why so if you could follow me at Madison
AXIRON both that would be wonderful and
you can keep up in case a break like
this does happen again you know that I'm
not dead there's nothing wrong I'm still
posting I'm living my life and I'm you
can see that on my Twitter and Instagram
so make sure you follow me on there and
mean the world to me but I didn't plan
on taking a break I've never really took
a break from YouTube ever longer than
maybe two or three weeks and this has
been going on five I think at this point
and so I did not plan on August 15th
when I posted my last reaction - don't
judge me challenge video I never planned
on stopping or taking a break I didn't
think I needed to
and that wasn't in the cards for me at
the time but I was moving into my
apartment that I live at now yes I'm at
home right now cuz it's like I'm on a
weekend break that I just came home for
because I was like I need a film I want
peace and quiet I wanted my background
and he grocery so I'm gonna go home and
get all that stuff done and then go back
down to my home that I live at now I
just will be coming it's my apartment
tour which I adore it I love my
apartment it's great and that will be
coming shortly but I was moving in there
so much was happening with like you know
rent gettin rent solved and getting um
all moved in boxes boxes of stuff and
moving in my furniture and all this crap
was happening right before school
started I moved in everything is set
everything was good my mom helped me a
ton moving all my stuff in
she hooks up my cable box like
everything was good and everything still
is good and if you don't know I am in
college I'm a full-time college student
I'm taking 17 credit hours right now and
the maximum we can take is 18 so I'm
taking a lot of credit hours which means
that I have homework every night I have
a least four papers to write a week
because I'm in running intensive classes
right now and I'm not making excuses for
myself I'm just giving you reasons for
why I took such a long break because
like I said it wasn't planned it just
kind of happened that way but yes my
classes are a very very heavy load
currently and I'm partaking a lot more
than organization that I'm involved in
and I'm just living I'm living my life
I'm hanging out and making connections
with friends so much deeper than I've
ever made a connection before with
people I'm going out and meeting new
people I'm not drinking I don't do drugs
still I would not I've never changed my
morals and my personality to fit in
That's not me and that's not what I
stand for but I'm going out having fun
and being myself and it's been the most
encouraging and happy thing that I've
done it in a while if you know me I've
been through a lot of crap in high
school I was bullied I was made fun of I
didn't have that many friends I was kind
of an outcast because I did YouTube and
and I wouldn't trade that for a world
like I'm glad I did it I'm glad I was so
confident with myself at such a young
age but that was that part of my life so
it wasn't a super amazing time then I
went to Mizzou my freshman year college
and that was such an unhappy point in my
life that I transferred and now my first
year at my new university like was okay
I know a lot of people I didn't know I
made my major I like a lot of sub was
just up in the air I didn't have a good
housing situation down by my university
so I'm come home lots of film and all
that jazz but now like well I'm a junior
in college I have never ever ever been
so happy in my life
so you don't need to worry about me I
can make sure I'm okay because I'm
genuinely just grown so much as a person
over these past year or this past few
months and just really succeeded in the
area of personal development and growth
and I'm like so happy and thankful that
I'm finally at a place that I can say I
love myself like I love being me and
that sounds so so stupid cliche I know
but I'm just so confident and nothing
really can tear me down or make me sad
because I'm just so I Know Who I am
I know what I stand for and I know what
I want to do with my life but like I
said you'll see
just my Instagram like me going to a bar
or me going out at night and you
probably like why could you make a video
then and that is true but down at my
apartment I don't have studio lighting
because of space issues like I could
bring it down but it would be really
crowded and I just I would rely on
natural light when I fell down there
which I will start doing but like I said
I have classes till 5:00 almost every
day and then the Sun sets in about an
hour or two and I'm with friends I'm
doing homework so then YouTube was put
on the back burner and I apologized for
that and it was unintentional but that
happened and then at night people were
like well if you're going out all the
time but I did it and you must drink
down all this stuff no I will not drink
in time Lele the age of 21 I have not
drink yet and I will not until then but
I can't film at night because I don't
have studio lights and I know I didn't
give you guys that warning I tell you
why that was happening but that's why
there's been a lack of videos but you
see me doing stuff because people were
getting very offended and mad at me for
going out and enjoying myself and making
bonds with people when I should be
filming videos they say and and thank
you for supporting me thank you for
wanting the videos of mine that is
incredible thank you guys for even
worrying about me I don't want you to
ever feel like something is happening to
me or worry about me but thank you guys
for caring so much and wanting new
content from me but I have been so just
genuinely happy for once now that I
wasn't happy before but you know
everyone has their shitty days but now
it's like I'm just like keep going
gotta keep going like living life live
learn love laughter it's great then
there had such a close to group of
friends and yeah so I don't want you
guys to be like oh sorry we have summer
videos work no no thank you for asking
that I don't want you guys to get mad at
me I had a little a few people threaten
me that they would unsubscribe like
that's fine if you feel like you need to
unsubscribe because I took a month off
to live my life and go to college I'm
sorry
like unsubscribe then because new
content is coming I would never just
leave you two forever and not give a
reason and like I said I would have
given a hey guys I'm going on a break if
I knew that was gonna happen but the
weeks just kept passing by and then
we're going by so fast because I was
enjoying myself and having fun that I
didn't even realize and that sounds bad
on my part
but I mean it's not a character flaw I
was just living my life for once which
I've never done because I've always done
it in fear and inward because I do have
anxiety but that's another thing that's
gotten a lot better and my
completely cured no I don't think I'll
ever be because you can't just get rid
of something like anxiety but I've never
gone on prescription pills I've never
seen anyone like a therapist I've just
mentally talked myself through it and
made myself more strong and confident
which is another thing I'm super proud
of I've been doing things this year that
I never thought I could be able to or
would be able to and I've done them
successfully because I don't I don't
know what came over me but it's just
like I realized that you I get one
chance to live so just go for it you
might be nervous you might be worried
but just try and that's what I started
to do more because I would be so worried
to even go out to a restaurant with
friends or walk around a mall that you
still worry me like a few years ago and
now I can do that without any question
and I feel more and more like a normal
teenager everyday which is like
incredible because you guys know I've
been through so everything is
really amazing in my life right now and
I don't really bright like anything so
good but for me I've worked my ass off
to get to where I am in life to
confidently be myself and this just
proves that no matter what anyone has to
say about you or what you've been
through I've been through crap in the
past I've been through in the past
but you can get through it and you can
be strong know that you have one chance
to live your life so live it to the best
of your ability think the best you can
be because you only get this one shot
you could die at any moment not to make
this like grim and sad but you could and
so yes I may have anxiety and yes
sometimes I may worry more than others
or too much and I may live my life in
fear sometimes but I've taught myself to
know that I'm worth it and to get
through it and try things that I never
thought I would do because what's the
worst that could happen what is the
worst that could happen that's what I've
been doing a lot more recently it's made
me a lot more confident and I think
you'll see that in my videos and my
content to come I've just grown so much
image heard so much as an individual I'm
20 now it sounds so weird cuz I love to
the age of 19 but then again at the age
of 19 I was still very worried very
confused on my life but I did it done
now I have a great apartment I have a
great group of friends I have a major
I'm like doing well in school and I'm
ready to get back on YouTube now because
I had to have everything sorted out in
my personal regular life to come back
down here successfully and happily and
that's where we are at today so my nose
is though I'm the same Madison I will
forever be because my past
have always and always will shape me
into the person that I am today and the
days to come
but I'm a much more happier medicine and
you can know it that the videos that I
will put out I am happy with I'm not
gonna do content anymore that I don't
like doing because I don't like it if I
wouldn't watch it I'm not gonna put it
up in my channel I'm gonna do videos
that make me happy and I hope you guys
can continue to subscribe and follow me
on this journey thank you guys so much
so much for watching new videos will be
coming and I apologize again for the
break from the bottom my heart I really
do I didn't just want to like answer one
person on Twitter Instagram where I've
been because I want to explain to you
what has happened my personal growth and
what I'm doing right now so I'm still in
college everything's good
I'm a communication and English major I
graduate in a year it's incredible and
I'm super super happy and thankful for
you guys for my life from my growth and
for my confidence and just know if I can
be confident and happy coz I've been
through a lot you no matter what you've
been through better worse than I have
been through can be happy to you can be
confident you can love yourself boy girl

happiness and you should love yourself

judge yourself so choose to be happy
