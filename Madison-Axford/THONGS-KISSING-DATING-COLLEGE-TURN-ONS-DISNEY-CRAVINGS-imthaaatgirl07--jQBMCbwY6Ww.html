and McKenzie Mel and we are doing
another like Girl Talk video ask you
questions on Instagram what you wanted
us to answer and you guys left us a
bunch we're gonna try to get through as
many as we can but without further ado
let's get started first question is how
were you when you first started wearing
a thong inside of TMI knowing I don't
really remember yeah um I think my first
song was like one of those little free
luxury night everyone
oh yeah you know when you get those in
my home oh yeah underwear I think it was
probably like I don't like eighth grade
or something like that and I was like oh
and it's like so scandalous and you're
like I know I bought a song I should I
bought three thumbs because they were
like 99 cents like what seal when I was
in seventh grade but I didn't wait homes
until junior year of high school you
might add them
yeah but EXO sehun scale isn't sexy but
I never wore them but the thing is like
I didn't wear tight things or leggings
so it's not like I was like yeah wearing
leggings with regular underwear like I
didn't do that but I didn't actually
wear a thong when I start wearing
leggings which in junior year thank you
sir
okay I want to say it was like software
yeah I want to say freshman year but I'd
be no siree yeah I want to say software
it's not like you should enjoy them I
think you should wear them whenever you
wear leggings yeah you know your parents
might be like new songs but I mean I
don't really get what's one appropriate
about defects it gets to be like
seamless yeah first kiss stories from
each of you okay I'll start because my I
got a good clean short I said this like
every video ever okay so it was with a
guy that I have been friends with for
like mmm two years I'd say no no at the
time it was like one nap and then it was
like we're at his house we're hanging
out the whole day and then I have a pan
cackling when I'm saying that we kiss
like it was it was like you've heard of
this story so many times I don't want to
elaborate on it cuz there's more
interesting I think um but yeah so it's
like it was like more than just first
kiss that was our first kiss
it wasn't like it wasn't just like mutt
and then done like tears it was like my
first boyfriend in high school um so I'm
in this house and he lived in my
neighborhood and he walked me home oh no
like 11 o'clock at night so scandalous
and like drop me off the front porch and
he knows happened you wanna go home it
was a good offering bad I mean it was
just like it was like see mine was and
so I was like overwhelmed I think for
the first time I would have like yeah it
wasn't just like a bold are you I was 17
16 I think you're okay so it was my
grand baby my stories um 21st and um it
was her friend kind of with used my age
and so we were kind of talking um at her
like party and um it was kind of awkward
cuz like I kind of knew was gonna happen
too
and he kind of knew I was under had my
first kiss yet
and so I told him you had had a first
kiss yeah they would he told him I'm
like but um yeah and then it's gonna
happen like you're on the dance all
right do you guys go to the same College
no none of us do you know ways to
overall things stable different we're
all in the same state though and we're
all like an hour and a half away it's
like a little triangle looks like st.
Louis phone be on at school
okay a guy asked this is when a girl
been maybe five who was going up if you
vote that way but a guy asks is it okay
to kiss a girl on the first date totally
depends it it's just offense I don't
think there's anything wrong with that
I like a peg there's no that come on
even like a little more than that I
really don't think but it depends how
the date goes so if it goes bad you kind
of got to feel it out and see if it's
going the same for both directions like
I've ever kind of feeling it then I
there's nothing wrong with that I don't
think you need to like wait six dates
free kids but if it's like really
awkward or it's like a tinder date I
think maybe not yeah I respect people
that don't but I mean I think it's cute
when he will wait out you know that's
true and it's like all avoid tension
yeah that's what my kiss was I think
it's also like how much you know the
person so if you white been friends or
been talking for a while I don't I've
been busy
if you have been texting for a long time
in like met up or decide to go out is
different but your tinder day like that
one here that's harder HIV well why
should you
I'm gonna run up like how tall are each
of you five nothing I'm fat for three
thank you what are turn-ons edge heart
offs and a guy turn-ons and a guy well
first of all just simple someone who
smells good like it's gonna catch my eye
I'm just gonna grab my attention you
walk by you if you smell good it's like
if you don't gonna be like okay no but
like that guy at first um if you take me
seriously that's a plus I've had people
like don't doing and not necessarily has
like a set future but once something
happened like they want to achieve
something I think about dwarfing for
something because we're not working
towards something like what you're just
like yeah like you need to be a little
determined to do something so now I need
to turn opsin sorry someone who's too
too serious like that gets annoying
sometimes like if you just never laugh
you're like yeah
yeah like what um in somebody like yells
at other people all the time
John's I'd say something that's loyal
that wants to Ike pursue you and like
doesn't have any like distractions like
oh isn't distracted by any other girls
oh good turn-offs I like how you said
not so what that's not too serious I
think like since here is Morton and I
don't need to be cracking a joke I would
you said yeah that no like that's kind
of yeah I'm not like blueberry you know
but junkie like yeah this turn-ons good
listener
like I got eye contact and is like
totally interesting I'm like hi like
good personal hygiene and like they
exercise what every now and again like I
think that's like attractive it shows
like commitment
turn-offs I don't know bad I can I like
really one or two dirty next question up
but it's really good right right now is
it open do we get some Chinese
nice which Disney princess is most like
