tag I did this in the summer but as a
new year and I have a lot of new
subscribers and people come to my
channel hello thank you so much for
visiting and subscribe and click the
button below thank you you know I
thought I would do this video again
because why not it's nice to update you
on things that have happened in my life
we'll have things have changed in this
tag and this video questions so I'm not
gonna ramble on and on but without
further ado let's get started with the
TMI tag okay so question one is what are
you wearing I'm wearing this a navy
sparkly romper that I got from Charlotte
Russe and I think it's really cute of
his black bottoms and I didn't even try
on haul about a year ago I think it was
last Christmas Brega that I hauled this
and I adore it it's beautiful this is
actually the back of it umm the front of
its like super super low cut and not
really that classy for a youtube video
so it's like no no no we're gonna wear
this and my friend Audrey actually
suggested writing this is the front and
it looks very very cute this way so um
yeah I just turned into like a little
high nekron offer instead of a v-neck
Robert questions you ever been in love
no never
uhm we'll see if that ever happens three
ever had a terrible breakup um nothing
has changed really from this standpoint
so if you have already seen this video
my last night in the summer in June I
think I did mom ever had a terrible
breakup but I didn't think I had when I
did this question in this video at the
last time because the way things ended
with my boyfriend look you know what I
hate calling him that is he wasn't a
boyfriend he was just like a person that
was more than a friend and so the way
things ended our relationship was we
just stopped talking I don't really know
what happened to this day but what
happened after is him and this girl
first of all they did some stuff that I
found out about later but they like not
harassed me but like we're like pranking
me and doing all this stuff afterwards
and I'm like are we literally sophomores
and high school no we're sophomores in
college
Rose cups they have nothing better to do
with their lives at this point I guess I
was how are you I am a thigh of four how
much you weigh
uh I think it was 105 last time I
weighed me I am gaining weight and I'm
super happy about that if you don't
no me are you new to my channel I would
Vic eighty something I don't even
remember my like genius senior years of
high school and so I was always under
weight you have too much a doctor I was
underweight and so now I'm finally at an
amazing place when I'm over hundred
pounds and I'm healthy for once come on
yes any tattoos
no I actually do not like to tease
anymore I went through this huge space
of what being obsessed with them and
loving them my junior year of college
no my job I'm not even there yet my
junior year of high school I was
obsessed with him I wanna get in 9,000
of them and I was like mom signed its
consent for him because I am getting
them I'm 16 but I am getting my arms all
tatted up and she was like you know I
don't know if that's like a good thing
so I'm not gonna sign this and thank God
she didn't because I would have all
these issues like I wanted a sailboat in
an anchor and an infinity sign and all
these common white girl ones and like an
Indian headdress and what else - no a
dreamcatcher and a skull like all these
random things that I was into majr and
I'm like don't like oh my god I couldn't
mess if I had my arms tested with those
certain things because those symbols
mean nothing to me at this point in my
life any piercings yes Oh two holes in
my ears and that's all
OTP I'm ganna say my OTP is Monica and
Chandler because they're both sizes and
like they didn't think they'd ever end
up together because they're kind of
similar um yeah they're different but
you know what I mean and like and they
do end up together and I just think it's
really cute though I love them fair show
RuPaul's Drag Race and friends are
probably my all-time favorite - the ones
that I watch over and over again
favorite bands uh I don't really listen
to bands I don't I don't think I really
I don't think I listen to like any bands
or if I do it's not more than like one
song that was like a pop hit I'm not a
bad person so then you miss Jeff I miss
being able to talk to him whenever I
wanted to and being able to like see him
and I think the scary part now it's like
I'm forgetting what he sounds like
like his laughing his voice started to
go back to like past videos to hear it
again
I'm like forgetting it's been almost
five months so it's like yeah it's
actually haha
Jarett song I'm so glad to see that was
to sissy that walk it's one that when it
comes on I'll listen to it no matter
what by RuPaul you know like it's my
favorite Paul song my favorite song all
the time because I love the message it's
my in song like my outro I just played
to that let's just do that one I don't I
love that song it has a like a deep
meaning it deep rooted meaning to me
how are you 19 years old and 5/12 zodiac
sign I'm a Leo and I think if it's a
perfectly because I don't think any wish
it and I'm loud and I'm confident and
I'm bossy and yeah I'm very controlling
let's just put it that way
what do you look for in a partner
someone who wants to do something with
their future oh my god if you are at a
dead end and you have no Drive to ever
do anything else I'm just like it's that
you just want to do something with your
life if you have nothing to look forward
to or strive for or to try to achieve
then it's like what are you doing you're
just like chillin like come on have some
driving up some motivation have some one
long and need to do something with your
life and make it worthwhile favorite
quote is RuPaul and it's we're all born
naked and the rest is drag minut my
favorite quote change it's like each
month or each time I do this but America
right now is well born a given are so
drag and I think you so true because
drag doesn't just mean boys dressing up
as women you know it means we're all
born the same and then we choose what we
want to do and what we want to create
with ourselves fair doctor I guess out
this are just come Argan because I love
sex and city that's another favor show
second city gets favorite colored um I'd
say gray loud music or soft loud all the
time where do you go under sad my room I
guess I'll shit on my computer I I'm not
like gonna go if I'm sad I'm not gonna
go sit in a room doing like no that's
not me so I will just go on a computer
to distract myself and like do something
else ha let's take you to shower 12
minutes
I'll take you to get ready in the
morning if I am not wearing makeup
it'll take me four minutes if I'm
wearing makeup it doesn't make my makeup
takes me a little time it's just that I
like to do it very slowly and listen to
music
like chillin Jam so I'd say a good out
half to get ready if I'm doing a full
face ever been a physical fight yes I
have it done video better watch it if
you don't know what I'm talking about
turn on is someone who doesn't do into
rugs I think it's disgusting this is the
biggest turnoff which is the next
question someone who does drugs you're
just wasting your life honestly like I
don't feel like we've been addicted we
can't kill you but we'll weave this
smells and it's gross you're like
altering your state of mind so it's not
really you and I don't like that so it's
my personal preference I think it's
disgusting I'm gonna get constantly beat
ain't it just guessing and I'm not
talking about weed for medical purposes
that's a totally different thing I'm
talking about for recreational fun
purposes that's not what I like okay oh
yeah her line is just someone bought
somebody saw it's good I've said that
before very true if you smell bad it's
like oh my god go away from me yeah
someone who is understanding I think if
you're gonna oh no another turnoff is
someone who has eyes for everyone
and I always say that guy contacted a
good thing to an extent but just know if
he's staring at you all the time
he's price Taryn and nine other girls as
well ah the reason I joined you too wise
because well one I was just I know some
main differences may different answers
and parts to this question but in short
I was bored I was a junior in high
school and I wasn't good at any other
hobby I wasn't good at yeah I'm okay
it's singing but I wasn't good at
dancing or acting or any sports or I was
in the artist like I know hot yeah I
joined it cuz I was bored and I wanted
more friends and I went to just make a
name for myself and kind of like a
little business little entrepreneurship
which is what I have done and started
and created through YouTube fears uh
like I'm scared okay I don't this is the
thing fears I don't fear a lot of things
but I get nervous about everything it's
different because I get nervous about
little things do I have great fears no
I'm not afraid of death I'm not afraid
of heights like I get nervous about
things but I'm not fear full of many
things I guess just becoming this meant
and this is what I was doing if yours is
like becoming unconscious and no one's
there to help me so I just die it's like
if I like would pass out and known as
there and like I just died like that I
guess I'm scared I have no one being
there like safe for me
last thing that made you cry don't
really cry often I get angry I'm often
my I'm watered and I like it cried when
my sister accidentally punched me in the
eye last week but other than that I'd
say probably when Jeff left it was a
mess I was really bad nose raining it
was just so dramatic but not really I
don't really cry that's how you said you
love someone I mean I say so my family
all the time but I'm guessing you know
someone else so I guess it would have to
be Jeff again when the last time today
that he left or the last day that I saw
him we said it by misses my fila all the
time
yeah other person not in my family Jeff
meaning behind your youtube name I you
really do James not messing back sir if
you're new here you probably think it is
I never lost seven it's been that way

channel obviously that was the name I
had to have for it and originally I was
I'm that girl because that was my you're
a TV show at the time that girls like a
show from the 60s my favorite number

unique you know I'm that girl oh seven
that was the name okay
that's what you read I had to read this
forensics book which was the real the
real life of a forensic scientist for my
friends this class in college it was
good if you like forensics I don't like
that stuff so with Corey the book you're
currently reading I don't read books
last show you watched RuPaul
last night that's person you talked to
was my mom a few seconds ago the
relationship between the last person you
texted jury which is one of my best
friends and I love her favorite food is
cheese or potatoes um it fluctuates
between the dukes I love them so much
republic cheese it just trumps
everything I mean the one if you'd only
chase what are you doing
he's mac and cheese grilled cheese chips
and cheese crackers and cheese so many
great things go with cheese place you
want to visit Cape Cod I went there when
I was little and it's like a fetus but I
don't remember it because I have no
recollection of memory from way back

shore and the sea you know yeah last
place you were target was last place I

you kissed someone guess I'd say about a
month ago
