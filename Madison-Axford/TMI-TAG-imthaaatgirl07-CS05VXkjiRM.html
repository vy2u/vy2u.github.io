video I haven't done in about almost two
years really it's been like a year and a
half since I've done the TMI too much
information tag and I'm excited to do
this you learn some more stuff about me
if you didn't know all of this already
don't be fun to do just a simple tag
with you again because I do have a lot
of new subscribers and a lot of new
viewers then maybe don't know these
silly little questions about me or it
just might want to get to know me and
since my channel is not a new one it's
more like establish like I didn't just
start out doing YouTube I've read each
other these types of tag videos with
when when you're first meeting me but
there are new people and I just kind of
realize that there are new people and so
I want everyone to be meeting me and get
a first impression of me and not just
you know watch the brownout or video and
then think that's all I am so without
further ado this piece of hair a little
bit so without further ado I'm gonna do
the TMI tag so that it would be the most
funny fun to do yeah let's get started I
am wearing this off the shoulder dress
from love culture I think it was it's
just like a floral design it's really
baggy and I don't know I really like it
it like has a little hole here and
between the sleeve and the main part of
the dress but I think it's very cute why
would I wear this for a video because
I'm fancy and I'm Madison
and why not no never I am like in that
stage in my form when I'm like does love
exist and I know that's stupid because
I'm literally 18 but I'm like oh my god
like nothing ever works out I'm still
waiting here and then I watch like
Colleen ballinger video of like her
wedding and I'm like okay there's
someone out there for me but no I've
never been in love
whereas you happy with love right now um
no it just kind of ended and like
there's no closure and we never talked
again so it could be terrible but I
wasn't like terrible like fight it just
kind of ended I'm five four and a half I
think I think it last video I might've
set by five because I was like really
loving that five four-and-a-half part
but um it's I'm not round enough it's
like four and a half
I have gained so much weight and I'm so
happy for it if you know me have
struggled with this for a long time not
in the eating disorder I've never had to
use order but moments have ilysm is so
fast that I've never actually been able
to gain a lot of weight like in my last
video almost two years ago I only
weighed like 81 82 pounds but now I
weigh 113 and I'm so happy about it so I
mean I'm not afraid to show like share
that like I'm so happy that I'm finally
at an established weight that's healthy
for my age
I think that's healthy it's better than
where I was okay yes
No I drop them on myself all the time
would you actually have any real ones no
I'm so indecisive I don't think I could
ever decide and want to keep it for my
whole life
yes I have um my first and second holes
in both my lobes Colleen and Joshua or
Jaclyn John RuPaul's Drag Race
I don't listen to bands whipped well in
advance I guess if you consider for
harmony man they're pretty jamming
they're pretty good um is that a band I
took a girl group I guess it's a band
and they'll play instruments I really
listen to bands now sorry
I miss my childhood I said this is my
last one I know it's so cheesy but
literally I just miss so much being able
to like come home from lick school and
just play dress-up or what's a Disney
movie and you know I not be like
criticized for just doing whatever I
wanted I didn't know any bad in the
world you know everything was just so
simple and great back then sissy that
walk
I'm 18 I'm turning 19 in about a month
August 17 you back I'm a Leo and I think
I'm exactly Leo like I was not given the
wrong sign I was born at the perfect
time because I am a Leo and every way
she performed my policy loud confident
obnoxious you know I'm kind of I'm I'm a
Leo hi this is the thing when someone's
not determined and when someone doesn't
care about their future it doesn't when
it make me think about a future for us
you know as a pair so if a guy is like
you know he hasn't to be the smartest
bulb in the box or the cutest crayon in
the box but he has to you know decent to
look at and you know has some brains and
he has to be funny because nobody wants
totally all the time serious guys
because I'm not a serious girl and
who just wants to have a future who
wants to have some goals that he wants
to achieve in his life America tis also
something from RuPaul and it's what
other people say of you it's none of
your business and I feel like that is so
true because what other people say about
you doesn't pertain to you they're
thinking about it they're singing it to
other people but it's not your business
just like what you think and say of them
or of anything or anyone is not their
business so just ignore what they say
that's just the base root of it is just
ignore the haters Jennifer Aniston or
Mila Kunis love wearing gray black and
whites especially black yeah black my
favorite color like color color is
probably pink loud oh my god loud put
like what's the point of soft music like
it's like it's not there like not what
has me blaring
either outside um or just in my room but
I don't really get that off it I'll get
mad but I don't really get sad like to
be honest I used to a lot but not
anymore
like I don't I'll get sad I'm not a
robot you know but I'm not like I just
always get pissed it's usually what
happens with me probably about 10 to 15
minutes ish
if I'm doing really light makeup it
could take me anywhere to a from a half
hour to like an hour and a half it
depends like what kind of a look I'm
doing yes with a guy at college it was
scary I'm not gonna get into like many
details but it was totally uncalled-for
it wasn't like my fault but I could say
that alcohol was involved on the other
person's side I don't drink so obviously
I was not under the influence but he was
so I think that's what might have
happened so yes I've actually been like
I've been shoved and pushed into things
a guy who smells good if you like you
don't need to drown yourself in Cologne
but just a little hint of something it's
like okay you care enough to put that on
so head drinking to the point where
you're puking like everywhere like that
I encountered that so much in college it
was just disgusting like that's just
like get away from me if you don't know
how to control yourself at this age then
you need to go back to kindergarten
that's disgusting like no one to stop
the reason I joined YouTube was because
I felt like I had a lot of creative
things I wanted to share and I wanted a
lot of friends and I didn't have my
friends going through middle school in
high school and so I thought this would
be like a way to not get subscribers but
get friends so when my numbers increase
I'm like oh my God look at all these new
people care about me and like I start to
care about you guys because I start to
know who you are and see your comments
again and again on my videos or maybe
it's different pictures or on Twitter
and yeah it's like the subscribers this
subscriber count' means so much to me
it's so great because I think this
people truly care about me and like me I
want to see more and I love you guys
just as much as you like watching my
videos or like me like I see you guys as
friends because my friends come back
watch my videos so I see like you guys
as friends who want to come watch my
videos so that means a lot to me so
that's why I started was to get more
people to know me and so I can know
where people and just some more friends
that's I'm kind of sad it's the truth
the troupe's is sad fears
my fear is probably just throwing up or
passing out in public and not even
Linksys the throwing up or passing out
there I'm not scared to pass out or not
square to throw up
it's like when people do afterwards this
when I'm scared I'm scared of how people
are gonna act and react to me either
throwing up or passing out especially
passing out it's like you're unconscious
so what are people gonna do there nml
scared and it's just gonna be like a
like I hate it that's what scares me is
like what people are gonna think of me
after something like that happens it's
actually yesterday and I like don't cry
ever and um a family member of mine um
oh my god I'm getting so sad again had
some scary news like they might be
diagnosed with cancer
and so they had to get like checkups
again to see if they were gonna be
diagnosed the cancer or if it was a plus
alarm and we found out yesterday that it
was a false alarm
and it was just the most amazing moment
like it was happy tears um of course and
it was just the most incredible thing I
don't know it's just like I cancer has
never crossed my mind until it was so
close to happening in my family and it
just makes me have so much like so much
sympathy for people who have to deal
with that I look at my life in a new way
now and so I don't know what's happening
yesterday so yeah I thought I would just
kind of share my mom
I've set still attending Miami you to
name is that girl was my favorite show
of the time it's an old old TV show with
Marlo Thomas as main character who moves
to New York to become an actress which I
love and 7 was my favorite number 17
which is my birthday day I feel like
that's everyone's favorite number
but 7 I don't know why I didn't um I got
also a teen but it I'm a girl of seven I
guess it kind of rolled off my talk
about her and I couldn't say that girl
because I'm that girl so I wasn't just
like that girl no I am that girl no
seven I had a number so yeah last book I
read Oh Chad oh dear look I read I'm
thinking
Catcher in the Rye my junior year of
high school big book I'm currently
reading it's like on and off its
RuPaul's working it um it's like a guide
to style but that's what I'm reading

a month ago but that's all I'm gonna say
every day on YouTube like I just don't
read them anymore I know I'm being
insulted somewhere somehow some way some
shape some form but I don't like keep
track that I want I don't care it
chocolate I sing and that's it
my tiffany earrings that I got from my
boy know that I bought for myself
because I'm an independent woman who can
buy my own expensive jewelry um I swam
does that count
was that a sport yes sport right yeah
it's a competitive sport but I just
pretended I was a mermaid in the pool
I've dreamed a dream from Leamas has
been in my head for the past 72 hours no
joking you asked my mom I just keep
living it I'll be sitting here and I'll
be like talking to someone and it'll be
like huh but the Tigers come at night
and they'll be like what no be like wait
their body stops his Thunder it just
keeps coming out like singing vomit as
they tear your hope apart as they turn
your dream to share it just keeps coming
out is your only silence but in my head
I constantly I'm kind of my Spotify
playlist on with those pops on and see
this you know greatly miss on but lamest
song out of my head it just won't go out
I just keep singing it I dreamed it it's
not a line it's more like a face to like
let the person know that like it's on
it's like this and then they're just
like let them know that you're
interested and ready for them
I've worked a lot and then I got sick
