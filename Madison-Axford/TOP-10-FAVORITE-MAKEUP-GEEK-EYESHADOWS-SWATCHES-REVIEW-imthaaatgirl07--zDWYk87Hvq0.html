about my favorite well top 10 but it's
actually top 11 but don't tell the
others that they've raised makeup geek
eyeshadows and I was a little late on
the makeup geek train I never liked
hopped on since I was to privacy but if
you actually think about it it's not
pursued all the same like flounce amount
of eyeshadow you get as mac one where
it's like a ten dollar difference so
this is my pink Z palette I have another
one but this is what i like to call my
favorites palette it's my top 10
actually 11 but I didn't sound good to
say top 11 so sat up 10 um make up each
shot is I use daily um these are like
the only eyeshadows already use in your
work so I love them over anything or
decay um stila mac even I love Matt but
I'm like price though literally these
are six individual except for the foil
one to 10 and then Mac is like 16 I
think so my mine it's the hot things
you've held if you're wondering it's the
medium no large I don't know it's one
that holds 20 damn I don't even know I
think 25 now I don't know ok so here you
can see they're all I kind of neutral
and browns and blacks and like nudes and
these are my top eleven favorite makeup
each shadow is going to swatch them and
tell you a little bit about them where I
love them and yes this is my go-to
palette that I created that I use every
day for my shadows I don't use anything
else the first shade we have right here
is called corrupt it's just a nice black
it is literally the darkest black and it
really sets my under eye but i want to
add black underneath my eyes that is
what i will use this helps like set all
of the eyeliner in everything that i put
under there and helps them not run and
if I that are still does run it's hidden
because of the shadows that I smudged
out underneath on my you know lower lash
line I love that color it is a just mat
beautiful black no glitter in it and I
just it's a good my go-to black I always
made a good black and so I finally got
that one next is this one right here
this is cocoa bear it's one of my
absolute absolute favorites of all time
I love this one is just a nice brown
it's not as dark as the shadow looks it
is a nice like transition or cut for
coming out your crease kind of color and
it's such a nice transition shade i love
it for that but um yeah
just beautiful it's easily easily easily
blendable and it's just one of my
absolute favorites then right here we
have cosmopolitan it's a nice salmon II
pink glittery color it's a nice overall
lid color I really like this one it's
just when I'm trying to appeal lid not a
very intense makeup look but just I want
to apply a little shimmer you can just
do this without any other question of
the close to like you just use
cosmopolitan and be good to go because
it is so sparkly and it has a lot of
dimension to it then down here in the
corner these are no specific order by
the way this is latte it's just a nice
brown color it's similar to creme brulee
except there's a little more ground
rather than yellow again it's just a
nice starter color before I apply any
other shadows I just like to blend this
out in my crease before I go in with a
lid or a definitive crease color and
that is just nice to kind of card out
the shape of my eyelid so I don't go
above or below it this one right here is
one of my absolute favorites it is
called bitten it's um it's really an
amazing color take a purplish red and it
doesn't appear as like dark is that it's
easily blendable just a cocoa bear and
it they don't they're very vibrant um
I'm not like diminishing any worth or
any pigment that they do have because it
all are very pigmented but they're
easily blendable so if you don't want it
to be that jar it's easy to not make it
that jar easy to blend it out I use that
for thanksgiving actually because i love
that and so much this one I hear is
everyone's favorite peach smoothie it's
just a nice yellow transition color nice
to carve out the lid I usually I usually
mix um peach smoothie creme brulee and
cocoa bear and sometimes bitten
sometimes latte all like for my crease
before I go on with my lid and like
other sparkly pink my soil glitter photo
glitter foil shadows um I ways peach
smoothie is just really yellow um and
which actually works well because i use
foundations with yellow undertones down
here is creme brulee another one that i
blend with peach smoothie cocoa bear
latte and bitten they're all just kind
of I needed shades that could work as
transition shades and easily blendable
shades and I researched every single one
of the colors before i bought it to make
sure that's what i wanted and and it's
another one that works amazingly on any
skin tone most of these do this one here
shimma shimma it's like a nice
white bright brightening yeah um shadow
and it's kind of like iced latte from
l'oreal infallible I shadows because it
just packs on all these do they pack on
so so nicely with just a nice flat brush
I apply a little fix+ to my brush and
then I'll go in with these all these
shadows and just pack them on that's a
nice lid color to go on top of my
transition crease colors and it is also
similar to steal a kitten and the white
one in the two faced natural eyes
palette that I forgot what it's called
this one I hear is envy it's a dream die
has so much blue undertone like in a
different light it looks like a dark
navy turquoise blue I really like this
to pack on my lid entirely before I put
on this other one that i'm going to show
you called Houdini which is a foil but I
like to just put this on before I put
the foil on top just as a nice base you
can wear it alone you can also were
bitten alone but just be careful when
you wear these two dark shades alone
make sure you have a very nice brush
they putting on with so you know I'm
jagged uneven lines if you're doing your
entire lid with just one shade I've done
that before with like I didn't eat
Oriole on it but yet so when you're
using these two especially because
they're so dark make sure that you have
a nice thin little brush to like carve
out your lid and then fill it in um
after you do that next we have
grandstand it's my all time favorite is
just just like amber rush by L'Oreal
infallible I love l'oreal infallible our
shadows are amazing there are eight or
nine dollars while these two these two
oils are ten rather than the rest or six
um but I absolutely love grandstand it's
just most beautiful beautiful amber
color it is exactly like it except a
little more easy to put on and it sticks
a little better than l'oreal infallible
because i don't know maybe make a few
kissin formula like I don't have the
form of this is just incredible I can
explain a little fix plus from Mac on my
brush and then go and pack this as an
entire lid color over my transition
shades I'm in love with my favorite
anime Houdini Houdini Houdini is a
little hard to work with because it's so
so dark um whereas the grandstand is a
little easier to blend if you put too
much on or to bless like you
put too much or too little on it's easy
to blend well Houdini is beautiful oh my
god it looks like a friggin ocean but
it's a little hard again to shade if
you're gonna go in at this color you
better go in and do the damn thing
because if you go if you try to go
halfway it's not gonna look right so you
got to pack this on but again maybe go
in with a tinier brush and card out of
your lid shape first with a little
houdini and then go ahead and pack it on
just so you don't get any uneven jagged
lines so again these are my top 10 11
favorite makeup geek shadows I hope you
