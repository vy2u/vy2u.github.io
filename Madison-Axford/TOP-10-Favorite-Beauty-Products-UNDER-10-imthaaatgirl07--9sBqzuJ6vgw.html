hair okay we're not gonna say that it
looks like a pastry on top my head got
it cool beans
what you can
hey house today I'm doing my top 10
favorite products of all time that are
under ten dollars so i may have a
different products that's my favorite of
all time but it wasn't under ten dollars
so what could it be in this video so
that further ado let's get into my
favorite photos full-time that are cheap
AF so these are all products are like
high high quality it seems like saying
something that you would get you know at
a high-end store or a support rather
than a drugstore but they're all from a
drugstore so it's like what mine below
the first product and basically all
these dope products you've heard me rave
about 100 billion times but if you
didn't get the memo I'm doing a whole
entire video dedicated to it so you know
to buy these so you know that these are
great products you know you're going to
get your money's worth even though it's
not much money to spend at 0 the first
part is the covergirl outlast stay
fabulous three-in-one foundation um it
has SPF 20 NM which is great grand
traffic amazing but if I had a chance to
get a high-end foundation for free or
paying for this one I would pay for this
one this rendition is the grazing whole
time I used it once hated it like three
years ago but I tried it again this my
like my none bottle recently okay I keep
going through this so quickly because I
used so much of it and i love it too dad
i just bought this one today I keep
eyeing it I love it oh I just love it so
much it's the most amazing coverage most
amazing feeling it's so light if it
gives a heavy great coverage I love it I
love this foundation cover girl wow wow
the second product is another cover girl
product and it's my professional loose
powder I love this stuff it's a little
messy but time if you're careful not to
make a mess you'll be fine you won't get
it everywhere like I do I've had it
forever and it's like not even not even
a sixteenth of the way gone so well the
third favorite make a product under ten
bucks that I have is my L'Oreal
infallible eyeshadow 24 hour in 892
amber rush I love this stuff it provides
the highest quality and eyeshadow head
it you don't need primer it's just like
I'm really really high
and I shat up this eyeshadow is just the
greatest color ever it's such a shiny
vibrant um rose gold color and it lasts
forever in the day so I love this stuff
so much i can't believe it's under 10
bucks can believe any of these are but
they are the next product is by remote
and it's my natural bronzer by them I
love Rimmel face powders if you haven't
heard me say that one hundred ten times
already and it provides amazing amazing
color it does not look orange at all I
haven't cooled a bronzer that i'm using
which I love but i think i love this one
more like I think this one feated and I
I loved it it was in my July favorites I
love it my fist favorite product under
ten dollars from the drugstore it's my
duo eyelash glue I wear eyelashes a lot
I don't wear them because I don't have
like decent lashes I wear them because I
love wearing thick eyelashes I think
they're so fun shut up this stuff is
amazing it's so high quality it blows my
mind how well it stays on if you get an
eyelash pack or you get eyelashes they
would have put on do not use the glue
that comes in at the packs it does not
work in the slightest this though do it
make sure I let's just an forever you
don't worry about them coming up it's
like a special event a wedding of prom
homecoming a graduation you know
whatever is good to go my sixth Farah
product is what I've talked about in
every video I've ever done since that
was born these van is your wine dark
circle eraser concealer by Maybelline is
my second two of it I go through it so
fast it's just like a roll of little
sponge and it covers everything your
dark spots your your blackheads your
whiteheads your redheads your redhead
your your pimple is that our red pink
whatever color they are everything
everything is discovered i put it on my
nose and under my eyes because those are
my dark bed problem areas and wow I'm
I'm exact can't talk about this I talked
about so much i'm just wearing it out
it's so great my step and favorite
product is an oldie but a goodie it's my
great lash lots of lashes if i had to
pick one mascara from a drugstore it was
under 10 bucks it wouldn't have to be
this one this one is such a lifesaver i
always go to this one when I need one
and I don't know which one to get I
don't really want to try a new one and
go back to my great lash lots of lashes
um yeah it's just I mean the way the
brushes shade to go with the formula of
it it just it's like four dollar and it
works so much holy it just makes my eyes
just pop my eighth favorite product
under ten dollars is my sonia kashuk
eyebrow pencil it's so easy to fill in
your brows and not make it look like you
actually drew them on um and I don't
draw my eyebrows I just fill them in a
little bit that I give you that
disclaimer um but yes I love this I have
never really used any Kashuk products
but the ones that i do have i love so i
picked this up on win and i have been
loving this so much it makes your
browser so natural and so vibrant in
like BAM look my brows and I love this
Mike nice favorite product is my grits
for tiny it's my Rimmel scandaleyes
black eyeliner and if you need a
drugstore eyeliner i recommend this to
everyone i know a lot of eyeliners
aren't waxing up they don't come on
fiber in enough they don't come up on
the waterline as a tight line on the
eyelid on the whatever and this one it
definitely does it's so vibrant and it's
amazing amazing color it's just black
it's just black 001 black but i love it
so much I can't even tell you I loved so
much I can't even tell you it's great i
need again you want to be soon it's so
cheap and i will never go back to a
different eyeliner ever again because
this one is a keeper same with my liquid
liner which is my 10th and most favorite
product ever my maybelline lines
stiletto liquid liner in blackest black
wow I was having trouble finding your
liquid liners I would stay on that was
easy to apply it was this that whatever
because I know liquid liner is a really
handsome big problem for a lot of people
because they can't apply it easily and
it doesn't stay on it looks crappy it
looks like you were shaky it's not the
vibrant comes up like a gray color not a
plaque Wow Maybelline you about done
yourself with us when I love my
Maybelline like stiletto you just shake
it
before you apply and then you apply it
and it's great it's so easy to apply it
you can get it easy cat eye eyeliner
that you know winged liner whatever or
just a line that I just do line I don't
really do winged eyeliner it's not
really my thing right now in this point
in my life but oh my god i love
maybelline line stiletto it took me a
while i buy this because i was like it's
kind of expose up no get it you go get
