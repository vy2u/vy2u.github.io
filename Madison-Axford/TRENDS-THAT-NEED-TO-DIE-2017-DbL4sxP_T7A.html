very very excited to do but also a real
hesitant I know that this video may piss
a few people off and that's definitely
not my intention at all it is supposed
to be taking very light and almost
comedic in a sense because the topics
I'm talking about are funny and so don't
I want to get butthurt offended rude or
attack like towards me this is the fun
video of trends that I have seen and
even probably have done so myself but
think that need to slowly die or end for
the new year at 2017 so not just saying
these are from 2016 but anything I've
seen really in the past years in in the
world of fashion and beauty mainly that
are designed know knows that I think
should should go away because they're
not good these videos are strictly my
own I'm not telling you to subdue them
if you do it ourself wearing this if you
wear it it's just things that I don't
like but I don't partake in or do we're
we're and that I wanted to share and
this is my channel I can share whatever
kind of content I want and so if you
don't like it you know don't watch and
don't go on my channel but it is
supposed to be taken very light
heartedly but also I teach fashion as
funny as it may sound very seriously
like very serious discussion is very
important to me and it kind of like
saved my life in a way because it gave
me creative outlet when I couldn't find
it anywhere else so I love fashion I
love makeup and stuff like that and I
take it very seriously and so these are
trends and I'm just like when I see
people wearing them and I thought I
would share because I do study fashion
on that in school but just like
religiously at home I love it every
fashion magazine that so it's thought I
would share my passion with you because
I usually do some my funny kind of
videos recently like roasting and
reactants that might ice trend
I was trending away from when I started
the channel for which was fashion beauty
not so you can do other things
but I also like do these videos every
once in a while except is where I
started my channel Mohan's intro like I
said you're easily offended or hurt by
something that someone says but isn't a
personal attack on you I respect you and
love you completely but just click off
or just like the video and go away if
this isn't your cup of tea or fashion
trends that I think need to die in the
year 2017 so let's get started okay the
first thing that I think need to do that
needs to dye our septum piercings if you
have it great is it tour review with
toward the
saying I don't understand like if you
wanna okay I'm not a piercing person I
you're you know you're freezing that's
great but I don't like nose piercings
tongue piercing value button piercings
cartilage piercings or septum piercings
or eyebrow I think they're all a little
bit tacky in my opinion because I am
very like professional um I believe like
I do wear some some showy things but I
do think overall my personality is
conservative and professional and so
when I see someone pull like a septum
piercing out I'm like orbit hanging
there like it does look like a booger I
think we can all agree on that until you
get up close and see it's a little
glimmering shine of silver or gold but I
just really don't like them I think
they're very happy and look like a
booger a little spider spilling on your
nose I may can have it either like the
one that's like the servos left here and
it comes down it looks like a cowbell
and the other one that comes down in two
points out of both not both nostrils
that looks like a booger so sorry I
think that needs to go I just don't
think people I mean I see people in high
school have them you know age is like 15
to like maybe 21 or so through you know
high school to college but I'm like okay
think about this would you really want
that when you're like in a professional
job setting at like age 30
no okay exactly moving on this is the
makeup one Instagram eyebrows now I know
you're going to try to clock me and come
from eating like a beef stick to your
address in my head up are natural so I'm
going for people who freaking draw their
eyebrows on like a square root sign like
a check mark like three inches wider
than their natural brow if you want
tensley eyebrows in Clemens Dillon and
great that's awesome do it but at least
attempt to make it look like hair
because if I see tiny it's just like
like you know I'm talking about and it
was like oh my god I don't know what
that I wrote knows okay know and people
are gonna try to come over because
they're sick they're uneven they're
little ratchet but I don't touch them I
don't fill them in I don't coin them in
this is what I was born with in what I
live with day to day and I'm not going
to change that just like you can't
change you're probably ratchet browse
all of our browser ranches but you draw
an art I think you're all a queen fierce
with that I rub your wrong I get really
passionate and really in what if
Instagram eyebrows moving back onto the
fashion world phone cases that have like
a cover on the front you know what I'm
talking about okay
oh I don't know who you think you are
that you need a frickin phone cover case
like you're that important I know you
can see your shade getting it so it's
like a little book no that looks stupid
and tacking we know you guy from five
below you can have a phone case you need
to protect your phone that's great I'm
not a rock for you but one that like
flips open terrific when the guy my
phone oh let me flip open my freaking
book of a phone case no so tacky those
need to go a hazing you carry them
around like it's a frickin portfolio I
attend I'm like it's a phone why
you have a freaking computer case on it
no one okay if you know me my biggest
pet peeve is cardigans like oh they're
so ugly like my grandma more cardigan I
hate cardigans so much I just think
they're atrocious they don't provide
warmth they provide ugliness but touch
me personally you may hate this and
that's fine tell me that you ate my
outfit but it doesn't affect me so don't
let it affect you if I face is a
material outfit anyway but what's even
more annoying and that needs to end or
short sleeve cardigan okay and removal
button cardigan okay but literally a
short sleeve Guardians what are you
doing what just wear a t-shirt like it's
the same length as a t-shirt you did
bring a sweater a material oh I hate it
so much i shaped short sleeve cardigan
this is so ugly
I love heels I wear heels every single
day for the whole day I may feel Queen I
have like a million of them every one
color but what I don't like and I don't
think I like one pair of them because in
my room pollen so I love construe pole
but what I don't like is peep-toe heels
okay so you have like a heel and it's
not a point to cut around it it's not an
open toe it's like that little peep toe
so you just see enough of your unpainted
or chipped nail polish on pedicured
unclipped nail Otoniel ratchet-ass feet
with the freaking cracked heels and all
the on your big toe and as long as
I want to see that I hate toes I hate
feet I don't want you know a little
awkward to crack coming out just enough
stating to MSO to thrash it because like
open toed shoes are fine as you can see
all the toes okay you see all the toes
is great which is like this awkward long
second and third toe a guy that I hate
shoes are so and classy and they look
really trashy Tom I'm sorry I just I
really don't like toms I never had to
wear those mom jeans and tie-dye shirts
in middle school and I love and respect
completely what they do as a company and
give shoes or whatever whoever my mom
loves them and I know a lot of my
friends that wear them but I cannot
stand comms I'd rather wear like the
little flimsy flip-flops you get from a
period a pedicure and a nail salon
because Tom's to me just don't do
anything for an outfit except make it
look kind of bad so if you know where
jeans are cuffed jeans or shorts or a
dress and you pair with Tom's it's like
your Roman had a potential that outfit
had because they're just so they're like
pieces of cardboard I just like I really
a job respect the company in the CEO
completely but don't like the shoe mom
jeans okay
this trend needs to mister needed to end
before became a trend because I think I
get what you are trying to go with it so
I see mom jeans I respect when people
are trying to do but I just can't assume
a too big when they're too big that
they're like here's your like 10 yes
your calf and your thigh and the
halogens like this and we know you have
to prune Goodwill and they're kind of
stained and kind of like way to
whitewash denim but they just look
heinous and I'm just loose like my see
that I just I'm just wide why who does
it was a cool stuff I was a good idea
I'm sorry I really cannot stand mom
jeans and I know some of you were
wearing them like that aren't mom she's
like teens bringing it back in but it's
like to me they're so ugly and urban
that was selling that was like way
overpriced I'm like they're oversized
jeans that don't fit you and look like
you didn't know what size jeans you wore
so you borrowed your mom students from
1984 and now you're trying to pair it
with like a sweater and it's just not
working for me I don't I don't like that
aesthetic infinity
personally when people wear flare jeans
or flare yoga pants or leggings
isolating France where so where your
fancy flared jeans with ugh
first of all hell to the no that is not
look cute but Wendy oh okay there's two
things are going wrong with this with
swear and hugs when people try to tuck
them in which I in a cobra way to do
that in middle school because I didn't
want them to be pulled over that's the
other thing but um when you have an UGG
okay and you still come oh sure that US
brands
so you literally talk to flair yoga
pants or jeans and in the body ugh so
they kind of flare and poof out in the
bottom where the top of ugh starts and
oh my god no no no please don't do that
please
and what's even worse what I do the
worst is when you take the flare and you
pull it down over complete up which
makes it really tight because it's so
like spread out with you the others very
wide the air is pulling it over the top
of the egg and it has brain behind the
top and the front actually worn with
like leggings and that's about it but
another thing to not wear Uggs with with
shorts please I I did this once oh my
god no I know this is going to be
controversial but fake really take
anything brand wise but fake burberry
scarf because I've seen that more and
more especially was going to Chicago in
New York everyone in their grandma's
mother's aunt Kat and II think burberry
scarf we can tell that it's fake we can
tell it's not real because you know
there's no label okay we can see that is
a darker brown color we know you got
that off the street lender in New York
so like why you are you trying to play
back oh why you trying to clear the car
it doesn't look real and I know you're
an accessory you're a bitch because you
can afford it okay I I'm not saying that
they can or cannot afford it but what I
think is ridiculous is people who are
trying to pull off with this Burberry
because what am i oh that's a nice
tractor like thanks it's Burberry I mean
digital it's not that Brown is a lot 10
in the Burberry original target don't
even try me
combat suits I mean rip like these were
huge my senior high school 2013 why are
people still wearing combat boots you
have so many more choices even riding
boots are okay okay but glam it up a
little bit combat boots are so 2000 and
late and they really need to stop being
worn because they just they're not like
short has to be booties and then Tommy
writing but serious like awkward in
between half of the calf looking a mess
okay what am i biggest fashion no knows
it's like when people try to wear like a
banjo with multiple strappy straps
crisscross E crap and then like a tank
top over top it does it go lowest income
and like slowly so I can see all of your
band opens and all of your tank up and
their stress everywhere the end does
lace and then you have this tank top for
weenus with the armpit holes like all
the other stress along face you know it
is too much going on and it does
look at I see tommy doing this
especially people like in college bando
seeing the aterna callosity job but it's
not and you're also using that as your
bro on us just like that as to what's
going on white heels whiteout yields are
so trashy to mean so trashy been the
epitome of cheap ass like I see why it
is like that fake leather and it's just
like so cheap looking like I really
can't stand my shoes I don't have one
pair of like white pumps I haven't go
white booty but like white pumps is just
so heinous looking the opaque hose oh I
know solid I hate pantyhose they're
disgusting to me they always like aren't
hanging down by the cross we've got to
pull it up and then you freakin nailed
with a hole in it and they get
transparent hair say but it's runs
anyway it'd be like 10 dollars an Atari
it's waste of money a waste of time and
they look horrendous because if you
special you wear open-toed shoes I guess
you think your feet look like was toe
it's because of your hose and then
people were Oh peg owes its black more
room Brown whatever ten okay close all
right one eye biggest entities as well
because they're just disgusting to me
they just look so bad I know it might be
cold but then if you're cold don't wear
the freaking directors core wear pants
do not wear holes they need to go this
isn't 1790 this is this is just no ugly
I hate hope they were prints anything I
can get down with a good cheetah with a
good leopard because those colors coming
that it's like you know the brownish
blackish kind of like a creamy brown
orange like is this is it leather fur I
love it love it
zebra print versus stark black-and-white
is horrendous it's so 2005 and anyone
who is soaring zebra and really
questioning your fashion taste because
you drafted in at least ten years in any
fashion magazine really it's just I
think it's a horrible print is a horrid
looking I hate I love like my I hate
them paired together in a zebra
formation this is been a more recently
seen trance Watchers that are bought
with a rate like holes in them
and I tried to jam with this I tried to
get with this but I'm right
so you're maybe shirt that has holes in
it that's what shirt with millions of
hold on the shoulder and all around and
six read it I get distressed I live love
love it you know James of holes its
minute trends in 1901 but like
sweatshirts would like hold that don't
really
look like they were meant to be there
they look like Oh like to get caught or
did it get like wash three times with a
good zipper I don't understand it's like
old wedge flip-flops and that's all I
may say about that one okay when people
are wearing like fanciest outfits like
um nothing like professional business
professional but just like a dress or a
sundress or like a nice top from like
j.crew or something um and then they
pair it with rubber Old Navy flip-flops
up mmm
we bought enough fan of Old Navy replica
props you'll rarely see me in them
unless it's been a rough day um I
usually wear like the nicer foot box
isn't going to wear flip-flops at all
why are you running this dress I'm not
telling you to wear heels but like at
least get some light nice or flip-flop
they're rubber rubber you just took that
outfit that could have been like eight
point five two is zero point two
interesting I have for my trans news
diet so far three or if 2017 is oh I've
seen all the times I was only one Asian
amber 21 stuff like that Charlotte Russe
bourbon out there so like that
I go in I feel like a cute shirt and
it's even like kind of cheap it's not
cotton it's nice fit it's soft the
perfect t-shirt I turn around some
stupid a shitty saying on the front life
I am a taco I love Donuts I don't care
like Netflix and chill party and chill
pizza and chill shut the up and
chill no those are awful and the stores
are ruining them and don't one's going
to buy that or no one should buy that
and where that leaves us I'm so cheesy
and childish and naive on the front like
a nice shirt from a store that I I do
respect but then it says only wretch and
 on her from like whiter roomis
who's gonna buy I am a taco
I know anyway help you hit videos are
not too offended they are my personal
beliefs of you where they I do not judge
I do not judge someone for what they
wear I respect everyone until you give
me a reason to not respect you but these
are things that I've never wear and I
just wanted to pass them on to you if
you care enough factorizing through all
the time so why can't I anyway smell
