so literally I feel like I'm broken my
neck I think I just slept on her own but
oh my god I have chronic and neck pains
I don't know what to turn editing I'm
always been looking down like this you
know a computer at a couch or at a desk
read it better when everyone I'm always
looking down or at a phone and just like
from the back of my head I mean next
like the top of my show I buy some flour
it's ever so bad and I have this problem
since like my Mizzou days I guess I've
been doing YouTube for about two years
son and it just mmm
hurts so bad and they're like seating
pack on it I always I was on at least
like chronic headache and tension
headaches and I feel like just talking
serious is literally just me complaining
tell you about like oh my ailments like
that anyway so that's what I'm dealing
with today sorry for the ratchet hair
and this bow I look like communica male
7 2012 speaking of her though my guitar
me video what up yesterday I was in
shower a student in I had the idea of
doing a kind of funny sketch like almost
video of where I pretended to audition
for fit Harvey you're like the x-factor
or whatever okay so first of all I want
you thinking that video serious using
Chrome they're pissed because I mean
there's no way in hell that I would ever
be in farming like there's no way that
they would find me don't avoid obviously
we know that that's how many people were
still do so but hurt and offended and
like whistling what are you doing this
you'll never replace them you look like
a thing did you watch the end because
it's literally like a parody satire
escaped 20 video thing or it was
supposed to be on my bad is common to
use it but not transfer I don't know so
that was what that to do what that like
I said I have the ID of the shower the
complaint do something funny because I
love you talking to us but I want to put
a lot more effort in that's in two
different efforts but you know it's easy
it's not much editing you just talk it's
normal for me and so I was like we
always find a little I mean more
difficult I love say
last thing I was listening up but I love
this thing I like dancing I'm a Cora
dancer but you know why not and I love
in harmony and I always have always have
loved their music so much so I thought
hey why don't I just try to create I
don't know how I felt cast off but I'm I
trying to do a thing audition thing and
I mean I think are pretty good Matt is
excited put it up and I think some
people need to be hitting it but a lot
of seem to be enjoying it so thank you
so much if you have a long video already
definitely check it out it's a lot I
mean I see like eight hours on yesterday
but it was fun and I like learned all
the dances I knew a lot of them already
but I relearned like Miss moving on and
stuff I forgot me guess so
I love that video so my favorite is I've
ever done even if you hate it it is
probably the craziest thing you've ever
watched at the same time it's kind of I
like laughed out loud when I was
watching it because of how I appeared to
extract clips with it so it was really
fun to me so yeah but anyway I go back
to school tomorrow so if there's a
little bit of lack of videos coming up
in the future you know what's happening
I didn't die I'm not going to youtube
not quitting I don't know how long
they'll be just have videos I'm going to
try my best to do videos nice we're for
sure but I would also eat so frequently
as it is now and I love it so I really
want to try to keep up its queries I am
taking maximum amount of credits you
could take but well so go back to school
tomorrow I like a teabags I'm taking
back like literally is three bags to
give all my speed of my bed um and yeah
but I'm excited I am excited like I said
I love my I love school I love being
with me I left homework I photos my
height so it's not like oh like I just
literally miles much sex but it's I mean
whatever I'm excited to see my new
teachers when you classmates many
classes my new Chris really material and
so yeah anyway the main hoodie video is
a trifle everybody knows I've seen a
million one of these videos before but i
okay this is getting friggin annoying
okay
it weighs like a hundred pounds anyway
so I've seen a million in one of these
videos before I never really watch all
the way through but this isn't really
for me to be like it don't matter so I'm
good it's just like I'm like oh you wait
enough like and other not I like it and
so they
we're thinking about buying these or
whatever because these are pretty cheap
I found it Marshall TMX rock homes it
stuff like that target so they they are
very readily available so if you thought
that maybe you were like once you or you
want to know if one is good and I tried
it and then you want to get it now you
know so let's just get right into trying
them so I didn't instantly I got this
one before Christmas but it's the re
perfume re perfume ariana grande perfume
called re and it's all so good like I
love it it feels very like almost like
very very sultry it doesn't seem like a
normal kind of fruity for loops for the
loom celebrity perfume it does smell
very like more adult like and it kind of
smells like black opium without a really
pungent Musk smell it smells a little
more like wearable for young teen but at
the same time very mature and so I
thought I would give this one dimension
if you were wondering I really like it
as great reviews I think it's her first
one honesty global I got this one at
Target like thirty dollars a claim I
just think it helps to amazing and this
is the 1.7 flow out I don't know I
really really like this perfume it just
so mature and I just like love having it
on because it's very like that's floral
not sweet but kind of like chocolatey
but doesn't smell like chocolate I did
want to fit it because we do throw in a
person but it smells like a like a dark
kind of sweet it's not like fruity but
yeah love that one
okay so I very small that one but these
five
what was that same style I have not
tried so I'm very I have to sell them
I'm nervous on some really fitted it's
trying to do okay
so I took the wrappers off so that I
didn't have to like do that for an hour
and a half on this video but I swear to
God I haven't smoked them yet so let's
see right start is it perfect first so
my god I'm so excited about when I saw
this I was like oh my god this is what
inspired me to do the video because I
would leave my queen vic minaj love
Nicki Minaj oh my god look beautiful she
looks okay so this is her original Pink
Friday it's the 1.7 ounces and I think
it was $15 is
oh my god it's about oh sorry my nose
itches like I see by coming it it's a
bottle with him okay okay mmm you for
smoke packaging yes oh I'm obsessed with
it her freaking a big-ass head comes off
its the cab and then her little chest is
the bottle okay packaging though with a
cloth cutter set but like that just this
is your perfume when it was in our body
and make your head amazed with anyone
else and I love this bottle and to see
look so cute on my procedure I like oh
I'm loving that I can't live in house
before they go through I are gonna grab
a clean image so I decide what okay so I
mean I just spray this in like the box
cuz I don't want it on me like a million
creams on me and I also don't think I
get smudged in there so okay I'm just
gonna do a squirt of this let it oxidize
mmm oh oh my god we kind of seen doing
up no no man come on I love that I
really like this okay it's very sweet
but not nominating me sweet like pink
sugar it smells like one of the subdued
creams like this one in Justin Bieber's
and Ariana got oil like what I the thing
I really like this though I can't
explain it kind of like okay I don't
know that smell is it just like smells
so good
it is sweet like I said but not like
distractingly
sweet I'm so okay so from this video we
went on the worst for team to describer
ever i really really like this perfume
it smells really sweet
so it still but it's melody center like
it doesn't smell good she bats like
Charlotte Russe perfume like sorry
Charlotte Russe Billings
okay then we got Justin Bieber some day
special edition hell is this special
edition and it's the once well okay
anyway I don't know how to position it
oh yeah I love it
I am are seeing the sigmay seems like
it's like a weight do it with a bullet
was it not purple or pink or something
in Macy's or wherever is this is so
little like crap on the time um is that
the special edition is blue okay I love
that needs like please take a moment for
these bottles bottles are so important
to me because like you can be familiar
like dresser or on a perfume tray like I
have so like I realize like well how
they look like completely doesn't matter
how they smell just like if they look
good okay so let's smell this I'll know
if it smells different I wonder smell
pending on the original some day exist
like a special edition okay just going
to see how it is
okay you know what it smells like I
smelled a times
it smells like throwback I'll into a
picture to win we were in like
elementary school of your life born in
the 90s we had those like met mark not
much murders but like marker that like
smelt it was what mr. smell or whatever
and this smells like that but like the
grape one you know I don't really like
about that I don't think this'll be
original I think this is like a ratchet
magic marker one I don't like this at
all okay you hungry me someday I feel
like there's a lot of like talk about
this it was like so good so maybe did
the original with this special Sean I
can see why I was $10 like there's like
nothing in it first I got small size my
goodness is I can now see myself wearing
us like unless I was like smelly Bo and
had no other with you not at you can mmm
not a huge fan no sorry just love it I
don't know it it smells like a great
magic marker so it's not like super
sweet it's like sweet but it also kind
of has this change of like a crappy
under when I like it
okay next I got Paris Hilton I always
wanted Paris little perfume the only
happens like cognac one though
but I always one over there after she
start with 1,800 and a half like why not
and it was her can pan one um I feel
like this premieres literally like 2005
wave is like an old one but oh well it's
a 1/4 ounce so let's see it Pato what
what why is it bottling baby like this
is the same thing this only wasn't
exposed to like beautifulness and though
this is it like I like a little potion
but like yo Paris work on your like
presentation though alright ouch I need
the box okay you know what booth okay we
have a pink cap so I guess if dance or
something but like this just go click
like I would literally get at Claire's
for my dollars it's like at 12 dollars a
night okay
wait ha ha ha ha oh my pit okay
I likes it I do it's very sweet it does
smell very like 1999 stinger scripts at
Claire's someone's testing the perfumes
do-over smell it that's what it smells
like so you know this isn't running up a
perfume in the late 90s I'll put it
right here picture of it it's like when
Walmart song it's like a cotton candy
smell it smells exactly like that in
something exact like cotton candy and
kind of like bubblicious boyoung bubble
those it smells good I feel like like
this one I was literally put it up there
was like a Chanel it smell so good like
so well created and crafted like a lot
of times oh no this is good
not all here is good but it kind of
sounds like someone be like do you eat
here for two number 21
or was it about that and it's like nuts
there's something um it's not bad I like
it I like it a lot more than this
there's no bleep ask me so you like it
it's kind of like $10 this is like fun
you don't know - yeah it's crazy
next we have Katy Perry tiller queen
I knew Katy picked out a lot like her in
the hour whatever the hell they are fall
but I didn't know about this one even
existed um so yeah I mean it's like it's
looking okay Katy Perry thing like it
looks like frickin Elizabeth Arden or
silac was very old but um yeah I think
some Ellington's Catina thing which
released her last album prism
okay yes and honey how this public so
put this on my little tray it's a point
this order is get stand on his own I was
I really wanna buy it like from Macy's
early ultra like a high-end department
store this protein called angel muse
I love it I go in there and smell it
every friggin home in there but it's
like a on circular kind of container so
you lay down your trials like that's
like a real turnoff because I don't have
a perfume folder and so because I don't
have a holder I was late on inside so
sharra first by an $8 perfume is because
like you'd have to lay it on the table
it takes a blow to room on your tray or
nightstand or whatever it just kinda
looks bad but I'm I can't just can't
stand up like that's really annoying why
don't you make the person that can't
stand like why we can isolate with base
so I guess beautiful looks like a
freaking like I don't know
pendant Jim maybe one and I have to lay
it down okay this is 3.4 fluid ounces so
oh yeah this one was month one so exhale
but like vintage huge you have a tag
dollar like that's it
at Marshall so yeah three wipe off boxes
school big okay so looks pretty lonesome
is beautifully engraved Katy Katy Perry
Lake oh oh I was having a bougie and
taking it off alwah usually cut my thumb
open can't smell anything
okay so it's like a beautifully Ruby
looking color and it's like ombre look
great I always wait a second so I don't
breathe a like always like alcohol
smelling and chemicals okay come on Katy
Perry don't move down okay so that's not
that why do I like laughs um okay I like
this I and I appreciate it because it
smells very mature it doesn't smell
again teeny bopper kind of like this
crap I'm sorry to sound like I'm sure
how things are going but like balance is
what let me gosh I like this a light
smells like this old woman I used to
work at my school store in high school
which I appreciate ship knife she let me
like get him attitude 25 cents cheaper
when you have it a quarter but living
okay so alright peeps on the throne no
but there's a penny all kinds of
freaking and do this like okay first for
raping world problems but like like
and okay I do like this how would
explain it is like it starts awfully to
kind of really once learn undertone
thinking smell way down deep at its
sweet so the first that I get is like a
very like amber kind of like Central
amber like from everybody works in like
a month
Oh mom she's doing this but this one's
really good I've caught guard because I
thought it was going to smell it all
these but then it smells very like adult
like like no one reveal are you wearing
a 10-hour Katy Perry perfume like it
smells like very or something very
expensive pencil the look like very very
very muted fruit undertones as well I'm
not like sweet I really liked it as a
very sour in a good way smelly when I
smell this I don't think sweet I think
very musky but in a good way because I'm
explaining Italy growth in my feet sour
no no no no it smells really good so we
have Britney Spears fantasy okay I
really for breaking one if you're
curious so badly no one had it couldn't
find it anywhere so I'm on the hunt for
that one next to the no cheers Cheers
curious and fancier lachie's perfumes
like I know eraser is known for like
having good perfume this was $25 at
Marshalls dealing with religion make the
most recent one was $15 so like the
restaurant literally ten - this is
Marshall but this is $25 granted it to
3.30 hours so a little left in Katy
Perry that's children huge I remember
seen a we wanted to kind of a few
minutes we want to hold a little
engraved ransom and like this can what
it hasn't four or five six and so I
never everyone had this and I had the
blue one which was furious
why don't I see sign price today it
doesn't smell anything but boss but
there's a little hotter liquid in it
like this is literally three one two
three half once's so yet twenty five
dollars so please do not let me down I
will be on that period not what you know
what any rep as I find it but tweeting
along from the too literal 2006 printed
like designs on a Pemba well you can
tell them to people but I'm a living
living loving learning laughter let's go
please because $25
okay what for so what are the loving so
loud and so much and say no why am I
like okay
okay I really like this thank goodness
because of expensive it's just really
like spend $150 on Chanel laughs what'd
you put in British reason like that's
funny I was about this okay first either
first things note that hits me is like
very sweet if I thought maybe I could
get pens went to the neighbor first but
then the undertones only kind of like an
adidas oh and like a body lotion all
okay accurate to last long on the skin
it smells really good it smells fruity
but not overpowering or overwhelming or
too sweet and it smells again time ature
what I really appreciate because I don't
really like smelling like you know 14
year old Justin Bieber's fans
so this look kind of it not nothing when
batida parity in scent but kind of
Wisdom occurring in level like you just
know a smell to you with a selfie mode
woman or not a Chanel something old
woman um and you know what just leave ur
doesn't but I really like this like it
smells like an older fume I like it
kind of like a little bit like licorice
and also sweet tarts but like muted
sweetheart so with hope you didn't once
jewellary stick your eyes out with a
knife while watching this in my cringy
reaction and opinions and descriptions
of these casinos but thank you so much
