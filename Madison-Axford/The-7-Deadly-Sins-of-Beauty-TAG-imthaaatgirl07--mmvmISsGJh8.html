well and then my favorites whoa with
hell and i'm almost out of those oh my
gosh my cheeks are ready read enough
yeah this have rocks i'm looking
hydrated AF hey yo so today i'm doing
another fun tag which is the seven
deadly sins of beauty tag and this one
just looked really really clever so
props to whoever created this one cuz
it's amazing and I really really am
interested in this tag and doing it
stuff like that so that's why I'm doing
it today so it's basically the seven
sins and then they like made like
whoever made this made them and do like
questions about beauty products and then
there's just one random question that I
don't about guys but you know we all
love our voice so so anyway without
further ado let's get started number one
is greed and what is your most
inexpensive beauty item and what is your
most expensive and i'm going to show all
products and i bought so I've gotten
like palettes and stuff like that for
Christmas or my birthday but I didn't
particularly by those you know so I'm
not going to show this this is gonna be
stuff that I have bought my own money in
my most inexpensive is my essence long
lasting I pencil it's just black
eyeliner and I absolutely love this and
it's 199 I think at Ulta and I just
really really really am in love with
this it's like my fourth one of these
and I i just am in love with this it's a
roll up and i'm almost out of those oh
my god it's two bucks super cheap and
unless a really really long time even
though this one's almost out I just love
pine this on my waterline and it
completes any look so it's really cheap
and it's really really high quality
eyeliner for sure and the most expensive
product that I bought with my own money
was a Tarte Amazonian clay 12-hour full
coverage foundation i got this when i
got a spray tan for homecoming so I got
an industry light medium sand so when I
tried to use it in like weeks after it
was a group pretty pretty dark you know
but I just went with it and pretended
that I was that tan but anyway this is a
really really great um foundation if you
have like a lot of acne which I
particularly don't thankfully so it was
just really thick on my skin and though
I didn't enjoy it sometimes I don't know
other times I just it was okay it was
way too dark for me and was way way to
sakenley
and my skin isn't very dry so I didn't
need the extra oil and I don't have that
many you know patches of breakouts or
zits I need to cover up I just have some
redness which can be easily you know
covered with any foundation so this was
thirty-eight dollars and I don't know if
I'm gonna buy it again just because of
the reason that i already said and like
I don't really need this is probably for
people who really need cover up and
foundation and thankfully like I said
before I don't oh I'm glad I try this
and because I had really wanted to try
it but the Shane is way too dark for me
is on an everyday basis when I don't
have a spray tan going for me and other
than that I mean it's just like what can
you do with 38 bucks it's going oh well
number two is wrath and it says what
beauty products do you have that you
have a love-hate relationship with and I
chose a product that I'm loving right
now but it's urban decay's drew me in
the old packaging obviously it's just
moisturizing makeup setting spray and I
like this because it really hydrates
your skin but sometimes it causes little
like dots to form in your makeup like if
you spray it you quickly before your
makeup has actually dried then like if
you put on a lot of foundation like more
then it like puts little dots in to your
foundation let make it makes it look
really cakey and kind of weird sometimes
but if you time it right this can be
great and it just gives really nice to
glow and dewy look should you don't
finish your follow us base makeup but
other than that half the time will be
like yes have rocks i'm looking hydrated
AF but other times they'll be like oh
gosh bringing us time to do my makeup
again it's just like it's you just got
you know redo it some parts because
it'll leave little dots or it'll make
your makeup run sometimes but other than
that i'm liking this right now and this
is pretty expensive too but i didn't buy
it so yeah number three is gluttony and
what are your most delicious beauty
products i guessing they met like a lip
product so I'm going with you only lip
products that are where which is the
color reach bombs the lip balms by
l'oreal and he's my favorite i have to
right now but they're both gone i have
karen coral and heavenly barry and i
need to go to the store and get it more
because I lovely thanks so much the only
things I'll wearing my lips besides us
bombs and it tastes fine they don't
really have a taste like sweet or
vanilla you're anything but the color
that's provided and the moisture is
amazing so I indulge in these and then
my favorites whoa with help
sploo number four is sloth what beauty
part gene neglect due to laziness and
that's just bronzer I have this one by
Rimmel which I don't particularly really
love but it's the shin rising Maxie runs
there in Sun shimmer in the shades 001
Sunkiss it's a ginormous bronzer and
it's way too dark i didn't realize that
it was going to be like warren g brown
um i always put it on my temples like in
the morning but I never do contouring
and I wish I could you know have the
time to contour and I really would love
to contour because I can do it I just
never have time to i'm too lazy to do it
mainly and say I really neglect this
when I could add a lot of definition and
you know make my cheekbones really stand
out in my face I don't do that cuz i'm
too lazy and I don't get up early enough
to actually spend the time to contour
and then blend it all out so I just do
my temples and I'm sorry bronzer but I
love you but I'm sorry too lazy number
five is pride in what Peter probably
gives you the most self confidence and
basically I was going to choose
foundation but I was like I know the
thing that I really love is my my lashes
and my mascara so I use extra large
CIL's booster by Lancome eyelash primer
which I am in love with this does
wonders to my eyelashes and they would
be nothing without this without this
primer and then I use great lash lots of
lashes so this combination these two
together provide my lashes with amazing
length volume definition and separate
them that give makeup so black and I
really really really really really love
these together so this makes me have so
much self-confidence I could go out
without any other makeup besides my
mascara and my eyelashes done and that
just really makes me feel special and
that's my favorite feature about myself
is my lashes number six is lust and it's
what attributes do you find most
attractive in the opposite sex and this
is such a random question so I'm all
like in the beauty mode that it's like
talking about boys but you know whatever
I love boys here I always really um
think about what I really care about and
a guy and I'm always just like a little
fuller you're cute but when it really
comes down to it it's a guy who really
cares about his appearance is not sloppy
he's well groomed and he's like takes
care of himself in that washes his face
and stuff like that and also um someone
who obviously is plenty in 90 SI no
genuinely kind and also someone who
believes in God and just has a strong
religion and faith because that really
is big part of my life and so it needs
to be a big part in his and
seven is envied in wit items would you
most like to receive as a gift obviously
it's gonna be something that I don't
have and it's basically the NARS Laguna
bronzer it's just something I wanted for
a long time I used to say the Laguna
bronzer in the orgasm blush now I just
really really really want the Laguna
bronzer because I need a good bronzer
and I don't need a blush i hate blushes
my cheeks are already read enough that
