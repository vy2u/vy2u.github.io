two or three that I actually really
really like and the other ones are just
like hey oh so today i am doing the best
and the worst foundations just overall
it doesn't matter if they're high end or
drugstore yes the best and the worst of
foundations that i have tried on the
problem i have a foundation is just
finding foundation that works because i
find so many sucky ones i'm going to
share with you today but finding good
ones is literally impossible so i might
have included some of these in a
favorites video before and i probably
did like them at the time there's about
two or three that i actually really
really like and the other ones are just
like but anyway without further ado
let's get into the video the first
foundation i have here is actually a BB
cream is the l'oreal magic skin beautify
our BB cream in the shade light I hate
this it comes out white and kind of
grainy and then it matches to your skin
it I don't want how did you to match my
skin tone I wanted to even it out you
know because it is so mine so red and
blotchy so I really go with one of these
kind of things are I just do not like
this it's so so greasy and when you put
it on super super orange and I was like
uh and I didn't know really where I
Puddick swen I put it on his way and
then I like matches or it gets orange
whatever so then I was splashing all
over the place and I couldn't tell where
I already applied it it was a hot mess
so as you can see it comes out white and
then I'm going to blend it in can you
see how orange that is can you see that
do you see how orange that is my skin's
not that orange look I god what oh what
oh it's just so gross so yes this one is
a no-go for me the next one I have is a
Revlon Colorstay 24 hour foundation this
is so sick it does not blend and I use
quite a bit of it because I felt bad
about wasting money I always feel bad
about wasting my money you know because
it's like I weren't
that and now I'm like throwing it away
or not using it but this is so thick
there's like half a left and won't even
come out and you should i love love love
thick really good covering foundations
this it just wouldn't blend it all sat
on top my skin so let me check oh and if
you can see is so thick it doesn't blend
it just literally smears it's just
smearing and it's so thick and gooey
like did you see I am such a problem
with how nations and they're so gross
and then once they dry or oxidized they
get so orange on me like this looks pale
but in a second it turns all orange and
it creases so if you couldn't tell these
are some of the worst donations that I
found next one is another worst or gross
or awful foundation it's the Maybelline
Dream nude air foam oh my god this is so
freaking orange I just don't get this
okay he's with shake it so let's do that
ooh what it doesn't even like spread out
this is disgusting okay this was not a
good foundation to not make you look
dewy it makes you look gross so you
another one of the worst foundations is
my covergirl BB cream if you want to UM
put a foundation review cream on and
then if you look like you have literally
nothing on your face not even light
trying to know nothing on your face this
one to go to I hate this foundation so
much if you can see this it's not even
blending in my skin it's white Oh next
I'll move on to one of the best ones and
it is my covergirl outlet stay fabulous
31 foundation this is my favorite
foundation I've ever tried I love this
one I have it on right now I have it on
every day
it provides such amazing coverage it
covers everything up so I just love this
like this is just going to be so happy
like I love this foundation so much I
think it makes me look really uh go
ahead it doesn't make me look orange it
doesn't make me look pale it gives me
such a great even skin jump the next
one's another one of the worst
foundations it's my Laura Mercier silk
creme foundation okay i went to a
freaking laura mercier coucher and got
like my makeup like done to see which
one would look best on me like white
color no Madison no this is disgusting
it was like fifty dollars and everyone
on YouTube is like I love this stuff it
is amazing no it's it sucks okay it
comes out and it creases like a ton and
I just oh it's just like me to be so mad
cuz I like wasted so much money on this
okay look look at this not blending not
blending fifty dollars oh the
explanation I have is one of my
favorites of all the time it's my tart
foundation however the amount of
comments I get saying how bad this looks
on my skin is literally disturbing
because everyone decides to comment how
bad I luck with this on my skin but I
love this because it's so thing kind of
covers up everything it gives me great
color and and people are just like oh my
god it doesn't match your skin what are
you doing under them I love this because
it's like no other foundation that ever
tried before it's expensive yes like
forty dollars if you're looking for a
great boy foundation if you have a lot
of acne or you have a lot of whatever on
your face scarring whatever definitely
check this out it is a little pricier
that you will get your money's worth out
of how much is in here but if you can
see okay look at my mole and then watch
it just like covered up like there's no
mole there okay um but if you do a bet
at me or anything this is the one to go
to it's so so wonderful the next
foundation I have is my neutrogena skin
clearing foundation with salicylic acid
in it and that's the reason I do love
this foundation um it's a great one
because the cells cells acid if I
Stephanie while covering your skin and
giving awesome awesome coverage I just
love love love how lightweight this one
is and I just love how there's acne
medication like within the foundation
just makes me so happy and most
all these have SPF and then that's
another thing that I love is when
foundations of SPF and that and you're
just like jazz ok I have protected from
the Sun and I've gone through like eight
bottles of that one so it shows you how
much I do love that one and the last
edition i have is not really a great one
or an awful one um I do like it but it
is a little hard to work with sometimes
it gives good coverage it just doesn't
provide a lot of color there's a lot of
different kinds like you can get like a
pink tone wanna yellow tone one whatever
tone you are so I did get a pink tone
one because that's what I am my a very
pink tones but I just don't think this
did me justice so this was a good one
because it's called True Match and
Looney and so it's really lightweight
it's really like shiny been on a bad way
it makes you look Julie and I like that
look usually um and i did include it in
a favorites video because i will use it
i won't use any of the other ones i hate
but i will use this one um if maybe I'm
like trying to rock a pale look that day
but um overall I usually watch one of my
other ones that I listed as my favorites
so this one is it's okay it's okay so
anyway those are my best in where
foundations I hope you enjoyed this
