day you know the itty bitty titty
committee a nice symbol bra would be
fantabuloso that's a little like
scandalous a lot of people think that if
you wear a push-up bra you are
considered a hey-oh so today I'm
really excited because I'm inviting to
this video for literally ever but I
never get around to it
are you thought it would take like a lot
of time and I was just like oh I'll do
that later but it's basically a video
talking about bras and underwear so
unless you're a girl please exit out of
this video but anyway hello ladies um
yes I'm talking about bras and underwear
this is mainly for my younger audiences
so if you're scared to talk to your
friends or your mom or your guardian or
your grandma or whoever you're talking
about this with if you're scared to talk
to them I'm about it I'm your go-to girl
I'm gonna be your YouTube mom for the
day or the ten minutes that you watch
this video okay anyway there's different
types of bras and underwear if you
didn't know and I'm going to go over
them and hopefully give you a little bit
more of an understanding of what what
these crazy undergarments are and let's
hop into the video so the first bride I
have here is just a simple bra it may
not look simple from the outside print
but it's just a totally simple bra on
the inside of the cup so you can see
here there's nothing inside it's just
the cup to cup your boobs you know
so yeah just like plop it on and you're
good to go
these are just great if you're starting
out um if you are in middle school when
you're starting to wear bra just get a
nice simple bra maybe not a crazy one
like this from Victoria's Secret but a
nice simple bra would be fantabuloso and
this is a great alternative to like a
training bra with no cups in it at all
because once you do start getting no
actual boobage
so yes just a simple cup you can see
totally being scientist flat um and yet
simple bra yay
the next Frye hat is a push-up bra and a
lot of people are confused on what a
push-up is it's not to press the guys
well maybe it is in your eyes but it's
just to give your boot
a little extra oomph and lift if they're
a little tiny you know the itty bitty
titty committee and you want to know
make them look spectacular this is why
you have a push-up bra it's just like a
normal cup except for the added cushion
the little cushion right there you get
you understand what I'm saying okay so
that's what a push-up bra is and a lot
of people think that if you wear a
push-up bra you are considered a
uh-huh well you know last one my checked
you can wear push a bra and not sleep
around with a million guys so no this
doesn't make you a thank you then
we have a sports bra this is not a bra
do not wear this under a t-shirt unless
it's a teacher at the gym this is just
to support your boobs so when you're
running or if you lift your way to
working out or whatever the heck you're
doing this active playing sports you
know yeah yeah so when you're working
out there also you know secured and
they're not bouncing around everywhere
and looking really bad um this is great
for you know a gym or if you're running
or whatever you are doing don't wear
this to like school though because why
are you wearing a sports bra underneath
like a tank top no okay no next we have
a strapless bra now this is for when you
are wearing um any top it's like a tank
top and you don't know your straps show
if you're strapped show that's fine but
sometimes some people think it looks a
little tacky so that's when you go with
a strapless bra this is just a nice bra
it's nude which my favorite kind of bras
are nude even if you're wearing a white
shirt a new bra um you can't see but
like you can see a white bra under a
white shirt so just keep that in mind
I love nude bras they are my favorite
strapless boy it's just nice because
like when I'm wearing a tank top I don't
necessarily want my straps to be shown
so you know I have my tank top on and
then you can't see any straps but my
boobs are still protected okay then we
have my infamous sticky boobs
I love sticky boobs so much because when
you are wearing like I don't know a
dress that has like a back cut out or a
tank top that cuts way down on the sides
like big big armpit holes
you're gonna want sticky boobs because
this can substitute for a strapless bra
but the strapless bra usually almost
always has a back to it yeah it always
says back to endless is a sticky
strapless bra it has back to it you can
see that and sometimes people don't want
that to be seen I don't want that to be
seen if I'm wearing a nice dress or cute
little tank top with the back that's
like cut
powdered she or whatever I don't want
you to see my bra you know I don't want
you see that I want you to see nothing
or my back you know so this is a good
alternative it just sticks to your ribs
yes it's called a sticky bra that does
mean that this okay this sticks to your
boob
don't be kind of scared when you take it
off and it you're like why does this
feel so weird because it's got to feel
weird the first time or two that you do
take it off because it's like super
sticky the next thing I have is a bra
lect however this is not a broad do not
wear this and think that you don't have
to wear a bra whether you wear this you
know over strapless bra or over a bra
with straps like a normal bra this isn't
a bra it doesn't have cups to support
you same thing as being dope it may have
cups but it's not a bra this isn't going
to support you if you're doing any
physical activity or any just like
movement in general this is not going to
support you this is a bando okay up
beyond oh okay moving on to underlay
yeah okay so starting with the most
basic basic basic underwear this is just
you know what you just wear maybe on
everyday basis or something - wearing
skinny jeans or leggings or skirts or
something you know this is just what you
wear okay this is just normal
underwear totally normal they cover your
butt they cover your private areas same
as these except these are just silky
ones normal underwear okay they may look
a little grandma but they're normal
underwear totally and completely these
are also normal okay so this is just an
everyday day-to-day basis next and my
things that I like to call my period
pants so when you are on your period
you're not gonna feel like wearing
little thongs or even like those kind of
underwear you're gonna work had a bigger
bigger granny panty underwear so this is
my first pair they literally look like a
pair of grandma underwear I understand
but I'm not gonna like I said I'm not
going to wear stuff like this when I'm
on my period that ain't comfy and that's
not cute
so you know you just want to wear this
whether I'm wearing a better term on I
like to wear these just because they're
just more comfy or bloating in your
cramping anyway probably usually and
yeah you just you know you like to wear
bigger underwear okay
bigger under wear the next thing our
boxer briefs which I don't wear these
under anything that I wear like out I'll
wear these to bed if I were like a big
oversized
I'll usually wear these things and this
these are these are underwear but like I
would not wear these in like like with
jeans or a skirt or something you know I
just wear these to bed it's the only
time I wear them actually but I have
quite a few pairs because they are comfy
and I had tons of oversized shirts so I
like to wear these because I don't just
like to wear oversized shirts and like
underwear I'll put like this on because
they're a little bigger than like just
underwear that's a little like
scandalous um so I like to wear like
boxer briefs boxer shorts they are women
so I'm gonna like immense and from
Ettore secret you can find um tons of
tons tons these at betray secret and
they're just nice and comfy and stretchy
then there's these things called like
cheeky underwear and I don't get and I
don't get these they're like normal
underwear in the front okay a great
grand terrific and then the back it's
like almost regular underwear almost a
thong like what the hell is this I have
this perixx I got for free a Victoria's
Secret but I don't get the point of
these underwear I just don't understand
them it's like why do I want underwear
halfway up my body like wouldn't I just
go do with thongs I want it on my butt
or just normal underwear if I did it I
don't get the point of these at all
they're not for Lightning's because you
can see that there's something halfway
wish up your butt um so yeah you
couldn't either with a song or go with
regular underwear when choosing
underwear like I don't know what I'm
comfortable if you know what this is for
because they're like cheeky and cheeky
underwear the most uncomfortable
underwear and lastly we have my favorite
underwear and these are my favorite
because it's the most comfortable for me
and the most versatile with the things
that I wear and I just like these
because I don't worry about underwear
lines showing so I have many different
types of thongs we have these which are
my apparently super skanky thongs okay I
got these and they were like a dollar at
Wet Seal or something and this was like
the first oh my god and I was just like
you Yas but I just wear these um with
leggings you know whatever this print is
a little wild so you have to be careful
when you're wearing like a skirt that
you can't like see through the skirt and
see these just a really really basic
thong it's a little thicker right here
than like this one but this one on these
types of things are ply my favorite
because they're string bikini string
thongs and you cannot see this line at
whatsoever when you're wearing leggings
the song party that goes up your butt
this spark right the little line it's
not uncomfortable at all because it's so
thin that if I doesn't feel
uncomfortable because some like this one
I love this one but it's a little
thicker right here so it's like it does
feel like something is there all the
time you don't get like this one I'm
totally used to and I'm pleased to all
the thongs but like I'm talking about
you like when you're starting out if you
have more song before it might feel a
little uncomfortable you know while this
one another string bikini one you're not
gonna feel as much because this little
thing is so soap thin so string bikini
filling and yes so I hope you enjoyed
this video it wasn't too awkward TMI
weird gross but I mean ladies you got to
talk about it it may be awkward to talk
about with your mother guardian whatever
um so this why I'm here because I am NOT
embarrassed easily and I can talk about
these things so I hope this video helped

when to wear what with what and what
bras or underwear just were in general
