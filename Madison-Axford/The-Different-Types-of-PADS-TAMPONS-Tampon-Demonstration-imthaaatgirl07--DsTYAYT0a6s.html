about the different types of tampons and
pads periods are something every girl
the most part goes through um so yeah
this is kind of like the wrong underwear
video if you're sensitive towards these
touchy topics or you're just like weird
about talking about them don't watch
this video I understand people's
different stances on topics like tampons
or pads or periods or underwear thongs
or whatever I get that then don't click
on this video you obviously click on
this video to get pissed off if you're
one of those people
so buy zooms watch if you don't like me
don't watch you don't wanna hear my
opinion don't watch there's so many you
know my brother my video is my most
viewed video thank you but and same time
to show much hate still on it I'm like
this was two years ago like let's move
on but yeah this is about tables and
pads if you don't have a mom um if you
don't have a close relationship with mom
if you are scared of awkward towards
talking about these topics and you know
we come to the Internet for a lot of
things here hopefully this video will
help you in some way shape or form
because I know like I'm very thankful
for my mom and she like told me which
kind of pads or which kind of tampons to
use or start out with or what kind of
days or what kind of flow heaviness you
know stuff like that let you talk me
through it I had great group of friends
who helped me do it who got periods for
etics I got my period when I was 17 so
I'm very very late bloomer I've
literally only had for two years but I
do know my way around tampons and pads
now anyway that being said if you are
just confused and you don't talk about
this aqua topic it is awkward I don't
think it is but a lot of people do until
you become like I guess super secure
with yourself it hoody says like oh I'm
in their period I mean I'm on my period
right now but most people don't say that
hopefully you get something out of this
video and you take away something a new
that you may not known or a lot of new
knowledge or information at that time
it's a pen if you already have your
period one time you just here like prove
me wrong about what a pad is cold or
sore name sign by anyway without further
ado let's get started with the video I'm
gonna start Pat's because that's what I
personally started out with I don't
think anyone really should start with
tampons the first time to get the period
templates are a scary pointy things that
are injected into you why would you want
start out with that let's just start out
with a diaper right we started out like
that one
maybe so let's do it again there are a
lot of different choices for pads really
an endless amount of pads pads are great
because you cannot get an infection or a
serious disease like toxic toxic shock
syndrome from pads however they feel
kind of gross you are sitting in blood
unless you're frequently frequently
frequently changing them but you don't
waste them again pads any tampons are
expensive and it sucks we should get
them for free because we didn't ask for
these periods but you know we can anyway
so there are many different types of
pads and ten Matthews I'm I started pads
like I said um the most basic kind is
honestly just this it's like a normal I
don't know it's called maxi or wet but
it's just like a normal pad there's
wings and no wings wings or little flaps
that you wrap around the bottom of your
underwear kind of more like your vagina
is you wrap it around the opposite side
up to your outer part of the underwear
and usually when I wear pads I will just
wear a normal underwear this is by the
brand always these are my favorites
because I actually hate wings wings are
good because they protect from leaks if
it does if you don't have time change it
a rubber and your blood starts to go
over the side the wings are usually
there to catch it before it gets on
underwear pants etc um I don't like
wings because they always get kind of
like screwed up and they stick to my leg
I don't know they just never work for me
so I choose um this pad without wings
these are the kind of pads all where if
I'm not going out a lot just laying
around the house whatever I'm not going
to like stick tampon to me when it's not
necessary
I prefer tampons or pads any day but
sometimes it can be scary sometimes it
can be confusing etc so Pat's like this
are just good when you're lounge around
the house on the heavier days because
they do have a lot of cushioning so you
just pull it off the back like that and
it is sticky and you put it right in
whatever underwear you are currently
wearing days one two and three are you
sure your heaviest for five and six
up to seven are lighter also I decided
goes out there a period blood is usually
round the first and last day especially
when you're new to having your period so
don't be alarmed by that it's not always
going to be red you're going to see the
most grossest things come out and that's
normal I'm sorry that we have to talk
like that but it's true don't be alarmed
if you do if your blood is brown that's
just old blood that's coming out don't
be alarmed I decided to throw it out
there cuz when that first happened to me
I was like the focus right
but anyway so this just honestly the
most basic pad there is next we have
this pink one this is a thin umm normal
pad so it is kind of normal length it is
long and this one does have wings see it
is quite a big pad but it is very very
thin so this is on like days one or days
like five six
because here's the wings okay right so
these are the parts that would flip over
and like if the pink thing is your
underwear there was go on the outside so
you think it will tangle I hate wings
but you put them like that and they have
stickiness on them at sticks the
underwear therefore if the blood leaks
over onto this it should catch it for
the most part anyway this is very very
thin there's not extra cushioning like
there is a lot of thick cushioning in
this first one which that's why I prefer
that one if like you have a clot or if
things are very heavy that day you don't
even know about it that will save it in
there's many layers that it can soak
through before it gets your underwear
whereas this is very thin so I'd say on
your last few days you can wear this or
you could opt out for a panty liner
which is literally this but a lot
shorter this as wings this is meant for
instantly like heavy flow but at the
same time you should be changing these
quickly because it is very thin a panty
liner is the most basic you can get it
is super shiny fits in just the base of
your underwear as no wings and it looks
like this like it does not hold that
much but did you for the days that you
think your periods over but then like
some spotting happens and just like ah
then you put one of these in so it just
comes off in the back of this paper and
there you go it literally does not go up
the front of your underwear the back
yonder where does not flip around to the
sides of flaps it is just the most basic
thing and you cannot see this at all
another thing with this you always feel
like you can see your pad and you always
feel like you're leaking through but
you're not you can't really ever see a
pad unless you're wearing like leggings
and a pad but with jeans you always feel
like oh my god a friend can you check me
shirmat leaking a friend keep checking
make sure you can't seem like the Bulge
or my pad
people always ask that um as a girl I
always ask my friends that you know and
if I'm wearing a pad and they let's me
the same because it is awkward you feel
like you people can see it but most more
often like that every sometime you
cannot see even though it feels like you
can but this is a panty liner so even if
I'm wearing tampons sometimes I'll just
wear this just in case I don't have like
it's a long day or I'm going to make you
a bathroom to change in time
and the tampon would leak then I would
have this just as a little security
blanket
if the tampon for some reason did get
full but that's very very rare because
you got up on the right tampon size for
your flow anyway moving on we have in
this orange one which this is a very
very thick large maxi de pad and then I
have a thick maxi large night pad but
anyway so this is orange
my favorite brand pads are always in my
favorite brand of tampons or Tampax just
thought I'd let you know you will find
your favorites throughout your
trial-and-error years of finding them so
anyway this is a super super large yes
it looks like a diaper I know move on it
has no wings this is basically the night
pad for daytime so if you have a super
heavy Flo um like it's incredibly heavy
and you can't even make it feel like a
class or an hour without having to
change it this would be the one for you
it's like the yellow I previously showed
which this is my favorite but that much
longer look how much bigger it is so I
would definitely recommend wearing jeans
with this before anything else if you're
gonna wear a pattern a pair and wear
jeans like don't try to do a skirt don't
do leggings hope you enjoy that then you
and I put him on it cuz I'll see this in
leggings this is literally in the night
pad which here I have in the night pad
which when iPads are amazing so let me
just finish up on this yet this is if
you have two prints well I pass art look
disgusting but they're amazing because
in the night you roll around you flip
sides you're upside down you're jumping
above that link you don't know what
you're doing during the night and so
this just protects you at all angles
it's gross I'm sorry it's into our
videos gross but it's brutally honest
like I'm not gonna be like only weighs
10 pounds like no yes sometimes you wear
pads and at night you should not wear 10
buttons you can you know where for 8
hours but I just want to trust that but
if you don't wake up but if something
happens what's your long just go off you
sleep through with the eight hours toxic
shock syndrome can happen I'll talk
about that later in the video anyway
this is a night pad this is the type of
it's more wide in the bottom is not
clear if that little thing up so you put
this at the top of your underwear like
the very top not just like buy it like
we're vagina is like the top of your
underwear and then this flaps over the
first party under where it goes down is
literally five pads in one seriously
this is the back and then it flips out
and this folds into the back of your
underwear so where your butt is and your
underwear covers that this should be
spread out because blood sometimes does
go up towards your butt and your back is
discussing yet sick shower put a towel
down more other than that I would swear
this to bed my friends
I suggest a lot of people wear this it's
gross is ugly but I mean who needs to
see you in a new period sleeping like
seriously just put this on and you avoid
a whole lot of mess that could possibly
happen
the last pad is the song pad they need
my favorite types of pads because
they're just like panty liners on your
last day if you want to wear leggings
you know it's about damn time
here you go put this in your underwear
it has flaps just folds like this over
and you the little g-string of your song
and then it goes in the front you can't
see it you can't feel it it's perfect I
also will sometimes words for the tampon
again if I have a long day and I might
not make it to a bathroom in time for
something I might leak out just in case
I don't wanna stay in underwear so even
though period blood just come on
underwear it does don't worry put some
locks to clean on it it's fine but I
just pull sometimes wear this just in
case and it's just nice like I said
security blanket just in case it's just
like a panty liner and always is the
only read I've seen make foam pads this
is the greates image you never I don't
know why more companies wouldn't make
freakin foam pads because every girl
wears songs for the most part I mean if
you don't wear thongs it's totally fine
but every girl I know wears this long as
I'm like white would you come on this is
a great invention the only one pad
company makes like come on guys okay so
yes thumb hat always amazing moving on
to the favorite topic ever tampons
sterilizing tampons um I have three I
have a light one which is the smallest
one you can get a regular like a medium
sized one and then I have been super I
think there's also a Super Plus which is
so big I don't need it though it's just
because my flow isn't that heavy I don't
need ones that's like that big so we
stick with these three beauties string
with first one although okay this is a
few helpful hints tampons have
expiration dates there's a lot of scary
things that can have ones and ones you
have to use them properly they say you
can keep them in for eight hours
I only usually keep mine in for six
hours just in case because it freaks me
out to think that these could kill me
like you could get toxic toxic shock
Center which can make you very sick
which then can lead to death possibly in
a scary scary side effect when really
you could just do a pad but it's easier
more than often normal not to wear
tampon when you're wearing leggings
certain clothes when you're going out
when they when you're with a guy when
you're going swimming soul mate things
pop up where tampons are just so much
easier to use than pads and they they're
hidden a lot easier you know because
they're up you and not on it underwear
wait the first one I'm starting out with
Tampax light this is what I start out
with I could not understand tampons the
first time I got in just kinda like bend
down and like tilted upwards because you
can't tilt it straight back straight
down straight up because the way you're
like vagina set up everyone's vagina
you can't just like shove it in has to
go in at like an angle kind of pointing
to at the back lower back yet your lower
back so kind of up like this you can see
kind of like an escalator it's going up
um and I didn't get it because I didn't
like know how a vagina worked apparently
but it's really easy if you just trust
that your vagina's normal everyone's
agenda is different but everyone's
agenda is normal and you know that these
are supposed to like go in like no if
you don't use tampons that's not wrong
like they're totally fine you know used
and ones if you want don't you see ones
if you want they're both fine like
there's that's why we have multiple
options
oh yeah there's also menstrual cups I
don't deal with that because I'm
not like bending that silicone cup to
put it in and then rinsing out my blend
the sink that's disgusting I'm not doing
with that so we're gonna do this
okay
anyway I didn't understand how to use
tampons at first because I like didn't
know where to like not where to put it
anywhere to put it but if you know what
I mean it's just very scary and
confusing the first time is why there's
numerous videos how to put one in online
so I'm gonna pretend that this is where
you're putting it okay you don't want to
put it straight back you don't want to
put it straight up because that just
won't go anywhere so what you're going
to do is you're going to put it as
slight angle like this okay slight angle
up everyone's vagina is shape whoa get
back in there we're not ready for you to
come out everyone's trying to shape
differently so you might have yours turn
more left or more right or whatever you
add a wiggle it a little bit around it's
gonna take some time you know she can be
like oh my god perfect I'm amazing
tampon cutter enter no it doesn't work
that easily so it is going to take a
little bit but once you get it in like
it's so much easier to get your period
it's so much simpler you don't to worry
about the mess all the time I'm
literally still holding my vagina finger
but you know it's so much easier once
you can hang a tampons anyway look I'm
talking so much so you got to put it in
like a little up like an escalator and
then this is where you have the grip of
your fingers so there's like this little
nodule that you put I use my middle
finger my thumb start putting it up and
you put it here so this is outside your
vagina and you're putting in your ping
and you're putting in your pinion in
that's not where you stop you only stop
when your finger your thumb in your milk
like almost inside of jail like you have
to like really get it up there otherwise
it can be uncomfortable and you can feel
it if you can feel your tampon you did
it wrong you're not supposed to feel it
these are made so you can't feel them so
they're comfy so once it's like your
middle finger in your thumb are kind of
like touching the entrance to your
vagina that's when you take your pointer
finger and you push this all the way in
and then the cotton comes out and it
like goes up into your vagina and then
there it is and you have that can go
then you have this up in you and this is
kind of a neat yeah this isn't you as
well and then part of this braid sticks
out of the braid is meant to trap me
blood that might fall out or spill out
and this is also what you pull when you
try to get your tampon out when I first
got my tampon out it felt weird because
there was not enough blood in it if it's
soaked and ready to come out it'll just
slide right out but if it's so mainly
cotton and on the fluid or blood isn't
it it might take a little bit to pull
out it feels really weird honestly every
time you do it but it's fine it's just
this gotta come out do not leave it in
for more than eight hours again I leave
it leave it in for six this my mom
always taught me just in case you know
so then what's step you pull out and
then this is what it looks like when
it's filled with liquid so when it is
filled with your blood and you pull it
out or it's not and you put it in the
toilet water at these go in the toilet
you flush them then this is what it will
look like when it expands it is full
this is the light smallest one there is
an es it doesn't hold that much but on
your latter days this is what I would
use we have regular tampons these are
the ones I always use because my flow is
heavy but not so heavy that I need you
super really ever it's very rare I use
one of these since very rare I use a
light one besides my last day but I'll
usually use these these are the perfect
size for me again goes in yeah if you're
putting it in and it hurts that's not
right
take it out how much should not hurt and
you should not be able to feel it like
if the tampon is hurting take it out try
again like do not do not keep pushing
because obviously you're not at the
right angle you're not at the right
place like something is wrong and I'll
even still do that sometimes really
glass not going in like sometimes it
will not go in you just gotta take it
out take breath and try again you have
to be relaxed down there because
otherwise the muscles will clench up and
they won't let some foreign object come
in but if you're relaxed then it will go
in let it push look okay and this is
what a regular tampon looks like spread
out little bigger okay the last thing we
have today is the super tampon these are
my code
Beks I think they're colorful they're
cute whatever you rip it open and then
these was super so it is bigger I
absolutely adore
I don't adore but you know the plastic
tampons I don't know why people would do
cardboard they still sell them but like
carpet is just hard it's not smooth it
doesn't glide in she does everything
more difficult so if you can't afford it
and if you can manage to get the plastic
ones try to get that because there's so
much smoother and the insert of them
it's so much easier this is super again
they're just bigger and the Kotex is a
little different there's like a little
clear thing but again put your thumb and
little finger there and then it expands
into the super sorry I don't have super
plus that's for very very heavy flows
and I don't have that time sorry I don't
have it to show
I hope tell me one way shape or form it
was not trying to grow so I was not
trying to sell or anything but I wish I
had a video like this that explains so
in depth of every pad and tampon really
that there is when I was starting my
period and when I was so confused add so
many questions and like I am very
thankful from my mom and my friends who
pushed me through it but you know
sometimes it's awkward to ask and you
just want like to be by yourself and be
like okay that's that Pat's word that's
what the tampon is that I put a tampon
in because sometimes is confusing and
it's hard being girls you know us girls
we have stick together but I hope you
enjoyed this video if you're not a
