asked often like so much because i am
very daring with my style i can easily
leave there without buying something I
don't like have to buy something every
time I leave my house and go to a store
a little dress and like flip-flops cuz
you can slide us off and slide them
right on i'm not really scared to show
who I am heyo so today I'm doing a tag
which is the shopaholic tag and it looks
really fun and I just I love tag so much
they're so cute i love answering the
questions and you can i get to know more
about me through these random questions
that are asked in the jacks you know so
anyways let's get on with a shopaholic
tech question 1 would you consider
yourself a shopaholic even though i am a
beauty guru I don't really consider
myself a shopaholic just because I feel
like I have a really good grasp on how
to save money and what I really want to
spend money on so if i go to store i can
easily leave there without buying
something I don't like have to buy
something every time I leave my house
and go to a store you know it's not that
hard for me if I see something I really
love obviously you know i'll buy it if i
really love it i'm not saying that I
never buy things but I have a good grasp
on you know when to use my debit card
and when to spend money and when I
shouldn't so I don't think I'm
relationship a hell-like I love to go
shopping i love spend money and i love
to buy things but i'm not really
shopaholic at all question number two
how would you classify your style I
guess mismatch I literally put anything
and everything together so that's the
main thing I would say to describe my
style number three what store can you
not leave without buying at least one
thing like i said before i can leave
anywhere without buying things but i
love forever 21 um I really have to dig
to find stuff in there but once I do I
can find a lot question 4 where do you
find the best deals forever 21 even
though the prices have skyrocketed since
like 2010 and that's about it pretty
much you like my size shops so yeah
furniture one is where you find a lot of
good deals for the clothes that I like
to wear like urban outfitters they don't
we don't really have a good deals
victori cigarette not really good deals
but you know forever 21 ever you know
how everything ends an 80 like what is
that like something a t10 8980 number
five what designer are you willing to
splurge for uh Steve Madden not out
there buying like Louboutins stuff like
that I
have a few steve madden purses and
likely leaflets doing stuff like that I
don't know if those are huge larges but
I don't really spend that much on like
high-end things not at all i don't i
don't buy hanging things number six do
you have a go to shopping outfit i do
but i never wear i always wear like the
most horrible thing to work shopping I
wear like Lisa boots socks um jeans like
five layers of top like literally I
where the most uncomfortable thing or
something that's extremely difficult in
like time consuming when I go into a
dressing room because you know you want
to be quick and fast and you know you
don't want to have something that like
is really hard to get off and then put
back on so my go-to of it will probably
be like a little dress and like
flip-flops cuz you can slide us off and
slide them right on so you know you
don't have to like spend 10 days getting
things on and off number 7 what is your
guilty pleasure not including makeup
probably shoes I love shoes and
charlotte russe has many good deals on
shoes I don't really buy a lot of purses
or anything like that but I do spend a
lot of on makeup that says excluding
makeup so it has to be heels I love
shoes definitely heals number 8 what is
one staple clothing piece that you
cannot live without leggings black
leggings oh my god I I wear them every
day every day is my with the temperature
every day it's kind of sad but I love
them number nine what does a trendy hope
never goes out of style um black
leggings in the winter um like I don't
really follow trends I'll get some
things that represent trends that are
you know new and up-to-date but I'm not
like a trend girl that does everything
with trends so there's not one thing
that I'm like hoping and praying that
doesn't go out of style excite I don't
really follow things that intimately so
number 10 what trend did you love that
past way to quickly probably color
blocking I love color block in sweaters
and just in jeans and like everything I
thought it was beautiful and I just
loved it and I mean still in its not out
or anything but you can tell that people
really don't really look for that in
stores anymore and it's not shown in
stores or magazines or and like you know
on the models in stores anymore it's not
really as as popular most famous as it
used to be but it was really big I don't
know last year or earlier this year and
i loved it i don't really have much that
is color-block but the things i do i
love and i wear them
stantly but i really wouldn't really
really way to vest and number 11 who is
your fashion icon it I get this asked
often like so much because i am very
daring with my style i'm not really
scared to show who I am and and I'm not
scared to wear certain things honestly
my style is like bohemian and classic
stylish so like smashing them together
is like a really random jake-style my
classic though I would have to say is
Marilyn Monroe and Audrey Hepburn um era
because those two are just timeless
beauties and I look to them for
everything their fashion sense is
amazing and they weren't scared to show
what they had you know if longish stuff
and and I'm not saying I'm like that but
I'm definitely confident in what I wear
and I feel good when I wear um but the
more bohemian style I don't really know
where I get that from I just kind of
like the more earthy ish looking clothes
and I really just like wearing whatever
I feel like I'm mismatching whatever I
went to like I'm really just use my
inner fashionista diva to figure out
what I'm gonna wear that day because I
don't really look to someone I look for
magazine refers to Bashar pop star
whatever movie start you know for a
fashion sense I don't really follow some
style there's no one that I really look
up to or really follow as my fashion
icon or anything like that I don't
really have one you know so anyway that
was the shuttle holic tag I hope you
