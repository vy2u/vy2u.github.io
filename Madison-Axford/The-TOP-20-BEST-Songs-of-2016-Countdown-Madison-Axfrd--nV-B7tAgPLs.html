songs for the year 2016 I know I did
these videos all throughout the year I
adore doing these videos my favorite
type of videos because I love talking
about music listening to music sharing
music blah blah blah and so umm yeah I
thought it would do a over-arching at 20
best songs from a countdown from 20 to 1
this is my personal preference on this
your songs that I know I've been big or
that have made a big influence or impact
in their specific genre of music it
doesn't matter if they were tab 1 or 2
an iTunes chart or streamed a billion
times a day this is personally my idea
of how I would mark the top 20 songs and
the most influential of 2016 so if you
agree that's great if you don't you
don't need to leave hate comments or
freak out because your favorite artist
was marked lower than a different one or
isn't on here
I appreciate all chase music but some of
these songs I don't even like really
like any more Cubans over plates the top
20 songs in my opinion for 2016 it has
come to a close was an amazing year for
music so without further ado let's get
started it's funny it's one from our PLC
song - that's okay I was doing just fine
before I met you I drink too much and
that's an issue okay tell your friends a
nice to meet them but never see
of you over
Monty my partner I feel the Polynesia
savory likes
okay ha ha ha whistle I just like you a
long way to to be wrong
Alton common hospital arm-wrestle
clarified baby this is what you came for
stripes every time too and everybody's
watching her
I was
Oh
 flop around to do
just like to cry
Oh Jim
you see
train car I wish I didn't have to rhyme
every time save up for the only someone
because of my mother we have the same
nose same clothes homegrown a stone's
throw from frequent who should concern
back time to the good old days
my life
come we have to change shake what where
where where where where see me there
there there like nobody that the real
Joe you don't know why he's on my vision
you tonight I'm Allie but every night
you little bee
Oh

right now

sign

girl like me I just wanted you to

like me and Taylor my still has sex why

famous I just wanted you john-boy

armor in your booby prize possessions
