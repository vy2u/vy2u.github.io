about applying for a job getting a job
interview questions teen jobs and stuff
like that because I've gotten a request
um everyone who requested about certain
questions electric interviews and stuff
like that I have been through three
interviews and I've had two jobs in my
life besides volunteering and YouTube I
don't count those cuz I didn't interview
for those but yeah so I think I have a
little bit of knowledge on the subjects
I'm not like an interview person but I
have been through three so I think I
know a little bit about what they're
gonna ask and what they look for
and we should apply so if you didn't
know I work at Redco now and I also um
so I interviewed up for bread Co Panera
where ever you want to call it um and I
also worked at a store gap so interview
for them and I also interviewed at
francesca's but they never called me
back so I'm rude first off I know it's
different for every stage or whatever
but um live online for your state how
old you have to be to apply for a job in
Nazari where I live at 16 but I know
some places can maybe fifteen or if you
have a work permit from school or
whatever you can be fifteen uh
chick-fil-a does hires a fifteen but
anyway most places hire at sixteen and
places at my mall and um really like big
retail stores or Sephora or alter
forever 21
hire at eighteen which sucks because I'm
17 and I all my friends are basically
seventeen except now we're all turning
18 this year but anyway so it sucks
because Shores that I really like I
can't get a job at because I don't know
why it's just Missouri if it's
everywhere um but they won't hire until
you're 18 so nothing's moved back to my
age 17 most people hire at sixteen so
between age of sixty eight seventeen you
have a lot of places that you can work
food places in particular in when I
started job searching I was like there
is no way I would ever work in a food
and I'm working in food but I love bread
Co so much and I would never have it any
other way so once I kind of did a little
searching and filled out a few
applications for Redco in this resale
shop in my town which they never called
me either I got called back for bread
code I would recommend going in to the
actual store or restaurant wherever
you're applying and talk to the manager
and be like I can show to a manager and
then the manager will come out and be
like hi my name is blank and I was
wondering if you are hiring I would love
to work here and then if they're like oh
no we're not hiring at this time be like
okay thanks anyway and then come back
later or look somewhere else but if they
are hiring ask if you can have an
application they'll either give you an
application or a bread code they give
you like this little card and then you
can go online and fill out application
they'll call you back but it's not
guarantee that you'll be called back
once you fill in the application once
you turn to application even if you talk
with a manager there's no guarantee that
you'll be cloned back um however if you
are that's great and then you'll
probably be set up for an interview and
 and that doesn't mean that you got
the job or not that's just to see if
you're like normal if they want to hire
you you know um an interviews just see
what kind of person you are and test you
with like all these different kind of
questions so you may be wondering what
kind of questions they ask in doing an
interview and believe me when I was job
hunting job search and I liked up on
Google every day what kind of questions
they asked I would ask my friends what
kind of questions they were asked if
they apply to write court or if they
applied it anywhere else and um the main
questions they asked are like well this
is for my experience um you typically
have to put a few references down on
your application so they'll be like um
if we called one of your references what
would they say about you and don't be
afraid to brag on yourself just be like
I'm a hard-working caring happy I would
never bring a bad mood to the workplace
you know say things like that really
butter them up and make yourself look
good I mean don't say things that are
false don't go in there and lie but say
things that are honest and portray
yourself is a really good person if
they're true you know don't go in their
life but um you know don't go in their
life that's that - ask about any past
leadership skills or situations or
scenarios where you've had to be a
bigger person at what you did or why you
would be better than any other applicant
applying for the same position of the
same
you um what you think is good customer
service what would you do if you see
someone stealing an item what would you
do if there's a fight between employees
sort of questions like that what are the
five best qualities about you and what's
something that you would like to improve
on and good answer for like a bad
quality about yourself is that you try
too hard that's what I always say
because um you're not gonna be like oh
I'm late Oh time or don't like work no
no you won't be hired but I'm gonna
think to say for a bad politics you
don't actually want to say that you want
to have a good quality that kind of is
in a bad light which is like trying too
hard like I am a perfectionist honestly
and so if I go to an interview and they
asked me what's a bad quality about
myself I say that I am a perfectionist I
want everything to be 100% perfect and
that can be a good thing you know cuz I
don't want to give out crappy work um in
my workplace but then again like
sometimes I try way too hard and it
takes me longer like longer do things
because I wanted to be perfect so
obviously it's a good thing but
sometimes people can see that it's a bad
thing and that's why that's what I
personally say for my bad quality but
you'll be asked that and I'm going off
my experiences at brento gap at
Francesca's so you know this might be
different or it will be different
probably at every workplace but it's
just kind of the similar same questions
that you'll hear over and over again the
more interviews you go through they'll
also ask you why you're applying here
what you like about this specific place
and they might even ask you what you
know about the company because I was
asked that and read cowing gap you're
like how do you see gap style or what do
you think of bread code what's the first
thing that pops into your mind stuff
like that so know a little bit about
your company or job that you're applying
for don't go in there like into a sports
place you don't know anything about
sports don't go to Sephora if you don't
know what eyeliner is you know kind of
have a little bit of knowledge also a
little tip is if you're leaving a job
and they ask you why you're leaving that
position that job that place do not say
something negative don't be like I don't
like my boss I mean are the employees
are so annoying they don't get breaks
they pay minimum wage even if that may
be true even if that is the factors you
not say that because why would they hire
someone who's complaining about that
when you may have the same problems at
this workplace say something kind of
positive or really positive like when I
left bread Co for three months and went
to gap um they would ask me why and I
was like I I love bread Co I loved bread
Co and I still do and I and I really
enjoyed and valued my time work
there but I want to step away from the
food business for a little bit because I
love fashion and beauty so much that I
love and experience in the fashion
retail industry like gab like
Francesca's and that was true that was
honest I wasn't making that up but it
looks better than if I had a problem
with an employer breakup which I didn't
but if I did I wouldn't say that to a
new possible manager at an interview
just because it looks really shady and
bad on your part going back to what I
said you have references on your
application sheet these are people that
aren't in your family people who
genuinely like you I hope we're out for
them as a reference but it's people that
you've known for a long time who you've
previously worked with or volunteered
for or closely friends that would
definitely definitely give you a good
recommendation and it would definitely
make you look good um if they were asked
or called by your possible interviewer
or employer also make sure you notify
your references otherwise if they get
called they'll be like what is this just
make sure that they know that you put
them down in case that's you know your
employer or interviewer did call them
and they weren't caught off guard and
they would know what to say a resume
always helps it's definitely not
necessary especially for fast food
places where fashion retailers you know
for bigger real jobs it might be but for
little teenager jobs or teen jobs or
whatever you want to college on even
though it may be someone's livelihood
I'm not saying that I'm not like
downgrading butene jobs you don't really
need to go in there with like full page
resume and a cover letter just because I
don't think that's necessary for the
kinds of jobs that I millions of other
teens dangers apply it you know so when
I go into bread Co not gonna bring in a
resume of all the things that I've done
and all the work that I've done I might
mention a few things during the
interview or you know to my manager or
future manager but I'm not going to say
like create a resume or that you can and
if you do make sure you spell check and
make sure there are no errors
grammatical or spelling or whatever
because if there's errors your letter
will literally get tossed in the trash
and will not be looked at so make sure
you proofread that thing a billion times
make sure other people prefer that a
billion times if you're actually going
to take a resume into a job like this
when you're in the interview make sure
you shake hands introduce yourself say
your full name not your building but you
know your first and last name thank them
again for having you when you leave
when they ask you do you have any
questions comments or concerns don't say
no if you say no you don't really sound
like you care that much even if you do
it just say something create any
question what I always ask is is there
anything that would prevent us from
working together in the future you know
if there is a problem that's on their
mind or a conflict that they know
they're not going to hire you for ask
them you know to make sure there's no
like hesitancy towards hiring you so be
like is there anything that would
prevent us from working together or be
like what are the hours like you know
stuff like that what is the uniform like
just simple questions to make sure that
you're on point driver forget to brag on
yourself again don't do it in a rude way
but make sure you're putting yourself in
the spotlight and you look like a really
good employee I was really confused when
I was first applying for jobs and trying
to look for jobs get a team job it's
seriously great I've had the best
experience at redcoat ever you make tons
of new friends and you make money doing
it so you can save your money spend it
whatever you want to do but a team job
is definitely worth it so look into
different places around your area or
your state if you can apply it 15 16 17
whatever you can apply I don't know
about you we can apply at 16 like I said
in Missouri some places 15 whatever and
look for a job
don't be so job on whether or not you
get paid a lot you know even though
that's a benefit base the job on it
whether or not it's saying you're going
like I didn't think I like bread cook
once I give it a chance didn't judge it
by its cover I knew that I loved the
food and once I went through the
interview I knew I would love it there
and I definitely definitely do me and
gap didn't really work out but that's
another story in Francesco's never
called me so anyway if you're not
already taking over to subscribe to my
channel and become a fierce and
confident diva like me and the rest of
us on here and check back later for more
videos thanks for watching bye around
the Ornish
temper the cabins and grounds and and do
little errands for my mother
once she allows I might be capable of
doing don't you go out with rent</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
