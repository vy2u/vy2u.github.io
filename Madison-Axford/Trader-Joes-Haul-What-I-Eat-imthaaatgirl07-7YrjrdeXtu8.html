anything that's not organic
hey guys so today I'm doing a different
video from for my channel it's a food
hall and it's all from trader joes I
went there earlier today and when I got
back just now I thought know why not do
a video with what I got you guys can see
what food I'm eating cuz i usually don't
eat healthy that sounds awful i know but
i usually don't i'm really bad at eating
healthy i've seen a lot of carbs and
starch so it's good to get some healthy
snacks I didn't go there and get like
chicken and stuff I got like snack items
so I don't just sit around and eat like
crackers chips goldfish cheezits these
are more healthy so yes that further
dudes get into my tree to jay's haul
look on my bag the first thing I got I'm
gonna have for lunch after this video
it's a Fuji apple I usually just cut
these up I have a little apple cutter um
slicer thing and I'll eat it with some
peanut butter so I picked up an apple I
usually don't make up like produce when
I go to trader joes um just because i
always get snacks and those like my
favorite store for snacks but i thought
i would get Naville this time because it
was sixty seventy cents maybe um and I
just knew that I wanted to eat this when
I got home so i'll wash that and then
eat that but that's what I got first and
then okay so i might already cracked
into these and started snacking like on
a hundred of them but this is my
favorite absolute absolute absolute
favorite snack from trader joes it's
chan jose enterpise aya freaking love
these things i think i had it at
favorites video before i love these so
much oh my god they're just like a green
peas and I thought crunchy dehydrated
baked whatever I don't know they made
happy that least thing none of this
stuff maybe the healthiest but it's
amazing I've tried most this before so
um I love the apple I've had an apple
before I just love these so much and yes
i'm sorry that i already opened them but
I like could it wait like I was like I
take my pace so yes I love these I just
you need to go try these things they're
only like a doll or something and i wish
i could have got more than one pack mmm
but i didn't so if you've chosen your
you try to find these by the next thing
I picked up it's something I've also
tried before
and they're trying to chose honey wheat
pretzel sticks I love these again
there's so much better than regular
pencil sticks if you get the honey wheat
I had them before I start shopping at
trader joe's from life a local grocery
store maybe but I love honey wheat
pretzels they're so amazing and sweet
and there's great and i love the trade
shows kind especially again they're like
a doll or something they're so cheap I
thought terios was a lot more expensive
than this but every time I go there I
remember how actually affordable it is
and can be um yes I got these is just a
healthy I'll chart if you don't want to
snack on like a bag of ways like that's
disgusting this house go bad so get
pretzels appease forever next I got
multi grain pita chips never Chinese
before but it looks good i was going to
get the pita chips with like vinegar or
something on them maybe minute your herb
stuff i don't know but i decided to get
a multi grain with sesame seeds they
just seemed again healthier and i feel
like my taste buds would like this
better than the other one i always want
to try new things like herb vegetable
pita chips but like I don't feel like I
i would eat like I i would eat like two
and then that like it these I feel like
they're more neutral taste that I can
like continuously eat and finish the bag
so I think he's up then I think they're
clipboards run sale because there were
99 cents and I've never seen cliff bars
so cheap and I got chocolate chip peanut
crunch in chocolate brownie and I've had
the chocolate brownie before but there's
some backstory to this guy always been
underweight growing up I've never been
like a normal way but near was my mom
it's just like I'm not I don't have any
disorder it's just like I have a high
metabolism you know and my body just is
always been smaller I'm like smaller
thin smaller bones whatever um so I used
to eat these before I would have to go
to Irish dance practice and I always
felt sick to my stomach after I ate it
because there's caffeine in these um and
it gave me way too much caffeine in my
body could not take it i also couldn't
drink into him I can't drink anything
from starbucks really or like McDonald's
frappes I can't drink those because I
get really nauseous if I drink too much
coffee can I had too much caffeine if
I'm drinking soda it's different i can
drink so for some reason because i
always eat it with food all right we
drink it with food and then the food
kind of like absorb some of the liquid
so it was fine but if i'm just drinking
a coffee drink or just eating this it's
like doesn't work out so I'm gonna try
these again I'm going to eat half at a
time to see if my body can like handle
it because I love these flavors they
look so good at everyone raves about
them so I'm like I want to try them
again but I've always had problems with
my stomach and these before so I'm just
gonna try them again so wish me luck
wish me luck
the last thing that I got a trader joe's
is why I want to try to doze and 00 drop
this glass container on baby oh it's
straight a joke speculoos cookie butter
speculoos speculoos I'm so excited to
try this I don't really know what I'm
gonna eat it with or eat it on I don't
eat it's just like pancakes and waffles
and I'm like I don't eat pancakes and
waffles so so we'll find something is it
pretzel so i can probably deploy
pretzels in it or something everyone has
cookie butter and it's not like peanut
butter it's a family amazing may have
crushed biscuits so I'm so freaking
excited to try this i'm so glad picked
it up it wasn't like four dollars so
it's the priciest thing that I guy but
I'm so excited because i have not been
able to try this i recommend going to
trader joe's um I'm not like a huge
organic kick yet I know a lot of people
were like okay I groovy and I go organic
i can't eat anything that's not okay and
I'm not like that night meet I'm not a
vegetarian sorry if that offends anyone

little snacks and little like healthy
junk foods if you know what I mean so
