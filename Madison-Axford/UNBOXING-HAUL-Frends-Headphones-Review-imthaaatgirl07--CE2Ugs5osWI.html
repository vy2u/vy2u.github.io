totally redone because I'm moving out to
college in two days and my sister's
taking over my room until they'd be
doing it so there's no carpet on the
floor there's no furniture through and
the acoustics of the other crazy so top
of it weird you know what anyway it's
day you can tell by the title I'm doing
in a boxing hall I kind of was a little
excited and just gonna review the
package that the actual package but like
the Amazon box I cut it open to make
sure there's enough
what do your help you know what
I'm saying but yeah I got it today in
some crime so I got it in one
dad you gonna be friends heads up that
almost everyone in the world has all
sudden the big studs in the gold and
white is there commentator do looked
into videos and let me show you a bag of
bones so as you can see I'm ready open
the Amazon box and inside is the friends
tailor box and taxes open me up
so you open up the box like so these
little flag flaps they're beautiful
headphones beautiful I know because I
had pair of beats for the credit or no
they were around $200 which is a lot for
headphones but pretty much the same
prices beats and I just thought that
these were a lot more cuter so I
a lot different kinds and colors that I
like to be building like the best
possibility I'm sure this is probably my
situated are my headphones but it beats
are a lot of them will happen those are
$200 to you so I don't think this is a
big deal so if we're gonna complete
about you spend on them don't bother
but tournament oh those two box okay so
we come up a little case is this it yeah
it's a really tiny case a bunch of wires
back today movies
obsessed where you trying to do this out
okay see these are the headphones
average but the keeps they're very like
turning easily there is a deterrent
attorney that looks like backward court
don't they it won't break I'm gonna go
get my phone so I can have a first
impression with these going on swing
music hugging this in just two volume to
substitute loud and I'm going to listen
to all about that bass
severities is that they're really great
they're amazing
sound - and the way the way your music -
this is awesome don't you care about
anything getting dirty they're white but
there's a fashion statement like they're
soaps
yeah I love that I'm really glad I spent
the money and bone then I thought about
for a while
