doing it updated with some my iPhone and
I'm doing my iPhone 5 because the last
ones were on my iPhone 4 and so I
thought I'd since I got an iPhone 5 I do
it what's on my iPhone 5 this is the
case that I have on it right now it's
from Charlotte Russe and it has these
like studs that are gold and pointy and
I just love them and it's a black case
it doesn't give much protection but it's
absolutely beautiful
and I'm racking up some iPhone 5 cases
so I can hopefully do an update with
iPhone case collection for my iPhone 5
soon but it only have like three so yeah
so anyway I've had my iPhone 5 for about
two months now and two let's get right
into the video my opening screen says
belong your dreams and I think it's so
cute because I blog my life and my
dreams I guess I thought it was kind of
cute and described me cuz it's a blogger
I don't know I just thought it's cute it
has a hint of pink in it which I love so
now I'm going to zoom you're closer and
we can get on with the rest of what's on
my iPhone so I do not have a passcode on
it right now because I just got annoying
after a while but I usually do so I am
luck and here's my main screen and they
only have two pages and I've gone
through these so many times to see what
I can delete because I hate having apps
that I don't use and I deleted so many
apps that I used to have but I've kept a
lot also so starting at the top we have
Safari Calendar camera and photos and I
don't have that many photos because
they're like - but I'm on my computer to
save them and then to leave them off my
phone to you know get more room and then
I have videos weather maps and reminders
and I've actually used maps a lot
recently then I have iTunes Store Notes
app store and settings I also use notes
a lot clock will chase for my alarm
every day I need an alarm to be set
otherwise I will not get up until well I
mean I will get up but seriously I like
to get up early so having an alarm
obviously helps me and that's what makes
me get up Twitter which I've been using
more Instagram which I've loved since
day one these are all my photo editing
apps we have near gram which I love if
you went like two of you in a picture
her and I have photo grid to make
collages text for likes which I like to
put hashtags
quickly on my Instagram photos so I have
that woulda gram or Y de grande which is
my
favorite which has the white bars around
your picture camera plus square ready
and Lumia and this is how I edit my
photos if you standing my photos on
Instagram or my favorite new app finds
I'll use mirror Graham will always win a
Graham Lumi a for lights and stuff
square ready if I want my um picture to
be like off-center and have white around
it camera plus for extra editing that is
around us an offer photo grid if I want
to make a collage and then text for
likes for likes on my Instagram pictures
the last row we have vine which I didn't
know my username forever so like I
couldn't tell anyone what um like how to
find me but I do know it now snapchat
and finds which finds is this great new
app that not a lot of people know about
I'm a VIP partner and I have a hundred
and twenty six followers which is
amazing and I have thirteen posts all
these Instagram pictures that I posted
and then I say where I got the things
that I'm wearing in them anyway I'm just
I'm that girl of seven all capital
letters and this is the greatest app for
the new fashion vines and new beauty
finds stuff like that so definitely
check it out it's just go to the App
Store type in fines fi nd s and then
lastly we have my most used apps down
here which are obviously messages mail
for my YouTube phone and then music next
page we have this thing that checks my
grades at school and not in score now so
I wouldn't delete that app but I want it
um obviously when school starts back up
in two weeks
Bank of America app from my banking
account and just keeping up to date on
what I bought and you know make sure
there's no fraud going on Facebook which
I only use to look at people's pictures
and post my own pictures I don't
actually you know like use it or post
statuses followers Plus which is a great
way a few like me and you want to know
who unfollow see you on Instagram I just
like knowing that Pandora which is great
to listen to new music and I found a lot
of my favorite artists off their
SoundHound which if a song is playing in
a store somewhere and you want to know
what song that is it works amazingly you
just hold it up to it and you push a
little button and then it finds the song
for you like automatically it's
incredible then I have this productivity
tab which is just all this random stuff
that I never use except calculator I
will use sometimes in contacts if I want
to put someone news contact in but I
never use that stuff in the newsstand
you can't delete it which makes me so
angry let me have tumblr Netflix cuz I
became more addicted to that and the
YouTube app sucks but it's easy
check you know views and messages that I
have on my channel or other videos that
I'm going to show people but otherwise
I'll just go to Safari and look up
YouTube but I just have that there to
make things run more quickly anyway I
hope you enjoyed this updated video
again I don't have that much on my phone
but you should definitely check out the
finds out this isn't a sponsored video
but seriously I'm a VIP partner and so
you can check my thing out and maybe
I'll follow you also umm maybe we should
snapchat sometime it is a big really fun
thank you for watching and check back
later for more videos bye like we always
do with this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
