what's on my iPhone tag because this was
requested and um even though my old one
is up and what's up when they asked for
the updated one um I guess was just kind
of outdated and I have lot of new things
a lot of old things less stuff that I'm
gonna show you what anyway um so yeah I
guess I'm just yeah you know get started
and I really want to do anyone any wage
because a lot of stuff has changed i
have a lot of new apps and I just kind
of want to show you guys stuff yeah what
so this my iphone it's kind of dirty but
it's the same iphone 4 white yes my home
screens obviously mami man Bob Marley
and just says everything is gonna be
alright maybe not today but eventually
excuse noise of you here in my house is
getting worked on so it's 359 you just
slide ooh in luck slide 21 there we go
okay so this is my oh my Gordon das so
this is my main screen and I don't
really pay a lot of tension to these
folders that I have like I don't really
categorize them you know mine fully I
should kind of put them in random little
boxes and kind of you know to go with it
I'm not like this is music this is games
this is but like no I just kind of do
whatever like this one's name like stuff
I think yeah wha okay anyway and my
background is off strawberry electrics
Instagram I know it's kind of creepy but
she had this beautiful picture of New
York that she took out of a plane window
I just loved it it was her background so
I was like I'll make it my background
too so we'll just go right ahead and
start at the top I use the first day of
Safari I used a lot and I just need it
right there then I have settings I
change like brightness a lot and it's
just nice to have it on the front page
camera don't really use it that much at
least I don't use that icon to if i'm
going to use camera i'll usually just
use this slide up bar where you like
okay I can do it there you go and so
it's just like oh oh oh what let's see
if we can do this like bald how can
no this isn't working so attractive okay
um but i'll just use that camera i won't
really click on the icon but in case in
case i do i'll have right there and then
we have photos I don't have that many
photos but um um but the photos I oh
okay oh I don't have that many photos
but um and the reason it ah um the
reason I don't have that many photos is
because I just don't like taking up all
that room I like to have a lot of space
for music and stuff like that rather
than like apps and pictures and stuff
like a lot okay then we have clock I use
it every morning I get up at five every
morning use my little alarm and I have
Instagram obviously I'm selfie an
Instagram not as huge as i used to be i
don't i don't use instagram as much
anymore but um I still do and ideally a
lot of my photos just cuz they're old
and I didn't like them but okay no but I
mean this is my profile I'm Madison
Avenue 96 so I haven't changed it enough
already I love changing stuff like that
but he's my pictures and I haven't post
a picture in a while I may I postman
yesterday but I hadn't posted a picture
in a while it's just I just don't find
time to do all these social networking
things anymore like I used to but it's
whatever and I have mail I've uses a lot
since i started my youtube channel um
because you know you get mail from
companies get mail from businesses or
subscribers or few words or messages
comments whatever and that's just nice
to have then we have a lifestyle with my
apps I love these using them constantly
