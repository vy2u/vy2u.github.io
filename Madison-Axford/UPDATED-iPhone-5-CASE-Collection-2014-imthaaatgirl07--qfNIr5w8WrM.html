these you know in my last iPhone case
collection video but I'm showing you
them all again because I got new ones as
well as the old ones okay anyway
hey I'm so today I'm doing my first
video ever standing up I don't know I
just thought it would be kind of cool
today I'm doing my iPhone 5 iPhone case
collection I'm doing an updated version
because I've got a lot since my last
iPhone case collection video but I'm
very excited to do this video because
you guys always request it and really
want to see it so I'll cut the talking
short to end without further ado let's
get into the video the first iPhone case
that I have is my new wildflower case I
love wildflower cases so so much because
they're amazing and they're handcrafted
with these jewels and this one is the
rainbow tie-dye one and it has the
golden jewels heart studded thing on the
back all these cases will be linked in
the downbar where you can find them or
where you can find similar ones because
I know a lot of you guys like these like
I do and you want to know where to find
them so they'll be like to the downbar
for you and if I can't find the exact
one I'm very very similar iPhone case to
mine so yeah this is the first one it
was around $40 before shipping and
handling on wildflower cases calm the
second iPhone case I have is just my
OtterBox 1xtra this one before it has
two parts the rubbery
part and then the hard outer case part
and it's just pink and from OtterBox and
every buck it was the first case I got
for my iPhone 5 cuz if you know me you
know that when I got my iPhone for the
second day I had it I dropped it fell
down a flight of stairs in Nashville and
it just shattered so I got this one when
I got my iPhone 5 to make sure that I
had a case unlike the first time I got
an iPhone so I just picked this up at
Walmart I think it was like 35 40 bucks
just like the other one if you want a
really good protective case there are
gonna be kind of more pricier then I
have my Lilly Pulitzer iPhone case look
at this it's so cute it has the flowers
I don't know the exact design right now
to top my head but I will have it linked
in the downbar I think again 30 40 bucks
like they are kind of pricey I really
like this one I haven't used it that
much that's like my wildflower cases but
I have it for when I do want to use it
next I have my infamous Olaf case if you
watched my Disney World a haul you know
that I got this when I went to Disney
World
earth Spring Break I love frozen and I
love Olaf he's like the greatest
character in the movie so I got this
case again 35 bucks I think but I really
really love this and
it's just so cute and it reminds me of
the movie and going to use in your role
then we have another kind of childish
one it's a little mermaid one but little
mermaids one of my favorite movies and
it has Arielle and flounder and
Sebastian on it and it's cute I just
reminds me of being young with and being
a child and my mom got me this so yeah
then I have my second one flower case
and this is the sunflower Cross but it's
a gold cross set it on the back and it's
a sunflower print yeah it's super cute I
used this one for like almost 6 months 7
months which is a really long time for
me in an iPhone case this is the
Aeropostale major book 1 it's a mirror
so you can see you know if you got
boogers in your nose or something in
your teeth but yeah it's just nice to
have a mirror on the back of your phone
you know as your case anyway moving on
to the next iPhone case it's a j.crew
leopard print case me and McKenzie and
my friend have the same case but yeah
it's just really simple I got it in the
jigsaws factory store the next case is
this rice Duggan rhinestone case I don't
know more I got this one from but I'll
find one on ebay similar to it the thing
I don't like about this is I got a
promise to store at the mall and it was
really cheap like 10 bucks or under and
that the rhinestones that are suppose to
be gold are kind of rubbing off and
turning like this rusty gold
looking gross color it's not really the
gold I wanted to look like like a wife
lower case and it's rubbing off so I'm
not gonna use this much at all anymore I
mean it was cute when I had in when it
was actually gold and not disgusting
looking in the last case I have for you
today for my iPhone 5 case collection is
my monogrammed otter box from
personalized from Mediacom I love this
case so so much it's brown and white
chevron with a like pink cranberry ish
color circle in the middle with my
monogram which is ma T last name in the
middle again it's two parts as a great
rubbery part and the hard part is beat
OtterBox personalized for mediacom has a
debauch cases and this was like $80 when
I bought it I'm pretty sure but they
have gone down and price since then
unless they've gone back up but they did
go down after I was like
hmm that's okay um you know I like it a
lot it does kind of the pain just
scratch off a little bit so know that
it's not the most durable case even
though it is an otterbox paint wise like
it will scratch off and kind of
disappointing but that's okay so anyway
I hope you enjoyed this standing up
video and my iPhone 5 updated iPhone
case collection it was very requested so
