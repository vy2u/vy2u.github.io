pineapple friend hey out so I know a lot
of you have been waiting for this
updated iphone case collection video
this is going to met you when in what's
yours 2013 edition and I do have an
iphone 5 less than I got which is my
most viewed video which is like thirty
one thousand plus views um crazy amazing
was my iphone 4 iphone case collection
so this one I don't have that many I
have been trying to save more money and
not splurging and buying so many cases
for my iphone 5 like i used to for my
iphone for everything that i saw i would
buy it from an f-14 if I just liked it a
little bit like there was some stupid
ones but I still bought them anyway this
this stem around I don't have as many I
have six um which is still a lot you
know compared to some people but for me
I'd like 18 billion in my other one and
i will have the links to where you can
get all of these or similar ones um like
on ebay or amazon or wherever in the
description box down below so check
those out if you want to get one like me
the first one is on my phone right now
I've had it on this is like the longest
case I've ever kept on my phone and I
absolutely love it it's incredible um
it's a wildflower case and it's their
sunflower one with the UM cross gold
stud thing in the middle there is a
really one simple reason why I love this
so much I just think it's the most
beautiful thing I've ever seen and I'm
definitely interested in getting another
my flower cases soon I've gone to the
website and picked up a few that I might
want to look at closer and buy another
one um they are $35 with five dollars
shipping but they do protect your phone
amazingly which I didn't know if they
would or not um but they def hello um
but they definitely do and there's like
this rim around it that's I don't know
it's just up a little bit so it does
protected your screen the only kind of
bad thing is well I always see it is bad
but other people said it was annoying
was when they put my phone down on the
surface it's not going to lay flat
because the jewels do or the studs do
stick out a little bit I couldn't give a
crap about that but I don't know my
friends when they on my like pick it up
to me oh it doesn't lay flat who cares I
love this it's amazing and provides
great protection so like fashionable and
stylish so I think I'm going to get the
Rose eating in yang one next but it's
all out or something anyway I have this
sunflower one for now and I absolutely
love it and I had it on here for like
months like literally months and ever
since I posted that picture and
Instagram I've kept it on there and
that's incredible and my other cases
aren't getting this much loved sorry the
second case that i have is an otterbox
this is the first time i got i feel like
it's the first one I always get when i
first get a new iphone and this one is
the pink one for the iphone 5 obviously
and it has two parts the other one i
think i had the head three and then a
yellow one was just one but anyway if
you haven't seen that video i'll put it
in the down bar as well but this is just
a white flimsy rubber thing that you put
on first and then this hard outer case
that gives you the most protection
slides right on over top that white part
next and there you have a two-part
otterbox case otterbox is obviously
protect it more than any other case you
know they're great they are I think 30
bucks or 40 bucks 30 I think it was
cheaper than this one but I do like this
one more because it's beautiful um this
one's great though it's pink and white
which is super cute I just haven't used
it since I first got it cuz when I first
got my phone this is the first thing I
put on it and now I have other ones to
put on it so this is kind of been put on
the back burner sorry otterbox then I
have a super duper cute Lilly Pulitzer
own case and I don't know the print of
this my bed I think this is another 30
35 dollar one but it's super cute it's
like blue on the inside and then it has
this adorable just like rose flower
floral print on the outside and its
really cute it was kind of a splurge
item when I went to a lilly pulitzer via
shop and i really really really really
really love it on my head on there for
like a few weeks and then that's when I
got this one right after it so I didn't
just have as much time with this one I'm
like acting like the person or something
but I really love this one I'm glad I
have a lily puts her case for my iphone
5 then i have the infamous victoria's
secret pink behind apple case i saw
macbarbie 07 had this and um it's not
like the reason i had to get it but she
did i did see it with like she had it i
did see it when she had it so i was like
oh that's really cute i should get that
so i think it was 30 bucks water with no
25 2495 a thing but i don't know if this
is still available cuz it was like a
summary pineapple sunglass case it's
probably on ebay though you can
definitely find it it has this huge
pineapple like stem thing that sticks
out it's super cute and
like taking a selfie it's like you have
a little friend pineapple friend it's so
cute ah pineapple friend next is my
first I case that i got from what seal i
think in my other video what's on my
iphone i said i got it from charlotte
russe but i was totally a brain fart and
i got from wet seal anyway it's really
cute it there's a heron that's not cute
but it's just black and it doesn't
provide greater protection for the
screen but it has tons of gold studs
like completely and entirely have a
cover the back and I don't know why I
said I got this from shell true so if
you saw me what's on my iphone 5 video
I'm sorry that's not where i got it i
should have changed that but i honestly
even want to edit it do and realize that
until i rewatched it like 10 beers later
and realize that this is from wet seal
so anyway I'm sure you can buy this
anywhere and you can definitely find a
lot of these on ebay there'll be one
linked below like all the others and
finally I got a free case from air
pistol and if you tried on a pair of
jeans um you didn't have to buy them but
if you try to have pair of jeans you got
a free case and I did end up buying them
they're like blue jeans in front and
black jeans in the back which is really
cool it's like color-block jeans um but
I was just gonna get that case for free
i thought i'd buy them and i love the
jeans anyway and this one says it's a
mere actually it's really quote samir
case see if you can see that I consumer
camera and it says made you look with a
little kissy face which I think's
adorable it's like me to look so yes
again this is from aeropostale and I
really really really love this case it's
such a great like invention cuz you're
like I me and me I need see if I have a
booger or something in my teeth and then
you're just like buh-bye oh I look good
what I do every day I like the new me
your son he's always rolling the makeup
for my hair but anyway this just me so I
don't know if you can don't necessarily
find this one it might be on ebay but
I'm sure there's tons of cases with
mirrors like as the case the back or
whatever anyway that was kind of short
but that was my iphone case collection
for my iphone 5 i hope you enjoyed it i
really am spending you know I spent a
lot on the cases but it's like I don't
have as many as last time and I'm i love
all the ones that i have and i don't
feel like i wasted money on any of them
especially the free one anyway oh yeah
and this one was like 10 but anyway
