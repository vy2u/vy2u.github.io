haven't done one of these in quite a
while on my channel so I'm very excited
to be able to do one for you today I
left a Instagram picture asking you guys
to ask me questions I must always do my
Q&amp;amp;A on Instagram but follow me on there
medicine experts same on Twitter so you
can see what I'm doing in my life and
also you're able to see what I'm doing
Q&amp;amp;A so you can ask questions so players
can get answered but today I would
answer however many I guess I see that I
haven't really answered before and you
know further ado let's get started
yes how many times have you been to the
ER okay see one of Mohini and then I
think maybe three other times think
three other times I broke a lot of toes
went to the Arvada Irish dance that I
wrote my wrist
well I broke my wrist before mitosis but
then I went to here for that I wrote
with my other wrist and my knees but I
went to Urgent Care for that not ER and
then I think when I had pneumonia when I
was young I went to the ER and then my
finger so four or five three three to
five will go three to five updates on
rice gum now it wasn't ever going to
talk about risk on my channel again
because I didn't ever want him or anyone
else to think that I was using his name
for views if my sole purpose was jeez
people's name perfused I would be doing
every large youtuber you know including
PewDiePie like Shane Dawson like anyone
so I'll let Beth know more like anyone
that had a big following I would be
doing videos about that reaction to them
that is not why I reacted to him or made
a second video about him I think that's
disgusting that anyone would think that
actually but um I rented rights come
because every common after I posted my
first few activities we're back to rice
gums because mr. Staub recipes give him
a step right a little if person was
about rice gum and I did his first to do
it cuz us rekted so much and I thought
it was funny I thought it was cute or I
think he is like I do really like him I
think he's a genuine person he's just a
class act and I do honestly think he's
very talented
are we dating no we have talked like we
have danced but I don't need you guys to
go you know leave comments or anything
on his videos or his Instagram pictures
you don't even comment rice on every
picture I person Instagram
thank you for your support and for your
like hashtag shipping but like we don't
need it we're not a couple
I just really wanted you guys to know
what's happening everyone keeps tweeting
me and DMing me and facebooking me like
the little space
who uses that anymore I don't know I got
two emails even asking me about what is
happening thrice scum like you can't Lee
was hanging and I'm like now it's
like me reacting name rating to me great
from him me acted you know it so
whatever but we talked like slightly
about the whole situation or I try to
bring it up just so he knows why I did
it and like where I stood but um with
the whole situation but yeah Grandpere
think this will try to him I'm sure you
Rea know who he is here on this channel
but um yeah that's like say about that
how did you get your hot fins you
literally slight anything called Senseo
oh that's so sweet
Wow um my biggest thing that I always
say is fake it til you make it
because you're not just coming up with
name you like and perfect basically
everything and I don't think I slay
everything but that's just that's like
such a compliment thank you you're not
going to wake up one day and
automatically be the best person
prettiest person sick most successful
person in the world no you really have
to work hard and fake it today make it
so
in high school I would be made fun of a
lot I would be the you know bullied and
stuff I would have a sick of it I was
sick of being treated badly for being
different I dressed everything I
actively I talked differently I of
hobbies that are different than like
sports you know like I need YouTube
that's weird it's the most people so um
I just owned it I knew this is who I was
and who I wanted to be and I just
realized that whatever people say about
me doesn't really matter and it's you
know that's so cliche and it's so hard
to actually live that way but I honestly
was just like I really I really don't
give a about what these people
think about me and my comment is really
gain my senior high school I think is
we're all grasping we're all going
separate ways and I was just like like f
you look if you don't like me I don't
give a crap I'm gonna walk down the hall
my feels I'm gonna walk proudly and know
that what I'm doing is right I'm morally
correct I'm happy and I'm fierce within
myself and I love myself for Who I am
and no matter what you think about me it
may get to me after a while and they
think about it it doesn't actually
affect who I am as a person I might be
sad like um they said thing about my
clothes but then I'm like wait I chose
wear these clothes so I must like them
feel competent I'm there for I love what
I'm doing so if you believe in yourself
and you fake the confidence it will
eventually become confidence you got to
fake it and then it eventually will come
really yeah well you have any tattoos
no I don't everyone thinks that I do
when I draw on myself I draw myself for
possible tattoo ideas and I haven't
today's and I'm like nothing was I doing
with that I like tattoos a lot I like
them on other people I just cannot
commit to anything like I can't commit
to a guy don't commit to a tattoo that's
what I always say okay I wouldn't love a
tantric that lasted for like five years
or less like that would be incredible
and then just go away but the thought of
having for my tire life is like well I
wanted to have this written on my body
or drawn on my body or designed on my
body like for the rest of my life I
don't know if I like anything that much
I've gone back informa jr. I almost got
like 20 times I got almost will have my
mom signed a waiver in that she was like
maybe not and then my freshman year at
college I was walking to the tattoo
parlor in the tattoo for and then backed
out I thought I wanted it and I was like
maybe not and so I just keep going back
and forth and I feel like you're you're
hesitant or confused it all the ways you
get or why you should get it or if you
really want it you should not get it as
a now I don't and I don't plan on
getting it in the next few years um that
I'm aware oh what are some of your
favorite childhood TV shows I love that
show many holy crap um think of the
couch just comes to mind like holy

vanilla creme
I love like all the people in that
season laganja like they're they're all
so good
so um definitely season six because
beyond this material world I've seen
that he's got about 21 fangirl alert I
love it I love all the seasons I'm not
each kind of one though because you know
you can even watch out the episodes
they're like copy written taken down my
old ratchet this this quality of show
bad and I'm not really a fan of anyone
from that see singer besides me flowers
Tammy Brown so that seasons to like amp
but two three four five six seven eight
all stars all stress was also a little
like what what would the challenges but
yes love the question scene six for sure
okay when does Jeff get back it's funny
because Tim I'm filming this actually in
the day then he left one year ago
exactly one year ago I worked the day
like it was yesterday
oh my god it was hard for me I mean yeah
he didn't die he's just going on like to
your mission but think about like your
best friend the entire world it was
before I start started college in my new
college and met new people but it was
like he was like well I had I felt like
and now he's just gone for two years
like mineral communication can't see him
can hear his voice like gone and that
was so hard for me cousin never really
had to say goodbye to anyone except for
my papa before my life I'm very lucky
we've been through a ton of
this year holy crap like just everything
is just really really rocky um this past
year but we made out stronger and we're
doing great but he comes back in here so
it comes back August 8th I think it is
today's the 9th but comes back one day
early I think and I'm excited to see him
like he doesn't live in st. Louis
anymore but when he comes back but I'm
so super excited to see him and yeah
what's the favorite Disney park Epcot
why did the did I just take me ten
hours to think of girl I like don't even
really like the other ones to be honest
medic and I'm so packed with so many
kids but I do like the rise I don't like
Animal Kingdom like I literally never go
there sorry and I not a huge fan of
Hollywood serious at all cuz I don't do
anything I don't do anything they're all
I like is that cut because the countries
are so cool and the rides are great and
I love that part from different foods
and I love at cops so much are you
single this is a
question that's always always ask and I
think you're wondering but like people
always want to know you know what my
relationship is I'm not in a serious
relationship right now
am i single yes technically but I
wouldn't say I'm looking because of the
situation I'm in like I'm not I'm not
looking I'm good right now how many
times should you go on a date before
you're considered boyfriend/girlfriend
okay this is a great question because my
first like ex-boyfriend person never
asks me of a girl friend but told
everyone that I was his girlfriend I was
like the my your girlfriend what
could you like tell me before you tell
all your friends thank you so my
personal belief is that the guy says do
you want to be my like Joanna be my
girlfriend like they say I want to be
exclusive then it's like yes I am with
you like that is it we have
boyfriend/girlfriend let's do this
Facebook official but like you have to
let me know yet to notify me you have to
acknowledge the fact that we're together
otherwise I don't know if you have other
girls I'm not just not turn to the girls
like in other girls its effects okay
those instant thoughts are there if
you're looking at pics I'm gonna be like
hey with once the guy asks you where you
ask him we're like yeah there you go
exclusive boyfriend-girlfriend no more
questions no more concern no more
confusion you said it you talked about
it you're labeled what is your favorite
pickup line then after I just said that
I'm like we I don't any pickup lines
um I don't use pickup lines and I don't
suggest guys use them because they
wouldn't ward let's see what would I say
though if I was at a bar
oh I know I know that I'm late and it's
yours and then you'd be like who are you
and like be freaked out and I'd be like
you don't remember me you believe I
thank oh yeah that's an idea I mean if
you're not reaching on to subscribe my
channel my press coverage even like me
in the rest of stage but therefore the
video is supposed to be is every week
thanks for watching bye
