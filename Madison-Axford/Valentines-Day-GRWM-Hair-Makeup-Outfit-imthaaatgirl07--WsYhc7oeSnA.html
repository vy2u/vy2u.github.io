ow
show me what you got cuz I don't wanna
Oh
hey guys so now I'm gonna move on to my
hair look for this makeup hair outfit
Valentine's Day tutorial and I'm using
my new me
three-in-one set is the titan set it's a
hot pink it's a professional curling
iron oh my god and there's three
different barrels so if you want small
medium or large curls you can pick which
one you want since I do have shorter
hair I'm using this small neck very well
today
but anyway I love new me and before I
even started talking about how we're
coming here I mean you can see what I'm
doing um how I dimension what I've been
using in my hair for product wise um
people always ask me how my hair is
shiny it doesn't look that shiny in this
video because the lighting was hella bad
but um I only use one product on my hair
besides like shampoo and conditioner and
that is the new me white truffle hair
treatment masque it does everything I
needed to repairs strengthens and
protects my hair you know from heat any
products I use any styling products I
use and just you know overall damage
throughout each day it really helps my
hair get shiny and like to its original
amazing hair again that didn't make
sense at all but you know it just makes
me really shiny and I love it so that's
the only product I use in my hair but
anyway I love this color and so much
it's ridiculous oh no joke when I curl
my hair with this wand
I literally don't have to curl it again
for like three days I mean I do because
my hair is naturally really kind of oily
not greasy necessarily but it does have
a lot of oils as well showing the roots
because I always brush my hair so much
so I have to shower every day otherwise
just it annoys me but you can literally
go three days without redoing these
curls or just a touch up here and there
it's amazing to us forever
this color is literally the greatest
thing I have ever owned ever in life but
I'm not even just saying that I don't
even use hair spray with this look I've
never used to spread my curls and you
can see in my pictures on my videos I
don't meet you it literally stays I
don't know how my friends don't know how
my mom doesn't know how but this thing
states it's better than any curling iron
I've ever ever had before and if you get
this literally you'll never have to buy
another one because besides the fact
that there's three barrels it lasts
forever and it just works then quickly I
love it
I love you all so much and I wouldn't
recommend a products that I didn't love
so I do have some discount codes for you
