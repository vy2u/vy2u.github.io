the day of Christmas like I did that
once I think and I refused you to do it
ever again because I feel like it just
takes away from time with your family
and just Christmas because we we don't
know what Christmas is about and I feel
like running to do a YouTube video isn't
my style per se and I don't I don't know
I don't watch fit the videos on
