current beauty favorites for winter 2016
I am really excited to do these videos I
haven't done a favorites video and what
seems like forever I'm trying to do them
again I usually do and when I have
products I want to talk about cuz I
don't just want to like pick a bunch of
random things just been doing a
favorites video I really only want to do
a favorites video when I have things
that I'm truly passionate about and want
to share with you so that's what today
is um these are all related to beauty
and skincare so let's just hop right in
i'm so excited the first thing is my for
you this is my Luna to buy fur rail this
is just like a face brush washer light
from clarisonic or LA or like all the
different brands except it's amazing oh
my god i'm obsessed ok so what you do
just plug this in and then you can plug
this into your iphone charger or
anything like any charging outlet you
think you have just put into the wall
and then this touches up you can use it
for like twenty thousand times before
you charge it again which is incredible
you can even tell it that i use this
that's one thing I loved about this I
don't lay brush run almost clarisonic
you can tell that you used it they get
dirty no matter how much you clean it or
much so be put on it it never really
gets the bristles clean because they're
like a fabricated bristle where this is
just strictly silicone bubbles they
never ever get dirty that can be cleaned
it's a vibrating kind of thing and it
kind of vibrates your makeup off and it
penetrates the skin in a way that's not
forceful or hard so like a clarisonic
that's very firm and I talked about this
in when I got this in my skincare haul
video which I'll link in the downbar but
the clarisonic my mom has but it just
penetrates amazing so hard that it felt
achy and burning afterwards and I
couldn't use it for like another two
three days because um insane my away one
because it hurts so much where this is
so smooth and soft and physical pillow I
adored this and it has helped my
skincare 22 pitch I don't I don't know I
just I feel like it's because I'm taking
skate co more seriously it's not just
like oh yeah this is a miracle worker
this is great but I'm taking my skincare
more seriously again I like my skincare
haul down below so you can watch all the
products they got an amusing and they
come down below if you want to see a
skincare routine because I'd love to do
it for you and show you how to use this
but there's different speeds and there's
just like there's different skin type
ones those different one for combination
white Lance's doing all this stuff I
have the combination one which is the
blue one I I just love this products
it's so individualized and specialized
to each individual consumer of the
product so I'd like this definitely
check out Luna to buy frail linked in
the downbar i'm so so glad i got this
because i was debating woman I wanted to
get a clarisonic like my mom for this I
had the old lay one didn't really like
the bristles were too hard I'm really
glad that I went with this one because
it creates my skin so well and the next
product i'm talking about is my Kat Von
D shade and light palette as well as
this sheet in like rush I am Bacchus I
splurge I knew I wanted this cuz every
percentage you had to except for me and
I was like I just really really want it
looks amazing and incredible Kat Von D's
cosmetic lines one of my favorites
because she stepped up her game
impeccably like I loved her since her
first tattoo concealer came out and now
I'm like girl your liquid lip stains
this come to a pellet oh my god it's
amazing our eyeliner like I have
everything I love it um I use this shade
right here which is a perfect chocolaty
warranty shade with yellow undertones as
well as this for my under-eye this
league light peachy pink under I was
really max someone used to spending on
color so badly and the first time I used
it it just kind of was obvious i was
wearing under a highlight you could tell
that like oh she uses concealer so I was
like
so I really bought it for the purpose of
this one and this one but it's fine I
can use it on other people on clients
and stuff like that this one it's kind
of almost like a light light bronzer it
is very salmon II which you can use for
a blush but I don't know if I needs it
personally for an under eye this is very
very great challenge I'll often use this
like up on my temples in my hairline as
like a nice contour on my double chin to
contour away that or under my lower lip
for the shadow effect of a larger fuller
bottom lip but I won't use this as my
main sheet contour because it's not dark
enough for my liking this one's perfect
is a nice chocolate colored stones to
too dark for just using it on its own
but sometimes if this isn't picking up
enough or not as deep as a contour and
sharp as I want to create the illusion
of my cheekbone then I usually go in
with a little bit of this but I like
just tap it have it all four days to get
all that excess really dark brown off of
my brush and zone about this yes these
two together we're over one hundred
dollars but I had to get the brush and I
use this every single day since i bought
it it's the perfect resented brush
everyone owns it and I just come to peer
pressure I guess no but you know what I
mean like I couldn't not get these
they're best friends they had to go
together this is the perfect under I
fitter like those right under your eye
on sets it perfectly I use this around
my nose i usually use this just for
everything pop powder related and my
baking and then this is the perfect
angular convert brush obsessed obsessed
let me go to the shade so this is
levitation I point2 with this levitation
lyric lucid subconscious shadow play and
song somber whatever so yes I have been
obsessed with this and using it everyday
next I have my makeup geek Z palette i
have also i have my mac shows and
different one my abh a dozen different
lengths and in my makeup geek all
together i like to get organized and not
smash them all together with all the
different brands but the reason i'm
joined me this is because I two favorite
colors um to the past I don't know since
I got this like maybe four months ago
that I've adored this one I use every
day it is my absolute favorite makeup
geek eyeshadow of all time it's creme
brulee I use it in every single a shell
like I've ever done since I started
taking makeup seriously and I endure it
if you can get one shadow get creme
brulee it goes with anything you can use
it as a transition
shadow is a lid shadow as a crease color
you can build it up you can work it down
like anything can be done with creme
brulee it's six dollars guys six dollars
that's it anyway my second favorite is
this one which is daydreamer and it's a
nice purple store glad on my lids right
now when I do my halo makeup look you'll
see in a few days is going to come up on
my channel but the thing about the
purple is I was always here to do it but
this one I think it's ten dollars for
their oil shadows but I just got it I
think when it was on sale I'm sorry I
don't think it is until anymore but when
I got it it was six dollars and I just
picked up on a whim and honestly it's
been my favorite child to work with I
work all the time I work purpose more
than I wear neutrals anymore because I
love the purple plum shades and that
goes perfectly for any glory I look that
I'm doing I love the purple daydreamer
shadow so those are my two favorite
makeup each shadows I love them next
eggs staples for my face my Revlon
Photoready insta-fix foundation stick in
the shade 130 shell as well as my
Maybelline master concealed concealer in
the shade 20 light these two are like
always shades that are sold out I don't
know if everyone has my skin tone or
what but every one every store has you
sold out don't want to placing it up and
I found our Walmart they successfully
always restock their cosmetic shelves
Thank You walmart target I'll just know
never restocks them but I'm like
thinking well my friend coming through i
recently switched no not recently like
two months ago switched from liquid
foundation and powder foundation to a
foundation stick yes I make a forever HD
foundation stick I do not like it I
would much rather use this Revlon
insta-fix honestly because it's just so
much cheaper and the product is
basically the same like I it's a little
better actually than make up for ever HD
not hating but look at my goblins so
it's the perfect color actually got the
right skin tone color for the most part
this time there's no shade finishing
that I should be perfectly or really
anyone because there's so much
discoloration my skin so I can't get a
perfect like skin tone red purple home
foundation because my skin is red and
purple undertone I can't find that not a
one
I want to find one that'll match my neck
for the most part that's what this is I
had my mom match it so we're good we're
good she to go but the thing about this
is it is a clay waxy base it's not a
liquid foundation it's not running all
over your face is not a powder because
it is full coverage it's full coverage
foundation stick oh my godness you can't
say enough about this it doesn't oxidize
because when air hits it it's a clay
base so it's not luck today as a liquid
and turning orange or getting air
bubbles within it and I just love this
it doesn't move unless you move it so it
will not smudge when I get greasy for
the most part unless you like that's why
when you put it on you got to use a
Beauty Blender sponge a brush a
foundation brush flat top kabuki
whatever to buff it into your skin
because it will not move because it's a
waxy like base I adore this oh my god
the greatest prop ever for face no
concealer can't compare to this this is
master can feel like Maybelline I hope
they don't stop ever selling this insane
without foundation stick because this
covers my under eyes like no other is
just cut it's kind of like um if you
know Amazonian clay foundation my tart
like the foundation that's what this is
it's so thinking it feels like what you
can't see when I'm wearing it because
it's blends right in so seamlessly and
seamlessly and fits into whatever
foundation shade you're wearing it
doesn't like stick on the top of your
skin like naked by urban decay prime of
concealer does I don't like that one
this oh my god it's unlike anything I've
ever tried before concealer wise and i
just am in love with it because it does
wonders for my skin my blemishes my
everything and sometimes this one cover
everything that's where this little if
little best friend comes in handy these
are my face products pierre everyone i
want to have in my face for the past 90
s your future with the past nine months
the past three months this is what my
goat-cheese arm and my last beauty
product that's a favorite for which is
in 16 is a new one for me but it's all
day in the store boy I'll telescopic
mascara I feel like everyone in their
mother has this mascara and I never
tried it because it's like
and Buck sounds like I have better than
sex I have you know my mail a mess guys
the lala and I'd never tried this I
tried to try it once but I actually got
the balloonist lash line it's like the
million lash whatever gold tube and I
thought it was this one but it wasn't
and I'm not just okay but this is the
tiniest tiniest brush of life yet it
gives my bottom and top lashes so much
volume like it's incredible it's just
like better than sex with separating
except it doesn't get clumps because it
is such a thin tiny brush but in the sex
is amazing for clumpy spider lashes
which I love most of the time but I'm
really into falsies right now so I'll
just put a little of this on my top
lashes before I apply my falsies and
then this separates the bottom lashes
like no other and mix them not clumpy
but stand up so voluminous Lee that's
not even aware but I'm gonna pretend is
I love this mascara and it's been out
four hundred thousand years I don't know
haven't tried it before now but that is
my card beauty favorites for 12 2016 I
