is seemingly deceased within the YouTube
community a what's in my purse who is
heard of that since 2012 I don't know
but I've been doing them like every year
since I love them they're like my some
of my favorite videos to watch still
especially from Charles gross
I love him his what's in my dump bag is
what I'm doing today a replication of in
a way because this is in fact my dump
bag what does the dump that you ask my
definition of it is the bag that I don't
change the entire year so like I've used
this for about six seven months now but
I've used little bags on the side yet in
the end everything that I really use and
own comes back to this bag so throughout
the year I'll throw a little things I
should probably either be thrown away or
put away in this but I'll take turns
with other little bags that I like to
take out with me see I put my phone in
my cards and my keys and like one little
bag but I pull them from this and then
dump them back into here once I'm done
with that
so throughout the year this has
collected a bunch of stuff I haven't
cleaned this up once but it is my black
Valentino large tote but this was not
added I didn't add anything this is true
what I have in my purse this is a
designer like expensive bag so I need to
better care of it that I haven't passed
six months this is my way of also
cleaning it I was just gonna clean it
but I was like that might be a fun video
to do some stone dozens anymore hope you
enjoy it oh yeah we have further ado
let's get started what's in my dumped
bag year-end review first thing is a
dollar bill next I have a Panera receipt
that he thrown away for a cup of soup I
used to work there this was the first
time I've been back into my Panera Bread
Co workplace in like two years so that
was weird um I got some forget stuff the
other day well two packs of gum that was
on sale because I love gum I go through
it like almost a pack a day so any gum
that's on sale bye bye I didn't know if
I'd like it should've got more than
cheeks of 68 cents I guess these are
like winter flavors trident my favorite
is 5 them I think I have some in here
yeah here's some wrapper the five cobalt
one's my favorite
but yeah on sale gum so imma try these
hopefully I like them anyway I'll put my
trash I guess in this target bag works
perfectly okay next I have my Chanel
sunglasses which are my hair sunglasses
they're the most obnoxious once I own
but like bought these this summer
they're the shield runways they're
purple and they say Chanel only on the
front of them but I just wanted this big
case and carry them around always you
don't wear the one any makeup on though
because it messes up my nose contour I'm
a few more singles out single dollar
bills and I never have cash ever I never
have dollar goals so that's great for
like then machines or tips wherever I go
um I have another receipt target is this
the gum receipt yeah that's just fell
out I ever see to a tavern that I went
to and it's funny I went to a bar and I
got a Coke and mozzarella sticks so more
gum wrappers I have this gum that's
almost gone it's just Orbitz spearmint I
have the body no yeah buddy-buddy and
hand lotion
yeah body moisturizer from the bike shop
I got for Christmas from my mom I this
AFER's a little travel when I met Elise
needs at hand stuff because my hands are
so dry I've already used a lot of it so
I should keep that in my bag so I can
have it when I'm out and about in the
cold I have my wallet with actual trash
in it this is a Kate Spade wallet and
hot pink I like it I wouldn't choose his
color again because I don't like pink
that much um it's just not a hair color
but in it I have a bunch of gift cards
like here let's see in the back here I
have tickets to like games that I went
to and like musical shows and then I
have an Amazon gift card I have so many
gifts part it's like forever 21 which
which a frozen yogurt place Barnes &amp;amp;
Noble back Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond bread Co a
movie theater Red Robin who is that cute
oba Starbucks which I don't drink that
much a receipt from Saks for my Chanel
necklace I think um Ulta gift card oh my
god a gasps Hardee's that I hate in a
library card and then I have my middle
compartment that I use for change but it
all fell out in the bottom of my
Valentino Scientifics that today um
during this video I have my checkbook
next I know that venmo is a thing now I
use that among college people but with
my mom a lot I borrow money or something
I'll just write her and check on another
receipt for another bar in the dr.
pepper this time hmm
so trash I have gum that is trident
cinnamon I always have problems I'm
telling you I have a a receipt for oh I
made a deposit to my Roth IRA my
retirement fund
what am i 40 no I don't know um this
little buddy that I love a wet brush but
it's a small mini version and I could
take this with me every time I go out
let you into a bar like this is in my
little itty bitty bitsy crossbody bag
because I hate my hair gets tangled I
usually always have it straight which
also means that I bring along who might
lay right everywhere that I go with me
these two things need them but later
right is a call made based kind of gel
like hair product that I just put on the
top of my head when I have my hair pin
straight because I hate flyaways I hate
sideways so I just kind of put it
lightly right here and it's a life
changer um I have a DS game because I
was obsessed with yes like during the
month of October I was like obsessive
penny mario kart so i have that of IDS's
like put away now but i saw this game up
by my phone that was at the bottom I
have my little wallet which is also a
Kate Spade but it says copy pink but I
appreciate a lot more this big black
puff box makes it easy to find because I
have my everyday things in here like I
have whoopsie like my Sephora beauty
card my debit card my license student
ids stuff like that right here that's
just easy to grab in case I'm like out
and about and I don't want my whole
wallet and then inside I have this is so
special because it is a $100 bill that
my dad gave me my very first day of
freshman here at college at Mizzou and I
never spent it and I never will he said
in case I ever got into jail this was my
bail money and it's ripped to shreds
probably won't even take it anymore
maybe they will I don't know if Rick
because I'm gonna frame this because it
shows that I made it through college
next I have a really old condom that's
not safe to use because it's like
I have a shitty pair of headphones that
are yellow everyone makes fun of me
because everything I'm mine is very
clean and like I'm very hygienic but for
some reason my headphones look like they
fell in a sewer and then we're eaten and
thrown up and they're supposed to be
white right like Apple iPhones but
they're like grungy brought any throwing
wakes once I doesn't even work so yeah
that's going in the trash I have a
