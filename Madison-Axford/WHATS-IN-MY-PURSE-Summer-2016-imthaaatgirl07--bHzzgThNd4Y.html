errands and I was like you know what I'm
done in a little bit a what's in my
purse I've done what's my backpack I
think over winter break but I haven't
done what's my person so long I'm really
fun I love watching these videos they're
like old I know they're not like a huge
thing on YouTube anymore but I wish they
were I wish more people do them because
you know we're all nosy about it so I
thought I'm doing for you today because
as I said I was running errands I like I
like my purse was so messy I couldn't
find anything I was like this is the
perfect condition to do a what's my
purse because I honestly I know we were
like I haven't looked through this but I
really haven't like I really have not
looked through this I don't know what
we're gonna find but it should be a good
a good video because I haven't cleaned
it out in a while and yeah so I'm using
Spurs for a while I've had forever it's
a little it's ratchet I know but
whatever so it's my Steve Madden I don't
know what it's called
whatever has two buckles on the front
and it's this nude color and then on the
back it's like the ugliest colors
combined but I loved it at the same time
so you got green Brown mood and like up
so I bought this a while back and yeah
it has over the shoulder crossed money
whatever strap but yes I don't know what
it's all in here I'm a little worried
but at the same time I don't care I've
shown you oh dear I'm sure new has
plenty of stuff before it so here is an
overview and then let's hop right in
first thing I have her here is we're
going I gotta get away is we Milk Duds
and M&amp;amp;Ms use my two favorite candies and
so I guess I always just carry them on
hand
no I recently purchased both of these
books art and in mine inserts into them
oh my god it's meant to be if you didn't
know about me I am missing one of my
teeth that sounds weird but one of my
adult teeth I saw the baby tooth because
I don't have an adult tooth underneath
so if it does fall out I'll have to get
a implant jeff has the same missing one
it's like a cool little friendship thing
we both have a missing tooth but yeah so
I think air for what I mean let that
it'll pull it right out of there if I
don't watch out next thing I have are
these mini Forks a lot of them have
fallen out unfortunately at the bottom
my purse I'll have to throw this weight
but these are for forever out on the go
or whatever you need a fork and you
don't have one or the restaurant doesn't
have one or whatever the problem may be
then you can have your own little mini
Forks in your purse and so I got these
on my clothes as a kind of a joke
because I was like these are actually
very smart to carry around so I do have
this
and yeah you're gonna see 94 it's now at
the moment hers that fell out oh great I
have an Ulta coupon that I already used
so I don't know why I still have it then
I have extra watermelon gum you saw this
in my 99-cent video with my sister and I
still have it I can't eat watermelon
normally but I really like this gum so
it's this extra sweet watermelon flavor
it's very very sweet and juicy so yeah
it's literally only food then I have
these to go Clorox wipes they're on
clearance so I picked them up I don't
I'm not that afraid of germs like I
don't I've never used these yeah so
there's just in case I guess in case
some like really gross thing comes about
because I've never looked clean to hand
over a door or a table or a desk or a
chair or anything so I don't really know
what the point of these was but I catch
my like spilling on my computer's like I
just wipe it up so I carry those around
with me and then I have a pair of apple
headphones like the old kind these was
just my goat cheese they're comfy in my
ears these kind and Newbill I was like
why am i trying on titles right now you
know anyway there are the only ones I
have that aren't broken currently so so
he's great I break everything here comes
the forks that I cannot throw away
because I wasn't careful nails built
then I have my key chain thing I have my
car key my apartment key this little
blue thing holds my like student ID some
cash my debit card some credit cards and
rewards cards I have pepper spray right
here but this one this is me alone again
anyone because it always open so I'll be
walking around and it's open to I need
to always be truth close and get a new
one but yeah and then I have this little
I heart New York bear Oh leaflets our
key fob and then this anti-sexual
harassment violence ribbon oh yeah
that's my keychain
then come on guys what would it be
without a Madison person without a barf
bag here we are ready we are ready in
case it attacks and this doesn't take up
much room and you know it just falls to
the bottom and I don't know everything's
crazy but then it's like a really smart
adieu at the same time if you get sicker
I gotta throw up in your car or you can
throw up in the bag the bag that I had
my larger I'm Kate's baby pink wallet
this just holds me
all my gift cards and some cash
let me give cards rewards cards
membership things and then cash and some
change
that's all in here this is just the
bigger thing so if I'm running really
quickly I'll just take my blue wallet
but then this is always stays in my
purse for gift cards and stuff yeah I
have a receipt for the post office if
tissues I only have two shoes because if
I get a nosebleed which is a very very
common occurrence for me so this is just
in case
I'm very just in case in my oh my gosh
guys guys a razor so cool
hello its me I was wondering if after
all these use your legs me girl okay
this is my mom's old phone and I was
like I found it in a cabinet and I was
like I want to pretend like I saw a
razor this is just me being like crazy
because I do have my where's my pony I
have my phone right here in my bag a
normal iPhone but like we took a razors
for granted these are cool as like
I would love to so carry this around
this is amazing to me I know you have to
type like nine buttons just to say hey
but like at the same time this is so
cool and then when you're pissed you can
be like as if it's a roll boy I love it
anyway then I have my normal iPhone 6s
white and silver whatever I have my
sunglasses which I always buy cheap
sunglasses because I break the most high
up lenses out accidentally all the stuff
I said on my stuff and I blow up i crush
them so these primal roots they're
literally five dollars they have like
these like amazing chola designs on the
side and then they're just like huge
here we go living and I hate sunglasses
that show my eyebrows they have to cover
the entire thing because my eyebrows are
so prominent on my face that I feel like
it but you can see that through my or
above my sunglasses though you see and I
hate that so we gotta cover the eyebrows
then I have this Eucerin
skin coming dry skin body wash I just
went to the germ and so I have this my
mom gave me a sample the only thing
about this it's like a it's like water
is it's so watery oh my god oh my god oh
my god I'm making a mess oh my god
minimize
anyway fixed it thank you god I'm gonna
throw those away because this is gross
but the thing about like body washes
from the dermatologist or like uterine
brand or whatever um they don't smell
good they don't smell like anything it's
just like skin calming by then I have
Hollywood fashion tape
Hollywood's the brand they're just
little strips of fashion tape and you
peel the back and then you're just you
know your top or your dress he's
flapping up and you can like tape it
down to your skin so that it looks how
you want to look and you have to worry
about like a nip slip cleavage side boob
whatever
exploding so yeah then I have done we
all know I'm the gum queen here's Morgan
this is extra Powerman I love extra of
my favorite brand of gum
hey last long in my opinion and it's the
cheapest kind it's a dollar more Forks
then I'm a trustee fan oh this works
great I still use it all the time I pull
out for a music video no but you know I
will pull it out because I do get quite
hot a lot and like my body's just
overheating and this is a nice way to
calm down the nerves calm down my buddy
so yeah I just cool off with that I'm a
headache my sandwich I take excedrin for
headaches I have this perfume which is
really good it came in a boxy charm its
Realtree
that's what it's called and I just
really like the scent it's like a big
travel size I have an extra Mac angel

gotta have one we're blue go I have one
back there in my makeup bag in my
backpack and in my purse we got a lot of
my angel listen um I have a pen and a
shark beam I have a tampon cuz you never
know when that's gonna hit I just have a
bunch of trash bunch of gum wrappers I
can throw away now that's a nice way to
clean out your purse by doing this video
I like to hold her a like free underwear
from Victoria's Secret yeah a penny a
loose excedrin that can be thrown away I
don't know why that's there um I have a
post office like number ticket clear
eyes to get rid of redness I've never
used this so I don't really usually have
red eyes and then a lighter try it in
true just you never know who need that

lighter and I don't know why but I
