Kate Spade makeup bag it also comes with
a Kate Spade make a brush bag with in it
it came together so I love it it has a
loose little lipstick swatches on it I
think it's super super cute and I got
for my birthday visa in my 18th birthday
my 19th birthday huh this is my like
daily makeup I usually keep it in here
cuz when I do come home from college I
go back very quickly it's a turn around
the weekend so I will just keep it in
here I won't put it in a makeup question
or a different bag so this is kind of
like an everyday migratory without the
tutorial part as well it's kind of just
everything that I use daily so I'm just
gonna put it right here and then we'll
go through it all so not further ado
let's get started this is what the
inside looks like it is packed full of
all this stuff but I'm gonna start with
what I have in my makeup brush bag which
is the same lipstick swatch print and
like I said they came together in a set
but I'm just gonna show you the
mandatory brushes that I haven't even
these are the brushes I carry with me
daily um to and from wherever I go there
I brushes face brushes and concealer
brushes and stuff like that so I will
just go through these very quickly and
tell you what brand and what kind they
are I'm gonna use them for so first I
have a luxe C 211 concealer brush I like
to use this to smooth the inner corners
of my eye like right there the concealer
in punishing out I have a Mac 217 se
brush which I adore it's like a small
little fibered brush is nice for getting
in the crease with with a darker color I
have a royal and langnickel Master Pro a
large eyes shader bmp-1 48 great all
over patting a big glitter pigment a
regular shadow or anything I just spray
a little fix+ on this and then go in
with my main lid shadow this is a real
techniques how to put brush I use this
for just kind of smoothing out bronzer
all over I don't use this as much
anymore but I did use this a lot in my
past and it's just a stable brush to
throw in there's just a large powder
brush so I'm gonna Ryan need it but it
does have a lot of fun I just have a lot
of products on it so this is a clean
powder brushes overall a nickel Master
Pro powder bmp-1 41 brush it's kind of
like a knockoff cheap Mac not really but
Mac has won some
this and it's next to contour with if
I'm going for a large blend contour then
I have a max my favorite brushes as well
as well tan like nickel if you couldn't
see that from this video I have Mac 219
this is a great for under eye when
you're buffing and shading color into
your lower lash line so that's what I
use that for I have a mac 242 brush
which this is like a nice one to just
Pat again glare pigment or a glare
eyeshadow on with I have an elf a small
tapered brush this is a great brush for
highlighter as well as elfs flawless
concealer brush I use these two for my
highlights I have your own line to Col
revolution BX 35 this is a great baking
brush
I don't bake as much anymore ice to
constantly but I'm going a little on
lighter with my baking and concealer and
my baking and bronzer recently but this
is nice to carve out those cheekbones I
have this brush which is new I love it
so Real Techniques it's the gold
metallic line and this is 102 and it's a
triangle shape to concealer brush if you
can see that and this is again used to
get in to the little socket of my eye
wear concealer and finish off and sits
and does not blend completely I love
this brush don't let you got Real
Techniques in the old collection because
they're so beautiful and I love having
that next I have a cheap one this is
kind of like the Mac 242
but a knockoff it's also it's a knocking
up knock off because it's broken but
it's nice if I have like a really dark
shadow or something I don't want to ruin
this brush with I'm just going with this
kind of ratchet one it's doing I'm a
brand sorry next my favorite brush ever
will named Nicole master ProTaper
blender BMP 150 this is just our sets of
staple I use it for all my transition
colors and blending over all my
eyeshadows I have another great brush
with makeup geek 180 crease brush this
is kind of like my Mac 217 se which I
will use they're kind of smaller thinner
for just to find that crease with a
darker color before I go over the lid
color I have a Vasanti brush which this
is blush number seven is what it's
called but I use this for bronzer if I'm
going in for a very defined bronzer line
and I will just kind of you know dab it
on with this and then use my Real
Techniques powder brush to blend it out
and I have my favorite brush overall by
far it's my shade and light brush
by Kat Von D it has this amazing powder
brush which fits perfectly in the under
eye socket and just everyone the phase
to blend out powder setting powder stuff
like that press powder loose powder and
then we have this amazing contour brush
which I use over any other contour brush
all time everyday use this brush love it
so those are all the Russians that I
will carry with me and I'm gonna go into
the main part of the makeup dirt so also
in the part that the brushes sit in I
have this palette which sits upright
this is my love Lea travel palette I
have mostly makeup ich shows and a few
um like I'm my favorite Mac one so I
threw in here I'll go quickly through
which ones I carry with me but this is
just a Z palette it's hot pink I think
it's the size large and it's just my
everyday shadows I can do any makeup
look I went with these I did a video on
my favorite makeup each shows so check
it out if you haven't already but yes I
have Houdini shimma shimma cupcake and
the Coco bear creme brulee cosmopolitan
corrupt latte peach smoothie daydreamer
white lies bitten Grand Stand and then
this is a over I like banana setting
powder I just have my way here for
under-eye if I want to go in with like a
yellow setting powder so those are my
makeup geeks and then Mac afraid of red
brick nylon and amber lights so these
are just daily ones that I will use
apparently I use BB eye shows every day
but no this is easy for me to carry back
and forth so I don't carry much of
eyeshadow palettes with me I just
carried that and we're good to go for
everything
umm so then the rest of this mess I'm
just going to go through first day like
this lifesaver this is an eye shot i
shadow eyelash case I do not have
anything to put my eyelashes in but you
can lose these and I were quite
extensive eyelashes I think I don't want
all our eyelashes anymore you know they
are pricier so I have them all in here
at top and bottom and there's a nice
little home I suppose I take them off I
clean them and I put them back in its
home so I don't lose them and can keep
rewriting them because they're kept away
from dirt and bacteria I have my
finishing and primer sprays by skin and
Navy I love these lovelies to death this
is nice too wet in your face and get it
ready and moist before I put on
foundation or makeup and this is a
setting spray for afterwards I haven't
used a lot more of this though I can
feel it and wait but I had those I all
times with me my Beauty Blender that
needs to be cleaned with my Ivory soap
which I used to clean it if you're
wondering how I clean beauty blenders
it's with Ivory soap it's like the
beauty and a cleaner from Sephora but
it's a dollar verse 16
it's the exact same it's not better and
you just scrub the top and bottom or any
spot that you use in your video winner
till it gets all clean which it gets
perfectly cleaned by this and you're
good to go so it was up those two with
me um I need to use tape everyday to do
eye shadow but I feel like I become a
little better at eye shadow on its own
so I don't need to use tape as it was a
security blanket I do still love to use
it and I think the great thing to do use
tape to get precision over their eye
shadow but I have amazing it recently
that being said I do always keep a roll
of tape with me in my bag in case I do
want to sharp crease a cut crease or
something that needs precision I have my
mac fix+ this is a definite must for me
because all my eyeshadows are usually
glitter or some kind of shimma shimma
shimma shimma no cut some kind of
shimmer and so I will use this to spray
my brush before and after application of
the shadows to place them on and they
just glue and hold so much better to my
lid when I do use mac fix+ I have two
loose powders they work the exact same
in my opinion I have covergirl
professional loose powder which I'm
almost out of it's taped because it's
broken the lids are so cheap on these
but I still love it and I Laura Mercier
translucent press powder which I also do
adore but they work the same so if
you're gonna make fifty or forty first
like five which one would you go for you
know they work the same
you do work great but they work the same
so I just carry both of them because I
need to use this one up but I do enjoy
using the laura mercier quite often as
well so I just came I go through me is
it necessary enough the next thing I
have to up this my favorite concealer
it's Maybelline master conceal in the
shade 20 light this one is what I'm
using right now and this one has a
wrapper on it I just bought it um for
whenever I run out of this one just so I
am on guard and ready for when I am out
of it because I can never be without
this concealer it's my life it's the
best I have a glitter pigment from Mac
that makes a mess but I adore it over my
eyes right now it's reflects gold I love
the reflects line of Mac they're really
like out of every color on the line
right now much pisses me off because I
want silver and pink and teal but
they're all out of them it's like the
wait for that to come back in stock that
I have reflects gold currently and I
adore it so tip of that I'm gonna have
to face glitter glue works like a charm
on my god you're not use regular primer
that's not what that needs it needs
glitter glue stick correctly so I have
to face whether glue it's the only I
feel like another place
another brand is glitter glue but I
can't put my finger on it what brand
that is but I've no chief a since I
bought that one okay um I have two
bronzers at NYC smooth skin runs ER and
Maylene dream bronzed amy cream I love
drugstore bronzers over hand I found
high on these great ones but I do enjoy
the drugstore a lot better this is what
I won right now NYC it's literally so
cheap and this cheap packaging which
pisses me off but it's so cheap um but
get an amazing formula oh my god so so
creamy mm-hmm love it you can't see it
at all except my lights too bright but I
look I adore this this is definitely
worth it anybody that it is like 2.3
dollars so this is my favorite because
it's so natural and easy to blend then I
have my dream runs BB crania which this
is a BB cream but it's a bronzer so I
will put this oftentimes underneath my
bronzer powder if I just want a nice
like face wear it and then I'll set it
with a powder this is just so much more
natural-looking than just harsh the
powder all the time so that's why I will
use this it I really love this product
so definitely check it out not sponsored
but loved it
after she must scare us currently I have
my L'Oreal telescopic mascara which I'm
in love with and then benefit they're
real which I've had this for a while but
I haven't used it so it's like I need to
use that for dries out cuz I just ran of
but better than sex but your face which
is my favorite ever but this one is very
good at separating which um it's not my
favorite I wouldn't rebuy it but it is
very good at separating which I enjoy
and this is just amazing the brush is so
skinny and long and makes your lashes
skinny and long as well so much you miss
here is which I apply my bottom heavily
and a coat before I apply falsies or
false lashes I have a house of lashes
black eyelash adhesive I excused you all
the time but it is a little annoying
because it's white I know do i mix black
but I just want to try this it does work
well but I find it to be a little weak
you don't have to wait till it gets
tacky
live for that but I often find my lashes
coming up super easily and more easy
than I ever did with duo which just
shows you oh it's so much stronger I do
love this glue but not my favorite and
it stains everything I've seen my bed
with it because I didn't make up my bed
once my Beauty Blender has a freaking
mark
laughing my mirror like it's a mess oh
well I have a pair of trimming scissors
as well as tweezers those are just
necessities to me have my ELF eye brow
gel to glue my eyebrows down I have two
lip liners I have Mac Posie perfect
which is perfect which is a perfect lip
liner for Angel and then I have macro
swirl it's just a standard classic
perfect Mac lip liner which I'll often
just color my entire lip in not line it
just color it in and this is kind of
duplicates as a second lipstick because
you literally lipstick I have in here is
max angel my true trial of I'm a little
sad I have to get another one it's like
my 19000 tube and then over time I will
use NYX butter gloss and creme brulee
and I adored that as Trisha Paytas had
it so I bought it and that really Paint
Pot eyeshadow primer which I've hit pan
on sigh needing an element soon um best
eyeshadow base don't need any other one
I have Becca highlighter in Champagne
Papa Jaclyn hill which I love but I also
love using my eyeliner for my eye shadow
nylon from Mac as the highlight which I
have it right now it's more pearl rather
than Rose which I love the pearl look
but I fix this with rubbing alcohol cuz
I cracked it amazing still love this so
so good
Becca's highlights are credible my card
foundation is fit me again I love fit me
foundations but I have the correct shade
this time I don't have orange it's 110
porcelain in the dewy smooth line
because they have like the regular line
the matte line and the do be smooth so I
have a duty to and I enjoy this then I
have this um eye liner charmer from
Revlon and the last of things in here
are my two eyeliners which I adore 24/7
glide-on missile better indicate in the
shade perversion
I don't like Mac's eyeliners too much I
love everything my Mac but Max eyeliners
formula just as much as a lot more than
24/7 or Medicaid does but oh well and
then I have tattoo liner in trooper by
Kat Von D and that is everything
that is everything in my bag I hope you
