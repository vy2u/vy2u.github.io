clothing collective haul it's a lot of
stores that are extremely cheap online
so I wanted to try them out test them
I'm going to tell you which ones are
good and you should go get them what the
flaws are which ones aren't so hot and
stuff like that these are cheap online
stores that come mainly from China so if
you have prom with that whatever click
off the video but um for the most part
this is very good quality stuff some
steps a little like and sometimes not
from China but we'll get to all that
when I'm doing each individual store
Gramlich site except been collecting
this for a while now I always wonder if
these stores are legit if they're
cheetah they rip you off if it's good
quality bah blah blah and I'm going to
tell you today what is and what isn't in
my opinion so without further ado let's
concern with a huge collective clothing
haul first is dresslink calm um first
things I got were to makeup brushes I
wanted to see the quality of the makeup
brushes from this online stores um first
one I got is called maa and GE 834 and
it's in a huge thick fan brush it's not
like a flimsy one it is very thick and
durable and I really do like this it's
for highlight and you just kind of like
put it right on there and I really do
like the quality of this brush um the
other one I got doesn't have a name but
it's the white and gold version of this
very very flat top kabuki small travel
size this is for mainly my stick
foundation I love using my Beauty
Blender on it but sometimes since the
purpose of a Beauty Blender is to pick
up any excess foundation it'll do more
picking up and spreading around and so I
want to try this and I haven't tried it
yet I didn't want to clean it first but
um it is very firm and I feel like it
would really buff that stick foundation
into my skin rather than the Beauty
Blender cutting it everywhere low Beauty
blenders but they're not super duper hot
for um stick foundation but yes I got
this to try it I think was very cute I
think both these are very chic and cute
and I'm excited to try these next I got
this belt which is disappointing I don't
have like any belts I have one for my
sister honestly and this one on line
didn't look like this it's one of the
ones that buckles in the back
um and it's like stretchy so it fits a
lot of different waists sizes however um
and it's black wall necklace is very
chic and cute but when you put it around
you if you can see this like this part
jolts out it doesn't bend to match your
body
like jolts out it just looks really
awkward especially when I was wearing a
dress and I went to cinch instant cinch
because my waist ended about here on it
and then this whole part was sticking
out and it was just very awkward so I'm
not even sure Hannah's belt it was cheap
so I didn't really lose any money on
these items by didn't like them but I
did this video like I said mainly to
show you whether or not I think they're
good quality and I just it's just part
of it is too Long's metal it's too long
needs to be shorter because it makes you
look really wide and awkward so not huge
fan of that next I got these red shoes
which you've probably seen these
everywhere online they're the bow shoes
but they look more like an X when they
are delivered I don't know I still think
it looks like a bow the most part but
just a little bit like an X as well
these are red feels like felts almost um
velvety they're by the brand jima shoes
coming from China I wear size 38 that is
a size 7 you have to find a British or
European shoe converter from American to
British sizes I know that my 7 is the v8
but you can check online for yours um
these you fit they're true to size and I
like them I love the color true rich red
but I wish this is more of a bow then a
X shape that's okay next I got something
I adore I love love love this it's fake
fur calm your tits
it is a black jacket I've worn this
quite a few times ready and it makes me
feel so bomb like I was like walking
around a restaurant oh my god I'm really
hot and my mom's like take off your
jacket but I was like no I feel like a
boss says Queen in this like it just
makes you feel like I don't know sexy
City likes lighting the scene I have a
black best that I do adore neither of
them are real far I don't support
killing animals for that but this is
artificial fur I'm sounding really like
fur feels like it feels more like just a
shredded fabric and I really like this I
just think it makes you look super super
chic and like Paris Fashion Week it's
just I don't know it's like I love it
that's what I see when I am wearing this
so I really am glad that I've gotten
badge then I got this blue bathing suit
if you have followed me for a while
you'd know that my Instagram pictures I
have a black bathing suit bottom that's
like this and it has all these strings
down the side it looks very oh my god
scandalous but it's not because it is a
high-waisted what covers almost
everything and then you do have these
splits but it was appropriate I work all
that summer and so I got the ocean blue
I think it's called sky
something like that version of it this
year in the top I don't know what's
gonna fit because I didn't realize there
was push-up in it so beware this pushup
I don't like push-up bras because I
don't really need it like I don't wanna
sound cocky but like I don't need
push-up bras they just make my boobs
stick out that much more and I don't
want them to but it is a halter top and
then it wraps around ties in the back so
I will try this I don't know what's
going to fit because I did choose size
small because I'm a smaller bottom than
I am a top but we'll try and if not
we'll just mix match the baby suits I
always mix match my bathing suits so
it'll work out in the end
next I got something that's very
disappointing it is a small black and
white rubber its striped it has these
long flowy fan sleeves the problem with
this is that I forgot I'm stores like
this Chinese all my cheap stores they're
white and cream clothings are extremely
thin you can see my entire hand through
this therefore you couldn't really wear
underwear I brought this and I don't
want to not wear underwear abroad
because then you can see everything so
I'm like I don't want to do about this I
guess I'll just throw it away because
honestly it is so sheer you can see
evany we see my ass you can see whatever
underwear I'm wearing so it's not cute
on um it looks rakin on the model but
you know you get things and they don't
match up the same way so I'm not a huge
fan of this I probably won't ever wear
this because it can't see it working
also I've like some slip that is the
shape of a romper underneath it next I
got another thing that's very
disappointing
um it is a black dress and it's supposed
to up
it's supposed to look like this okay you
all see it what is this whose boobs can
fit in this look at what what look at my
huge asshole there's not what it looks
like so this is yet again another thing
that does not look like the picture so
if you're interested in buying like this
don't get it look what what the this top
is not big enough for normal breasts of
any size um next thing I got is also fun
mate Instagram for a while and you saw
my summer post it's like bathing suits
on then you would know I had a one that
had all different colors from Target and
then they had one that was a one-piece I
love when pieces it covers all that we
don't want to be showing um but they had
one that was so into it
it has neon yellow orange and blue
straps all around on the side
on the back crisscross it is a one-piece
and it looks exactly the target one it's
good quality it has cups so you know you
won't be nipping through and I'm really
excited to wear this the baby shoes are
very trustworthy for the most part from
these sites sometimes the clothes are a
little in but the shoes and brushes and
medicines from those part are good then
I have this shirt which they advertised
it as on Selena Gomez on they have it on
her so I was like girl I need to get it
now right um it's not like the cutest
sure ever but she's wearing it so I had
to get it it's a white flowy sleeves
with a pleat down the center again it's
very thin but because it's a pink color
it doesn't show as much or if anything
through here because it is a darker
color but it is very sheer so be careful
getting yellows White's or creams
because that might not work out for you
but I do really like this it is a nice
material for the most part is
lightweight that's for sure because just
cute and choose by the big ones so I got
to pick one I think they have blue and
green too next from TV dress comm I got
my favorite thing ever which are these
blue shoes um that look exactly like the
ones from Manolo Blahnik um in Sex in
the City Carrie if you've seen it she
gets proposed to with these shoes bigs
like we marry me and she's like God and
so I had to get them they haven't in
different shades but navy blue was the
shade that she had in the wedding or in
the movie and um yeah I had to get these
I have you these I wear them so much I'm
just a my other one sealing problem is
don't be alarmed by the bottom they do
chair at the bottom all shoes that are
shipped from websites like this have
like a wrapper on the bottom that will
peel off and then it's just like the
shoe sole so you're fine it's fine
it'll do that then I got this black
dress which is actually really cute it
cuts down into V in the front you can
see that and then it's just like
lightweight flowy silky material it's a
little sheer in the bottom so I don't
know if it weighs for a bathing suit
cover-up or a dress probably a dress but
you never know it is so small all my
stuff that I got a size small except
that black for a jacket was medium but
besides that everything is a small um
and I just really like this dress it's
one of the things that I was like oh my
cool I can wait on you know summer
vacations coming up and I think it'll
look good genuinely um wearing on a
beach worn on a beach or whatever so I'm
really excited to wear that then I got
these black pants which I freaking adore
oh my god I think they're cooling black
has plus size sizes pants or
something like it says something about
plus-size is available which is amazing
but these are like black dress pants and
I didn't know if they would be like
dress pants or more like jeans or
leggings when I got them but they are
when you put them on a dress pant
material but skinnies and all of my
dress pants which I do wear just takes a
lot for a string Club I'm in feral flare
and not my like the cutest things so
these are skinny they have pockets in
the front and back they have pleats I
adore these definitely get these if you
are in any kind of business leasing or
if you have like meetings your
interviews coming up like definitely get
these for show comfy and they are tight
and form-fitting I got a small if you're
any bigger than a size zero or one I
would say go up a size because they do
run a little small I'm normally size
zero I'm not trying to say my size but
I'm just letting you know that these
pants ran a little small so these are
almost too small for me but they weren't
even so yes I'm really glad I got that
cuz I'll get a lot of you sound that um
the last thing I got didn't really work
out either I forgot again that white
when it comes is very very very sheer it
is a criss cross front and then this
okay I like the asymmetrical hem in the
design but this print is not was in the
picture we're so cute in floral then I
got it and it looks like I was printed
on and I blown up so it was blurry from
like a printer at a home I like it just
isn't a good design she looks like blue
blobs when it's so sweet like leaves and
flowers designs so this is a little
disappointing moving on to style we this
is not I don't think a Chinese um store
I think is from the US I could be wrong
I'll put it right here if I'm wrong but
this stuff is more high quality it is
very expensive so beware this is not one
of the cheaper ones but I'm gonna show
you I got from the store anyway the
first thing I got I regret I don't know
why I picked this out but it is a white
trenchcoat but it looks more like a
freaking chemistry lab coat I'm not
trying to be a sign in scientist so I
don't know what to deal with with this
it looks a lot here online and when I
got it was just one of those things I
was like hmm
so I don't really I can't see myself
wearing this it's really huge it's so
small and it just looks unattractive and
unappealing
so bye sorry not into it um the next
thing also I think I might have like
died when I was taking these
and so I don't really know what I was
doing I love these three but these other
ones also good uh-huh this is something
I would never wear I consider my style
very body con and tight I guess you
could say and so I wouldn't consider my
style this but I picked it out for some
reason it's black see-through mesh with
this rose print and then a cutout
stomach and a huge huge skirt I like it
it's very cute if I saw it in someone
else I'd be like yes girl rocks my mom
but I'm like from me I don't know what I
was doing I wouldn't I love roses so
much but I wouldn't wear like a rose
print dress per se you might see me in
this don't get me wrong but like this
isn't the first choice I would go to if
I were picking outfit out for the day
next I got my favorite thing ever oh my
god
oh this I look like frickin Mozart oh my
god I love it it's a black tie blah blah
look at this ruffle detail like amazing
ruffle sleeves I cannot wait to wear
this with the black pants I think it's
gonna be so amazingly cute and chic I
cannot wait oh my god I'm so excited to
wear this I just think it is one of the
cutest items I've ever personally picked
out because sometimes my taste is a
little like what but this is very good
on my part I think so I'm really excited
to wear that as well as this next thing
it's a white blouse again and it buttons
all the way down the front just looks
very like olden days like 19 like 18 7
like seventeen eighteen hundred's kind
of know just me it buttons at the top
and I just think is very very cute and
these items are not things that I
usually work so not showy but I love
that about them it's different for me I
don't have to wear the tightest showiest
thing you know so I'm expanding my
wardrobe a little bit because I did
clean it out recently so I can add some
new things and I'm excited with my new
pieces um the last thing you probably in
serum array it's this black pleated
dress with a white color and white
sleeves very very cute it is very boxy
however beware it is extremely extremely
extremely boxy so when I put it on it's
not form-fitting at all I just not sin
to the waist very much it just kind of
like goes down so I wasn't a huge fan of
it um I do love this it is very preppy
and adorable but like for me I wouldn't
choose to wear it I don't think again
over anything else
because it is just very like go straight
down and it's just like not my scale the
last oh my god I'd say was the biggest
fail out of all so I don't realize how
much
this hall was that's okay um none of the
stuff looks like picture or likes gonna
fit
so yeah I'll just show you I'll just
show you
first thing is a knock of our teeth
brush and so I wasn't gonna buy an
artiste brush artists artis artist I
don't know I say it but um it looks like
our teeth so I wasn't gonna get an
exciting thing I'd like it so I was like
let me get one of these fake ones and
try it out it's like a dollar too and um
I don't like how this feels so I don't
know if I want to put this on my face I
don't think it feels how a normal one
does it was called a tooth brush brush a
tooth brush mega brush so in the end I
don't think that this is anything near
when an artiste would provide me with
quality wise so yeah I wouldn't suggest
buying one of these knock-offs it's not
the same it's not gonna do any good it's
like the Brussels the bristles like
don't even move so then I got this
bathing suit these are the bottoms it
looks like Randy panties but I mean
maybe I could work it it looks kind of
cute but the top is supposed to be a
wrap top and it just comes like this it
looks like frickin scarf I don't know
how to put this together I didn't know I
was enough to create my bangs you to
wear it then I like this this is a um
asymmetrical hem skirt bodycon skirt so
it's very tight I got it in black small
and yes it does cut up here so it's like
a it's like a different shape and stuff
so it's not just a normal pencil skirt
it looks a little big however I don't
know
it'll probably fit me um I sometimes
forget how big actually I am um but I
don't know it just looks a little wide
so we'll try it we'll try it this is the
most disappointing thing ever this is
what the picture looks like okay you see
it okay this is what I got it looks like
a potato sack I don't really understand
what this how this even resembles that
that will be thrown away next we got a
bathing suit I don't what what is one of
these crisscross things what what is the
point of that and then this top is um is
fine I guess it's just not the flat most
flattering I'm telling you this one is a
fail then I got this um blue romper but
the problem again that I forgot what
this is it first of all for this year in
second ball
why these robber legs are this is one
rapper leg this is big my whole weight
stop
so get again fail this I got this
necklace um that's actually dirty you
can kind of see that it's like already
dirty so that goes in the trash then I
got this okay it's it's a brush a place
for you to hang your brushes after you
clean them that the water doesn't get
into the like base of the brush because
the glue within unhung unhinge and the
brush will fall apart you try to set
this up it's like little squishy okay it
said it was coming in black I'm pretty
sure this in black but you're supposed
to be able to like put this in here and
then have it dry upside down to the
water will drip out so I think this will
work for the most part let me see this
little stand because the work this looks
cool because you don't want to get the
water um up in your brushes so I think
that is a good thing the last thing I
got are the same Bo X whatever shoes in
pink um I ordered these before I got the
red ones I should have waited I guess
cuz they do fit they are my size 38 in
their cute pink velvet color but again
this doesn't look like a ball it looks
like an X X is a nose eye
so that was my oh I hope you enjoyed

hope you learned what you should and
shouldn't buy from these websites if
