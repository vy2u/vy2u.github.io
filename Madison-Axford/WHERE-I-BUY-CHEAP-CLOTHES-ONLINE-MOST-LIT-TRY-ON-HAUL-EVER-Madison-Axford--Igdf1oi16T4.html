overhaul for you these are my favorite
ever hauls to do the clothing is
freaking me to a cheat going fashion
overage check it out you will not be
disappointed is littering my style in my
wardrobe on the side you know how Hall
works it's a Tryon so this is better so
let's get started first thing is what I
am on is this beautiful bejeweled like
little design black
oopah tight dress and I love it
so it's super super just like comfy
mature it's very soft and I love to like
metallic accoutrements the freakin metal
design all over it it's beautiful it's
very tight and I love the beads it kind
of distracts away from the tightness and
like my pooch my stomach so it's very
nice that it distracts away from that I
really love this design I love the high
neck very appropriate you don't swear
chores or anything you're good to go and
put this on you're ready to bail out so
I really love this I'm glad I picked it
up next I got a new addition 25 high
boot connection yes I have black
knee-high boots I have great we had this
and I wanted everywhere I just love them
so much so anyway I got the nude like
taupe ones me high heels beautiful I
adore them go get it right now fashion
OVA has the most adorable best knee-high
boots so comfy I never use from them
Vinnie had boots on there are amazing
then I got these little black strappy
heels that are open to I usually don't
like open shell but expen ever had a
pedicure my toenails are not cute but I
like have don't I didn't have a pair of
just like classic strappy black shoes so
I've already worn them a little bit okay
so I had to get them and you can see it
that is blood I broke these in like a
 so yeah these really hurt
because of the stiff backing so beware
but I think they're cute perfect for a
night on the town or like dinner they
were come family for about 12 hours that
day so they were okay but they weren't
hurting by the end of the day I never
complain though don't complain for you
know wear the heels but there felt it
and I just think they're super cute they
go with everything make everything look
that much more classy and adorable so
how to add this to my Hill collection
then I got this caged dress which is so
cute a little square detailing all over
it and it comes a little pair of you
know underwear like it comes with little
pair of booty shorts underneath and it
just looks so cute I always wanted a
caged skirt if you're a drag queen more
one like this and so I was like yeah
one like you Willem so his was pink but
this is black and it'll do for now I
adore it I think it's show beautiful on
so unique and one-of-a-kind no one has a
dresses like see-through booty shorts
underneath but bitch I do so I love it I
love the netting material and you just
see enough that is scandalous but not
enough that it's sleazy my life motto
next I got this freaking sheer as
romper I love it it's super cute but the
problem was it friggin inside out the
publicist is you need a fashion Tate if
you're going to wear this because it
needs to be taped down the front and a
perfect v-formation otherwise your boobs
and your tits will be hanging out with
the boys and when I got down for that
close mug don't let them show out tape
it down with something but I use fashion
tape from like Target it's beautiful
it's very short it looks super cute and
like you know classic black long-sleeve
sheer romper but you need to make sure
that you're taped down I usually wear
like a strapless bra with that um or
like nipple covers so yeah next I got
this amazing like black coat I needed a
black heavy duty code everybody wore
this like 20 times it's so cute it's
like light weight but not it goes all
the way down to your feet you look like
a frickin movie some when you walk out
on the town I wear it with like skinny
jeans or a dress or a skirt you just put
this over top and you look like you're
miss businesswoman I love that and
that's what you look like you look like
you run the town I love this coach Steve
makes me feel so like sexy and boss ass
like don't with me cuz I don't
with Drew okay I love this I'm so happy
when I saw that it's like a one of a
kind of thing you can't find many places
and it's so stylish then I have these
super cute leggings that look like Nike
or adidas or something but they're not
the fashion Nova so they're cheaper I
love it there's black all the way down
black leggings super like they're super
durable but don't you sinner thick and
then double white stripes going down the
sides I think they're so adorable
stretchy at the waist and I just I love
them I love passion of us bottoms and
like jeans and leggings the true to size
I wear size one and I M size one so know
that you're probably gonna be your
actual size and it's amazing that
they're so accurate on their then I got
a pair of these jeans I love them I love
the detailing on the front they're not
just blue jeans the jeans with a little
designer of the knee I I just think
they're so cute I need a classic pair of
like blue jeans that rips in him because
rips are the but like not when
you're trying to be like classy
okay
so yeah rips are cute but not all the
time so these can be dressed up or down
and I love them you know t-shirt or
blazer
either way the last thing I got is this
I love this I was looking for something
like this just the shape and design of
this is what I wanted it's like a taupe
color which i sounds gonna be more of a
light pink but I'm very having this like
taupe nude color look how cute it has
this like rope back in detail and then
it's beautiful it cinches in like on one
side and droops down it looks so good on
its short cute tight live love perfect
and commit you with a style we haul
everything is what I have on it's just
beautiful oh my god Cinderella blue like
cold shoulder but these little sleeves
halfway down um you know hi next shirt I
love the color I saw it and do I want to
sure like this is a very in I love this
so much it's very tight and ribbed
and I very very much I love it and will
get a lot of wear out of it um next is
the starter every time I'm wearing and
you've probably seen it in my Instagram
picture I love this shirt so much it
makes me feel like a pretty pretty
princess up in this okay I love it
it's a beautiful rose rosy color
I'm just freaking freaking obsessed it's
very long which is incredible because
everything I haves tighten bodycon so
for once I get something that feels more
comfortable Falah we yeah you can figure
more pants under it no no no I love it
it's so comfortable and just super
princess like it sounds so cheesy but I
feel like a freaking real queen when I'm
walking around in this and it looks
great look like you're freaking Carrie
Bradshaw Sex in the City part with a
little pair of black stilettos on QT and
you're good to go glam that shabby chic
up
I got a bathing shippings it's a very
hard for me to find I want to let you
know right here before I get going with
this as the tops run very small so if
you are flat-chested or an at 30 to 34
even a cup these would be good to go but
I am bigger than that and they don't fit
me on a small bottom but a large top so
it's hard for me to find stuff but I got
this cute little few shot it's come kind
of red but it's a fuchsia pink color on
bottoms and then the top doesn't really
fit but you know we're going to pretend
it does for the sake of the video I'll
give to someone that it will fit though
a beautiful floral like little top I
love that so you can never see your
nipple poking through and
ties in the front to give you massive
cleavage I love this color and I loved
the frilly top it wish it did fit a
little better so it would be more you
know deemed appropriate but I do love it
all the same and I just really wanted a
floral top I've seen those variants out
recently so moving on I got a few more
meetings since this one does quite fit
me I can get away with it it's the one
piece you saw me is your picture I love
one pieces I think they're so comfy but
it has this beautiful um like bustier
that goes down to some cutouts around
the ribs and then just a long high
waisted bottom I love it it's all one
piece snaps in the back ties in around
your neck it I just love it my buildings
a little over the side because like when
I can find a freaking vase we talked
about does fit me but it does work
better than this one in the other what
I'm about to show you but I love it I
love love the swimsuit so much this
thing looks so flattering it's learning
when it's a one-piece one pieces can be
sexy you just got to know how to work it
right so next is this a beautiful
beautiful blue color
um bathing suit and has is it a like
rich on the side I usually like sides
that tie so I can adjust if they're too
big or small but it is how these cute
little ribs I really like it but the top
again doesn't fit I don't know how I
thought AB and L would fit I've got this
dress which um it's okay it's not my
favorite I think it'll it looks better
on and then just hanging here it's a
little big for a small but it's this you
know white dress with silver metallic II
sparkles all over cinched at the waist
and kind of like a skater skirt bottom I
do like it um it's a little long and
it's hot I don't know why I think this
out it's very not me but I'll rock it
like I do many things because sometimes
it's very hard for me to find outfits
that are solely always body con
sometimes I guess having my comfort zone
which is what I did there next thing is
also very different for me but I really
fell in love when I saw it it's this
herringbone dress with his like black
Sparkle detailing on the top I
absolutely adore this it's also very
different from me very preppy not my
typical style but I loved it it does
kind of cinch the waist again and then
just goes out to a big big skirt it is
very long and very appropriate for
everything I love herringbone though I
just thought it was very cute the last
thing I got is a sweatshirt I love Salvi
sweatshirt so much I had a white one in
my last hole and this is a black and
grey crisscross when they're so unique
and almost fancy dare I say they're not
just like a sweatshirt hoodie you throw
so
no they're like more this is zipper
detailing like I love the different
colors in the accoutrements I love it I
love the color-block beautiful
definitely glad that I picked this up as
well so if you're not already check out
style we what are you doing I'm doing a
channel haul from is a full and 2020 app
I like Sifl
the thing is a lot of the clothing is
not like it's pictured the customer
service is unlike any other they're
literally the nicest people in the world
and answer you so quickly but some of
the clothing product clothing items I
was like first I got two minute
sunglasses and I don't really like
either room this is the first one it's
like these blue shades that are white
and then they also have this like
leopard detailing under the eye here
they are on and I just don't really like
how pointy that cat eye is but and if
you starting the other one so they're
okay they're cheap all this was so cheap
some yeah this is the first okay there
okay I might wear we don't on the second
pair girl
why is all big like I literally
can't with how big these are I look like
a bug are you right girl no one's seeing
my face today so if you have really bad
makeup day get these and just cover
those babies up they're cute whatever
then I got this bag which kind of looks
like a knock-off designer and I really
liked it it's like this plaid with red
leather detailing and the silver chain
accoutrements so I do like it it just
kind of like pops on open and then it's
so good it has another red strap it's a
good sized die I mean I like it it is
very cute so I'm very happy with that
then I got a bathing suit which this
bathing suit it doesn't fit I try to
make it fit and it didn't but it is it
is cute I thought the leaves were gonna
be like green but they were blue and I
was a little thrown off by that but it's
cute it's durable it's heavy-duty so
they do have good swimwear they've all
many swimsuits on there
I just couldn't pick from any of them or
any of them because like I knew they
wouldn't fit I thought I would have a
little better chance with that since the
cups or small there's no push up but we
still don't have much luck but I do
think it there is still very cute and
then I got this van Halen tour of the
world 1984 shirt it's a little v-neck
little sports tee like baseball tee I
love it I just was very cute it's a
little thin for my life
but you know oh well tour dates I love
it I got this beautiful pink dress I
think it's so cute and perfect for
summer it has a huge open back and it
has this like floral lace detailing all
around it it has this little three ring
thing right there by the boobs and then
it's just a normal like pink little
sundress I thought it was so cute it's
tight and so I was just like yeah mine
moving on is another dress so sheer and
tight I was a little confused
it is a asymmetrical hem and it cinched
on one side kind of dress black jig
v-neck plunge but the thing about this
is like it's kind of a wretched material
it's very very very thin and I just feel
like maybe a baby's you cover up them
because it may be a little inappropriate
to wear any much more wear anywhere else
next I got this which I love this dress
it's again a like a symmetrical like top
and then just nice and then a rack round
bottom super cute super purple for the
beach little wedges ties around the back
I love it I think it's your nautical
it's black and white in case you were
wondering not Navy and white but it's
black and white I love to square back on
this and I just think it's super cute
the next thing is so disappointing I
don't even understand what happened with
this they said jeans shirt so I'm
thinking is a cowboy Jean shirt dress
and it comes and it's like a blue long
sleeve awkwardness like I hate this no
this is not a don't buy this is not a
jean shirt it's not it's a blue piece of
fabric that's long and like not cinched
I don't understand anyway next I got
like one of these infamous jackets it's
super tiny though I have one already
that's like a leather jacket with this
hoodie arm and I got a denim jacket with
like a hoodie arm and striped it's very
cute
I have to wear it open because it is
very very tiny I got a small cuz I'm
most normally small on tops I thought
I'd be a small in this and it's just
really really short so I'd have to leave
it probably unbuttoned unzipped unhinged
when I do wear it because it's so tiny
and then I got this leather jacket which
I wanted one like this for a while with
these like striped details on the arms
because I have one that just kind of has
like silver like you know ku Tremont's
all over and zippers and stuff but it
doesn't have like this pleated nasai
wanted from a leather coat and this is
heavy duty very nice material thick
leather coat so I'm very happy with most
everything that I
got from there a few things really quiet
but for the most part I'm very happy
with suppose so yes Emily check them out
in the other stores 2020 app and I love
this is a very very like boutique II
happy store um the first thing I want is
this blue and white striped oxford I
adore it it's like a girly cut so it's
not too long you can't pretend it's a
boyfriend shirt because it's too short
but it's very girly and feminine and I
love it I just love kind of oxford any
things and then I got this little grey
just like crop top I have a lot of stuff
like this but I was like hey why not add
another one to the collection I have a
pink one like this so I got a gray I
like its high neck so you know loops are
popping out but you do have to wear like
kind of straps for our sign because of
the tiny neck straps I really like it
it's not too much of a crop that it is
still appropriate then I got this
beautiful lace romper I love it it's so
pretty it's just these beautiful tiers
of ivory lace and in the back it has
this beautiful design of criss-crossing
it hooks around the neck and then Criss
crosses with an open back I adore it yes
it is pants cause it's a romper and I
just think it's super cute and you can
totally dress this up gaylord words to a
wedding if you put it with the red heels
so yes definitely excited that I got
that then I got another bodysuit I have
a black one of these and like a rose a1
and I love these and I got it in nude
this time it's one that has a drop back
and it halter neck I love it it's a
glitch hard like unitard so you do wear
it with obviously jeans pants skirt
short whatever but I love it it's
perfect for like going out in the bar so
wherever you're going I am going there
but you know wherever you're going wraps
around your neck and it's super cute you
look like a ballerina then I got this
rosy kind of colored top it's a
boyfriend tee so it's very very slouchy
but it made it girly by cinching it on
one side I don't I'm not a huge fan of
this inch but you know that way you
don't have to tie it because it is very
slouchy and big so you might want to
kind of cinch it somewhere so there you
go did it for you gonna beat the little
tie I really like color the shrink throw
up with anything under any kind of
jacket going to the airport going to
school whatever throw this on and it
automatically makes any of it look that
much more put together and cute last
thing that I got and lasting for this
whole is this beautiful dress which I
was so shocked they had because most
this stuff is like preppy and t-shirt
again whatever and also they plug this
number that's all Bangor oh I love it
it's a long black dress I love
dresses sometimes because they're not
always they don't appear sleazy because
there are a long cut and they do hit you
way below the knee it's a deep net
plunge however but I love like the
spaghetti straps and it has this little
cutout it's beautiful great fit very
tight but at the same time appropriate I
love it and can't wait to wear to a lot
of offense so definite you have to pull
