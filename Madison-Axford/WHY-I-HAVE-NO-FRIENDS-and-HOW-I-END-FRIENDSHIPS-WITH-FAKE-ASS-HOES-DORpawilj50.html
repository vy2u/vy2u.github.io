another talking video I do have makeup
on it's like oh my god the world has
stopped um yeah so I have to go some
after this that's why I put makeup on
otherwise what I had another day of my
face
still breathing and relaxing from the
mess and that was my chemical burns from
whatever the product and I just want to
address that really quick my skin is
doing better the redness has gone down
but the chemical burns have not they're
still predominantly there and it's very
clear and I don't know if you get on
here but um close up or someone talking
to me could definitely see them and it's
like annoying but um I know I address
this in a comment under my video from
yesterday that I left it on for too long
like I get that but the point was that I
was astonished and shocked that a
product this harsh could be on the
market um without specifying in great
detail on the backk do not leave this
one for longer it was just like a
recommendation like leave it on for one
or two minutes but uh um and almost say
that usually they're like 10 to 15 from
lush or Walgreens or Nordstrom Macy's or
wherever and everyone leaves them on for
longer because they're relaxing fun and
whatever usually unless they sting and
so um yeah so I left it on longer like I
do every mask every message is really
fine and this one wasn't like oh may
cause burns to the skin if left on
longer but it did and I'm dealing with
that now I do realize that was my fault
and I stayed in that many a time in my
video as well as in the comments section
but people still are trying to come for
me and it's just like sit your ass down
shut the hell up bitch I don't have time
for that um anyway I want to talk but
this is gonna be short video like I said
cuz I have somewhere to be but I still
want to do this video every dixit love
talking and um I was excited to come
back on here today and do it so today I
want to address just real quick think
friends oh I've had a million and a half
of these let me tell you I don't know if
because I do you to wear because I have
a really loud personality or what it is
but I've somehow attracted a lot of like
fake friends over the years and I feel
like a great way to see if a friend is
fake is first of all if they talk about
you behind your back
it's over done No
if they stick up for you when you're not
around that's a huge factor that I I
consider when when realized we want you
how much your friends are um and then
also who wants to hang out with you but
you don't have to ask them because
you're constantly the one that's like a
what I know when hang out want to get
together but that's not that's your
friend that's not a point and sure you
may have fun with them but like a true
friend should equally be contributing to
this relationship it shouldn't be very
strongly one handed on your side doing
all the work to keep this relationship
up and going um so yeah I have like I
said I don't have a lot of close friends
I have a million and two friends but I
don't have a lot of close friends
because I'm very particular I've been
fucked over so many times before and so
I'm very particular with who I let into
my life and and what I let them know
about me because there's a lot under the
surface to Madison that you know creates
this puzzle that is me I'm not a very
easy lock to solve so when I let more
people in and know more about me I have
to be very comfortable and confident
within that relationship and with them
to feel comfortable you know girl or boy
man or woman because I have both had
friends I have to feel very comfortable
them and I have to not like go through
levels to prove to me but basically they
have to prove to me that there would be
a good friend and I'm not seeing like
I'm so a most amazing magical friend
ever but my friendship is hard to
achieve I think and it not be nice you I
mean I see you will talk to you whatever
but might your friends know who they are
um and if you don't know if you're a
friend of mine I'm sorry probably not
and I feel like that's how everyone
should be we shouldn't have you know
when relationships like intimate
relationships we have standards that we
meet whether that's personality looks
whatever you know we do have our
personal standards and our personal
likings and I feel like not books per se
but but we should have standards
somewhat for friends as well because we
shouldn't let friends walk all over us
or treat us badly or use us or benefit
off of us while we are just like in this
relationship that's toxic um and I've
been that so many times before whether
it was for popularity or for more
friends or for connections or
you know you if you think you need to be
friends to these people what you really
don't at the end of the day I realize
that I would almost rather befriend such
as myself that have some of the toxic
friends that I'm now defriended annex
friended in the past I would just rather
have no one because of what they have
done ended and will continue to do to
people unless you're smart like myself
and got out of those relationships it's
just a friendship okay and it's easy and
friends how I end friendship is like
I'll just stop messaging the person and
if anyone's watching and I don't message
you right now or something like that
doesn't matter how to end the friendship
but you'll know if I'm putting it in the
friendship because it'll be clear in
avoidance and there's some reason
something I heard or know or found out
of why I'm ending a friendship so um
oh yeah I said I have a few few friends
but the ones you hear that is wind it
something tornado outside um the friends
we do have I'm so so thankful for and
and I treat them with utmost respect or
I try to at least and if we get in
fights or Tiff's we try to work it out
because we know our relationships
important to us um and yeah I can
honestly say I'm about four friends
right now that I trust immensely and um
I have a lot of other friends but it's
not the same um also another thing about
kind of others means when people ask me
friends or acquaintances or just people
who know me asked me to post pictures
with them on Instagram like I don't have
that many followers like I have
followers but it's not like I have you
know a million so I know people want to
post links like okay I get likes and
like can I get followers from this and
I'm like oh and I usually do because I
don't want to be rude I don't want to be
like not a puss and fish with you yo but
like I feel like should almost be more
selective because not saying everyone I
post a picture with it asks that but
some pictures that I think sense delete
it people will be like so pasta fiction
means grab it's good picture so you post
on Instagram and I've almost felt used
because I have a following it's just
like a very very weird world and so yeah
I've had friends that are people that
try to clearly just want to talk to me
to get the dish to get
shit to know what's happening and then
to spread it far and about and not ever
use me again they just want to get some
gossip about me and be like oh you okay
what's happening with this person was
good and then spread it and I know that
and I hear it and and people who are so
faked your face I pick up on that I
wanted the most realest I feel like
people that I know
I see everyone and pick up with
everything if you're talking about me
whether I'm in the room or not I know or
will know or will find out and I didn't
because I people telling me but because
I know when people are saying something
about me like I can see a face because
I've done it too I know that you're
talking about someone as you should
about me if I walk in in and into a room
and I'm wearing like a kind of like
risque or different type of outfit and I
see people give me a look and then such
a whisper I'm nowhere forget talking
about me know so I pick up on things so
much more which can be good and can also
be bad because I'm not ignorant in the
slightest and ignorance is bliss and so
when you pick up a lot of things in a
very negative person but I'm also a very
realistic person and I know that not
ever wants to be my friend and not
everyone likes me and I don't have to
please everyone and I won't please
everyone so I'm a very glass half empty
person but I feel like I'm very
intelligent because of that I don't have
these false hopes I don't kiss people's
asses so that they like me if you don't
like me get the hell out of my way and
get out of my face to get out of my life
I'm not here to please you I don't need
you to make me happy and I've gotten a
point in my life where I'm so confident
and happy with myself and my personal
growth that I don't need anyone else or
any other friendship or relationship to
define that or to validate that for me
or myself so the friendships that I have
are incredible I would be lost without
them but I only have a few so know that
if you're a middle school elementary
school high school college whatever and
you only have one to three friends or I
don't have any good friends right now
you'll find the good friends and if you
don't it it just takes time and know
that you have yourself and yourself is
sometimes the only person you could
trust in this world and know that you
should rather spend time with Netflix
basically or spend time you know going
out and trying to find friends or
exercising or working on your personal
development then trying to fit in with
fake people that make you feel
uncomfortable
um worthless and basically embarrassed
I never stick around with those people
never I'm not saying don't have friends
but find the right ones if it takes a
little bit takes a little bit but find
the right ones that's another thing it's
like ever since I graduated high school
people who low-key believe me not not
the people who actually believe me but
people who low-key went along with it
and laughed at me and and gawked at me
and mocked me and and thought the
YouTube is just so hilarious now try to
Facebook message me and be like either
ask me how I got semi-successful on
YouTube or ask how I'm doing or like oh
my god you look so pretty now this is
like it's such a backhanded compliment
or they ask like how I got followers or
if I can give them a shout-out I'm like
do you know who you are
first of all in what our relationship
was because it was non-existent
because you made high school hell for me
basically you made it suck so the fact
that you think I'm going to talk to you
and respond first of all following you
promote you give you tips or help you
must be out of your mind because no I
will not respond and you will be blocked
I've gotten upon my life where I'm not
going to be a bitch I'm sorry if it's
coming across that way but I'm also not
gonna put up with shit anymore because I
don't need anyone's freaking validation
except my own so yeah that's where I'm
at in life in this video I guess is
still talking ran thought I just went on
is meant to tell you to stick up for
yourself please to cover yourself know
that you're beautiful perfect and worth
it whether man women transgender
whatever you are know that you are
perfect as you are and you don't need
any certain people whether they're
popular or have Fame or have followers
or have a million different
relationships with boys and girl
whatever whatever that is that you think
you need or want or need to have you
don't you need yourself and you need
your inner strength and your growth and
know that you are beautiful and that you
are worth every inch in an amount of
respect as anyone else deserves in this
world so don't think that you need
friends can make your life better find
your true friends you will know who your
friends are because they will never talk
about you behind your back view but
never backstab you they will never
downgrade you or down talk you or use
your name to get in with someone
no they will use you non-stop if you let
them so you have just take a step back
realize who is important who is worth
fighting for and fight for those people
in those relationships and everyone else
can just fall to the wayside so I hope
you enjoyed this video I love talking
like this because I never had a bigger
sister and so I have a younger sister
stuff but I want to be your guys's
bigger sister because it sucks when you
don't have a bigger sister you're
growing up um you know as as the oldest
child in your family and you don't have
really experienced or anyone to talk to
you about this that's why I do videos
like brought underwear videos and
Imperia videos and stuff like this like
fake friends and in relationships
because you you need to know it
somewhere and if you are not unless
you're like a boss Queen you already
know this then I don't know where in
this video but just please take from
this that I'm confident and I went
through crap to come up to come out on
top and you can do just the same if not
more and if not better believe in
yourself please I'm begging you
you only get one life so don't waste
your trying to please ratchet asshole
