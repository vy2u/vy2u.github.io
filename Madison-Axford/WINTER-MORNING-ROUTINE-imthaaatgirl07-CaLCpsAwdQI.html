up a bit the first thing I do is get on
my phone to check Instagram and Twitter
just like everyone else in the world and
when I finally decide to get out of bed
I go to the bathroom to brush my teeth
and wash my face it depends on what I'm
doing that day but if I have extra time
I will try to make my bed as I am doing
here
nobody take me out though
sir about this today I decided to have
oatmeal and hot tea that I'm making in
my family's carry I just pop it in and
there goes then you just pour hot water
into the oat milk up and you are good to
go
and now it's a shower time but don't
worry I won't actually show you this
time so no one gets you know mad
and once I'm out of the shower I let my
hair air dry for the most part and today
I'm doing a really really simple makeup
routine so I didn't even show it it took
like two seconds time to pick out my
outfit of the day
really
cameras so we cannot forget deodorant
and perfume got my heels on and I am
ready to go out the door I really hope
you enjoyed this highly requested video
and check back later for more videos I
love you guys so much and don't forget
to subscribe see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
