posted this picture two weeks ago whoops
on my Instagram saying that I was going
to do a QA and um it took me a little
while to get here I had a lot of days at
work that you know I had to work and
then I got sick last weekend um so i'm
on my 4th day of antibiotics so she's
are supposed to take my medicine oh yeah
summer 2015 yes I'm just gonna hop right
in if I'm answering these questions many
times before I'm not going to answer
them again I feeling that that's kind of
pointless I mean most people who come
and rewatch my videos or come back and
watch my videos on my channel know these
things about me already from prior
videos but if the question I like am I
answer anyway anyway without further ado
let's get started the first question I'm
going to answer is why did you decide to
change colleges I've answered this
before i think but i might have been
missed it might a bit of video you
skipped or something like that so just
to clear the air nothing bad happened i
switched because of my majors better at
a different school and stuff like that
so i don't want people to think that
anything like bad happened and i'm
assuming a great experience i've said
that many times and i loved the people
that i met there but it was time for the
change did you take singing lessons I
did I took singing lessons for about six
years I think um everyone comments on my
like singing videos that I'll
occasionally do and they're like girl
maybe you'd be good if you take singing
lessons and I'm like that awkward moment
when he took them for six years I went
once a week and it was just it wasn't to
get me to be the most amazing singer per
se I mean yeah you always want to
increase your skill level but it was
just really fun and it was something
that I thought I was good at and so I
didn't go to volleyball practice I
didn't go to dance lessons I went to
voice lesson so it was fun for me it was
something different I don't take singing
lessons but yeah it's fun for me so
that's what I did advice for starting
high school um I know a lot of people
who've had rough freshman years going in
I on the other hand had a great freshman
year like freshman year can neither be
what you make it or does gets up it's
not like what you see in the movies
you're not thrown into a locker you're
not pushing through a trash can you
don't eat lunch in the bathroom I mean I
had eaten lunch in the bathroom before
but that was for it reason but you know
is what you make of it and I really
enjoyed my freshman year you get all
these new experiences you get to go to
probably football games if your school
has them school dances if your school
has them you know each school depends
but that's what my hat at least it's
just really cool we have a lot more
freedom and a lot more classes that you
can choose from for your schedule and
stuff like that so it's really fun and
um you know high school is what you make
of it so you can either have the worst
four years of your life or you can make
the most of it and I thought that's the
same for any situation so that's what I
recommend you do and that's what I did
for the most part the most part of my
high school career but yes definitely
the most of it and don't be afraid own
who you are because there's not one
other person like you in that school or
in the world so just be who you are
you're gonna find the true friends at
stick beside you through everything that
happens in high school have I ever been
to any concerts yes I went to my first
one was Jesse McCartney throwback Disney
Channel right i think that was like two
thousand eight then i went to taylor
swift and i've been to like a kristin
chenoweth one that was at a theater
those was very nice but that's it I
think I'm not a concert person I'm not
at all any advice for having a thing
with a guy have fun like you only live
once I'm be careful you know be safe
with what you do that came out really
weird I'm not talking about sexual
things I'm talking about don't be afraid
to just go on a date and you don't talk
to people um via be safe with who you
choose to go with be careful and I'm
enjoy yourself because you're only young
once and um it's like once you're my age
group work second you to like find a
husband and call now shaving but
seriously it's like oh my god I just
want to like be 14 15 16 again because I
didn't do that kind of stuff when I was
that age I just sat in my room you know
and played on my computer and so now
it's like crap I'm a little my nightfall
but you know whatever we're making up
for it now I guess kind of ish and what
do you think about gay marriage in the
Equality that happen this week wow that
was a while ago so I guess that's why I
like this was two weeks ago so I guess
this would have happened I love it I am
so happy um if you don't know me
personally you wouldn't know let me know
I guess you wouldn't
because I talk about freakin RuPaul in
every video that I put out as I'm to do
with RuPaul basically now and I love the
show and it doesn't matter if you do or
not but I think that obviously shows
that I am supportive of different
sexualities and different types of you
know love and so I totally support it I
was like ecstatic like it doesn't relate
to me you know it doesn't matter in my
life it doesn't help me out or hinder me
at all you know um in it doesn't affect
me personally but just like I know so
many people who are on homosexual and
it's just like I don't know I was like
so happy for them I was like oh my god i
don't know i was just like excited for
them and for what they would get to
experience in their future so i don't
know it may be really happy and I don't
know or care what your stance is per se
on it um I hope you support equal love
but that's totally you know up to you
and whatever your beliefs are but I was
very very excited for it and happy that
it finally happened do you have a crush
or does someone like you I don't really
crush anymore it's either I like a
person or I don't right now know if
someone liked me I would not know
because no one has told me um I think
that this this thing with our generation
is like people are so scared to be like
hey I like you and I do do that so what
I like someone I'll tell them so I'm not
gonna waste my time crushing or liking
someone secretly like either which makes
me out of this or I'm gonna move on why
am I wasting my time on you that's how I
view that and so if someone like me it's
like no one ever tells me or no one ever
tells anyone I'm not just me like even
if I a boy or girl or boy boy or girl
and a girl down the street you know like
each other it's like this day and age
it's so hard for you like talk to each
other so it's always a hiding my phone
or an app or a dating app so it's like
who ever really knows if anyone really
likes anyone how do you act on your
period I honestly can say I don't act
any different like you do not know when
I'm on my period and I think that is a
great way to be I'm very lucky
know if I'm controlling like the pms
thing or if I just don't have it super
strong I really know how it works but i
can tell you you will not know when I'm
on my period because I'm that I don't
turn into like a bitch like I'm fine all
the time things you should know before
entering college I have done videos on
this I've done things you need to bring
me halogens you don't need Brandon
college my college dorm tour if you want
to see what i did 25 things i wish any
before college so go watch those videos
because this is not a college video per
se I thought this was funny do you ever
count your steps when you walk and I was
like what is this person asking then I
was like oh my god I do sometimes like
sometimes a bit like one two one two
three one two like it's weird favorite
lipstick color this baby pink it's angel
by Mac I wear it every single day of my
life did you delete some of your
Instagram pictures I thought you had
more posts yes I just frequently it's
not because like I'm like I'm like oh I
might get in trouble for this picture I
should take it down no obviously not I
don't post anything like that it's stuff
that I don't like went up there any more
like something like you clean out your
closet you can out your car you've met
your pantry whatever it's like that it's
like I cleaned out my Instagram like
sometimes I don't want those pictures on
there anymore it doesn't mean I'm not
friends with those people anymore it
doesn't mean that there was anything bad
dealing with that picture it's just like
I'm like in not really feeling anymore
goodbye like I love doing it I don't
know that's so weird like I know people
up that fence posts I like to keep it
definitely under 100 and usually under
50 just so people see who I am this
person you don't do like scroll through
a hundred thousand things to like get
the gist of who i am it's like here's me
either follow me or don't but yeah I
don't know it's just a weird thing I
like to do what are your plans for the
future recently I really just like one
of move to New York like I know I've
college everything so it's not going to
happen but I definitely would move to
New York and live just for six months or
something um I know that's a long time
but like it's pointless to move you're
not gonna live with there for at least
six months but I don't know if I want a
whole year I don't know if I'd like it
but I love to experience living in New
York and not just visiting it put like
oh my god New York is just so magical
once you go huh what is your favorite
genre a movie might if you know me my
favorite kind of movies are cartoons
like Disney I don't like seeing scary
movies I don't like seeing sad drama
movies comedy seton these things are
like kind of sucky and yeah like I
literally want to watch to the movies or
movies are just not my thing anymore
it'll literally be like Disney movies or
they'll I thing that really keep my
attention space I'm a five-year-old high
as your favorite bath invited such a
candle of the moment of all time
actually is this one right here mahogany
teak wood the only one I will burn
because that's the only one that I can
actually stand Abercrombie 24-7 in my
room would you consider yourself more
singer or more of a beauty group neither
I think I come across as thinking I'm
Sarah thinking I'm a beauty guru and I
know I've said that many times I'm like
being a beauty guru I'm not a beauty
guru I don't have the proper training
really and um when I seen Beauty grew a
judge me like a person who loves beauty
I don't think I'm qualified per se to
lick do people's makeup and like charge
for you know I feel like that's like a
makeup artist a beauty guru um so I know
some tips that I'm sharing with you
that's what this channel is um mainly
based around but i do like singing and I
don't want to put myself in a box oh
just beauty just fashion just hair just
singing because i like to do everything
comedy you know its logs it's fun for me
to do all and i want a person to think
oh she just says semi videos are oh she
just a makeup tutorials because i was
gonna squish my chin just makeup
tutorials and I realized that I'd so
much more to offer than just that so I
switched back but if you remember that
post like in April or May I was like I'm
gonna switch Jimmy witch trials and
everyone was like Emma so I'm back do
regular videos would you ever work for
Disney yes Disney if you're watching
this hook a girl up I would love to be
um in I like Disney World better because
that's the only have experienced and i
just am in love with it i've never been
to Disneyland I've been to disney world

different parks and stuff like that and
hug the girl up i would love to be MGM

funny i catalytic bell right I don't
look like Cinderella Snow White or area
I look like Belle ish and I would love
to do that I love theatre and that which
is the thing she mentioned be like oh
isn't this amazing it's my favorite part
because you all see
hey Disney I love you you'll love me
llamo what would be your dream role on
Broadway and why there's many first of
all I wanted to be alpha but in wicked
since I was like eight nine and fontina
and lay ms penny and hairspray those are
like the big ones but yeah I'm starting
to like this guy but i don't know if i
should pursue a relationship with him or
not need help ok if you like the guy and
you have any hint that he might be
interested in you like it's a random guy
like don't just be like i like you if
you kind of have texted or communicated
somehow start with effort start texting
communicating if you can get his number
if you can get his facebook um just to
see where he stands he's interested all
but um then if you are really like into
this like you're like i am committed one
hundred percent maybe try to get
together hang out see if he keeps
denying you hanging out which has
happened to me many times then move on
because it's not gonna happen it's not
worth your time if you want staying out
go from there you know and then maybe
tell him like oh I kind of like you do
you like me if he's like oh no I don't
really show that piece goodbye but if he
says oh okay well you try something else
take it slow but I remember there you go
