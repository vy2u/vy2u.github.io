with the stuff that I got it's um some
of it's a little more pricier than I
would usually spend on some unstuff um
so that's why I didn't get you know
bountiful bountiful amount of things but
I still got quite a bit of stuff um and
we spent like one and a half days shot
of our trip shopping and it was just
really fun really short great trip and
yeah so let's get right into this hall
on the first day that we actually did
stuff we want to like monuments and
stuff like that and it was freaking like
2 degrees outside and so um I thankfully
wasn't gonna bring mine on her face but
I did thankfully um and I just had like
a thin shirt underneath and it was crazy
I did that was not with weather what
that was predicted is protected to be
like 50 or 60 degrees and it just
totally was way colder than everyone
thought it was going to be so thank
goodness for these street vendors
because it was so cold that I like
really wanted another layer or something
another jacket something like that so
first at the street vendor that we went
to I got this nice like Washington DC
sweatshirt and I love getting these
touristy jacket shirt things when I go
places and just as Washington DC on it
it's gray and has purple sleeves and it
says Washington ac done this sleeve also
it's just nice and big and comfy and I
got a medium so it was large it's just
got me super warm it was super soft on
the inside so I $15 that's an amazing
deal and I I really like it I can see
myself getting a lot of use out of that
and then also for that same street
vendor I got some ear muffs now I didn't
have a pair of ear muffs and these were
only three dollars and so used to put
him on the back yard like that and I
mean there are those stylish thinks ever
but it was cold and I was desperate so I
got these there's like three dollars so
I mean I spent like eighteen dollars in
the first day but I mean I got some
heavy-duty stuff for the cold and that's
really happy with my purchases then the
next day went to the mall it was like
the Pentagon City Mall and um okay I
totally totally had a brain fart and
forgot what store that I got this first
thing at so I'm sorry about that
but I'm sure you get these anywhere but
I just got these glow head-to-toe
self-tanning
let's and they were like six seven
dollars I think I really I'm sorry I
don't remove the store but they just pop
open like this and then you pull out one
it comes with 30 towels and you just
like rub them on your face your legs
your neck
whatever your arms stomach I don't know
where you need to be tan but I'm super
pale and I just want to get head start
for tanning in the summer and I don't
even tan like when I lay on the Sun so
these will be just like nice to use to
get myself a little healthy glow don't
remember the store apologies again next
I went to Sephora and I'm going to the
mall um of the day we did I knew I was
going to pick this up I was like I need
to buy this time so was thirty dollars a
little more pricey than I like to spend
on makeup stuff but I got Porefessional
I've wanted this forever this I've heard
so many great things about this benefit
product and look how cute this is like I
just love it
um it's a primer in it like decreases
your pores apparently you might have
seen me already using in my airplane
makeup tutorial and I didn't put
foundation on after it so I can't really
tell you what I think about it yet but
I'll be happy to do a review if you
would like so comment below because I
mean I would want to see review about
this product cuz it's expensive but if
it works good it must be worth it so yes
I'm really excited that I got that next
we went to lash in them these aren't in
bags sorry I just kind of didn't want to
have the noise seen rustling stuff
rustling but anyway I want to try this
product for ever because a lot of
YouTube videos have it and it is greased
lightning tea tree cleanser this was
also in my you know airplane makeup
tutorial and this has done wonders for
my face already it apparently decreases
yours it's you know kind of dries them
up decreases redness and pus and all the
disgusting crap that comes out of your
face and zits and stuff and um this was
only like 1395 and I'm just super happy
cuz this is like a good size like there
was a freaking a lot of product in this
and it's gonna last me a while and it
was not even that bad to begin with so
yes I'm very excited to umm not really
try this but just use it in works I've
already tried it and I loved it I had
all these it's in my face when I came
back from Washington DC and they're
almost like all gone or at least they've
you know dried up and decrease on
redness next we went to Avon and I got
this brightening concealer in
illuminating pearl also my um
every eye makeup tutorial
yeah now I just wanted something like a
highlighter underneath my eyes I might
cheekbones down the bridge of my nose
stuff like that and this is amazing
they had like skin colors and stuff
because it is a concealer but I wanted
the illuminating pearl one if you can
see this just to use strictly as an
illuminator and not a concealer you
might not be able to see that but it is
like a white pearl ish color there's not
much product in this and so I'm trying
to save it rather than you know use it
every day but it was 399 it's so really
cheap makeup I love it
then obviously these things are like out
of their packages and stuff but I went
to Claire's and this was really pricey
it was such an impulse buy I don't know
what I was doing but I really like it
and it's just this cross ring it takes
up two holes so it's like two ring
fingers two rings and it's just a nice
silver long big cross and I just love it
and it's really stylish and cute then I
went to Rite Aid this wasn't in the mold
but I just want to throw this in real
quick and I got fresh complexion
covergirl concealer and they shade
classic I agree what was that face now
this is the greatest concealer ever this
is obviously gonna March favorites I
freaking love this more than anything I
got in this trip this is what it looks
like it was around six five six bucks I
think and it just blends so nicely
excuse my hand obviously it's not the
same color as my face this one's so
nicely and it hides under eye circles
like amazingly it just so well up that
and it just makes me look like more
awake and like it's lighter than my
foundation which I like you know
underneath her eyes supposed to be it's
supposed to be lighter so it does a
great job at everything hiding redness
dark circles everything you guys should
definitely check this out I've never
fabric it's so this amazing like oh my
gosh a new review on this product oh I
love it
and then finally from Nordstrom's that
in the teen section this was $10 which
is super cheap because they're teen
sections freaking amazing but really
kind of pricey
this was only ten bucks and I was
looking for a headband like this Miss
Megan makeup has a lot of these
headbands they're kind of like boho and
like urban and stuff like that and I
really wanted one so you can wear it
like a regular headband or you can wear
just on the top half of your head and
you can you know do whatever you want
with these little flaps and it's just
super cute and stylish and I'm hopefully
gonna get a lot of use out of it it is a
little tight so
dykes are frequent when I wear this but
um hopefully my head will get used to
the pressure and the tightness of it and
I can wear it a lot because I want to
get a lot of use out of it super cute
and springy and I just love this next
from Kate Spade I got this new iPhone
case you know if you know me I freaking
love iPhone cases so Kristen had to add
another one to my collection it's just
all hot pink and it's rubbery metallic
and on the inside it says live
colorfully I don't if you can see this I
just live colorfully on the back it just
says cocktail anywhere hashtag pop fizz
clink and I just love the hashtag that
they included and I mean I'm not a huge
fan of like what this means or anything
I just thought it was super cute and hot
pink and it's whoa $38 so I mean yeah
it's not expensive as other case pay
cases but I just really want another
Kate Spade and it's rubbery it's easy to
get on and off and I didn't want another
hard Kate Spade one and whatever
everyone so comment below if you want to
update it iPhone case collections I feel
like I've gotten quite a few since um
since my last one which got like over
20,000 views so like OMG was on stick
and then finally on the third and last
day of my vacation we went to this huge
forever 21 that Washington DC had to
offer and it was just amazing oh my god
if you live in washington DC you're so
lucky because it's freakin crazy
I loved it so the first thing you got is
this like it almost looks like a kimono
it's kind of like this really silky
jacket with this nice um like blue weird
design thing and it's just this nice
jacket with this collar little pockets
and a zipper they can wear something
under it and I just love this it's silky
and I don't this was so out of my like
normal style but I really really loved
it just 2480 so I'm glad I picked this
up then I got something that I've been
looking for a my own forever 21 but it
didn't have my size and they did have my
size at the Washington DC forever 21
thankfully you know flash leggings now
if you know me I'm freaking obsessed
with leggings is all I wear every day
and so these are just nice really
heavy-duty um and they were only 780 and
the thing about these makes them special
is that I'm obsessed with camouflage and
anything like that cool camo print I'm a
backpacks like that oh I have so much
stuff like that and so I was really
really excited to UM pick these out my
mom found him and I free
out then I got something also that I've
been looking for forever that's an
infinity scarf I haven't found one like
anywhere and this one was on sale for
$4.99 it just says pink and white you
know stripes and I just love this is so
nice and warm and you could see it in a
lot of my pictures I wore it as soon as
I got it and Washington DC cuz it was
quite cold again but the last pictures
of my Washington vlog um follow me
around thing I was wearing it and I just
really loved it it's super comfy and
soft and the last thing I got has the
tag still on it and it was 1380 and I've
been looking for babies to talk like

and it's just the strapless nice like
Boucher looking top and it has just like
flowers all over it and then nice maybe
blue the top s straps which I might wear
because I don't know if I wouldn't wear
like strapless and this is just super
