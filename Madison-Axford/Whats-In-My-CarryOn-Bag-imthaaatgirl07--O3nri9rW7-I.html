exciting video I'm doing what's on my
carry-on bag which um when I go on plane
trips you take a carry-on bag and so i'm
going to show you mine and what's in
line and this is really what i take home
i take the biggest bag i can find and
stuff it fall because you never know
when you're gonna need you know one of
those things in there so i bring
everything because i feel like i'm gonna
need this so let's get started okay so
the last couple of trips i have used
this ginormous believe a coach bag and
like look at this like it's the size of
the screen it's huge it's like shiny and
smooth and um i got this from a coach
outlet two ish years ago i think i think
it was around two years ago and it's
seriously the biggest thing ever like
look at this it carries all that i need
and it's stocked full like usual the
first thing I always bring is a pillow I
usually bring up like a small pillow pet
but i recently got this when i went to
new york and from the NBC studio thing
and just as friends on a fence when my
favorite shows like the little coffee
cup from you know there's at the coffee
shop and I just thought this is so cute
it's black and it's small and it's very
good for your head I love it so yes it's
small in portable and it's good for
plane rides next I have my phone avi
like why wouldn't I not have my phone
it's just my phone you know you gotta
listen to music or you know watch movies
you stuff like that you always need your
phone I really don't take purses when I
go on vacations I'll just you know
usually wear like pants pockets address
the head pockets and I'll put my phone
or earphones or money or slang in that
so yeah I don't have like a person here
because I don't take purses on vacation
or if I do I'll just stuff in my
suitcase that goes under the plane oh
and also when I do go on plane rides I
usually wear a nice like long sleeve
sweater and this is just a black sweater
I got from my local store and then I'll
wear shoes that are easy to get on and
off because when you go through security
you need to get them on an off quickly I
bring it to me Shona this is my favorite
show that girl moves name was based off
of this and this is my favorite show i
got for christmas and um I just like I
have my computer in here so I'll usually
just bring a show that will keep me you
know yeah occupied on long flights so I
just bringing the whole thing even
though this isn't really a bit you know
portable then I have a sleep mask I
sleep with a sleep mask every night this
is one that just came with like a pair
of pajama pants for FF timeline
like summer party is cute and girly so
yes I always have had this and when I
want to save on the plane I have heads
on um yeah it's just is small you can
fold it up and I need this then I have
five dumb any young really because your
ears pop and I hate that then I have
sunglasses now these on for the plane
because like you don't really I don't
know I usually shut the window thing I
don't need sunglasses but um I don't
want them to get bent or broken when
they throw my suitcase around you know
below the plane so I put them on my
carry-on just cuz you never know so when
you're going to need them so i got this
case from charming charlies and then I
just have this pair of sunglasses that
are like really weird and really floral
and they're kind of late 70s I usually
don't like some of us is that you can
see my eyebrows by thing like has sworn
my eyebrows squish my eyebrows done no
work I always take a scarf with me now I
got this one New York from forever 21
but I just I have a lot of scarves but
this one's just big and nice and comfy
and warm and I always get coal in the
planes so I like to have a nice thing um
like opposed to a blanket I don't want
like carry a huge blanket with me I just
like to have a scarf because this can be
fashionable and cozy at the same time I
have my cord charger for my phone and I
also have my computer charger usually in
here but I didn't want to take it out of
my wall because like behind my bed and
like I didn't want to do all that so yes
I would have my computer charger in here
but obviously I don't have it but this
is just my phone charger I did
glitterize it so yeah then in a little
like these little pockets on side i have
my favorite lip gloss elf super glossy
shiny lip gloss stuff a little perfume
atomizer with this like beauty rush
perfume front my choice tigran just nice
one supposed on the plane I'm sorry and
it don't smell no more then I'll have my
wallet again like I shouldn't carry
versus around but I like to have keep
all my stuff in the wallet this isn't
mandatory that I brand I just put it in
here cuz the last few times I have
brought my wallet cuz it has all of my
crap and money and stuff in here so it's
just heavy duty and nice to bring case I
ever need it and I have a pair of
headphones I like to bring my big beats
because I don't like the little tiny of
your buds when you're in the plane out
to block out all noise like I'm annoying
people babies crying the plane engine
stuff like that and so these are my
beats by dre and the white i got'em for
last year's Christmas like chosen
it's Christmas and they're specially
amazing the block everything out and
they're great like abusing salars
amazing they're nice and easy they'd
bend and then I say you need to take
with you because they bed and they wrap
around the court does what then I just
take um the recent glamour glamour is my
favorite magazine that in 17 and I just
like to carry magazine with me because
I'll you to carry I'll either read a
book or magazine and usually 1 1 planes
I'm kind of just like stressed about the
trimming hoping that everything goes
right in stuff like that and I don't
really want to sit down read a book I
want to like have a light read and leave
through magazine but if I did want to
read a book they have this very heavy
book which is my new Bobby Brown pretty
powerful book it's just so awesome and
like all about makeup I just I really
like it it was fifteen dollars because
it was fifty percent off but usually
it's 30 and the last thing that is in
this ginorm oh jen normal ginormous bag
is my computer in a nice case i got this
one five dollars if you made a pink
purchase from your choice if it says
love tank in black and then just like
floral design on the front and it's very
nice and it's like styrofoam me and
everything I don't know it's like soft
material you open it and it is my
macbook pro which I got in like
September or something and this is just
nice and light and very thin to carry
around with you it works everywhere and
the battery on it is amazing so you can
like use it to watch videos or something
movies listen music whatever you want to
do on the plane and it won't you know
immediately diet it's not charged so yes
that was what I had in my carry-on bag
from a airplane flights and I love
