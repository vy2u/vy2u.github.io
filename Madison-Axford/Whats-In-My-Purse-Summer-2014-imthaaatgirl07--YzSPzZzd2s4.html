tomorrow why did I do this
swag youtubers got support other
youtubers I hey oh so what Wow huh text
what is this background while you may
notice this atrocious background because
I got a new camera I got the Canon t3i
rebel and I'm so happy and amazed that
it's finally mine I I had a Sony for the
first like cheers my channel which was
great grande terrific but it was time
for an upgrade I thought and I can't I
still can't blew that this is mine but
my parents got me this progression thank
you so much mom and dad oh my goodness
gracious huh
but I'm starting a new leaf you should
have drawn my channel which since I
graduated high school I kind of wanna
like upgrade my stuff so I got this
camera a new tripod and I'm getting new
lighting which is being delivered to my
house tomorrow why did I do this I don't
have that today but I really want to
film a video on my camera so instead of
using my same artificial lighting that
I'm using for the past a year I thought
I would just wait and start filming with
artificial lighting with the lights I
mean tomorrow but I need a felt video
today so I'm doing it front of my window
which is like natural light so you know
you get the whole great feeling you know
it's a new camera new lighting new
background this probably won't be my new
background because I don't like this
bookshelf in this closet if you know
what I'm saying it's too busy but I just
think it makes me look a lot more me I'm
not orange for once I don't know if I'll
keep this background but I will keep it
I'm telling you the light switch is
supposed to be tomorrow
yeah Amazon Prime so
without further ado let's get into my
video today which is my what's in my
purse the reason I'm doing this video is
because one I got a new purse but to the
amount of dislikes I got on my last
what's in my purse video with my launch
on play play on bag was crazy it was
disturbing I've never got that many
dislikes on video and I don't know why
so I was just showing you what was in my
purse so anyway I thought I'd do another
one and hopefully this one will be
better and I have my Kate Spade red huge
bag I love it it's literally bigger than
me so it's jam-packed um but it's all
the stuff that I feel like I need or I
just throw it in here and you know
everything eventually it's in my purse
so let's go first thing I see is Trisha
Paytas s new book curvy and loving it
youtubers got to support other youtubers
if you know what I mean but now her
books are amazing this is my second one
that I have of hers and I really love it
I love that she's like raving and I just
think this looks so pretty and it's
really cute and I'm glad that I got this
I bought it my money I didn't can send
it to review it or anything but yeah I
bought it and I'm glad because I ever
loved a message that she's trying to
send and I'm excited to read that more
than I started it but I'm excited to
read more into it the next thing I see
is menstral complete equate which is the
Walmart brand I move my doll because I'm
too poor to actually spend money on my
doll was getting regular mom or grandma
doll that's okay it does the job entity
gum wrapper oh this I went to Sephora
with my sister yesterday and since her
birthday was like oh two weeks ago a
week ago I'm shredder free birthday gift
and she gave it to me
one it but yeah I was laughing the next
thing is a chick-fil-a straw wrapper
Kleenex because I always get a nosebleed
so as we prepared then I've been tanning
a lot recently so I have my banana boat
deep tanning oil no not in a tanning bed
outside natural rays all natural it
literally has an SPF of 4 though so I
don't know if it's really protecting
your luggage but you know it's better
than having that thing on your skin my
coach wallet was just super old what it
just has gift cards in it because I
carry all my main cards in this little
wallet touch my keys but I have some
cash in here oh man alone on cash I
usually never have this much cash and
then I have my actual like little wallet

and I am I feel the need to carry three
pairs in my bag my first ones are cat
eye ones from PacSun and then I have
these ones from Texas to go to my
favorites and then I got these round
ones from love culture that have been a
widget for edge then I have a perfume
this is noir cheese from Victoria's
Secret and I'm just trying to use up a
lot of these on a body mist before I go
to college so that I don't just take one
hundred perfumes with me and I have two
lipsticks and these are my favorite kind
of the Revlon lip butters the first
in the shade sweetheart and the second
one is raspberries hi I love these
they're so moisturizing and they work
well with my weird lips my lips don't
really like a lot of lipsticks but they
like those empty gum pack again this was
Trident layers candy cane disgusting and
I got my iPhone charger because there I
eat this there's not been a day in
history where my phone has not died
before at the end of the day so I always
carry with this with me because wherever
I am I need it then I have a pen my
phone like at the bottom of my purse
