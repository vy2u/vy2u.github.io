crazy but we're just gonna oh dear deal
it still like cute we're just gonna go
with it though because I don't have time
to change the hair anyway today I'm
doing a mushroom ustin what's in my
purse so this is my Michael Kors white
what is this leather not really I don't
know if this is bag um I cut for a while
here's a little medallion give cute cute
and it's a bunch of junk in here I
honestly have not gone through this like
I know people always say they like and
this is like real like I haven't done
through this so it's gonna be trash but
I don't know what's in here
I was like let's just do it you know
there's nothing to hide so we got a lot
of crap to go through so let's get start
it there's two main pockets and then
there's like a zippered pocket so I'll
start with what's his head is ever
pocket I guess without even know okay
it's dig in first I have to service eat
to forever21 for everyone's always like
really jank with their return policy so
I don't know why I kept this cuz you
like can't return to anything really oh
yeah my phone's always in my purse IRA
took it out anyway then I have this is
gonna sound weird but it actually comes
in handy if you know what I mean so I
have to bark bags and this sounds gross
and weird but like seriously I was just
on an airplane and they're nice and
compact and if you or someone else you
know those it goes wrong plug the bag
there you go barf bag ready no holes are
in it you know it'll work
and you know it's not like I'm not just
gonna take up a lot of room like I said
they pulled up and I don't know this is
actually very practical to me at least
so if you think it's gross that's fine
but one time one day when you're sick
you'll wish you had these because I've
gotten sick in a car before when I was
four and I had to throw them to like a
wet wipe container TMI I know but like
that's what we had in the car I was also
fourth so I don't really know the
feeling but now I have these so whenever
I have to throw up if I do have to throw
over someone I just throw up I got you
that's actually that's all it's in the
middle pocket so we're going to start
with one of the compartment first they
have just a pack of extra peppermint gum
it's like half garnish classic Madison
have so much gum another receipt for
Sephora okay I am
have an Ulta receipt two more full packs
of gum and then in some of the side
pockets right here I have a bajillion on
one shout a stain remover wipes that are
very very useful in the company of ten
because I always spill stuff on me all
the time it's inevitable with me and
then in the other pocket I have a brand
new set of headphones that I've yet to
open I always need headphones always I
have I chopped for my contacts um a
lighter this was in my last video I
don't smoke but it you never know when
this will come in handy
and then Advil PM this was like if a
sample I don't take Advil PM I never
have but I don't know I just have maybe
for someone else it was a free sample
from Sam's Club moving on to the next
pocket that's very large and in charge
chunky yet funky Latrice Royale anyone
know what that is now okay first I have
four pens
I collect pens wherever I go really like
Club Wyndham Fairfield Inn &amp;amp; Suites st.
Luke's urgent care and then this is just
a big crystal which I love these pens I
have another packet on have remain cold
outside gum I have a fan I always say
use fans wherever I go because I'm
always very very hot in the
air-conditioning on me I had a green one
that was standing too hard on the flight
down Florida and broke it so I got a new
big one always got my fans I have a
whole bottle of perfume it's Victoria's
Secret true escape body mist so I'm very
good then I have these new sunglasses
that I got from forever 21 I always buy
the cheap sunglasses because oh they're
so dirty what the heck because I break
my senses all the time I will not spend
more than six dollars on sunglasses
here's another pair that I got for free
actually from packs line looks like a
purchased they're kind of cute ish but I
can feel them getting loose around the
hinges and about to break so got a new
parent I have the only medicine that
works for my hair looks go man for my
headaches which is etc not migraine but
cedron headaches and this is just the
CVS brand because or classy like that
you know it's like Tours cheaper so
that's what that was
yeah my friends headphones they pulled
out nicely which I really like they you
know come like this I did a review on
these a while ago on my channel but then
that fold up and you can just throw them
on your person they don't take up much
room I have this side I have funds that
my dad use both times on the planks did
you forgot headphones but they shock
like when they want at earphone works
there tangled mess and like look at this
like this it's bad but I'm just using
them till they totally died so I want to
throw them away yet another receipt for
breakfast I have my car keys which is on
this little it's a key fob this New York
City pink bear keychain and then I do
box oh if you didn't have a peel box
here's the address and my card key a
little fortune from PF Changs that says
don't lose sight of big ambitions I
really like fortunes order they speak to
me I keep them in the bottom of hers at
two lipsticks there are my favorites of
all time
so for pink its Mac angel all day every
day that's what that is like my ninth
tube and then the one I have on right
now is NARS Cruella lipstick that's like
that dries matte one one of my new
favorites so that's that
the last thing I have in here is well
