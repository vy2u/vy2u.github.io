but I thought it was really cute to add
to like Lisa friend Ken Barbie ones and
Mickey Mouse heyo
so today I'm doing a what is in well
actually an updated what is in my
backpack or school bag video um I'm
really excited to do this video because
I did one with McKenzie in the past but
I wanted to do a newer one because it
was my senior year last year of high
school and um I know I'll carry a
backpack in college but I just thought
it'd be fun to do a one last you know
maybe I'll do another one in the spring
but a fall what's in my school bag I
like looking back sometimes saying when
I used to keep my bag and I don't know a
lots changed I think I carry my kind of
new via Radley big tote bag that I got
for my birthday this year which was in
August it's huge it's one of the really
large ones I don't know if it has a
special name or number two whatever this
bag is called and I don't know the print
either I think it's an old one though or
older one because this was like the only
bag that they had in this color and I
love this color goes with everything
black white grey tannish goes with
everything and it's really big it's a
perfect size that I wanted so this bag
rocks they do this exactly what I wanted
um it also carries so much it's not even
funny how much you can fit in this bag
however I've kind of hit the mid of the
middle of the year like senioritis or
whatever it's called where you just it's
so you just find it so hard to try it in
school I'm sucking in aids you know but
I mean my pen smash is gone like my
folder is gone everything is just kind
of thrown in here now and I just really
I care but I'm just like in the point in
my life where I'm just like you know
whatever whatever go with the flow and
everything is just kind of thrown in
here literally just it's everywhere
pretty much I did kind of organize it
today I wasn't planning on doing this
video but I did organize it in one of my
classes because that's what I do so the
first thing I see are just my keys I've
definitely let me put this down when
it's really in my way um I definitely
definitely got rid of a bunch of
keychains I used to create this huge
lanyard with a billion in one key chains
on it now I just have my car key because
that's the obviously most important
thing and why you need to carry your
keys and then I just have this super
cute Hello Kitty lanyard I call it
Lonard but everyone else thought it was
- sorry lienard's Menard it's like
banana I've been on whatever okay
whatever
don't correct me but I say Menard anyway
it's just Hello Kitty and its really
cute red white and blue and has little
sunglasses and HK probably kitty so I
really like it and it's really light now
it's not yeah I love keychains but I
don't need a 110 on my keychain for
school next we just have a buy sprite
it's really light it's my dream more one
from gap that's where I work right now
along with bread Co umm anyway and I
really really really like this smell but
it's really light and I just love how
this smells they do get a discount there
since I worked there I thought I would
pick up one of their perfumes because
I've heard or body splashes sprays
whatever cuz I've heard a lot of good
things about them and I really like this
one it's just nice to keep in my bag in
case you ever like I don't know lose
your scent or you know you need some
perfume we all have those days next
thing I see is my graphing calculator
which I covered in stickers the really
childish but I thought it was really
cute to add little like Lisa Frank and
Barbie ones and Mickey Mouse this
calculator was over $100 but I needed it
for a lot of math classes in the past
few years and I loved it to death I love
a calculator to death sentence shows how
much I really do like this it's better
than just a regular scientific
calculator because it does so much more
and it was I mean I just really really
really really loved this calculator and
I'm thankful that I do have this bring
it back up here it was too far for me to
reach down so it does have like a
bajillion on my pockets in on the inside
um but you know I don't really have
anything really in there I just kind of
have then all my pens and pencils thrown
into one pocket and this is what I have
left from this the beginning I have like
five pegs left
um one eye lighter in two pencils in
this one I don't even know where I got
this it was just again my bag I don't I
didn't get this in the beginning of the
year
so should you how could I go through
things and they run out of anger lead or
I just loose them and place them where
someone bar someone doesn't give them
back people anyway next thing is the
most important thing which is my makeup
pouch and I used to not carry around
makeup at school up within this year I
kind of realize how not important
because it's not important to our makeup
or anything but it was important for me
to just keep these few luxury it's a lot
of things sorry that I do carry in this
pretty big makeup pouch makeup bag that
I did get for my friend Audrey so if
you're watching
Adri love you girl thank you so much for
this I use it every day first in here I
have my new favorite thing ever which is
not new cuz I've had it for a while but
I didn't use it as much and I didn't
really you know get what it was for its
my Urban Decay dumi moisturizing makeup
setting spray and as you can see it's in
the old packaging however I love this
stuff so much and it really hydrates
your skin and gives it that extra glow
and it just makes your skin look so dewy
and nice and not oily or wet or anything
or greasy no I really love this and I
use it tons every day tons every day and
it's still going strong I haven't even
reached the middle of it I don't think
so I really really love this stuff you
should definitely check it out it's in a
new different purple and white packaging
now not like with these leaves on it but
it's partnered with the brand
Scandinavia and I just really really
love this so much so I keep that in
there to refresh my face through the
middle of the day um then I just have my
stippling brush which I used to put on
my foundation I don't bring my
foundation with me just cuz I put enough
on where I don't need to reply it but if
I do get like a crease line around my
nose on my forehead I just like to use
this which may have a little excess
foundation on it to buff it out and just
get rid of any harsh lines or you know
cakiness
where the makeup might have kind of went
together not you know okay it's kind of
hard to explain but like when you leave
your makeup smooth and throughout the
day it kind of creases and you don't
want that so just I just carry a brush
around to get rid of any harsh lines or
anything like that and then I carry
mascara but this one is almost out the
reason I like to carry one that's almost
out it's because sometimes my lashes
since I put so much pressure on they get
clumped together and instead of touching
them and getting it all over my fingers
I like to use the one that's like dried
out because there's nothing on it and
it's a nice separator tool it doesn't
add more mascara but it does separate
them and it makes them look really
really nice and separated and long and
big and looks like you have a lot more
lashes rather than them all something to
get their few yeah in the middle of the
day a lot of stuff happens in my makeup
I didn't need a lot of things to refresh
then I keep an eyeliner this is the
essence long-lasting eye pencil which is
my favorite it's not it's kind of more
waxy it's not a pencil or liquid but it
is a rollup one and I love it
I put it on my waterline and throughout
the day that obviously does come off
also sarai waters and I keep one of my
favorite lipsticks or lip balms which is
just called balm by color riche and
L'Oreal and this is these are my
favorite lipsticks because they don't
give me weird just like clumps of
lipstick or whatever I'm putting on my
lips on my lips it really
bread's it out and keeps me nice and
moisturized while giving an amazing
amazing color I love those and they're
pretty cheap
then I'll keep us a form mirrored
because if I'm doing all this refreshing
to my makeup I obviously you know I'm
gonna have a mirror and then I keep an
eyelash curler in case my eyelashes
deflate and need to pump them back up
again and finally I'll keep a few q-tips
which in here right now I have two in my
new favorite eye makeup remover which is
simple sensitive skin I makeup remover I
know this is kind of big but so is the
do me and it all fits and I'm not gonna
I didn't I don't have like a trial
travel trial size of this so I just keep
the big version and I take it in and out
whenever I need it at home you know or
if I need it at school to get any
underneath my eyes or mascara that might
have gone on the tops of my lid
get back to the bag next I see the
biggest thing which is my notebook I
have kept this I had the folders like
somewhere in my room I just didn't want
to use anymore I have a few loose papers
in the front here but I feel that I
don't have that many classes and I
definitely do not have as many papers as
I thought I would I take a lot of notes
but don't have a lot of like take-home
papers so I just kind of put whatever I
do have in the front there's little
folders in here too I don't really use
them too lazy and I just have this very
very necessary notebook for all of my
classes that I take notes in which is
like every class except one no no every
class every class then I have my oh so
important planner this is a Lilly
Pulitzer planner I'm sad because it was
from 2012 to December 2013 and 2012
obvious Oberon is obviously over in 2013
is almost over - so it said I didn't get
much use out of this because I got it
too late I got on sale I think which is
why like I got during 2013 and 2012 was
already over so I got on silk without
yours are we over and I can't use it for
that long anyway huge long explanation
there but um I really do like this it's
amazing it gives great stickers and it's
just super cute since it is like elixir
I need an agenda to function throughout
the day because without it I just I
wouldn't be able to remember anything I
did or anything that I need to do like
homework wise for the night then I have
my wallet and the reason I carry my
wallet with me I never used to because I
was worried I'd lose money but I do
often go straight from school to work
and I need this just kissing your gas
food something emergency happens you
know you never know when you're gonna
need money it's always nice to carry a
debit card a license you know obviously
I'm
and some extra cash and change with you
for whatever reason you know you just
you always might need money so I do have
that with me it doesn't take up much
room then I have a pair of headphones
and my phone because you got jam or text
someone at the bottom I have a gum
wrapper that you see thrown away and a
few pennies I need to be putting it into
my wallet and I also have a pack of gum
in here I don't know where it went and I
just bought it which kind of worries me
um but I did have in here two seconds
ago I got a piece of gum well not just
seconds ago but like an hour ago anyway
it's probably just somewhere my room or
downstairs you should carry a pack of
gum because it's always nice in case
you're someone's growling or caseous
when i freshen up your breath so that
was a what's in my school bag updated
