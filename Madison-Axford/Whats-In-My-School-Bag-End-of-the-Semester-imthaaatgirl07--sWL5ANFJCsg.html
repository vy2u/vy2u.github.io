everything that I had in my bag at the
current moment so this is the
nitty-gritty what's in my bag at the end
of the semester I just finished my third
semester in college or my half of my
second year I'm a sophomore and yeah
it's great so I'm going to show you
what's in the bag so I have my longshot
Blakely up a long shelf with my gosh
tote bag in this is beige like I don't
it's like the most sturdy color it's my
favorite element and I'm known for being
a person who switches their backpacks or
purses or totes whenever multiple times
throughout the semester in throughout
the year and I kept this the entire year
Gomi I'll show you how 30v inside of the
bag is when I'm done it's really helix
mine I guess throw a lot there's a
pocket right here I don't put anything
in it because everything time for that
everything she goes in the bottom I was
very very excited and I already threw
away my one notebook and we had five
such notebook for my five different
classes subjects that's her excited

trash looks like and then yes oh I don't
have that sure you but I would always
carry on my turquoise five star um five
subject notebook but besides that I will
show you what is in my purse or my
school bag um besides just my notebook I
didn't use full deuce binders journals

notebook to have folders in it anyway

of little like notes in this first part
and then yeah it's just like I write
down my entire life
yes this is my life I have to return
everything or I will forget to do it I'm
not a forgetful person but I need to be
organized and make
all time so that's the first thing it is
in my bag then we just get headphones I
went through like five pairs headphones
this semester because I got some ruffle
things and break them but these are
Apple just like the old kind that came
with like old devices I like them they
work well then I have my little ID pouch

like a branch Kate Spade and I have my
key compartment key on it and so I just
have my ID cash and other cards like a
debit card license and other gift cards
then I have eight pence pouch just white
from a toy secret I think it's a makeup
bag but he said four pence pouch but
it's dirty something you get rid of it
or something and like if this is only
half my pants the restaurant good bottom
but I had tons pens pencils gel pens
mark nut markers yes Jim Carroll had
some gel pens and um it was two men it's
too much like it added too much weight
to this I'm not need to carry 812 pens
next semester I already bought my school
supplies I just got another notebook
because my other one was all used up and
then I got like a six-pack of Sharpie
pens cuz I want to try those cuz this is
just too much so next um I had one these
like squishy fuzzy ball things that I
had on my keychain but it like ripped
off after like a day so I was like f
that um I have a C's sucker wrapper I
love C ski suckers are so good I like
the chocolate cafe latte and
butterscotch I don't like the vanilla
but just let you know and I hate
cinnamon just random facts about me and
I have this little notepad
actually Irish dance shoes on it you can
tell this is vintage my Irish dance but
I got it out of fashion and I just like
wrote down little notes like video ideas
um and stuff like that stuff I needed to
do and get done and if I didn't want to

name with what um band-aids my fingers
always bleed I dropped two flash drives
because I would lose them and then
another ponytail holder and that is my
deck look how dirty this is because you
got all the pen marks it's so sad like I
should taking better care of this and
there's ten marks on the outside but
like you can see that I'm used to a lot
it's been through a lot it was worth the
money I paid for my own I pay for my own
school supplies IV for my own backpack
like favorite my own stuff so if it
breaks and gets ruined it's on me and I
know what else can you mad at me for it
that's why I kind of like having the
ability to buy my own stuff it's really
nice and it's a real accomplishment I'm
not like sour about like I love you know
to buy my own stuff especially if some
does go wrong thing happens it's like
