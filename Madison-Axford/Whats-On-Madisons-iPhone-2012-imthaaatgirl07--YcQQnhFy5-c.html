as much as this one but not make sense
heyo so today I'm doing a very very
requested video it's been my most
requested video ever and it is my what's
on my iPhone video extended am I phone
keys collection which got over a
thousand views which I am psyched so of
course I had to do this for you guys
because you are amazing um so I have an
iphone 4 not 4s and it's just white um
it's about a year and a half two years
old I think I got app for the iphone 4s
came out and the iphone 5 um I have this
case on right now as you know if you've
seen my iphone case collection video i
have like a hundred thousand cases but
this one's from old navy it's just
totally sparkly you can't buy anymore
but i'm sure you can find a hundred
other literary bejeweled dazzled cases
on ebay you just home and turn on it is
456 right now this is a picture of me I
am NOT fram's and I'm in the middle man
this is aaron and that's Michael y'all
work together so yeah this is my home
page so we're gonna slice you unlock mm
has loaded okay so then you go to my
home page and I'm going to zoom in the
video now so that I don't have to keep
like showing your way back here this is
my home page basically we're just gonna
start at the top so first I have safari
calendar photos camera just basic things
you know everyone has them no specific
order just random then we have notes
notepad which actually do use quite
often settings which I was student new
stupid update thing I have to update
don't really like doing that um contacts
and calculator which I use so much oh
gosh then we have this thing which is
just used to check my school grades
which is very helpful then we have
YouTube of course App Store of like 24
app updates whatever iTunes Store
Twitter don't really use it that much
clock i use it for alarm FML it's a
really funny app I don't like post
things but it's just hilarious to look
up and then of course my beloved
Instagram best after you sit down down
here on my main bar we have messages
snapchat I just kind of became recently
obsessed with this phone don't use that
often and of course music so this is my
home
page nothing special about it if you
like this quarter you can do your phone
like this too I'm just kidding but
nothing really special about it to my
normal stuff and then my few of my
favorite apps at the bottom anyway yeah
if you don't know what FML is or
snapchat stop test where you just take
really unattractive pictures of yourself
and send them to your friends and then
FML is just like random posts of where
people have really embarrassing or sucky
moments in their life and they decide to
post them which is hilarious i'm not a
huge app person as you will see on the
next page but i don't really play games
don't want do a love that stuff just
instagram and these view then so doesn't
make sense this is my second and last
page kind of a fail i have four little
categories and then just like three
random things this is newsstand i hate
new Stan so much because I don't use it
I'm not gonna buy a magazine
subscription on my iPhone because I have
it ready in the mail I don't need to buy
them on here that I have facebook I
already space with that much anymore is
kind of like a middle school thing but I
just still have it for you know if
anyone likes that pics or whatever know
me on pandora that's good in case like
you're sticking your music and you're
like I'm gonna find some new music i
found my favorite singer brand the
diamonds on there oh okay so then i'll
do it the four categories look I'm about
first category is photography so you
click on it and you have just four
simple apps i have pinterest it's like
where there's a bunch of DIYs
do-it-yourself things just cool pictures
it cannot find anywhere else then i have
been teak is just to make your pictures
look old scary vintage stuff like that
then i have wallpapers HD it's just a
nice way to find every single wallpaper
you could ever ask for um yeah like
anything you type in they'll have it
take my hands shaky sorry and I'm
instaframe a way to make frames and
photo collages for pictures that you
want to put on Instagram or whatever I
have random 1 i'm definitely not a huge
app person takes a lot for me to buy a
nap because i don't like games that much
preside bejeweled classic game I'd cap
that classic fruit ninja classic ok
Jimbo this is kind of fun it's like
where you have a little okay sorry that
this is really shaky but it's where you
have your little gymnast like you run
and she jumps off a bullet it's really
funny and she falls and you're like put
okay then I have tumble run um it's the
brave edition not the original video
star we make your own videos t-pain your
voice sounds electronic Gangnam style
thing were you like dance like sigh my
favorite game ever red ball this the
only game up late constantly there's red
bull shi click level you see that how we
can see that okay ready I'm playing this
through my camera see if I can get whoa
farts and then you bowl a break somebody
hit something and then the last step is
probably round christmas and this is
originally like 499 but at starbucks a
this free coupon thing so i was like i
got a five dollar app for free and it's
I think it's like the movie the book
something i don't know it's it's really
nice just to have her Christmas toy
random to the not games they're just
little you know utility things and spark
notes from on I don't worry for school
which is never because I always read for
school but I just have it I don't even
know why I thought it'd be useful for
something like Shakespeare poetry then
we have sound how it helps you find a
song um that you don't know I have
flixster four movie theaters or movies I
want to see urban dictionary that's
funny um regular dictionary netflix i

really nice to find funny little cute
pictures the last thing I have is child
utilities it's just all the random crap
that no one uses like who uses a compass

I used to be like obsessed with that
before a garage bank so it's like
require myself singing and would always
be like really bad do we have stocks I
don't know anyone but old people that
use that game center that takes way too
long to set up and I don't put games
