hard part otterbox think so anyway we're
just gonna turn on its 848 and it's a
sunday and my backgrounds just meet in
my friend tony from work we're pretty
crazy but yeah so I knee slide to unlock
in my background for my home screen is
from Pinterest I got it off there's my
own page i reset my phone with a new
year because i love to reset things I'm
like that like my phone my contacts my
music stuff like that
when a new year strikes so they are in
pretty much the normal settings um this
is the only page was different but
because those my apps but then this is
just kind of like the most common with
their phone these are just my text
messages that we have calendar photos in
camera um I used all those lights up for
calendar not really so much whether I
check a lot clock I used for my alarm
every morning maps I've used a lot more
of once I've started driving far the
places on my own videos I don't have any
notes i use a lot for possible youtube
videos and things i need to buy or my
work schedule we have reminders stocks
game center newsstand don't use any of
those um iTunes Store app store dribble
use either those either passbook never
use that ever my life compass never use
that and settings change a lot of things
a lot on my phone so I use that line
which have the four main ones phone
which I barely talk to anyone on the
phone ever mail which I use for my
youtube Safari don't let you said unless
ease for YouTube and then music studios
listo el porto sleep then oh there was a
time I used to picture my thumb's I hit
a happy home I wish you can I heard a go
throw Amy done with that I mainly just
use these for and then like messages in
camera I don't really use it on this
page but it sucks you can't delete them
and I just I eat it but anyway moving on
to the fun second page I don't have that
many apps just cuz I don't like apps I
don't like clutter and I don't really
choose that many on this page first we
have calculator in contact since when i
reset my phone I like place these two in
there a little category together I don't
know they'd like nothing to do with each
other so I don't know why they're there
but they're and then we have voice memos
which I never use facetime which I only
faced I my sister because she you when I
site see me when I look bad except a
battle time
and she's illumine those love to see
that okay what even what medicine oh my
goodness all right then we have an
social which these are the funniest apps
ever they aren't my unfollowing up so if
you and follow me on twitter or on
instagram i will know and i think it's
you know kind of cool to see what
bothers me because i'll either then
unfollow you or I'll be like well or
thought escape its followers plus for
Instagram in the Twitter on Palmers for
Twitter and yeah I like to know who it's
like leading the first time doing group
so um then we have bank of america so i
can check my thing in my name's Kat my
checking account constantly and we have
photography which I use square ready if
you're wondering what I used to edit my
Instagram pictures here we go um if I'm
gonna put one picture and like one white
space around it and you square ready you
can move it anywhere it's so much better
than Wade Graham whitagram whatever you
want to call it I love it so we're ready
definitely great I don't know if they
sell anymore though I'm pretty sure it's
off the app store so we're gonna use
paper look which is a great one I know a
lot of youtubers use this one to put
more than two pictures with white space
around it um you can make collages it's
really nice in case you can't get swear
ready anymore i hope you can this is a
great alternative hey look and then if
you want to add light or any a special
effects i am after light which I think
cost 99 cents and Lumia which cost me 99
cents by things free now I don't know I
like Lou me a better after light has a
lot more like looks and filters that you
can use but Lumia has just been always a
classic for me and I love the lights and
the designs you can put on your picture
so that's how at a man sir Graham
pictures if you're wondering cuz I you
use a lot of white space around on with
every one of my big shirts and I really
love doing that we just have this really
random category which is just social
because it named it that I don't even
know and I just have cameras portal to
check my grades constantly timehop which
is hilarious for checking old twitter
post I'm literally so dramatic and
embarrassing good then we have total
strat move um psych total frat move but
it's for sororities and then i have
facebook which I'd rarely go on ocular
which my sister show me it's how to get
coupons and Pinterest because I'm on
several 90 3 x's pinterest 24-7 then we
have me Instagram um I'm the perfect
girl with pearls if you
didn't know that this is my oh ok goes
by this this is my Instagram I love it
very very much i'm on it constantly and
it posts a lot of pictures see in with a
lot of white space but I post a lot of
pictures because I loved doing that
anyway um I just love Instagram you know
going on here is always super fun I love
Lea people's pictures I've got tons of
like preppy people moving right along we
have twitter which is the grace I've
ever it is my favorite I follow so many
great people and I just love it so this
is my Twitter and I'm the girl 7
underscore and i don't know i love it to
death i tweet so so so so so much so
much 1625 times so far but yeah so it's
really nice to go on there follow me on
both those if you're not already and i
am i snapchat which i don't use that
much at all snapchat Mackenzie or Jeff
or like some of my other friends then I
have Shazam which i used to have sound
had a lot to you know see what songs
were playing if I want you know if
you're in a store and you're like what
song is this and they put up your phone
to like sound the music speak or
whatever and it gets the song for you
and now I switch to Shazam just cuz it
was working better than sound Hamlin's
so yeah sometimes letting me down and I
switched and the last one I have is for
all of us music lovers out there it's
musi X match muziek smash music Smith
what uh and this is a great app if
you're wondering what lyrics are what
the lyrics are two songs because I know
I'm always wanting to rap songs are
moist just when to sing songs in general
and I don't know the lyrics and this
literally shows lyrics Walt songs
playing from your iPod or whatever and
or your phone and it's just really
really great because you can like jam
single opportune you know the lyrics and
all works out in the end so those are my
apps I don't have a lot but literally
all the ones that i do have i use i used
to have flappy birds but i deleted that
because that was not addicting it was
just annoying annoying AF so anyway that
was my what's on my iphone 5 updated
edition i hope you enjoyed that and all
the apps that i had to share some new
some old some you know whatever but
anyway i don't really use a lot of apps
besides that the view that i had
downloaded so yeah that's basically it
and if you're not already take a moment
to subscribe to my channel and become a
fierce and common in diva
