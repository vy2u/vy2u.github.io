requested video ever since I got my Oh a
highly requested video ever since I got
my iPhone 6 again yeah it's a white
silver I said this in my Christmas haul
but my parents decide to give me a
silver one and I'm in love with it I'm
gonna bathe in love with any color but
this one's amazing so I'm gonna do
what's on my iPhone I haven't done one
in a little bit on this channel but
since I got a new iPhone I thought I
would share what's on it so yeah it's
not a plus just a regular at 6 but it's
still huge and I love it so that further
ado let's get started the videos up this
is focus but anyway
you hit that one button we'll do a
little finger scan here is my home
screen so the way the apps work like
when I got the phone I kind of just left
it I haven't really done much with it at
the top left corner we have messages
typical calendar photos camera I don't
have them any photos yet so I just got
this on Christmas weather clock for my
alarm Maps videos notes reminders stocks
gamecenter I honestly don't use any of
that news me and I should store App
Store iBooks health passbook settings
Isla de will use messages and settings
and like that's it and then down here we
have phone and then we have mail Safari
and music love my music that my hands
look so weird they're like anyway
FaceTime is this like when I'm at
college to paste I my mom my sister
calculator podcasts no no I don't use
podcasts extras which they have compass
tips of voice memos in contacts in here
they must know that no one would use
these so they put it in any other whole
couch together cuz no one ever uses
those and numbers what is this numbers
that's it that's give me a headache I
came like that okay I can view no I
movie that'd be extremely hard to work
on a little phone
Pages Keynote GarageBand don't use any
of that I honestly don't then we have my
facebook tab Facebook and messenger I
absolutely hate how you have to have a
messenger now to get Facebook message
like why can't I freaking look at my
messages on facebook why do I have to
download in another app to look at
messages then I have this random tab
which has my Twitter Instagram and
followers
I don't know everything's I'm weird for
having this but I like to know who
unfollowed me like if someone follow me
why am I going to stay
stick around and follow them I have
Instagram and Twitter and the two most
used things on this phone
and this I have a photography app which
just has square ready and pape look that
just adds white border around my
pictures I rarely do that unless a
picture will not fit on Instagram
without me doing that I had time hot
thymeoff is so fun just to see like how
weird I was like a year ago let's see
what I have on here it's the new year
which means it's time to delete a lot of
unwanted people for my context goodbye
like I literally tweeted that like I
think that's funny
and I always close my apps you need to
close your arms so battery anyway I
think it's funny just to look back on
what I tweeted a year ago and what I put
on Facebook a few years ago and stuff
like that then I have YouTube again this
works a lot better than just YouTube on
safari so I downloaded that I missed the
old days when they used to just have
these on phones like remember any chip
was just like on phones now we got all
this like random crap we don't have
YouTube like the most used app by
everyone whatever that means snapchat I
don't use this that much I just find it
kind of weird unless you're like sending
like when you're best friends otherwise
it's just not my favorite thank America
to track my big house which I do quite
often you should too and then games
which is very rare for me I never have
games but since I got a new phone I
thought I'd add some new games I've I
sick old which is like this little like
stupid like game you can look it up it's
really stupid as hard to explain you
just like try to drive this little guy
over top bicycles and then sing by small
oh my god this the funnest game ever
like you literally sing with some other
person it's a you do it all these pop
songs like let me literally show you one
like I don't know I think this game is
so fun I will literally spit I spent
four hours yesterday just singing on
this like it's so fun oh my god you
don't even know so definitely check the
staff you love to sing I did the song I
love you a love I was like and it's
follow the way you're not selling it out
Parent Trap I did that yesterday this
girl oh here we go this is hurt here I
can't ready
anyway
I just love that it's so fun just goof
around with random people you don't know
across the world and anyway yeah so that
was everything that's on my phone my
backgrounds just one that it came with
pre-downloaded I hope you'll enjoyed
this video it was highly requested
subscribe if you're not already and epic
later for new videos I post new videos

the universe doesn't give you the people
you want in your life
it gives you the people you need to help
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
