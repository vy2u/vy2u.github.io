bad where I am at but that'd be fun to
film in this chair for today's video
today I am doing a boom what's in my
back pack and it's what's really my
school backpack I know people do this
and just have folders and notebooks and
stuff like that this is literally what
is in my backpack I just coming from
school so I thought I would show you
what's in it for the past like a few
months because we got back in January
you just fool and it's not March so I
thought I would show you what is in my
bag for real because I don't want to be
asked this I want to show you what real
life is like anyway this is just a Swiss
gear backpack I'm used it for the whole
year
I got it in August before we start
school and it's been heavy-duty and good
to me all this year so far so anyway
this is what it looks like it's very
plain but I liked it and so this front
pocket we're just gonna dive right in
well first outside I water well okay
it's getting hydrated it's a must
anyway first starting in this pocket I
don't know how I put it like this I have
another water bottle no no I those there
and we'll finish those don't worry okay
these sweets are my way anyway okay is
my phone phone is a must for music
texting when you're bored Lola it's just
nice to have this so I have my phone
with me at all times
I have some flashcards for class Kleenex
an empty pack of gum and other Kleenex
a bent note card I told you this is real
Kleenex gum wrapper Kleenex
I wasn't even sick I just always have to
carry Lexi Nexus with me what my nose
runs when it's a clap sight or it goes
with the laptop that's why I have the
hose MD gum wrapper trash tissues again
for bloody nose and umbrella is a must
it's disgusting okay oh just because
when it rains you know especially in
Missouri it's so bipolar the weather so
it's just nice to have this to beat
myself a drive oh gosh I have feminine
products I have a bunch of pens and
pencils dunno a pencil pouch I don't
know why these and ended up in the front
pocket I have my Menard which should
have made room TV my ID and pepper spray
on it headphones this is like on meds
more pens lip gloss perfume
it's not so good it's like the oaths and
sexy went for a secret little chapel
sighs I love it and then just a bunch of
trash and gone records and receipts and
I need to clean this out I'm chewing the
big compartment of the bag I have this
huge from artifact here that I don't use
anything in I just feel like I put most
of the stuff in this middle compartment
and I stuck back here it gets washed it
should be easy for me to put it in one
 it and not have to look through
every superpower I'm looking for okay so
in this video game I have first a
textbook it's the textbook for my music
fundamentals class music section really
really hard then I have a sociology
notebook I had this class today in to
take little notes
but yeah I just have the class my
friends I know it over to in morning
India good to go I have my pencil pouch
which I should put these pencils in into
Latin and Jasmine makeup pouch from
Walgreens I think it's adorable I just
picked this up on a whim and I was like
do I need this no but I'm gonna buy it
it has a bunch of stuff in here one
thing I suggest throwing in for college
is definitely a pencil sharpener
but remember two pencils before tests
and stuff like that and definitely a a
stapler yes I already mention that in
other videos but if there is it's a must
so that's just like a huge cut the pouch
of cute I have my Lilly Pulitzer planner
been with me since day one
I write the stove mushed up in it it's I
write so much stuff in it it's my life I
just like a like calms me down and keeps
me organized and like my mind is I don't
lose it kept ahead everything went down
and I'm good I have more pens and
highlighters at the bottom of my bag I'm
stolen organize see this is why it's
like the real nitty gritty stuff it's
not just like oh this is my pretty tag
it's like this is I'm not an organized
and then I have this iclicker thing
which we use to get like extra points
during class we answer questions my
computer which is a MacBook Pro Retina
18 inch you're wondering and I have this
eye benders Benzer I've ends our case on
it it's really cute it's like a
turquoise car it's dirty we need to
clean it I love it I ordered it off
Amazon for like 20 bucks so definitely
check Amazon not sponsored but check
them before you check other places
because they're usually cheaper and that
is all I am in this big pouch and in my
backpack in total so hope you enjoy this
