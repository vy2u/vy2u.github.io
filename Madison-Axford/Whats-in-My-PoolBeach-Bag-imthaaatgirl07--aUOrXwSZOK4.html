I'm doing the what's in my pool or beach
bag and I love this video on watching
these videos even though they're kind of
all similar you bring sunscreen and
water and stuff like that but i just
want to show you the particular things
that i bring maybe they're different
maybe they're different brand just kind
of stuff like that and it's really fun
an inch stinks since it is the summer
season so let's get right in with the
video the first thing is obvious I
usually carry it not in my bag was just
like out in my hand and it's just a
beached hell this one's just multi color
I don't know I think it's like from
target it's really long which is nice to
it covers the entire beach chair if
you're going to like a public pool and
you don't really want to lay on those
chairs um it's nice to just like light
on your own towel so I just I'm flowing
like this and carry like this along with
my bag and obviously you have to bring
this to dry off to lay out on and I just
really really always have to have a
beached out it's like a no-brainer so
next we'll go with my bag it's actually
kind of heavy but I don't have that much
stuff in it I try not to over pack for
the beach or the pool because a lot of
times we'll be in the water and I don't
lay out that much but if I do I kind of
want and need these things so first I
just have a water you don't always have
to have this brand or anything but it's
a super-large smart water and it's just
good to have this nice you know fresh
and cold in a super-large selassie the
whole beach or pool day you have to stay
hydrated it's like a necessity and I
just want to get out of the first or
doesn't get make everything in my bag
wet but this is just a must you have to
bring water um even over like soda you
know red bowler fruit punch whatever you
gotta bring tea I don't know you always
need water also because I mean the main
component of our body somebody needed
next I have my sunglasses I just got
these and they're beautiful they're
circle lenses or circle sunglasses and
look at the sides oh look at this
detailing I just love it love it love it
they look magnificent on like look at
this I love the circle lenses and then
like if you have your hair bag you can
see the sides and the detailing their
from this Snooki sunglass lines so yes
give Jeff sunglasses because those
phrase can be harsh on your eyeballs
next I have sunscreen you want to get
burnt or anything like that
so this is just so I neutrogena and you
can even put it on wet skin which is
nice in this SPF 50 which I don't need
super strong SPF but I like to have more
than 30 even though some people think is
controversial and doesn't really work if
it's over 20 or 30 but I just like to
kid uh you know big enough amount and I
just really like this because if you get
out of the pool and you want to reapply
it off to wait until you dry off and
they get more Burke you for the Sun dry
or wet sand and I just loved into Gina
brand for my skin and stuffs always
really gentle and nice on it since my
skin is sensitive so it's kind of tiny
bottle but i prefer spray 100 to 1 /
lotion and then i also have an SDF lip
thing we're like moisturizer or whatever
and it's just the pink baby lips it's
the number 25 pink punch I just like to
have this in my lips turmoil a don't get
dried out by the Sun they don't get
burnt or chapped and I have headphones
these are just my iphone 5 ones um they
work amazingly they're like oh my god
they're like beats your phones are like
so so good and they I think they're like
20 x dollars or something in the store
1950 or $25 i can't remember i was
looking at some stuff in the apple store
and this was one of them and i don't
remember what the price was but these
came with my iphone 5 so i was lucky
enough you know to get them for free
occasion not in them um but i loved like
volume change around the headphone and
they're just nice and long and they work
amazingly along with my iphone 5 which
of course i bring your phone and keep an
emergency or just a text instagram cool
beach pool pictures or listen to your
jams you know and this is just a nice
cute summary phone case that i got for
twenty-five dollars or 2450 from
victoria secret pink and i have my
wallet this isn't a necessary thing
because you could just bring a little
cash thing but the only reason i do
bring it is because of my license my
credit card and my money cuz i'm gonna
get a you know same to eat or or locker
a snack or whatever but I just have this
just in case I'm Mountain about after
the pool where before the pool or at the
pool and I need any of this change your
cash you can find blast things in my
beach bag are reading materials and
these are the things that I've been
doing recently when I go to the pool I
don't have a beach from where I live but
if I went to the beach I bring them also
and it's just a magazine this is a thin
one which I like I don't really read
that much of the songs I get hot and I
prefer to either get in the water I
listen to my music on my phone but this
is just self magazine with Ke$ha on the
front and so I'll just read this I
prefer um if I do if I am gonna raid if
I am going to read I'll definitely read
magazines / books
I can't really concentrate the Sun I'm
just like month so self magazine and
then I also brought these when I went to
the pool if you saw my vlog if you saw
my vlog I brought these to the pool but
you didn't really belong to the pool but
anyway it's just Trisha Paytas his new
book this day my insanity it's really
thin also and if its cold your day at
the pool where I can concentrate more
and not be sweating my butt off then
I'll read so that's all I have in my
little beach bag of enjoyed this video
is really fun to do to show you what I
prefer to bring and you probably bring
to say things but i don't know i just
want to show you what I bring so thank
you so much for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
