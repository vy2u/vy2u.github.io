my purse video and I'm really excited
because I originally did one of these
and I put it up on my youtube channel if
you've been with me from the beginning
and you remember that um but I took it
down because like I said in that when I
had had that purse for almost two years
and I felt like I wasn't really showing
you like new stuff like I read it but I
just wasn't happy with it and like it
was kind of personal on she's like
either I don't like this video and if I
don't like a video of mine I'm gonna
take a channel because that if I send a
hundred percent that I'm happy with it
and I'm proud of what I put up then I'm
not gonna have it be up on my YouTube
channel and so I was like I really don't
like this I've had this for two years
just a bunch of crap and trashing it no
I'm redoing it so I got this purse
recently and it is from Windsor and I
just love it it's black has these two
small straps and then a large shoulder
strap if you want to carry out a
crossbody and it just has these
beautiful studs Steve Madden like almost
um on the front of the bag and on the
sides and then on the back is just
playing with one little small zipper and
this was around $40 I'm very happy with
it that's great quality and I can tell
it's me the last because I just I am but
I love it and I'm just super happy that
I bought this durable purse so let's get
started so first we go to the back and
has this nice compartment with a zipper
so you open it I'd only have one thing
in here and it's the most important
thing my phone yes this is my iPhone for
white and I just need it to be in a
separate pocket because I need it fast
quick I need to find it yes I just have
this and it's in that pocket alone like
I feel like nothing else is that
important that I need to put it in there
with my phone so then we go into the
large compartment and it is separated by
this little like side divider so there's
two different like compartments you can
put stuff in and cut the zippers and
pocket on the sides I prefer to not put
anything in pockets or like zippers I
don't know I don't like doing that I
feel like I'm not gonna keep it
organized just going to put everything
in you know on either side so and also I
don't like have specifics I for one
thing or the other sides for another
like everything just goes on whatever
side it can fit it that will start out
on one side and first I have my coche
wallet you saw this in the other what's
in my purse video if you did watch that
one if you didn't great you know
whatever
tons and tons of cards in here um that's
not a lot has changed if you saw my last
video I just have a letter received in
this first pocket so yeah let's see we
got Target Walgreens Target Red Robin
huh and then I'll start my gift cards so
I have Target Best Buy Kohl's
um Charlotte Russe at the mighty works
charming Charlie's I mean Charlie's Best
Buy Barnes and Noble and Ulta yeah those
are all my cards and it's nice to have a
lot of gift cards because then you feel
like you're not spending money you know
you have like I'll just get friends here
like yeah I didn't buy anything today
huh so down here I just I'm trying to
cover up on my personal information
seriously what I have down here I have
my Erie and American Eagle rewards cards
um my also rewards cards Sephora
Walgreens Red Robin I have my debit card
my license my school ID and my library
card and I also have some coupons in
this pocket
um because I am a coupon girl and I like
to save money that was my wallet I just
wanted to go through it briefly and I
could you like hole what's my wallet
thing I just kind of want to explain
what I had I also have some change in
here yeah the usual so yes this is my
wallet next in my bag we got sunglasses
this is a nice like zebra pink and black
case from charming Charlie's and inside
I just have these really like nerdy
glasses they look like they're from the
70s but I think they're really cute they
were super cheap and I got them from
forever 21 if you never know when it's
gonna be sunny any of you so you're not
blinded when you're driving or walking
um I have an eyeliner this is my
favorite one by Lancome you can see on
my everyday makeup routine and this just
works wonders I think it's better than
the Urban Decay 24/7 because I'm not a
huge fan of that eyeliner even though
tons people are and yeah I just carry
this around with me and I also use it
everyday so it goes in and out of my
purse all the time because it's the best
one and it's so long and like this is me
sharpening a lot so it's really been an
awesome so they have a pen it's just
Wrigley's Extra gum my mom got it but
it's just as nice grip and I really like
this pen you know you always need to
carry a pen around but I have a band-aid
this is just Johnson
and a dance the Winnie the Pooh kind I
love the field and it's so cute
but I just I'm always having paper cats
at blisters especially both sir
someone's breaking in shoes um and yeah
and you just you never know when you're
gonna need a band-aid or maybe someone
else you Whitney's one yeah you need to
hurry bad days then I have a mirror this
was also in my last what's my first
video it's a pink be jeweled flower and
it's just a compact mirror where one
like oh it's some dirty excuse that on
this side is regular on the sides like
times five zoom in or something yeah I
have a mirror make sure you don't have
food in your teeth I always have like an
eyeliner smudged on me and I'm like what
the heck oh then I got another band-aid
gotta have more than one same way to put
one then I have my beats I used to carry
around little earbuds um any superior on
two pairs but now I just carry one one
shouldn't turn these around because
they're like you know they make it
smashed or broken and they're really big
but I love them and they're easy to wrap
up yeah just take these wherever I go if
I'm traveling they'll be in my tote bag
or my purse and I just love these are so
amazing but they are expensive so we've
done with the first compartment but now
we just no go to the next one first I
have my name tag from work it's my name
tag so this is my interest as Madison
obviously I think I did a pretty good
job on it I'm so nervous I'm gonna get
one and then they laminate it so I was
like huh please a mess up and yeah I
think any good jobs you always need to
have your name tag with you and I have
some receipts the usual by central Wet
Seal I buy too much medicine and I have
my favorite five gum it's cool ball the
blue one I was gone but I got my gum I
go through so much gum it's bad but I
love them I have my gloves um these are
my neon yellow and black touchscreen
gloves a gum from Target for three
dollars I think you have a touchscreen
on the thumb and put your finger and
they work amazing and they were super
cheap and I need a pair of these and
these were so affordable so I was like
holla
then I just have a ponytail holder and
it's just pink and stretchy it seems
like it's kind of gonna like kind of get
a break so I need a new one of these
oh then I have two more pens these my
favorite kind of hens they're the paper
made gel and and they just write so
amazingly and smooth
and I just have a blue and green one
these are the actual cars Bank they're
blue and green which I love colorful ink
pens oh my god really done we're almost
done like what the heck oh another
receipt to Windsor huh yes I also I
think that was my purse or see they're
just like put it in the purse I love
changing purses this seems like enough
so I'll be like in the mall and be like
changing my prism yeah I have my perfume
atomizer this thing works amazing it's
nice to just you know if your perfume
goes away and you're like I need a
spritz then you got this thing it's in
the color aquamarine I love it I got for
Christmas from my sister and I have my
favorite lip gloss of all time Elsa
super glossy lip shine this is like a
hundred my videos I love it it's like on
my lips right now it's not sticky which
is great because I hate one pair of
6-tier lip gloss and it gives off a nice
red tint it's not too bright never said
I didn't like okay I just have my same
brush it's blue it has little stars
silver it's kind of gross excuse that
well cut it but you always need a brush
because I always have knots so lastly I
have my keys from my car and it says my
full name on the Lonard that they're all
hanging on so I'm trying to cover that
up so first I just have on my Lonard
this Native American pin but I have a
Tinkerbell pin because I like Peter Pan
and stuff like that so those are just
nice to pin under Lonard so I'll just
briefly go through some of the key
chains I had this nice little um this
was in my purse before but I put it on
my keys this time I want to turn on oh I
have a little light and I'm just in case
I meant leaving work in the dark or
something like that
