race
assessment

Oh

yeah
just yeah so today I'm doing a really
really exciting video that I haven't
done since this summer it's like kind of
like a video that you do over and over
again because it's up what's in my purse
2014 edition I love love love these
videos so so so much they're very fun to
watch and it's funny like um the way I'm
gonna do it today it's where I have not
seen this out literally this is what I
carry my purpose it's not unofficially
what I carry in my purse
oh yeah I carry wallet and lip gloss
yeah
it's literally you see everything like
this is not organized there's trash
everywhere probably it's a mess but I
thought to show you like that because
it's kind of funny that way and it
really does show you what's my purse how
I carry my purse I'm one of the most
organized people you'll meet but I
cannot seem to for the life of you to
keep my purse organized anyway the
person I'm doing this video on is my big
beautiful long jump lake fiash small bag
it's a small the small one it may be the
best color ever the Navy is quickly
become my favorite color and my long
shop literally is my most treasured item
that I don't like literally nothing that
I own compares to the way I feel about
my long shop I love it so much about
familiar today to 2013 when I turned 17
and I just loved it to death
I haven't monogrammed it or anything I
don't know if I went to it's just so
beautiful but I'm just a screaming noise
I hear so further ado let's get into
this video so you just unsnap because
there's no pockets on like the outside
and then also has a zipper which is
really nice double protection and some
Lewis people and you don't want in your
purse just saying oh okay well it I told
you it was messy literally I can find
everything that I would ever need in
here you know it's not a guy trouble
finding stuff it's just I don't care
about organizing it anyway we're just
gonna hop right in no particular order
I'm just grabbing the first thing and I
see which happens to be a fork yeah like
from chick-fil-a I think was yes cuz I
went there with Mackenzie my friend last
night and
Center and I grabbed a bunch of these to
put my purse because you always I don't
know I got I got most on the road and I
always need silverware but I don't have
it so I just grabbed some some a couple
forks since I have one in my purse and
wanted my backpack I know I sound really
weird but I know it'll come in handy one
day just you wait
the actual thing I see is a receipt for
Venera okay I got half of the Napa home
and chicken salad sandwich if you care
um and chips so that school will be well
beans and I could have so much because
that's look literally all I can eat

good the tune felt really good there I

giveaway nothing these ones but at every
pair oh yeah sorry I have a baby on my
hand okay sorry sorry

too like because I step on them and
break them drop them throw them Chuck

little wristlet from Kate Spade I got
for Christmas so that's the end of my
what's in my purse nothing else will
come out the thing I love about the long
shop small bag is that it's it fits so
much as shown there um and it does have
a pocket on the inside I obviously don't
use it as Superman messiness and
disorganized self but um alright what I
love about this is that you can pinch
all much stuff in it literally so much
stuff and doesn't look bulky or
disturbing and still um it's like easy
to find you can like see the bottom at
all times it's not that like tall but
you still find everything and fit
everything I love this bag so much I
might not be the most organized person
but I love my purses to death and I can
always find everything that's not a
problem in fact like couldn't find stuff
I wouldn't be but you know I like to
organize my purse I do it quite often
but then she comes messy and so it's
like what is the point anyway I hope you
