Q&amp;amp;A I love doing Kunis as you all know
it's my first one in 2016 which is quite
exciting I'm not gonna ramble too much
because you know how q and A's work
asked you guys leave me questions on an
Instagram picture I posted yesterday and
I was gonna wait a little longer to get
more questions but I got six hundred
plus in the first day so I was like okay
I think we have enough questions thank
you so much if you left a question it
means a lot because I used to start out
with doing Q&amp;amp;A is getting like ten and
that was amazing that ten people cared
to ask me and something in learn more
about me and now over 600 anyway I'm
super excited this video I'm that
further ado let's get started okay so
the first question I have is how old
were you when you started on YouTube I
was 16 favorite Disney World ride well
that's a cool question um I'd have to
say it's in Magic Kingdom Walter Stosch
like three like Space Mountain a splash
mountain and Big Thunder Mountain like
the mountains and the mountain rise and
I love those those the most fun to me
because there's just scary enough but
not like nauseating
I don't like crazy upside down ride I
like I've never ridden rock'n roller
coaster or Howard Harrow those are not
my thing
yeah the three Magic Kingdom mountain
ride okay there was question a lot do
you live at home or do you live at
college I live at college but I came
home off into film because filming takes
up so much space with a tripod and
lights in the background all this stuff
that I can't physically fit in my
apartment Oh at my college so I live in
college but I come home often to film
for you guys so yeah that's why you see
me in both places quite often what was
your first date and did you kiss um no I
didn't kiss him I was 16 I think it goes
better in 17 and we went to shoot where
did we go I think I went to Taco Bell it
didn't work out have you ever had a
boyfriend yes I had when are you going
to see Jeff again I'm going to see Jeff
August 2017 so in about a little awesome
two years what is your biggest pet feat
pet peeve pet peeve um oh I know this
one
when people ask me to follow them oh my
god okay when people ask me and
constantly comment on my pictures on
Instagram or tweet me on Twitter to
follow them there's nothing we want to
follow you like I'm sorry it's just so
rude like oh I'm sorry but I can't
follow everyone and it's just like you
really use my nerve some people like
follow me
oh no when people come at first on my
pictures of my videos first comment
second comment first watch Percy you
first like stop if you could be any
Disney Princess which one would you be
Belle she's my favorite because she's so
pretty and cute and I like her and I
don't relate to her I'm not like quiet a
book worm but I don't know I love her
have you ever had person every spell
kept of it when people ask me this
because I have a huge s gap but yes I
did a braces for two and a half years um
it was to fix this gap right here and I
didn't have a gap in between my two
front teeth before braces but after I
since I stopped wearing my retainer if
not like a belt and one this metal is
like the permanent but I stopped wearing
my plastic retainer
because I just couldn't anymore I didn't
want to and um yeah so then all my new
gaps formed and I love them so if you
don't like them I'm sorry but I love my
teeth I got this question a lot and it's
what's your favorite Kardashian my
favorite Kardashian is Chloe it always
has been
he's just most like cool a badass one
and she doesn't really give a crap like
the other ones are too I don't know
there's something about all of them that
are like two Chloe's a little different
when was your first makeup session and
how was it um yeah I was 17 and that's
all we're gonna say about that is your
anxiety hard to deal with um yeah and
sometimes it is and I try to keep it
hidden so not a lot of people know that
I have it because I mean I'm not gonna
be like I mess and I'm anxiety this on
the first thing you should know about me
or I shouldn't want people to know about
me like it's hard to deal with it is
because you're living with it constantly
every day it's not something you get
better from that quick and it's not
something that you can just avoid or
erase it's always gonna be there and so
it's like you have to
to deal with otherwise your life's gonna
be miserable so I have learned how you
hide it for the most part but it is hard
sometimes it is and it's hard because no
one understands that's what makes it
harder
it's good you feel like everyone's kind
of annoyed with you and mad at you and
you're like oh I just wish you could
understand how I feel but no one really
does want to deal with it if you're
dating a guy who is loud and kind of
annoying but sweet to you what do you do
be louder and more annoying what is your
favorite slang word to use what we're
doing use the most
I also that's question a lot what are
you majoring in I'm a communication
major it took a long time to get there
and finally plant myself in something
that I knew I was like and be happy with
and succeeded and hopefully be a
reliable career because I was in musical
theater for so long and I was like I'm
not good enough to actually ever do
anything with this so let's pick science
more realistic medicine I'm a ninja
kamyelle to give up something I love so
much but I like this just much it has to
do with YouTube's which media in PR and
videos and stuff like that so I'm very
happy with where I'm at right now how
many kids do you want
what were their injuries be and also
what was your name them okay I've
answered this in a lot of videos of mine
before but I would love to - three um I
just not like kids it always be like bye
but I don't know getting older now and
I'm like not anytime soon oh my god like
maybe ten years but no nighttime soon I
would love to two or three I don't care
what the genders are that that's not
important you love um any gender you get
whether it's boy girl or transgender you
know if they choose to do that um so I'm
just excited to have like little Me's
and so I would name them Charles and
Bianca for sure there's my top two names
and then the third one um I guess my
husband get yourself are you Norwegian
because if so we're Norwegian do you
assist us
yes I am I'm a mainly Norwegian um
bigger this one or ET the sisters what
did your most use emoji this the kissy
lips oh my god is in every single text
message basically like I could be like
I'm gonna go eat mac and cheese and I'll
put that kissy face it don't matter
it'll be there do you usually read the
comments in your post because there's a
lot oh my friend love yes ah yes I do
I typically read them there's not I
can't
because I'm not going to have 70,000
people in one post I'm not gonna post
any sometimes I do see your comments and
they're extremely nice on YouTube and on
Instagram I will read through them like
spend you know a now a good hour of a
day reading through comments just to get
feedback and see if people are liking or
not when I'm doing if you could be any
type of chicken nugget what kind you be
I'd be a dinosaur nugget Mackenzie knows
what I'm talking about
will is intense or not good what is your
Kochi foundation currently right now
it's the Revlon foundation stick I never
liked stick foundation because on my
foundation foundation condition needs to
be liquid and I'm like this stick is
everything yes what do you do if you're
not sure if a boy likes you you ask them
hang out it says yes see what things go
from there it says no move on this I'm
coming here I'm going to be a freshman
high school
anything I need to know about classes
teachings of drama there's gonna be a
lot more classes and a lot more fun
things you can choose to do it's not
just your typical middle school like
five core classes this you get to be
more of an individual friends yeah
there's probably still can be a lot of
drama there's tons of drama and middle
school in high school college no drama
no no I guess you should know you but a
high school though still be a lot of
Cadi drama
you shouldn't have certain number
friends okay it should be based on
quality not quantity like doesn't matter
if you have one or 100 orphans
everything one person the grade or one
other person like it doesn't matter I
had to literally like two friends it
likes me it supported me I felt like at
least at the time and I was fine it's
not about quantity of friends it's about
quality because if they're good and
you're your best friends you don't need
that many Hey
oh the picture you posted with Abby Lee
Miller we on Dance Moms
yes I was actually on the first season
Club um no it's on Dance Moms
I met Abby Lee at this meet and greet
and my town and everyone thought I was
like photoshopped picture and I'm like
no I met her she said this shot my
makeup and I was just like that's what I
made you do I mention your makeup so
yeah what videos you have the most fun
of inking I am the most fun making
videos where I just talk to you guys cuz
I feel like I don't know I'm not like
dinner with friends or something I'm
like hey guys something about my life um
I'm table videos I hate our fake-ass
acting videos oh sorry she need a second
okay I respect every kind videos that
each of us do because they're putting in
their own right creative like said okay
I get it I get it I get it
something for I hate talking videos
whatever but I cannot stand watching
first of all DIYs I thought it should
enemies
second of all it's most expectations
reality I know the share of me so yeah I
won't on watch those have I ever seen
the show friends girl are you new here
hold up now class what do we think the
answer to this question is I think yes
would you prefer to be smarter happy
that's a tough one because happy like
happiness is kind of like oblivion and
when you're smart you think about things
too much and oftentimes the bad things
the cons the negative side of things so
I feel like I'd probably rather be happy
why do you call yourself a fears in
heaven and diva girl also new here fears
company but does not mean a stuck-up
bitch I think she's better than everyone
else because everyone parently thinks
that's what it means
no a fierce and competent diva means
that you have gone through some
you've come out on top you might have
not used to love yourself you might have
got bullied you might have been really
self-conscious or not confident at all
the fierce cognitive amines that your
fierce within yourself you know who you
are you love yourself and you're proud
to be you confident means you don't let
anyone's words tear you down because you
believe in yourself and a diva is not a
bitch a diva is someone who's powerful
independent
and dependent on those shelves and
that's it
so we enjoyed this video your on
reaching home to subscribe to my channel
become a fierce come in and do more like
me and the rest of us on here and share
affiliate for new videos post new videos
every week
