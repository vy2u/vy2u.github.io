calling YouTube made me buy it which I
think they loved them before but I'm
gonna create my own version of it it's
all the products that really YouTube
introduced me to I don't think I would
have known a lot of these makeup
products if it wasn't for people kind of
like raving reviewing etc using whatever
then because a lot of them are you know
huge brands but some of these products
might not be the most famous things if
it weren't for you two I really do feel
that YouTube has brought these to light
and put them in front of people's faces
and so people will go out and buy them
and that's the reason I have all these
products that I do is because I you know
watch reviews on them or watch people
use them and then when I don't get them
and I'm gonna tell you the true opinion
of mine on each product I'm not gonna be
asset to a brand likes me I'm gonna tell
you whether or not it's worth the money
because some of these are very high-end
Sephora or you know exclusive prestige
brands and I don't want to steer you
wrong if you're saving up money and I
don't want to tell you that the product
is great it's not like 100% the best
product ever so I have quite a few
products oh my god because I wanted to
include almost everything I could think
of or find within my own makeup
collection that I would include because
they're all from YouTube so um yeah no
specific order where there's a lot of
products from other brands drugstore in
a tank and the further ado let's get
started the first thing I have here is a
why assault lipstick this is in the
shade sheer candy I think so it's a
metallic lipstick with the gold YSL logo
around it and it is a red shade wasn't
swatch it for you this is what it looks
like it is very very sheer compared to
what you think this will look like when
looking at the stick I do like it it's
very buildable but its sheer it's not
sticky or anything it's more of a
lipstick than anything now lip gloss but
um I do like this I'll have all the
prices for these things right here so
you know it was expensive considering it
is why I sell so it's the name brand but
I don't know if I would buy it again
especially in this color or this
particular line I'm sure this utter
other why is the lipsticks that are
better and other
and company lipsticks that are better
like I do like this but I feel I got to
put on layer after layer after layer
because it's constantly wiping off and
there's not much there because it is so
sheer and just like rubbing your lips
together it like fades away through like
a light like pink almost it's not a red
or a rich red which I thought I was
getting when I think this up so I should
have tried at the store but I did it my
mistake I do like it I do use it but I
would never purchase it the next part I
have is a drugstore foundation it's the
l'oreal infallible i use many a tube of
these and when it first came out and i
think that this is an amazing foundation
especially for darker skin tones because
even the lightest shades when they
oxidize turn very very orange and that's
something i'm is a turn-off for me
within foundations i'm using a stick
foundation right now by Rimmel
absolutely adore it because it doesn't
oxidize this more of a clay base this
like it covers like amazing like am
Amazonian clay by Tarte foundation
that's super thick and super high
coverage and so is this it is very thick
I'll show you a little but it just is
very dark like this was one of the
lighter shades one of three and I don't
know there's just talking about it that
makes it oxidize almost like an orange
or a tan so I got the coverage is
beautiful but I was finding that you can
see exactly where the line would stop or
if there's a space on my face a space on
my face that I missed during application
you could blatantly see it throughout
the day because of the oxidization color
that happens once it air dries so I like
it I don't think I will be repurchasing
it because I found other foundations
that don't do that um and and you know
that this is a tried-and-true one of
mine because I used it for so long and
that end in a lot of dysphoria 'ls but I
don't think I was realizing the color
especially on my neck that it was a
leaving um like residue wise so it's a
good good product especially if you have
darker skin tones check this out but for
us Bailey's we should not really choose
this I don't know that the best one for
us out there in the drugstore
next I have Kat Von D's Lolita lipstick
this is a bit a bitch of a me I don't
know shocked surprised or shocked maybe
I bought this it was out of stock in my
store forever
my sport store so I had to get it
offline and I'm not a huge fan I know
that's like such a shocker but like it's
a beautiful color beautiful beautiful
like taupey brown mob love it but then
the color payoff was not the best it
would really chipper on my mouth and I
think I might have been the way I put it
on but the application of this is just
like a regular cheap little sponge tip
and it didn't give me like a nice line
like it was hard to apply this since it
is a liquid I usually like my brushes to
be like the duck feet ones or like the
one that they get concealer brush like
long ones so I can get like the point
and outline my lips if I'm not gonna use
a liner now this you like had use a
liner because it's such a chunky brush
that is hard to evenly line your lips
and apply this so um I love Kat Von D's
makeup Lian I do but this product maybe
it's just this color wasn't working for
me also I am pale so this dark of a
lipstick looks a little heavy but that
particular color on me my opinion was
not good I feel like every time I buy a
pack from YouTube it like doesn't work
like I don't know maybe it's just me
next I have one of the great ones Mac
prep in crime fix plus you can use this
as a priming spray before you apply
makeup or foundation or whatever my nose
itches but I use this as an eyeshadow
glue really like especially sparkly
pigments or really any eyeshadow to make
it more creamy and just glue onto your
eye and be that much more in-your-face
and sparkly or that much more pigmented
this is great because it just picks up
so much more of the products on a brush
I'll show you real quick what I mean by
that so I have silicate and eye shadow
right here and this is an amazing eye
shadow on its own as you can see there
that's one swatch I don't know if you
can see it but like taking one swatch
and putting it on it's not super
pigmented or to the full capacity that
it could be so then taking a little of
mac fix+ and spring it on this brush and
then going in the kitten and applying it
to my hand
it becomes that much more sparkly can
you see that I think you can I think you
can see it from space it becomes that
much more bright this is a necessity for
anyone who loves eyeshadow or
like the eyeshadow art form because some
people you know people crab but I show
up and that's fine I didn't give a crap
about I shall to like a year ago but um
so I wouldn't need this this wouldn't be
necessary for me but I know damn it to
be necessary now because I love it the
payoff that this gives me and it's just
such an amazing justice principle like
what seems like water it's not water but
it seems like water can make it that
much more vibrant and going off with a
steel kitten um this is also a product
that I found out about it from YouTube
what all these are and I absolutely love
this color with or without fix plus it
still Gibson amazing see that's without
you can't really see it as much but it
gives an amazing shine it's amazing
overall lid color especially when you're
doing smoky eyes if you have a black
brown purple or blue or whatever on your
outer crease and then to just pack this
on with fix+ all over your lid it is the
perfect smokey eye color for it lid okay
next I have NARS blush in orgasm if
you've seen that you've seen this in
videos before my mom's currently using
it now because I didn't like it so I
gave it away she likes it a little bit
more than I ever did but I just am NOT a
huge blush fan and so I don't know if
I'm giving it a fair critique because
this is like this has been like
YouTube's og since the beginning
that's me like scraping my finger on it
and there's just no color pick up like
there's no payoff I'm putting that on it
brush I just don't see much pink I mean
like I guess is showing up I just wanted
this color and you hear everyone orchid
some Park has Morgan some time ago NARS
orgasm it's the best blush and I'm like
I would prefer like tart or elf
seriously because it's not worth the
price for the same exact packaging as
elf it this was made the same company as
ELF eyes lips face cosmetics are which
is sold in Target and Walmart and so
it's the same exact thing for like
billion more dollars not worth it I
don't even like the color maybe I'd like
other colors because I add more of a
orangie tone much girl but this was not
a win for me
speaking about blushes I have a part one
right here which this is a natural
beauty it's there Amazonian 12-hour clay
blush and this is the darkest shade um
this is a very very pigmented blush I do
like it I don't
if I will go back and get this color
again because it is so heavy and just a
little um sorry I'd like a microwave a
little hard to use sometimes if you're
heavy-handed which I tend to be with
makeup or when it comes to makeup I like
a little lot on and so this you really
gotta tap off all the excess and fall
out that could occur before you go in on
it with your cheek because it could ruin
the entire makeup look if you go too
heavy-handed you can always build it up
and you can't take makeup away once it's
on your face you know so be careful with
this um
particular color natural beauty be
careful but this blush I love it because
just one swipe it is so pigmented next
side benefits flowing this is like an
old kind of product it was really
popular back in late 2010 nine eleven
twelve I think first of all I got this
there's only like three shades or four
shades at least it was when I bought
this I don't know if we've had any more
but I got this second shade definitely
definitely wrong on my part it was
during the summer so I guess I was tan
but it is very dark I think the the
lightest one one it's probably dark too
so I hate when brands only have like
three color options to choose from
because not everyone's gonna fall into
the three color categories that you
provide with provide us with so this is
buying it is extremely hard even my mom
is trying to use it and you can't even
with the heat of your finger and the
rubbing motion you can not get easy
product from this container I much
prefer a liquid base concealer and then
usually concealer goes on sits which are
a little sore or under eyes which is a
very thin area region of the face and so
you like scrape this clay on to your
face and it does not provide a good
coverage it's super thick I guess have
you a really bad acne or acne scarring
this would be good to fill the pores or
the acne spots but for just like simple
everyday dark that is I don't I think
it's even it's so nerd' for simple
everyday concealer usage this would not
be the best choice and I was just really
disappointed with this because like I
don't know if I got a whack one but it
doesn't melt it doesn't work I'm showing
you the back it doesn't work it doesn't
glide onto the skin it makes it very
difficult application wise and it was a
disappointing product next I have two
primers I can access a lot with my
prefer better Urban Decay eyeshadow
primer or Mac painterly paint-pot
Mac Paint Pot any day um this
and cashed out my word as a tester I've
had like a hundred of these large ones
that I've bought in the past but the
only one I could find cuz I had a red
bought it because I don't like it as
much um it is a kind of liquidy wet
primer it kind of especially if you have
greasy eyelids this isn't the one I'd
choose because it does kind of glide
everywhere it's just very greasy and
putting eyeshadow on top let me go back
to my kitten to show you
apparently something I should i included
um it just the stickiness takes away
from the color and it melts away and it
doesn't stay on your face the interior
Lib whole day like I real I notice
creasing not to hate on any nice
products or companies and brands or you
know everybody Kasia no harm but I don't
like it
I much prefer Mac Paint Pot I use it
every extra a tutorial and I try to use
it every day
it's just especially you know a Mac
Paint Pot but the one in panel a is just
perfect skin tone color for me and then
you just put a little on it is a play
base so but it is softer than boying so
it's not like you can't move it it is
very easy to move around and cover your
entire eyelid with nice let that pricey
and then putting the eyeshadow on top oh
my god it's so good it's just like look
at that look at that's even without fix
plus it just makes it pop so much more
because it's a skin tone colored base
and so it doesn't draw away any
attention it from the color pigment of
kitten or any eyeshadow that you're
using it doesn't draw away from the eye
shadow itself because it is such a
natural color in a good product because
it is again waxy like a clay so you know
that your eye shouldn't be going
anywhere once you put that on there make
a you gotta wait till it get dry it
dries and gets tacky almost because it's
a runny formula next I am Mac lip liner
in whirl I actually have it on my lips
entirely right now I adore this product
I think it is just an amazing lip liner
here it is kind of a brown topi mauve
color I got it when the whole Kardashian
oh my god Kylie is using this lip I was
like I have it too I don't follow any of
the traditions
social media I just don't care if that
makes sense but I did love how her lips
were looking color wise not size wise
but color I love that lip liner what is
it
antenna it was whirl and it's just such
a pretty color whether you just lemon
lips or wear it entirely it is also a
great liner for a lolita lipstick or
liquid lipstick I have Fundy if you're
wondering but um I just I love this
color and like it's just so different
than any other thing and the great thing
about lip liner is it doesn't really
move when you eat or anything it doesn't
move off your lips and if you do just
retouch a little bit Beauvoir and it's
amazing like that's why I like using the
planners as my lipsticks instead of
lipstick sometimes because they stay a
lot better next I have Captain D's
tattoo liner in the shade of a trooper
which is the black it took me a very
long time to ever purchase this because
I didn't want to spend the money but
like it isn't that much compared to some
of these other things it is a marker
eyeliner um looks more like a liquid
than anything it is very wet it's not
like a pencil but the thing about this
is I always tried the elf marker and it
was always dry so I was like no cath
amazing be dry I don't want that you
know no it's not gonna work but it does
it you just shake it so use the product
to go down to the bristle toothbrush and
it goes on so amazingly and you can
build it up the brush is so thin you can
get the thinnest line up to a thick line
if you know how to use a bristle brush
correctly and it just provides amazing
bright in-your-face color it is a great
eyeliner to use with falsies it blimps
them and blah blah blah is a great
product definitely check this out I was
always against marker liner it's like I
said so I took forever in a day to buy
this but I'm really happy that I do own
it now I got my mom to buy it and my
sister and I just think it is a great
overall eyeliner in it I've had a frayed
about I'm gonna have two months it's
doesn't run out I thought it would dry
out so quickly it doesn't and it's
extremely hard to get off your eyes
which is amazing because you don't want
your eyeliner running or jumping below
your lash line are getting like clutters
up in here you know like this little
boogers you get in your eyes no not with
that because it is marker and it stains
until you get your micro I didn't wipe
it off next I have an elf baked
eyeshadow trio I heard great things
about elf baked eyeshadows rather than
nearly the $6 ones like a mere 3 $6 I
think they're and they're different from
just regular elf I chose because rigify
shows
aren't that good I had before they're
not too bad but they're not amazing but
apparently these baked we're supposed to
be in dishes and I use this in a
tutorial like dipped in the most part
but they're baby tech shadows are like
paper like like not a lot of product
comes off with these and then you put
them on and the only one that shows up
is this white pearly one like the other
ones just fade away and it pissed me off
because this is a beautiful color it's
in the brown Bonanza color if you do own
this or still want to get the big eye
shadows it's not the worst part of your
I ever tried I would recommend you
getting it and then maybe if you have
fix+ it would help bring the pigment out
of this a little more and onto your lid
to stick it there because this just
seems a little like it had good
potential but then the quality wasn't
there to back it up and I just couldn't
get much product off of this and then on
to my eye it kind of like faded away in
the process of putting on the brush and
then putting it onto my eyelid but I'm
not gonna throw this away yet like I do
like it I want to go to another chance
and try with my fix+ which I have I
don't think I have done before and yes
we'll see so it's not that expensive
check it out if you want to but it was
little disappointing because I thought
it would be super pigmented because I
heard things like that um I heard that
it was like so pigmented but then it
like wasn't and I was just like what
next I have naked skin concealer by
Urban Decay this I don't know if I'll
get for this but you know I'm sorry if
you like any of these products like
that's amazing they just do not work for
me this didn't work for me first of all
this is the lightest one of the light
shade light in light and it oxidizes so
yellow tannish um when you put it on I
use this as euro ones and then I
couldn't even finish with it like I had
to put my normal concealer over top of
it cuz it wasn't doing the job it's very
hard to like evenly disperse it so
should the Beauty Blender because it's
so exci so if you do have very merit
maybe like prominent under-eye circles
or dark lines or very bad acne I would
suggest maybe using this cuz it is so
thick but it's just not eat it's it's
waxy and it's hard to move under your
eyelid again kind of like bowing it is
wetter than going
given but um they're just talking about
this I didn't like and I was so excited
try this and I was just like yeah this
is like I think in
in trailer have you been using I'm like
today but it didn't work for me it
wasn't spreading out it wasn't blending
and it wasn't sticking you know my skin
I'm sitting on top of the foundation and
writing on my eye and it looks like a
clown do my makeup and I just mm-hmm
mm-hmm
and then when it oxidizes it turns kind
of like an orange as I can orange a rim
around it which looks like oh she's
wearing clearly wearing makeup to cover
up like whatever lines or whatever and
I'm just like next I have hoola bronzer
this again is one of the oh geez YouTube
like a product that's been around for
freaking ever from benefit I adore this
it is such a classic bronzer it is a
very chokolate II bronzer meaning that
the color is very warm and creamy if you
can see that right there it's hard to
pick up cuz my light is so bright I
apologize for that but it is a very easy
button to work with it's super blendable
if you put too much on like I could put
this entire thing on my cheek and yet
blend it out and make it look seemingly
realistic as a cheekbone this is very
blendable and it's it's easy again like
I said to work with if you put too much
on we're some other bronzers like I like
the Kat Von D shade like I'll talk about
in a second it's very hard to gun them
out once you put them on this email in
four days and you won't have a thing on
your face like it don't it goes like
it'll disappear so you it's buildable if
you can it's easy to work with and I
just love this it comes with a knock off
nurse either brush look-alike by benefit
it's a great bronzing brush gives you
that perfect chiseled cheekbone line and
yet so you get a brush in runs err for
now that extensive I love this product
next I have their real mascara from
benefit in black and blue um it is a
good mascara it is I always wear falsies
so mascara isn't that big of a deal for
me because I will cover them up with
false lashes but it is a big deal my
bottom lashes this didn't make my bottom
lashes um amazing as other one other
mascaras have before so I'm just telling
I wouldn't choose to wear this over a
better than sex or L'Oreal telescopic
per se but I do prefer the black one a
lot over the blue because the blue is
just not that amazing it's super blue
and if you can see that like it's just a
very chalky chalky color it's not a
royal blue even I thought it would
dark navy it's like a freaking cerulean
I didn't like this color I'm a doll on
my lashes it looks really bad I do
appreciate the black so like it does its
job as a black mascara and everyone
loves these and I don't know like maybe
if I didn't wear falsies I would like it
on the top but they're not the most
amazing product I've ever used mascara
next is another benefit product gimme
brow I meant to show you a Nastasia brow
Wiz but I finished it and threw it away
I used to a long long long time ago and
didn't keep it but gimme brow my benefit
this is the brush it's very tiny so you
get right in on your brow and I like
this this is the color in I have dark
brown right where is it medium deep it
is a great again toned Brown but it all
I need to apply is right here in the
base because sometimes I'll over pluck
so I just need the very far my brow and
that's it even if even that and I really
do appreciate this product it's even
nice to just comb on your brow sometime
and just add a little color dispersed
throughout too faced chocolate soleil
bronzer in medium deep it smells like
chocolate it is made with real cocoa you
can lick it if you want to I never have
I think that's weird this color is so so
deep so creamy I really appreciate the
color payoff it does give me it's not
picking up on my camera but you know
it's right there I do appreciate this
color it's a little orange of a bronzer
if you like that I do most people don't
though so be careful that when you're
buying this you know that you're gonna
get quite an orange eat payoff with this
color it's not a deep dark brown it's
orange you like a NYC bronzers it's not
super easy to blend out if you apply too
much but you can work your way up there
I just really appreciate this bronzer I
think it was a great Buy it's
beautifully packaged oh and I'm really
happy that I own it I think it's a
staple
next I have Mac pearl highlighter I hate
this I'm sorry Maxo my favorite brand I
cannot do this i watch the crispys video
or she like used to this and wants to
get some getting that I hate it it is a
cream based highlighter not like a Becca
powder highlighter and it's easy it's
not like hard like pointing like it's
easy to get color on your finger and
looks like oh my god beautiful but it's
the chubbiest thing it doesn't go on
smooth it doesn't really work with my
foundation routine I guess because
and I knew my foundation in the MEK
powder whether that's face powder blush
bronzer or highlight and then this just
like moves my foundation with it because
it is such a thick creamy formula you I
really like buff it into your skin with
your finger or like a cream brush I
guess but it just moved my foundation
around redness starts to show cuz I do
have extreme redness in my cheeks and I
hate it I used it once and I was like a
girl by I'm speaking about highlighters
I do have champagne pop by Becca and
chocolate Hill this is the only Becca
highlight I currently own
I owned once in the past but I broke
this actually but then I used a alcohol
sorry rubbing alcohol to pour in it and
then smush back together and now good as
new
oh my god it's perfect it's like a new
highlighter again this look girl bye
what is that it's perfect it's amazing
it's my favorite Becca has the absolute
perfect highlighters is that like their
specialty is like Becca
highlighter because I feel like it's
only amazing probably you've ever seen
from them but um that's what I'm known
for
it's incredible like this color is
amazing Jeff did a great job on it
because the other colors I do like but
pearl and what's the really broad one I
forgot that it's called but they're
extremely hard to work with some skin
tones this is just a nice sandy pink a
peachy glittery shade and it just goes
right on looks amazing on most skin
types and I love it it's definitely
worth of money it's expensive I get that
highlights are expensive but I do
believe it's worth it because I've had
this for almost a year and I broken it
and it's still good doing great still
going strong and I sell a lot of product
it alas then I have a Maybelline lasting
drama waterproof gel pencil in the shade
lustrous sapphire Trisha Paytas was
using this on her lower lashline
waterline it's eight like tert blue
eyeliner so I divide it because James
has gotta love her
but again I thought it was going to be
like a dark navy it looked amazing on
her it didn't look good on me you can
blatantly see that I'm wearing like I'm
trying to rock blue eyeliner when I wear
this and I didn't want to look like that
because it is more of a royal blue than
a navy and I guess
should realize that from packaging it
also is very runny it's like lasting
drama it doesn't really last though like
it just likes it just kind of smears
everywhere especially my eyes were to
ever water so if not one that I'll run
to go apply it's on my favorite product
by Maybelline or my favorite eyeliner by
any man's I have em maybelline instant
age rewind dark circle treatment
concealer this is the sponge tip
applicator one that you crank up it
should get product cool up here
sometimes I have a problem with that
sometimes no one's oh but for the most
part we're fine I thought this was the
most amazing concealer of life before I
found my Maybelline um Mac master
conceal about it yeah which I adore this
one though is very maybe I have to
darker shade cuz it's not a highlighting
color and I get they have a highlighting
one in this but I think I think that's
problem it's in light pale so you think
that it wouldn't be this orange but yet
again when it oxidizes it is very orange
II and the thing about this is it's
super lightweight it's not a good
concealer if you have dark circles under
eye bags you know acne it's just for
like maybe like thin smile lines or
something you want to try to hide
because it is very light it's not a
thick concealer it's not gonna cover
much it's very light but you could
almost use it as a frickin foundation
because or a BB cream because it doesn't
provide much coverage and then yet again
it oxidizes so I loved it when I was
using it until I explored they make
uprisings a little more and realize
there's a lot better stuff out there
than this next I am my favorite mascara
ever better than sex by Too Faced this
is like a heavy aluminum metal winner
aluminum girl by a metal like mascara
like case or whatever on a bottle the
brush is like this kinda looks boring
kind of doesn't look like anything
special but it gives you so much clumpy
volume I know Columbia is a turn-off
word for a lot a lot of people but I
really enjoyed that it does it's not
like oh it gives you three spider lashes
like it does give you like lashes but it
clumps up together makes them look very
full and voluminous and I love this for
my bottom lashes it just makes them so
in-your-face which I adore because when
you wear falsies on top you don't your
bottom lashes to get lost and so this
really helps plump them up love this
Marc Jacobs
lipgloss
in 3 1 2 you sugar sugar um I do like
this but it's I feel like it's like any
other lipgloss like there was no reason
I need to spend that much money it has a
beautiful mint kind of smell and taste
to it so I really appreciate that
it's extremely sticky oh my god so if
you're like if there's wind anywhere do
not wear this or a lot of it it's not
something it's like named in our
cupcakes but anyway besides that it's
just extremely extremely sticky you see
that it's a beautiful colored sugar
sugar it is a beautiful new pale pink
goes perfectly with Mac angel lipstick
Mac angel is another one that you need
to get gold by Mac angel lipstick what
are you doing anyway
um but I did include the excess hard to
have so many times next I have another
shopping one naked Urban Decay basics
palette I hate this with a passion I
know everyone loves it and buys a
hundred of them I hate this I don't know
what it is I think all the colors soft
personally I don't okay if you like this
product that's amazing
hey guys awesome go run and tell someone
about it but like I don't like it so I'm
gonna in my opinion you might hate
everything I use on my face that's not
gonna offend me cuz it's not me it's
product and I don't want you to be like
oh my god I'm gonna get no because some
people when they hear I hate a product
that they think it's like oh cheese me
no girl come on
it gives you six colors I should go this
is a birthday present and that's what
excited because I've run it for my
collection
um in my makeup collection because I do
have all the naked palettes but this is
just so basic you got a white a yellow
white a pale white a gray white a brown
and black
I just can't there's not even like I
know it's a basic cut I get that but
it's just like could you have like a
grey or a stark white or a yellow or a
tan like these colors are just I'm not
even a huge fan of Urban Decay eye
shadows in the first place because they
are very very hard to blend the only one
I like this palette is the brown one
faint I use that sometimes but it's
super hard to blend out so make sure
that if you're putting on a place you
really want it there because it will not
move
don't like this palette not worth the
money next I have Laura Mercier's
translucent powder is the loose setting
powder by her I love this
I do but cover no powder which is my
tried and true face setting powder
that's like five dollars and I've used
forever it's literally the same thing
they're both towel powder and they both
are great for baking and they both don't
crease and they both um set your makeup
and make you anti grease but I just
don't know if I'd spend $40 first that
it's great it's amazing I really do
enjoy it I'm glad I have it I'm glad I
got it I'm glad I use it but like I said
if you want to save the money there's
powder everywhere
go get the covergirl one it's the same
thing I haven't noticed any benefit or
difference or cut or pro from this that
that one hasn't given me before it is a
little whiter where the other ones a
little not tan but a little more skin
tone this is translucent light I like it
I'm not gonna say any bad bad because I
do enjoy it and I do use it everyday but
the other ones so much cheaper so just
warning you lastly we have the Kat Von D
shade and light palette huge product
here in YouTube oh my god um I like it
I am super happy thankful and glad that
I bought it and own it a lot of these
colors don't work for me however um this
one is a little too gray toned I guess
you could say for powder this one's way
too yellow you can clearly see I'm
wearing under-eye powder when I put it
there and then this one's very very
peachy salmony this one's right here
it's super dark this runs are super gray
toned like it makes you look like a
ghost almost when you apply it and this
one is the good bronzer that I use
however it is very hard to blend out so
if you're gonna put online and try to
bake it it'll still be there when you
remove that baking because it is so
pigmented and so hard to move that being
said it's beautiful packaging I love how
it says the names of things in the back
collection no names I love the mirror I
love the packaging I love companies line
um I feel like some people's skin tones
would work better with this because mine
is such a complicated skin tone with
many different colors within it you know
pink yellow red white you know there's
made of skin tones some of these are
hard to work with that being said it's
expensive it is expensive and I heard
that they're coming out with singles of
these so if I were to tell you to get
one of the powders in one of the
bronzers I would say the middle girl
which is this shade shadow play and it's
a beautiful creamy chocolate color and
the powder I would get is if you are
more olive toned get this yellow on it
is beautiful on is called lyric and it's
beautiful on skin tone so that it works
for which is not mine but I use this
powder more I think than this real
peachy one because the foundation I use
is a little more white than peach tone
so I do go with this one which is
levitation I'm glad I own it I wouldn't
return it or trade it but it is hard for
me to use sometimes and I just be
careful because the shadows are so
brilliantly created with pigments that
is sometimes hard to blend that is my
youtube made me by it's video I really
enjoyed this you helped me to apart - I
definitely will leave me products that
you want me to try or buy or whatever
review down below and I'll happily make
this a series and do more in the future
or tell me any products that are huge
that I left out because there's probably
tons that I forgot about but this is the
ones that I saw and my collection that I
knew I wanted to speak about and talk on
behalf of so if you're not hmm subscribe
to my channel and become a fierce and
confident do like me and there was Tomas
