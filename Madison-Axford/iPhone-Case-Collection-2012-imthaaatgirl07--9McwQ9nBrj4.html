collection and I'm super excited because
I have quite a bountiful amount of
iphone cases that I would love to share
with you because I'm kind of obsessed
with them and I'm kind of rocking this
little Cindy Lou Who bun crazy Missy
hair thing um and my window of my room
is open one of them is so if you're like
cars driving by our people talking or
anything um yeah my windows open because
it was way too nice for it to be closed
someone without further ado let's get
started can we just take a second to say
how cute this is yes this is my old ipod
like nano mini I don't know what this is
called um yeah is not new it's pretty
old that I just sound it and it's pink
and it's super cute and I'm just in love
with it so I uploaded um like all my new
music on because it had because really
also from when I was like 12 and I was
like what is this you know Hannah
Montana high school musical but anyway i
upload it with my new jams
and yeah so I'm sorry use it against
alone perfectly good shape I'm excited I
found this so in now we'll begin ok so
in no random order starting off this
iphone case collection video is just
this super super cute hard umm qais car
space moment black white polka dots and
it has a pink Rimmer on the sides and
this is just it has great protection
it's kind of like a kate spade phone
case look like but it's like a knockoff
it's not really Kate Spade but I got
stuff ebay not really sure from like
what the person i got it from was but I
just even if you look up iphone cases
black an white polka dot some shrink
found one similar to it if not this
exact replica and I just really like
this I haven't used it as much as some
of the others but um I just think it's
really really cute and it's really girly
and I like this case the next case I
have is a kate spade it's kind of like
the opposite I mean it's kind of the
same thing but um I got this one after
it because I liked those colors so much
so this one has a black background with
white polka dots and it says kate spade
and then L so has a hotter pink rim
around it and then on the inside it says
kate spade new york have courage and i
just love the little things inside of
these iphone cases even though they're
not visible to um you know your eye but
it's just it's cute and I like the quote
so yes this one was a little more
expensive obviously is name brand Kate
Spade but again ebay I get most of my
cases from either a local store which I
cannot say the name of or um ebay so
easy just go on there and you know get
them from that the next and last Kate
Spade one is this one that I got during
the summer which I was like obsessed
with because it is orange yellow and
white super bright super summary like
the Sun that's what we're writing me up
again it's just kate spade its striped
on the inside has
hey Jimmy quiet ups mode again the
inside just says kate spade new york
kept courage and young man colors yellow
with an orange rim and i just really
love her cases they're so durable if you
drop him they're very good at protecting
your phone um and yeah I have to get
pretty good like protecting cases
because um two days after I got my first
iphone I fell down a am floor stairs in
Nashville and yeah so did the iphone so
it kind of dropped shattered uh-huh
dropped and shattered and i had to use
like that for seven months i was totally
fine with it because it was my fault I
mean I did it of course the fault was on
accident but yeah so I'm after seven
months I did get my phone fixed and i'm
going to show you what i have on my
phone right now i can this is no random
order anyway this my phone it is fixed i
gotta fix I'm thinking january ish
febuary ouch maybe um and this is my
newest case my addition to this little
collection and if you bought $65 worth
at Victoria's Secret you got a free case
and I did and it's just blue sparkly
glitter it's beautiful and says love
pink and this has to be one of my
favorite cases because it is the newest
1i haven't used that long and I just
love how shimmery this looks and um the
sparkles don't come off on your finger
because that's like um the paint that's
on it it's not like real sparkles but if
that makes sense so if you like rub it
on you and now you won't get sparkles on
you so yes what is again it's not that
great protection it doesn't really come
up on beyond this just the sides but
it's black RAM and yeah I really really
love this new case and it was free the
next case I have is an otterbox but it's
not like a huge um durable otterbox it's
just kinda like this flimsy rubber one
which is nice because those I do have a
white otterbox and there's three parts
to getting it on which is kind of
troublesome and like it's just it's such
it's so like annoying after what for
you're like me and change cases like it
was every week um so this one still has
great protection totally protects it all
around the phone so yeah this is an
otterbox it's yellow is just completely
a yellowish orange super simple you've
got this from ebay and the kate spade
ones are from ebay too so all these are
from you guys so far except the
Victoria's Secret one I got that one
from the story next is my
outer box this is the three part one
where it has like this if you can see
this plastic screen protector built-in
and it's just plain white I loved the
plain white otterbox it's one of the
best cases you can get for your phone
you drop it down like a floor stairs and
it wouldn't have cracked with this um
when I did fall down stairs I didn't
have a case on it cuz i only had it for
two days and the first case that i got
was being shipped from china i think
yeah off ebay so obviously i wasn't here
yet so um yeah fell down stairs i will
list similar cases if not the same one
down below like the ones i got from ebay
um nut stores but ones from he Bay in
case you wanted to find something
similar to that because ebay has pretty
much every case you can find the next
case i have is from a local store so i'm
not going to say the name but it just
has a lot of mustaches on it again it's
not very good protecting does it really
come up the sides by just thinks you're
cute it has one black mustache super
artsy and chic if you watch my black
friday haul you'll know that I went to a
craft fair randomly on black friday and
i got this avengers case i love the
avengers so yeah i just got this case it
was super cheap it was kind of like ab
the ordinary for me i'm not really like
in a superhero stuff that much but i
like this movie so i just kind of picked
up this case the next case i got from
Francesca's it's store in my mall i'm
sure you have a french escas near you
it's kind of like a boutique store it's
pretty new and just as with God all
things are possible it has this cross
I'm super mad that a part of the w came
off so it looks like like it's or miss
mom anyway I paid eighteen dollars for
this of Francesca's and I'm so mad that
it's like the writing just like came off
like farts a pretty protective case even
though it's just flimsy rubber again and
has a cute little detail around the home
button ah it's cute minus the w jake
eNOS ok the next case i got from old
navy I know totally weird old navy but
it's this super beautiful bejeweled case
it was 1250 and I'm just in love with
this everyone always asked me if I
didn't myself and I'm like I am not that
creative you think I'm actually spend
time making this whole thing bejeweled
no not gonna happen but I love this is
one of my fee
grunts and the uppers next case was the
first case I ever bought its kind of
from China like I said before and it's
this super durable hello cutie case
again it's flimsy pink rubber and every
girl needs a hello kitty case oh yes
this was like 350 super cheap super
worth it the next case my mom and dad
got me for my birthday and I'm in love
with it is a tory burch light blue case
with a orange brownish um tory burch
decal in the middle I'm just in love
with this case is super simple super
adorable and I am obsessed the tory
burch next is another one my favorites
just like the tory burch one in it my
lilly pulitzer case now i got this at
the lilly pulitzer store which is on
local again so i'm not consider name
it's just the print Chum Bucket and pink
and green super summary I got during the
summer it's adorable the only thing
that's like a downside about it is like
this paint if you can see like this
around here right there um right there
it like rubs off so easily like I took
very good I take very good care of all
my cases like they're not broken and I
ripped or anything and like I just text
and then like it rubs off which that's
kind of annoying because this was $25
whatever in the last case I got was from
a street vendor when I went to New York
in September like I think I've said that
like a hundred times during my videos
but anyway it's this pink bunny eared
case and it kinds of the little pink
fluffy tail super adorable and so you
just like it's like sticks onto the back
of your iPhone and that the only bad
thing about this is like it's kind of
hard to push your off button like that
button cuz it's like really thick and
not well made but it was ten dollars off
a street vendor and I've been looking
for one of these cases ever since I saw
macbarbie 07 with hers and it's hot pink
has ears I love this and it's like it's
such a hit like every time i text
animals like it's funny or like you're
calling someone yeah that's really fun
