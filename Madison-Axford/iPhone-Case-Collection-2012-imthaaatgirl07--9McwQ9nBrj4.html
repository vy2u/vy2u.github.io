so today i'm ching-yi iphone case the
collection and I'm super excited because
I have quite a bountiful amount of
iPhone cases and I would love to share
with you because I'm kind of obsessed
with them and I'm kind of rocking this
little cindy-lou who bun crazy messy
hair thing um and my window of my room
is open one of them is so if you're like
cars driving by are people talking or
anything yeah my windows open cuz it was
way too nice for it to be closed so on
without further ado let's get started
can we just take a second to say how
cute this is yes this is my old iPod
like nano mini I don't know what this is
called um yeah is not new it's pretty
old that I just sound it and it's pink
and it's super cute and I'm just in love
with it so I uploaded um like all my new
music on because it had this really old
stuff from when I was like 12 and I was
like what is this you know he a Montana
High School Musical but anyway I upload
it with my new jams
and yeah so I'm starting to use it again
it's still in perfectly good shape and
excited I found this so and now we'll
begin okay so in no random order
starting off this iPhone case collection
video it's just this super super cute
hard umm case car black white polka dots
and it has a pink Rimmer on the sides
and this is it has great protection it's
kind of like a Kate Spade phone case
look like but it's like a knockoff it's
not really Kate Spade but I got stuff i
bay not really sure from like what the
person that got it from Liz but I'm just
even if you look up iPhone cases black
an white polka dot some shrink fonts
similar to it if not this exact replica
and I just really like this I haven't
used it as much as some of the others
but um I just think it's really really
cute and it's really girly and I like
this case the next case I have is a case
be hated it's kind of like the opposite
I mean it's kind of the same thing but
um I got one after it because I liked
those colors so much so this one has a
black background with white polka dots
and it says Kate Spade and then I also
has a hotter pink rim all around it and
then on the inside of says Kate's a New
York have courage and I just love the
little things inside of these iPhone
cases even though they're not visible to
um you know your eye but it's just it's
cute and I like the quote so yes this
one was a little more expensive
obviously is name-brand Kate Spade but
again eBay I get most of my cases from
either a local store which I cannot say
the name of or um eBay so easy just go
on there and you know get them from that
the next and last Kate Spade one is the
Sun that I got during the summer which I
was like obsessed with because it is
orange yellow and white super bright
super summery like the Sun um that's
what we're writing me up again it's just
Kate Spade it's striped on the inside
has
hey jebby quiet UPS man um again the
insight just says Kate Spade New York
courage and yeah the main colors yellow
with an orange rim and I just really
love her cases they're so durable if you
drop them they're very good at
protecting your phone um and yeah I have
to get pretty good like protecting cases
because um two days after I got my first
iPhone I fell down a floor stairs in
Nashville and yeah so did the iPhone so
it kind of um dropped shattered uh-huh
dropped and shattered and I had to use
it like that for seven months I was
totally fine with it because it was my
fault
I mean I did it of course the fault was
on accident but yeah so um after seven
months I did get my phone fixed and I'm
going to show you what I have on my
phone right now I can this is no random
order anyway this is my phone it is
fixed I got a fixed I'm thinking January
ish Febuary ish maybe um and this is my
newest case in my addition to this
little collection and if you bought $65
worth at Victoria's Secret you got a
free case and I did and it's just blue -
sparkly glitter it's beautiful and it
says love pink and this has to be one of
my favorite cases because it is the
newest one I haven't used it that long
and I just love how shimmery this looks
and um the sparkles don't come off on
your finger because that's like um the
paint that's on it it's not like real
sparkles but if that makes sense
so if you like rub it on you and now you
won't get sparkles on you so yes what is
again it's not that great protection it
doesn't really come up on beyond this
just the sides but this black rim and
yeah I really really love this new case
and it was free then the next case they
have sin OtterBox but it's not like a
huge um durable OtterBox it's just kinda
like this flimsy rubber one which is
nice because those I do have a white
outer box and there's three parts to
getting it on which is kind of
troublesome and like it's just such it's
so like annoying after a while you're
like me and change cases like it was
every week um so this one still has
great protection totally protects it all
around the phone so yeah this is an
otterbox it's yellow it's just
completely a yellowish orange it's super
simple yeah got this from eBay and the
Kate Spade ones are from eBay - so all
these are from eBay so far except the
Victoria's Secret one I got that one
from the store next is my
box this is the three-part one where it
has like this if you can see this
plastic screen protector built-in and
it's just plain white I loved the plain
white outer box it's one of the best
cases you can get for your phone you
drop it down like a flower stairs and it
wouldn't have cracked with us um when I
did fall down stairs I didn't have a
case on it cuz I only had it for two
days and the first case that I got was
being shipped from China I think yeah
off eBay so obviously I wasn't here yet
so um yeah fell down stairs I will list
similar cases if not the same one down
below like the ones I got from eBay nuts
stores but ones from he Bay in case you
wanted to find something similar to that
um because eBay has pretty much every
case you can find the next case I have
is from a local store so I'm not gonna
say the name but it just has a lot of
mustaches on it again it's not very good
protecting does it really come up the
sides if I just thinks very cute it has
one black mustache super artsy and chic
if you watched my book Freddy Hall
you'll know that I went to a craft fair
randomly on Black Friday and I got this
Avengers case I love the Avengers so
yeah I just got this case it was super
cheap it was kinda like AB the ordinary
who me I'm not really like in a
superhero stuff that much but I like
this movie so I just kind of picked up
this case the next case I got from
Francesca's it's store in my mall I'm
sure you have a French eskas near you
it's kind of like a boutique store it's
pretty new and just as with God all
things are possible it has this cross
I'm super mad that a part of the W came
off so it looks like like it's earning
this much anyway I paid eighteen dollars
for this at francesca's and I'm so mad
that it's like the writing just like
came off like farts a pretty protective
case even though it's just flimsy rubber
again and has a cute little detail
around the home button ah it's cute - V
W Jake eveness okay the next case I got
from Old Navy I know totally weird old
navy but it's this super beautiful
bejeweled case it was twelve fifty and
I'm just in love with this everyone
always asked me if I did it myself and
I'm like I am not that creative
you think I'm actually spend time making
this whole thing bejeweled no not gonna
happen but I love this is one of my
and the uppers next case was the first
case I ever buy it's time from China
like I said before and it's this super
durable Hello Kitty case again it's
flimsy pink rubber and every girl needs
a Hello Kitty case oh yes this was like
350 super cheap super worth it
the next case my mom and dad guy fry
birthday and I'm in love with it is a
Tory Burch light blue case with a orange
brownish um Tory Burch decal in the
middle I'm just in love with this case
is super simple super adorable and I am
obsessed the Tory Burch next is another
one my favorites just like the Tory
Burch one in it my Lilly Pulitzer case
now I got this at there's a Lilly
Pulitzer store which is a local again so
I'm not going to say the name it's just
the print chumbucket and it's pink and
green super summery I got during the
summer it's adorable the only thing
that's like a downside about it is like
this paint if you can see like this
around here right there right there it
like rubs off so easily like I took very
good I take very good care of all my
cases like they're not broken that I
ripped or anything and like I just text
and then like it rubs off which that's
kind of annoying because this was $25
whatever in the last case I got was from
a street vendor when I went to New York
in September like I think I've said that
like a hundred times through my videos
but anyway it's this pink bunny eared
case and it kinds of the little pink
fluffy tails super adorable and so you
just like it's like sticks onto the back
of your iPhone and the only bad thing
about this is like it's kind of hard to
push your off button like that button
cuz it's like really thick and not well
made but it was $10 off a street vendor
and I've been looking for one of these
cases ever since I saw Matt Barr bo7
with hers and it's hot pink has ears I
love this and it's like it's such a hit
like every time I'm texting I was like
it's funny you're like you're calling
someone yeah that's really fun you
enjoyed this video remember to look in
