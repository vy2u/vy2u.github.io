today's video was so highly requested
and if you follow me on Instagram you
would have seen my story from yesterday
and I asked you guys if you'd be
interested in seeing a video about 20
things that I learned in the 20 years
that I have been living I decided to do
this video today because it is my 21st
birthday and before I get started with
the video I just wanted to personally
say thank you to all of you for all of
your kind words and birthday wishes
today I woke up and I had so many
comments on my picture so many DM so
many messages on tumblr from you guys
wishing me a happy birthday and honestly
I just wanted to thank you from the
bottom of my heart and meant so much to
me and it was so like heartwarming
waking up and seeing all those messages
and like getting them throughout the day
just because like it shows how much you
guys care about me and how much you guys
like my videos and things like that so I
don't know it's just like a really good
feeling getting all those messages so I
wanted to personally say thank you in my
video and without further ado let's get
started with the 20 things that I have
learned in the 20 years of my life so I
made a list on my phone of all of them
and number one is do what you love and
what makes you happy
this is something that I live by do what
you love do what makes you happy it's
your life your decisions and nobody else
really has a say in that so if you're
doing what makes you happy and you know
that you're living your life to the
fullest then that's all that matters
number two family is important I think
that this one's really important because
your family is going to be there for you
no matter what and through everything
that you're gonna go through so I just
think that as you I got older I started
to realize that your family is important
and they do have your best interest and
your parents are gonna be there for you
through everything your siblings
everyone in your family would do
anything for you no matter what so it
just really cherish your family and be
thankful for them number three ice cream
is always a good idea if you guys follow
me on snapchat if you don't you totally
show it it's just magma Donald but
scream is my absolute favorite life is
too short to be like oh my god ice-cream
is unhealthy like I'm not gonna eat
anything unhealthy ice-cream is always a
good idea guys like seriously I've never
forgot it at a time that I've had an
ice-cream number for friendships come
and go I think that this is something
that I realized once I got to college
you are friends with a lot of people in
high school and once you graduate high
school you guys move on to different
parts of your life and you experience
different things and you're with
different people and it's natural to
lose contact with some people that you
have friends with in high school
honestly my parents told me this when I
graduated and they said that once you
graduate high school and you're in
college your circle of friends is going
to get smaller and smaller and it
happens every single year and that's
completely normal you are making new
friendships getting out of touch with
some of your old friendships and that's
completely fine that's life that's the
way that it works do not feel bad about
it or feel like you personally did
anything wrong that's just the way life
is and sometimes those friendships just
don't end up working out me and then
that doesn't mean anything bad and
there's nothing wrong with that it's
just like your life I don't really know
how to describe it but basically don't
worry if some of your friendships don't
work out I promise you that whoever is
meant to be in your life will be in your
life and stay there so everything
happens for a reason I would not worry
about it at all number five going along
with what I said before your best
friends will always have your best
interest and for me you guys know who
you are you will always have my best
interest I think that your best friends
are people who are going to be there for
you through everything they're gonna
completely support you they are going to
support literally every single decision
you've ever made when you do something
good they are going to congratulate you
they're going to be happy for you you
guys are going to go through so much
together and I think that as you get
older you really see true colors and get
to realize who your true friends are
number six
never go to bed wearing makeup I cannot
stress this enough you guys no matter
how tired I am or whatever the situation
may be I will always take off my makeup
you really need to take it off before
you go to bed because the bacteria and
I can get on your face I don't know just
like really freaks me out so something
that I've learned growing up is just
always take your makeup off no matter
what it's always nice to get into bed
with a fresh clean face plus you don't
want the makeup and all the bacteria
getting on your pillowcases and then
you're gonna be sleeping on that for the
next few nights so I just think that
it's so important to wash your face
before going to bed number seven tell
the people that you love that you love
them and appreciate them often I think
that this is so important because the
people who you love and truly care about
should know how you feel about them it's
just such a good feeling
picture your friendships and your
relationships and imagine the person
that you care about or people that you
are best friends with like telling you
how much they love you how much they
care about you it's just such a good
feeling so it's important to let those
people know how you're feeling that you
love and care about them that was a
tongue twister number eight it's
important to ask your friends and your
family how their day is something so
little can make someone feel so good
number nine make yourself happy before
anyone else this is something that I
have really realized lately
it's your life and these are your
decisions and your happiness
so you should put your happiness before
other people not saying that you can't
do things to make other people happy but
a lot of the time I know for me I am a
people pleaser I always want to make
other people happy and I don't stop to
think about myself first like you need
to realize is this decision that you're
gonna make or the thing that you're
gonna do going to make you genuinely
happy like yeah it could make other
people happy around you but does it make
you happy and I think that that's
something that's so important you should
definitely make yourself happy before
you try to make anybody else happy
number 10 having confidence is important
and I think that this is something that
people often look down upon when people
have confidence they take it the wrong
way and they're like oh that person is
so stuck-up they're so full of
themselves like they could say anything
about you but I think confidence is so
important it is such a good quality to
have and there's nothing wrong with
being confident in yourself confidence
is a great quality to have so if you are
confident embrace it and just keep being
you and the people who are meant to be
in your life and who are meant for you
to be surrounded by them they will
- naturally number 11 I don't know how
to say this without it coming off the
wrong way but looks aren't everything I
think that that's so important to
realize because as you get older and you
go into college and things like that
you're gonna be in so many different
situations and meeting so many different
people that it's really important to not
judge a book by its cover and I know
that's cliche like not don't judge a
book by its cover
but it's true I would never judge
anybody no matter what they looked like
how they dressed how any of the things
that have to do the parents are until I
get to know them personally number
twelve treat yourself and I am the
biggest believer in treating yourself I
think that it's so important to for me
every two weeks I go and get a manicure
and I just think that it's nice to do
that for yourself sometimes like sit
down and pamper yourself and like get a
manicure go out buy face masks do face
masks at home buy yourself a coffee buy
yourself flowers whatever it may be
treat yourself because you work hard and
you deserve it number 13 take care of
your body and I cannot stress this
enough taking care of your body is so
important because it is your home and
it's where you live so eat healthy 80%
of the time drink a lot of water um have
a good skin care routine wash your face
at night shower daily things like that
just take care of your body it will feel
so good
also another point I want to make is
what you put into your body is what is
going to reflect on the outside like if
you eat good food you're gonna feel good
look good all those things I'm not going
to get that too detail about it but
definitely take care of yourself 4:14 be
kind to others number 15 say hi first
think about like if you're at a party or
walking on campus at your school and you
see someone that you know and you don't
say hi to that I don't know I just feel
like for me I want to say hi to them
first because you never know like if
they were too scared to say hi to you or
like they just didn't notice that you
were there just saying hi to somebody
you're never going to regret saying hi
to someone and I learned that from
arlynn so shout out to Ireland say hi to
people first you are never gonna regret
saying hi to somebody number 16 go out
to eat with your friends more often
this is so important because I know a
lot of people sometimes don't like to go
to eat because it could be expensive but
I promise you when I tell you that going
out to eat with your friends is so
important you're not gonna think back
and be like oh my god I wish I didn't go
out to eat with my friends and spend
that $15 you're gonna be like wow I went
out to eat with my friends that time and
we had such a good time we made such
great memories you're not gonna think
back and regret the money you spent
you're just gonna cherish the moments
that you made with your friends number
17
work hard I think that this is important
because working hard there are really no
bad results that you can get from
working hard and trying your best
there's no excuse you can't feel like oh
my god well I could have worked harder
because you're doing the best you can
and you're trying your best so the
results most of the time have to be good
and if they're bad you can learn a
lesson from that
so definitely work hard number 18 I
learned this one from my field hockey
coach in high school but she used to
always say pain is temporary and it's so
true and it's so much easier said than
done when you're in the moment and
you're feeling so hurt but pain really
is temporary and honestly time heals
everything so just wait it out like
things may happen in your life that
you're gonna think are so awful and so
bad in the moment but I don't know I
just feel like going on to the next
thing I'm about to say I'm not gonna say
it cuz gonna give it away but pain is
temporary and I promise you that time
heals everything if you just wait it out
everything will work out the way it's
supposed to be before the 19:00
everything happens for a reason I
strongly believe in this one too because
I feel like everything in your life
happens for a reason people are put into
your life for a reason situations in
your life happen for a reason I just
feel like you learn a lot from that
happening and life isn't always going to
be easy there are always gonna be things
that are thrown at you in your life that
are hard but nothing in life is gonna
come easy and it just is gonna show you
how strong of a person you are that you
can overcome these things and do not
forget that you are a strong person
don't let anybody ever tell you
otherwise and number-20
last but not least my favorite quote
that I have always lived by and that
is to enjoy the little things I think
that this is one of my favorite quotes
it has been for so long because it's so
true enjoy the little things in life
going to get a coffee with your friends
in the morning driving in the car and
singing with your best friend laying out
the beach and closing your eyes and just
listening to the water and the waves
crash against the shore like little
things like that being on FaceTime with
your friend like going out to eat with
your mom going for a walk I just think
that it's so important to enjoy the
little things in life and I don't know

learned in the 20 years of my life I
