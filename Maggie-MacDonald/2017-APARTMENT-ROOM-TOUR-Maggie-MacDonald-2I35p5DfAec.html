fall candle so I highly recommend it it

fake white flowers and my favorite
candle from Anthropologie then I also

because if I'm drinking water or
anything I can put it on my table and
not have it make like a wet ring around
it then of course I just have my phone I
have the iPhone 7 with the red case from
the Apple store so I just keep that
charging next to my bed every night and
my bed is raised up that's why it's a
lot taller than my tables I just
actually raised it I got some better

the bottom as you can see next to my bed
I just have my little kind of office

so coming over here I have
these Alex drawers from Ikea these are
super helpful I don't know what I would

in all those but just to start off with

seriously is amazing and it's also very
inexpensive then I just have some cotton

sensational white pumpkin candle it
smells like fall it's amazing I love it
so much and behind all that I just have
this gold coral jewelry holder which I

a dust bag and things like that so I
just have the necklaces that I wear

place to keep it I just have my little
Louie Vuitton card holder and then this
new teaching that I got from
Anthropologie then I just have like my
car keys my apartment keys things like
that so that is what's on top of my Alex
drawers going into what is inside of
them so this top drawer just has a bunch
of sunglasses back there and then I also
have some dust bags with jewelry and
these are just those little tie hair
ties I have a bunch of those in there
and these are all of my chopsticks lip

female polishes in here so that's what's
in there

lotions these two drawers are completely
empty but going on to this one it just
has all of my makeup products in there I
have some palettes over here back here I

just have like all my primary
foundations concealers mascara some
loose eyeshadows so I have all those and
this bottom drawer right here just has a
bunch of shower essentials like some
moisturizers my wet brushes my shampoo

this one right here has my box of self
tanners from Lovington I'll be doing a
self tanning routine very soon on my
channel so stay tuned for that and then
I also just have some what is this stuff
called nail polish remover and then in
the last drawer down here it's super
messy but I just have some miscellaneous
chargers portable chargers headphones
all that in there and right here above
my desk I just have these little white
frames that I got from Christmas tree
shops and I printed out some photos of
me and my closest friends on them and I
just printed them in black and white and
put them in the frames and that's
obviously me and my roommate Kayleigh
and then I have a photo of me and Emma
me and my best friend Marcos this one is
me and my best friend Molly and then
this photo right here is me and Ernie
and this one is me and my best friend B
so I just have those photos hanging
above my little desk area I really like
the vibe that it gives it's really
simple and neutral and plain so I'm
really happy with the way that it came
out then going on to my favorite area of
my whole room and that is my desk for my
desk chair I just have this little white
stool from Ikea it was very
Spence if I think it was only like $5
and then underneath I just have my gold
wire trash basket thingy and then on top
I have my Mac desktop computer that I
edit all my videos on I love it so much
then again I just have a little coaster
on my desk in case like I'm drinking
water while I'm doing work and stuff
like that and then over here on my desk
for some little accessories I just have
this gold spiky thing from Target and
then I also have this candle from Target
it's called sweet sangria it smells
amazing I really just like the gold vibe
and gold aesthetic so I like to have all
these items altogether and then I have
just this little gold cup container
thing from Target as well that just
holds like my scissors my lighter for my
candles and then like some pens and
sharpies and stuff like that then I have
like my Apple watch charger and a phone
charger back there hidden away then down
here there's like a little opening door
thing and it just has my Apple watch box
and my portable Bose speaker in here
this is like my ride-or-die love this
thing so much about for Christmas last
year and honestly I use it all the time
it's perfect like for going to the beach
or listening to music when you're at
home in the shower or whatever so that's
my favorite and down here I just have a
bunch of random stuff I was cleaning out
my Alex drawers and I took some of this
stuff out that was in one of the empty
drawers it's just like a bunch of
toothbrushes that I have these are my
favorite toothbrushes ever they're just
the ones that are electric I have a
brand new razor I have my serum and my
facial oil right here and then I just
have my toner and then what is this I
have a little Mario Badescu drying
lotion right here and then all the way
in the back there I just this wooden
thing right there is an aroma diffuser
and I got that sent to me and that's
honestly amazing I sometimes use it like
when I'm stressed out I'll put like a
lavender oil in it just to kind of help
calm me down and stuff then down here I
just have on the last little shelf some
of my travel toiletries and there's I
think a makeup bag under there too
because
obviously I don't use my makeup since
it's all in the drawer so I don't need a
bag for it so that's what's in my little
kind of compartment right there and then
right here I just have a mirror like a
big tall one where obviously I can like
check out my opens and stuff and this is
me chillin on my new rug and yeah I
really like the rug right here because I
think that it helps honestly this is got
to be so stupid but it makes it look
better in pictures because this rug
underneath is so ugly I don't really
like the color of it so I just think
that the white is perfect and it just
looks so much more cozy and makes my
room really feel homey so then next to
my desk I just have this straw basket
that I got from Target and right now
it's just holding my Madewell east-west
tote and that I think there's like a few
Lululemon bags under there just some
things that I like to throw in there
that don't really have a place and I
don't really want them to just like be
on the floor I am ordering a big comfy
blanket that's gonna go in there that I
can also use as like a throw on top of
my bed so I am so excited for that to
come in and obviously this is just my
macbook computer that I use for all my
school work it has this gold case on it
from Amazon I love that then going over
here I have this mirror that kind of
like attaches to my door and it is gold
you guys know gold is my aesthetic
golden white and then it just hangs on
my door I got this from Target and then
opening up my closet I have these two
doors and they just open up wide like
this my closet drawers just open up like
that this is what the inside of my
closet looks like on the top shelf I
just have these two baskets that have
like sports bras and underwear up there
I have my jeans in this little cubby up
here and then in this middle one I just
have a little Gucci box that has like my
belt in it and stuff and then I have all
my baseball hats and then over here I
have a big bag with Lululemon bags in it
and then I have all my towels and stuff
in that one and then I have some skirts
and shorts over here and as you can see
my closet is color-coordinated so I just
have all my whites grays reds blues
Green's blacks and then all of my
jackets right here and then down at the
bottom I just have a box of like
miscellaneous items over there and that
is my laundry basket thing I don't know
where it's from it's my mom's I took it
from my house then I just have this
plastic container thing that I use in my
dorm freshman year and it just has like
all sorts of my Lululemon clothes this
has a bunch of sweatshirts and then that
bottom one has sweatshirts as well and
that thing is from Target it's just one
of their like really cheap dorm item
thingies so I think that was perfect to
use in my closet then on the back of my
first door I just have all of my bags
hanging on this hook I have like my
everyday bags right here and then on the
bottom my Lou Vuitton duffel bag and on
this side I just have this shoe rack
that I also got from Target and it just
has all of my shoes on it so my sneakers
my sandals my heels things like that
right there and I think this is super
helpful because I used to never know
where to put all my shoes they would
honestly just be in baskets or the boxes
and I just thought that the boxes would
take up so much room because my closet
is kind of small so yeah that's what my
closet looks like
but I just thought that I would give you
guys a little room tour and hope that
you guys enjoyed it and if you have any
questions on where things are from I
know I tried to say everything but if
you have any questions just leave them
all down below I will try my best to
link everything that I talked about I
will definitely be linking my perfume
that is on my Alex drawer it's my
absolute favorite so yeah thank you guys
so much for watching this little tour of
my room and I will see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
