today's video has been so highly
requested and I am going to share with
you guys my Lululemon collection as
you're gonna see as like a trend in this
video is that I like a lot of the same
things from Lululemon so when I find an
item that I like I will get it in
multiple different colors and stuff like
that so if I find something that I like
I'm just gonna stick with it I don't
really like to try new things when it
comes to Lululemon items I just know
what I like and I know that that I like
the way that these items fit though I do
have a lot of the same items just in
different colors just to let you guys
know yeah without further ado let's get
started first I'm gonna start off with
tops and sports bras because I don't
have a lot of these from Lululemon
personally I don't like the way that
their tops and sports bras fit me I just
would rather wear like a regular sports
bra from TJ Maxx or just a regular tank
top when I workout at the gym so to
start off I have one sports bar from
Lululemon it is this white one with the
crisscross back it just looks like this
and it does go down a lot lower on your
chest as you can see on the bottom here
which I really like wouldn't you wear
this with like high-waisted
leggings or something I just like how
you can kind of wear it as like a little
bra top and going into tank tops I just
have this cropped tank top right here
it's kind of in a heathered gray color
and the back just Criss crosses like
that and it's all open and this is a
size 4 the next things up that I have is
just this app to Street take top in this
mint green color this has a built in bra
and then on the back it just kind of
goes into a Y shape almost this top is
in a size 4 this is probably one of my
favorite tank tops that 1/2 Lululemon
I've had this one for such a long time
and I just like to wear this one when I
like go on runs and things like that but
again I don't really wear Lululemon tank
tops but if I did this one would have to
be one of my favorite next I just have
these same upto Street tipped off in
this gray color looks the same on the
back and this one as well is in a size 4
and finally
my last tank top is just this one with
this built-in bra on the back it has a
crisscross and if you can see it that
well but it's just this crisscross
detailing on the bra and then the front
is normal in the back as you can see
underneath just swoops low right and
it'll show like an opening in your back
personally I have not ever I think I've
worn this tank top maybe two times but I
don't wear tank tops from tank tops from
Lululemon that much so that's why I
haven't really worn it but yeah so I
have this one and next just going into
the shorts that I have from Lululemon I
have the speed shorts and a bunch of
different colors so I have this white
pair right here and they just have a
zipper pocket in the back these are just
their typical running shorts all of the
speed shorts that I have are in a size 6
normally I wear a size 4 Lululemon but I
do size up for the shorts just because
these ones are three inches so they do
run a little bit shorter and I have this
bright neon orange pair right here and
again they just look the same in the
back like that then I just have a plain
black pair of speech or it's obviously
you have to have a plain black pair of
workout shorts in your closet it's a
must
that's just what they look like in the
back of the same I think these speed
shorts were actually one of my first
pairs that I ever got I think I was in
like eighth grade I've had these for so
long and just third these gray pair with
this band that is just gray and white
stripes look like that I also have a
pair of red speed shorts that I'm
wearing right now but they are just
regular red they look like all the pairs
of shorts that I just showed you before
and finally the last pair of shorts that
I have are just these Hani hot shorts I
believe that these are the longer ones
so they aren't as short as a hottie hot
short short ones and these are different
they have a drawstring in the front and
then in the back the pocket isn't on the
waistband it's on the butt right here
and then that just has this mesh
detailing up the sides which I like and
what I like about these is that they do
have the drawstring I just think it adds
a little bit of something to your shorts
and not just as play
as the other ones I just showed you then
I just have two different types of
jackets from Lululemon the first one is
this white bomber jacket I recently got
this I think at the beginning of the
summer this is in a size 4 and it's just
this really lightweight material this
jacket I think is perfect just to throw
on during the spring summer fall like
when I'm going to class and like running
around and doing errands and things like
that when it's not that cold up yet so
it's just a perfect lightweight jacket
which I love and then I also have the
signature scuba hoodie from Lululemon
it's just this sweatshirt zip up right
here and it has a big hood with their
little logo on the front there this
sweatshirt I believe is in a size 6 I
did size up in it just so it could fit
me a little bit better and I didn't feel
so snug I kind of liked it to be a
little bit oversized so this sweater is
super warm I highly recommend it for the
fall and winter you can wear with a pair
of leggings and a Lululemon scarf
anything like that but I really love
this and I love the gray color as well
so you can see it's kind of a heathered
gray which gives it kind of just like a
fun little detail instead of being
something so plain so I love this
sweater I highly recommend these and now
going into the biggest category of
things that I have from Lululemon and
that is pants I'm gonna start off with
these black joggers right here they're
kind of in this lightweight swishy
material and they have a drawstring on
the waist and obviously go down in there
tight at the ankle these I got any size
6 and I just like them because they're
super lightweight and they're easy to
throw them with a pair of slides and a
tank top and just go over run errands or
run around do things like that so I love
these joggers the next pair of pants
that I have from Lululemon are just the
run inspire crops I have them in this
gray and white striped color and they
just go down and hit about like your
calf area and these have a little zipper
on the back just to put like your cards
or a key and when you go for a run so I
have them in this great white color I
also have these theme run inspire crops
in this gray and red
and I love these I really really really
love red so these ones are probably one
of my favorites and they just have the
little red detailing on the ends here
and they fit exactly the same as a grand
white ones the next pair of crops that I
have from Lululemon are just these pace
rival crops and these kind of have a
cool little ruffle detailing on the end
and these have two pockets on either
side as well as the zipper on the back
these are size four and the material is
the luxe dream on the same as the run
inspired crops that I was just talking
about so that's they're kind of
lightweight running material which is
really good for any high-intensity
working out or doing any activity that
where you know that you're gonna be
sweating a lot these are perfect for
that and finally I just have two pairs
of the speed tights and I have them both
obviously in just a plain black and
these tights go all the way down they
are full length and they kind of bunch
up at the bottom a little bit just
because they are not ankle pants and
these pants are perfect for doing any
high-intensity working out and going on
runs things like that personally I
really like to wear these pants when it
is snowing out and I'm going to class I
wear them with my Sorel snow boots and
just like a long jacket I think that
these ones are perfect they keep you
super warm which I like and again they
just have two side pockets and then this
pair right here has a zipper on the back
because it does not have zippers on the
side like my other pair their pockets on
the side are gesture like this
I think these pair of Lululemon's have
to be my favorite of all time right now
and I don't know the name of them but I
will have all of them linked down below
and they are just these red pair of
Lululemon's with a lighter red stripe
down the side and the band looks like
this
it says Lululemon all the way around it
which i think is really cool and these
are perfect because they're super high
waisted they really suck you in and just
like make you look amazing I swear to
god these pants aren't so amazing if you
saw my workout routine video um these
are the pants that I'm wearing in that
video so I really really really love
these
and I know that I got these any size
four and finally the moment that you've
all been waiting for these pants that
I'm about to talk about are my Holy
Grails they're my favorite Lululemon
pants ever trust me I got my first pair
and I put them on my body and I was like
are you serious like these aren't the
most comfortable pair of leggings that
I've ever put on they are so high
waisted they really suck you in they
lift your butt they make you look
amazing
the material is so thin it makes you
literally feel like you are naked and
you are not wearing anything at all and
yeah so I have them in I think one two
three four five six I have six different
pairs right here because that is how
obsessed I am with them so that is the
Lululemon align pants they are my
all-time favorite I love them so much I
personally wear a size four and the
align pants and I have them in this
eggplant purple color right here which I
love I think this color is so fun then I
have them in this midnight navy blue
color CH I also love I think this color
is so different I've never really owned
a pair of leggings in this color so I
think it was really great to have these
I was so happy when I picked these up
then I have them in this army green
color which I also love I just got this
pair the other day and they are just
kind of this slate like grey blue color
and they just look like that I'm really
excited to wear these I haven't been
able to wear them yet because I haven't
worked out in a little bit I've just
been really sick so I've been trying to
rest and like get myself better so next
time I work out I'm definitely gonna be
wearing these and finally I just have
them in black I have two pairs of black
I think black leggings are definitely a
staple that you should have in your
closet so if you're looking for a great
pair of black leggings you should
definitely look into getting the
Lululemon online pants because I promise
you guys you will not regret it you will
thank me later once you put a pair of
lines on your body I swear they are
amazing and you are going to fall in
love with them so that concludes my
