of my fashion favorites and things that

categories like I have one for like
bodysuits bathing suits prom dresses for
all of you high school girls out there
you guys should totally check out my
profile if you are interested so without
further ado let's get started
on my current fashion favorites and if
you guys have been watching my vlogs and
videos for a while you know that I am
like totally about the comfy lifestyle I
literally own one pair of jeans those
Abercrombie jeans that I always wear I
hate wearing jeans like I just want to
be comfy all the time so that's like my
vibe so everything you guys are gonna
see in this video go along those lines
like the comfy athleisure street style
vibe so the first thing that I wanted to
talk about is this jacket that I've been
wearing every single day since I got it
it is just this black aloe bomber jacket
I got it in a size small and it is kind
of just shiny and it has this really
cool metallic e silver zipper and it is
a little bit shorter and it fits really
really well and I wear this almost every
single day when it's not like that cold
out and I have to wear like my winter
jacket this is perfect it's definitely a
staple it is black so it goes with
everything I used to have like a Free
People bomber jacket that I loved but it
didn't go with everything so once I got
this one I was like yes I know that this
for sure it's gonna be one of my
favorites I've been absolutely loving it
and wearing it a ton lately and the
second thing I wanted to talk about
actually isn't even mine I don't own
this this is Emma's and she's gonna
watch this video and be like I want my
sweater back
but it's this brandy melville charcoal
grey cropped sweatshirt and I
accidentally took this home from
California ended up in my bag but I wear
it every single day whenever I go home
and go in Emma's closet to try to wear
something I always pick this out it's
just a plain cropped crewneck sweatshirt
goes with everything it's my absolute
favorite I love it love it love it it
just fits so well on the right places
the arms are long enough it's super soft
it's so comfy so yes mi will give this
back to you but it's my favorite right
now so you're gonna have to wait a
little while and the next item you guys
already know that these are my favorites
but the Lululemon aligns I just recently
got this color you will see in my
Lululemon haul and I'm gonna be doing
soon but it's kind of like a mauve like
pink color and they are the softest
leggings ever they have a naked
sensation so they make you feel like
you're not wearing anything and they're
super super super high rise so they
really just like suck everything in and
I love the lines I swear I have like 12
or 13 pairs of them and I wear them
every single day like with all my
outfits and I just want to share this
color with you guys because I think that
it is so cool and so different and I
really like wearing like a color pair of
leggings with like sneakers and a little
tank top and my jacket so this is
definitely really really good color
right now and my next favorite item is
just this Lululemon sports bra and it's
just plain black with a little
crisscross in the back I think it's
called their I don't know what it's
called
I love this sports bra because of how
low it goes on the bottom if you guys
can see it has like a really thick fan
so it fits kind of like a little shirt
in it I don't know just for me like
since I don't really have boobs it fits
me really well and I really like the way
it looks and I can wear high waisted
leggings with it and wear it as a top so
this is definitely my favorite right now
I wear this to the gym all the time I
just got a red one the other day and
then I recently just ordered another one
online because I'm so obsessed with them
so if you guys are looking for like a
good top like athleisure top or sports
bra you guys should totally check this
one out I have been absolutely loving it
lately and then I just have two tops to
share with you guys and the first one is
this black plain cropped tank top from
forever 21 I think it was like $5 and
honestly I was talking about about it
the other day I feel like the best items
that I have in my favorite items in my
closet are always the ones that were
really cheap and that I didn't spend a
lot of money I'm like this thing was
five dollars I wear it all the time
it's just a plain black crop tank top it
fits really well and yeah and the next
top is just this other black crop tank
top and this one's from brandy melville
and this one also fits really really
well too I like how the straps are a
little bit thinner on this one and these
two tank tops I may absolutely favor and
I like wearing them with leggings my alo
jacket and I'll wear sneakers with them
and it just makes like the perfect
outfit for me I feel like I like wearing
stuff that's like neutral and you can
wear in many different ways like you
could wear one of these tank tops with a
pair of ripped boyfriend jeans and it
would look so good or you can wear
leggings you wear with shorts whatever
or even joggers so I just feel like I
like staples I like to have a lot of
staples in my claws I just feel like for
me like I get the most use out of them
and really get my money's worth because
I know that if I buy like one really
cute expensive thing I'm gonna wear it
once and then get over it so I've
learned that it's just really not worth
it and some of the best items that you
get end up being the cheap ones like
from forever 21 and stuff that you could
wear all the time and the last little
top I wanted to talk about is just this
little cropped bralette top from Urban
Outfitters and it's white and then has
this little grey band on the bottom I
just think that it's so comfy and these
dainty straps are so cute especially
when you
like a little tan for me self-tanner
during the window you guys know I'm
obsessed with self-tanner but I just
think that this top is so cute and it's
so my vibe right now and I really really
really like it
you guys should totally check them out
I'll have them linked down below like I
said they have a bunch of different
colors and styles and stuff so yeah and
my next favorite pair of pants you guys
already know my brand new sweat pants
though just the light grey ones and they
have this drawstring band right there
I'm obsessed with these I literally have
no words you guys know I wear them all
the time they're so comfy I love wearing
them to class it's like one of my little
tank tops and my a low jacket and then
pair of sneakers that's my five that's
what I wear you guys know I love them so
I'm not gonna sit here and rant about
them you need them in your life and a
story you need them okay and that was it
for the close part of this video now
going into some accessories I've been
loving my red la hat you guys know I
love my blue la half before used to wear
it every single day but now I got the
red one because red is my favorite color
right nails are red phone cases red I
love red so I usually wear this hat
every single day like when I go to class
or if I'm just like going out on a bail
need to throw something on I don't
really have any makeup on or don't want
to do my hair I will usually just put my
hair in a little bun and then wear my LA
hat so this is my absolute favorite hat
at the moment I've also been loving
these little Lululemon scrunchies I have
this black and silver kind of little
crackles one I have a army green one and
a white one and I don't wear these in my
hair because my hair is so soft and
straight that it actually looks really
weird but I love wearing them on my
wrist as a little accessory so if I'm
wearing like my Apple watch I'll just
put one on my wrist like what I'm
wearing workout clothes cuz I don't I
just feel like it makes my outfits look
a lot cuter since I don't really dress
up and I think these are like $8 at
Lululemon they're really not that
expensive and I just like to wear them
like on my wrists they look super cute
and another thing I've been loving right
now are just these little dainty gold
hoop earrings and these are like kind of
hexagon ish and they're from forever 21
and I just love them like when I go out
just to dress up my outfit a little
but these have been my absolute favorite
I wear them out all the time so I just
think that if you wear like a dainty
cute little pair of earrings that can
definitely dress up any outfit so these
ones are my favorite now they weren't
expensive at all they were probably like
four dollars and if you guys are looking
for ways to dress up your outfits when
you go out I definitely recommend
getting like a cute pair of dainty
earrings that you can wear just to like
spice things up a little bit last but
not least my last favorite at the moment
is my made well black bucket transport
tote thingy and it just has this long
strap and then two little straps hanging
off of it and it is my favorite shoulder
bag at the moment I use it when I go to
class it fits so much stuff it fits my
notebook my computer a water bottle
sunglasses gum literally everything if
you guys want to see like what's in my
bag video just give this video a thumbs
up I've been so obsessed with that bag
lately and another thing I realized the
other day was that they have the same
one on dough and it's actually from
forever 21 so it looks exactly like it
but it's also not like $170 it's like 24
and I saved the bag to my little bag
category on my do't profile you guys
should totally check it out because it
is the best dupe that I found to this
bag if you're not looking to spend a ton
of money but you still want the same
look you can get it from forever 21 that
is what I've noticed a lot lately with
forever 21 they've been coming out with
like so many things that are dupes of
like three people's stuff and Urban
Outfitters and all of these more
expensive brands they're coming up with
it and it's so much cheaper more
affordable so definitely forever 21 has
to be my favorite store at the moment so
that concludes my current fashion
favorite city I hope that you guys
enjoyed it again I will have all of
these items linked down below for you
