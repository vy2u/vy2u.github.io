today's video I am going to be showing
you a bunch of new glasses that I
recently just got as you guys know I do
wear eyeglasses I cannot see far away at
all
I don't wear contacts I hate them I
don't like the feeling putting them in
my eyes I just really don't like them so
I am a glasses person whether it may be
the eyeglasses that I have to wear or
sunglasses I think that glasses are an
amazing accessory and all of the glasses
I will be showing you in today's video
are from a glasses usa.com glasses USA
offers over 4,000 different styles of
glasses whether it be sunglasses
eyeglasses they have their in-house
brands like muse and amelia ii and they
also have so many different high-end
brands like Ray Ban Gucci Armani so many
different ones they have so many
different styles to choose from you guys
can literally find any type of pair of
glasses you are looking for on glasses
usa.com
something so amazing that they add is
that you can add your prescription to
almost any of the different style frames
that they offer and what's even better
is that any pair of glasses including
the frames and lenses starts at only $30
and free basic prescription lenses are
included with every frame and another
thing that really stood out to me about
glasses usa.com is that they offer free
shipping and free returns on every order
and you also get a hundred percent of
money back guaranteed if you are not
happy with your glasses you can return
them up to 14 days for a hundred percent
of your money back guaranteed and they
don't ask any questions I think that
that's so great just in case you get
them in the mail and you don't like them
and they weren't what you thought they
do a guarantee getting your money back
and they think that is such a great
thing to have and you also get 365 days
of product warranty and they also have
such a cool feature on their website
I'll show you right now if you guys
don't know which glasses you think will
look good on you and you're just like
unsure about how they're gonna fit your
face you can actually try them on with
their virtual Tryon mirror and what you
do is you just take a photo of yourself
and once you upload the photo of
yourself you can actually see what the
glasses look like directly on
face so it makes it so much easier when
you're going to pick out your perfect
frame and you guys can check out glasses
