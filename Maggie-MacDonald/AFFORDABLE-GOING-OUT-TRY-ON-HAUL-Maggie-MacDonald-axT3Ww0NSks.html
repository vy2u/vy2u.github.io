you're new here my name is Maggie
you should totally subscribe to my
channel I will be making a ton of
fashion beauty videos that is what I
live for if you guys are into like the
comfy cute athleisure chic trendy look
that's my vibe um I don't know I just
like want to sit down and show you guys
another haul I have a shopping problem
you guys know but today's haul is so
different I've been so excited to show
you guys I cannot believe that it is
already December and I'm finally 21 so
that means I can legally go to a bar now
so I was like you know what I'm gonna be
go to the bar so I just picked up a ton
of stuff affordable going out clothes
and I am so excited to share them with
you all I love going to forever 21 for
going out clothes I just think that
they're so trendy and so affordable and
they really give you like that look that
you're going for when you're going out
and also it's not gonna put a dent in
your wallet for all of you college girls
out there so I have a ton of cute stuff
to show you guys I'm super excited and
without further ado let's get started
the first thing that I picked up from
forever 21 this I'm gonna save these for
the summer but I was like you know what
they're so cute I have to have them
they're just these cream I think I think
they call them paper bag pants because
they have like this high waist and they
tie in the front and they are so cute
and they kind of just go down they're
not tight at the ankle they're just like
loose all around I think that these are
gonna look so cute with like a cream
bodysuit or like a little Bindo top but
I'm so excited I'm definitely gonna be
saving these for summer I thought that
they were super cute the next item I
picked up from forever 21 is just this
sports bra I'm obsessed with forever 21
sports bras if you guys saw my workout
routine video the other day I talked
about how I love their sports files and
I have to take this one up it was so
cheap and it's just plain black it has
crisscross detailing in the back so I am
so excited that I got this and the next
item I picked up from forever 21 is just
this black crew neck cropped sweatshirt
and I wear cropped sweatshirts and
t-shirts every single day to class with
like sneakers and leggings I don't like
to dress off like totally brain jeans I
just like wearing cropped things with
like high-rise leggings so I picked this
one up it was super cheap and I think
that this is just a really nice staple
to have in your closet okay aside from
all those things that I got those are
just a few staple pieces that I picked
up and moving into the going out clothes
first I just picked up this metallic e
shear cropped long-sleeve shirt these
are very trendy right now and I think
that this is super cute to wear like a
black bra that underneath with like a
black leather skirt and some black
booties I think that this is so cute I
love this look right now and I think
that it is super cute and sexy when
going out the next item I picked up is
just this cropped of metallic tank top
it is black and I think it is silver
metallic in it I don't know what's up
with me and metallic right now but I
picked up this tank top I think it's
super cute to pair with anything you can
wear it with jeans and like a really
statement belt you can wear it with big
pants with like big flared bottoms you
can wear it with like a skirt literally
anything I think that this was so cute
and just a perfect piece to have in your
closet you can easily just throw it on
and pair it with anything the next item
I got are just these gray I think it's a
grayish black and they're these long
pants with these bell-bottoms and I
don't think that they go all the way
down to the ground I think that they
stop about at like your calf area I wore
a pair like this on my birthday if you
guys saw my 21st birthday Instagram I
was wearing silver ones I got from naked
oh my god they're amazing so I was like
you know what I need another pair just
like it so I'm not gonna get like
something too flashy like those ones
where I'm just gonna pick up a plain
pair I think that these are so cute and
effortless just to wear with like a
cropped shirt and a pair of dainty heels
like the ones with the little strap and
the strap around your ankle I think that
these are so cute and they were so cheap
$14 guys like you cannot beat that the
next item I picked up is this maroon
leather skirt it is high-waisted which I
like it just really sucks you in in the
right place
is and it has a little zipper in the
back I'm gonna be wearing this a ton I
know with body suits and booties the
next item I got is another skirt this
one is just plain black and it has some
silver detailing with the zippers I am
gonna pair this with like black body
suits black tops I think that a little
mini black skirt is definitely a staple
for going out that you should have in
your closet then I got a plain black
bodysuit and this one is just black and
ribbed and it is kind of like a tank top
bodysuit this one is definitely so
practical to have because I don't know I
just feel like you cannot go wrong with
one of these wear high-waisted jeans in
like a little biker jacket this is
absolutely perfect and plus I love the
look of body suits because they are
tucked in obviously to your pants and it
just gives you like a really sleek look
if you guys know what I mean then I
picked up another bodysuit just this
white one with these little dainty
spaghetti straps I feel like this is
just obviously like I was saying before
perfect to wear with jeans and a jacket
you can wear with a skirt you can wear
with anything I think that body suits
are perfect to have typically I would
rather our body suit than a regular
shirt just because it is tucked in it is
all one piece so I think it's a lot more
comfortable from me at least so yeah I
love this one I just think that it is a
perfect staple to have I keep saying
that but really all these items are
staples so that concludes my affordable
forever 21 clothing haul I hope you guys
