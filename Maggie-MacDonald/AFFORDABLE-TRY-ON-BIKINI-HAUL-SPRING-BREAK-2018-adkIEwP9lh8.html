today's video has been so highly
requested as you can see it by the title
I'm gonna be doing a huge try on bikini
haul and all of the bikinis that I'm
going to be showing you today are from
the online clothing stores awful and if
you don't know what's awful is they are
an online store that has a bunch of
different clothing accessories and
bikinis and they're super cute and
trendy and also very affordable and I
will have all of these bathing suits
linked down below for you guys it's also
something that's really great on their
website is that they have free shipping
on all orders over $30 to anywhere
around the world which i think is so
great and so without further ado let's
get started I have so many bathing suits
to show you guys but the first one I'm
gonna start off with today is just this
plain black one and this is what the top
looks like right here it just has these
two little knots right there in the
front kind of like on your collarbone
area and it is like kind of sports bra
tight and I got this one in a size small
it is the only bikini that I got in a
size small out of all the ones that I'm
gonna be showing you guys today and just
for reference I am a 34b on the top and
then on the bottom I wear like a size 26
or 27 or size four or two but for
reference I'm a four and Lululemon
aligns so just to give you kind of an
idea if you're looking to order any
bikinis for example but this is what the
bottoms look like they're just these
really cheeky they literally look like a
song but for me I personally only like
to wear bikinis that are more cheeky and
kind of like a thong because like my
butt is like bigger and bikinis that
like have full coverage don't really fit
me that well and they really look awful
so I really need it to be cheeky or like
a song so when I was buying all these
bikinis off of saffle I actually typed
in like at the top I literally typed in
funky knee and then just bought all the
ones that were song but they have some
ones on there that definitely aren't and
they don't only sell sell ones that are
like cheeky and thongs so if that's not
like your vibe or your look that's
totally ok they have bathing suits on
there that aren't as cheeky and like are
more conservative and the second bathing
suit I got is just this black one and
the top looks like this it's one
shoulder and then kind of
like a bandeau on the bottom and it has
built-in cups which is really really
nice just to like kind of keep the shape
in the form of the top which I really
liked
and then these bottoms are also cheeky
and they are just string on the sides
and really really thin which I really
love these are my favorite kind of
bottoms ever just because I don't like
having really thick tan lines so these
ones are super good for tanning and also
the material is really really stretchy
and soft and I don't know I really like
them
and this next bathing suit I got is this
white one and it just has thick straps
and it looks like a sports bra and the
material is kind of like ribbed and
ruched or however you say it but I
really like this one and these are the
bottoms they are just plain white and
they match the top I got this in a size
medium but I definitely could have gone
down a size and do a small just because
the top was kind of big on me and it
kind of was loose fitted so if you want
to get this one I would recommend sizing
down in it and then I just got this
plain white bikini and the top has
little triangles and then the back is
very dainty and just has a little clasp
and adjustable straps which I love and
there are built-in pads in this one also
and the bottoms are the same ribbed
white material and they are just very
very cheeky and plain white I really
love this bathing suit I definitely
think that it's gonna be a staple this
summer it's my absolute favorite right
now I cannot wait to wear it I am
obsessed with this next bathing suit
that I got the color is like a
Cinderella blue I love it it's just this
plain blue ribbed bottom and it comes
with a matching triangle top and the top
has a little clasp on the back and also
adjustable straps which I really like
and I think is definitely a must for me
when looking for a bathing suit but I
just think that this color is so good
but I just think that this color is so
nice and it definitely looks really good
on you and you have a nice tan and I
have an owned a bathing suit that is
this color so I'm so excited to finally
have one and I can't wait to wear it oh
my god these bathing suits that I'm
about to show you guys are my absolute
favorite of all time my favorite style
unthoughtful and I think they're $12 I'm
not even kidding
I ordered two of these for spring break
when I went with Kaylee to Miami and you
would have seen on my Instagram and my
snapchat I had I've read
I'm string bikini and then also a
matching hot pink string bikini I'll
insert a photo right here so you guys
can look and see what they looked like
but I have to get those bathing suits in
of course more colors because I was so
obsessed with the way that they fit so I
just got this army green one and usually
I don't like this color on me but I
don't know I really like the bathing
suit version and it's just plain string
with little triangle top and then the
bottoms are the same kind of thin on the
sides and that really nice soft material
as I showed you not black off the
shoulder one that I also had so I got it
in an army green color I also picked it
up in plain black you guys know plain
black is just mustard your closet black
looks good on everybody it's just such a
slimming color and I really really liked
it and I didn't own a plain black bikini
before believe it or not so it was
really nice to get this one I think it's
super cute and then last but not least I
picked it up in this plum purpley color
and I don't like purple purple is my
least favorite color ever but this one's
actually kind of more like cranberry and
I really like it and it's just again
that string top and the plane bottoms
with the little thinner detailing on the
sides and then I got this plain red
bikini and this is the top it just has a
little tie in the front and then just
goes straight across and down in the
back and I own this bikini already in
white and I wore it when I was in
California back in January but I really
really like this one I wore this one of
the days when I was in Miami with
Gretchen Lucy and Emma and I was getting
so many questions about wear the bathing
suit was from but I didn't answer any of
them because I just want to wait and
show you guys in this haul so this is it
and it is just plain red and then the
bottoms are super cute I really like
them because they are cheeky and then
they have this little ruffle detailing
on the back which i think is super cute
but I picked this up in size medium and
the one that I had in California was a
size small and I will insert a photo
right here of it I wore it when I was in
California you guys were obsessed with
it and I had that one in the small and I
just decided to size up and it
Sam just because the bottoms are a
little bit tight on me last time so
definitely I would recommend getting a
size medium and this if you are the same
size with me then I just got a plain
white bikini that has a little triangle
detailing on the front and then a little
clasp in the back and adjustable straps
then it also comes with the same bottoms
as I have been showing you guys before
just the plain ones with the little thin
detailing on the sides this bikini is
just plain white you can never go wrong
honestly with a plain white bikini and
it was super cheap so I was like you
know what I feel like my boy bikinis get
like a little bit dingy and like dirty
the more you wear them during the summer
so I was like you can never have too
many with bikinis because like I know
tanning oil and like sunscreen and all
that is gonna make them a lot like more
discolored so I decided to just pick up
another plain way bikini and the same as
the one I just showed you guys I also
got it in this gray color which I really
like this one kind of fits differently
than the white one but I don't know I
just really like the way that it fits
the top and it just has again a little
clasp in the back and adjustable straps
which is a must and I don't know it just
like fits so well on the top and the
bottoms are my absolute favorite I know
I've been talking about them this whole
entire video but they're just the plain
bottoms with the little thin straps on
the side and I didn't own a gray bikini
before so I'm so glad that I picked up
this color I think it's gonna look super
good this summer and next I also got
another great bikini but this one is a
little bit different than the one I just
showed you the padding on the boobs is
really kind of thicker and the detailing
on the back is gold which I like because
I love gold and I definitely could have
gotten this in a size small but I did
get any medium it still fits really well
but it is a bit loose on the top and
then again the bottoms just looked the
same as the ones that I have been
showing you throughout this whole entire
video I really like these bottoms so I'm
so excited that I got that one and last
but not least I know all of the bikinis
that I've showed you guys throughout
this whole entire haul have been like
plain solid bikinis because that's more
my vibe like you can't go wrong with a
solid colored bikini so I decided to
branch out a little bit and get
something a little bit more fun and I
got this
doh bikini top and it's kind of like a
Dalmatian print it has a little spots
all over it and it is black and white
you can't really tell on the camera but
black and white little bando top and
then it came with these really thick
cheeky bottoms which I like these are
super cute I'm so excited to wear this
bathing suit it fits so well I was a
little bit worried about the bando and
seeing if it was gonna like stay up on
me and all of that but if it's really
well and I think it's perfect for
tanning just to like get rid of all of
your likes trapped in lines I think I
still have mine from Miami yeah a little
bit but you know like if you're wearing
it strapless things in the summer you
don't always want your bathing suit like
tan lines to show so it's always nice to
have a strapless bikini in your
collection so that concludes this Tryon
bikini haul I hope that you guys enjoyed
this video and give this video a thumbs
up if you liked it and want to see more
of these or want to see like a bikini
