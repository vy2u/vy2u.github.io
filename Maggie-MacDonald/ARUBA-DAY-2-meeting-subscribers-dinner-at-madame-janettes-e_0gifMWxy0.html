bikinis to that you guys are gonna see
my is black
my nose is white we're liking yin and
yang is that how you say yin and yang
yeah like in 88 today but all of our
bikinis by the way I don't know if I
said this in yesterday's vlog we're
gonna be making a whole entire like a
rubra bikini haul video just to make it
so easy for you guys um with the exact
links trying them on telling you like
how they fit and everything so we're
gonna be doing that that'll be up on our
channel soon we just have to film it
obviously we're gonna do it here since
this is where we're wearing all the
bikinis but I walked off the side this
morning and I was like wait it doesn't
look that nice out cuz it's kind of
cloudy but then you have to remember
eight o'clock and it float my camera's
like getting fogged up because I just
walked outside and it's like really hot
out but look how nice it is sorry my
camera's so far let me fix that that
better
so right now like I just said we're
gonna go down and get some coffee and I
really need to clean off this camera
screen my god if someone was in a rush
this morning my shirts on backwards but
oh my god it the line is so long this
morning
I'm of logging I'm having a spinach and
tomato omelette like yesterday and some
grapefruit and then also I got a piece
of french toast and I put a little bit
of cinnamon and powdered sugar on it
just as if you know me you know that I
love french toast and I took pictures
this morning like we went down and
checked them just before and yeah so
then we were going to come eat breakfast
like we did yesterday dinner between me
table in the comparison to the back of
the room and had to give this on the
shirt that I got from pretty little
thing and I just put on a little tank
top and I know there's pretty little
thing over there is my favorite cause
it's already good that's already cut up
it's so fresh everything on the island
is so fresh I love it I love you here I
really can't wait to come back
the people on the island are so cute
look at them they're so happy I wish it
was my birthday at the beach which is
right in front of the water this is
where Emma and I like just sit so pretty
today
oh and also I really need to be careful
flogging because I have my tripod just
because I feel like it stabilizes the
vlog better and they know when a vlog a
couple weeks go you guys really
complaining that and yesterday it was so
high that where I was using my tripod my
camera like got stuck to and I went onto
a stitch like charge my battery after
and I leave that off so I really need to
be careful today like with my camera and
they try bunch of being in the Sun but
my hair so we set up this little area
between both of our chairs and we like
put a towel kind of like a little
hammock and then we put our bags in it
because like gusts of wind will blow
across and we'll get all sandy and like
sand will get in our bags and like on
our phone and I brought my speaker and
stuff so we just like didn't want our
cameras or anything to get ruined so we
set up this little hammock thing and
it's kind of cool it like actually
really works
we got our own special much we ordered
it from the restaurant up there that we
thought it was so good we saw the lunch
menu we were like yeah we need that so
we got Mediterranean hummus wrap well
they look so yummy
here's your exam so guys I just met
Carly and she's trying new jersey and
this is my dad he's never really been
it's their debuts applaud some new
people for you guys to know so we have
Carly and my dad Mike the first time
being for the camera gee I didn't say
anything down all my boxers she's here
in a Rubens RV and her friend told her
that we were here so and then she came
and met up with us and now we're having
so much fun it's so pretty here wow it's
so pretty it's so pretty
some things like really funky and my
camera lens right now but em and I have
to eat because we're going to work out
soon so we just went down to the
Starbucks in the lobby we got the fruit
salad let me open this up and show you
like that looks so good and we also got
banana bread and we got coffee and water
cuz these are our favorites and look how
tan Emma looks I feel like I kind of
look tan but I don't know if you can
like really see me from all the way over
there I'll go a little bit closer this
is what I look like I think I kind of
look tan to actually the Sun here so
strong
and everybody's been asking in my videos
and on my Instagram what I use for like
tanning oil and sunscreen I don't use
tanning oil all I use is the Australian
Gold 30 SPF sunscreen and this is the
spray when I'll have it linked down
below for you guys it's my favorite I
love it and then this is what I use on
my face just the Neutrogena breakout
freely liquid lotion sunscreen and it's
oil free for my eyelash extensions so
those are the two products I use all um
down below and yeah just right now we
don't have any self-tanner on obviously
because we're on vacation I feel like
that would be really stupid to like put
self tanner on and then come to Aruba I
don't know I feel like it would mess
with my head and I would think that I'm
tan so then I wouldn't put on sunscreen
because I think oh my god I'm tan and
then I'd end up getting burnt and I was
like ruin my skin but it's just all
natural baby I got rid of the tripod so
we're gonna see how this works my camera
is kind of funky and this is like the
only mirror in our hotel room and I only
can't go over and stand next week is of
the bed dude it really thinks I'm
assuming legs look good um I'm wearing
this romper from princess Polly to
dinner and we're going to imagine
Jeanette's all obviously bringing you
guys along with and yeah so it's wicked
cute this romper I love it I'll have the
princess Polly Hall link down below I
love their clothes I just feel like

made wow you really see how tan you got

sunkissed read-only you're like pink a
little bit people have been asking where
these bracelets are from they're
actually tennis bracelets so if you live
in Dennis we got one we got them at Eden
in East Ennis and something that's
really interesting
we're mayor of what the Dennis bracelet
is that if you lived in Dennis and a
long time ago back with our mom with in
high school only residents of Dennis
used to be able to get the bracelet so
if you didn't live and Dennis if you
couldn't get them so then they came out
with another one called the Cape Cod
bracelet but if it isn't from Heaton
it's technically a knockoff which if you
have one that's a keep every sin itself
not even you at all what love that but
yeah in order to get these you like have
to get tickets to get something it's
crazy you can't just like walk in and be
like oh I want to get one today you have
to get a ticket you have to wait in line
it's like a little tiny tiny place we
use of Excel like when we were born we
hope we have tiny ones I have two of
them and I'm saving them from when I
have a daughter dad show them yours see

dad and one for the waiter and I'm like
I literally could stomach and I was
looking at the shot a fireball in front
of me and I was like I'm sorry that was
so nice of you but I think you do it and
Emma over here
imagine you taking your first sip of
alcohol and it was a fireball shot even
though you're in a boy like not good
but anyway needless to say we did not
take the fireball shots but there's
really a city like I believe use
fireball in candy yes Emma it's brown
liquor alcohol and it tastes like one of
those red fireball candies it's like if
you put those like in water they
saturate it in alcohol I swear
