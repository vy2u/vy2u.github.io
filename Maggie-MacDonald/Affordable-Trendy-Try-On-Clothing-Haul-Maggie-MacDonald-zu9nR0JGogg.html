today's video I'm gonna be showing you a
ton of new affordable things that I've
got online from forever 21 in this
guided I wanted to share these items
with you all because personally I think
that these are great staples to have in
your closet and they were all extremely
cheap from forever 21 I think I only
spent around $50 and then from misguided
I spent 100 I have so many things to
show you and I'm gonna be trying them on
for you and showing you how they fit how
you can wear them and things like that I
will have the prices for all of these
items on the screen when I show you the
Tryon part so without further ado let's
get started so to start off with
forever21 I got a few bodysuits the
first one I picked up is just this black
one that I'm wearing right now and it is
spaghetti straps and it is just straight
across like this it is a very thin
seamless material but it is extremely
good quality I love this bodysuit I
think that it's perfect if you wear a
pair of high-waisted jeans and I just
think that it can really dress up any
outfit if you're trying to look trendy
and effortless well on a budget
the next bodysuit I picked up from
forever 21 is just this last seamless
one right here and as you can see it
just goes lower in the back there and
these straps are about two finger-tips
widths and I love this bodysuit I think
that it's going to be a staple in my
closet I definitely would wear this
again with a pair of high-waisted
boyfriend jeans and a pair of sneakers
maybe some gold jewelry and cool
sunglasses and I love this bodysuit I
think that it's perfect to have in your
closet it was super affordable and I
recommended this to everybody next I
just got this nude ribbed cami bodysuit
from forever 21 I got this one in a size
medium it just has some ribbed detailing
and again is spaghetti strap it's a nude
color which I love so you
where this with anything I would
probably wear a meeting with Derek
joggers pair of boyfriend jeans sneakers
baseball hat things like best I love
this body food it was super affordable I
think that everybody should have
something like this in the closet this
is gonna be great when I am in a rush
and on the go and just want to wear
something super simple but also looks
very trendy the last item that I got
from forever 21 are a pair of grey
cotton joggers they just look like this
and they have this white band on the top
and then they're just tight on the ends
with a drawstring and a little pocket in
the back I love these I cannot wait to
wear them this weekend when I go on my
trip to Cleveland and I think that these
are so cute to wear with just sneakers a
tank top and a baseball hat they're
super comfortable but they're also very
trendy and cute and these are so so
cheap I know that I've looked at some
online before that were looked just like
this they were close to $100 but these
were only $15 so I highly recommend
these and they're so comfortable and
soft like I wish that you could feel how
soft this is oh my god they're so comfy
I can not wait to wear these next I
picked up three pairs of jeans and a
pair of shorts from misguided the first
pair of jeans that I thought just are
the high-waisted boyfriend jeans with
ripped all the way down and they have a
rock on the bottom which I like I got
these in a size 6 and these are their
high-rise
and the style called riot and these are
just the perfect jeans for if you're
going out you want to dress up an outfit
with a pair of sneakers or sand or
something like that they have this
perfect drips in that I know I've looked
online everywhere for a pair of jeans
that look like this and the rips just go
all the way down the front and they're
not too big which I know some of my
jeans that I've tried on in the past I
had a problem because the rips are too
big and I just don't think from me at
least that that's appropriate what if
I'm wearing them every day I feel like
people kind of give me looks I had this
one pair of jeans from Zara that I loved
but they had rips all down the front and
every time I'd wear them people would
kind of be like okay so I love these
jeans I think that they are a great
piece to have in your closet and the
quality is all right I wouldn't say that
they're my favorite pair of jeans but it
also goes with how much I paid for them
they were not expensive at all so you
kind of get what you pay for with
misguided I think but other than that I
love these jeans and they are amazing
and I cannot wait to wear them the next
pair of jeans that I got from this guy
that are just these high-waisted fray
hemmed jeans and this is in kind of
their medium wash I am so excited to
wear these jeans I love the frayed
detailing on the ends I think that these
are gonna look so cute with a pair of
heels and a nice top to go up to dinner
out one night so I'm so excited to wear
these these are super cheap but they are
also extremely trendy I see people
wearing jeans like this all over the
place and I'm so happy that I got my
hands on a pair of them the last pair of
jeans that I got from misguided are just
these lighter wash ripped jeans again
they are extremely high waisted which I
love I love jeans that are high-waisted
because I feel like they just suck
everything in and if you wear a body
suit with them it looks amazing it's one
of my favorite looks right now these
jeans we're super affordable I love the
look of them
just rip detailing all down the front
with the frayed edges I love love love
that look right now and the last item
that I got from misguided are just these
high recent frayed denim shorts and they
are kind of in a late to mid wash I love
these shorts they're super high-waisted
I love the frayed detailing on the ends
as you can tell that that trend in my
video right now kind of just the
bodysuit look with a lot of denim that's
ripped has phrase I love that the last
item that I got from misguided is just
this white open front bodysuit
personally I think I'm just gonna sell
this on my posh market doesn't really
look that great on me it doesn't fit me
right I think I have too long a torso to
be able to wear it I got this bodysuit
from this guy that because if you spend
over I think it was $200 you got 50% off
your whole order which made me go over
so and then I got everything for a
hundred so I kind of just threw this in
my cart
I didn't really know how it was gonna
fit me but I ended up not fitting me
well which was fine so I think I'm just
gonna resell it but it is super cute I
wish it did fit me better because I feel
like this would look so cute with like a
denim skirt and some sneakers and gold
jewelry I'm really sad that this doesn't
work out for me but I will be selling it
on there Poshmark if you are interested

of like a size small extra small so if
