in honor of the Valentine's Day season I
just thought that I would do a little
like Valentine's Day themed wellness
date video and I'm gonna have a good day
I have a SoulCycle little class planned
for tonight and I'm just gonna go and
show you guys what I'm gonna do today
and in honor of the Valentine's Day
season I just wanted to let you guys
know that you don't need a boyfriend or
relationship or any of that type of
stuff you guys like just go out there
and do stuff for yourself and treat
yourself and like pamper yourself for
today you don't need someone else to do
that because you can go out there and do
it for yourself so I'm gonna have one of
those days for me and I just thought it
would be a lot of fun to bring you guys
along with me and leave a comment down
below and let me know how you are gonna
treat yourself this Valentine's Day so
without further ado let's get started
I'm in my bathroom now and I wanted to
just start off by doing my normal daily
facial routine and so what i'm gonna do
is i'm using this spin brush right here
and then my favorite facial cleanser and
i'm just gonna clean my face to get it
prepped and ready for the day and the
cleanser i use is just the Cetaphil
gentle skin cleanser i love this one you
can get out the drugstore it's my
absolute favorite and the spin brush
that I use is just this one right here
from vanity planet I really really
really like it it comes with four
different brush heads it has this one
right here which is the daily one that I
use every single day just to like
exfoliate my skin every morning and
night and then it also comes with this
one right here which has more firm
bristles and this one is for like every
two to three days it gives you more of a
deeper exfoliation and it also comes
with this a larger brush head which is
really really nice because it is a full
body exfoliator so it will like
exfoliate your body like I use it when I
put on self-tanner just because it's
easier than a mitt and I feel like it's
way more effective and since you can use
the spin brush in the shower it is water
resistant I like to go in there and just
use the larger one on my body just to
get a full exfoliation before I put self
tanner on and then it also comes with
this small pumice stone head just to
click on and you
use it on your feet to get rid of any
calluses and just like clean up your
feet if you don't like it I'm kind of
care that often or anything like that I
think that's really really helpful I
like using a spin brush when I clean my
face just because I feel like it's way
more effective than just cleaning it
with my hands because it really can get
deeper in your pores and it just really
exfoliates and brightens up your skin
and just brings out all of like your
inner glow and it also gets rid of all
of the bacteria in your skin just all
the nasty stuff that you can't reach
when you're just washing your face with
your hands and I think as a result of
that I visibly have clear skin like
right now I'm not wearing any makeup so
this is just what I look like when I am
fresh-faced and I feel like using Aspen
brusha has really made my skin just feel
a lot like smoother and brighter just
because it is getting rid of all of the
imperfections and impurities that were
there when I was just washing my face
like regularly with my hands so I just
wanted to get my face a little bit damp
before I go in with my cleanser so I'm
just gonna take one a pump of that right
on my brush and then start exfoliating
and I just hold it in my hand and move
it around I don't really put that much
pressure on it and I really like
exfoliating just because it removes all
of the dead skin cells from the surface
of my skin and this really keeps my
pores from clogging and I feel like it
just prevents a lot of breakouts and
like blemishes from coming out like
blackheads whiteheads all that nasty
stuff and it really just increases your
blood circulation and just allows you to
have way more radiant skin and before I
rinse my face I just wanted to show you
guys with a brush head because look at
that see it's not perfectly white
anymore so I'm gonna rinse that off at
least I know that my face is getting
clean because I can clearly see that
there was still a little bit of makeup
to probably mix the self-tanner which is
disgusting and it wouldn't have came off
if I just used my hands and wash my face
so I'm gonna go ahead and rinse my face
and then we will start prepping for
makeup and now that my face is all
prepped I am going to just put a little
bit of moisturizer on just to hydrate
skin before putting any makeup on and I
have a special offer for you guys if you
want to get your own vanity planet spin
brush you can use in the Codex full a
date for 70% off your purchase which is
absolutely amazing so I will have the
link to the vanity planner website down
below in the description and also the
code that you guys can use to get a
brush of your own and they are cruelty
free which is absolutely amazing now I'm
just gonna put on a tiny bit of makeup
I'm gonna start off by just using some
Burt's Bees chapstick to hydrate a
little bit then I'm gonna be using some
of the Too Faced hangover primer just to
hydrate my skin before putting on some
bronzer I'm only doing bronzer today
just like a really really light look and
it's so important to at least put on a
little bit of primer just because you
don't want the makeup just going
directly on your face and I feel like it
helps the powder set so much more so I'm
just taking my benefit hoola bronzer you
guys know this one's my favorite and
then just taking this big Real
Techniques fluffy brush that has a hair
on it now it's in my eye and flew off it
all around just giving my face a little
bit more warmth and warming it up a
little bit just because it is winter so
your girl needs a little bit of color so
now I'm just gonna take my Tarte blush
right not my little cheeks a little bit
this one is in the shade party I use it
in almost all of my makeup tutorials and
I just want to give myself a little rosy
glow on my cheeks so finishing touch
always always always highlight my face
and I'm going to be using this Too Faced
love light highlighter and it is in the
shade ray of light so I'm just gonna go
ahead and add a little bit to my cheeks
and the tip of my nose and my Cupid's
bow just to give myself a little glow
and so that is my makeup makeup for
today I just wanted to give myself a
little something and now I'm probably
just gonna put a hat on and get started
with my day
it's so warm today I need to check what
the weather actually is it's 44 degrees
that's crazy and it's February usually
here it's like it's freezing and it's
been so so so cold for the past a couple
of weeks so I'm glad that we finally
have like a warm day and I just realized
that I need to clean my car so I might
do that today just because it's all
gross and nasty from all the salts and
stuff from when it was snowing so I need
to figure something out and see if I can
link get my car cleaned and do that
today just because I feel like having a
clean car will make me feel so much
better
comment down below those of you guys who
have your license if you guys agree with
me like I just having a clean car makes
everything so much better and is so much
more like relaxing to like drive around
okay I just like to set up my camera on
my little thing in my car hopefully it
doesn't fall but I just got a little
lunch and I wanted to show you guys what
I got because I'm so excited I went to
the juice mill it's in Bridgewater
Massachusetts where I go to school if
you guys aren't familiar with it or if
you are it's right in the center of town
it's super cute it basically it's like
your typical healthy juice bar and so
what I get when I go is I always get the
Green Monster and I think there's like
celery cucumber apple spinach and added
ginger it's literally so good and this
girl that I go to school with um works
there and she made it for me and it's so
so so good she's so cute
so I'm just drinking this it's like much
needed for me right now I like need to
get as many like greens and good things
into my body as I can get because I've
been feeling really really tired lately
and I've just been like feeling like I'm
gonna get sick so I like needed this
right now then I was in the mood for
more than just a ginger shot cuz I was
gonna get a ginger or like an immunity
wellness shot I was like you know what I
really want to get a juice today and I
also got a wrap too and it is avocado
tomato basil mozzarella and balsamic so
I'm so excited I'm gonna eat this and
I'm sitting in my car at my apartment
just because that's like one of my
favorite things to do of all time I love
sitting in my car cuz it's so warm in
here like having the heat on and like
playing music and just sitting and going
on my phone it's like so relaxing to me
I don't know why it's one of my
everything's in the little world I could
sit here like forever and ever and Emin
I always like drive around and then
we'll just like park somewhere and we'll
sit in the car and just show but this is
the rap look how good that looks oak so
good and I'm like obsessed with raps
lately I don't know why like I would way
rather eat a rap than a salad so let's
try this and see how it is mmm
mm-hmm
it's so good oh my god I literally love
tomato basil mozzarella with balsamic
that's so good
the avocado just adds like some good
healthy fats in there and then it's on
like a little spinner trap this is so
bomb so I just finished eating my
sandwich I drank my juice I went to my
phone a little bit and I facetimed a few
my friends so now I'm gonna go inside

obviously Valentine's Day everyone's
always like oh my god I like my
boyfriend girlfriend and it's just like
all like relationship base and whatnot I
just want to say that if you don't have
a boyfriend or girlfriend on Valentine's
Day
don't let that like ruin the day for you
go out and do stuff for yourself because
honestly before you can love someone
else you have to be able to love
yourself first so just go out there do
something nice for yourself and like
have yourself a day do something that's
gonna make you feel good inside and go
like take a workout class or like get a
smoothie Bowl eat something healthy like
go for a run or I don't even know
there's so many things that you can do
to like make yourself just mentally and
physically feel better and so take that
day to like treat yourself and don't
like sit around and be sad and eat
chocolate and do all that I mean like
celebrate and have some chocolate but
also go out there and just like kill it
and be a bad bitch and I hope that you
