Jack you're Marcus it was so sad but I

now I end up to dinner with my mom we're
at Burton's Grill in Derby Street hang
on
I'm so tired and so exhausted I've got
something to show you guys my god you
guys are going to be so excited I just
am like so happy I had the best weekend
with my friends and I just think that's
really important to like surround
yourself with good people and I really
think that like once you get into
college you really kind of find who your
true friends are and
who has your best interest in life and I
just I kind of had a really good time
with mom and Lily they've been my
friends for such a long time
lily and I have been best friends like
since eighth grade which is so creepy
for both turning 21 and like in eighth
grade I was like 13 so it's just crazy
to think that like we've been through so
much together or like we always will be
friends like no matter where
how do they see her like we don't really
get to see each other that much but like
we still can pick up right where we left
off I just think it's important to keep
like those kinds of friends close to you
and that's my little rant for Jay
so we just finished a dinner but of
course I have to get a little dessert so
I just went to Cold Stone Creamery and
guess what I got
banana ice cream with walnuts and
chocolate chips just like drunk monkey
my favorite but like I recreated it by
myself
