get it so I just got up and I'm gonna
have breakfast right now get my day
going I'm just having my favorite
everyday breakfast two scrambled eggs
with spinach and some cinnamon reason is
eat your bread we need to get more water
oh my god a lot of questions about where
this was from and it's from Starbucks
it's one of their little tumblers that
you can get like when you're standing in
line waiting for your drink just looking
at all the stuff that they purposely
place there so you spend money on it
yeah that's one of those I need to do my
makeup but I'm literally whiter than the
shirt that I have on I just wanted to do
a little outfit of the day because I
don't know I was kind of feeling this
but I'm just showing this little urban
thermal shirt you would have seen in one
of my hauls like a while a while back
and then this little bralette thing from
urban as well underneath with these
cobalt blue lines and my tan
adidas gazelles so this is the outfit of
the day I'm not kidding you and I say
that I wear
Lululemon aligns every single day and
have them in every single color because
they're literally all I wear and they're
so comfortable so yeah I hate wearing
jeans I need to get a coffee I don't
know if I should go get one now or if I
should wait until I leave I don't know
what you do so maybe I'll get myself
together leave now then get a coffee and
just go early Oh
decisions decisions okay finally ready
for the day and I got some stuff when I
was in Boston a couple days ago over the
weekend
from Brandi and I know you guys are
always interested when I get stuff from
brandy melville but I only got a few
things so I feel like it wouldn't be
enough to do like in a full haul so I
just thought that I would show it to you
now it's like literally still in the bag
because for the longest time I was like
am I gonna do a haul with all this stuff
like what am I gonna do with him
and I didn't know what to do when I also
have
everything else that I bought down there
which that's not really that many things
at all so here is all the stuff from
brandy and I only got a few things so
this is the first thing that I got it's
just this gray cropped hoodie and
obviously it's one size because brandy
melville everything there is one size
fits all then and the next thing I got
are just these joggers and there are the
brandy melville plain grey joggers a lot
of you guys were asking where I got them
I was wearing them in my vlog from the
other day so they are brandy they're
super soft and super comfortable then I
just got one of these brandy tanks I
wear the grey one all the time but this
one is just plain white and it has some
little buttons up the top I guess just
really plain a nice piece to have and
this one is also a nice piece to have in
your closet too just a plain tank with a
little v cutout from the front and then
lastly I got this light grey comfy cozy
cropped long-sleeve cotton like t-shirt
crew neck whatever you want to call it
so as you can see everything that I got
from brandy was super comfortable and
just like plain and cozy that's like my
vibe you guys know so I'm so excited I
got all that stuff it's kind of hard to
shop there in the winter they don't
really have much and yeah so that's what
I got I'll have all the items linked
down below for you if you want to check
them out I'm just leaving Starbucks and
I literally forgot how good the iced
green tea was this isn't iced green tea
unsweetened it's literally so good
so I got one for me and for a month
I'm gonna go scoop her from school and
we're gonna probably go get lunch
because I'm literally starving so I
wonder where we're gonna go I don't know
what I'm in the mood for but I'm super
hungry I'm like having the best day ever
right now I'm like having literally the
best day ever I don't know if it's
because the sun's out and the Sun hasn't
been out in like weeks but I'm so happy
right now and yeah I don't know I'm like
listening to my like bastard 2017

so happy like putting in the best mood I
don't know I just hope everybody has an
amazing day like whenever you're

I followed this girl on Instagram for
the longest time I used to have a
fitness account for those of you who
have been like real OGS from like years
and years back back when I used to do
with the Caleb EBG workouts so I used to
follow this girl Cal FitLife and I'll
show you her Instagram so she recently
commented on one of my Instagram
pictures and I was like oh my god like
freaking out because I used to follow
her on my fitness accounts so long ago
and she was like I watch her flogs like
saying all this stuff so I was like wait
this is literally crazy I used to follow
her so long ago and like she's one of
the fitness accounts up that I like
started following like way back when I
started in my fitness journey so to see
that like she followed me it was so
crazy so I messaged her and we were like
talking back and forth about like maybe
meeting up and like going the SoulCycle
together I just think it's so cool like
I'm so blessed to have all of these cool
relationships on social media don't you
agree
yeah like our leash yeah but I don't
know just like meeting so many people
online it's like the coolest thing ever
and then you get to meet them in real
life and it's just like I don't know so
great and I'm so happy and thankful for
that but I could not do it without all
of you guys so I just want to personally
say thank you I love you guys it's so
cute look at it of
skirt skirt all right I'm gonna put the
car in park nice good job so we're gonna
go get a Christmas tree now and we have
to go pick it out for our house and I
want a big one think I were in charge
oh my gonna hear mom always loves
getting the small ones
my boys used to be obsessed with getting
the small Christmas trees and we'd be
like no we won't you think I want that

the capabilities farm right now in
Dennis my hometown and I'm picking out a
Christmas tree with Emma for our house
look at both blogging what is my never
but we are at capabilities and our mom
wanted us to get the Christmas children
here because all of the proceeds go to
like get donated to the capabilities
program which if you don't know what
that is I don't really know too much
about it but it's kind of like all the
kids that have disabilities so they
donate all the proceeds to them it's
high so we're gonna go pick out our tree
now and if you're not subscribed to
Emma's Channel hobbies everything linked
down below she's new to YouTube she's
doing vlogmas oh my god I want this tree
why is this the tree that we're legit
gonna get what if it doesn't fit in our
house I think we found it the first tree
it's love at first sight oh my god

like legit the perfect tree is it really
we like the ones that are so this is
soft Emma this isn't the prick this is
soft that's not this is prickly that's
soft no this is prickly touch it this
one's cute cuz it's like big but it's
big enough to fit in that area of our
house looks like the one that we get
every year why cuz we always throw a fit
Emma and I throw a fit every single year
when we go to pick up Christmas trees
because no one wants to get a big tall
Christmas tree they all want short ones
they're like no that one's too tall that
one's too tall and we're always like no
my mom always wants a short fat one I
don't like shortened fat ones oh my god
I'm literally gonna have a big tree like

right here this is a Fraser Fir this
one's cute but why does it look like not
full it's not full at all it looks like
the one that mom got online it's really
funny tree online it's a fake tree she
ordered it and it's like the most
heinous thing ever sorry if you see this
mom
it literally so gross it looks like the
one from Charlie Brown Christmas like it
doesn't have any like branches or
anything it's the ugliest tree I've ever
seen so I'm like mom we cannot have that
as our Christmas tree like the thought
that counts that and the thought that
was there it's really cute and all but

I'm excited hey guys so I just got home
it's literally like 2:00 in the morning
and I'm so tired
but I went obviously like as you saw
like my whole day that I had yesterday
letting just went out with my friends
and well actually like not like I think
gold my actual friends I actually went
out tonight by myself and I was like you
know what like I want to have fun
tonight like I want to go out and like I
don't know just like live my life so I
went out by myself tonight like
completely alone I didn't even get ready
I didn't like put any makeup on like
this is I've been wearing this makeup
all day I wore literally a tank top and
my Lululemon aligns and my adidas Stan
Smith's like that time when I were today
and I wore a leather jacket and I was
like you know what I'm gonna call it a
night I'm just gonna wear this thing I
don't care I just want to go out and
have fun and like be me and stuff so I
went out tonight and like I met some
amazing people and it honestly was like
so heartwarming and just like exactly
what I needed tonight so I don't know
I'm just like really happy right now I'm
like I spent some time with like some
really good friends that I haven't seen
in a while and I'm gonna put a few clips
in because honestly like tonight was so
much fun
and so it was so unexpectedly fun like I
had the best night ever and I met the
sweetest people like I don't know just
moral of the story is I don't know why
I'm really like like ranting on about
this but like what I kind of wanted to
say was like don't be afraid to put
yourself out there because I know for me
like I've put myself out there a ton
with YouTube and just like I don't know
like going to a small school it's honest
it is hard to put yourself out there
like like what I do like I post my life
on Instagram on YouTube as you guys know
and like give me hard at times like with
people knowing everything about your
life it's like you worry like are they
gonna judge me like what kind of
criticism I am I gonna get it can be
hard at times but tonight I honestly met
some amazing people that like reminded
me of why do this and like why I came on
YouTube in the first place and like
things like that just make me so happy
and so thankful for my life and what I
do and if you ever see me anywhere in
person like no matter what the situation
is come up to me and say hi to me and
introduce yourself I want to talk to you
when I have a conversation with you and
like I want to be your friend like I
want to build friendships and I can
honestly say tonight I met these three
girls and now like we're friends so this
one girl came up to me and she her name
is Megan I'm just gonna say it now her
name is Megan she goes to my school she
was like Maggie honestly like I don't
think I ever would have said anything to
you if I like wasn't at a party drunk
like I probably would have never came up
to you but I watched all of your videos
like I love your videos and like we just
went talking about all this stuff and
not like her and I are gonna go to the
gym together it's just like I don't know
I'm just like really happy so I thought
I would end the vlog off here and yeah
so I'm like exhausted it's 2:00 in the
morning like I said I'm gonna take a
shower and then I'm gonna set an alarm
and go to the gym at 7:00 because gotta
get back on your somedays guys
