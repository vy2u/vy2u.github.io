this is so pretty
everyone's up there because they left
without me so now I'm climbing up so
we're going to but
necessarily engaging with the content I
agree yes I told you gonna believe that

a big controversy while we're waiting
for our food at Earth about why the
people on Instagram stories that come up
at the table why are they sitting there
so you guys really answers that leave
your comment down below and let us know
because I have no idea why they're

dying to it and also I'm for mercy
question we're at Earth
I brought the pesto chicken salad
Gretchen got the hummus tabbouleh salad
a little almond milk chai boba tea that
Emma thinks is way too sweet and I agree
come freaky and go outside huh my God's
name is Gretchen honestly I obviously
have to eat at earth since I'm in
California but mixed field greens with
chicken and this was definitely not
$50.00 all of our salads here Louis 50
it's definitely more of like a trendy
place to take pictures for Instagram I
gotta go to the store and gotten all
these ingredients and made a salad
[Laughter]
