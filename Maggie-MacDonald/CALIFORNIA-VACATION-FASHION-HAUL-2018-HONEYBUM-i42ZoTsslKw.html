today's video I have another honey bum
haul for you
I am so obsessed with everything that I
got from honey BOM all these items are
so cute and when I was getting stuff
this time I was like you know what I
always try to wear like different
clothes and get out of my comfort zone
but then I end up buying these clothes
and then I never ever wear them so all
these pieces that I'm about to show you
are definitely staples they're very
neutral and very versatile you can wear
them with anything dress them up so many
different ways so that's my style and I
want to really focus on things like that
for 2018 kind of like really going into
like my style and showing you guys what
I like and the products that I use and
the clothes that I like and things like
that and I will have all of the items
and the honeyBun website linked down
below for you guys and without further
ado let's get started so the first item
that I got from honey bum is just at
this top that I'm wearing right now it
is this maroon silky blouse and I have a
little tie in the front I love it I
think that it's so cute to wear with a
pair of jeans and like nude heels and I
just think that it was so different but
also very like classy and neutral from
my closet because it does have little
stars on it which is gonna dress it up a
little bit but it's nothing like too
crazy it's just silky and plain which I
really like I think that that look is so
in right now the little silky blouses I
think that they're so cute so I'll
definitely be wearing this a ton I'm so
excited to bring it with me to
California and next I got this little
white top and it just has this little
ruffle detailing on the sleeves and on
the bottom it is cropped and you guys
know what that I love cropped shirts I
got this one in a size small honey bun
tends to run very true to size so I
usually get a size small in all of my
items and yeah I just think that this
top would be super cute with like a pair
of high-waisted mom jeans and either you
can literally wear sneakers or heels
with it whatever you want you can wear
booties if you're like in California or
whether where it's more warm during the
winter you can definitely do that and
maybe just pair a cute little jacket
over and I think that this top is so
cute and it can definitely dress up any
outfit and then I kind of got a similar
top in black but it's definitely more
cropped and it has again the ruffle
detailing which is super cute and in the
back it also has this little open a cut
which I really liked
and I think that these types of tops are
so perfect because they are super
comfortable I feel like this material
fits so well and it's just one of those
shirts that you put on you don't feel
uncomfortable but you look super cute if
you know what I mean so I think that
this shirt is definitely gonna be a
staple in my closet just because I love
to ring on little tank tops and wearing
them with jeans and stuff like that that
is definitely my vibe and yeah so I
thought this one in a size small as well
and then I picked up this maroon little
tank top it has these little skinny
straps on it and it is cropped I got
this one in a size small it's the
softest material ever I'm so excited to
wear it and I just love little things
like this like little tank tops and
shirts that you can just throw on and
wear with anything and they're very
plain and neutral because I feel like
for me and my closet if I have items
that are crazy and like out of my
comfort zone I don't wear them enough so
I got this because I know I'm gonna be
wearing it a ton I can literally wear it
with leggings I can wear with jeans I
can wear with a skirt shorts whatever so
I definitely think that having little
staple pieces in your closet goes a long
way especially for me like I've bought
so many different items of clothing and
I just find that I don't wear it as much
because like I wear it once and then you
think back to when you're like oh my god
and form that a ton of times but
something like this is just so neutral
and basic and you can literally wear
with anything the next item is my
favorite thing out of this whole entire
haul I'm so excited to wear in
California it's this little white tank
top and it says honey on the front in
red and it fits me so well I tried it on
and it fits so well it just hugs your
body in the right place and I love how
it has adjustable straps on the back and
I don't I just think that it's so cute
like to wear with a pair of jeans that
are ripped and some sneakers I think
that I'm gonna be loving this look with
like my circle ray bands I don't know I
can like picture it right now when I
post an Instagram picture and if this
video is up before that you guys will
know you'll be like that is it inked up
and it looks so good you guys literally
need to get it I'm so sauce with it
and next I just got a body suit from
honey bun it's this black lace one and
it just has these adjustable straps in
the back honestly it's like kind of
looks more like lingerie I thought that
it wasn't going to be see-through like
this when we saw it online but it's
completely see-through so I don't know
if
just gonna have to wear like a bralette
under it or like how I'm gonna be able
to work this but yeah we'll see with
that I wasn't expecting it to come in
looking like this but I don't know how
I'm gonna wear again I don't know if
it's gonna like work out if I wear a
bralette or like what its gonna look
like maybe it'll look okay if I wear a
bralette and leather jacket over it like
some high-waisted black jeans we will
see and last but not least I got to this
awesome jacket from Honey babak's this
bomber jacket and it is a kind of not
sweet it's like velvety and it has this
really cool red white and blue stripe
down the side I thought that that was so
cool and different just because I have
had bomber jackets in the past like I
have one that is army green and I wear
it all the time but I just feel like
everybody has those like everyone has
your typical black bomber jacket or your
army green bomber jacket but I thought
that this one was so fun I think that
it's so different in the way that it
looks on it looks amazing so with a pair
of jeans and like a plain crop shirt a
white one with like some sneakers in
your hair in a bun
I think this jacket makes an outfit look
so cool and also another good thing that
I like about honey bum is that all the
pieces are super affordable too so
you're getting items like this but
you're not putting a dent in your wallet
which I love so that concludes my little
honey bum haul for today I hope that you
