a concealer and I'm gonna use the Fed D
since you learn in the shade bamboo and
I'm applying with my finger I'm trying
to catch it alike and look up and just
do that because I don't know I feel like

cave okay next I'm gonna bronze up my
face with the hoola benefit number okura
we yes and we all like oh do you wanna

that hungry it's that we knew we were
going to a diner late at night for oh
yeah so we all go and like me and Maggie
no more like okay we'll just eat here

me Maggie I love that Maggie so
protective over her friend she's like
that's my friend like that's my friend
don't mess around
we could be literally oh now I'm gonna
be bronzing my faith even more with this
Kat Von D shade and light palette and
I'm using the dark shade in the middle
right like brown shade with this brush
by vanity planet these are my absolute
favorite brushes I love the bronzer one
and then also usually I put like my
whole face bronzer with this kabuki
brush I think that's what it's called
kabuki brush yeah and I use this but I
use it for highlighter all over my chest
yesterday
yeah so that's I didn't I used my real
techniques brush for my bronzer just
because my face would have been like
glowing gold but I love these vanity
planet oh yeah I love those yeah I
really liked them too I don't know this
one is just like perfect like to do my
contouring and I'm not really doing that
crazy but car drivers kind of like doing
three looks I do crazy contour I was
just about to say no one gives me crap
in my case the head don't throw shade
because I put on a lot of bronzer I just
like looking bro
me too I feel like I need to put more
just because we're like going to
Coachella there's little ants crawling
around my makeup clearly and then
Gretchen also conjures the size of her
nose which I've been doing - look at me
go watch me roll watch me though yeah
that's that and then I'm gonna go in
with a little blush action if I could
find it with my Danny Planet flash crash
this is my favorite blush brush ever cuz
look I can let every tip tip and I use
Tarte in the shade party already party
and actually as like three days for a
party hard I'm like looking up at the
viewfinder because I can't see it always
go dink dink dink dink makeup guru but
like not really that sound is maddening
phone well my boss even is like you look
cute
your face like looks good lately I told
you that looks even Wow I'm sweating
new tune I'm taking out my jacket okay
in the day I just put it on for you guys
but let's be real a swimsuit ah it's
fine I like to show people like the real
sides of me
and now I'm going in with the banana
shade but called lyric underneath my
eyes just to brighten it up a little bit
you're like I've been following your
order if you haven't noticed everyone
I've just been copying over here that
Maggie does
Oh what would I do would you measure
that
I'm gonna do highlight I'm not doing the
same mistake as I did yesterday where I
am started doing my shadow wait wait do
you think it's bad if I just use my
bronzer on my eye okay this is honestly
ridiculous at this point that I still
use this and embarrassing and I'm really
sorry and I'm gonna throw this away
after I use it like right now it's that
I have to go buy a new one
why is that in your video no I didn't I
swear I will look at it I just put it on
for the birds get away from me and now
obsessed with fan brushes and if we use
them before I know by two-faced
love light ray of light highlighter and
I'm going in with my absolute favorite
Laura Geller big baby right here I love
it big jack I thought that Maggie's
names were just named she made it but
they know they're like oh and she's like
safe oh my gosh oh god I need something
to highlight our geez we ate honey can
we literally eat so much stuff last
night we got home Johnny who's Mac no I
want to use yours okay Gretchen and I
ate so much last night
we literally I think I probably had 30
Chips Ahoy
and I had two doughnuts so that was my
life ugly so I'm gonna pink frosted one
but I'm using the little shade foxy like
you're not little I don't know I say
this all the time but it's just that
not ten but like yellow reshape my Irish
has been good come back my ashes are so
weird for mr. de jakke top Jimmy's no
they literally are now I'm gonna use
half-baked next with no everything
you're saying is funny to me he just
kinda did you have settings me no but
you do that Noreen one I was running get
it I'm back
I thought you scurry away he literally
saw I don't want to do the same eye
shadow as yesterday we're gonna switch
it up boys
what am i doing today I'm to see no are
you oh I do the same every time I get
ready I'm using my finger why am I like
this
I've been putting goals I'm putting
half-baked on maybe I'll make it a more
gold look I'm so bad at eye shadow so
I'm just putting it all over my eyelid
half-baked it's like the gold color of
The Naked 2 palette you said that
already that that's what I'm doing I'm
using the brush that comes with it cuz
I'm super into makeup like that but good
you know how people get ready in there
like I'm using the Sigma e 7:17 yeah
it's like the brush that legit like I
don't really care I don't used to be so
into brushes and then I was like wait I
would be if they weren't like fifty
bucks for one brush you know I feel like
they don't matter that much what I do
but like you know they do they
definitely do wait oh oh my god
why did I
that's a game-changer not at beautycon
that's a freaking ginger account is the
best stuff okay
wait if you'd console on it you're going
to next very much yeah TVD I think I'm
going with maybe not we'll see I'll keep
you updated okay

really cool color wait that's it look
really pretty

be different than yesterday but now I'm
conquered by lost dropped it by Felicia
Felicia don't text this is gonna look
really weird but I just took dark and
went over the light are we doing okay I
don't know if I think this do you notice
how harder it is to do your makeup when
you're filming it than if you're just
like inside yeah it's me
like it looks worse but you know what
that looks good Maggie Margaret it's a
different way my dad at eyeshadows well
