started
so I think both let's start off with the
same product this the Fendi foundation I
love the matte I love it I love it so it
is it really is oh my god Emma I want so
she's two and I love my silk rope oh I
dunno tell you I need a listen I'll wash
mine I don't know what I'm doing her
wash your what wait so grow oh you bring
it to like the dry cleaning
yeah I know I need to want it oh well I
make a box
oh yeah well you're won't my sheep I've
said don't do anything I don't know if
like we're doing anything um everyone
asks what shade of foundation I'm in and
I'm in the 260 I'm 270 I'm 260 mine's
just cuz I told the lady I was like more
like a little bit different coloured
anyway yeah and um I self tan year-round
oh we a - the summer and I don't wear
makeup in the summer but this is my self
tan shade year round this is my self tan
shade I think not year round but yeah
because it's I can tell that it's later
I can use this and I could use it in the
summer but Oh probably
I don't work for me to do one I don't
either
I do like one in like a little you got
sir I need you cuz one doesn't really
cover as much like um I make a runway
melt very idea
oh yeah it's a lot me too
I just feel like this stuff actually
feel like me this doesn't match myself
down colder really yeah this doesn't
either so I like bronze myself up so me
- that's morning matches but like you
don't want em Plus this like oxidizes
true cuz like the darker you go the
orange I can't see either
I'm we're at our other selves right now
because our house is getting redone so
we're here for
just like the weekend well I'm only here
for the weekend but I'm gonna staying
here for like a while I've been here
since Wednesday already yeah and so we
don't really have like the resources
that we would if we were home like
working out I haven't worked out since
Tuesday yeah
I'm getting my hair cut today and I
don't know how short to get it cut hey
to put some weight there coz I'd like a
red spot I'm gonna put foundation over
my lucky you me too
my eyebrows are so Pam I literally so
bad
I'm also getting my camera fixed today
if it looks like it's not focusing its
cuz it probably isn't but cuz it broke
arlynn dropped it a few times
arlynn why you drove it but then I'm
gonna go in with the Fenty matchstick
concealer in bamboo I'm just gonna kind
of put this like on the high points of
my face as you can see here just like in
my t-zone and then under my eyes as well
oh my god I'm so hungry so I'm gonna put
it there I'm so blending my foundation
really yeah I love that even Asia but it
just doesn't blend well around my mouth
windows whenever I like um conceal my
under eyes you look at myself to do
anything yeah this whenever I can see my
under eyes I always look up you can make
sure I'm taking my Beauty Blender and
patting looking up I'm taking just a few
family trees
we both are obsessed with the Real
Techniques sponges and our Sephora brush
oh my god the Sephora brushes I'm
selling to makeup
I'm gonna going now with my Sephora
brush and set my under eyes in the
foundation I love this one this brush
like is perfect for the area that you
need it
I love honestly that this funky thing is
like compact you know yeah me too I like
compact I use compact when I first
started wearing makeup but it was like a
foundation about yeah that looks fine I
look so much way too right now I need a
bronzed up really bad me too okay I get
a lot of questions on where these
brushes are from hey these are from
Target these brushes that we used to use
they're just like I just really matter
where she's our friend like I don't
running I really don't use a brush I
don't care what makeup that much cuz I
wanna know everything I don't want to
sound like but I don't really need it
but yeah I don't really care what type
of makeup I use I like Fanti but I don't
really care what like brushes I use for
I couldn't either
they're all gonna do the same thing I'll
do the same thing but I just fresh got
the job done I've had this one for ever
since my friend when they used
I'm using the hoola bronzer this one's
yours my little mini hoola she took for
me they never give back you make the
travel size so I'm gonna literally put
that all over my face because your girl
needs to bronze up mmm
I'm literally almost done I feel like we
don't really wear that much I really
take time and like Rudy with bronze
everywhere just cuz I use this one for
bronzer I use that for contouring like
this is like over face powder but now
I'm gonna go in with the same brushes
Emma and I'm gonna yeah that's what I do
whoa I love this brush so much it's like
the most amazing brush ever look at that
that's amazing
I can't see okay I like the Fendi mirror
I need to blend it
we literally use the same make products
so we'll have all the makeup products
that we both use link down below I don't
think there's one thing that we use it's
different up to highlighter that I
haven't got yet yours oh but mom hasn't
why no I'm just saying mom has like the
same another oh yeah but like I don't
wanna take her no I know but like I
thought that you got it not her for some
reason no but well how do you use right
now
none you can use mine today why would
you put it on my neck um I don't
normally wear mascara you don't need it
I need it every where my skerin so long
I kind of hate where I'm Bob being able
to rub my eyes and in school especially
like say if you're like it starts like
settles when it on my upper lip what
does foundation and it really makes it
like overtime it doesn't okay oh we use
different blushes you know I used the
Tarte Amazonian clay 12-hour blush and
glisten I use the ones that have used
since homecoming freshman year when the
lady at Clinique did my makeup for me
yeah you do love ugly need one I don't
know why it just kind of it goes with my
skin tone more than that one you can't
really see on me yeah to have different
scandal
more Portuguese my favorite part is
coming up like literally if you've heart
ever really I feel like I look so white
oh my god yeah I know it really is just
like watching us out but that's just
because we have to use the natural light
of the day but where do you use their
add this Oh blush I use my gosh that's
what I was thinking I use this one I
used to use this one too is this the one
that you yeah mine's not as like pressed
out but I used to use that one too but
now I use this one cuz like really oh
that's my highlight brush I know I don't
wear but our lighting is my favorite
step of makeup but I wouldn't say that
it's a makeup that if I could only wear
one product ed where highlighter
obviously I wouldn't choose that and
probably choose like bronzer honestly
but oh my god this brush to go with the
highlighter I don't know if you guys can
see it's like this little tapered brush
and this is my highlighter right here
you saw my favorites video you would
have seen this both of these items so I
just go ahead and highlight my
cheekbones and done oh my god and then
my Cupid's bow I mean I hope my Cupid's
bow and then to put my nose mom called
me the other day and she's like I use
the sparkles on the Cupid's bow and the
tip of my nose and my cheekbones I was
like oh really oh yeah you can wow
that's literally amazing I can't get it
right Apple was your words every day
keep it going today for like working out
there's like you're like okay you can
use my brush check cuz yours has yeah
so on it obviously my eyelashes aren't
as long as Emma's so I am gonna put on a
little mascara but I use the dior
Maximizer 3d lash primer and oh my god
it makes my eyelashes just so long
because if you can see my eyelashes are
not long at all so I'm sorry I thought
that was mine so I'm just gonna go in
and put this on my lashes just like a
little coat before adding my mascara and
usually when I put on anything on my
eyelashes I start from the bottom and
kind of wiggle my brush and work its way
up just so I can get every individual
lash my makeup changed since we did
since we went to Ireland Singh Sodhi mad
and now I'm gonna go in with the L'Oreal
telescopic carbon black mascara this is
the ride-or-die literally the best
product ever it's so cheap it's like
eight dollars from any drugstore and it
makes your eyelashes so but I only put a
little because I don't think like the
way that eyelashes look when they get
cakey this is your brush
can I use your flower gun no good though
oh it's moms that I saw nevermind she's
a big one is in her room yeah did I need
to use it to my gosh is we're done
oh my god it's so itchy why I don't know
and that concludes our little chitchat
get ready with me we have so many things
to do today so we really have to start
getting dressed and getting our day
started but you'll see our outfits and
