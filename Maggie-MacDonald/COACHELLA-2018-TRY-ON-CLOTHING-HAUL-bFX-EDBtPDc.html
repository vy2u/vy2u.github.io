today's video I am super excited to
announce that I am going to Coachella as
you can see by the title I'm going to be
showing you guys some of the items that
I have picked out already that I'm
probably gonna end up wearing at
Coachella so I'm so excited to do this
video I'm gonna have so many vlogs and
like up videos and get ready with me
while in my Coachella but I just have
thought that I would make a video and
announce it and just show you guys some
of the stuff that I have picked up so
far and I will be going to Coachella
with the app dote if you guys don't know
what do't is it's literally my favorite
app in the whole entire world I'm so
obsessed with it
you can literally buy anything on it
I've talked about it in Sony in my
videos you guys know I love it so if you
guys want to download the app you can
use my code Maggi and get a $5 gift card
to any store on do't which i think is so
great I recently became obsessed with
princess Polly because I discovered it
on the app and now literally everything
I wear is from princess Polly like the
shirt I'm wearing right now princess
Polly I'm so obsessed with it so without
further ado let's get started with the
video I don't want to like sit here and
ramble on I just want to show you guys
what I got I'm super excited
so yeah that's concerning
okay the first thing I just want to show
you guys which I thought was super cute
they actually sent me this and it came
in this little blue dope box I was like
wait this is so cute I wonder what it is
if I can even get it open
oh my god but basically they sent me a
little card and it just says Maggie and
then the inside says you're going to do
jealous so excited you're coming clean
xoxo you're dope fan so this was super
cute thank you
guys you guys are so adorable I'm so
excited I love everybody who works for
dote you guys are all so sweet and nice
and I can't wait to meet you but they
sent me this really cool like rose gold
crown because if you guys know like the
theme of Coachella everybody wears like
flower crowns and stuff like that so
look at how gorgeous this is
like this is the one that they sent me
I've never seen anything like this it
really makes me feel like a princess
like I love it and I feel like I want to
like try to put this in one of my
outfits while I'm there I just think
that it's super fun and I'm literally
never gonna get rid of this because
going to Coachella has been like a dream
of mine for so long so like the fact
that I have this opportunity is
absolutely amazing like I am still in
shock I can not believe it
so next I just picked out a few
accessories and the first thing are
these earrings right here and these are
from princess Polly and they are just
these gold earrings with these little
coins dangling off them and they make
little like jingle noises I don't know I
feel like what is that girl that wears
them and like dances is not a belly
dancer I don't know maybe it is but I
don't know I just think that they're
super fun and cool and they're gonna be
so perfect at Coachella with this outfit
that I'm about to show you guys I cannot
like believe it I have no words for this
this outfit is unreal I literally want
to wear it every single day of my life
and never take it off and it is from
revolve and the brand is House of Harlow
and this is the top it's just this red
crochet bralette with these little
fringe details on the bottom and it's
completely open in the back and just
ties and then these are the pants
like I have no words at all they're red
and crochet as well but look at the
bottom they flare out and they are like
bell bottom and they are like
see-through from the thigh down and they
just have like a little built-in shorts
I'm so obsessed with these I cannot wait
to wear them when I got it in the mail I
was like oh my god I tried it on and I
literally was like walking around the
apartment doing laps because I didn't
want to take it off it was so cute and
I'm so excited to wear it I just don't
know what shoes I should wear with it so
I need to figure that out and then I
just got this gold layered necklace and
it has like this bar detailing in the
middle and then just these little
layered coin chains and then it goes all
the way down and has this little flat
like bar this is so weird I'm having
deja vu right now like of me showing you
guys this necklace I don't know why
that's so weird but the next thing that
I got are these shorts and they are by
the brand a brand jeans and they are
from princess Polly and they're just
these really high waisted black
distressed denim shorts I didn't own
black distressed denim shorts before but
I was like wait I need to get them and I
have them in like a light wash blue
color and I wore them recently in Miami
I showed you guys and they fit so well
than my absolute favorite so I had to
get them in black and then I just got
this princess Polly shirt and it's a
black short sleeve blouse and then it
just ties in the front like a little
knot these are super trendy right now
and I'm so excited to wear this I'm
gonna definitely probably wear it with
the black high-waisted shorts and they
get a really cool statement belt and
like wear really cool jewelry and I also
just ordered these cool sneakers but I
couldn't wait to show you guys like I
literally wanted to show you guys all
the stuff now and like tell you guys
that was going so I think I'm gonna do
like a part 1 in a part 2 of a haul just
so it's not like super long and then
last but not least I got one more thing
and this doesn't really have anything to
do with Coachella itself it's more of
like what I'm gonna use as my carry-on
on the plane to Coachella but I got this
backpack and it is a Herschel backpack
and then it's just on like palm leaf
print and I got the bigger one I know
that they have a smaller version of this
but I think they're the same price
and this one just has like a little spot
for your laptop which i think is super
cool and also I put my notebook in it
from school because I got it in the mail
today and I was like oh I'm gonna try it
out like this is cute and I don't know I
just like put my notebook in there and
haven't taken it out yet but it's really
roomy and big it has a little
compartment for your laptop and then it
just has this big zipper compartment and
then a smaller one on the front which
will be perfect for like my wallets and
my headphones chapstick all of my little
necessities that I use on the plane and
I think that that'll be super helpful
because the flights gonna be so long so
I'm definitely gonna have to carry more
than I normally would have if I was just
going on a short trip and I also forgot
to mention I also got another dress from
princess Polly and I'll insert a photo
right here but I let my friend borrow it
cuz she has a formal on Friday and so
she was like wait I need a dress and
like I can't find any so I literally
took every single dress that I had in my
closet and I gave him to her in a bag
and I was like here try all these on and
the dress was inside the back that I
gave her but I'll insert a photo right
here it's super cute so if that
concludes my haul video for today if you
guys are interested in getting any of
these items I will have them all linked
down below for you and you can also buy
them on tote I got them all off of do't
from princess Polly revolve and I think
that's it
yeah only princess Polly revolve so I
will have them all linked down below for
you to check them out if you guys want
to get them whatnot thank you so so much

you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
