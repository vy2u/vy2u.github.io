morning it would have been the same
thing I've been doing couple days but
this is my outfit today I'm wearing this
little bikini top from Safa with bandana
my way Valentina boots if you and these
little pants were misguided but
Gretchen is not ready out were supposed
to be back very very soon
and she's still doing her makeup and
fashionably late as always to the
festival and it's really early kind of
sick very cocky and car TV doesn't go
until 6:00 I know that in the news he's
a little bit leaner so you just got here
early because it's like the last day we
want to enjoy everything and go on the
ferris wheel maybe but it's nice to like
be here when there's not other people
speak a like these pictures and get that
out of the way so then we don't return
our phones and stuff just so nice but
I'm glad that I wore this like bikini
top because it's really hot today
my pants are definitely not that kind of
a move because of how hot it is
if they'll be fine she's going to need
to like stay in the shade I'm gonna be
using this a lot more today because I
woke up this morning and had a lot of
dust to right through from Jim and I are
taking pictures right now
let's jam
thank you
fools the food here so good there's so
many good places to eat I really needed
something healthy so this is like the
perfect thing right now Josh and I are
just having a little boat and we're
sitting here and she really likes the
guy that's playing right now so let's go
that like he brought me here
eggs

mom
Gretchen and I are in line for backyard
pools were getting it cause people
I'm super long
and it's so much more dusty on the
ground and it has been like all
weekend so that's why I'm wearing this
pendant I don't really enjoy near me but

bandanna over my face you see what I
just try to do
Gretchen yeah
