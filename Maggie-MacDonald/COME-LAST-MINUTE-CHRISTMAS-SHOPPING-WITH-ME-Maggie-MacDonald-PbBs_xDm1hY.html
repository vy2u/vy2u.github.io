wearing so I found this huge mirror in
urban I can show you guys so I'm wearing
at my blank NYC leather jacket I always
wear I'm obsessed with it this little
top it's like a thermal from urban and
then I'm just wearing these olive green
Lululemon aligns and my sneakers that I
got from greats and I'm wearing this
watch right here and it's from JC and
look how gorgeous it is like I'm
obsessed with it because I wanted a
watch I was gonna like look normal when
I wear outfits like this where I didn't
want to look completely like
underdressed by wearing like my Apple
watch and make it look like more
feminine and less like athletic if you
know what I mean and these watches are
so amazing like a look at it it's made
with real diamonds I'd look at it
sparkling I know it's on focusing but
it's made with real diamonds and they
are made in Miami Florida and a bunch of
girls came together and made the
products because they wanted you to be
able to wear something like a timeless
piece that was gonna last you forever so
that's why I really like this company
and also the straps are interchangeable
which I love I have this nude one on it
right now but if I wanted to I can
interchange it for like a black one or
anything like that and I just think that
they're super good quality and they're
amazing watches and they look so
feminine and so nice on your wrist and
there's such such such good quality so I
will have the link to the JC website
down below you guys can it check them
out if you're looking for like a
last-minute Christmas gift idea I think
that this is the perfect thing to ask
for because I know how many of you guys
don't really know like if you would use
an Apple watch because you don't know if
you like all the settings on it and like
you don't want to track your steps if
you don't need all the extra softwares
but you just want a timeless watch I
think it JC is definitely perfect for
that so again I'll just have all their
information linked down below
look how amazing this watch is guys it
is so perfect I am so happy that I got
it because like I said it's just so
feminine and so timeless and it really
adds to all of your outfits right now I
meant like
with my best friend Molly you guys have
never met Molly before that's so weird
this is Molly literally of my best
friends and like sophomore year of high
school so she picked up at school today
cause like I had a fight all this
morning at 8 o'clock and then she pick
me up and she was like we're literally
gonna stay together we're gonna go
shopping so I just wanted to like bring
you guys around while we do a little bit
of Christmas shopping but first we
stopped at Whole Foods and I'm literally
gonna scream guys don't even know what I
got my favorite panini probably in the
whole entire world that's see it the guy
like custom made it for me because I was
like do you have it tomato mozzarella
panini and he was like oh I can't make
it for you and I was like yeah baby
so just I was like tomato mozzarella
basil and she's literally recorded me
but it's tomato mozzarella basil on like
seven green bread and it's so bomb and I
can always eat it and yeah so and then
I'm gonna go to a woman because some one
of you guys come to my video then you
said that like if you go to Lululemon
and bring a pair of your pants that you
like don't wear anymore they will let
you exchange them for a new pair so I
was like I spent so much money they're
like I really should do that because I
have a pair of crops that I don't wear
and I literally don't wear crops like I
can't wear them so I'm gonna try to
bring them back there and then I'm gonna
try to get like some little last-minute
Christmas gifts and hopefully and this
video will inspire you guys for some
little last-minute gifts that you can
get too so yeah okay so just went to
Lululemon to like it tried to figure out
that little Fiasco that I was talking
about before and come to the conclusion
that you're not allowed to do that which
I kind of knew where I was like wait you
can't just bring back every little
woman's and get a brand-new pair there
does have to be something wrong with
them like a broken zipper or like the
seams or something which I thought so I
mean I guess that's good to know because
I was like wait all these years I've
been buying new lemons I had no idea you
can just get new pair
totally false but I did meet this girl
and she was so cute and she teaches at
Pure Barre and she also our assembly
woman and she like does all their
marketing and she was so cute she went
to my college and she was like wait I
follow you on Instagram I'm like my
boyfriend goes to your school so but
like I graduated but yeah she was so
cute it like made me so happy because
honestly like I don't know I just really
like like meeting people like if you
come up to me and you're like I follow
you an Instagram like we can get talking
about it and stuff like that's my
favorite thing in the world and she was
so supportive she was so nice I loved
her but now we're going anthropology are
you kidding me it's 30% off the whole
store now shut up oh my god I'm about to
go in I'm literally gonna scream oh my
god guys everything that anthropology is
30% off right now so if you're looking
for last-minute gifts like I highly
recommend coming here my favorite
perfume that I always use is this
vanilla one right here and
is normally $18 but right now since it's
so do percent off it's gonna be so cheap
so yeah yours are looking for a little
last-minute gift definitely come here
like look how much stuff that they up
they have the cutest little guest I
honestly got all my gifts for people
from Anthropologie I'm not gonna say
what I got because I know that like they
watch my videos so I don't wanna give it
away but like seriously look at all of
this like this gum is amazing those lip
glosses are so amazing if you guys know
that they're my favorite I've talked
about them in so many videos of rose
bombs they just honestly house like
little cute things that like anybody
would be able to enjoy I think that this
is so cute and the best idea ever I am
thankful for and all these people wrote
all these different things look how cute

the cutest thing ever but this is what I
wrote this holiday season I'm thankful
