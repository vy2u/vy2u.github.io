I'm so pale but our Saturday morning
workout is done we got up at like 7
o'clock when you're out the door workout
at 8 o'clock so we just finished Mike
put us through the best workout ever
I feel so good look at it - my arms look
stronger already and we did abs today we
did like a lot of abs and arms instead
of legs because we were really tired
from legs the other day and SoulCycle so
that's what we did it's gonna be really
nice out today like seven high 70s and
we're gonna go to the beach and
hopefully I can get like a natural tan
on my face I feel like I need like
normal natural color you know how did
you like your workout me too and the
pull-up bar thingy with more apps I won
- I know I'm so impressed by the girls
and now they're getting some hammer pegs
in the back I think that this view is
the coolest ever
can you see that back there it's like
all like hilly in mountains well yeah
like hills the Hollywood Hills it looks
so cool I love it I love it here I know
I was talking to Gretchen about answers
about how I want to like live here oh my
god I love it here because it's much
like a chill vibe and like that's what I
love I I mean I love being in Boston I
love the city but I like going for like
a night and spending the night in a
hotel and like being there and then
leaving and being able to go back home
to my apartment yeah which is not in a
city and that's why I love it here
because like it's just such a chav I've
it's like relaxed and like you can get
in your car and drive down the street
with the windows down it's like warm and
like listen to chill music and like go
to Starbucks and get a coffee or like go
somewhere go to SoulCycle and you can
drive places like that's what I love I
love driving like Kaylee and I love just
getting in the car
going to get coffee and like driving and
talking and like I love that so I know I
want to live here but yeah
if you are in Laguna Beach come to Mt
fitness with Mike he is so good I'll
have his information or link down below
for you but basically he like knows what
you want to do and they put you through
the best workout and basically
it's like quality over quantity and he
gives you like a really really good
workout and a short amount of time like
we're out of here stretching warming up
like doing our forever
so yeah if you guys are ever in the
beach you should totally hit him thank
you Mike thank you and now I literally
have never needed coffee so bad in my
life
dink Gretchen stole the front seat I've
been sitting in the front this whole
entire trip I had claimed it as my own
and I get to the car and she beat me to
it guys look how good these donuts look
at this little secret don't know place
that we're at and Gretchen Emma and I
are sharing this massive cinnamon roll
it looks so good and Gretchen and Emma
are happy because they found kombucha
our favorite healthy kombucha
so this is what I got I forgot to tell
them that he didn't want cheese on it
but it's just like a veggie scramble
with a bunch let's wait that one out
this is what I got I got the veggie
scrambler sensitive mean spirited person
guys I'm telling my vlog what I got I
got the veggie scrambler for breakfast
and I wish I didn't get cheese because I
don't really like cheese that much and
still make me bloated Gretchen got
cheese Emma didn't get cheese and I
didn't want cheese but I still got it
anyway now I'm sad I'm gonna eat it
anyway I don't really see your teeth oh
you don't do you Wow we are back at the
beach this place
cannot get any more gorgeous I'm so
thankful to be here with my friends
obviously in my sister and like be in
the Sun and be experiencing this beauty
I feel like this whole week I feel like
I've just been like really trying to
like take everything in and not take
anything for granted or like anything I
thought like I'm so so so thankful I'd
like to be able to see the beauty of
like the other side of the country is so
amazing and oh I'm just like so happy
right now
but we're gonna just chill for the day
it's really really nice out and we're
gonna probably like take some pictures
and just enjoy ourselves here and yeah
if you guys ever can come until the
windy beach if you guys have the chance
you totally should it's so amazing the
vibes are just so chill it's so nice I
literally don't want to leave I wish I
could stay here forever
so for the rest of the trip I'm just
going to be taking everything in and
yeah
we're getting ready to it leaves the
beach now we just did a big shoot in all
of Arlen's 8 a.m. March it was so cool
the bathing suits are amazing
and yeah so we've got like a little bit
of Sun they don't know how tan I got or
I even got again but it's so nice out
literally it's like the best day since
we've been here it's so nice and we like
tried to get some really cool pictures
but it's also hard because like I just
want to live in the moment and obviously
enjoy all of this but I want to keep
like creating content for you guys so
I've been trying to keep a balance of a
little bit of both so I think you guys
are gonna be really happy with all the
photos and stuff like that so look at
Gretchen back there she's so cute she
really wants to get photos on these
stairs behind us back up there like that
leads to the way out from the beach so
I'm gonna get some photos for her -
she's so cute e I'm gonna get some
photos for her on that I have a hanger
from Martha Ireland left behind but
we're gonna go back to the house now and
we're gonna lay by the pool and like
chill and stuff and I'm so hungry you
can like find something to eat because
I'm starving
but Trevor
it's literally so nice out
today's like the most perfect day ever
it's like sunny and 85 degrees ah in
this bathing suit I know I'm gonna get a
bunch of questions on it it's from
saffle it was really really affordable I
think it was like 12 bucks or something
which is so cheap for a bathing suit and
I mean the quality is OK for me I just
feel like since I have really small
boobs it fits me really well I know that
if you have like bigger boobs that might
not fit you as well because I know
sometimes that can be hard but I like
Saffold eating food so I think that
honestly for the price of them and it
gets the job done
because you don't really want to wear
bathing suits oh my gonna be good Emma's
little hand for me like I don't really
like wearing bathing suits multiple like
summers in a row just because I'm like
uh I wore that all that summer like I
get sick of it so I feel like Zappos
perfect to get bathing suits because
they're so affordable that like you can
wear it for one summer and then like do
whatever you want in it then kind of
like get rid of it is only ten dollars
so yeah you guys we are together right
now we are the cutest
in California and everything on my name
is so good I don't know when but I don't
know if I should get hot heat or not but
this place is so cute it's in the
release so warm out it is like agreement

fit ever
