today's video I'm gonna be sharing with
you all of my current beauty favorites
in all the products I'm gonna be showing
you today range anywhere from my
favorite skincare products my favorite
self-tanner and a few makeup products
that I've been loving lately and so just
to make it super easy for you guys I
will have all these items linked down
below for you and without further ado
let's get started
and first I just want to start off by
showing you my favorite skincare
products and one item that I have been
absolutely loving lately is this face
mask right here it's by the brand
formula ten point zero six I think
that's the name of it yeah formula ten
point zero six and it is just this
poreless pure skin clarifying mud mask
and it smells like strawberry oh my god
it smells so good you can get it at any
drugstore and I just put this on my face
when I feel like I'm breaking out
because I've been traveling so much
lately that my skin has really been not
reacting well to it so I like to just
put this mask on and it really just like
takes everything out of your pores like
anything that's bad and just like clears
it all up and it even says right here on
the bottle that it clears your skin and
it has instant complexion perfection
which I absolutely love and Emma
actually introduced me to this so Thank
You Emma and it's really really cheap as
well it's only like six dollars I know
some masks can be so expensive and this
one is definitely affordable I
absolutely love it and I highly
recommend it to all of you and next is
just my favorite serum and I've been
loving this one lately you guys know
that I tried it and a vlog a few months
ago actually I think it was like last
month and I actually ended up really
really liking it and I'm gonna order the
full-sized bottle now and is it is just
the only hendrickson truth serum and it
smells like citrus it smells so good and
I really like it I feel like it really
brightens my face and clears it up like
my skin has been so radiant and glowing
lately and I think it's definitely
because of this product and if you guys
want to get the travel size at Sephora
just to try it out it's only 15 dollars
so it's something that if you get and
don't end up liking I know Sephora
allows you to bring it back and you
can return it and get something else but
it's only fifty dollars so I recommend
if you want to try it getting the little
travel-size one and the next item is my
favorite toner and it is the rose floral
toner by fresh Beauty and what I do with
this is I just spray it on a cotton pad
and then wipe it all over my face after
I take shower when I wash my face in the
morning and then I will put my serum
serum on right after that and I feel
like those two products together are
amazing they have definitely made my
skin so radiate and so glowy and very
very clear so this product is around
forty dollars from Sephora and I know
it's kind of expensive but the whole
bottle lasts you for so long I got my
first bottle of it back in November and
I just recently replaced it now this
product lasts you so long so I
definitely think that it's worth the
money and a thing that I like about it
is that it has this spray bottle at the
top here so when I take a cotton pad and
spray it on it doesn't waste any product
as if I were taking like a bottle and
pouring it out I feel like the spray is
really conservative and you can also use
it as a makeup setting spray which I
love and my last skincare product is my
absolute favorite lotion I will give a
shout out to my best friend B for
introducing me to this it is the Jergens
hydrating coconut oil into coconut water
what is this called lotion so this one's
my favorite you can get at the drugstore
I love it I feel like it makes my skin
super soft and it also makes it glowy as
well I love the Jergens brand it smells
so good it feels so nourishing on my
skin really really really it keeps my
skin feeling hydrated so if you guys are
looking for a good full body moisturizer
I highly recommend this Jergens one and
before I go into my favorite makeup
products I just wanted to quickly show
you my favorite perfume and it is the
vanilla perfume from Anthropologie I
have a little bit left of it it smells
so so so good and it is only $18 so
honestly if you're looking for a good
perfume and you don't want to like put a
dent in your wallet get this one right
here I swear to god you will love it so
much I'm obsessed with it my sister's
obsessed with it Kaylee's now obsessed
with it my best friend Lily's obsessed
with it so you guys get the gist like
you will be obsessed with that it's only
$18 usually for a big full bottle of
perfume they cost like $100 and I
think that that is ridiculous because I
feel like I get so sick of perfumes and
honestly some perfumes are so strong
smelling that if you spray a little bit
on you like I get headaches from it but
this one is so light so fresh I
absolutely love it and it just comes in
this cute little glass bottle so you
guys need to go to anthropology and get
this one and comment down below when you
get it and how much you love it because
I know that you guys are gonna be
absolutely obsessed with it okay and I
have some makeup products here in front
of me right now that I just want to show
you guys and these ones are my favorite
products at the moment these are what
I'm wearing on my face right now and I
haven't been really wearing makeup
lately just because I went to Miami for
spring break a few weeks ago so I got a
nice natural tan and I don't need
anything and honestly I don't like
wearing makeup I don't like wearing
foundation I don't like wearing
concealer I don't like wearing any of
that honestly just show your natural
beauty because I feel like it's just
like better for your skin and I don't
know you guys are all beautiful so you
honestly don't even need makeup and
these products have been my favorite
lately and my first one is this bronzer
right here it's just the benefit hoola
bronzer my favorite I already hit pan on
it and I'm gonna have to get a new one
soon but basically I just take this with
my favorite Real Techniques fluffy brush
put it all over my face and then kind of
like contour a little bit on my
cheekbones and like my jaw line my
forehead and on the sides of my nose
that's it and then I go in with my
favorite blush of all time and it is the
Tarte glisten blush and this is just
what it looks like I'll show you guys
and it just looks like this and it's a
really really beautiful rosy color with
some sparkles in it and I love it it
just really gives you a natural glow and
then on top of that my absolute favorite
highlighter ever is the laura geller
highlighter and this is in the shade at
glided glow and it's just there's a big
gold bronzy highlighter I like to take
this with a little brush and then just
put it on like my cheekbones the tip of
my nose my Cupid's bow anywhere that I
want to like glow up and make like pop
on my face and then to finish off the
makeup look depending on if I'm going
out to dinner or if I'm just having like
a casual night
if I'm going out to dinner and I want to
spice up my look a little bit I will use
this NYX intense butter gloss in the
shade cherry custard and this one's my
favorite I wore it in a recent Instagram
photo when I was in Miami I'll insert
the photo right here and I just think
that it's the most beautiful color and
honestly the NYX lip products are my
favorite because one they're so
affordable and two they just are so
pigmented and really go on well and when
they call it an intense butter gloss
they are not lying it goes on so well it
stays on and doesn't look like bad or
cakey or streaky or like chunky I used
to use a lot of high-end lip products I
use Mac I have used Smashbox I have used
so many and I just feel like they really
get clumpy on my lips I don't like the
feeling at all this one is absolutely
amazing if you're looking to wear like a
bold lip color I highly recommend
looking into the NYX intense butter
glosses and then for my favorite nude
lip you guys know it's my favorite
already it's just in the next fortune
cookie and it's just the most perfect
nude in the whole world I don't know if
you can really see that but it's amazing
my absolute favorite I wear it during
the winter during the summer all times a
year literally it's five dollars it will
change your life and to finish off this
video you guys have been asking me so
much in the comments and yes I will do a
whole routine for this which probably
just keep up with what I was going to
show you guys but that is my favorite
self tanner and right now I don't have
any on that's why I've been waiting to
do this video just because I want to be
able to show you guys how I applied my
self tanner go through all the steps and
right now I don't need any so I didn't
really want to waste my product when I
don't need it yet but I know I'm gonna
need it in a few weeks when I'm not in
the Sun anymore before summer starts so
my favorite product of all time I ride
or die is the loving tan mousse in the
shade dark and I have the two hour
Express right here and also just the
regular deluxe bronzing mousse these are
my absolute favorite products I will not
be able to survive without loving tan
and I discovered loving tan last year I
think in March and I used to use Jergens
before and if you're scared of using
self-tanner do not be scared when you're
using loving tan because I swear it is
the best product out there it is not
streaky it makes you that
bronzy glowy look that you see all of
her Instagram all those girls on the
beach in Bali with those gorgeous tans
that's what you look like when you put
this on I'm not kidding so I discovered
Lovington I used to use Jergens and I
would get it from the drugstore and it
was a mousse and I would get am it from
Sephora just the essential pay one I
think and it was really cheap it was
like ten dollars and I used to apply it
and it was so streaky it smelt so bad
looking back on it now I'm like how did
I use that Kayleigh nice to Vic oh my
god we love Jergens but now I would
never ever use it ever again Lovington
is so amazing I know that you can get it
on goat it's like twenty seven dollars
or something and if you guys go on the
Lovington website and want to order this
you guys can use my code Maggie and it
will get you a free tanning mint just to
apply your self-tanner wet so what you
do is you just take your self-tanner
pump it on the mint and then just rub it
into your body and something really
important that I like to do before I
apply it is I like to use an exfoliating
mitt and this is just a loving tan one
as well they have these on their website
so you can buy them and then they also
have this product on their website that
you can buy as well and it is the loving
tan bronze shimmer luminous cream and I
like to use this when I'm going out at
night I'll put it like on my arms and my
legs and like my chest if I'm wearing
like a low-cut shirt or something and it
just really makes you glowy and like it
literally makes your body shimmer and
look so good in pictures so those are
all of my favorite beauty products at
the moment I hope that you guys enjoyed
this video and give it a thumbs up if
you would like to see a full
self-tanning routine because I know you
guys have been asking for that lately
and I would love to do that for you just
to see like how I apply it and like what
I do before what I do after all those
steps because I know self-tanner
might be scary for you guys if you don't
use self-tanner don't know how it works
it really isn't at all I know that if
you're scared to use it now you try
Lovington you're gonna be obsessed with
it just wait until I do my routine and
you try it and then you would come back
and be like wait I'm obsessed with
loving tan I don't know what I was doing
with my life before had it so let me
know in the comments also if you liked
this video just to sit down and be able
to show you guys my favorites I don't
know I like watching these types of
videos cuz it shows me other products
that other people aren't liking things
that I can try so let me know if you
like this I can kind of make it a
monthly
thing on my channel if you want so that
concludes this video thank you guys so
much for watching and I will see you in
my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
