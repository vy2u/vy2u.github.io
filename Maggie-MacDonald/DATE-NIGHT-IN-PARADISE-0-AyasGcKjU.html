tonight tail up for the day where did I
get these I left shorts with a brand new
tank and what are you wearing over there
yeah get it we're on our daily morning
walk to get our coffee from our favorite
place
ever I think it's called friends market
so if you guys are ever in Miami he
should go there because the coffee is
really really good and we haven't really
tried going anywhere else for coffee
just because we had it that one day and
it was so good that were addicted now
make this shape it makes me shake that's
so like strong but it feels so nigga I
feel like you're gonna botch it
I do like should I go to medium yeah
right there but like it looks like a lot
it is a large yeah I just a small cup is
definitely smaller yeah why don't the
medium stuff looks like there is no
medium there's neither small or large
it's so weird I also need to get a water
I'm like yeah it's your area like dry I
need water
oh it feels so good out it's already 70
degrees every single day I'm like oh my
god
well off to do our searching okay at
least got a large iced coffee black
yeah
the eShop that we don't know it's okay
to house like a little market side has
regular outside we got it and look at
Kaylie's cover I don't like it she just
usually she has a flat top like mine
with a big long tall straw but she said
there was too much like it was filled up
too much so like I couldn't get the flat
hopper I would all spill out the top it
looks like a little Frappuccino yeah but
it's not it's a coffee and I'm gonna
spare you guys the questions just
because you've been asking where bikinis
have been from every day so mine's from
saffle and Kaylie's is from pretty
little thing it's always a little glass
and so are her little glasses if you saw
her Instagram which if you aren't
following her on Instagram I'll put a
little photo for Instagram right here on
the screen it's just at Kaylee Varney
and so now we're gonna go to the pool
again where you're supposed to go to the
beach but it's 10:45 and we kind of call
it like a late start to the day
Oh which reminds me now that I was just
in the mirror I kind of wanted to
address something which I normally
wouldn't have done this in my vlogs
because I don't really take into
consideration like when people comment
like hate on my videos I don't care it
doesn't affect me it doesn't make me
feel bad about myself but so many people
who are like saying stuff about me in
the mirror and like oh my god this
girl's so self-absorbed she's so
obsessed with herself and I don't know I
just think that you guys are like
wasting your energy and time and it's
not I'm not gonna say like oh my god I'm
not self-absorbed I'm not of this and
that like you guys don't know me
personally I know how I am I know that
I'm not I'm not gonna sit here and try
to like convince you to feel a different
way about me but just a lesson in life
just don't have that type of negative
energy in your life I just feel like you
people out there that are commenting
stuff like that like there's no point in
that and maybe try to like I don't know
what I'm trying to say
like don't we I just think like don't
waste yeah don't waste your time being
negative
you have one life like just live your
life and like be happy and negative
energy attracts me exactly yeah
that's really what I was trying to say
but I couldn't say it so basically
that's what's good in life just don't be
negative be nice to people and be happy
and like live your life to the fullest
and then you'll start getting like
positive energy and vibes in their life
and it'll just feel so much better
and that's just my lesson so now we're
really coming out to sing and we had a
good plan for tonight what were we gonna
do our other friends are gonna come
visit ya here too and we're gonna go
drink yeah I think tonight we're just
controlling tomorrow they're gonna kill
