so much this summer so you guys
definitely don't want to miss it but I'm
just leaving Molly's now and I have to
go it's 8:30
and I have a lot of stuff to do today so
I just thought that obviously if I have
a busy day I'm gonna bring you guys
along with me I know you guys really
like these vlogs I need to get something
to eat right now
but I just don't know where I'm gonna go
yet or where I'm in the mood for food
breakfast of the day I got a big iced
coffee from the daily brew and could
comment if you guys watch Ireland's
vlogs he always comes here I turn this
down and then I also got a breakfast
burrito which I'm gonna take a picture
of for Maggie eats I'm like addicted to
this thing just because it shows me
would I eat during the day like helps me
stay on track so if you guys want to
stay on track with me you should follow
and I just got a wheat wrap with spinach
egg tomato and some avocado we're just
gonna be really yummy and filling and
give me a lot of energy and then also my
coffee which I have to have every single
day before my workout this is really
good I really just need a little bit of
hot sauce and pepper but I'm doing that
other than that it's amazing
this is like Maggie's and mukbang but
right now I have to drive like an hour
and a half off Cape because I'm getting
my eyelashes and finally I don't know if
you can see and they're literally gone
this sounds like beating in my eye but
I'm like doing a bunch of stuff before
cuz I was like my eyelash appointment I
thought was at ten o'clock so I was
gonna zip right off Cape go to my
apartment come back but not what's up
one o'clock so I was like what am I
gonna do to pass the time between now
and one o'clock so you guys will see
what I do I came up with a really good
idea it's so warm out I've been up for
so long that it like doesn't even feel
like it would be warm out yet but it's
like 10 o'clock now and it's 77 degrees
and I'm at Seoul and I'm taking I'm
gonna check whose class I'm taking just
because I always forgot Lisa her name's
Lisa and I'm out the Chestnut Hill
studio um I'm just like right outside of
Austin which I'm really excited about
I've never been to the studio before so
I'll let you guys know how lisa is and
how I like and everything and after this
yeah after this SoulCycle class I have
gone to every single studio in Boston
which is really cool
girl you ain't a yeah yeah yeah let's go
something's gone I'm latching on even
know your name but you're still in my
head
so I just sat down with Seoul and I'm
wearing my new pants actually these new
orange ones that I just got from you all
have one link down below as well as the
sports are these like my favorite two
items from there and these pants are
amazing for SoulCycle because you guys
know I like the mines but you like and
where the missiles like a like the
material of them just like is very good
for how like high-end types of classes
so I'm just waiting to shower and our
just deserve so much chance to do our
three other side looks like forth on the
shower and then I'm gonna like
definitely sometimes but I just met this
mom and she was so sweet and I just got
soaked right here but I just met this
girl's mom I don't know like her
daughter was 14 she was 16 year old and
she was like oh what are you studying in
school and I was like oh I'm studying
marketing she was like my daughter
literally is like the same as you like I
tell her to go into marketing is like
that and I was like I'm I told it so
awesomely she doesn't should because I
don't know I feel like she was telling
me like her father's and wasn't me and
like needs to be like he's on the effing
said of like sitting there like grading
papers and like studying in school and
stuff like just like so not me for me
either I need to be like obviously like
doing this so
so I just finally got home it's been
like the longest day ever I feel like
I've just been like running around and
like super busy but I got my eyelashes
done I don't know if you guys can see in
this lighting it's kind of bad but I got
them done then I got them done a twink
lash bar in Boston and I go to Katherine
so I'll have all of their information
linked down below for you guys and also
I have a discount code Maggie ten and
you can use it to get 10% off your
eyelashes which i think is a really
great deal and also I just got home and
opened up some packages that I had on my
counter and I got two pairs of Nike Pro
spandex on Poshmark I just got these
ones that are like a snakeskin print and
then I got these orange ones right here
with this red detailing on the top just
because I like to wear these when I go
running and I don't have any anymore I
like got rid of all of mine so I was
like you know what I really like wearing
them again and I'm like over wearing
Lululemon shorts because they never fit
me right
so I bought two pairs of spandex and I
also got two notes in the mail from
people who are subscribed to my videos
because I bought these like randomly on
Poshmark and the two people I bought
them from ended up being subscribers
which is really awesome so shout out to
Sydney and this one is from did she put
her name Jackie Jackie in Sydney thank
you for the spandex oh so time to unpack
again and I just wanted to show you guys
some things that I recently got just
before I start unpacking so I'm gonna
try out this Bondi sans
self-tanner I don't know if you can see
it's like not loading okay here it is
might I say loading I meant I'm focusing
but I got this in the mail and I'm
really excited to try that out and this
I'm really excited about it's like a
gradual everyday lotion but it like
makes you tan gradually so like maybe
I'll try that out when I go to Italy
just because I know I'm not gonna be
able to like lay out on the beach so
that'll be good to like heat my tan and
a nice glow while I'm away and then I
also got an applicator mitt which is
really cool and then they sent me a
little
what else do I have to show you guys oh
I also got these on Poshmark to these
spandex and they're like these Gold's
shimmery ones I think those are really
cool and then I also got this dress
right here from revolve this just came
in the mail actually I want to try these
on for you guys and show them what show
you what they look like in the mirror so
I'm going to do that I'll show those
right now so this is the first dress
it's by the brand by the way and it
would look a lot better with heels so
I'm going to say it I'm a tippy toes
it's just black like bodycon it may
dress with a slit up the side because I
really have a morning to wear like a
body con MIDI dressed like this but I
feel like if they don't have the slit
and it makes my body look super weird
but it looks like this in the back of
house like a little tie and also
something I noticed that's really weird
on the side there's a zipper and then
like a little hook but one of them's a
hook and the other one's a hook there's
no like place to put inside the hook I
don't know if that makes sense but and
this is the second one that I got right
here I'm going to try this one on right
now and this dress right here is the
brand stateside it's a again like a midi
maxi dress with a slit and this one is
just plain grey and i really want to
wear it with a pair of sneakers and like
a baseball hat so I'm really happy with
this one it's so soft and I love the
color and I love the way that it fits
and then I also got to these converse
right here and they're the I don't even
want to try to pronounce it but this
designer like partnered with converse
and I got these black ones right here
and they're super cool and just like
different because I'm always wearing
adidas sneakers and I just thought that
these are so cool because like they're
different than the regular converse and
they also have a little like evil eye on
them those are really cool and these are
my favorite shoes of all time I've been
wanting these forever and they've been
sold out for like months and so I
finally got my hands on a pair and
they're just by the brand C by Chloe and
this is what they look like they're
gorgeous
I have these saved on my dope profile if
you guys want to follow me on do't I'll
