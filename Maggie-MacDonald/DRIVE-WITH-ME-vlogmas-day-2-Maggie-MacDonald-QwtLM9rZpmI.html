oh my god so I know it's probably
illegal to vlog and drive but I just
wanted to do a little drive with me vlog
I'm gonna be driving around today like
doing some errands and right now I'm on
my way to go get a mani-pedi I'm
celebrating at my birthday weekend in
Boston with my two best friends from
high school Marcus and Lily and all hi
guys I know you guys sometimes watch my
vlog so I love you guys make it wait for
video weekend anyway I'm gonna get a
mani-pedi right now and it's 1106
on the Friday morning it is finally
December I'm so excited it's 52 degrees
out today I'm wearing my DS slides I'm
like pumped you guys if you've been
watching my videos for a long time or
like been following me on social media
you guys know that I love my d2 slides
so I'm just so excited to be wearing
them again like this weather is amazing
that puts me in such a good mood I was
talking about yesterday with my roommate
but like I have seasonal depression I
get so like sad when it's cold out in
like dark and gray and it just puts me
in the worst mood and I get so
unmotivated and I just like feel like I
can't like do anything I don't want to
go to class I don't want to like
literally do anything I just wanna lay
in my bed all day and sleep and I was
talking about it with Emma too like I
don't know I just hate the feeling of
like being pale and I hate when it's
like cold out and plus like I don't have
any nail polish on right now and you
guys know that I get a manicure every
two weeks so it's been about like a week
and a half almost two weeks but I got my
manicure done at a different place than
I usually do on my birthday and she did
like such an awful job the girl like the
lady she was an older lady and I feel
bad saying this but like it really was
not good and like the gel was all over
my hands and I don't know it was just
like not if I'm manic Eric started
peeling after like a week so I'm just so
excited to finally go and get those
and I'm kind of sad because it's so warm
out and I love iced coffee like iced
coffees my favorite single whole world
and I just recently got a Keurig I don't
know when this video is gonna go out
before after my big haul where I show
you which one I got but I was so excited
to get it my own caring because I spend
so much money on coffee that I was like
you know what like I'm just gonna go out
and buy a Keurig I know I'm gonna get so
much use out of it I think it's like so
easy and practical for me to have so I
bought one and I made myself coffee this
morning with my little Starbucks k-cups
and it's freaking 52 degrees out and I
want an iced coffee so I think I'm gonna
drink my hot coffee like when I'm
sitting getting my toe set and then I'll
probably just go get an iced coffee
right after so I can like drink that
while I Drive around that's like my
favorite thing to do in the whole world
and also I took a shower this morning
before like I got anything started with
my day I was literally just gonna get up
go get my nails done get my eyebrows
done and then come home and shower and
put makeup on and like start filming
videos but I literally haven't been
wearing makeup at all and my face is so
pale lately does this happen to you
leave a comment down below like during
the winter when your face is pale and
you just look at yourself and it's just
like uh-uh
like I don't know I just hate being pale
and I also hate wearing makeup in the
winter but I wanted to film a video
today so I wanted to like put a little
bit of makeup on but I was like you know
what I'm gonna put some makeup on before
I go out and do everything like make
myself feel a little bit better and just
like have myself a day like it's Friday
I'm gonna have a good day
one of my best friends is coming up
tonight to a visit and we're gonna be
going out I'm going to the bar for the
first time at school big steps and
finally 21 I'm going to the bar with my
friends I never had a fake ID like
before I turned 21 so this is like the
first time I'm like going to wool not
like actually I guess I might it's my
first time like going to a bar because I
went to a club on my actual birthday on
my 21st and then I went
to get a glass of wine with one of my
old managers when I was on the in Tucket
and we went to a bar but it wasn't like
a college bar so this will be like my
first time at an actual college bar
being 21 so I'm excited and which
reminded me since I'm gonna be like
going to bar and stuff I mean obviously
needed like clothes to wear because you
can't just wear like regular clothes
that you would wear every single day if
you guys are 21 and or if you go to bars
like you know what I mean like there's
just like a different vibe at the bar so
I bought a ton of stuff from forever21
for like going out and like to wear to
the bar and it was so affordable so I'm
gonna be doing a huge affordable forever
21
like going out clothing home and I will
have this that video link down below if
it's already out before this video is up
I don't really know like what the order
is gonna be but I don't know I'm just
like so excited so happy and I'm like
filled with punch videos and I'm in such
a good mood and I'm just like been
thinking lately my arm is getting so
tired sorry
my arms really gonna fall off I need to
get like a little stand for my camera so
I can start doing car vlogs because I
watch a Lisa Dallas's car vlogs and
they're so funny she's so funny and I
love watching her and I feel like
literally all I do all day is drive
around and like run errands and like get
stuff done so I feel like if I got a
mount for my car and I started vlogging
that would be like kind of fun things to
do on my channel let me know in the
comments below if you would like to see
like car blogs like a weekly one I can
do like one a week or something I don't
know just to like switch things up a
little bit but I know I say this in a
bunch of my videos
I don't know I'm just like so happy
right now with my life and I'm so
thankful and appreciative of each and
every one of you who watch my videos and
support me because I'm finally doing
something that I've wanted to do for so
long and if you actually may be able get
into this right now for a little bit
because I'm going to be driving for a
little while maybe I'll get into this
little story
hey guys so I just finished getting my
nails and toes done this is the color I
got on my nails it is the gel DND in the
color or shade on midnight bloom and the
color on my toes is literally amazing
sorry I'm like trying to pull out of the
nail salon right now but the color that
I got on my toes I'll show you when I'm
not driving oh my god it's so amazing I
wanted to get it on my nails so bad but
they didn't have the color and gel to
match the one that I got on my toes cuz
I didn't get you all my toes but I need
to find something similar in jail
because it's the best color ever but I
got my nails done in a guy that didn't
was so sweet I got them done in angel
nails in East Bridgewater in
Massachusetts if you guys are in the
area you should totally go there it's so
good they do such a good job and he
really takes a like his time doing my
nails and like doesn't rush through them
and make sure that they just look really
good and like there's none like on your
skin and I don't know they just do such
a great job and I really like them there
and he also gave me a 10% discount
because I'm a student so that was also
really good I don't know save a little
money getting your nails and toes done
that's always nice so right now I'm just
driving back to my apartment I'm gonna
film a few what hall videos I think I'm
just gonna try to do like one or two
just because I'm going away for the
weekend and I want to have like stuff
pre-recorded so I don't have to worry
about it while I'm away and I'm also
gonna be vlogging a ton and like getting
a lot of content out there cuz its blog
miss I'm so excited
but it got a little cloudy out today
which is kind of disappointing it's
still 50 degrees but it got cloudy I'm
sad and I'm waiting for my revolt order
to come in from Cyber Monday and it said
it was supposed to be delivered Thursday
November 30th and it's Friday December
1st today and it hasn't came in yet
so I'm kind of confused like if someone
stole it or if it just didn't get
delivered so I don't know what the deal
is with that it said it was supposed to
get delivered yesterday I'm gonna like
check up and see like where it is and
also I'm getting a huge package in the
mail from the self tanner company that I
use and I don't want to say again you
guys probably already know which one I
use I've mentioned it before but I'm
doing a big collab with them I cannot
wait you guys I'm obsessed with this
self tanner and is amazing I will never
ever ever use anything else and I don't
know I just love being tan year-round
and I feel like this tan is really nice
and even and I've tried so many
different ones and this one's honestly
of my absolute favorite I used to get
spray tans I used Jergens for a little
while but I found this one oh my god I
love it so much so I can't wait to do a
self tanning routine for you in that
package I got a different story with
that package such a fiasco so it was
supposed to get delivered to me
November 7th which was like almost a
month ago and it didn't get delivered
obviously since I don't have it it got
lost because when I got it ordered it
through the company they only put my
street address they didn't put I think
they put only my street name they didn't
put the number of like my apartment so
it just like said the street in the town
that I live in
and I track the tracking number and it
just keeps getting getting rerouted so I
have to go to the post office like the
main post office not even the one in my
town the one that does like the postal
services from the whole area that I'm in
and I have to give them the tracking
number and they had to track my package
and they have to like keep an eye out
for it now and give me a call when it
gets back to trying to get it delivered
again I don't even know so they're gonna
try to deliver it obviously it won't be
able to get delivered and they're gonna
just see that at the post office for me
and I'm just gonna go pick it up when
it's there so hopefully it goes there
soon because I really want my self
tanner and I really want to share it
with you guys because it's so amazing
and I know you're all are gonna love it
but I what else is singing the same yeah
so I don't know I just have so many
ideas in my head right now like my mind
is racing going a million different
directions and just thinking about so
many different things and I'm gonna be
at filming for you guys and I'm so
excited I have so much content that I
want to put out there and I honestly
just need to get through finals and have
it be Christmas break because I'm so
sick of school and I just want to make
videos
and yeah so I have so many ideas I'm
just like really excited I'm really
happy like in a really good mood today
and my mom called me this morning on
FaceTime when I was getting my toes done
and she like had some really exciting
news so I was just like so happy for her
and like I've been such a good mood I
can't wait to be home for Christmas and
be with my mom my sister and my family
uh I'm just like I don't know I'm in a
good mood right now I've been loving
this song lately it's on my winter
Spotify playlist it's fun guy Walker by
Miguel's secret favorite song right now
oh you guys should totally follow me on
Spotify if you want to like to know all
the songs I listen to I will have my
Spotify the link to below
usually I make a playlist every like
sees a guy right now I'm in the process
of making a winter 2017 one well 2017 /
2018 since it's gonna be in the new year
but I'm gonna be making my new playlist
I'm like in the process of doing that
right now and I like to make one like
every season for whatever season we're
in just from like the music I'm loving
at the moment because I like to go back
and listen to it be like oh my god I
forgot I used to like this song you like
listed all these songs at that time so
you guys should follow my winter 2017/18
playlist or my Spotify and if you have
me like song recommendation something
songs that you think I would like leave
them below because I'm always open to
listening to new songs I love music and
I'm always driving so I'm always like
listening to music and stuff and Spotify
is my so leave all of your
recommendations below but there's always
so much traffic in the town that I live
in and the time that I go to school and
versus on the Cape there's like no
traffic on the Cape right now and even
during the summer it's not as bad but
like there is traffic all year here I
swear so it's like whenever I'm driving
it's always like baby lines of cars
waiting at stoplights and stuff and it's
so annoying I think it takes so much
longer to drive it it should that's okay
I'm like really craving a panini right
now but I don't think I'm gonna go get
one because I really just want to go
home and start making some videos turn
turn turn turn
one thing that I don't like about the
town that I go to schooling is there are
so many fast-food restaurants I think
it's disgusting and like if you eat fast
food that's fine and that's your own
personal preference but like there's
McDonald's talk about KFC Burger King
all within not even kidding a
quarter-mile radius of each other are
not even like 400 feet it's gross and we
don't have Whole Foods we don't Trader
Joe's the person is so staring at me
hugging you felt like what the hell was
that girl doing but yeah we don't have a
Whole Foods and we don't ever show your
Joe's and I'm like really upset because
those are my two favorite stores the
closest Whole Foods is like 25 minutes
away and it's such a hostile like I
would go there every day for lunch and
get something from the salad bar I loved
it but I just wish that they like had
one in my town so Trader Joe's Whole
Foods if you guys ever see this video
open one in bridgewater please or near
me somewhere like I'm in need I hope my
roommates won't mind really miss her a
lot right now
skirt skirt okay I'm just getting home
the parking at my apartment is so weird
my spot is like crooked I swear it's
like on like a slanted hill it's like
the weirdest little dynamic oh now that
I'm home I can show you guys um what my
toes look like
here are my little feet down there you
know my self-tanner on my feet looks so
bad I hate feet so I'm so sorry but can
you focus look at it it's like a gray
metallic I love it so these are my nails
and toes I'm really happy with the way
that they came out I think I can take
these off now oh oh
I just dropped it oh one thing that I
wanted to say before ending the vlog is
it's so important to drink your coffee
out of a straw if you're drinking hot
coffee iced coffee whatever it may be
tea drink it out of a straw because you
will stain your teeth so that's my
lesson for you guys today
my Maggi tip of the day I'm gonna go
inside right now and start recording but
I hope you guys enjoyed this little
drive with me vlog I feel like it was
different I don't really do these I
haven't like done one before but if you
like this idea like I totally will start
doing it on my channel I can make it
like a weekly thing like I said so give
this video a thumbs up if you want the
weekly car vlogs to be a new thing on my
channel but give this video a thumbs up
I hope you guys have a wonderful day or
night depending on whenever you watch
this and I love you so so so much I'm
just so happy and I appreciate you guys
so much all of your love and support it
really means a lot to me I read all of
your comments and like things like that
and they don't go unnoticed but I love
you guys so much thank you so much for
