funny morning today but it's our last
holiday I know we just want to go to
this coffee place obviously you guys
know that we've been going every morning
little Foods Market on the corner but
it's kind of loud these two guys were
kind of creeping on us so we're going to
our little cafe that we like to get our
coffee and these two guys that like just
asked for our number like we're being
really weird that we've seen like a few
days in a row just we're in there
sitting and we were like we can't go in
there because like they're really creepy
so we couldn't go get coffee there so
we're gonna have to go find some rocks
again coffee but we're going to the
beach right now like we said we were
gonna get up early it's nine o'clock
we're gonna go get a coffee somewhere
else right now and head to the beach and
spend all day why would cuz Kaylee's mom
said that you got the tannest on you're
at the beach in the best color so we're
gonna go there now and I'm wearing this
bikini from Zaap oh that's pink I don't
ever wear colors he's wearing yellow
again so much honey I'm sure it was like
you have been wearing yellow lately but
it was so cute but we're gonna find
coffee now yeah
a year and they're like really
it's over one year I love the bar area
we just got to the beach I really love
it here we're at the more northern part
of South Beach it's called Collins AB
and I know that what sister you call
that your mom said we wouldn't like
Ocean Drive Ocean Drive it's more like
Spring Break
this is like relax vacation kind of like
luck I don't know but look at the water
it's so pretty
it's crystal clear
it's a gorgeous day it's going to be in
the 70s it has a little breeze it's so
nice out
there's my girl looking like a snack
feels so good just to walk on the sand
makes me feel like I'm back at home
during the summer I see those four - so
the girl said she's so cute cailee and i
are laying on this big bed today on
Miami Beach and we're good it's so
gorgeous here again everything you're so
beautiful
it's just such a chill vibe I love it I
never want to go through the acai bowls
are so good
there was a rubella in it I don't know
why yeah I think they used as a garnish
but something that really is really cool
about this place that we're at is that
all of the food is from Malibu farm I
don't even see the sign up there I put
out my staff that's right but they have
like a Malibu firm restaurant by the
pool and I think that's the coolest
thing ever
everything's organic and yummy and good
and this AuSable was so good and
refreshing for right now we were just
talking about how old back home in
Boston it's snowing and look we look to
our left and see the turquoise blue
ocean and like palm trees mm-hmm and
we're just laying out in the Sun getting
tan and so we really thought that we
need to not take it for granted
we just need to take it all in right now
because I have pretty Ennis I just got a
froze a and it's so so so good it's my
first time ever trying froze a and I
thought it was kind of funny because it
matches my bikini right now it's so
yummy this is like the best way to spend
the last day just laying here in the Sun
drinking Jose with my best friend so
happy right now

hair down for the picture are you gonna
wait let me look look okay look at it to

subscribers they came all the way from
their hotel to come meet me here and
can't ever talk to each other a little
bit
they were so cute and sweet oh I'm like
happy now we are having the best day
ever
I feel like you just get a different tan
when you're on the beach then you do
when you're by a pool I don't know what
it is or if it's a saltwater or the Sun
reflecting off of the water whatever it
may be I just have I'm getting so much
more tan than I have any of the other
days here and I'm really sad
today I think I'm gonna see if we can
extend it later just seeing how the
day's going right now it's like
literally so amazing here I'm having so
much fun looking but we've just been
swimming all day are they going on their
phones or anything I'm just like taking
it all and laying by the beach and stuff
waiting for food but it's so gorgeous

everything here is so white and gorgeous
I really want to come here with Tyler so
I might plan a secret surprise

pizza with pesto tomato and some
mozzarella on it and it's so good guys
to die for so if you ever can go to
Malibu farm it's so good you guys should

too flimsy so I'm eating a fork and a
knife okay these over there charging her

needs to get one of the Apple cases that
I have if you guys have a problem with
