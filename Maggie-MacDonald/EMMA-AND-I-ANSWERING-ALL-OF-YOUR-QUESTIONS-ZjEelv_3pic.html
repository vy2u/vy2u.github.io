have memory together my favorite memory
of us is Mike's graduation day that I

grandma has blonde hair okay how do you
guys take such good pics iPhone swag
honestly if you take all of our photos
online so you never take them on cameras
and our pictures from our iPhone 5 we're
probably the best they were and we just
edit them on visco um what is one thing
that you guys have in common and one
thing that is completely opposite one
thing we have in common is our sense of
style
everyone says if we copy each other we
have this no we have the same sense of
taste like the way that we eat is the
exact same that's true and one thing
that's opposite is probably personality
yeah like I'm crazy and I'm like fun
bubbly and outgoing and funny not that
you're not outgoing and stuff but Emma's
more like quiet and like mature and
chill and I'm like woo I was like like
okay and I'm just like but like that's
probably what we have opposite okay um
