today's video I just thought I would sit
down and do a little chit chat get ready
with me kind of go through these steps
of my everyday makeup routine I just got
a question about how I do my makeup so I
thought of it and I was like you know
what I've never done like a sit-down
step by step talk through what I do what
I apply and I just thought that today
would be the perfect day to do that
especially with Christmas coming up just
so if you guys want any ideas of like
what to ask for you could definitely ask
for any of these makeup products and I
don't use a ton I really like my makeup
to look natural and subtle I don't like
to put a lot of my face so I am going to
just go through my whole makeup routine
and get ready with you guys so without
further ado let's get started so the
first step to my makeup routine is I use
the fenty Beauty primer and this is just
the soft matte pro filter primer so I
give that a little shake and then put
like a pea-sized amount on my finger
then I'm just gonna rub it in my hands
and apply that all over my face and I
love this primer because it is so soft
and it kind of feels like a lotion on
your face but also one of my friends
said it feels like liquid silk it feels
so nice on your face I just think that
it gives you the most beautiful finish
when you put your foundation on as well
so the next step I go in with the Fenty
Beauty foundation I think that it's
really important at least for me I've
noticed that if I use a foundation that
is the same brand as my primer I feel
like made my face have a nicer finish to
it and I'm gonna be applying this
foundation with the Fenty Beauty
foundation brush and it just looks like
this honestly I just got this brush the
other day and I am obsessed with it I
will never apply Fenty foundation with a
Beauty Blender ever again because the
Beauty blenders really like soak up the
product I feel like and this brush just
makes the product apply
so much more even on her face and also I
feel like before when I used to use the
Beauty Blender and used to kind of take
off the makeup around my mouth and like
it would leave my face with like weird
spots during the day so if you use the
fête de foundation and you've noticed
that comment down below and comment if
you use a Beauty Blender or if you apply
it with a brush because I honestly feel
like applying it with a brush makes a
huge difference so I'm just gonna be
putting this all over my face
obviously self-explanatory like this
and the next thing I do is I take the
offensive beauty matchstick in the shade
bamboo and this one is like a concealer
it's just a light color like that and
I'll apply that under my eyes and then
on the bridge of my nose a little bit on
my forehead my Cupid's bow and then just
a teeny tiny bit on my chin like that
then I'm gonna be going in with my same
fenty brush and just blending all of
that out and I put it on these parts of
my face just to like brighten them up
and kind of highlight them and bring
them out a little bit more and
especially under my eyes because during
the winter I just feel like I have such
dark spots under my eyes which just
really will brighten it up and make you
look way more awake which I like
once I'm done doing that I'm gonna go in
with the matchstick in the shade mocha
and this one is a contour bronzing stick
so I'm just gonna be applying it to the
sides of my nose like that and then I'm
also gonna be putting it on the tip just
underneath down there
I don't know what this does but I saw
Kim Kardashian doing it in the tutorial
with Jacqueline Hill where she like
showed how to apply her matchsticks and
I was like you know what I'm gonna start
doing that too because Kim has such a
perfect nose so I was like you know what
I'm gonna try it and I like it so and
then I just put it on my cheekbones my
forehead and then also along my jawline
and you're probably not supposed to use
the same brush to blend in your dark
contour but I do it anyway I don't
really care that much so I'm gonna start
by doing underneath my nose and then
doing the sides and honestly using a
brush with the 50 matchsticks I just
feel like it blends so much better than
when I used my sponge so I really don't
think I'm ever gonna go back to using my
Real Techniques sponge unless I change
and use the different foundation or
different products
and then after I finished blending out
my contour I'm just gonna go in with the
fancy Beauty Universal invisi matte
translucent powder and I'm gonna be just
applying that underneath my eyes and
looking up while I do it just because
you don't want the powder to get stuck
in your creases then I'm just gonna put
it everywhere where I kind of applied
like like contour just because I want it
to stay all day and another thing is I
definitely agree that you should use the
fenty translucent powder to set your
makeup if you're using the fenty
foundation in the primer just because I
feel like since they are the same brand
they really like go together in the
formulas mix well I used to use the
Laura Mercier on top on my Fendi and it
didn't work well it really made me feel
like sticky and it just like didn't
leave my face with like the finish that
I wanted it to and since all four
products are matte like the matte turns
with some powder than that foundation in
the matte primer I think that they all
really go beautifully together when you
all use the same product and I know I
just added like a dark contour with the
match stick but I like to add a little
bit of powder too so I'm just going in
with the hoola bronzer up by Benefit
this one is my absolute favorite it just
comes in the little box many of you guys
obviously probably know the hoola
bronzer but if you haven't tried it yet
I seriously think that you need to I
used to be team chocolate bronzer but
now I have switched over to hoola just
because I feel like it gives me a nice
glow in the winter and doesn't make me
look like dusty because I don't know
what I feel like sometimes bronzer is
like make people look dusty so I just
think that this one's so beautiful I
really love the way that it applies and
I feel like it really stays all day and
then I'm just gonna blend that into my
neck as well because you don't want your
face being a different call
then your neck and now I'm gonna be
applying blush and I got this little
sample size from the tarte birthday
present
ab sapore and it's in the shape party
and honestly I think that this color is
beautiful you really don't need a lot of
the product a little bit definitely goes
a long way so I'm just going to be
applying this to the apples of my cheeks
and it kind of just gives you a nice
little rosy glow like nothing too
serious it's kind of just like a subtle
little glow to make you look more awake
and now for my favorite part of my whole
routine and that is Pilate and I use the
Too Faced highlighter in the shade ray
of light and so I'm just going to be
taking this little tapered brush
swishing it around my highlighter
applying it to my cheekbones both sides
obviously and the tip of my nose
also my Cupid's bow
I think I'm just going over each one
maybe adding a little bit along my face
wherever I feel like I need an extra
little glow and I think that it's so
important to end off your makeup routine
with a setting spray I just use this one
by fresh it is their rose spray so I'm
just gonna take this in and spray it all
over my face I probably use an excessive
amount way more than I need to but I
love the way that it feels on my face I
just feel like it's so refreshing and
light and almost cooling and it really
calms down your skin and makes your
makeup last so long I highly recommend
getting the fresh spray over the Mario
Badescu I know don't kill me I don't
like the Mario Badescu one I just feel
like it makes your face like feel really
sticky and like it feels heavy on my
face so I don't know I don't really like
it so that concludes my everyday makeup
routine I hope that you guys enjoyed
