February I keep forgetting the date at
February 2nd and we just woke up it's
around 9 o'clock we're gonna go get
breakfast I'm just having a little
coffee in the lobby of the hotel next to
the fire because we woke up this morning
and it was negative 7 degrees so hold
here so I'm so glad that like I brought
my big jacket like we're all bundled up
but the good part about being where we
are right now is that our hotel is
attached to the Mall of America so like
everything we're doing is at the mall
and like all the events and like things
you need to do and obviously like stuff
we can do during the day there's so much
restaurants so much shopping so it's
good there it's like all attached you
don't really have to go outside too much
but it is freezing out so it feels so
nice to just like sit next to this fire
right now
and I'm always watching my video I don't
know if you can hear in the back she's
watching the vlog out put it yesterday
but my outfit today is super casual
super me I'm just wearing my clank NYC
II love a jacket with this little
forever 21 crop top that you just got
eight dollars guys Lulu aligns and spied
Edith Stan Smith so and I'm like wearing
minimal make-up today I really wasn't
really feeling it so I just bought like
a little bit of bronzer on highlighter
and I just want to be really natural
comfy because I know I'm gonna have to
be wearing full makeup today they don't
want to put full makeup on today so yeah
I'm gonna stop talking now get on with
the vlog get on that day
and this is what I got for breakfast I
got a little turtle salad and then two
eggs over-easy on top we go good my mom
got something similar and look at those
little cinnamon rolls that you got those
are so cute
Jaden the vlog I found this really cool
bathroom and I really like this mirror I
don't know why and I like how the floors
are white it's just like my aesthetic
but I was showing you guys my outfit I
think a little bit earlier like NYC
thingy and then I'm wearing this tank
top from forever 21
it's saved on my dope profile if you
guys want to go look it's so amazing it
was like eight bucks and it's like a
seamless black little cropped tank top
with my lines you guys know this is like
my go-to outfit and it looks so cute
it's so comfortable and then I'm just
wearing my adidas regular pants those
sneakers and we've been like walking
around and shopping all day at the mall
this mall is cute which is literally
three floors it's crazy I haven't bought
anything yet
I haven't really gotten the chance to
like really look I've just kind of been
like taking everything in we've been
like going to see like a bunch of
different things it's been so much fun
so the days not over yet you saw so much
to do but right now you need to get
water somewhere later than thirsty yeah
oh and I got a hydrate that's so
important because it's so cold here and
so dry that like that my skin's just
- but thanks to my camera I knew that I
did something - like the colors and
stuff with his expensive gonna be so mad
if you think this is perfect Maggie I
told you to adjust it every single time
depending on like what the lighting is
like where you are so now I learned in
Spencer I'm learning so this is so much
better than it was before
yeah like I was saying I just led to an
open welfare country so today's
myself with her
they're looking at the directory for
Computers everywhere to like show you
where everything is then it gives you
eight directions on
get there and stop so what I've seen
before I want to but my mom wants to go
to kilos so I need lotion - but priority
if I need a water weight this is so cool
this is so cool I won't like the floor
my bathroom should be like that and have
my initials caught my attention
like what see it like I want one of
these so bad
I want to look at what they haven't
liked the venue
Nike and I'm obsessing over this jacket
right now and I'm really really need it
for the game I love it and this is the
look that I'm going for I want to wear
something like this girl I want to wear
like those camo pants but I want mine to
be joggers and then I want to wear like
a cool pair of combat but I love this
jacket right now when I found these
really really cool boots this is what
they look like
they're so cool I'll show you like
close-up but they are like this black
like fake obviously fake leather boots
with these pearls and they're just like
seven they're so cool but look at the
price tag 119 like I cannot justify
myself buying those I know they're
really cool and I could wear cool
outfits with that but I just feel like
I'm not gonna spend that much money on
the right now like I don't love them
without much in the body of them like
really dingy but I'm like annoyed
because everyone else is like finding
stuff to buy and like I'm not finding
anything so I don't really know what to
do
and I'm upset but I guess it's just like
not meant to be and I really don't even
need anything so of course like I can't
find my mom in the Mall of America this
place is so huge
I don't know where she is and I tried
yelling but she's not Kristen I don't
know where she is this is crazy she's
texting me she said she was just at the
entrance oh you weren't
no because I'm here she's near Kiehl's
mom but I've never actually been in like
a Knick store so I'm gonna get another
just because I'm running low you guys
always ask me which one's my favorite I
use it looks really weird in this floor
but I use for some communities I'm gonna
get one and then I am about watch Fred
look laughs I eat it it's called cherry
pie I'll show you
so these are my two absolute favorite
NYX lip glosses cherry pie and then I
love but fortune cookie and I don't know
why it like looks like this in this
light but it's a really really good nude
pink
my caramel
they definitely need another one this is
the best possible thing you could ever
get from Starbucks these there
it's and crunchy coconut chips they're
so good and then I got an almond look up
to you know and a little flatter course
off because I miss kandi so much if her
and I always got these but this is what
I'm having
I literally haven't eaten all day since
breakfast like when I showed you guys
and I'm still on graves and dinner is
until 6:30 and I've been shopping all
day I got so much stuff and I cannot
wait to show you guys I didn't have no
words for the Mall of America literally
none
oh yeah that's cool
yeah I can't wait to show you guys might
know face
right now I'm hoping that again I
thought make sure that because I thought
we were so rushed like to get out so I
didn't really have much time to like
take pictures
so
okay something different now when I got
more efficient I usually get like
swimmin or two tops things outside it
just like I'm so excited this literally
looks a bomb
and then precise okay now this is my
outfit my moms like dilly dallying is
about for meeting friends but this is my
outfit and now that I finally have a
phone we are it's a jumpsuit and it has
like this little open the front then
I'll know if you can see this has like a
tie and these open slits on the leg
which are amazing and I'm wearing my
favorite target here a snow I love them
but this proper or jumpsuit thingy was
so cheap I'm probably 21 that's like my
new vibrating I love trevor's when you
want to shop because we really enjoy
this because it is so affordable
my shoes are like 20 dollars in this
thing it's like 40 so altogether the
hardest decision great life I don't know
where to get it
I don't know if I should get movie for
really waiting for me to order so
this looks so good
I didn't know what to get so I just
thought it looks like a table on the
Cape probably way better than the ones
that I always be from Domino's but I'm
oh thank god she got the friend with us
because I wanted
I am done wait have you got two skinny
margaritas my mama's at the bar talking
right now like talking me up she's like
