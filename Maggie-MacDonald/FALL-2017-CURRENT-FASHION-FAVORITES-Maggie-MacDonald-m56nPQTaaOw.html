my thumbnail I don't know how it's gonna
work right now but okay let's get it so
this is gonna be try to be my thumbnail
picture and I don't know how it's gonna
work but you know help you but like take
that picture with all the stuff that
they got in there like huge channel so
that's me
hey guys welcome back to my channel in
today's video I just wanted to share
with you some of my current favorite
fashion items I wouldn't necessarily
call this a fall favorites video because
here in Massachusetts it isn't quite
fall yet it still is very warm actually
warmer than it was all summer so these
are just some of my current favorites at
the moment if you would like to see a
file favorites video once fall get
started just give this video a thumbs up
and without further ado let's get
started so today I'm gonna start off
with my two favorite bottom items which
is a pair of boyfriend jeans and also a
denims these two items are my go-to
right now I just recently got this denim
skirt from Urban Outfitters I did get it
in a size small and ended up returning
it for a size extra small so it does run
very small I highly recommend that you
go down into size if you are looking to
buy a denim skirt but it is just this
light wash denim skirt and it has some
frayed detailing at the bottom and also
this little v cutout in the front which
I love and I think is super cute I love
the way that it fits it's perfect it's
the perfect length overall the most
perfect die
can I just say perfect one more time
anyway overall I just think that this is
the best denim skirt that I have found
yet usually skirts fit me weird and I
haven't been able to find one that is
works for me
and my body type so this one I highly
recommend the next pair of bottoms are
just these ripped boyfriend jeans they
are in a light wash these are from
forever 21 I think they were only around
$30 or so they were not expensive and I
just love the rips on these I think that
they are the perfect boyfriend jeans
they really give you that look that you
see all over social media if you guys
know what I'm talking about it's just
like the pair of jeans with the most
perfect grips and these are honestly
them so I love these jeans so much on me
they fit me on my legs in my butt area
really well but and then on my waists
are super big so I know that I'm gonna
wear a belt a lot with these so just
keep that in mind when you are trying
them on next I just wanted to talk about
a few tops that I'm loving right now
I recently just got this white tank top
from Urban Outfitters I got it in a size
small it is just the kimchi blue brand
and it has kind of like a little peplum
and it is cropped
I think this shirt is super cute with
boyfriend jeans and some dainty gold
jewelry it's just really casual and cute
and can dress up any outfit I really
like this a lot and I think that I'm
going to be wearing it a ton in the next
two tops if you followed me on Instagram
you will know that I am obsessed right
now it's literally the only thing that I
wear and it is this plain black cropped
tube top which is from forever 21 this
was super inexpensive I don't know if
they still have it available on their
website but I'm gonna try my best to
find it and link everything down below
so I did get it in this black color
right here and it's a seamless stretchy
material which I really like I also
picked it up in this nude blush pink
color I haven't been able to wear this
one yet but I'm so excited I just think
that these two tops are definitely
staples that everybody should have in
their closet you can throw them on with
a denim skirt boyfriend jeans yoga pants
whatever it may be these tops are
perfect and I highly recommend them my
next favorite I wanted to talk about if
you saw my last video with the outfits I
wore for my first week of class it I
think I've worn these shoes every single
day to class and they are my adidas
gazelle sneaker these shoes guys are
honestly my holy grail they are my
writer dies I love them so much I have
them in this cream color right here
they're a little bit dirty but I have
them in the cream and I also have them
in this red color I love these shoes so
much I wear them literally every single
day it took me a few weeks to kind of
break them in but once you break them in
they are so comfortable I just wear them
with the no-show socks that
you can wear with like slip-on sneakers
and things like that so yeah these shoes
are amazing and I highly recommend them
the next pair of shoes I want to talk
about are also from adidas and they are
just these grey adidas nmds I wear these
to the gym literally every single day
I'm obsessed with them I think I am team
adidas not to Nike anymore I have to
admit Adidas shoes are just so
comfortable
I just love the way that they look
they're very casual and they're really
neutral and chic and trendy I love
adidas so much right now these nmds are
kind of a fly knit material like the
Nikes they're literally fit like a sock
like I don't even have to wear socks
with these they just fit right to your
foot and they're so snug and I love the
color the color they literally go with
everything so these are definitely my
favorite sneakers right now and last but
not least I have another pair of shoes
that I'm living right now and they are
just these boots that I bought from H&amp;amp;M
they're kind of different I didn't
really know how I liked them at first
usually I couldn't see myself wearing
something like this but they're so cute
I love wearing them with a denim skirt
and a black bodysuit some gold jewelry
and like a little black bag they are
just these very high structured boots
they are very inexpensive as well so I
highly recommend these and I'm loving
these for fall right now and last but
certainly not least I have my Gucci box
right here and I guess this is kind of
like a little unboxing this just came in
the mail today and I got this item a few
weeks ago and it ended up being too big
on me so I have to exchange it and
return it for a new one so it finally
came in I haven't really been able to
wear it that much and came in this
little dust bag here and that is my
black and gold Gucci belt I love this
belt so much you guys I got the thin one
to start off with just the
it's my first one I think it's only
might be a half an inch or an inch I'm
not really sure I got this belt in a
size 80 usually in jeans I'm about a
size 26 I don't know if that will help
you if you are looking to get a good
fella as well but I did get it in a size
80 I ended up returning the size 85 just
because it was a little bit too big on
me but I am loving this belt right now I
just think that it's perfect it can
dress up any outfit it is super trendy
and I love this so much I've been
wanting it for so long so I'm so happy
that I finally have it I'm definitely
gonna be wearing this literally all fall
it is going to be a staple in my closet
I'm wearing it every single day I don't
even care what people say like I'm gonna
get my money's worth I love it so much
I save for it for so long so if you were
looking to save for an item just like a
Gucci belt I highly recommend it they're
super cute and you will not regret it so
