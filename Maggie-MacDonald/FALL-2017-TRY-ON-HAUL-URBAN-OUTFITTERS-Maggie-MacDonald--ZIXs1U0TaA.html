today's video is not like a collective
haul or anything it's just a couple of
things that I recently picked up from
Urban Outfitters and made while if you
saw my vlog from yesterday you would
have seen that I spent the whole day
shopping and I got a bunch of great
pieces for fall and I cannot wait to
share them with you this haul is going
to be a try on haul I know I got so many
requests for it in the comments on my
vlog yesterday so yes I will be showing
you what all these items look like on
they are all amazing I highly recommend
all of them and I will have all of these
items linked down below for you without
further ado let's get started
the first sweater I got from Urban
Outfitters if you saw my snapchat and
Instagram story two days ago I posted a
picture of myself in the dressing room
and I got so many questions on where I
got that sweater and it's just this
cream one from Urban Outfitters with
these really big sleeves which I love I
got this in a size extra small and I
just love the way that it fits I love
the way that it feels it is cropped in
the front as you can see so definitely
wear high-waisted pants with it that's
just what I like to do I just love the
material of the sweater I love the
collar of it I think that it is the
perfect fall sweater
it was around 50 degrees today in
Massachusetts and I just wore this when
I went to class and I was completely
warm it kept me warm all day and yeah so
I highly recommend this the next item I
got from Urban Outfitters is another
chunky fall sweater this one kind of has
a higher neck it's not really a
turtleneck but it's not a mock neck I've
never really owned a turtleneck thing
before so I don't know from architect
it's like the right word for it but it's
again just a big cozy comfy sweater this
one is so soft it's kind of like plushy
and squishy if you know what I mean and
it just has these big long sleeves and
it's kind of a taupe color which I
really like I came to the conclusion
that I look awful in black I look awful
in any dark colors Navy things like that
so I'm really trying to branch out and
get a lot of light-colored items I'm not
really sure if I said the size this
sweater I did get in a size small so I'm
so excited to wear this sweater it's
gonna be perfect for fall especially to
wear with like a pair of boyfriend jeans
bears
sneakers pair of booties this is so so
so cute I highly recommend it next item
that I got from Urban is just one of
these bralette type things I showed it
in my last Urban Outfitters haul I got a
white and gray one but this one is more
of like an orange Capri there's a word
for it I think it's terracotta is that
like a terra cotta pot I don't know if
that makes any sense but it's just this
coppery orange color and as you can see
it kind of has like little sparkles in
the material and it's just these really
dainty thin straps I got this in a size
small and I got this to go underneath
one of the other sweaters that I got
that I'm gonna show you in a second but
yes so I really really like these I
think that they're perfect personally
for me I don't wear regular bras I don't
really need to so I love wearing these
underneath big sweaters and stuff just
because they can be more slouchy and off
the shoulder and it's also super cute so
it's not just like a dingy like gross
bra that or anything like that I think
this is so cute it really just adds
something to your outfit
the next sweater I got from Urban
Outfitters is just this out from under
sweater it looks like this it's kind of
an oatmeal color and it's super soft
it's not really waffle knit if you know
what I mean but it just kind of has like
this um textured material it's super
soft and I got it in a size small
it just has these buttons down the front
and it's super casual and lightweight
but it will also keep your super warm
because it is kind of not really thin
but not thick material I don't really
know how to describe it but and I'm
gonna be wearing this in the fall with
that bra laughs that I just showed you
under it because it is off the shoulder
so I can kind of like keep it salty all
the shoulder and comfy and just have
that comfy casual cute look I would
definitely wear this with leggings jeans
you can literally wear it with anything
it is so neutral and just a great piece
to have in your closet
the last item I got from Urban
Outfitters is just this t-shirt it is a
white graphic tee and it says thriving
on the front I got this in a size small
and if you guys follow me on snapchat
Instagram where you see all my pictures
when I'm posting every single day like
if I take a snap of
like my outfit or whatever I am always
wearing graphic tees always always
always
they are my favorite things right now I
just think that they're so fun and you
can literally throw them on with jeans
and sneakers or leggings baseball hat
jacket and go to class and wear them
every single day so I got this one I
just thought that it was so cute like
thriving because I don't mean to sound
like I don't want to sound like weird or
anything but I feel like right now like
I'm at a really good place in my life so
like basically I was like yeah well you
know what's thriving like that kind of
goes with like my life right now so I
just thought that I would get this oh I
used to have a t-shirt like this from
made while it's a Chow in the front it's
it was red and I just thought it was so
cute and I miss it so much so I got this
I'm so excited to wear it it's so cute I
love tying in a little bit in the front
just kind of adds like a little an extra
just like a plain graphic tee like this
next I got two items from made well and
the first one that I got is just this
little mini pinkie ring and it comes in
this cute little dust bag right here
that says the end fian I don't know what
it says it's in French but I don't want
to even try to pronounce it but I just
got this little pinky ring and looks
like this I think this is so cute it's
so dainty and little I cannot wait to
wear it just I don't know I just think
it adds a little bit to your outfit
because I love goals right now and it
just adds like a little extra touch in
the last item that I got from Madewell
is just this oatmeal colored beanie it's
super soft and I've been really into
wearing beanies lately I have never been
able to find half that look good on me
in my head it's just like a weird shape
my head's very round so they either make
me look like a pinhead or they just I
don't know they make my head look too
round and I don't like the way that it
looks plus my hair used to be really
really long like before I cut it and I
just hated the way that my hair looks
when it came out of a hat but I recently
got this beanie I'm so obsessed with it
I cannot wait to wear it I know by the
material that it's gonna keep me super
warm during the fall and winter so yeah
I'm so excited that I got this and that
