to see a beauty favorites videos in the
future I was thinking about doing a
beauty favorites video every single
month and just having like my October
December February January
I don't even didn't say those months in
order at all but you know what I mean
hey guys welcome back to my channel
today's video I'm going to be sharing
with you my current fall favorites all
of these items are items that I am
completely obsessed with right now so I
just wanted to take the time to share
them with you all just in case if you
want to try them out I know for a fact
that you guys would be obsessed with
them I'm loving them right now so I just
wanted to share them with you so yeah I
have a ton of products I have a ton of
makeup products beauty products things
like that and I cannot wait to share
them with you guys so let's get started
the first products that I wanted to talk
about were just these new makeup brushes
that I got and they are part of the
Sephora collection and it came with 5
brushes as you can see right here and
they are all just completely gold I'm
obsessed with gold right now you guys
know it is one of my favorites so these
are what they look like up close they
are so soft and honestly these brushes
pick up product amazingly and they just
puts it right on your face in the right
amounts where ever it's supposed to go
I'm completely obsessed with these
brushes they were very affordable they
were only $22 for the whole set and
these honestly are the only brushes that
I really need when I do my makeup so I
am obsessed with them I'm so loud that
came with these exact brushes these are
exactly what I was looking for and you
honestly could not beat it for the price
that they were the first brush that it
came with is just this contouring brush
as you can see it is just this hard
brush like this and it has a flat top
this brush is perfect for contouring
like I said I love it so much the next
brush is kind of this tapered brush and
I use this for my translucent powder
mostly in my t-zone and my under eyes
this brush is perfect for them then it
came with my favorite brush of all time
this highlighting brush and it is really
really small and tapered and honestly I
don't know if you guys can see my
highlight right now but it puts your
highlight in the most amazing spot and
it's so easy to apply
I just kind of dip the brush swirl
around in the highlighter and then put
it on
like my cheekbones my nose my Cupid's
bow and honestly the shape of this brush
makes it go on so well it's so amazing
and the gold detailing honestly was a
game-changer for me these are so cute
they're the cutest brushes ever then it
also came with two eyeshadow brushes
that I love and it is just a flat brush
in a tapered brush and these two brushes
are used for all-over eyeshadow and then
like your crease and stuff so these are
perfect
I honestly highly recommend them because
these are the only two brushes that I
use when I am doing my makeup and makes
it so much easier when I'm going out and
trying to do kind of a look with
eyeshadows I don't really wear eyeshadow
that much but when I do these brushes
are amazing and they help it go on so
well the next product that I wanted to
talk about honestly ever since I got it
I've had to replace it twice I am so
obsessed with it it is my favorite of
all time I will recommend it to anybody
and it is the Burt's Bees vanilla bean
chapstick and it just comes in their
typical yellow case like this and it has
a blue top and mine I took off the
packaging just because it's all ready to
peel off a little bit but this chapstick
is so amazing it's so creamy
I love it and it smells so good it
tastes like a vanilla cupcake honestly
it's so hydrating I love Burt's Bees I
think they are an amazing company and
they hands-down have the best chapstick
and the next product that I wanted to
talk about you guys have been seeing a
lot recently on my snapchat stories I've
been wearing a really light pale pink
lipgloss and it is this one right here
from NYX it is called fortune cookie and
obviously you can get NYX products at
any drugstore Target Walmart whatever it
may be this product is so amazing it is
my favorite lip gloss right now it's so
affordable and so creamy it's one of
their butter glosses but oh my gosh this
color guys honestly it's the perfect
pale pink
it looks very neutral and nude and
doesn't look cakey at all I know with a
lot of pale pink so you can put it on in
the kind of looks
honestly Leigh
cake cupcake frosting on your lips which
I don't like that I don't like the look
of it at all but this one is amazing and
I highly recommend it the next item I
wanted to talk about is my favorite
bronzer recently I had switched over
I had always been team to face Chocolate
bronzer I love the smell of it I thought
it was so amazing and then one day I
used my sister's bronzer and I was like
oh my gosh this makes me look glowing I
honestly felt like I had just left
California and I was on the beach on a
vacation because that is how amazing
this product is it just gives you the
nicest glow it gives you the nicest
bronzed look it's so natural it doesn't
look you know what sometimes you can put
on contours and use bronzer and you
honestly look like dusty I don't know if
you guys know what I'm talking about but
I think that this product is so amazing
it does not make you look like that it
gives you the perfect bronzed look and
that is the benefit hoola bronzer and it
just comes in the cutest little box has
a little mirror I love the sponsor so
much obviously you can get it at Ulta
Sephora and things like that I don't
think it's that expensive I love this
product so much and I honestly would
recommend this to anybody this is one of
my ride-or-die beauty products I would
not be able to live without this I use
bronzer every single day no matter if I
don't wear a makeup at all if I don't
want to wear a foundation or anything
like that I will just take a big fluffy
brush swept it around in my bronzer put
it all over my face put on some blush
and go to class and not wear anything
else but this my ride-or-die favorite
product holy grail right here you guys
seriously need to go out and get it
because it is that amazing the next
product I don't know if it's gonna be
able to top the bronzer oh my gosh again
I was obsessed with another product I
loved the Becca highlighters this is
gonna give it away to you guys but I was
obsessed with the back of highlighters I
had always loved champagne pop opal all
of them I've tried them all they were
amazing until I used this highlighter it
is the Too Faced love light highlighter
and my shade is ray of light it comes in
cutest rose gold heart container which I
love look how cute this is and then the
inside oh my god look at that I'm
wearing it right now on my face and it
honestly makes you glow from the gods as
Olivia Jade would say so I'm gonna show
you guys because I don't think it does
the justice look at that glow right
there
it's so pigmented and so glowy I am
obsessed with it I love this highlighter
so much you guys need to go out and get
it it is amazing you will thank me later
then I just wanted to talk about two
skin care products that I've been loving
recently and the first one is this
Jurgens hydrating coconut moisturizer oh
my goodness
ah it smells amazing I love this product
so much my favorite is just taking a
shower and getting all clean and then
putting this on and smelling like
coconut in just how it really nourishes
your body and moisturizes into you oh my
gosh there's no better feeling than
putting this moisturizer on and then
putting on a comfy grey t-shirt in sweat
pants it smells amazing it makes you
feel amazing my skin has never felt that
our honestly I feel like it makes me
glow the jargons moisturizer is amazing
and honestly ever since I started using
it I will not go back to any of the old
ones that I used to use next I wanted to
talk about one of my favorite face
moisturizers and that is the progenitor
I demand C intensive brightening day
cream I only wear this during the day I
will open up the top and then take my
middle finger and then just dab it on my
face and rub it all in and this is a
vitamin C moisturizer so it will
brighten your skin and even out your
skin tone and get rid of any
imperfections dark circles things like
that I have been loving this product
right now honestly everybody has been
coming up to me and telling me that my
face has been looking so good lately and
my skin isn't glowing and it is all the
products that you put on it and drinking
a lot of water eating healthy and just
making sure you're really taking care of
your face and your skin because it does
go a long way I think that ever since I
started using this product honestly my
face has been glowing it has really
taken away all of the redness and the
discoloration and it's just made my skin
tone so even so I will be including this
in one of my get ready with me videos
just showing you how my face looks in
the morning without makeup on and just
kind of showing you what it looks like
because it has never looked better it's
so even and I
love this product it is so even and it
is all thanks to this moisturizer last
but not least I want to talk about this
brand of products that I've been
completely obsessed with lately
if you saw my everyday makeup routine
video you'll see that I used a lot of
these products in it and that is the one
and only fancy Beauty collection I am
obsessed with it I have four items from
the front II collection I have the
foundation right here and then I have
the primer I have a set of match sticks
and I also have the translucent powder i
love the fenty products so much I think
that they are amazing and honestly feels
like you're not wearing anything on your
face it is so weightless I'm wearing
them all right now and I don't feel like
I'm wearing any makeup at all you know
sometimes when you put makeup on in the
morning and then you wear it all day and
your face feels so dirty you just can't
wait to take off your makeup using the
Fendi products I have never felt like
that before ever so the first thing I do
when I'm doing my makeup is I just use
the primer you honestly need a pea-sized
of it this is the soft matte Pro filter
primer and it just comes in this glass
bottle like this the next product that I
have is the Fendi beautiful nation and
this is the pro filter soft matte long
wear foundation and I am in the shade
260 I get a lot of questions about what
shade I wear and I am into 60 I got
matched at Sephora when I bought this
product one of the employees just took
the shade that I was in in my o'the old
foundation which was the Naked Skin
Foundation and I think I was 5.0 in that
one and then they just typed it in the
computer and then it came up with my
exact match for the 51 so I do recommend
if you are looking to get the fancy
foundation that you go to the store and
you get matched before you order
anything don't get it online I would
definitely go in and get it matched to
your exact skin tone because you don't
want it to be a different color than
your neck that just wouldn't look good
you definitely want it to match your
actual skin tone the next products that
I have from Fenty that I've been loving
are just the matchstick trio and
it comes in the shades tripping which is
a highlighter bamboo which is the
under-eye concealer and everything like
that and then mocha which is contouring
I think that these products are perfect
honestly you can just throw them in your
bag and if you need to touch up your
face during the day all of these are
what you would need if you needed to
touch up your makeup really quickly you
can just throw them in your bag and then
put on some highlighter if you needed it
fix your contour anything like that so I
have been absolutely loving these and
finally I just switched over I was on
the Laura Mercier bandwagon but I
switched to the invisi matte belonging
powder and this is in the shade
universal I don't know if that really
means anything it's just what it says on
the back and it comes in just this
little white container and that's the
powder right there and then obviously it
just has a little mirror but I love this
so much I just think that I was using
the fenty primer foundation matchsticks
obviously all of that with the warmer
see a powder over it and I don't think
that they mix together I don't think
that their formulas worked well together
it felt really cakey on my face it felt
really dry and I started to be able to
see my under-eye powder so I just wanted
to switch over to the Fenty translucent
powder and I have no complaints I loved
it so much and I highly recommend all of
the Fenty products Rihanna did an
amazing job with her beauty line and
honestly out of all of the different
companies that I've used her products
are they honestly feel so lightweight on
my skin and just make it feel really
good and I feel like they don't clog my
pores either I don't feel like I'm gonna
break out if I wear a makeup for a long
time or I just don't feel like that her
products kind of strip away the colors
on your face I really don't know if that
makes any sense I don't know what I'm
saying but basically I just love her
products so much and one of my friends
actually said that the products make
your face feel like liquid silk and amen
to that
shout out Morgan booth it does make your
face feel like liquid silk it feels so
good and it kind of just gives you like
that flawless look and that concludes my
fall beauty favorites and the things
that I am loving right now I hope you
