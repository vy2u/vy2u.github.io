today's video is just something
different than I've normally done before
and as you know if you follow me on
Instagram or snapchat or anything like
that you will know that I was sick with
strep all last week so I couldn't do
anything I really just had to rest and
relax
so by this day I was just so done with
being sick that I decided I would pamper
myself a little bit so I just wanted to
show you guys my sick morning routine
and as you can see right now I just woke
up I'm just laying in bed like going
through my phone going through Instagram
and things like that just checking up on
the world the first thing I do when I
get up in the morning even if I'm really
really sick is I always have to make my
bed I feel like my day is just way more
productive when I make my bed so that's
what I'm gonna be doing right now and my
bed sheets are just from Pottery Barn
and those big palm leaf pillows are from
Target now I'm gonna be making my
favorite breakfast ever which is two
pieces of Ezekiel bread and two
scrambled eggs and I'm just gonna spray
this coconut oil cooking spray from
Trader Joe's on the pan and then whip up
my eggs a little bit as you can see
which is pretty self-explanatory I just
kind of put them in the pan and move
them around
then after mitosis is done I'm just
gonna be putting some raspberry
preserves on top its kind of similar
like to a jam type thing but yeah that
one is my favorite so I'm just gonna put
that on top of my toast and then I'm
just gonna bring all that stuff into my
room and sit down at my desk and start
doing some work I'm gonna be just
replying to all my emails right now and
going on tumblr and replying to some
questions and linking things for you
guys
answering some questions on my videos
just everything that I usually do right
when I wake up in the morning I like to
check a lot of my notifications and just
respond back to you guys and really
engage with all my followers it's one of
my favorite things to do then I'm gonna
be taking a shower and I'm just showing
you the products that I use right now my
shampoo conditioner cleanser and things
like that so when I get out of the
shower I just spray my hair with this
Pantene detangler spray and then I use
my wet brush and brush out my whole
entire head of hair which is kind of a
lot I really have so much hair but one
fun fact about me is that my hair is
naturally straight so all I really have
to do is brush it out like that and then
let it air dry and then it just dries
naturally straight
after I'm done brushing my hair I'm just
gonna have two of my favorite hair skin
and nails gummies and this just really
helps strengthen my nails and things
like that so I eat two of those and then
head on into my Beauty drawer and grab
my favorite face mask and it's the
origins clear improvement active
charcoal mask I love this mask so much
so I'm just gonna be putting a little
headband on my hair to keep my hair out
of my face while I apply the mask and
then just using a clean makeup brush and
applying that all over my face this mask
is one of my favorites it really makes
your face feel cool I don't know if you
guys know what I'm talking about but it
just makes your face feel so much colder
and it really is so refreshing and good
for your skin so this one is my absolute
favorite I highly recommend it then when
I'm done I'm just going to go back into
the kitchen and pour a huge glass of
water and I'm also gonna be having this
little vitamin C packet as well just to
help boost my immune system because as
you know that I'm sick it's just so
important to stay hydrated so I'm gonna
be at bringing both of those back into
my room and drinking that well I just
chill but before that I'm gonna be
lighting a few of my favorite candles I
have this vanilla pumpkin one that I
just got from Trader Joe's it literally
smells so amazing I literally want to
eat it it's the most perfect fall candle
and I also feel like the Trader Joe's
candles burn really well and they really
give off a strong scent so yeah I just
really am loving this candle right now
so I'm gonna go ahead and burn that one
and then of course like my favorite
Anthropologie candle as well once I have
both of the candles going I'm just gonna
grab my laptop and get into bed and just
get ready to rest all day because you I
cannot stress it enough when you are
sick your body needs rest and you really
should be giving it the rest that it
needs so I highly recommend just getting
in bed and hanging out relaxing doing
nothing all day and allowing yourself to
get better
I hope you guys enjoyed my sick morning
routine and I will see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
