rush this morning Gretchen I like we're
doing a bunch of video stuff last night
we were up until like 3:45 we had to get
up at 7:00 so this morning was just a
really huge rush for both of us I didn't
like feel like I had any time to vlog
which is okay because we literally just
got in to Florence and it's the morning
so Gretchen and I are gonna walk around
and find a little cute place to get
breakfast and you need coffee
but today's outfit I think all of you
guys are gonna be asking even in my
pictures I don't know like where to like
I don't know where this is from I
literally got it yesterday
in um Verona but I got this really cute
like nude it's kind of like an oatmeal
colored maxi dress and I paired it with
my white Gucci bag and my Gucci slides
because I was gonna wear the Mary birch
oh it's a midi dress in between I feel
like it's like oh yeah it's like a long
mini or maybe I'm just short compared to
these tall lean European ladies but
anyway it looks so good because like
with my gold jewelry and the gold
sunglasses and tan I just like love
neutral colors so yeah but like I was
saying before I got it in a little store
in Verona but if I can find a link to
their website and see if you can like
buy stuff or even see if they have a
website I look at the tags later like
when I upload this video and I will let
you guys know guys we found shake
and this is the alfie Boe place and it's
so cute I cannot wait to see my god
- of course I have to take a snapchat
but I'm gonna try it right now wow this
seems like it's a good call heavy spoon
it's the same material as Nicole but I
got the dragon free run and then there
is fresh like homemade granola bananas
strawberries and coconut I got it with
coconut water so I'm gonna try it right
now you know it isn't Gretch I gotta say
is yours good I really like better than
you I feel like they're so good because
the fruit is so fresh here so it's like
so much better and everything's fresh
like the granola is like obviously the
coke and I just think there's like no
preservatives on anything which makes it
like so much better okay
so much more
so yummy so we just finished up
breakfast and like I was saying I told
Gretchen that I feel so different after
eating not just because we haven't like
eaten anything like that all trip we've
just been eating like pasta and bread
and pizza and literally just all Italian
food like our breakfast the past a
couple days have been croissants and so
it was so nice to like eat something
from home like I was saying before it
was just so fresh like you never would
have thought like Evils would be good
and Italy just because that's so like
not what you have when you like come
here they were so so so good so if you
guys are ever important to me to let me
know how you like it on Instagram like
semi master or whatever and actually one
of you guys who watched my videos like
to DM to me and told me about it and I
don't think actually like I need to go
back and look because I don't think I
replied because I just like like to go
through them really quickly I was like
rushing around and like when I see if
people say like oh you have to go here
then all I look at it but whoever
recommended that to us seriously thank
you because it is so good
guys we just got to the Gucci Museum
since it's like created in Florence and
so Marcus if you're watching this I'm
going to be thinking of you the whole
time so I think we're going to go inside
we don't know like what the deal is and
like if you have to pay and stuff so
we're gonna go check that out right now
oh my god wait so they just let us in
this is so cool I went to the garden of
love and saw what I never had seen
that's interesting wait so what is this
I don't I'm so confused so it is a
museum nod Marcus but for the job
but there's like stuff in here that has
like yeah look I think we can go
upstairs and there's like all the places
we can like take pictures
touch him up I want to score so that
oh my god mark is in Lille next time we
have like a birthday weekend
these are the ropes are gonna wear
we just went into the Gucci garden it
was so cool Marcus would have been like
freaking out the whole entire time I
feel like everything in there was so in
his bag I wish like I could have been
there with him but the museum wasn't oh
the what like freaking Secret Service oh
there's a private party upstairs right
now at the Museum who's there I don't
know but there's like somebody upstairs
carnism because there's literally so
many guards outside and we like try to
go upstairs and the guy was like no no
no like it's closed and the lady said
something she was like no like it's
gonna be open tomorrow like closed for a
private party and we were like what and
they're here like okay like whatever so
we left but there's definitely someone
like more important upstairs because
like we didn't go up there so whatever
but it's super busy right now
and town I think that there's like a
soccer game
our tour guide was telling us a statue
but yeah so now we're gonna go try to
find like the long strip of all of the
stores and just do some shopping I
actually just bought a bikini from just
in a little store that I saw I'll show
you guys we are going to
I'm a cool place tomorrow where we
needed a bathing suit and I literally
didn't bring any bathing suits with me
the person who over packs for every
single trip didn't pack
and I are in Weiss towel right now
trying on these little teeny bags and we
both were like wait where's our phone
I'm gonna take a snapshot and we both
put them inside just because we feel
like this is the perfect bag for going
out at night because we can fit our
phone in it and literally it has a slot
for your cards in your ID so and then it
just like clicks and you have everything
on you when you're out like look how
convenient that is and you don't even
feel like you're wearing anything so
everything is right there you don't have
to worry about like holding anything in
your pockets so I know if I see this bag
I love you guys get me out of this
country I want this so bad
see like this is even cute with this
dress I hate myself but I love this
which I just feel like it's so I need it
