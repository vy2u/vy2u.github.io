so oh my god it's really important that
it I can barely see but it is Wednesday
June 13th and it's around like 10:50
a.m.
Gretchen and I decided to sleep in a
little bit today just because we've been
getting back slowly and like so busy and
so tired from running around and doing
everything these past couple of days
it's been so much fun so we were just
like okay we need to like let ourselves
rest too and sleep in a little bit cuz
last night in the night before both of
us were stick we stayed up really really
late until like 3:30 o'clock 3:30
o'clock see how tired I am until like
3:00 in the morning because we were like
trying to get all of our like videos
edited and up and everything like that
just to like keep you guys updated
because we know that you guys have been
waiting to see all of our vlogs and
stuff so we like wanted to make that a
priority
so we stayed up a little bit later but
and then it's okay because we got to
sleep in today which was really nice and
Gretchen still like laying in bed right
now but I like actually got up and got
ready and I'm gonna go grab a coffee
just down that's a little like main
building place but we're staying at our
hotel but today I'm wearing as free
people little bra at top we'll have
everything linked down below that I'm
wearing like always and I'm also wearing
this Zara skirt which is really cute I
just got it and I was like a little
ruffle on the bottom I don't know if you
can see and I'm wearing my Gucci slides
but I got this skirt from Zara yesterday
you guys will see it in my Italy haul
I'm gonna include it in that video so
yeah like I was saying I'm just going to
get a little coffee now this little pool
at our hotel and I want to go down here
into like the coffee bar
I don't know how to get down there and I
just walked up to the main building and
I think I have to walk all the way back
around to get there which I guess is
okay look who's finally took the shuttle
into Florence what we're seeing
influence but like right outside of the
actual city like on the outskirts
so we have to take a little shuttle so
that is exactly what we did this morning
oh sorry we just took the shuttle into
Florence now we have a little bit of a
walk but it's okay it's so nice out
today
finally there's like a little like
breathe you know
humid like it's not human at all I'm not
even sweating and my hair just feels
really nice and I don't know we're gonna
have a great day
we have a free day in Florence I don't
know if I said that to you guys before
that's why we slept in a little bit
because we knew that we had a free day
so we like stayed up for a little and
like did a bunch of work and stuff and
then slept in now we're gonna go get our
very healthy breakfast spend the day
here and then we came in a little bit
later as well you have breakfast lunch
so we came in a little bit later because
we want to be able to stay later and
then have dinner here and not be like
burnt out and tired by the end of the
day I love how they have cute like
stands that you just walk up to on the
side of the road here like a little
snack bar that's so if you can
side and eat your gelato like grab a
coffee or whatever another thing that I
think is really cool that people do here
is that you get a coffee and then you
don't like take it to go like I was
saying earlier but I think it's so cool
that they also just stand at the
counters and drink it
I like above that and today I got a
coffee to go and I drank it out of the
cardboard cut but they gave me and I was
like no wonder the people in Italy don't
like drinking out of these car broke up
because it like made my coffee tea
spirit and I feel like coffee just
tastes so much better when it's in like
a glass bugger like a collage cup I
don't know if I'm weird I just I can
love coffee and I feel like it actually
does taste so much better when you taste
it when you drink it out of like a
normal mug Gretchen and I please know we
were obsessed with shake yesterday wait
why is there this side shake away oh
that one's like you don't take it away
this sneak away and then we can actually
eat there so this is where we were
yesterday you would have seen in
yesterday's vlog if you didn't see
yesterday's vlog I'll have it linked
down below for you guys today I got the
vegan wrap and then I also got this
little juice in it is tumeric Cayenne
ginger lemon in the mountain
and it's so good and refreshing like
this is exactly what I needed and then
Gretchen and I are gonna share like The
Rasmus Island and we thought a tofu
salad and it has like a bunch of fresh
veggies and they're like I'm not so
sesame dressing it smells really good
and then she also gotta chop screw salt
which looks amazing
we just got to Zara and I'm in the
fitting room and this are like I was
telling you guys yesterday it's so big
it's like literally three floors and
that's how I got this skirt yesterday
but I have all these clothes and I'm
gonna try on and I'm gonna show you guys
because I found the cutest stuff like
this stuff is so my vibe and I feel like
lately I've been like struggling to find
stuff to wear during the summer just
because I don't have a lot of things
that I really liked that much and I
thought think that these are the coolest
knickers ever but sorry about this noise
there is like a big vent on the ceiling
but I just thought that this dresser was
so big and I think recho might come in
here with me I'm gonna text her right
now but so I'm gonna hurt all these up
on and show you guys like what I like
and stuff and a few pieces of that are
really cute and yeah okay so this is one
of the dresses that I really like and
it's like a body con mini dress but it's
so big on me because I got inside to
bake and there's no smaller sizes other
than this one so I'm probably just not
gonna get it and then I also tried on
this shirt right here and it's so cute
so I think I'm gonna get that and then
I'm gonna get this romper all this stuff
is a know I might get this because I can
I get too cute like to wear out to
dinner if I'm like with Tyler's parents
because I have a lot of like cute tops
but they're really cropped and they need
to like start getting stuff that's like
classy that I can wear like around
adults and all this stuff is a no guys I
am so obsessed with this - I knew I
would be we wanted this just me gonna
bring when I turn
Oh Cameron okay I might as well take
this moment to say thanks for watching
Maggie and yours we love you and she
loves you and I love her and Italy's
amazing and thank you when you're
watching this I love you so much I
didn't want to be here if anyone else
for having so much fun as I can't wait
to look at these memories when we're
like a V and we'll have looking products
to look at that's like my favorite thing
about
people get memories and just capturing
fun moments like right now we're just
having some fun in our free day in
Florence yes okay is our trip and for
some reason I never have good luck at
this are at home but for some reason
here like I can find such cute stuff and
also we met a subscriber yesterday in
Zara we also met another girl when we
were eating at shake and she was so nice
and we met her friend it was her
friend's birthday today where should we
go now Gretchen us
Pantalone I don't know why we both have
to go to laughing so we're gonna try to
find a bathroom now and just walk around
it's like a really chill day I really
like being so relaxed and stuff here not
having to be on a tight schedule I just
feel like we have so much more time to
explore and enjoy things like I'm
shopping in some ways this isn't my
favorite drink
ever right now there's a buffet oh eight
euros and a buffet
so Gretchen and I it just got drinks and
I got a spread which is literally gone
now
I'm so good I can kinda still taste it
on the bottom but there's literally so
good I don't know we have them in the
state well I mean like two houses but
I've never like heard of it it's not
like a common drink that people get when
they go out which I wish it was because
it's so good but I feel like it's kind
of an acquired taste like Gretchen hates
them like she doesn't like them at all
they've a really bitter after like I
don't like sweet drinks and she like
loves sabato and she loves like sangria
for a second always like the leaf sweet
I can go but these are literally my
favorite in the whole entire world but
more people need to start with making
them in New Boston than the river from
or I need to just like create it on my
own at home but I wish that got like
more places had them on the case because
I used to work at a place called
Wisconsin it's like a resort on the Cape
and I feel like this drink would be so
popular there because people come from
all over and like a lot of people are
born and do come from Europe and I feel
like if they had maybe browse first
Google would be obsessed with it
but yeah I just started raining now to
me to help the guys open see how they
have a what today I'm open for or did
you ready - oh I didn't tell them like
you can walk around I could literally
get this to go and like walk around with
it no I mean like that's like there's no
open container what is open before was
what so you told us that like like so of
this there's my pocket okay there's Jen
right yeah open or and measure it out or
like they know cuz they've done it so
much my hair though just a claw and so
usually he's like when you get like four
or five drinks in America here you got
it - you can literally get later - and
like my awesome you own music pouring
and pouring and pouring the box yeah
we're looking you're like what yeah I
was really wondering here yeah now we're
looking at the dessert menu and we just
noticed like I always forget they don't
give you a check here like unless you
ask for one so this is where we are
actually this is good that I like see
the name it's called I'm not even trying
to pronounce it but chubby it's on the
other side of the carousel that we were
at yesterday they don't bring it over to
you they want you to like to sit here
and chill like everybody in here like
these ladies have been there for so long
everybody else is just been like sitting
and they have really long lunches which
i think is really really cool and we
just came to the brandy and I feel like
Emma would love this sweatshirt
we put into our phone we Capri plays in
a public rate premiers totes that you
guys funny on the street and we are like
we are ones where is this place you can
find it and I honestly this kind of look
like there but baby daily change the
neighborhood thing we couldn't find it
you're like looking up see where it is
and on Yelp the last person that wrote
about it was April 7 years ago really no
that's definitely not here anymore
so but we found this only
yeah look it came to my tirado
Gretchen loves this one it's actually
very good all stacked up like that it's
very well
after trying literally three flavors
like core of the gelato I finally got
the Oreo and it's so good and then we
both got units how the crepes and you
got and we're back at the Gucci garden
which is like the Museum the Gucci
Museum you guys would have seen this in
yesterday's vlog like a little bit of
the bottom floor but we haven't been
upstairs yet rich and we're gonna go to
tears right now about it's literally so
cool
so we got our tickets and they also gave
us this map on the back so I guess like
this is not everything is this is so
cool follow me show you guys around
everywhere once we give our tickets to
us
we just got done in the museum I wasn't
really talking that much because I
didn't want to disturb all the other
people but look how cool this Gucci
garden like items are look how cool they
are this is so cool I put this phone
keys on my phone and I kind of want to
get it I don't know if you can get it oh
my god that's me that even let's give
you sort of mm-hmm Gretchen's like
obsessing or he's Chuck fees in these
bowls she wants like Instagram them but
wait olive oil yeah I was gonna say this
is actually really good they give us
chickpeas with like a tiny bit of olive
oil I was like our appetizer I guess
instead of bread and it's actually
really good I was like well together
with why would they do that but it's
super simple and I mean my god fusilli
with oil and garlic and some
and then Gretchen got that one which I
wish I had that one and you wish you had
this one
yeah that's sure but obviously the
camera eaters
no literally off on this whole trip we
like take photos of everything that are
which is getting us fresh ground cheese
touching that you just order dessert
whoa because we're like okay if we're in
Italy like we need to try everything we
can since when are we going to be back
here like they had a cannoli and I think
we should just like
because I think it's not the same as mad
as it is at home and also we got these
little tart and I'll show you guys which
if they should be here please see our
other girls right here believe you
jumpsuit
thank you
yes that toys and that's Gretchen's
little Nutella thing thank you
and then I got forgotten thank you I'm
excited to try this we all time we've
been here is that Margie I think so and
we asked our waitress what her favorite
thing was on the dessert menu and it was
this but she likes him to tell when I've
got apricot you got change abroad and
tell her you're like obsessed with
Nutella I feel like
and I like Africa because this is what
was in my cannoli I mean my wait what
was that thing called not I can only not
a crepe Chris on my croissant on the
first day so I guess the cannolis are
more like frosting and then they are in
America and early days across more mood
announcer Gretchen said I'm gonna take a
piece of it yeah
coming to grips America
peejoe
this is so pretty right now I love how
they have this ferris wheel right next
to the arch I wish I could take a
boomerang on my phone but my phone's
about to die it's on one we need to try
to get back um but if you guys want to
know what Gretchen and I do at night
literally why because I just uploaded my
new vlog from yesterday and I'm gonna
edit this vlog and try to get it done
but I'm gonna do some of it tomorrow on
the bus cuz you have a long bus ride to
Rome but look what time it is 12:09
a.m. uh and it's so hard to like upload
videos because we literally have to use
the hotspot on our phones because
there's such bad Wi-Fi but I just wanted
to end off the vlog of my camera's ever
gonna focus on my face okay but I'm
gonna end off the vlog um Gretchen I
actually packed up tonight for tomorrow
a surprise
yeah me too because the last time we had
to pack up we didn't do it until the
morning I mean it took us so long and it
was just a mess up we packed up tight
which is good but I'm very hungry so I
really want to try to like go get a
snack or something and I'm also like
losing eyelash extension so I just made
an appointment to that wink I'm gonna
