me and Brooke EB over here we are going
it's right now 1122 and at 12 o'clock we
are getting tattoos so I'm gonna bring
you guys along with me I'm getting my
first tattoo honestly I've thought long
and hard about this I never in a million
years would have thought that I would
ever have ever gotten a tattoo but this
is just something that means so much to
me and you guys will see why like once
you see what my tattoo is but basically
they have been thinking about it for so
long and I'm so excited so I'm gonna
bring you along with me today and right
now we're gonna go get a coffee and
stuff and then go get them so let's get
it so I've we're on our way inside I
keep wanting to call it a tattoo I mean
it's hands
put the tattoo place and I'm gonna get
my first statue I'm so nervous
chill LaVon what you're getting so this
is Brooks oh well this is Brooke EB I'm
getting the word strengthen yourself on
I think a lot cities yeah look at her
cutie with the adidas with the Digga
skirt that's our vibe right now but what
I'm getting is obviously
the nerve
I'm in the chair and are waiting
yes I like that do you like it yeah 100
cent positive because I like it a lot
you do yeah we gonna send it I wouldn't
get it no I think that's a perfect my
god
Maggie send it what do you mean what's
gonna look great you're fine ready
I feel like not see my event
that's nice I like scratch
I really like it
Maggie got her first this is the finish
was all of my little tattoo as you can
see it's just a lowercase e because my
sister's name is Emma so I got this
tattoo for her and when she gets old
enough she's gonna get a little M on her
wrist but that's what it looks like and
I'm so happy with the way that I came
out honestly it didn't even hurt at all
and kind of just felt like something was
digging into your skin and like almost
scratching you but now it just like
feels like a little paper cut it really
doesn't feel like anything at all and so
what yeah this tattoo obviously is just
something that's been like really
meaningful to me for a really long time
obviously Emma's my sister and she's my
best friend we do everything together
she'll always be there for me we'll
always be there for each other like I
just wanted to get this for her because
I don't know I just feel like she's like
the person that's always gonna be there
for me in my life she's my house the
best friend so I just really thought
that if I was gonna get a tattoo that it
was gonna be something meaningful like
this but I do think that this is my only
tattoo I'm not gonna get anything else I
really don't think that there's anything
else in my life that like would mean as
much to me as my sister does so yeah I
just wanted to share this whole entire
experience with you guys and if you have
any questions just leave them down below
and thank you so much for watching this
vlog I will see you guys in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
