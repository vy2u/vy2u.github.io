today's video I just decided that I was
going to do a little uLTA Beauty haul
for you I recently went to Ulta and I
picked up a few things
I have tried out all these products so I
have only good things to say about them
I'm obsessed with all of them that's why
I decided to take this time and just
share them with you because I truly
believe that these products are amazing
I will have all of these items linked
down below and without further ado let's
get started the first item I want to
talk about is just this palette from
Tarte it is called the make magic happen
palette and this is an eyeshadow palette
this is what the box or you can see my
camera but this is what the little
packaging looks like and then inside it
just has a giant mirror but these are
all of the shades that it comes with
they are so pigmented and so glowy I use
this palette mixed with the next one I'm
going to show you for Halloween and
that's how I got that really glowy look
that you guys all saw the next palette
that I got is the Too Faced natural eye
shadow collection palette this box is so
cute I just think that it is so like
clean looking and sleek inside and then
when you open it up it has three
different rows of different eye shadow
looks that you could use but I usually
like to like mix-and-match them they
have like a de a classic and a fashion
look and these are all really just
neutral and glowy shades which is the
same as the Tarte palette that I got I
just really like glowy gold natural nude
makeup looks right now so I thought that
these palettes were absolutely perfect
for that if you want me to do a tutorial
using these palettes just give this
video a thumbs up to let me know the
next thing I got from Ulta is just the
Anastasia Beverly Hills brow is
obviously if you guys watching youtube
videos you know everybody uses this it's
everybody's holy grail I got it in the
shade soft brown which just goes with my
eyebrows I don't really use an eyebrow
pencil but I thought that if I got this
and I would
using it I've heard nothing but great
things about it and I have used it a few
times I have it on my face right now I
do really like it a lot so I'm really
excited that I picked this up and the
next two items I got are just some lip
products the first one is this mini
peach lip balm by the brand Tony moly
and it just comes in this really really
cute peach emoji looking container I'm
gonna open it up I've used it a few
times I think that it smells so good I
need to go back and get the lotion
because it's also amazing and it's one
of the ones where you have to dip your
finger in and then put it on so usually
I like to use this like when I'm at home
right after I gather the shower like in
the morning things like that because I
don't like to use them when I'm in
public and my hands are touching all
these germy things everywhere but so I
got that one and the next lip product I
got is just the glam glow pout mud wet
lip balm treatment and it comes in this
big silver sphere right here and then
again it just opens up and the lip
treatment is inside it is super
hydrating super nourishing and glowy
like it just gives you like a nice sheen
on your lips mmm and it smells amazing -
it's really really minty which I love
especially for this time of year when
the weather starts getting colder out
and you start getting a lot more dry I
just feel like when things are minty and
like thick and nourishing and creamy
just feels so much better on your lips
so I'm absolutely obsessed with this
right now and last but not least the
last item oh my god I was loving this
for Halloween weekends if you guys saw
all of my Instagram pictures that I
posted up all my outfits my skin was
literally glowing from the gods and it
is because of this product right here I
do not know what I would do without it
honestly it's one of the best products
that I've ever used and it is the laura
geller new york baked body frosting face
into body glow guys it comes in this
little gold container and it comes with
this applicator brush then it also comes
with a little body like
sponge thingy I don't really know what
to call that but when I open this up you
guys are gonna freak oh my god look at
that it is just the most glowy
highlighter ever and especially with
this applicator right here you literally
just rub it in and then you can rub it
all over your body you can even use it
on your face too I put a little bit on
my cheeks and the tip of my nose but oh
my gosh I love this so so so so much
this whole thing was 40 I think around
$40 and this will last forever it is the
most amazing glow it really gives you
the best glowy natural like sunkissed
look I'm so obsessed with it and I
highly recommend it to everybody
seriously go out there and buy this you
guys would be obsessed you would love it
and it will be your new Holy Grail so if
that concludes my little Ulsan beauty
haul if you guys enjoyed this video give
this a thumbs up if you liked seeing
haul videos and just seeing what I
bought honestly I have a shopping
problem I have an addiction it's really
bad so I always go shopping and like
pick up little things here and there
that I probably don't need so if you
