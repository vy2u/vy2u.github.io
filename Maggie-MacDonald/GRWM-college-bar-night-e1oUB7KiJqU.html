this video is gonna be a get ready with
me I'm gonna be going out tonight in
college to the bar so I just thought
that I would get ready with you guys
show you guys my outfit show you guys
how we do my makeup do a little chit
chat kind of like girl the girl as if we
were hanging out getting ready together
and I've never done anything like this
on my channel before so leave a comment
down below if it is something that you
guys enjoyed don't forget to subscribe
if you're new here and without further
ado let's get started so I'm gonna start
doing my makeup to go out to start off I
don't know what I'm wearing yet usually
I don't pick out like what I'm wearing
until I make this completely done just
because for me at least I feel like when
I try on clothes and I don't have any
makeup on and they throws off the whole
outfit so I don't know I just feel like
that's just me but I'm gonna start off
with the Too Faced hangover primer and
it smells so good it smells like
coconuts and I really need like a
moisturizer or like a primer that's
gonna hydrate and moisturize my face so
what this is the one I'm gonna use and I
feel like it works really well like this
used to be my oh gee when I used to use
it all the time and I've recently
started using it again they absolutely
love it and I will have all of the links
to the products down below in the
description for you guys so it's super
easy for you to go through and like find
them if you want to get them and then my
foundation that I use is just the Urban
Decay Naked skin foundation in the shade
of 4.5 and so I'm going to be using this
Real Techniques like Beauty Blender dupe
sponge and I like this one because it's
literally five dollars from Ulta it's so
cheap and it's brown on the bottom
because I used it last night to apply
self-tanner to my face that's why my
face looks really tan my throat kind of
hurts right now that's why I'm like
talking kind of weird and the dog that
lives downstairs is barking right now I
don't know why we're not even supposed
to have dogs in my building but the
people who live fall and we have a dog
so I have no idea like how that works or
like why they get to have a dog
but whatever so I'm just gonna be using
this damp Real Techniques sponge like I
just said to blend all of my foundation
out I'm really not like a makeup guru or
like I don't really know like what I'm
doing but I just kind of like winged it
and my eyebrows are really really bad
right now like I don't know if you can
see but I haven't gotten my eyebrows
done in a really long time so yeah
that's really about it should probably
do that tomorrow and also I don't know
how good the lighting isn't gonna be in
this video I feel like it's gonna bother
a lot of you guys just because like I
feel like it's really right in the
background and you can't see me right
now like it really washes on my face I
need to get like a ring light or
something and I also need to put my hair
up Mayer elastic is all the way I got
these little like hair um
springy things the other day from Urban
Outfitters so I'm just gonna use that to
put my hair back in a little like a bun
thing looks awful but that's what I'm
gonna have to do right now and now I
have to go in with some concealer and
I'm just gonna be using the offensive
match stick in the shade bamboo and all
I do is I literally just put it
underneath my eyes like that then put
some down my nose and then forehead
Cupid's bow chin nose like I just said
oh my god they're like magnetic school
and they literally just like went
together
my makeup is everywhere right now
because I don't have like a set filming
area in my room right now at school it's
gonna be so much easier when I go home
for the summer and then I have like a
filming room and we're gonna be doing
like a lot of videos together and stuff
so that'll be really nice but
yes and I feel like I'm not gonna call
this like a tutorial I think I'm just
gonna do like a get ready with me
because I mean that's really what it is
I don't really know how did you make up
that well so I don't know I guess like
you can take some of these tips if you
guys want to like you use them but I'm
like awful at makeup I don't really like
know what I'm doing I'm kind of just
like winging it so I'm gonna take the
matchstick beyefendi
in the shade mocha and then just draw a
line like right underneath my cheekbone
and then along my chin I usually don't
use a cream contour but lately I've been
like forgetting to do when I go out so I
wanted to like do something funky
tonight just because it's like the last
night that people are going out at
school so I thought I would like to do
something funky plus I literally never
wear makeup so I wanted to like switch
things up and I'm just gonna blend it
out like this I've got the longest day
ever today's Friday right yeah Friday
May 4th and it's my best friend Molly's
birthday and we're going on Sunday to
brunch me Molly a bunch of her friends
from school and also my friend Graydon
from home like me and all my friends
from high school are gonna go and I'm
really excited like I'm also excited to
be home on the Cape for the summer with
my friends because I haven't seen them
in so long I feel like when I go to
school we like lose track of our friends
from home just because like you're so
busy at school like with school friends
social life like all of that stuff that
you can get like really really crazy so
I'm happy to finally go home and see my
friends again and like get to catch up
with them and stuff that'll be really
nice and I'll also be vlogging with them
a lot because I'm gonna be like hanging
out with them but usually I get ready
and I thought it wasn't focused again
usually I get ready and I play music and
stuff but I feel like with music playing
the background you guys would like I've
annoyed so I decided not to do that
today
and now I'm gonna set my face with a
Fendi setting powder I feel like I'm
like getting sick or something I don't
know why like my voice is like this oh
but um what I was saying before I got
distracted
I am really tired today
see how they can't even speak cause I'm
so tired but I'm so tired because I went
with Tyler back to his town like where
he lives he lives in North Andover
Massachusetts if you guys like know
where that is um and he's moving to a
different house so like we helped his
parents like move a ton of their stuff
and we were there for like a really long
time I think from like what we left at 9
from school and took like an hour and 15
minutes so we've out there like we left
on 9:15 because I have to take shower
but we got there like 10:30 and then we
ended up leaving around like 4 o'clock
but we were there super late so I'm just
like really really exhausted but I still
I'm gonna go out with my friends because
it's like the last weekend at school and
I know a lot of my friends are going out
so I wanted to like go out and be with
them but now I'm just gonna bronze my
face using this big fluffy brush by Real
Techniques and also my benefit hoola
bronzer see I can't even speak because
I'm so drained and tired from finals and
a lot of people have been asking me like
oh my god Maggie what are your study
routines and like um what do you do to
like study for finals and stuff and I
literally don't like do anything which
is so bad like I just read over like my
notes and like the study guides that the
teachers gift if they give us any guide
and I kind of just like wing it but a
lot of my finals are papers or projects
they're not necessarily all like sit
down multiple-choice except for my one
management final which I had a study
guide for so that was good this
literally feels weird to be wearing
makeup right now in front of the camera
because I don't wear makeup like ever I
can't tell the lighting is so weird in
my room and I can't tell if like my face
looks
wait my friend just snapchatted me Oh
God Brooke out Michiyo just sent a
snapchat to our like a little group
message me Gretchen and Danielle she's
so funny I love them so much I feel like
it's so weird that I need these people
may end up actually being my good
friends even though like we all do like
the same thing we make youtube videos
like as you guys know Gretchen is my
best friend but like her and I would
genuinely be like good friends if even
if we didn't do YouTube like we were
friends ever before all of this like
YouTube stuff I came up but like seeing
with Brooke and Danielle like I would
get along with them even if we all like
didn't do YouTube but we talked about
that all the time
how we're like real-life friends oh I'm
just using the Kat Von D shade and light
palette with these two like darker
shades I'm kind of trying to highlight
my face a little bit more like define my
cheekbones and my jawline I think I'm
going to edit this video tomorrow and
like upload it right away just because
I'm getting back on my grind of
uploading every single day because I
uploaded two vlogs these past two days
cuz I've been super sick lately like I
told you guys like from Coachella and
stuff like I just was so drained and I
had finals and now that everything's
like starting to like get back to normal
I'm gonna be uploading a ton I'm so
excited and now I'm gonna use the banana
shade and just put it like underneath my
eyes like brighten it up a little bit I
don't even know if that looks good about
whatever
we need chaps they coming up the Bert's
visa I usually use the vanilla bean one
it's like a weird consistency right now
and it also doesn't smell or like not
taste but it like isn't vanilla bean I
know I don't know if it's like Burt's
Bees is like going through a phase
or they just got too popular about it
they can make it differently but I like
hasn't been the same lately so I'm using
aqua for on my lips right now and
usually I don't like to do blush just
because I don't know I feel like
sometimes it like doesn make my face
look the way that I wanted to I don't
know I kind of like this one I haven't
used this blush in a long time
it's the Tarte blush in the shade
glisten I used to be obsessed with this
blush because I don't know if you can
see how like shimmery and rosy it is but
I just feel like it gives your face like
a really nice glow because I actually
used to use the Tarte blush in the shade
party but I think that's more wintery
and that's probably why I didn't like it
last time I wore it because it was like
- Matt I never wear makeup so I feel
like Tyler's gonna see me tonight and be
like oh my god you look so different cuz
every time we hang out I don't wear any
makeup at all and like when I hang out
with my friends it's really weird I
don't know I guess that's good because
now like when I do put makeup on I look
at myself and I'm like wow like I like
look not like saying I look good but I
like look better than I do like I don't
makeup you know what I mean like never
mind cuz I feel like I'm never a makeup
someone you do wear makeup and I look
myself it's like I don't know I like
like it cuz I'm like not used to it oh
my god I was supposed to whiten my teeth
8:56 I think don't have time yeah I do
I'm gonna put them in right put them on
because I need my teeth I've been like
on a whitening grind lately and I'm
using the whitening strips that are the
CBS brand if you guys have like a CVS
pharmacy near you I use the 14-day
treatment ones and they just look
like this and I don't know I just don't
like the crust once I think they're way
too overpriced these ones are like $20
and my teeth they feel really white but
I can't smile my tea so I can't link
show you guys but look at them they're
so white so I'm gonna get on and you
leave them on for a half hour and I'm
supposed to go to Tyler's house like
before we go out but um but how I'm
gonna make it over in time if I'm ready
I need to text him the most important
part this whole stuff is highlighting
your face or this whole tutorial get rid
of me I don't even know I'm like
delusional right now because I'm so
tired this is the Too Faced highlighter
in the shade ray of light and then I'm
also like a highlight beam so I use the
Laura Geller just like big huge
highlighter in the shade you go I did
glow like love looking like really glowy
um but yeah I don't know if I should
wear eyeliner tonight I don't know if I
am if I'm gonna
but I'm using the naked 2 palette and
I'm using half-baked all over my eyelid
and I do the same like a makeup look
when I go out every single week but um
yeah I really don't really switch it up
that much a lot of people were
commenting on my camera do used me for
Coachella and they were like I hate when
you tap your brush on the side of your
like thing to get all the excess powder
off of it and like I was watching my
baby and I was like whoo yeah that's
wicked annoying so I'm sorry I did that
I also need to get an eyelash fell soon
so I'm gonna make an appointment for
that I can't see the lighting is so bad
in my room Rome everybody also says that
I save room instead of room which i
think is funny one of my friends from
schools from New Jersey and he says
water instead of water I think that's
the funniest thing ever
he's like water can I have a water and
we're all like yeah sure you can have a
water okay
now I'm gonna use I use this mini little
Urban Decay eyeshadow in the color shade
chase just in like my this area right
here outer corner crease whatever you
want to call that like don't even know
makeup terms but I just do it like that
and just kind of like adds like a little
like definition in your eye yes I think
I look crazy right now because like I
can't see myself but I'm like not doing
anything too crazy today I'm just doing
something a little bit natural and like
glowy because I really don't feel like
doing anything more so yeah
I'm like excited for this video to go up
I don't know how it's gonna turn out or
if you guys are even gonna like it or if
you're gonna be like you're literally so
annoying because it's kind of weird
sitting here alone and getting ready
like with all my friends but like
talking to the camera just because like
it's not until has like no purpose just
kind of like getting ready with you guys
as if you are one of my friends but I
guess since I'm 21 if you guys are 21
and you're watching on my video what do
you guys drink when you go to the bar
because I'm always trying to like buying
different things to drink usually I get
a vodka soda with two lemons and like
it's so disgusting oh my god I'm not
even tracking how long I've been having
you help me teeth i J come off at 9:25
it's 9:02 okay good um but usually I
drink a vodka soda with two lemons just
because I like hate the taste and the
two lemons like makes it a lot stronger
and like tastes like lemon and I don't
know like what else to drink I don't
like vodka cranberries because I don't
like drinking juice when I know that
it's like not real juice like a juice
that you've got if it's like
fresh-squeezed or anything like that so
like I never know what to get and I
don't like tequila I love wine but like
I can't go to the bar and like drinking
wine when I'm with my friends so I don't
know I don't know what to do because I
don't know like this summer if I go out
if they're gonna have like different
drinks on the Cape because I've never
gone to the bar on the Cape
so because obviously I just turned 21
when I was not when I was I turned 21 in
the winter in November so I haven't like
been able to go out anywhere at home
with my friends but I'm excited to do
that and like go with my friend
Catherine cuz she's been 21 forever and
like her and I had been talking about
going out like when we're talking went
together for a really long time but I
don't know like what else you do too
Amica I don't know if I should put
eyeliner on I can't see myself right now
I like keep adding stuff to this
but I think it's done finally almond
lips I'm just using the NYX butter gloss
in the shade fortune cookie it's like my
absolute favorite it's $5 and it's so
good and creamy and I love the way that
it looks when I'm tan like in the summer
time I think it's a really nice like a
neutral color and also it's really
really cheap which I love
so yeah I think this is the finished
makeup look for when I go out it never
changes I literally do this look every
single time and I'll have all like the
product side of using some link down
below if you guys but now I need to pick
it up a little bit okay I really have to
go but I just want to show you guys
quickly like what I'm wearing in my
accessories and stuff so I ended up
putting on eyeliner just because okay
this lighting is weird cuz my makeup
doesn't look like this in real life but
I've been on eyeliner just because I
don't know I just feel like I was going
out like I look super plain but this is
my outfit I'm wearing this forever 21
bodysuit I'll have it linked down below
for you guys also these Abercrombie
jeans and these black strappy heels not
strappy like one strap heel from Target
they look like this so yeah this is just
what I'm wearing out tonight super
casual I didn't really know like what to
wear I don't like have any clothes for
this time of year I feel like it's like
a weird time and like the weather's
weird and just like the vibe is weird I
was gonna wear a skirt then I was like I
don't want to but I think I'm gonna wear
one of these layered gold necklaces I
actually want to wear this one right
here it has like this little diamond
like longer layer thing so I'm gonna put
this on right now I don't know if I'm
