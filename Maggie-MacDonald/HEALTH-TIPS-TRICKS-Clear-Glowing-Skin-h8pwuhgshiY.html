do a little health and like wellness
care video and I don't know I just felt
like if I've logged it that it would be
a lot more personal and you guys could
like relate to it a lot more and I'd be
getting a ton of questions lately on
like my skincare routine and how I keep
my skin so clear it's not really that
clear right now which is something that
I wanted to like address and also you
guys always comment about how my hair is
looking so healthy and shiny all the
time so I want to talk about that and
like show you guys what I use for like
my hair care routine and everything so I
just got out of the shower as you can
see my hair is still a little bit damp
but I just wanted to go through like my
process bring you guys along with me
show you everything that I do and share
some of my tips and tricks with you guys
so yeah I hope that you guys enjoy this
video and without further ado what let's
get started
the lighting in my bathroom was really
bad but I just wanted to show you guys
my shampoo and conditioner that I use
and so this is the shampoo and it's the
Paul Mitchell tea tree shampoo and you
can get it online or at the drugstore I
believe I got mine from Roche Brothers
which is kind of like a grocery store or
like a little market and then I just use
the same tea tree conditioner and I
really like this one
it's really good for your scalp and it's
for all hair types I know that I read it
on the back and so I just really like
this one it smells really minty and this
is what I've been using lately I used to
use Pantene but some of you guys were
like don't use Pantene it's so bad for
you so I switched over to this and I
really really liked it so far so if you
guys try it out or you use it let me
know in the comments below how you like
it and I know that they also come with
like a lemongrass one and lavender so I
might try that one out once I'm done
with this and after I get out of the
shower I always just take my Pantene
serious repair mist detangle or spray
and you can get this at any drugstore as
well and I spray it all over my head and
make sure I get it all throughout my
hair and then I take this wet brush and
brush it out to get all the knots and
stuff out of my hair and I just feel
like if I use it to tangler spray it's a
lot more smooth than if I don't and I
feel like when I don't use one and I
brush my hair my brush like rip rips
through my hair and then causes my hair
to get dead ends which I don't recommend
doing so that's why I just feel like
it's so much easier to brush through
when you have a detangler spray so
that's basically what I do with my hair
when I get out of the shower
and a big tip that I have for you guys
that I think is one of the biggest
reasons why my hair is so like smooth
and shiny and healthy all the time
is because I don't use heat on it and I
have naturally straight hair this is
just how my hair is all the time I
feed on it I don't own a straightener I
don't own a blow-dryer I just washed my
hair with the shampoo and get to sure
that I showed you guys previous lead in
the beginning of this video and then I
just go through and spray up my Pantene
detangler spray in it and then brush it
out with a dry brush wet brush and let
it air dry and like I was talking about
in the beginning of the video my skin
has been so weird lately like I'm
breaking out on the side right here and
then also on my forehead and I don't
know why because I'm using the same skin
care products I drink a lot of water
I eat relatively healthy like 90 percent
of the time
85 if I'm being generous I don't eat
like rarely anything bad not because
like I don't want to genuinely because I
do enjoy healthy food and I'm just so
used to it and I makes me feel so good
so yeah but I can go into detail about
that like in a different video like all
about like what are you eating a day and
stuff like that if you guys want I know
that you guys have been interested in
seeing something like that so I'll
definitely be doing that for you guys
but my skin is like freaking out and I
don't know why and like my stomach cuz
I'm feeling weird lately and I've just
been like really bloated so I just
wanted to start like taking some dietary
supplements and like some vitamins and
stuff just because I want to be like the
best healthiest version of myself so
over spring break Kaylee and I went to
Whole Foods and she was being like
getting really about stomachaches and
she was so bloated and so she got these
digestive enzymes and they worked really
well like I took a few and I was there
like I wasn't bloated at all I was like
wow this is amazing so I went to Whole
Foods the other day like when I was by
myself
and I was like walking through the
vitamin aisle and I don't know if you
guys can relate to this too but I was
literally standing there and it's all of
the little different vitamins and
supplements in front of you and there
were so many and I was like oh my god I
don't like know where to start I don't
know what any of these mean like I had
no idea like what to do and I got so
overwhelmed so I was like you know what
I'm just gonna leave because like I'm
over it and I don't have the time for
that or like the energy or the attention
span to like look at all of these I got
so stressed out I was like I don't even
know what I need what my body wants like
all I know is that I just want to work
on like my digestive system and
like my skin and looking like glowy
ingredient and all of that I was like I
don't I don't have time for this and
then I found out about Kara I was on
visco and I saw a picture of one of
these little vitamin packets and had the
girl's name on it and it had different
vitamins in it and I was like wait what
is that
so basically what it is it's a website
where you can take a five-minute quiz
and then it'll personalize your vitamin
packs to whatever like you want to
improve within your health so if you
guys have like any dietary restrictions
like if you're vegan you can take
different supplements to like help give
your body the nutrients that you need
that you're not getting because you are
on a vegan diet or vegetarian like
whatever it may be so basically what you
do is you take a quiz and it's so cool
literally takes five minutes and it
personalizes your package of vitamins to
whatever you want to prove in your
health so right now I'm just gonna go
through and fill it out so I'm
definitely curious about what vitamins I
want to take and I know that I want to
definitely help out my skin and my like
digestive system and also I don't really
even know
have you taken vitamins or supplements
in the past nope so basically you just
go through and answer all of these
questions which are pretty
self-explanatory I'm not interested in
being a parent
so I just finished the quiz and I put in
all the information about like my health
goals and my diet and it gave me all of
these recommendations that I should take
a digestive enzyme and then it shows
like why you should and all of like the
ingredients and the benefits of a
digestive enzyme and then it's also
telling me that I should take vitamin D
and then this thing right here which is
supposed to help with your skin which I
really need right now and then also a
probiotic blend which is going to
support my digestion and help me be less
bloated and stuff like that so yeah
basically now it's done and I'm gonna
order the vitamins and just wait for
them to come in the mail and then start
taking these daily to improve my health
so I ended up editing out like with a
pack of vitamins that I'm getting and I
ended up just ordering a digestive
enzyme a program it blend and a vitamin
D supplement so I didn't want to do the
one for your skin just because I have a
dermatologist appointment on Tuesday and
I just want to like ask my dermatologist
of what does she do about my skin before
like putting anything into my body just
because I don't know like why I'm
breaking out like this I give it has
something to do with like something that
I don't realize but I've been really
trying to like keep up with like my
laundry and stuff just to make sure that
it's like not anything that I am like
doing wrong so I've been like trying to
keep my bed really clean lately and
something that's so important to have
like to do to have clear skin is washing
your sheets I know that you guys may not
like realize that just because it's
something
that just seems so like obvious and that
you may forget about but I wash my bed
sheets every I think it's like week and
a half to two weeks and I wash my
pillowcases once a week or as often as I
can I just wash them the other day and
they're super soft and cozy just because
at night I'm like you're sleeping on
your bed and like you're sweating you
get hot and I don't know I think it's
really gross and also I try to take a
shower before I get into bed every
single night even if it's just like
rinsing my body off just because I don't
want to like transfer all of like the
bacteria and like germs into my bed and
then sleep with it all night there's
like that's really disgusting and gross
so yeah but I'm just like having a
really chill day today and I'm gonna do
some laundry right now and like switch
it over just to like get it done and
have clean clothes because something
else that I'm so weird about is that I
don't rewire sweatshirts more than once
just because I feel like I don't know I
feel like if I wear a sweatshirt more
than once then it's gonna be all like
dirty on the sleeves and then if I like
touch my face I don't write like a weird
like feeling that it's gonna like make
me break out or something
so I just did a bunch of laundry and now
I'm gonna put it in the dryer and I
think that was it I just did big load
the other day actually nope I just did a
big little laundry the other day and so
now I'm just gonna do like all my light
stuff and I keep my darks and my lights
separate just because I have like a
bunch of white stuff in here that I
don't want like any of the dark colors
to transfer onto
and my skincare is definitely one of my
favorite things to do every single day I
feel like I just like to take time and
like take care of my skin and just
really make sure that I can get it to be
as like glowy and clear as possible so I
do the same thing every single day I've
been using these products for a little
while now and I just really like them in
the way that they make my skin feel and
I like how radiant it looks and
everything like that so first what I do
before doing any of my skincare I put my
hair up in a bun just because I don't
want it in my face while I'm like doing
all this stuff so I just throw it up in
a messy bun and then I'm gonna take a
cotton pad you guys have probably seen
this and make a few of my vlogs and
stuff before of just me showing you like
what I do and I just take my fresh rose
floral toner and put it on a cotton pad
wipe it all over my skin
and it's so important to go down your
neck as well just because I don't know I
feel like whatever is on your face
definitely goes down into your neck and
applying these products on your neck as
well it's gonna help prevent wrinkles
when you're older then for the next step
I go in with my Olli Hendrix in a truth
serum and put one little pump of that on
my hand and then I'm just gonna rub it
around and apply it all over my face and
as well down into my neck like I did
before and then to finish off I'm going
to be using the Neutrogena oil-free
moisture to skin face moisturizer and
just putting a little pea-sized on my
hand rubbing it around and applying that
all over my face as well
I use the oil-free Neutrogena one just
because I have eyelash extensions so I
can't use any products that have oil in
them but something that I did used to
always use which I really liked and I
felt like helped my skin be really clear
was this Heslington apothecary facial
oil and if you don't have eyelash
extensions and can use a facial oil I
highly recommend doing that just because
at night time like before you go to bed
after your face is all clean your
makeups off it just feels so fresh and
refreshing to put an oil on your face
and then wake up in the morning I feel
like my face always felt so good and
honestly I really miss using a facial
oil and I don't know if you can still
use them if you don't have if you do
have eyelash extensions just because I
know a lot of people like still use
products that have oil in them just
because you're not directly putting it
on your eyes so I really should ask the
girl that does my eyelashes but if you
know the answer to that and you know
what that I can still use a facial oil
or if I shouldn't or whatever if you
have any information about that leave
and in the comments down below because
I'm really curious to find out because I
really miss using my facial oil so now
that I just finished up with my skincare
routine I'm gonna go into the kitchen
and fill up my water bottle and I'm just
using this plastic one liter Poland
spring bottle right now because I just
bought this water this morning before I
went to the gym and I'm just gonna reuse
it just because I want to drink another
liter of water I've already had one
today and usually I use my swell bottle
which is right here I think it's 17
ounces I know it says it on the bottom
yeah 17 ounces but I feel like when I
drink those I don't get as much water
and as I need to because I'm always
having to refill it so I'm just gonna
use this one right now and fill it up so
now that that is full I'm gonna drink
that but if you guys don't have a water
filter like this where you live if
you're a college student like in your
apartment and obviously if you live in a
dorm like you're not gonna have a
filtered water thing in your fridge but
I just think that a nice way to have
water all the time is definitely
investing in a Brita and we used this
before we got our water being set up in
our fridge right when we moved in so I
was like wait what are we gonna do for
water because I hated to have to always
buy cases of water so Katie and I got a
Brita and this is nice to have like on
your counter just because like it's so
easy to just fill up your water bottle
with it and make sure that you get
really really hydrated throughout the
day so I think I'm gonna end off this
vlog here just because I have to drive
Tyler to the airport soon and yeah its
2:54 I have to go to this house by 3
o'clock so I have to get going for that
I'm gonna like get dressed and stuff
just because I'm wearing like my comfy
clothes right now and so I just want to
end off the vlog here I hope that you
