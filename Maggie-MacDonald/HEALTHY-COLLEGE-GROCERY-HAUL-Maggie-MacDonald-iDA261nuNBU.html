love actually it doesn't make sense I'm
excited for it
hey guys welcome back to my channel in
today's video I'm gonna be showing you
guys all of the things that I've just
bought at the grocery store I get so
many DM the questions on tumblr snapchat
all my social medias about what I eat in
college and what I find at the grocery
store so I thought what better day to do
a virgin haul video than today I just
learned shopping for the first time in
my new apartment so I'm so excited I
have so many things that I just thought
I can't wait to share them with you guys
so without further ado let's get started
I have to look big backups throw the
Trader Joe's that I'm going to unpack
and show you what I got
okay so first starting off with the
first bag right here so just follow
first
I just thought cage-free brown eggs I
like to have to support us every single
morning the second things that I saw I
got some peanut butter from pretzels the
unsalted one I like to have these first
snack just whatever I want like
something scooter just like a little
treat these are my absolute favorite
from the Ritter Jodie and I guess the
unsalted ones because if I get the
salted ones they literally are so
addicting I will eat the whole entire
bag so I always always always get the
unsalted ones but these are amazing that
I highly recommend them next I just got
a little bunch of bananas and like to
have bananas like when I'm on the go
things like that just like when I was
heading up the door like going to class
or going to the gym and it's almost a
powder Fatima's and then at the bottom
of the bag it just
a little thing organic sweet potatoes
they talk to you so I can make them for
dinner I'm gonna start prepping all of
the wheels so I just think I decided
that I was going to have to potatoes
with my dinner and two potatoes are a
really good source of herbs they're also
really really good for you so I Kelly's
house and then going into this big bag
right here this is the biggest the two
of them I got some whole wheat English
muffins I also like to help me is as a
snack with just some peanut butter all
those and since like Spinney or not I'm
above then I brought three peaches
and right here I've got some all-natural
chicken breasts I'm gonna make these for
dinner and then have it with sweet
potato and some of the veggies that I
got so I got these cockroaches and then
the next thing in the bag is my favorite
of all time it is the current light
sprouted thank you bread and it's the
cinnamon reason one oh my god guys this
bread is so good it's not like regular
bread I know that I think it does pack
flour in it and it's just like all
sprouted grains it's so so good for you
but when you put this in the toaster
it gets so crunchy I don't even want
anything on I just eat it with scrambled
eggs clean but it's amazing this is my
favorite of all time
they come in they have so many different
ones they have like flax on the sesame
one multigrain just so so many different
ones but this one's definitely my
favorite
so I hide once you guys have your bread
I swear to god they'll thank me later
you will never go back to regular bread
ever ever ever that I just bought some
organic green beans I'm gonna cut these
off Bob with the chickens into the table
for my dinner so I got these
and I also got some organic frozen
broccoli this is nice because if it's
frozen it's often a little bad and just
keep it in the freezer and it won't be
fresh for as long as you need it to be
you'll have to worry about using it
right away which is good the next things
I thought were just some ground black
pepper and pink Himalayan salt I use
these to kind of spice up whatever I'm
eating I'll put a little bit of salt
pepper my chickens anything like that so
I really like the pink Himalayan salt
and better because it's a lot better for
you than regular salt and then I just
got ground pepper because you really
just like pepper I've kind of a pepper
person if that makes any sense
whatever on everything the next thing I
got is just a full grain that Dijon
mustard I'm gonna put this on my chicken
it's really good for only five calories
per serving which is a teaspoon and I'll
just take a teaspoon of it and put it on
top of my chicken to like give it some
flavor if I really want to spice things
up a little bit so I love love love it
my sister and I are so obsessed with
each other containers and the next thing
I thought is just as organic crunchy
peanut butter nice unsalted and usually
whenever I have to do better I'll have
it on one of these muffins that I got or
with the banana but I love peanut butter
it's always so nice to have this and I'd
like to keep it in the fridge because
right now it's like kind of watery and
if you keep in the fridge just literally
gets hard and then when you put it on to
like a warm English muffin it melts so
nicely and it's so good and I've also
got some coconut oil cooking spray this
is the only thing that I use when I cook
I just spray it on my pan and I'm gonna
make eggs or like really need anything
that it's gonna stick to my pan I always
use the coconut oils from Trader Joe's
then I got my awesome favorite it's just
this organic popcorn I know stuff some
popcorn when I was 12 during this summer
makes at certain high wikibook one every
single late use checked each other if
you like popcorn question mark and then
she's like five minutes let me make
popcorn so I love having this it's just
an easy snacks out at nighttime or
whenever I have something really really
late I'll just take like a tablespoon of
this and put it in the pan and then
spray some coconut oil and then it'll
pop tell me to put some sea salt on it
whatever I'm feeling but I just love
having this snack I think that it is
great and also it was super cheap it was
like a dollar fifty for this big thing
and it has 22 servings in it so I really
think that this is practical then I just
got some organic jasmine rice I got this
to go with my chicken and veggies when I
have dinner I think I'm gonna do one
night I'll have jasmine rice and then
the next I'll have sweet potato and I'll
kind of switch off so I'm going to do
that and this you can keep the freezer
so again it will don't go bad and then
to think you just microwaved a minute
the only ingredients in it are cokes
forget it guys
so without fight like that because
there's no additives no nothing just
clean and it's a good of hard to hop
because you can't really go last but not
least last things on the bottom of the
bag are these little
Organic Greek non-fat yogurt it's just
plain I like to put a little bit of
honey and cinnamon in mine I don't like
to get them are too sweet it was like
the blueberry raspberry flavors like
those because they do add sweeteners in
it and they put sugar and the fruit
obviously isn't real fruit so just kind
of got to I like to stay away from those
I really really do like the plain ones
and where we go over is so good for you
so I always like to have these on the
girl in the class before the gym stuff
like that very handy to always have and
yeah I also made a stop at Target
because there was a target right near
the Trader Joe's that I went to and I
bought Tupperware's because like I was
saying I'm gonna start meal prepping so
I just got two things
and then target my boss these two glass
jars I got this one right here that I'm
gonna make my own sake input into the
British with so I have this one and then
I also have this on the top right here
that I'm gonna put all my power and I'm
gonna put all the popcorn kernels in it
just to keep them from like falling onto
the bag it stops as I feel like if I put
that back there
why Topsy's and now I am just away
get religious
Oh
how much that I got and my total was
sixty to sixty-five Trader Joe's is the
cheapest grocery store ever
I like to go there rather than going to
like one of the bigger person stores
near my school just because like I find
them to be so expensive I go there and
there's some peanut butters like six
dollars and just the prices are
ridiculous just because they're
comedians in the area I'd rather taken
some extra time let's make a day trip
and go to Trader Joe's and first time
Trader Joe's near you seriously after we
go if you're in college it's perfect
it's so so so affordable and they have
amazing food Beasley prices I love them
