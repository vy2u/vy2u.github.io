that I would do a little I don't know if
like this would be considered like a
vlog but I'm gonna be showing you guys
what I'm gonna get at the grocery store
I need to go get food my fridge is
literally update I don't have anything
and yeah so I'm gonna take you guys
along with me and show you guys what I
get at the grocery store
I usually typically get the same things
every single week I don't really like
get anything different but you guys will
see what I get
I'm just gonna go to one of the local
grocery stores here I usually go to
Trader Joe's but the closest one is like
30 minutes and I don't really feel like
driving that far today so I'm just gonna
go to one of the runs one of Italy ones
right down the street so yeah let's get
started my god this is literally so
bright in my face but I just got back
from the grocery store I got a few
things I spent like $30 but I will go
inside and like unpack that and show you
guys what I got but I'm so excited
because I'm so hungry and I really
needed food I literally had nothing but
yeah all my friends are busy today and
I'm sad I won't hang out with them so I
just like got a bunch of errands and
stuff done today but let's go back
inside and I will show you what I got oh
these are my bags right here I got I
really didn't get that much stuff but
they put them in three separate bags I
don't want to know why I'm going to show
you what is inside so I'm gonna show you
guys when I got at the grocery store
today the first bag right here I just
got a little thing of bananas I usually
like to have bananas like in the morning
meal or in the afternoon if I have like
a little ghost muffin with peanut butter
I'll put sliced banana on top so I've
got little mini bananas then I got a bag
of red apples I just got three of them
these are great snacks are always having
the fridge like on the go to grab and go
they're very nutritious and love apples
then I got two cucumbers
so that bag is selling and now I'm going
to the second bag oh I got two things of
fresh raspberries I like to have these
on Greek yogurt I just eat the plain
non-fat yogurt and I'll just put like a
few raspberries on top to give it that
extra sweetness and flavor then I also
got some tomatoes just three tomatoes on
the vine I like to cut these up with the
cucumber and then put like balsamic
vinegar on them that's one of my
favorite things to eat ever and then
I've got a thing of just brown eggs
these are regular large brown eggs I
have two eggs every single morning with
Ezekiel bread scrambled and so I just
have to get more eyes cuz they just ran
out then I thought oh I got the late
100-calorie Thomas English muffins again
like I was saying I like to toast these
and put like peanut butter with sliced
Adana or sometimes I like to have like
raspberry jam on them those are just
quick and easy I like those and then I
got some sun-dried tomato basil hummus
and this is just the Cedars something's
wet in my bag but this is just the
Cedars brand and it just comes in this
little container like that so I like to
have that usually I have like cut-up
peppers and some carrots in my fridge
and usually like cucumbers and stuff and
I'll just eat that for the quick snack
then I got some low-fat cottage cheese I
don't normally get this but I was like
in a weird mood night kind of craved it
so I got this it's a great snack to have
it's filled with protein and there are
only 80 calories per little thing not
that calories matter but like for guys
that
the last thing that I got is just this
box of Olivia's organic spinach just in
case if I want to like put it in my
scrambled eggs if I want to make like a
salad or anything it's I always like to
have on these boxes on hand so yeah that
is all that was so quick but I just
thought that like since I get so many
questions about what I buy at the
grocery store I always post a snap shot
usually on my cart and like a bunch of
screenshots so I just thought might as
well go through all the facts that I
have and show you guys every individual
thing that I got again like I was saying
I only spent around $30 if grocery store
was not expensive at all I just try to
get like the necessities and a big tip
that I have when going to the grocery
store is to always shop the perimeter of
the grocery store because if you really
think of it that's where all the foods
are that are good for you once you go
into the aisles down the middle that's
where you got all of the processed foods
and all the things that just aren't good
for you so I shop the perimeter I like
to go and like the fresh section with
the fruits of vegetables I like to go in
like the yogurt section and yeah you get
the gist so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video give it a thumbs up if you would
like to see a video of what I eat in a
day I can show you guys what I eat as a
college student throughout my whole
entire day so if you would like to see
that give this video a thumbs up and I
will see you tomorrow bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
