went to Ulta really quick I got a few
things there I went with my broom II and
I'm gonna show you guys that in a second
but we're gonna go to the gym right now
we literally like don't know like what
else to do we're so bored because it's
the first week of classes at my school
so we really like don't have that much
homework or anything in the classes are
super short it's just basically like the
teacher going over your syllabus but
we're getting ready to go to the gym and
I just wanted to get a little snack
before I work out because it's so
important just to like eat before your
workout I know for me at least like I
can't work out unless I eat something
before so I am just gonna be having one
of my favorite rx bars you guys don't
know what they are I'm gonna show you
and tell you a little bit about them and
this is the box that they come in and
they are gluten free soy free dairy free
there's no added sugar and no BS I
absolutely love these protein bars
because I feel like when you eat protein
bars other brands they have so many
different additives and sugars and stuff
like that and I really just don't like
that at all so basically all the
ingredients are what is on the front so
this one is chocolate and sea salt and
it literally has three egg whites six
almonds four cashews two dates and no BS
obviously because that's all that there
is inside and they literally taste the
way that they sound like this one
literally tastes like chocolate and see
something they're so easy you can just
put one in your bag and then bring it
with you and they actually keep you full
for really long and look how many
different flavors they come in like they
have and that mixed berry I love this
one right here this one is peanut butter
that one's my favorite I also love the
chocolate peanut butter one and then
this one is chocolate and sea salt they
also have coconut chocolate and then
blueberry so this one is my absolute
favorite the blueberry in the peanut
butter right here but I'm so excited to
try all these other ones and thank you
to our X bar for sponsoring this video
for 25% off of your first order if you
guys want to try the RX bars you can
visit our X bar comm slash Maggie
and use the code Maggie they have so
many different flavors you guys are
gonna be absolutely absolutely obsessed
if you're looking for like a healthy
snack or whatever if you're in school
you can bring these to college to bring
them to class with you and just pop them
in your bag they're super easy and all
the flavors are so so so good my
favorite
is the peanut butter and also the
blueberry one right here so I think
today I'm gonna have the blueberry one
and I'm gonna get ready to go to the gym
right now and then I will check back in
with you guys when I get back and I also
just got back from Ulta I gotten a few
things I just want to show you guys so I
absolutely love the naked 2 palette and
I'm going to show you like what my
palette looks like right now because I
was having the biggest struggle when I
was at Ulta if you guys saw my snapchat
like you would have known when I was
talking about so basically I just tried
out every single like bronzy brown
eyeshadow that I thought was gonna match
the suspects one because this is my
palette right here as you can see you
can tell which one's my favorite and
suspect is my absolute favorite and I
used all of it and they don't
individually sell suspect at Ulta so I
have to buy one that was like identical
to it and it is called what's it called
chase so I got that in order to replace
this one because I literally use that
with half baked and then I use snakebite
and that's what I do when I go out but I
didn't find the suspect one so I have to
get this one instead oh and then I also
got one of the NYX intense butter
glosses
and this one is in t shade cherry
custard I want to try this up to see
what it looks like but I really really
love the NYX butter glosses you guys
know that but I'm obsessed with the next
fortune cookie lip gloss and it's so
amazing it's like the perfect nude pink
color and honestly they're only $5 so
that's why they're so good and I feel
like I've tried so many high-end lip
glosses like I used to wear the Mac one
I've tried like tar I've tried so many
and all of them just make my lips feel
like sticky if that makes any sense like
I don't know why I just they just don't
go on nicely they're not like creamy I
really really really like the next one
so I wanted to get this one because I
like wearing different colors when I go
out so I just thought that getting like
a bright red pinky color would be fun
also because I feel like I have a lot of
red lip glosses but they're also matte
and I hate that on myself so I'm really
excited to try this one out now I need
to change and go to the gym this is
literally one of them wearing all day
you guys don't let
sweatpants on my absolute favorite they
are my brandy melville sweatpants and
then I'm just wearing my little Stan
Smith's with Emma's brandy melville crop
sweatshirt she's gonna see this in be
like oh my god Maggie like he took my
sweater
but it was in my bag from California and
then I have my LA hat on because this
house is my favorite you guys know I
used to always wear my blue LA hat but
then I just felt like I don't know I
love red Red's my absolute favorite
color so I had to be the red one when I
was in LA and it was perfect because I
was in LA and that's like where I got it
so it's kind of like meaningful now no
people can stop asking me like oh my god
you like the LA Dodgers because no i
don'ti truly like the Hat and I love LA
so oh and I also got my roommate one
from LA - and it's so cute if she wears
it I will show you guys what it looks
like because it's so cute it was so hard
so when I saw it I was like yes I need
to get this far because her and I always
wear the blue ones so I just thought
that it was appropriate to get to that
since I was in LA as you guys know so
now I need to get ready to go to the gym
another thing that I noticed is that my
closet has so much stuff in it and I
brought so much with me to California
you guys know that my bag was like over
50 pounds and it's so bad because I
don't wear half the clothes that I own
so I'm going to be posting a ton on
Poshmark coming up because I have way
too much stuff so I need to get ready
for the gym now I really have been
wanting to wear these leggings like I
didn't bring them with me to California
and I like missed them a lot so I think
when I wear these and I'll probably wear
these and then I need a sports bra maybe
aware every 21 I'm ready to have a good
workout and I have to vlog so that's my
roommate right there but this is what
I'm wearing to the gym I changed my
whole entire or the one I picked out so
I'm just wearing these blue aligns with
my forever 21 favorite sports bra this
alo jacket my wireless beats that I've
missed oh so very much when I was in
California I didn't have them and then
my nmds so I need to grab my chapstick
my phone where's my wallet I just got
back from the gym and I went with Kaylee
there she is right back
there I need to like introduce her in a
video we need to redo the roommate tag
because we did that so long ago then it
was like yeah and I got to lead it by
accident one night I was at her work
with her and I was like on my computer
like tried to do something with my
videos and like change like this thing
and it accidentally deleted my roommate
tag so if you guys want to see roommate
tech video give this video a thumbs up
but I just want to show you guys what I
got at the store because you guys are
usually like interested in what I get
when I go grocery shopping so I just got
two bags
chicka pop because this is like my
favorite little snack treat thing to
have I just get the regular sea salt
plain one it's like my favorite ever and
then I also got some light 100 calorie
multigrain English muffins and I love
eating those with a banana and peanut
butter on them and then they just buy
what are those those are from a
dishwasher then there are some baby
carrots in Europe because I love to have
those first snack and then I also got
some bananas to put on top of the
English muffins then I just got a few of
the plain Chobani Greek yogurts and I
get the plain ones because honestly all
of the ones that are like different
flavors like blueberry and strawberry
they all have like added sugars in them
and like I was saying before I don't
like anything with added sugars that's
why I eat my little rx bars over there
because there's no added sugar and I'd
rather just put plain like cut up fruit
into it that didn't make any sense I'd
rather put like fresh cut up fruit in
them then I got some broccoli because
I'm gonna eat grilled chicken with
broccoli tonight for dinner then I also
got a bunch of apples because I love
having apple star snack they are really
satisfying and I feel like if I have one
Apple they keep me full for a while and
then the last thing I got was just some
all-natural chicken because I'm gonna
make chicken for dinner tonight so yeah
that is what I got at the grocery store
so I thought that I would give you guys
like a little after I shower routine or
what like what I do figured out the
shower because everyone's like what do
you do to your hair like what products
you put in it
so this is what I use in my hair after I
shower every single time and it is the
Pantene pro-v serious repair mist
detangler and it just looks like this
and it just comes in this bottle you can
get it at the drugstore and I golike
spray it all over my head make sure to
get it in the ends and then I just take
this wet brush right here and brush it
out and this is literally all I do to my
hair every time and I have to use it to
tangle or because my hair is so like
fine and straight that it like gets
tangled really really easy so I think
you need a detangler or else I won't be
able to brush my hair and honestly like
it helps the brush go through it a lot
better so I'm just gonna brush out my
hair and then you think I'm gonna do a
face mask so I'll show you guys which
one and then after that go into like my
skincare and stuff that I do at
nighttime so now I'm just gonna put my
hair in a bun so I can do a little face
mask so it like keeps it out of my face
and stuff so I don't know which one I'm
gonna use I have these ones right here
from Whole Foods that I really love and
this is just what they look like they
come in these little packages right here
there's a brightening face mask a
luminous face mask I have those and they
also have my origins clear improvement
charcoal mask which I absolutely love I
think I'm in the mood to use one of
these well I'm gonna use this one it's
the instant luminous face mask and it's
just a one-time use and you keep it on
for 10 to 20 minutes and it's supposed
to nourish and energize to illuminate
tone and help smooth texture for an
uplifted appearance that's like what I
need right now ever since I got back
from California my face is like getting
dry again so I'm gonna put on some
chapstick
I feel like I'm like in such a Chau
tired mood right now like I'm still
jet-lagged I swear oh okay I'm gonna
take my brush and apply it with a brush
just because I want to be able to get
all the product I want ladies I'm gonna
use the viewfinder to look at it oh my
god it smells like a creamsicle
literally smells so good so I'm just
gonna apply it all over and since it is
a one-time use because it comes in like
this little package right here I'm gonna
try to like use as much as I can it's
smells so good it smells like one of
those like creamsicle popsicles like
from when you were a little too orange
ones with the cream in the middle they
used to get it like lunchtime at school
if you guys know what I'm talking about
a comment down below okay I need like
even this out it's like getting close
okay so I'm gonna leave this on my face
for 10 to 20 minutes and then once I'm
done with that I'm gonna wash it all off
and show you guys like my nighttime
little skincare routine a type thing so
I just finished the mask and I wanted to
show you guys like I need to take it off
but it like dried clear and it's really
weird cuz like parts of it obviously I
haven't dried yet but they're like still
on my face but I can feel it
like I can with my face cuz it's all
like hardened but it's dried clear I
thought that was really cool so I'm
gonna go wash this off but I will be
right back my face like really does feel
like luminize with a face mask okay so
now I'm gonna take my toner which is the
fresh rose toner and then spray a little
bit of it on a cotton pad and then just
wipe that all over my face just in case
any of the excess like dirt and stuff
that was on my taste during the day just
so that ball comes off and also some of
the face mask that it was just using so
when I go ahead and wipe my face and
then after I'm going to be going in with
my favorite serum ever and it is the
Kensington apothecary Aegis Beauty sea
and I'm sure to put pump of that and rub
that on as well and to finish it all off
I'm just taking some of these Cetaphil
moisturizing lotion just looks like that
I'm gonna be applying not all of my face
and down my neck because it's so
important to moisturize your neck as
well because you don't want to get
wrinkles there when you're older and so
then after that I just apply some
chapstick and I'm gonna be applying the
Burt's Bees strawberry chopstick on my
lips after just two like hydrate them
and moisturize them okay
so now I am done and right now its 6:22
so I have something work to do and stuff
and I'm literally just gonna like hang
out with my roommate Kaylee and go to
bed so I just want to end off the vlog
