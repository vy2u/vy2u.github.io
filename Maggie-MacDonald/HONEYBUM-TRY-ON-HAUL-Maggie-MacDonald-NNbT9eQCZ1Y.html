today's video I am going to be showing
you some things that I recently picked
up from honey bum if you guys have not
heard of honey bum yet it is just an
online store that has a ton of
affordable very trendy going out clothes
and things like that so I just wanted to
sit down and show you guys everything
that I got today I will have everything
linked down below for you guys to check
out without further ado let's get
started so the first thing that I got
from honey bum you guys would have seen
in a recent Instagram post from a couple
weeks ago I'll insert the picture here
but it's just this white v-neck of
bodysuits and it kind of has this high
neck right here oh my god guys this body
suit is literally amazing it looked so
good on I was so surprised by the way
that it looked on me I picked this up in
a size small and I love the material it
is super thick which I like so it's
definitely good for any time of year you
can definitely wear it in the winter as
well as the summer the next item I
picked up from honey bum is just this
nude bodysuit and it is completely sheer
and mesh which I love I am so obsessed
with it wearing this with like a cool
bra underneath and a skirt it's gonna
look so good going out I picked this up
also in a size small and it is just this
nude blush color I am so obsessed with
this I cannot wait to wear it
the next going out shirt I got from
honey bum is just this champagne velvet
kind of tie top it is cropped and it
does tie around your body and then you
can tie it in bow in the front which I
really like I picked this up in a size
small I think that this shirt is perfect
for going out in the wintertime you can
wear it with high-waisted jeans a nice
statement bounce a pair of heels booties
whatever you want I think that this
shirt is super flattering on I love the
way that it fits it's the perfect length
length in the sleeves and when you tie
it around your body just fits you so so
nicely the next thing I got from honey
bub is this green bomber jacket with
this ruched detailing on the sleeves I
love this bomber I got it in a size
small it fits so well so
farmer jackets in the past that I've
tried on I've been super boxy and
oversized which I didn't really like and
this one honestly fits so perfect it has
these gold zippers on the arms which
also just puts a nice touch to the
jacket so if you're like me and you
don't really like looking too boxy when
you're wearing a jacket you should
definitely get this bomber from honey
bum then I just got a pair of pants and
they are these candle print pants and
they have this very cool detailing on
the thighs which I really like
they're super high-waisted usually when
I order pants online like they don't fit
me at all pants fit me so weird but
these ones fit so well there's so I
always say they really suck everything
in and they are the perfect length they
go down to your ankle and they also have
these cute little zippers on the side
which I really really like and the next
thing I picked up are just these joggers
they are plain grey joggers with this
really cool tied detailing all the way
down the side and then they just have
drawstring in the front I picked these
up in a size medium and I got them
because I really like being casual and I
love the athleisure look during the
winter so I just thought that these were
super fun to wear with like a leather
jacket and a tied white t-shirt or tank
top anything like that I just think that
the detailing on the side is super fun
and it really adds something to your
look and lastly for money Bobby picked
up one of their two piece sets and they
are these grey joggers and they have
this waistband that says pretty in Punk
on the top which I don't really like so
I think I'm gonna fold them over and
just wear them normally like this or cut
it off or something but yeah so they're
just these plain gray joggers and then
obviously they're tight at the bottom
they have a little drawstring and they
came with the cutest crop sweatshirt in
the whole world it's just this plain
grey crop sweatshirt with these larger
fell sleeves and then it also has a hood
and then matching strings at the top
this I believe is awesome oh actually I
got the top it is small the bottoms in
hey small Oh so I got this set in a
small sorry but yeah so I just think
that this is so comfortable to wear
around my apartment like when I'm
editing videos and things like that
I didn't own any matching like crop
sweatshirts to my sweat pants so I
wanted to get one of these and honey bum
has the cutest sets ever you guys should
totally check them out so what that
concludes my little haul video today I
