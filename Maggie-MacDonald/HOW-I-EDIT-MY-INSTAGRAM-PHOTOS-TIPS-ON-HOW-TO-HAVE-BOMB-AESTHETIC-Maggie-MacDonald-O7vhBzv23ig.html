today's that was weird
I don't worry did that whatever
hey guys welcome back to my channel in
today's video I just wanted to share
with you as you can see by the title how
I ended my Instagram pictures and how to
get a bomb Instagram I get so many
questions about this topic and I'm so
excited to share all of my tips and
tricks with you guys so without further
ado let's get started with the video
before I start I just wanted to let you
guys know that since I didn't upload a
video yesterday on Saturday for day six
I'm gonna be uploading to tomorrow on
Monday just because yesterday was a
crazy day and I had a lot going on and I
just could not get to filming and
editing and uploading things like that
so I will have two videos Monday at 9
p.m. so stay tuned so I have my phone
here I just have the iPhone 7 and let's
open this up and to edit my Instagram
photos I use one app I use the app visco
vseo
whatever you call I don't really know
what it's called but that is the app
that I use so I'm going to open up the
visco app and then go into my camera
roll and import a few photos that I'm
going to add it I'll do this one
mmm I'll do that one once I've imported
the two photos that I will be editing
I'm just going to go on to the bottom
where there are those two little lines
and go to choose my filter honestly I
use the same filter on all of my
Instagram photos that is how I get my
feed to all look the same and have the
same aesthetic but that's not the only
tip that I have for making your
Instagram look good and having a theme
I'll go into that later but so far I go
through all the edits and I choose c1 I
don't think that you have to pay for c1
I think that it comes with this go when
you download the app so I'm gonna go
into c1 and I think I'm gonna do around
6.0
that's usually what I do just to make my
skin glow a little bit more and kind of
make the photo pop so once I use c1 on
six point oh I'm going to save the photo
back to my camera roll and re-add it
because I'm going to be putting another
filter on it so now I'm gonna go in with
the filter that I use on all my photos
and to kind of give my Instagram that
same type of look right now it's like a
white warm orange e tone something like
that
so to get that look I use a four and I
know it's gonna make me look so pale and
I kind of have to play around with it
because it does make my skin look really
really white but I'm just gonna turn it
down a little bit so once I am done with
the filter aspect of I don't know if
aspect is the right word once I'm done
playing around with the filters I am
going to go into the tab that just has
all of the little effects that you can
put on the picture and I am going to go
to the grain effect and add a little bit
of grain to the photo just to make it
look a little bit rustic and vintage
looking that's like really my vibe right
now so I'm gonna save it the photo
and then I'm gonna go into the other
picture and just quickly show you how I
edit this one because it has like
different lighting than the other one I
feel like so now I'm just gonna turn
down so you want a lot on this one
because it just will really wash out my
skin and make me look too pale so then
I'm gonna add again going with a four
really turned down a four halfway once
again I'm gonna go back in add some
grain to that baby and save it to my
camera roll now I'm gonna go into the
Instagram app just give you some tips on
how I like to take my photos and how I
like to have the layout of my Instagram
look so as you can see this is just what
my feed looks like right now I'm kind of
going for a more warm toned theme and a
lot of white White's my favorite
love-love-love I'll weigh everything I
swear by that I live by it so I really
like white and I'm really into the warm
tone so as you can see I like to put in
pictures of myself and pictures of
things I don't want it to just all be me
myself all the time and I just don't
want it to be I don't really know how to
describe it but one of my biggest tips
for having your Instagram look put
together and have a theme and just like
a good aesthetic is to really be careful
about what you take your photos in front
of as you can see about my Instagram I
try to take pictures of things that are
white just to make my theme look more
white so as you can see this photo of me
right now I'm just laying in my bed my
sheets are all white and then the
picture of my desk area right here as
you can see all my friend Shores white
my walls are neutral I like to keep
everything neutral and clean looking and
I'm gonna go back into my Instagram see
white brick wall how to add that in
this is a picture of me during the
summer I'm on my friends boat and as you
can see took the picture in front of the
part of the boat that was completely
white so yeah those are my little tips
and tricks on how to get your Instagram
looking bomb and fresh and have a nice
theme the biggest tip that I can give
you guys is just to find and edit that
you like and stick with it I like to
edit my photos all the same way just
like my Instagram to look really clean
and fresh I love the way that it looks
going on and having all of my photos
uniform and just having all the same
filter and really making sure that the
background of my pictures are relatively
the same in all neutral colors another
tip that I have is to take your photos
in natural lighting I cannot express
that enough natural lighting is really
gonna bring out the colors of your skin
it's not gonna wash you out I feel like
when I take pictures with flash they all
just come out bad I don't edit them well
and they all are just I don't know it
just doesn't give me the vibe that I
like but if that's what you like then
that's completely fine everybody has
obviously their own opinions and you can
do whatever works for you
I just personally like to take all my
photos in natural lighting and I like my
backgrounds to be clean and neutral
those are my tips and tricks on how to
get a bomb Instagram and have a good
aesthetic and theme things like that I
