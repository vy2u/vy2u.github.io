it would be finite to film a how I state
that on vacation than like vegetation
workout routine so right now I am going
to the gym and I'm just wearing my
Lululemon sports while these moves on
the pants and my apo cigars but I will
have all of the items that I'm wearing a
link to temple if you guys just because
I know that I'm gonna get a ton of
questions about like where I got
everything you guys usually ask so I
like to link that for you so right now
I'm gonna go into the gym start my
workout than guys on with me and hope
you enjoy
Oh
Oh
so I did 20 minutes no and they just
went from like 6.0 to 7.0 running so I
did that for 20 minutes straighten that
I had a five minute cooldown and then
after that I didn't add workout which I
showed you guys and just so you know I
did that three times they'll have the
like description of the add workout that
he did it below for you guys but yeah
that's my workout for the day and Fe now
I'm gonna go get some breakfast I'll
actually show you guys like what I get
for breakfast this morning just because
it's gonna be something healthy since I
just don't and I feel like you guys are
always like what do I want to eat and
stuff I'm gonna do that and this is my
breakfast this morning grapefruit
honeydew melon grapes and a spinach
tomato and jalapeno omelette just
something really light and healthy after
a workout and I kind of got the same
thing except she is having egg whites
instead of regular eggs and she got
pineapple instead of honeydew but I
really love honeydew off my favorite
food right now so this is what a typical
breakfast looks like for me you should
have some sort of eggs and fruit so that
concludes my workout routine like how I
say fit on vacation video with what I
ate for breakfast this morning so like
how I say healthy how I say for the
vacation I also did a full video of full
