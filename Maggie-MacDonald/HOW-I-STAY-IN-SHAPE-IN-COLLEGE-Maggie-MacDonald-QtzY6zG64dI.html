it's just this white Apple watch sport
with a white or we just said that anyway
hey guys welcome back to my channel in
today's video day three of my 30 day
challenge I am going to be sharing with
you guys the much anticipated workout
routine so this workout is the workout
that I actually did today right before I
started filming this I just got back
from the gym that is why obviously I
look like this and I am just going to be
going through everything that I did and
explaining it to you guys and yeah I
just wanted to share some information
before I got started with the video I've
gotten a lot of questions on yesterday's
video about topics that I just wanted to
discuss before I get into the actual
workout I made a note on my phone
because these were frequently asked
questions on the video and in my inbox
on tumblr and also my DMS on Instagram
so I just wanted to go over how many
times that I work out in a week
typically I work out five times a week I
used to work out six days a week I don't
think I'm gonna be doing it that crazy
this year but four to five times a week
is perfectly fine for me that's what
works out fast and that is what I'm
going to be doing now that I'm settled
in into routine I'm going to start
working out at least five days a week
the other question that I got was how do
I make time to workout and this one I
kind of wanted to explain a little bit
for my own personal opinion when I've
got started with my fitness routine I
struggled to be able to find time to
workout I used to make excuses all the
time I feel like oh well I have homework
that I could be doing or I have this I
have that and I just came to a
realization that honestly if I put the
gym clothes on and I went to the gym I
was gonna get it done plain and simple
that is what helped me another thing
that helped me get into the routine of
working out every single day and making
time to workout was that I made sure
that I worked out 21 days in a row this
was back in my senior year of high
school like right when I started getting
into working out I worked out for 21
days and my mom had always told me that
if you do something for 21 days it will
be
have it so what I did is I worked out
for 21 days and then it became a habit
it became something that was secondhand
to me working out is something that I
don't look at as a chore I don't look at
it as something that I have to do just
because I want to look a certain way or
I want to feel a certain way or
everybody else is working out it's part
of my life it's part of my daily routine
and I just always make time for it I
know that if I put on my workout clothes
and I go to the gym that I am going to
get it done then another question that I
frequently got asked was if I have any
pre-workout snacks or post-workout
snacks and usually I don't eat before I
go to the gym because sometimes we go in
the afternoon and I just had lunch but
if I do I'll just have a little bar or
something or I'll have a plain Greek
yogurt pad this plain Greek yogurt from
Trader Joe's with a little tablespoon of
unsalted crunchy peanut butter in it
lean Greek yogurt is so good for you as
you can see on the nutrition label on
the back it is only 80 calories and it
has 15 grams of protein I like to have
the plain Greek yogurt versus the ones
that are already sweetened for you
because it's a lot better for you I know
what's going in it I know that there are
no additives and stuff like that so I
just opted for that one instead of
having one of the pre sweetened ones if
you don't like the taste of plain Greek
yogurt that's totally fine you can
definitely sweeten it yourself put a
little bit of cinnamon honey anything
like that and it will sweeten it for you
I just wanted to lastly go over some of
my gym essentials I use my Apple watch
sport right here it just has a white
band I use this every single time I
workout I swear by my Apple watch I love
it it's the best thing that I have ever
bought I highly recommend that if you
like working out and you are really into
fitness and things like that that you go
out and invest in an Apple watch the
next thing that I use when I workout are
just my wireless beats and I like to
wear these because I can connect my
phone right to them and not have to
worry about like the long string thing
hanging off from the regular headphones
that connect to
my iPhone and I just feel like there are
a lot more practical especially like
when I'm on the treadmill and doing
workouts where I'm like really running
around and like doing something that's
very high intensity I just wanted to
touch upon those things before I got
into the actual workout that I did today
if you guys have any questions please
leave them in the comments down below
I love reading your comments I love
responding to them and honestly like
makes my heart warm when I see that you
guys are taking my advice and it really
means something to me going on Instagram
and getting messages from you that say
oh I tried out your workout today and it
was great I sweat so much I got one of
those today and it really really really
made me so happy so yeah without further
ado let's get started with the workout
that I did today so before any workout I
always like to start off with a good
stretch it's so important to stretch out
your muscles before you workout so that
is just what I am doing now
then I am going to start up my Apple
watch on the indoor run mode and I am
going to hop on the treadmill and start
doing a hit workout and a hit workout is
a high-intensity interval training and
before I do that I am going to walk on
an incline for about five minutes just
to warm up my muscles before I start
sprinting then going into the sprinting
workout as you can see I'm spending
really fast right now
um I am running at the speed 11 and
there is no incline but I'm going to do
this for 30 seconds straight and then
I'm going to take a break for 30 seconds
and then repeat this for about 10 to 15
minutes
after I'm done I'm just gonna grab a map
and head on over and start my ab workout
right now I am going to be doing single
leg heel taps I am doing 30 reps of
these and four sets and these are side
dips I'm going to be doing 12 on each
side of these and this video is sped up
I'm not actually going this fast in real
life I just had to make it short or else
this video would have been so long but
I'm going to do this 12 times on each
side and then I'm going to do 25 leg
raises and I just try to keep my core
really engaged while I do these and
really focus on working my abs and
breathe in and then I'm going to be
doing opposite arm to leg Superman's and
I do 12 on each side and then after that
I'm going to do single leg toe touches
I'm going to take my opposite arm and
touch my opposite legs and I'm going to
do that 12 times on each side
and now I just wanted to show you again
a close-up of everything that I'm doing
I did repeat all of these exercises four
times in a row
that concludes the workout that I did
today I hope you guys enjoyed this video
please give it a thumbs up if you like
to see my actual routine I will
definitely be making more of these in
the future again leave all of your
questions and comments down below I love
to read them I will read all of them and
be responding to all of those thank you
so so much for watching this video and I
will see you all tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
