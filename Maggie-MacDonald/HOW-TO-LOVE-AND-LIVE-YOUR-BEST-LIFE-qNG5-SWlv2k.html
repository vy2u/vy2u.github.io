today's video I just thought was
something really important that I just
wanted to share with you and if you have
been watching my vlogs for a while you
will know that one of my favorite things
in the whole world is like I love my
life and like living my best life things
like that and that is just something
that I'm really passionate about like I
have learned and grown to love my life
and try to like live the best life that
I possibly can and this saying I love my
life is actually something that I made
up in high school like I just would
always say with my friends I would
always pick oh my god I love my life and
believe it or not people in my high
school actually made fun of me for
saying that and I used to always think
oh my god I love my life and all my
friends would just be like haha Maggie
loves your life like of course but it
was like this big joke and people used
to actually make fun of you for it and
even now I just thought that this video
was important to make because a year ago
today is actually the first day that I
ever posted a video on YouTube I finally
built up the courage I was like you know
what this is something that I've wanted
to do for so long and it's one of my
dreams and this is my life and I only
have one life to live why would I listen
to what all these other people say and
what all these other people think and
care about like if people are gonna make
fun of me because believe it or not they
did make fun of me and I posted my first
video I've my first vlog from Marcus's
birthday it's super weird you can go
check it out it's still on my channel
but the point of this is that yes people
did make fun of me people from my high
school made fun of me people from my
college made fun of me like a lot of
people gave me for it and just to
look back at it now like I remember in
the moment thinking and being like oh my
god like why are these people doing this
like this is so pointless this is my
life this is what I'm doing like they
don't like my videos they don't have to
watch my videos I don't make them follow
me on Instagram
and so I posted my first vlog I heard
from all these people that they were
making fun of it and what I did was I
went on Instagram and I unfollowed all
of them because I didn't care about like
the pettiness of oh they're gonna
unfollow me back and what if I see them
again no I don't care what they think of
me I don't care about their lives like
if you're gonna make fun of me and be
negative but I don't need that
to look back at a year ago from today
and just look at how much my life has
changed since then and the relationships
that I have built now from YouTube and
the opportunities that I've had and if
you guys didn't know I am actually on
the trending page today and I am named
the creator on the rise which I got that
email when I was in class and I freaked
out I was just like oh my god like this
is so awesome because this is a dream of
mine that I've always had and I just
could not be more thankful and I'm so
glad that I never let what other people
think of me get in the way so that comes
to the point of this whole entire video
together I just wanted to give you guys
a message because I get so many comments
like how do you love your life so much
and how are you so positive and so happy
and the number one tip I could sit here
all day and be like you can wake up in
the morning and tell yourself you're
gonna have a good day you can do this
you can do this I can name off a million
different things on how to be happy and
how to live your life like I can write a
book on it but my number one trick to
how to live your best life and how to
love your life and get the most out of
it is to stop caring about what people
think of you and it seems so hard in the
moment you're just like uh it's
difficult to trust me I've been there
I've lived through it a lot of people
give me like they still do you
really just need to stop and think and
look at the bigger picture because this
is your life and you are put on this
earth once so just live your life the
way that you want to live it if you have
a dream go out there and do it I was in
a soul cycle class in California and the
instructor was like you can do anything
you want in life you can face any
obstacle if you have a dream you can
definitely sure as hell I can even vouch
for that like if you have a dream you
can go out there and you can do it year
ago from today if I were to think that I
would have almost 50,000 subscribers on
YouTube and 30,000 followers on
Instagram and be the creator on the rise
after posting my first vlog and getting
 from all these people like no I
would never ever ever have thought that
but it's just because I didn't care what
people thought I never gave up and you
can do that too because the only person
in your life that's gonna be holding you
back and the only person that will make
it difficult for you to pursue
your dreams and accomplish your goals is
yourself so it's you versus yourself you
can wake up in the morning and ask
yourself like am I gonna do what I
actually want in life or am I just gonna
wake up every single day and just do
things because that's the way that other
people are doing it and like that's what
people are used to and that's the norm
no that's not the way that life has to
go like you have complete control over
your life and the way that you feel and
everything like that so I just think
that's my biggest piece of advice that I
could ever ever ever give is to just not
care what people think so yeah that's my
branch of you guys I just wanted to sit
down and do the city really quickly for
you guys and I know that you guys are
all capable of doing amazing things in
the world and don't hold yourself back I
promise you go out there do what you
want doing you love and it will work out
in the end because the only way that you
would not be able to achieve a goal is
if you didn't try so I hope that you
guys enjoyed this video and like comment
subscribe leave all of your like
comments down below I love reading them
I love connecting with you guys I'm so
thankful I just wanted to say thank you
for all of your love and support you've
given me and like with my youtube career
I could not be more thankful I like want
to cry because it makes me so happy that
I am pursuing my dream and and I have
this whole amazing community backing me
up you guys are so awesome and you guys
are honestly the best like I am so happy
with my life right now and I think that
you guys are all capable of feeling the
same exact way so just go out there
don't care what people think
do you want love what you do and I hope
that you guys have an amazing day or
night depending on when you watch this
