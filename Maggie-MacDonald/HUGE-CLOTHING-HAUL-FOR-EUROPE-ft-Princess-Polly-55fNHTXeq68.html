you're new here my name is Maggie and in
today's video I am going to be doing
another haul I have a huge clothing haul
from princess Paul you guys know that
I'm absolutely obsessed with princess
Polly and they are an Australian
online boutique they have literally the
cutest clothes ever like the cutest
dresses skirts they're so trendy and
they're also really affordable
and I'm actually gonna be traveling to
Europe this summer so I was like I need
clothes to wear there because over there
you guys know how trendy it is and just
like the aesthetic is always on point so
I knew that I needed to bring over a ton
of cute clothes and I was like you know
what princess Polly it's gonna have the
cutest things so I've got a ton of stuff
and I'm so excited to share it all with
you guys and you can also use my code
love Maggie for 20% off their whole
entire website I'll have all of their
items linked down below like I always do
and without further ado what let's get
started
the first top I'm gonna show you is
actually really cool I've seen these a
lot lately on Instagram and it reminds
me of my favorite blogger Steve on Ayla
and it's just this scarf right here that
you can wear as a top you can see in the
child part it's just really really silky
and has a cool pattern I don't know I
just thought that this was so different
in definitely Europe vibes and then I
just picked up a pair of shorts and
there are these plain cream shorts and
they're kind of high-waisted and they're
just like flowy and comfy and super cute
to wear with like a nice top like a tank
top and some sandals and dress it up
with some jewelry and stuff I love
wearing shorts like this during the
summer I don't really like wearing denim
shorts just because they don't fit me
that well so whenever I can get my hands
on a pair of high-waisted comfy shorts I
have to get them and like I was saying
before princess Holly has the best
skirts ever so I just got this black
skirt right here and I got this in a
size medium and also in the shorts that
I just showed you I got those in a size
8 so I'll be seeing the sizes whenever I
show you guys what I got and you can
obviously see in the Tryon what it looks
like but personally on me like my size
varies from princess Holly because it is
Australian so the sizing is different so
I think an 8 is a u.s. small and then
sometimes they'll have like mediums like
so medium large on the website I'm
pretty sure but this skirt right here
that I got is is in a size medium and
it's just this black high-waisted really
flowy skirt with a drawstring waist that
I really like and then it also has this
ruffle detailing on the bottom I think
this is so cute to wear with like a pair
of espadrilles and a tank top I know I'm
gonna be getting a ton of use out of
this I honestly might wear it this
Friday I'm going out to dinner with
Tyler and his family so I think that
this is super cute just something that's
like really simple and comfortable but
also it can it just have any outfit and
then I got two pairs of pants and the
first pair is this pair of Tan
high-waisted ones and it kind of has on
like a pleated detailing in the front
and then it is just belted at the waist
and then they go all the way down in our
straight leg I got these in a size
Australian 10
so a medium and I think that they're
super cute I really want to wear them
with like this black tank top that I got
that all shouldn't be showing you guys
but I think this alpha would be so cute
with like a pair of nude heels like a
little strap around the ankle just
something so like plain and simple and
classy but also very dressed up in
casual I don't know I really really
liked that and I thought that they were
different I didn't own anything like
this in my closet and then I also got
another pair of pants and there are
these high-waisted paper bag pants with
the drawstring and they are really loose
and flowy and then go down and they're
flared on the edge but I got these pants
in a size 10 I think they're super cute
I'm gonna be going to Aruba in a few
weeks so I think that these are so
beachy and like casual too and I think I
want to wear it with like a banjo top
and some layered gold necklaces I just
think that these are really really cute
I really like pants personally like I
was saying before I don't like writing
jean shorts anything like that so I
always like to be like comfy and casual
and cute so I think that these pants
will be absolutely perfect for that and
the next thing I picked up is this black
tank top that I was telling you guys
about before as you can see it is kind
of ribbed and has a lettuce edge
detailing on the bottom and it's just
spaghetti strap or not like spaghetti
top a little bit thicker than that and
it's really stretchy the material is
which I really liked like as you can see
there has a lot of stretch to it and I
got this in a size 8 and this thing
jumps so cute everybody needs a plain
black tank top but this one's kind of
more dressed up because of the material
and I'm gonna end up wearing it with
those tan pants that I showed you I just
think that that would look super cute
this change up really like hugs you in
the right place and is super flattering
and I got another tank top from princess
Polly it's just this white one with a
little tie in the front and I got this
in a size 8 and if you guys follow me on
Instagram you would have seen when I
went to Miami
the last time I had a tank top that was
exactly the same as this but it was like
a baby blue color and I'll insert a
picture like right here of what it
looked like you guys really really liked
that so I was like you know what I'm
gonna get it in a different color I know
I'm gonna be getting a ton of use out of
it I think it's so cute and I love the
little tight detailing on the front I
just think that it adds a super nice
touch and then I got
this tan top and I got this in the size
eight it's just an off-the-shoulder
i'm little blousy top with a tie in the
front and i know that this has been a
trend lately a lot of people have been
wearing like tops with little ties in
the front like the one I'm wearing right
now and I just think that they're so
cute and this one's different because
it's off the shoulder normally I don't
like to wear off the shoulder items I
just feel like they don't look like good
on me with like the shoulders that I
have I don't know but I think that this
is so cute I can definitely find a cool
way to style this and it'll be perfect
for Europe and then I also got another
tie top this one is in a size 8 it's
this blush-colored little cropped blouse
with this ruffle detailing on the sleeve
I love shirts like this I own one of
these in black from Princess Holly and I
loved it so much I was like you know
what I should get a different color but
a color that I don't normally wear and I
think that this color is so cute and
neutral and I like I said before don't
wear a lot of color but I think like a
blush pink like nude rosy color like
this is so flattering and would look
good on like any skin tone like
especially if you have a nice tan like
it's summertime and you're like glowing
radiant I just think that this color
would look so good and princess Polly
has the cutest sets ever so I was like
you know what I have to pick up a set
from for instance folly of course I just
got this one right here that has these
shorts and they have these little
buttons up the front and I got this in a
size 8 so those are the bottoms and this
is what the top looks like it's just a
tank top with again the same little
buttons and a zip up the back and it's a
really lightweight material and it's
kind of like almost silky it's really
really soft and this is so cute to wear
I would like a pair of gladiator sandals
and gold jewelry I think that it is so
like comfortable and casual but also
really really cute and dressy like you
would look at someone wearing this and
be like oh my god they look so cute and
like dressed up but low-key this is like
Wiki comfortable and needed like no
effort at all to wear it so that's my
favorite when you can look effortlessly
cute but also be super comfortable and
princess Polly is known for having the
cutest dresses ever so I had to pick
so many dresses and the first one is
this gingham dress right here I got this
in a size 8 and it's long-sleeved and
just wraps around the front and has a
little tie you can tie it on the back or
even like on the side wherever you want
and normally I didn't like like the
whole King I'm trying to know it's been
a trend for a while and I didn't like it
until recently I was like you know what
I don't think I would ever wear that I'm
gonna look like a picnic table but and
then I saw like the black Ingham
addresses on princess Polly and Sammy
Robinson always wears Princess funny and
I love her vlogs and she had a gingham
dress from Prince's folly so of course I
had to getting him dressed and princes
folly but this one's super cute it kind
of goes really low in the front so I
definitely would have sized up in this
dress just because of the wrap detailing
you can title a lot tighter even if you
go up in a size so if you want to get
the stress I definitely recommend sizing
up in it the next dress I got is my
absolute favorite I love this pattern
and I think I'm going to be ordering a
romper in this as well and it is this
red floral dress again with the same
wrap detailing and the sleeves are so
cute on this one they're just ruffled
and they have like an elastic around the
side and I got this in a size 8 and I
again this wrap dress I definitely could
have gone up in the size and gotten a
size 10 just because it goes a lot like
lower than normal and I just feel like
it shows a lot like I would rather have
had it been like more conservative so I
wished I sized up in this way I think
it's super cute so it has the same tidy
telling again that you can tie in the
back or on the side so I really really
like this and I think that the pattern
is so cute and it's a nice lightweight
dress for summer and the next dress that
I got I've been dying to get for the
longest time ever in my last princess
Holly haul I was talking about how I
like wanted this just so bad but it was
sold out
and this is it right here and it looks
like the Selena Gomez dress that she
wore I don't know like what event she
went to but it was like red it was
really tight on the top and then it just
flared out really nicely and it was
super flattering so I got in black and
it looks really similar to that just has
these spaghetti straps and then is
playing all around I got this
the size 10 and it fits so well it's so
flattering I can't wait to go to an
event where I can wear this dress like a
nice dinner or something I'm so excited
I just think that this is literally the
perfect little black dress and then I
got another really casual romper and
this one is just cream-colored and it
has the little button detailing down the
front I noticed that that has been a
trend recently like buttons down the
front of either like a shirt or a dress
or romper I think it's really cute right
now and this one has a little tie around
the waist and some little pockets and I
got this in a size 10 and I love rompers
just because they're so easy to throw on
and let go about your day and you don't
really have to put any effort into the
outfit just like dress it up with a
little bit of jewelry some cute shoes
and like you're good to go
and I got another gingham dress this one
is so cute it has a tie on the front and
then a little ruffle detailing with the
same button look down the front and this
one's cute because it's tight at the top
and then kind of flares out at the
bottom and how adjustable straps which I
liked because if it didn't have that I
think it would have been like weird in
the front with the tie so it's nice that
it has the adjustable straps and also
this like elastic detailing on the back
since it is tied at the top and loose at
the bottom and this one I got in a size
8 it's so cute I can't wait to wear this
in Europe with a pair of sneakers like a
little backpack or something like cute
sunglasses oh you guys are gonna know
like when I'm posting all my pictures
you're gonna see all of these outfits
and be like oh my god princess Polly
like I need to buy everything from there
they're so amazing like I love them so
much how cute is this dress okay
the next dress I'm gonna show you guys
again is gingham I know I am have
obsession right now with gingham but
this one is cute because it's plain all
throughout and it just has a little
zipper up the back and it has the same
tight detailing as the one that I just
showed you but it doesn't have like the
buttons or like the little hole in the
front or the ruffles this one is just
really really plain I think that it's so
cute just a little shift dress with the
little adjustable straps and spaghetti
straps right here I love little dresses
like this just because you can wear a
pair of sneakers with them and like cute
little accessories like a little
backpacker so
thing and I don't know I just like love
the look of that so simple and cute and
I got this dress in a size 8 as well and
this next dress that I got is just plain
black and it has little spaghetti straps
and they are adjustable as well I got
into size 8 and it just has this little
like detailing across the front it's
like a piece of extra fabric that ties
over and then ties on the side to give
it like some extra like a extra little
mm like I don't know how to really
describe it but I think it's so cute it
has ruffles on the bottom and it's just
really flattering with the piece that
ties over I just think that and like as
a nice touch to a plain black dress and
just like the dress I showed you before
this I bought this other black dress and
it's exactly the same except it doesn't
have the ruffle on the bottom and I know
you're probably like Maggie why did you
get like a dress that looked exactly the
same one with a ruffle one without
ruffle like you never know how you're
feeling if you like the ruffle gives off
like a different vibe then the dress
with no ruffle but I got this one in the
size 8 as well and I have a white um I
not eyelet it's kind of like Oh Swiss
dot
it's a white Swiss dot dress from
princess Polly that's exactly the same
as this and I wore in Miami I'll insert
the snapchat picture right here and I
just thought that looks so cute and I
was obsessed with the style of it so I
have to get it in black of course and I
know that I'm going to be getting a ton
of use out of this just a plain a black
dress I think is perfect for any
occasion okay few more things I know
this haul is gonna be super long but I
have three things left three things and
the first is this romper right here so
cute guys like I am so obsessed with
this I got this in a size 10 and it's
just striped and has this little tie in
the front and then this silver zipper
that goes all the way down the back
which i think is such a cool detail and
it also has pockets which I love having
pockets on a robber is the best ever
like I think that if you don't have
pockets I don't know I just feel like
sometimes it feels like bunchy but with
pockets it just like makes it feel
better and it is strapless and it what
is nice of
is that it has the little like rubber
thing around the edge so it doesn't
slide down on you I know with me like
whenever I wear strapless stuff like if
it doesn't have that then I always I'm
constantly pulling it up but I think
that this is so cute I want to wear it
with a pair of like cork heels I just
think that that would look so nice and
like a straw clutch I think it's so cute
I cannot wait to wear it and I got it a
size 10 if I think I just said that
before but I feel like I've showed you
so many things I've been saying the
sizes of all them so that it's kind of
hard to keep up with them and I've been
talking for almost 20 minutes huh this
next romper I've been dying to get for
the longest time it's this white fellow
II sleeved romper with like this ruffle
detailing on the bottom which kind of
makes it look like a dress but it is a
romper and it has a tie on the back
which I absolutely love just because I
like to tie I look really tight just
like kind of sucks you in like makes it
a lot more flattering but this romper is
so cute it has this like detailing in
the fabric as you can see it kind of has
like little squares and I love the flowy
sleeves I love the Floyd bottom with
like the tight waist I think that this
is so cute to dress up with like a pair
of heels and some jewelry I just think
that it's very very classy and would
look good for any occasion you can wear
it out to lunch you could wear it out to
dinner and it is the perfect - summer
romper and then I got another one of the
dresses with the piece of fabric that
like ties across the front I don't know
what to call this if you guys know like
how I could describe this other than a
dress with a piece of fabric that ties
let me know in the comments because I'm
like so confused right now
but this is that it's just this plain
white dress with that same fabric across
the front and then ruffle detailing on
the bottom and this one is short-sleeved
and it's kind of sheer the material so I
do recommend like wearing something
underneath just so it's not see-through
I got this one in a size 8 it's super
cute I cannot wait to wear it this
summer I am absolutely obsessed with it
I love this style like you guys know I
got like three dresses in the same style
we're like different variations so this
one is super super super cute if you're
looking for a nice dress to wear like
out to lunch like during the day
definitely get this one okay and the
last item that I got I totally
not that I even got this because I'm
wearing it on my body right now but it's
just this plain white blouse and it has
this like cute tight detailing in the
front is cropped you guys will see in
the Tryon part but I got this I think in
the size 8 I can't check right now
because on my body but I'm pretty sure I
got in a size 8 I got a lot of my tops
in a size 8 I think it's so cute you can
wear it with a skirt wear with jeans
Hiram's shorts literally anything I love
like the little cropped blouse trend
this spring with like the little ties I
think that it's so flattering and
they're so cute especially for like a
body type like mine I have no boobs at
all
so these tops are like super easy to
wear with anything I don't even have to
wear a bra with them they're so
comfortable and so cute and I love love
love love this top I don't know I just
feel like it's like super cute I haven't
