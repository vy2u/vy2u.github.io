today's video I just have a Vega
collective haul for you from Urban
Outfitters and free people and also
brandy melville so I just recently
picked up all of these things for fall
and I'm so happy that I got them all I
think that they're super cute and I
cannot wait to share them with you and I
will have all of these items linked down
below in the description box if you guys
want to buy them or anything like that
so I will have all of them down there
for you let's just get on into the video
and I hope you guys enjoyed this haul
and yeah so let's get started so one of
the first items that I actually got from
brandy melville that I've been loving
recently is just this yellow cropped
t-shirt and it's so cute on it's one of
my favorite shirts right now and I love
just the way that it looks when you're
wearing boyfriend jeans it's really not
that tight and fitted to your body so
it's kind of loose if you know what I
mean like on the stomach area so I love
this right now I really don't think it
was that expensive I think around like
16 dollars and it is one size brandy
melville usually is one size fits all so
yes this t-shirt is one size the next
item that I got from brandy melville is
just this denim skirt right here and
this is one size as well but I swear
that it's a medium yeah it is a medium
so it says one size on the tag but it is
a medium and it's just this denim skirt
with kind of the Freid detailing on the
ends and this skirt is high-waisted
which I love I love all high waisted
things I just love how it really sucks
you in and like makes you look you can
wear crop tops with it so that's like my
thing right now
high-waisted with a crop top and this
skirt was only $32 it was a lot less
expensive than the one that I'm gonna be
showing you that I got from Urban
Outfitters a few weeks ago but yeah so I
got this and the next item that I got
from brandy melville if you saw my vlog
from the weekend last week I showed you
guys this really quickly just like when
I was in the car after I left the mall
but it's just this red bodycon dress
with this white stripe down the middle
and it is a spaghetti strap and this
dress is again one size and it was $32
so I
love this and they can't wait to wear it
with like a pair of sneakers and gold
jewelry and some fun sunglasses on like
a warm day maybe with a jean jacket
because for fought like this has been a
really warm fall here in Massachusetts
so I just I'm so excited to wear this I
think that you can still go into October
wearing dresses which I love so I cannot
wait to wear this dress and the last
thing that I got from brandy melville is
just this cropped tank top right here in
the spaghetti strap and it just ties in
the back completely so it kind of like
has a bow in the back if you know what
I'm talking about but yes it just looks
like this this again is one size and I
don't know how much this was I don't
have the tag on it anymore but I will
have it linked down below I'm sure it's
still probably around like the 20 to 30
dollar range which usually is what most
Frannie Melville items are next I just
got a few things from Free People and I
got this
cropped long-sleeve shirt right here and
it's from their Free People intimate are
we I think it's the Free People intimate
no Free People movement and I got this
in a size extra small and it just has
this little knot on the front and then
it has kind of like an elastic band on
the back since it is from their workout
line but I just think that this is gonna
be so cute with a pair of high waisted
leggings and like a bomber jacket just
to like run around and wear while I do
errands or something like that so I'm so
excited about this the next item that I
got from Free People if you guys again
saw my blogs I got so many questions on
where I got this jacket and it's my new
favorite jacket ever for the Fall and
it's just this green bomber jacket and
the inside guys oh my god it's literally
amazing if you can see it it's kind of
like a soft really really soft
sweatshirt material and I got this also
in a size extra small but it's kind of
like a greenish gray color and it's
quilted and I love this jacket so much
oh my god it's my favorite jacket ever I
don't know what I would do without it I
really think that I don't I wouldn't be
able to survive the fall without it it's
honestly that amazing I love it love it
love it and I'm gonna try to find the
link and have it down below because if
you are looking for a good bomber jacket
for the Fall this one right here next
just going in
some items that I got from Urban
Outfitters this one I recently picked up
I think a few weeks ago it's been in a
few my videos it's one of my favorite
items right now and it's just this denim
miniskirt right here with the frayed
edges like that and I love this skirt so
much it does run big I got it in a size
extra small so definitely try this on
before ordering it because usually I
would never think that I have an extra
smallest skirt but this one did run
really big so I got this and then extra
small next I got another skirt from
Urban Outfitters
this one was $54 and it's just this red
skirt with this elastic band right here
and then the size are so cool look
they're literally like button-down they
kind of remind you those pants you wear
when you can literally rip them off your
body but these this skirt is so cool and
I cannot wait to wear it with like a
white tube top and a pair of my DITA
sneakers so I'm so happy I got this I
was looking for it literally for the
longest time and I ordered it online it
just came in so I haven't been able to
wear it yet but I am so so so excited to
wear it next from Urban Outfitters I
just got this silence and noise
long-sleeve top kind of looks like this
and it's a little bit cropped on the
edges and then aren't not on the edges
on the bottom it's cropped on the bottom
and then this is kind of roached the
sleeves are and it's just like this
really really awesome bright orange
color and I really like it a lot this is
any size extra small oh this shirt was
actually on sale it was $24.99 so I got
this shirt on sale and I'm so happy that
I found this and honestly fits so well I
think it's gonna look great with a pair
of boyfriend jeans and a pair of
sneakers or pair of sandals for the fall
I just love this color right now and
yeah so I cannot wait to wear this the
next thing that I got from Urban
Outfitters is just this short sleeve top
right here with these really flowy
sleeves oh wait actually that's upside
down sorry so it's just this crop top
right here and it ties in the front and
then just has like these really flowy
sleeves this one I got in a size small
and it's the kimchi blue brand and this
was $34 I'm so excited to wear these
with boyfriend jeans I think that this
top is gonna be so cute for the Fall
if you like everything that I got I'm
literally just like oh my god it's gonna
be so cute for the fall but I get so
asked so many questions on tumblr about
like what to wear what outfits to wear
for certain events and most of the
things that I got are actually things
that I linked on tumblr when people ask
me like for recommendations on what they
should actually wear so this is one of
my favorites right now and I highly
recommend that you also go get it it's
super cute on next I got this white
romper from urban and I got it in a size
small it was oh it was on sale for $40
and it just looks like this in the front
and kind of like Criss crosses a little
bit and then has this really really cute
tie and then in the back it's just kind
of low in spaghetti strap but I think
that this will look so good with like a
tan and I just got these really cute
cork sandals if you saw my last vlog
where I kind of just showed you
everything I got when I was in the car I
got these really cute Chinese Laundry
cork heel old sandal things and I'm
gonna wear it with this romper and I'm
so excited for some cool jewelry so I
think that this is super cute and just a
throne with like a light jacket and go
out to dinner or something like that or
go out to lunch
I think it's the perfect outfit for a
fall day and it's not white completely
it's kind of like an off-white cream
color so yeah I just I'm so excited to
wear this oh my god next this is my
favorite thing that I got from this
whole entire haul this item is literally
by far my favorite I was in the dressing
room trying on all the stuff that I got
and I saw this skirt and obviously I
think someone must have like tried it on
and it didn't work out or didn't fit
them so when they gave it to the person
like standing outside the fitting rooms
and I was looking through all those
clothes there you guys oh my god I'm so
obsessed with this skirt I can always
wear it I love it I got it any size
extra small and it was $30 oh my god
wait does this say it's reversible oh no
it's not but guys the skirt like gives
me life this adidas black skirt it's
really plain and it just has like an
elastic waist oh my god I can't wait to
wear it I'm so excited
but I think I'm gonna wear it with a
crop sweatshirt and a pair of Adidas
sneakers like my gazelles or something
but I'm so happy that I got this the
girl was like you that looks so good on
you you need to get it it's the last one
so I was like you know what I'm gonna
get it it was only $30 I really really
really liked it I've really been into
like skirts and kind of just like the
chill vibe right now and like Urban
Outfitters Free People
brandy melville like all those brands
are just like really my style cuz I get
asked a lot of times on tumblr like
which stores are my favorite and these
have to be my favorite right now I just
love the vibe that they give if you guys
know what I mean and lastly from urban I
got this tank top that I'm wearing but
it's just this little ribbed tank top
and yeah it just has a little like grey
band on it and it just has these really
really dainty thin straps in the back so
I love love love this chain top I just
think that it would be so cute with like
a pair of joggers or leggings like I'm
wearing right now just really chill like
good vibes comfortable that's like my
go-to I love being comfortable don't get
me wrong I like being cute too but when
you can look cute and be comfortable at
the same time that's my thing okay and
for the last item that I got this one is
my favorite I've been looking for
something like this for the longest time
and honestly I'm so happy with my
purchase it was kind of on the more
expensive side I know that this brand is
really really really nice and so that
item that I got is my favorite new
leather jacket you guys if you follow me
an incertum you'll see that I posted a
picture wearing this when I was out to
brunch and it's just this black studded
blank NYC leather jacket it's my
absolute favorite for the Fall I got it
in a size small and I will try to have
the exact one that I got linked down
below for you but yeah I love this
jacket I love leather jackets in the
fall and like suede jackets moto jackets
bomber jackets you name it those are all
my favorites so I'm so happy I found
this one because last year I had about a
leather jacket that had gold detailing
on it and then I've been seeing a lot of
them around
like silver buckles and silver studs and
I just like really wasn't into the gold
and silver on the jacket I kind of just
wanted something neutral and plain so
when I saw this when I was like oh my
god yes that's the winner I love that
jacket I'm gonna wear it all the time so
I'm so happy that it got it and that
