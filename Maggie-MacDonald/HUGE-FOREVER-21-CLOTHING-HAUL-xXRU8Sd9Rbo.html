today's video as you can see by the
title I have a huge haul for you from
forever 21 and if you watch my vlogs you
will know that I am obsessed with
forever 21 I've been absolutely loving
everything from there lately
and what I've recently noticed with
forever 21 is that they're taking trends
and cute items from other higher-end
clothing stores like Urban Outfitters
and so many different ones and they are
making the exact dupes and selling it
for such a more affordable price so I've
been loving forever 21 lately I recently
just got a ton of stuff you guys are
gonna be so excited all these pieces are
so cute and I'm gonna get started with
the video because I have so much to show
you but again like always I will have
all these items linked down below for
you if you guys want to check them out
and buy them whatever so without further
ado let's get started
so I'm gonna start off with the basics
that I got you guys know that I love
basics I am the most like plain and
simple person when it comes to my style
I revolve my whole entire like vibe
around basics just being comfortable but
still looking cute so these pieces that
I picked up are definitely samples in my
closet I think everybody needs them
they're so affordable I got two body
suits and this is actually the second
time about to get this body suit because
I loved it so much in Keighley actually
stole it from me because she loved it
too and was obsessed with it so it's
just this seamless black regular tank
top bodysuit it kind of has like a low
scoop in the back and I picked this
bodysuit up in a size extra small small
it comes in two different sizes extra
small small and the medium large and I
got the extra small small and it is
seamless and stretchy so it definitely
fits really really well and I also
picked it up in white just because it's
so timeless and definitely a great basic
to have so it's only eight dollars I was
like you know what I'm gonna get two of
them black and white it'll be perfect to
wear like with high we sit boy friend
jeans or shorts whatever and I'm so so
so excited you guys this is the best
bodysuit ever in the whole entire world
you need it the next two basics that I
got our another one of their seamless
items and they're just these little
cropped straight across
camis these were like five bucks
I wear these all the time with high
waisted leggings I just got them in the
mail literally like three days ago and
I've worn them so much so I got this
black one and then I also picked it up
in white as well so it's the same thing
just straight across it has adjustable
straps on the back and I picked these up
in a size medium large just like the
other seamless body suits I got these
came in extra small small medium large
and I got these in medium large just
because the extra small/small was sold
out I was like you know what it's
seamless they're stretchy they
definitely will fit and these honestly
fits will look better than the extra
small/small would because I feel like
those would fit more like a bralette and
these fit more as like a candy top and
again they were so affordable and
they're one of those things that you can
wear all the time and they'll go with
everything and then if you need to
replace it because they're like getting
worn out you can easily just buy them
because they are so cheap and then I
just picked up this little white bikini
top and it has this little cute knot in
the front and I don't know I saw this on
the website I was like you know what
that's so cute I have white bottoms
already and I could just interchange it
with the top that I have now and wear it
like for spring break or whatever so I
just picked this little top up I thought
it was so cute the little knot in the
front is so trendy right now and it was
really affordable so I got this and I
know I got this in a size small and the
next shirt I picked up from forever 21
is just this little cropped white
t-shirt and it says oh baby and red
writing you guys know without red is my
absolute favorite color I used to have a
shirt like this from made well it said
Shou on the front I wore it all the time
but then I wore it so much that I
couldn't wear it anymore and I ended up
getting rid of it but I just got this in
a size small this was so cheap
eight dollars and it's gonna be so cute
with like leggings boyfriend jeans
sneakers
I love graphic tees right now I think
that there's so much fun like with
little sayings on it and they make your
pictures on Instagram looks so cute if
you have like a little graphic tee on I
just think it like adds something a
little bit extra and I love the red
writing so yes I definitely needed this
and I saw and I always say baby I'm like
yeah baby oh baby whatever so I was like
yeah I need that and then I also got
this white cropped tank top and I have
this in black as well and I got it in a
size small $5 $5 for this
and I'm gonna get so much use out of
this I think that this is another great
basic to have in your closet then I also
picked up another bodysuit it's just
this plain of black long sleeve bodysuit
with this detailing on the front it
snaps up I got this in a size small and
I thought that this was super cute just
because it's plain black it's cold here
in Boston it's winter and I needed
something that was gonna be long-sleeve
that would still look super cute like
when I go out and stop so I just thought
that the little snap detailing added
like a nice little touch it it's so
comfortable definitely a really nice
basic to have and going along with the
bodysuit I just showed you I actually
got it to wear specifically with these
pants right here and they are these
black satin joggers with this white
stripe down the front and they are
drawstring super high-waisted I'm
obsessed with these I wore this and the
bought the black bodysuit I just showed
you with a pair of black heels to an
event that I went to over the weekend
when I was at the Super Bowl and it was
such a cute outfit so effortless girls
like the Patriots cheerleaders we're
coming up to me and they were like oh my
god your outfits so cute where did you
get it and I was just like forever 21
like my whole outfits from forever 21
it's so cheap I love it they're so
trendy and they were like shut up and I
was just like yes forever 21 is the best
but you need to shop online from forever
or else like going in the store I feel
like I don't find anything so definitely
if you're looking to get good stuff from
their shop online and so in the next
thing I got is this cropped sweatshirt
it has this black and white stripe
detailing on the bottom and it just
laces up the front and I thought this
was different and fun because usually
when I wear cop sweatshirts they're all
playing they're gray I have that brandy
melville when I took from Emma that's
like dark gray I was like you know what
I need to do something fun I need to get
something cute so I just thought that
this would be really cute with like a
pair of joggers or something or even
like boyfriend jeans just because like
the lace-up detailing is cute and fun
and so are the little stripes on the
bottom and I got this in a size small as
well and then I picked up some pieces
that were a little bit more dressy just
because I was like you know what I can't
wear basic clothes all the time I have
to have some cute items in my closet so
I got this dress that I'm in love with
and I'm gonna be aware it when I go to
Miami and I got it in a size medium it
was $19 how cute is this guys it has a
little kiss marks all over in it go
it was like a lower V and the front it
has these little ruffles and then it
kind of flares out on the bottom like
this it's super cute and it like kind of
ties across and then look at the
detailing in the back it laces up it's
so cute and I'm definitely gonna be
wearing this this weekend and maybe
posting a picture for Valentine's Day
wearing this I just thought that it was
so cute I was like you know what that's
so cute and I really have like seen a
lot of girls wearing like prints like
this like Zevon ela I follow her on
Instagram she's one of my favorite
vloggers she was wearing a dress that
had kiss prints and I was like oh my god
I'm obsessed with that I need it when I
saw it at forever 21 like something like
this where it's only $20 you can get
away with like wearing it once and then
taking a few pictures in it and like
never wearing it again it's one of those
things that like if you buy it to look
cute in a few times it's definitely not
gonna put a dent in your wallet and the
next thing I got was definitely more out
of my comfort zone it is this blue and
white striped skirt and it does tie on
the side and it's super long and like
different length with like a ruffle in
the front and I I don't know I just saw
this and I was like you know what that
would look so cute because like I said
before I am going to Miami soon and so I
thought about wearing this with like
nude heels and I have this white um like
smocked bralette from brandy melville
that I'm gonna wear with that didn't
like some hoops in my hair in the middle
part I don't know I had like this vision
in my head and I was like you know what
I need to get that skirt it was $22 I
got it in a size small I think it's
super cute like especially if you're
going on a vacation and like you can
wear it out to dinner or wear it during
the day I thought that it was so cute
and different and I wanted to like
branch out and try something new so I
picked that up and then I also got this
jumper from forever 21 I will insert the
picture here I wore it over the weekend
and my one of my Instagram pictures and
all of you guys were like where is that
from oh my god I'm so obsessed with it
so it is just that this black jumpsuit
with this little cutout in the front and
then it ties around the back and kind of
has a little open back and then goes
long in the front obviously and has
these really amazing slits in your legs
so when you walk you can literally see
like you're like popping through the
slits I don't know I just thought that
it was super sexy to wear to an event
and I
this in a size medium and it isn't
forever21 it's one of the brands that
they work with but it's called Lux oh
and I got this in a size medium and last
but not least probably one of my most
requested items that I posted on my
Instagram that you guys were going
insane over is in this jacket right here
and it is this puffy silver metallic
jacket and I put a little pin on it from
the Super Bowl it just has like the 52
and then the little logos from both
teams and I wore this to the Super Bowl
over the weekend with a pair of leggings
and that little cropped cami that I
showed you in the beginning of the video
and I got so many questions about where
this jackets from but yes it's from 421
and you will not believe how much it was
literally 15 dollars and I saw this
jacket at forever 21 over the weekend
and I was just like yes I need that I
need to wear to the game it's so fun and
it's one of those things where if it
wasn't 15 dollars I probably would never
spend my money on it just because like I
don't know I would never think to buy
like a silver jacket and like spend more
than that but honestly I'm probably
gonna end up bringing it again it's
super cute and it fit really well and it
was actually warm surprisingly so it
just looks like this and it's plain
silver a little puffy bomber jacket type
thing so that was super cute and that
