today's video I have a huge haul for you
all of the items that I'm gonna be
showing you today are from the website
princess Polly it's my new obsession I
don't know how I didn't know about
princess Polly before this but the
clothes on their site are so cute I'm so
sad that this package didn't come in
before my spring break I would have had
so many cute outfits I am obsessed with
everything that I got so I'm so excited
to share them with you guys I'm not
gonna make this intro super long just
because I have so much to show you and I
want to get on into it and I just want
to quickly thank princess Polly for
sponsoring this video I'm absolutely
obsessed with their brand when they
reach out to me I was so excited about
this video I like couldn't get over it I
was freaking out just because their
clothes are so cute so when they reach
out to me I was like oh my god this is
literally a dream I'm so excited so
again I have all these items linked down
below for you as well as my discount
code for you guys to use you can get 20%
off the whole entire site which is
absolutely amazing without further ado
let's get started so I wanted to keep
this video kind of organized so I'm
gonna start off by showing you some of
the bottoms that I got and the first
pair of bottoms I got are just these
shorts and the brand is girl in the Sun
I got them in a size small and they're
these white linen shorts with this bow
tie in the front these are so cute
they're super high waist say they fit
really really well and they are also are
super lightweight and the next item I
got is another pair of shorts and the
brand is just the princess Polly brand I
got them in a size small they're super
high waisted as well and they kind of
have the paper bag look with another tie
in the front and they have a tiered
ruffled on the side and then they flare
out these ones are so cute they fit so
well they really suck you in they're
super lightweight perfect for summer and
if it's warmer out you can wear them
with a little tank top some gold jewelry
maybe a pair of heels dress them up
dress them down whatever they may be I
know that these are definitely gonna be
a staple in my closet and next I picked
up this striped skirt and the brand is
ava and I got it in the size 8 which I
think converts into a small Australian
size but it's just this brown and white
striped skirt with this ruffle detailing
and a tie on the side it fits so well it
is kind of a stretchy material and it
a zip off the back I really really like
this I usually don't wear skirts but
since this is high-waisted I have to get
it I can't wait to wear it this spring I
think that it's so cute and this trend
is really in right now like the tie
across with a little bow on the side you
just think that it's so flattering in
such a cute look if you're going up to
lunch dinner whatever it may be and then
I picked up a few tops the first one is
this one that I'm actually wearing right
now I want to talk about it before I
forgot it's this light blue tank top and
it has a little tie in the front and I
got this in a size small I believe it is
the princess Polly Brand I will double
check for you guys and it's just this
plain tank top it's cropped you guys
know I love cropped tank tops and I am
obsessed with the color this color is so
flattering it makes you look so tan and
I just really like the way that it fits
it's really form-fitted to your body you
can work with pair of denim shorts you
can wear with skirts anything it really
will go with everything dress up any out
but I think this color is absolutely
amazing you guys have to get this tank
top and the next item I got is just this
little cropped t-shirt from the brand
morning mist I got this in the size 8
and it is kind of crisscross and looped
around the front and it is completely
cropped and short sleeve and I love
cropped shirts you guys know I think
that this is so cute I don't have
anything like this and it is a little
bit ribbed which I liked as well just to
add a little detailing and touch to the
shirt but you can wear something like
this with anything you can work with
boyfriend jeans a denim skirt
high-waisted shorts I just think that
it's such a nice staple to have
especially this spring and I know I'm
gonna be getting a ton of use out of
this shirt I love the style and I
absolutely love the fit okay everybody
stop are you doing right now you need to
go order these two shirts that about to
show you these are my favorite by far
they are by the brand lioness and I got
them in two different colors just
because I knew I was going to be so
obsessed with it the first one is this
periwinkle blue color that I'm wearing
right now my new obsession for the
spring and it is just this shirt that
has a tie in the front and then these
big long ties for straps guys this shirt
is so so so cute I'm obsessed I'm gonna
be wearing it so much this spring I love
this color I just love how Kroft it is
it kind of is like a little bra let and
it really is so girly
but it's also so classy and sexy and I
am obsessed with it I have way too many
good things to say about the shirt so so
so cute definitely got to be one of my
favorite trends for spring 2018 and
since I got the shirt in blue have to
pick it up in black just because black
goes with everything and black just
really looks good with darker hair I
feel and since I have dark brown hair I
thought that I'd pick up the black one I
think it might also come in white but I
picked up this shirt in a size small
super cute you guys need to get it okay
going into rompers and dresses I just
wanted to start off by showing you guys
this romper by the princess Polly brand
it's just this black chiffon material
romper and it has a tie in the front you
can't really see right now you can see
in the Tryon portion but it fits so well
I picked this up in a size 10 I sized up
in this just because I know that rompers
tend to fit me a little bit differently
than dresses and skirts but I think that
this is so cute I can't wait to wear it
with their heels cool jewelry it's gonna
look so good this spring and I think a
black romper is definitely a staple that
everybody should have in their closet
the next romper I want to show you guys
is by lioness and it is this white
romper with this cross tie detailing in
the front I picked this up in a size
medium I love the way that it fits I'm
glad that I sized up in it just because
I have bigger legs and kind of a bigger
butt so I need to always size up and
rompers or else it won't fit me in like
the lower portion of my body but I think
that this is so cute it is so classy and
you can really wear with anything you
can dress it up dress it down super cute
definitely a staple for this spring I
absolutely love it and next I just got
this roughly blue wrap dress by the
brand Ava I picked it up in a size 8 it
is this denim e blueish grey color and I
really like it I think that it's so
flattering I love the ruffle detailing
on it I think that it is so cute and
girly and I noticed that one of the
trends for the spring is items that have
that wrap around and then with a tie on
the edge I don't really know if there's
a name for that but I really am obsessed
with it right now and I thought that
this was super cute and one of my
favorite bloggers Ivonne Ayla actually
was wearing this dress before so I was
like I am obsessed with that I need it
for myself
so you guys should totally get this
dress I think that it's so cute and for
any event that you have in the spring
this is absolutely perfect
and the next dress that I got is this
orange like tangerine II colored dress
by the brand Saints and secrets and I
got it in a size us small which is
Australian eight it has this little tie
in the front and then it kind of flares
out and is roughly at the bottom and it
has spaghetti straps and the straps do
kind of fit a little bit bigger if you
do want to order down a size I would
recommend doing that just so the shops
and a fitting I might get them taken in
a little bit and I absolutely love this
color normally I don't order things that
are colors you guys know I don't really
tend to wear colors but this one I think
is the most perfect spring color I know
I'm gonna get so much use out of it I
cannot wait to wear this dress and last
but not least for clothing items I got a
top and a skirt they are a mix-and-match
but I'm gonna wear them together as a
set that's why I waited until laughs to
show you but the first thing is this
little top it is the princess Polly
brand got it in a size 8 and it is just
white in roughly and off-the-shoulder
the off-the-shoulder sleeves are ties so
they fit really loose which I like
they're kind of droopy and I love the
way that it fits I love how the bodice
part is very tight and stretchy so it
really fits you well and then the
sleeves of it are very loose and drapey
I like that look the top definitely
stays up a lot which I love and I
actually don't wear a bra with it you
can wear sticky boobs if you want but
you don't have to and to go with that
top I got this white wrap maxi skirts
and I got it in a size 8 it's the
princess Polly brand I don't really know
if you can see because it's kind of
bright since it is white but it just has
a ruffle in the front and it kind of
crosses over and this skirt is super
high-waisted I love how it fits it's so
flattering especially with the white top
that I just showed you they go perfect
together
I cannot wait to wear them with a pair
of gladiator sandals and like some cool
gold jewelry bangles all of that I think
that it's super boho chic and that is
definitely gonna be in my five for the
spring and to finish off the haul I got
a pair of shoes and the brand is called
Bellini and they are these light blue
heels with these dainty little straps
across and then I loved the heel part of
it is wooden and it has a little zipper
up the back I just think that these are
so cute and so timeless you guys know
that my favorite heels are the ones that
just have the one strap and in the front
and then the one around the ankle with
the chunky heel so I thought that I
would branch out get something different
I love the 3 strap detailing on these
they're super cute I know I'm going to
be getting a ton of use out of them so
that concludes my giant haul video I
hope that you guys enjoyed it and that
concludes my princess Polly haul I hope
that you guys enjoyed this video I loved
being able to show you everything that I
got and trying it on for you I think
that everything fits so well it's really
true to size which I love and which is
nice when ordering online I wasn't sure
how any of this was gonna fit but it
ended up working out and fitting
absolutely amazing I will have the
