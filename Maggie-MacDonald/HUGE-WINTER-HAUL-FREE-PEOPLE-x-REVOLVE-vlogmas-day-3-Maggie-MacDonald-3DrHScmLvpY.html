today's video is a giant haul honestly
all of the stuff that I got is so
amazing I'm so excited to show it to you
guys I'm like in the best mood today I'm
like so pumped I'm ready to go all of
these items are so cute they're so
perfect for my vibe right now they're
all comfortable and cute and yeah so I'm
just gonna get right into the video it's
probably gonna be a really long one so
these are some things that I got from
Free People revolve if you guys haven't
heard of revolve it you should totally
check it out it is the most amazing
website it is a online website that has
a bunch of amazing brand and all of
their clothing is super trendy and super
chic it is a little bit expensive but I
did buy all of this on a Black Friday
Cyber Monday so a lot of it was on sale
and I couldn't resist I couldn't help
myself I have to get it all is so cute
so I'm gonna stop ranting and just get
on into the video and give this video a
thumbs up if you like seeing hauls leave
all of your comments down below and yeah
so without further ado let's get started
so the first item that I got from Free
People is just this sweater that I'm
wearing right now it is this a big cream
sweater with these big loose sleeves I
love it I think that it is so perfect
for winter it's honestly the best
material ever it is not like the fuzzy
sweater material if you know what I mean
it's kind of like a knit cotton but I
love it so much it's so heavy I'll stand
up so you guys can see it's oversized
which I really like so it's a little bit
off the shoulder I definitely could have
gotten it in an extra small but I think
that they only had it in a size small
when I was ordering it that's why I got
a size small it is a little bit big but
we can work with it I love the
off-the-shoulder look I just think that
it is so feminine and it just gives you
like such a cute chic look during winter
because for me like I love having my
neck showing I don't like when Sonos are
big and chunky all up in my face so I
think that this one is perfect I love it
love it love it and the next item that I
got is just this a Free People bodysuit
it is white and has a crochet and gold
bar detailing on the top and then in the
it just looks like this I got this a
bodysuit in a size small and I'm so glad
that I did because sometimes in free
people I go down to an extra small I'm
usually an extra small on three people
but for some reason I got this in a
small and it fits me so well it does not
have addressable straps so it's kind of
like crossing my fingers like hopefully
it fits me but it fits me so perfectly I
cannot wait to wear this I'm going on a
trip I'm over Christmas break and this
is definitely gonna be one of the
staples that I'm bringing with me so
yeah I just think that body suits are so
cute and they're so perfect because you
can put them on wear them with pants
shorts jeans skirts literally anything I
think that they're the most perfect
piece ever they're so so so like
effortless and yeah so I really love
this I'm so glad that I picked this up
the next hop that I got is just by the
bridge motel and it is this orange
colored tank top and it ties in the
front right here you'll see in the Tryon
part and then in the back it just has
like a crisscross detailing and it is
cropped but I am so obsessed with this
color right now I've come to the
conclusion that I think that orange is
my color I've tried to wear like hunter
green army green black
none of those colors look good I mean I
just think that this color goes so well
with my dark hair and my dark eyes so
when I saw this tank top I was like yes
cropped and orange I have to get it
because if you guys know me you know
that I love cop shirts so yeah I got
this tank top I think it's gonna be
super cute to wear with like a pair of
denim shorts a denim skirt even like
ripped boyfriend jeans but this is
definitely gonna be a staple in my
closet when the weather gets warmer
again the next thing I got from revolve
is these lovers and friends ripped denim
shorts I'm really excited about these
because they were still really expensive
I know that they were on sale I think
they were around like $70 even on sale
they usually go for about 145 so I was
like you know what they're half off I
really should get them there's such good
quality and I feel like when you put the
money into like denim jeans or denim
shorts and you go a little bit extra and
spend more money you really get the look
that you're trying to go for and like
you get the high-waisted look with the
distressed like rips in them and they
just look so good and they fit you in
all the right places so I was like
I'm gonna spend the extra money I'm
gonna get them I will thank myself
during this summer when all the shorts
are awful price and I'm really sad
because they came in literally today I
just opened up the package and the belt
loop is broken and they were final sale
because it was part of their Cyber
Monday deal and I'm really upset because
these are broken I think I'm just gonna
send an email to the company and see
what they can do about it because I
literally haven't even worn them I
haven't even tried them on and they came
in there like that so I'm really upset
about that but these shorts are so cute
I love the wash I love the distressed
detailing and I'm so excited to wear
them hopefully I can exchange them for a
different pair if not I would be really
really sad and maybe I can like get that
repaired or something but yeah so I
picked these up I'm so happy that I got
them and I got these in a size 26 the
next item that I picked up I was so
excited to get in the mail it's just
this big oversized Free People v-neck
hoodie and it came in like a distressed
heathered gray color and I got this in
an extra small it is super oversight I
can't wait to wear it with a pair of
denim shorts and like combat boots I
just think that that look is gonna be so
different and fun so yeah I've got this
little hoodie and I'm so excited to wear
it next from Free People
I got a cotton jumpsuit and it is kind
of this light cream gray color and it
just has like a V in the front and it is
racerback this is kind of hard to show
you because obviously it's really long
and then it kind of has a drawstring and
detailing in the middle and then just
Falls and it is tight at the ankles and
this is so soft and comfortable the
material is amazing I can't wait to wear
this with like a lace bra lat and like a
pair of gladiator sandals maybe like a
biker jacket or a jean jacket and like
big oversized sunglasses with my hair in
a bun I don't know I have like this
vision of me wearing this jumpsuit
because it's just so easy to just throw
on and go run errands get your nails
done put on a baseball hat I think that
this is so perfect and it's so
effortlessly cute oh my god I'm so
obsessed with this item I
I love these jeans usually jeans don't
look good on me I'm not a jeans person I
will wear Lulu I'm gonna lie until the
day I die but I got these free people
black studded jeans amazing I got them
in a size 28 because I've read the
reviews online and there everyone was
like they won really small so I was like
you know what I'm just gonna size up two
sizes because normally I'm a 26 and
jeans but sometimes I can be a 27 in
them like from Free People I know that
they run really small usually I'm like a
27 but these I gotta know 28 because
I've read the reviews and people were
like they run so small so I was like you
know what I'm gonna go to 28 and they
fit me well on the legs but they don't
fit my waist they're very very big on my
waist because I have like a bigger
bigger thighs and like a bigger butt so
jeans like can be hard for me to work
with jeans don't really fit me right but
I know that if I wear about with these
that these are gonna look amazing but
they're just cease black just stressed
skinny jeans with the stud detailing I
think that they're so cool they're so
different and I cannot wait to put some
outfits together with these next from
three people I just got this black
waffle knit big kind of a line I don't
know if that's what you a symmetrical I
have no idea but it's just one of their
signature waffle knit oversized
long-sleeve shirts I just think that
these are perfect staples to have in
your closet during the winter they're so
easy to throw on with a pair of leggings
and a leather jacket pair of sneakers oh
my new thing is ugh so I could totally
wear these with uggs but I think that
these are so good to have in your closet
they're so easy to throw on
and they look good with everything they
look cute and they're super comfortable
and the next one I got is just this thin
material kind of gray Bell sleeve
sweater and it is cropped I'm know I'm
probably gonna be wearing this when the
weather is a bit warmer when it's like
around the 50s like it was today but I
just think that this sweater is so cute
to wear with a pair of high-waisted
jeans and I love the bell-sleeve
detailing on it I think that it is super
cute the brand is called sleeping on
snow and I got this in a size extra
small then from
people I got this black v-neck sweater
again with the big sleeves and it's the
same exact one as I'm wearing in this
cream color right now but I got the
black one in an extra small and it just
fits me a lot better it's not as
off-the-shoulder as this one but yeah it
definitely fits me really well again
it's a perfect material it's super soft
and it's not fuzzy so if you wear with
yoga pants it's not gonna like rub off
and get little fuzzy things all over it
because that gives me OCD I hate that
but I think that this sweater is gonna
be one of my staples in my closet this
fall I'm gonna wear it a ton I think
that's so comfortable it's like a heavy
sweater so it definitely is gonna keep
you warm and I just think that like the
detailing on it the big sleeves they're
kind of like soft you off the shoulder
look is really really in right now so I
am so excited to wear this then from the
brand doma I just got this really cool
fringe suede jacket it is in a light
gray color and it has fringe detailing
all on the back and all on the front and
the sleeves are a bit short and it's
cropped so it's definitely a jacket that
you should wear like in warmer climates
but I'm so so so obsessed with it I
think that this jacket is super fun and
I can put together so many cute outfits
with it I'm so excited to see what I can
put together I just think that something
like this is a great staple to have in
your closet because it really dresses up
an outfit when you're not really trying
to like dress up and you can like look
effortless that still looks so cute
that's like my vibe effortlessly cute I
swear by it all of my outfits like I
want to be comfortable but I want to
look cute at the same time so black
leggings and a tied t-shirt with this
and some biker boots yeah that's my vibe
something like this and like big
sunglasses and gold jewelry just looking
so cute but also being super comfortable
so I'm so excited to wear this I think
that the fringe detailing is super fun
and it's so in right now so yeah I'm so
excited that I picked this up last but
not least you guys my favorite part of
this whole entire haul
I got another blank NYC leather jacket I
love my blanket more I see leather
jacket that I have
now it's black with like black studs if
you follow me an Instagram you will see
I wear it a ton I always get a ton of
questions about wearing up my leather
jackets and I have to pick this one up
it is just this black leather jacket
with gold detailing buttons buckles
zippers everywhere I think that this is
so fun it's a lot different from my
other leather leather jacket I almost
said Debbie so I definitely have to pick
this one up I love the gold detailing I
love all of the zippers and like the fun
little like not knickknacks but like you
know what do you mean like all of the
detailing on it I just thought was so
amazing and again I can picture myself
wearing this with a black hoodie and
black leggings and like sneakers
sunglasses a hat I think that leather
jackets are perfect for this time of
year leather jackets bomber jackets fur
jackets suede jackets moto jackets all
of the above but yes I love this jacket
oh another thing that I accidentally did

foot for doing this I can't believe I
