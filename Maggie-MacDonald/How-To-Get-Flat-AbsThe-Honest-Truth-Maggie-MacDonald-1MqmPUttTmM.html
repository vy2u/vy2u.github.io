recording this whole entire thing
because all of my 20 minutes worth of
footage just got deleted so where to
start where to start
hey everyone welcome back to my channel
in today's video I am going to be
getting really real with you guys after
yesterday's video I read all the
comments read all of the messages that I
got on tumblr all my DMS everything and
I came to the conclusion that I was
going to do a video today about as you
can see in the title how to get a flat
stomach and how to have abs
I feel like this topic comes up so much
right now because health and fitness is
such a trend in the world it never used
to be like this before the last couple
of years I think I might've been like
three or four years health and fitness
like people were not as into it as they
are now and with social media growing
there are so many fitness gurus out
there and like girls on Instagram just
sharing their fitness advice with
everybody and posting pictures and
things like that and I know it happens
to me but obviously I go on Instagram
and I scroll through and I see these
amazing women and I look at them and
it's like oh my god wow their body is
amazing they have flat stomachs they
have abs like what do they do I want to
be like that and I made this video today
just to give you guys my tips and tricks
on how to have a flat stomach I know
myself I do not have apps I'm not and
who are close to having them but I have
over the years been really working on my
diet and exercise so I just wanted to
share all of the information that I live
by with all of you and I made a list on
my phone just so I stay on track with
this video I don't want to start
rambling on and make this too long I
just really want to get to the point and
let you guys know my tips and tricks and
just give you all the information that I
have and a special announcement that I
wanted to make is that I just decided
today that throughout the whole 30-day
challenge that I'm doing every single
week is going to have a theme so based
on yesterday in today's video this whole
entire week is going to be dedicated to
health and fitness I'm going to be
making a ton of videos just to share all
of the different things through that
topic like
have to do with health and fitness with
you guys so I am so excited I cannot
wait to begin this whole entire journey
with you all so I just thought today
would be an awesome day just to sit down
and get really real with you guys
I'm not wearing I'm basically not even
wearing any makeup I'm wearing a tank
top in sweatpants and I just wanted to
sit down and talk to you guys as if we
were all best friends because you know
what if you guys are following along
with my channel and you follow my social
medias like that is so cool to me and it
means so much to me I just want to be
able to sit down as friends as girls
well if you're a boy too then that's
totally fine but I don't know I just
thought that I just would get really
real and personal and just tell you guys
the honest truth in what it is like for
me and how I maintain a flat stomach so
without further ado let's get on into
the video there are three topics that I
wanted to touch upon today I made a
little list on my phone so I can try to
help myself stay organized like I said
so the first topic that I'm going to
talk about is your diet when wanting a
flat stomach and trying to maintain a
flat stomach the first thing that will
pop into anybody's head will be ab
workouts going to the gym spending hours
at the gym which personally and through
my own experience that is not the case I
have not worked out all summer I was so
busy working and just being with my
family and trying to make the most out
of the little time that I had off from
work so going to the gym was not a
priority for me I would go for runs here
and there but I never once stepped foot
into a gym during the summer and I never
once did an ab workout and for me
personally diet is the number one thing
that helps me maintain a flat stomach
when I put good things into my body and
I eat well then that is when I feel my
best and for the first thing that I want
to talk about was coffee I am an
advocate
you drink our I drink coffee every
single day and personally I drink black
coffee I don't put any added sugars in
it I don't put any sweeteners nothing no
milk no cream just black coffee and it
is an acquired taste but I promise you
little by little just ease away from all
the things that you put into it and then
you will learn to like black coffee I'm
telling you try this out and then let me
know in a few months and I guarantee
that you will like the taste of it next
whenever I eat I always make sure that
my meals have a lot of protein and
vegetables in them I like to eat a lot
of chicken vegetables salads salmon
shrimp things like that for breakfast
every single morning I eat two eggs with
toast and then throughout the day I
might have like a salad with salmon and
then for dinner I'll have like some
chicken and vegetables so throughout the
day I just really like to have my meals
contain a lot of protein it gives me a
lot more energy and just helps feel me
throughout the whole entire day next on
the list is the topic that if you're in
college everybody will understand and it
is alcohol and being completely honest
with you
yes I drink in college but throughout
the whole entire summer I was so busy
that I never had time to go out with my
friends so I didn't consume any alcohol
over the summer and I came back to
school and I went out with my friends a
few times and honestly just the feeling
that it gave me made me feel so sick and
to me it's not worth it to throw away
all of my fitness goals and just kind of
like get me off track by drinking
alcohol it does not have any health
benefits for you it doesn't do anything
for your body other than make you gain
weight last year I did go out with my
friends a lot more than I had in the
past and I always wondered I was like
why is my stomach not as flat as it used
to be during the summer and like why am
i working out so hard in not seeing any
results and one of the main reasons was
alcohol consumption because your body
does not know how to store the alcohol
so it stores and ask that it does not
have any nutritional value what
so ever so if you are trying to have a
flat stomach I definitely would try to
stay away from alcohol and going along
with that just because a food is labeled
healthy and on the label it says it's
non-gmo it's vegan it's gluten-free this
and that just because it says all those
things it is not considered necessarily
healthy for you I have a few lists of
foods that I try to enjoy in moderation
just because I feel like they're so high
in the amount of calories that they have
per serving that when I eat them I don't
want to just eat like the small serving
size so I may go overboard which is not
good for you in the long run so a list
of foods that are very high in calories
and that you should make sure that you
are consuming in moderation are nuts in
nut butters dried fruits granola and
oils last year also I lived on my own in
an apartment for the first time so I was
going out and doing all the grocery
shopping for myself and as a college
student it's easy to kind of get off
track and buy foods that you buy just
because like they're easy I would buy a
lot of peanut butter
i buy nuts I cooked everything with
olive oil which was my biggest mistake
because honestly those foods are all so
high in calories and their serving size
is very small so I was consuming a lot
of them and it was actually making it
harder for me to reach my fitness goal
so you just want to always be mindful of
what you're putting into your body and
not saying that you have to count the
amount of calories are you eating but
just be aware of the serving sizes when
you are going to eat things try to eat
things that have less amount of calories
rather than something that has a lot one
of the most important things that I'm
gonna touch upon in this video is
drinking water you guys I cannot stress
this enough water is so good for you it
has so many amazing health benefits it's
recommended that you drink 3 liters of
water a day and that is what I do I've
got this big swell bottle right here it
is exactly 1 litre so I have to drink 3
of these a day there's I think
half left in this one and this is my
third so I will have reached my water
goal for the day after I finished this
drinking water is so good for you it's
just gonna clear your skin it's gonna
brighten up your skin it's just gonna
make you glow from within and it's also
going to help when you I don't know how
to explain it but it's just overall so
good for you and it's really gonna help
you if you are trying to get a flat
stomach not necessarily build abs but
definitely help tone you out the next
topic that I wanted to address is sleep
you should be getting at least eight
hours of sleep every single night
obviously I'm not a doctor
but it is just recommended that you get
at least eight hours of sleep and by
getting a lot of sleep it just allows
your body to recharge and reboot itself
and get ready so you can start fresh the
next day when I started to get eight
hours of sleep at night and drink 3
liters of water every single day that's
really when I started to see results in
my fitness journey honestly you can go
to the gym for hours a day but if you
are not eating well not drinking enough
water and not getting enough sleep I
promise you that you will not see the
results that you want and it is going to
be very frustrating and so the last
topic that I wanted to talk about today
was exercise yes everybody thinks that
if they go to the gym for hours every
single day that you are going to get
toned and you're gonna have the best
body ever and you're gonna have a flat
stomach you're gonna have abs and you're
gonna look like all of these Fitness
Instagram models all over the world and
while yes exercise is extremely
important many of you guys do not know
that it is 80% diet and 20% exercise so
when I go to the gym I like to
incorporate cardio into my workouts
whether that be hit cardio or less
cardio and hit cardio is high-intensity
interval training so usually for a hit
workout I will get on the treadmill and
I'll sprint for 30 seconds as hard as I
can and then rest for 30 seconds and
I'll repeat that for about 10 to 15
minutes whatever I'm feeling and that
will be
how do you work out for the day but if
I'm not feeling something as high
intense as my hid workout I will do a
list workout and that is just a low
intensity steady speed workout I usually
go on the treadmill and put up the
incline to nine and walk on an incline
to the speed three or three point two
and then I'll just put my headphones in
watch a youtube video and do that for 45
minutes and I think something else that
is really important to getting a flat
stomach is just trying to keep your life
active and by that I mean like when I go
to class I always walk to class I never
take the bus
I don't really ask for rides I would
rather just walk get out there get some
exercise enjoy the fresh air I try to
stay as active as I possibly can
and last but not least this goes into
the first thing that I talked about your
diet I just wanted to say that you guys
should not restrict yourself and I
understand that everybody wants to live
a healthy lifestyle and eat healthy and
salads fruits vegetables and that's
great but it is so unrealistic honestly
I love ice cream I love desserts and if
I want an ice cream cone I'm gonna have
one I'm not gonna restrict myself
because I feel like restricting yourself
just makes it worse and you are going to
eat more things and end up eating more
in the long run if you don't just give
yourself what your body wants and needs
so I do not recommend restricting
yourself honestly my mom has always
taught me that everything is good in
moderation I'm not gonna eat ice cream
every single meal every single day but
it is one of my favorite things so once
in a while yeah I'm gonna go out with my
sister and I'm gonna get an ice cream or
I'll go with my family and get one and
it's totally fine and it is completely
normal to live like that honestly I
could not go living my life without
eating desserts or sweets or stuff like
that I just really tried to have
everything in moderation so I hope this
video was helpful to you guys I'm so
excited to make all of my videos this
week about health and fitness I'm going
to
having so many more videos to come on
this topic so that concludes today's
video about how I maintain a flat
stomach I hope that you guys found this
