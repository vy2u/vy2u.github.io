done with my economics exam
I took it in bed on my laptop because is
the beauty of online classes in college
so right now I am just finishing up
uploading today's video it's going way
down there right now it's uploading I'm
having some coffee and I'm gonna get my
day started I have all of this stuff
that I need to go through do a little
haul I need to go through my closet
clean it out and start posting a lot of
stuff on my Poshmark because look I have
so much stuff and I don't wear half of
it so I'm gonna go through a lot of my
Lululemon's I'm gonna get rid of just a
couple of pairs that I don't really wear
anymore a couple shirts some body suits
I'm gonna do that now start my day bring
you guys along with me and I hope you
enjoy finally just felt ready thank God
I got dressed for the day ot D new lines
that are like a olive green color which
I really like then I'm just wearing my
favorite blank NYC leather jacket this
little cropped Brandi sweatshirt and
these shoes which I have been getting so
many questions about and they are my
zebra
Easy's and I got these from yes Yeezy
calm I'll show you guys the box that
they come in I have them in my closet
and it's up here so here's the box that
they come in
it says 350 on the top boost on the side
and then it just has all of the
information about the shoe size price
everything right there this side just
says Yeezy boost 350 made by adidas
adidas comm slash Kanye
and let's open this up and this is what
it came inside of the box I don't really
know what these are but it's just this
easy boost designed by Kanye West little
booklet thing with like pictures of
different Yeezy like it's kind of like a
flip book I don't really even know what
this is it looks like a little notepad
umm actually maybe that's what it is but
yeah so that came in it I don't even
know what that is
this is a receipt right here
it just has like footlocker and all of
the info on it and back here is the
little tag that came on the shoes and
these just have like all the information
about the sneakers it has like the name
the size the color all of that info that
normally just comes on shoes and
whatever so I just keep all that and
there these are the shoes themselves
they've never been worn that's why I'm
putting them on my bed I just got the
zebra print ones and they have the red
writing on the side which I'm obsessed
with I love red right now so I really
liked this detailing I wanted to get the
all-black ones with the red stripe on
the side but they didn't have my size
and then I was thinking of getting the
orange ones with the will the great ones
with the orange right here like with the
stripe that's orange but I was like you
know what for my first pair I cannot be
that impulsive and got something that I
can only wear with certain outfits so I
got these ones right here and I haven't
worn them yet but honestly they're so
comfortable and they are such great
quality I'm absolutely obsessed with
them so if you guys want to check out
the website the yes easy.com
I will have all of the information down
below but honestly look at these they
are so perfect they are in such great
condition they've never been worn brand
new I just thought that these would be
the perfect sneaker because like look at
this outfit
this outfit is just like the best vibe
for winter in my own opinion this is
like what I would wear every single day
it's kind of like a models off-duty like
street style look and I just think that
the easies added to the outfit it's just
the perfect touch I think that they look
so amazing so I'll definitely be going
on yes easy calm and getting another
pair I have to look at the ones that
they have I know that they have so many
different pairs of Adidas shoes they
have Nike too but the main reason why I
went on the site was because they had
Easy's and they also have the adidas
nmds I found out the ones that I have in
my closet right here these are the
adidas undies that are kind of like
socks I got those I think at the mall at
like finish line or something and then
these ones I got on the adidas website
last year I bought them for Christmas
well I didn't buy them I got them for a
gift for Christmas so I have these two
pairs of nmds and then I just added
these to my collection I'm absolutely
loving them right now so if you guys
want a pair of Yeezys just like these
head over to yes easy calm and check
them out again I will have all the
information to their website and stuff
linked down below they have amazing
customer service the shipping is so fast
and the prices are amazing so I think
you guys should definitely go check them
out and now I'm gonna go do bit of
errands I have to return this package
right here to forever 21 this one to
revolve I'm returning the shorts for my
haul that were ripped so that'll be good
I have to go to the post office until I
get some stuff for that and I also need
to go grocery shopping because I
literally do not have one thing in my
fridge
Oh
so mondays are usually like a huge
runnin around day for me and I have to
like get all my stuff done today like I
don't know just like the start of the
week kind of get back into things and I
went grocery shopping so quickly as you
could have seen like in this better
clip from before I picked up a few items
and I just got my favorite cinnamon
raisin is the keel bread I also got
these light 100-calorie Thomas English
muffins because I've been craving an
English muffin with like crunchy peanut
butter on it like sliced banana so I got
those then I also picked up just some
eggs because you guys know I have eggs
and toast every single morning then I
just got two little bananas put those
over to the side then I also picked up
two apples
these are Portland apples I really just
like having these first snack I think
that throw the perfect snack and they
keep you really full and you'll be a lot
of energy so I picked those up then I
got a little cup of mixed berries just
some blueberries in school just some
blueberries and strawberries to add to
my yogurt or eat like if I want a little
quick bite of something then I got three
of my favorite yogurts just the plain
non-fat Chobani Greek yogurts and I also
got a box of baby spinach so I can make
a little salad if I'm feeling a salad
and also add spinach in two of my
scrambled eggs in the morning if I need
like some extra greens that day and then
last two items this big cucumber and
some baby carrots so that is what I
picked up at the store so I get to the
post office to get the little package
that wasn't able to be delivered to my
apartment I was like wait this is so
weird like why can't this be delivered
to my apartment like I wonder what it is
and they came up and it was like a
little tiny envelope and I knew that it
had like something international on it
and I was like wait that's so weird I
know I didn't order anything like I
could not think of what I got it at the
moment and I opened it up and it was
this little box
right here at this little back box and I
was like we actually did order something
so this is the package that could not be
delivered to my apartment because it is
a 14 karat gold necklace and it says
Scorpio on it in gold and I ordered this
because wait hold on my mom is calling
hello okay thank you but what time
should I make the appointment for what
about like three yeah okay cool okay I'm
excited love you bye
yeah wait what was I just saying about
my necklace sorry oh I got this necklace
um I got it real gold rather than like
not real because I used to wear my Urban
Outfitters Scorpio and necklace like
every single day I wore it religiously
and it turned kind of like not gold
anymore it was starting to kind of like
turn gray and it looks like dingy so I
was like you know what like I'm gonna
treat myself and I'm gonna get like a
real gold necklace so that's why they
didn't deliver this and leave it in my
box because I wasn't there over the
weekend and if someone stole it that
would have been really bad so I got a
few things in the mail today I just
wanted to show you guys really quick and
it is by the brand real her I'll talk
more about this brand in a video like if
I do a look with these but they sent me
what is this the faux show eyelash
adhesive maybe it's a little mascara I
don't know what it is but I can't use
that whatever it is because I've eyelash
extensions
this is a plumping lip gloss I wonder if
they have the color why is this not
focusing it looks like it is a nude
color and it's called I am awesome
and then this lipstick right here is
just a red color I am perfect
oh that's cool I am awesome I am perfect
and then the real her playbook which i
think is like an eyeshadow palette I'm
really excited to use all of these I'm
definitely gonna be doing a holiday
inspired makeup look for like any
holiday parties or anything you might be
going to so give this video a thumbs up
if you would like to see me play around
with these products and do a little
makeup tutorial I'm going to meet Julie
enough to do right now and I'm just
gonna wear the same outfit that I've
been wearing all day my Yeezys with
these green online pants and then this
sports about that I got from forever 21
and my deed has happened so I'm going to
put on like a little crop sweatshirt to
go to the gym got my favorite little
Starbucks cup that I drink water out of
all day got my Apple watch got my beets
like you guys saw in my workout routine
video if you haven't seen it you should
totally check it out but I'm gonna get
my jacket now cuz I think we're gonna go
get dinner after together on campus at
school so I'm just gonna bring my big
jacket and I'm gonna put back on my
brandy melville crop sweatshirt just so
I can like cover up a little bit oh my
god guys look at this little thing that
my friend got me isn't this a cutest
little thing ever but yeah so I'm gonna
do with that now I have to meet her at
five so I'm gonna leave and get after it
my god it's literally so cold out I
didn't see my breath but I just finished
up at the gym with Jillian and then we
got dinner together so it was really fun
but the workout that I did if you guys
are curious I feel like I'm gonna get
questions like what workout did you do
at the gym I did the same workout that
my workout routine video from August a 1
so you should totally go check that out
but I can't wait to get in my car
freezing then I'm gonna go home shower
chill and I need to go to bed early
tonight because I have an 8 o'clock
class in the morning and then I have
it's such a busy day tomorrow I think I
want to go buy my mum's Christmas
present tomorrow and like get all my
Christmas and I want to get all my
Christmas shopping done so I think I'm
gonna do that so I'm gonna end the vlog
here just got back to my apartment and
yeah I just wanted to show you guys kind
of what a little day and my life would
be like honestly that's why I don't vlog
every single day and why my vlogmas is
kind of mixed in with like regular
videos and vlogs just because when I'm
at school my days kind of consist of me
like running a bunch of errands and like
doing like crazy things and just like
running around all day long I've class
in the morning and I'm out by like 10:45
and then I like front a bunch of errands
and I do videos and I edit I upload and
I go to the gym I go to the post office
like I'm always doing crazy things so
it's just like really not that much fun
in my opinion to like watch I feel like
it wouldn't be something that you guys
like would want to see so that's why I
kind of just wanted to do something like
that today because like this is my
typical Monday just what I usually do in
a day to give you guys kind of like a
little idea I thought that it would be
kind of cool just to like bring you guys
along with me but leave your thoughts
about this type of blog down below
because I really want to know what you
guys think so I'm gonna take a shower
now and then I am going to get in bed
and do a bunch of work on my computer
I'm gonna edit this vlog a little bit
plan my videos for later in the week I
have some exciting things coming later
in the week definitely want to stay to
do you don't want to miss it if you're
not subscribed already make sure that
you are subscribed but yeah so I need to
go take a shower and get my life
together get ready for bed I have an 8
o'clock class in the morning so I need
to like get after it get a bunch of
