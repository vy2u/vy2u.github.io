today's video I'm gonna be doing a
little storytime you guys liked my last
story time video and you requested to
see more so the other day I thought of
the perfect story to tell you and
honestly this is so crazy I cannot
believe that this happened to me I'm
scarred for life and I have no words I
don't even know what to say so I'm gonna
get right into that and explain this to
you guys if you like story time videos
just give this video a thumbs up and
without further ado let's get started so
this story starts off my freshman year
of college I'm now a junior but when I
was a freshman so two years ago I was
living in the main freshman dorm on
campus at my school and I go to
Bridgewater State University in
Massachusetts and on our campus we have
this a big dorm called Shan jargon and
there's like I think eight hundred
freshmen that lived there and it's five
floors and there was a site called Shay
and a side called Dorian and I lived on
the fifth floor of Shay and my freshman
year I remember leaving my English class
and this boy who was in my class
obviously since you're a freshman like
you're trying to make friends and
interact with other people so he came up
to me like when we were all walking back
to the dorm together and he was like so
like what floor do you live on like blah
blah blah just like the basic questions
that you ask someone wouldnt you meet
them and I was like oh I live on find
Shay like what about you and he goes you
live on five Shay your floor is so
haunted like saying all the stuff about
how like there's ghosts on my floor and
like all these crazy stories I decided
and I'm like what are you talking about
like my dorm is literally not haunted my
rooms not haunted I know that it's not
like it's just one of those things that
like I thought people were just saying
it like oh my god she dragons haunted
like fifth floor Shay but literally I
sat there for a sec and I was like hold
on this was like the third week into
school and a Thursday night like the
week before my three roommates that they
live with they all went out and I had a
test on Friday morning so I didn't end
up going out so I stayed in and I
remember sleeping and my roommate Amanda
had like Christmas lights hanging above
her bed so I left those on just because
like when they all got home like they
would have turned them off and stuff I
wasn't really like
not much into it so I wake up amel
tonight at like 1 o'clock in the morning
and I wear glasses but I wasn't wearing
them at the time obviously cuz obviously
think so I wake up and I'm like looking
over anime in his bed and all of our
beds were in a straight line my bed
Katie's bed Lily's bed at Madison and so
I'm looking all the way over across the
room had Amanda's I like to see if they
came home and I saw a figure this little
girl wearing a white t-shirt she had
short brown hair and she was facing the
wall just like sitting on the bed and
you know when you open up your eyes when
you're sleeping and you like see kind of
like blobs but it's not really anything
and you really rub your eyes and then
it'll like go away
so I rubbed my eyes and it wouldn't go
away but I was like wait like that's
definitely just in my head and I'm like
I'm just overthinking this like whatever
I didn't think anything of it I just
went back to bed so after the kid tells
me that my brooms haunted I'm like wait
oh my god like I actually did see
something in music what did you see like
one of my friends who lives on the fifth
floor like she also saw something in her
room as well and so I told him I was
like I saw a girl a little girl with
short hair wearing a white t-shirt and
she was just like sitting facing the
wall he was like shut up
my friend literally saw the same exact
thing I was like oh my god then I
started to get freaked out I was like
what are you kidding me like I'm bugging
out then as the year went on I found out
that this ghost in my room she got
killed by her boyfriend
in the dorm and he like put her into a
closet and then she came back and like
now Hans our dorm building and we have
to train Jack's right next to my dorm
that I lived in
I think the train goes right to Boston
so every single night at the last train
which is round like 1 o'clock in the
morning the ghost will come to the dorm
and she'll be there all night until the
first train leaves to go back to Boston
at 4 o'clock in the morning so I'm not
kidding you when I tell you that I would
lay in my bed and if I was like trying
to fall asleep once it hit one o'clock
like I would get the weirdest feeling
ever my chest would get so heavy and I
literally would sweat I would lay in bed
and like be like why am I feeling like
this like something felt like it was
just weighing on me
it honestly was because I felt the
presence of her in the room in her in
the dorm and I never actually saw her
like after the first time I did see her
but some of my roommates had like
experiences where she would do things
and it would just be like wicked freaky
my roommate Amanda was getting ready one
day and she was doing her makeup sitting
at her desk and had like her little
mirror in front of her and in her mirror
like it was starting to tilt a little
bit and her closet was behind her and
like she turned around on all of a
sudden her all of her jackets fell in
her closet like that literally would not
have happened ever and another thing
that happened is she was also getting
ready one day and Kate in Kaylee's desk
she had like her Clarisonic and stuff
her Clarisonic turned on and was like
vibrating and Amanda had to go and shut
it off and then the third time something
else happened in our room was when oh
this all this stuff always happens to
Amanda I don't know why I would amend
and I were the only ones who experienced
something like that like I actually saw
the ghost and Amanda just experienced
all the weird stuff and another time she
was getting ready and the doors to our
closets all literally slammed and
they're very heavy like there are these
big wooden heavy doors and the windows
weren't open it wasn't windy that day
like they slammed out of nowhere and it
was so weird and also people said that
when they were there for pre-season like
I know a lot of the volleyball girls and
like field hockey girls we're living in
the dorm during pre-season before anyone
had moved in and they said that they
literally would hear footsteps and
people running up and down the hallways
and door slamming and there would be
nobody in the dorm because like they
were the only ones there and once I got
to actually like know about the ghosts
and like I like people had talked about
everybody had like share their
experiences this one girl oh my god she
was an um a junior last year she was an
RA and she said that her freshman year
she was living on the fifth floor Shay
and she woke up in the middle of the
night and she was literally sitting at
the end of her bed and she screamed in
her face and ran out and slam the door
like crazy things happened to a bunch of
people like they'll be in the bathroom
the hot water would turn really hot or
like the water was shut off just like
random things but ones like the year
went on and I got to know more girls on
the on my floor I think this was April I
met these two girls and we're all
sitting in our common room
and we started talking about the ghosts
because these girls are the only other
ones who have experienced something like
I experienced and we were talking about
it we literally would see the same exact
things these girls would wake up and
they would see the little girls standing
oh my god I just literally just got
chills I'm so freaked out
these girls saw the ghost and she would
be standing and just facing the door
facing the wall if she you never saw her
face she never showed her face but and
then another thing that happened oh my
god this is literally crazy another
thing that happened was I would have
dreams that I was being possessed and
like being dragged off of my bed and I'd
be like holding onto my sheets and like
screaming and my roommate Amanda who was
a girl who saw like who experienced all
like the crazy things with the ghosts
she'd be on the ground getting possessed
and I'd be calling for help and she
wouldn't be able to help me because she
was getting possessed and I'm not
kidding you guys the girl that lived up
mahal for me that we were talking to had
these same exact reasons as me we both
had the same dreams it was the weirdest
thing everything we talked about it all
one night and we were just like oh my
god like this is so freaky so yeah that
is a story of my freshman year dorm
being haunted it was the scariest moment
of my life
I literally would go home every single
weekend because I just did not want to
be there alone I didn't want to be in
the room alone I was so freaked out but
ever since then I haven't felt like that
anymore like I haven't had that heavy
feeling in my chest I haven't
experienced any like anything weird like
I did when I lived in the dorm so I know
that it definitely was because my dorm
was haunted so i 100% believe in ghosts
i believe in all that stuff and
experienced it firsthand and yeah so if
you ever are in Bridgewater or if you go
to Bridgewater State University and you
live in Chandler again just don't live
on the fifth floor of Shay all the other
floors are finest we're just not fit for
Shay I hope you guys enjoyed in this
little story time video again like I
said if you like story times just give

you tomorrow bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
