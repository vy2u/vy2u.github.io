so bad but listen to the little story so
we get in the car at 8 o'clock we're
like rushing to get out pack up all of
our bags get in the car get to Seoul
first we just hop at Starbucks then we
have to get an uber like this big whole
fiasco and I'm at Starbucks and I'm like
you know what great time to vlog and
start my day off because obviously we've
been going every morning so I'm like you
know what it's our last day I'm gonna
vlog gonna show Seoul gonna do all that
and I go into my bag and I'm like
rushing rushing rushing I'm like wait
where's my camera and then I'm like oh
my god was I miss on my camera because
they didn't charge it last night so I
didn't realize that I didn't have it and
then I was like I put it down at the
diner last night I'm like at like 11
o'clock and I remember taking a photo
and Spencer being like get your camera
out of the way get the strap out of the
way and I pushed it way in the corner of
the table so basically it's Spencer song
not mine but anyway so I ended up
leaving my camera at the diner and I was
freaking out this morning I'm like oh my
god my camera I've lost it blah blah
blah so I'm just like okay we'll go get
your stuff from Starbucks we need to go
like we're trying to hustle here and so
I'm like okay yeah you're right whatever
like if needed I'll just lose all the
content that I had a memory card I'll
just have to get new camera whatever
life stuff happens and so I come into
Starbucks and he just got off the phone
with a diner and he was like Maggie I'm
so sorry like I don't know what to say
they don't have your camera yeah but
like we got to go you gotta hustle you
guys have Seoul at 9:30 like your uber
like you have to get in the uber and
Gretchen was like Maggie come on come on
and I was just like oh my god like
standing in the parking lot I was like
okay whatever like let's just go when I
was so upset I was like oh my god like I
cannot believe I did that
and so then we had our whole morning we
went to Seoul we went to Paradise Bowls
and finally I guess I can the car to go
to the airport and look like he had my
camera so we're back in action I didn't
this is the view from Spencer's
apartment this is insane at one of these
apartments and I will sit right here and
drink my coffee is edit my videos in the
morning we wanna graduate college and my
boat will be right out there and I'm
gonna go for a walk along here I love
this place so much this is so sad we're
saying bye dispenser I'm gonna cry
this is so sad Emma's crying
raising means yes you will love you came
to California with me more than I needed
anyway I literally didn't wear anything
I packed so that's that but let's see if
I even make it through with all of this
stuff I came I came and I'm leaving
white
I know came here with a fake tan leaving
white my bag was 57 on the way here and
now on the way home it was no oh my god
I'm carrying all of this stuff I brought
so much stuff but now it's 50 to 1 I
have to take America back over just to
come to put in my bag it's real great
way to put some adenine for flying
American Airlines home and I thought I
love to JetBlue until I got on this
plane and what the hell they not have
free Wi-Fi I don't know what that's cool
I love Joe but I like American right now
I'm gonna you do need it it's so helpful
but I have to edit so much right now on
the thing that's just good it'll be like
time to do that and then hopefully I'll
sleep a little
it's so sad to be clear
but obviously I could have such a great
time you guys so needless to say
is irrelevant
like what probably do not waking up with
each other every single morning no one
like going to Starbucks and me out door
and working out with it I'm sad I'm
actually genuinely sad and I need to put
on a jacket because I know my god I'm so
sad it's 12:30 hopefully this doesn't
take a long time because I need
this is so sad we have to say bye I'm
fat but it's not like we're never gonna
see each other again we literally live
like you right now each other so it's
fine
but I'm gonna miss our Linh so much I'm
sad I really miss California so we had
so much fun now I have to drive all the
way back to my apartment but it's really
not gonna be that bad because right now
it feels like 9:30 but really it's 1:30
yeah so
but my bag a better hurry up I need to
change out of this outfit I look
disgusting but I guess we can end off
the blog here any last words
