they pulled up front and they were like
you can go by yourself and they're
trying to decide like who's gonna come

get a frozen banana walnut California
because why don't love bananas and - I
love chocolate so frozen bananas dipped
in chocolate this is really cute and
yeah so I'm gonna get one right now they
remind me of the little frozen banana
things that go bananas from Trader Joe's
those are literally my favorite so I'm
gonna see what they have and yeah that
was so quick and easier off getting it

it but that's my little frozen banana
and they dipped in chocolate and then
put peanuts on it oh and I'm still

I'm what's changing but we're finally
we're but we're getting chips and guac
it's Friday so many writer Marguerite
Wow I'm getting so high for dinner I
know their time oh my god I'm so hungry
and we're all wearing old eating and
merchants or literally freezing it
dating I'm gonna put mine on to match my
black outfit that I'm worried right now
but let's get after it I'm literally so
hungry holy so I skipped the part
where we I ate one little baby churro
okay so I skipped the part where we vlog
at dinner and I guess now this is where
we end up at Krispy Kreme because you
know already hate terms you know what I
don't care honestly
but I'm a mess like like right now I
honestly haven't had a Krispy Kreme
donut since I was done in California
when I was in eighth grade so when you
Christine I'm like you gotta send it oh
my god
we have nothing like this in Boston so
when you come to California you actually
do a full scent and then obviously we
get medical attention but oh my god this
is insane
this is crazy
oh my god shut up look how many
different ones that there are what I
didn't know that there was different
cutting you're kidding
look at the many ones
at least one we're doing a taste test
and these are the cleanest
there's so late it's areata
the camera guy these are so good
I knew I liked that place they were soon
as we go in to celebrate 80k with
Gretchen and she baby bass amp all of a
donut and it was so good it was the best
thing I've ever had and honestly that
one Jonah that we had was only 190
calories like that's not even that's
really not even that bad because I eat
like pints of Ettinger yep that's Ben
and Jerry's at the time and I think that
over a thousand I think that's bad so
yeah I literally been sitting shotgun
this whole trip and now Kings it's like
all of a sudden cleans it so now I so
now I'm gonna be like I'm surfing the
backseat okay they just sad to me and
I'm sad I miss her but I need one man he
really needs to take me meatball what
time is it it's only 9:00
but it feels so much later because
obviously it's like three hours behind
for dinner we went to a really good
Mexican place and I got fish tacos and
then that we ate like a bunch of chips
and salsa and guacamole and stuff and it
was really really good and we got
churros for dessert near so bomb it
honestly I'm so full
but you're on vacation and in California
so I guess I just go to Sunday and I
feel like I need to try all these
different foods while I'm here or so
that's what you got to do when you're on
vacation but then obviously once I get
back to Massachusetts I'm gonna get
after enough gym
I'm getting after at the gym in the
morning so it really doesn't matter
anyway
we're going back to Mike's and we're
gonna do a full set in the morning</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
