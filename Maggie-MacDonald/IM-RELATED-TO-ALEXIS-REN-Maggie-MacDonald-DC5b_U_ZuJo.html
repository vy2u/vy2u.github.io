it for me
hey guys welcome back to my channel as
you can see today I'm here with my
sister and if you follow me on instagram
you will know who my sister is we I post
a lot of stuff with her and if you
follow her then obviously you'll know
our sister but her name is Emma and she
is you want to say how was your I'm 16
and I'm 20 so we're four and a half more
I'm going to be 21 so we're four and a
half years apart yeah but she is a
junior in high school I'm a junior in
college and so we're gonna do the sister
tag today and we have the list of 25
questions that we're gonna answer right
here so without further ado let's get
started okay so yeah we do look like our
phone cases catch up well you look like
mine catch up and I'm yours mustard you
can't really see it cuz it's like a
light yellow but oh we're on that brandy
boho vibe today so question number one
who is the oldest and who's the youngest
yes we just talked about that she's 16
I'm 20 question number two what do you
like and hate about your sister I hate
how okay I have a good one for you I
have a good one okay so when what I hate
okay no I'm gonna start with what I hate
so I can back it up with my so what I
hate is like today when you took that
shirt out of my closet without telling
me that you're gonna wear a tube time
then you asked me if you could wear it
after you put it on I ready in the hole
okay you're not asking okay and then
what I love about you what do you love
mommy I think you're my best friend
okay what I hate I'll start off with my
heat okay sometimes I hate when you're
so monotone in text messages like if I
text you and
are you a speck of what should I wear
today and I'll take these you know okay
okay well if I tux - did I say thank you
should wear this this and this then you
text me back and you're just like okay
like you just say okay I know age oh yes
yeah like you're just very monotone oh
and another thing I don't like actually
that's so mean I feel like whenever you
text me and you're like what should I
wear today and I don't really know what
you should wear and then that just like
frustrates me but anyway what I like
about you well there's so many things I
can't just say one probably the fact
that like we're so close and you really
are my best friend because honestly your
sister is gonna be there for you no
matter what because we've done
everything together we've grown up
together we you get the gist so anyway I
just feel like your sisters gonna be
there for you through everything and to
have your sister also be your best
friend is like the best thing ever
question number three what do you and
your sister have in common everything
every literally everything there's not
one thing that we don't agree on yeah
like if we are going out to eat and we
ordered we get some singing and the same
thing and we share if you can come in to
be like okay we'll be like to want to
get this thing and I'll beg yeah but I
want to get this one a little then we
can't have half and half like what we
did that's why I think we really just
have Mike gets mad at us cuz you get the
same thing sometimes yeah we just have
like the same interest in life
everything number four
what is your funniest memory oh my god I
know what it is I know what the funny
memory is you say it first isn't often
when we were on the bus and the day of
Mike's graduation was so funny or so
funny the day
in addition you would oh my god the
video you have to send it to me and I'll
put it in right here
her dad gets so mad at us because little
do you guys know that like he's probably
gonna see this that you don't see in
like whatever but we're not close with
our dad and me to kind of argue with him
a lot and so it's like he was getting so
mad at us and you sir having really fast
my brother's college like no I think
there's a like not like that yeah just
like got on the highway like start to
speed up and so our brothers college is
like three hours away so he was already
in the car with us for three hours and
he speeds up and it's like going fast
and we were like why don't you just hear
their engine revving in the back and I'm
just gonna we're gonna put a video here
just to explain it but yeah that's my
funniest memory that whole day what
keeping your sister's do for fun we take
pictures we go like out to eat okay if
we were gonna have a fun day honestly
this is what we would do we get up we
like work out or go to yoga or something
meets yeah well we wouldn't even maybe
shower but let me go to Trader Joe's no
but like we'd go right over close we go
to Trader Joe's and get food please love
our job we go grocery shopping we'd get
a Starbucks or our Marylou's we go to
Whole Foods and get lunch like we would
do that like we would run errands like
that's probably the funnest day that we
have it's just like running remember
that time you pick me from school early
and we just went anywhere that's more
that's like what we do for fun and we
also like to go to Boston when I go
shopping and like walk around so number
six
describe your sister in one word
beautiful I know what I'm trying to I
can't describe it in one where though
like you know how you are you're like oh
go nobly bubbly yes you think I am very
bubbly early thank you

have you ever liked one of her friends I
haven't like leg leg leg leg
arlynn is number eight what's your
nickname people call what I don't know
that's we're doing what's your nickname
people call that so it says you don't
have a nickname Emma
someone must make of me eMac okay that's
weird
but we don't really have nicknames
people call you mags
yeah tape people do call me bags number
nine who keeps a clean of room both of
us yeah even minor cleanliness except
for when you stay here you leave ok
that's because I don't sleep in my room
when I come home from college I
literally sleep in Emma's room in her
bed we sleep together cuz she has a
king-size bed so instead of sleeping in
my own room or with myself I always
sleep with her and I'll like leave my
stuff everywhere who reads more number
11 what is something you like to do
together exactly will we ever yeah
everything number thirteen who is the
most talented it depends on what we both
have different talents in different ways
so we're not gonna go into detail
because each of us are special in our
own ways we're both two completely
different people and yeah
fourteen what is your favorite makeup
beauty product slash brand so your
favorite product and then your favorite
brand favorite product oh I know what
mine is yeah bronzer cuz I the hoola
which one a two-piece one really yeah
I'm over that one because the hoola one
isn't as pigmented oh oh my makeup brand
is Venki beauties my favorite thing

favorite product just probably oh I had
like a couple so I have my L'Oreal

love their foundation oh my god it just
literally feels like you have nothing on
your face and then I also like the match
sticks and also I got this new Too Faced
highlighter

my favorite brand I probably like Fendi
the most right now or I want to like do
these two things that I like one of my
favorites number 15
what is your sister really bad at
singing yeah you're good really I mean
you're not bad at singing but it's just
not something where you'd like belt out
song and I'd be like oh my god like
you're amazing number 16 what is the
best thing about one another I just
think that like we're so close and we
get along so well we really agree on it
we can come to each other with again
yeah we can come to each other with
anything especially because like just
having your sister be your best friend
and honestly the best thing ever because
you can complain to them all day and
it's not like they're just gonna be like
okay
oh you're annoying like I'm not gonna be
a friend anymore like you
our friends through literally every
number 17 who takes longer to get ready
I feel like I do you do I'm gonna say
that it definitely gets takes longer to
get ready heels or flats I would
probably say honestly it really depends
on the day and like the vet goes fit but
usually like our go two's flat sneakers
yeah got I got those flats sneakers of
the deenis those are probably our
favorite what was the last thing that
you talked about like what last time you
just we just talked to over it before
you started filming us when we were
aging oh are you close no is that even a
question
number 21 what is one thing that you can
do that your sister can't I know what I
can do that you can't do okay and I know
one thing that you can do but I can't do
so I kind of you just said maybe I'll
just answer this one but one thing that
I can do that Emma can't is I can say
that off of the backwards I don't know
why I can do this honestly one day when
I was younger it just kind of came to me
and I was at my great grandma's 80th
birthday party weird I know and I was
like wait guys like I could
after the backwards and they were all
just like are you serious let's do it so
I literally said it zy x WT sr q bo what
I'd like a gif ECB I like I can do it so
fast you can do it slow whatever I don't
know why I can do it but I can do it and
I know that I'm a can okay and you can
also Amazon every person that she can
take a selfie like you know those girls
I can just wear no makeup and like whip
out their full intake yourself you'd be
like like that's you and that's so not
me if I tried to do that people would be
like are you that's just one thing that
I do don't think I need any screenshot
of it one more you were like this I'm
sticking out your tongue and if I ever
took that it would be like are you
serious oh I'm serious
Oh number 22 what is a weird habit of
your system I know yours yeah I know
your weird habit in my head
probably this thinking about you is that
every single morning like during the
summer and whenever we're hanging out
together Emma will go into our cabinet
and she'll get the biggest mason jar
that we have at home it's like for this
thing or marketing she'll fill the whole
thing up with ice and put water in it in
a straw and it's always a green straw
and then she'll sit at our kitchen table
in the head drink this ice water every
day and for some reason I don't like ice
water I drink wireless thing I write
using that you do is you drew water
without ice yeah but it just does a
grass it's come from the fridge already
yeah but you can just grab the cups put
water and I know I don't know because I
don't have Levi's because it's just
plain bad
I know number 23 what was your biggest
fight or argument we fight I don't like
why you asking me what to wear and I'm
like I don't know and then you're like
okay and I'm just like yeah by like but
we don't really know we're 24 describe
the last thing that you did with your
sister
that's so sad because the last thing
that we did we got all ready to go on to
breakfast
yeah and like we had this whole day
planned like we're gonna do all this
stuff and then our dad was really mean
to us so we turned around a game you
know we didn't go number 25 the final
question is complete this statement and
you have to convene all this
