today's video is the long-awaited Italy
haul I'm gonna be showing you guys
everything and that I got when I was on
my trip in Italy and I will have all of
these items linked down below for you I
some of them are a bit high-end which is
not for everybody I understand that
everybody has like their own different
styles but I did pick up a few items
that were high-end so if you're not into
that and everything like that that's
completely fine I will have something
that is very similar to what I got
linked down below as well so you guys
can get the look for less and yeah other
than that everything else I will have a
link down below for you guys I know that
you guys have been super excited to see
this video and I'm so excited to finally
share it with you guys so without
further ado let's get started okay so
starting off I'm gonna start off with
actually all sort of the accessories
that I got so the first thing that I got
was when I was in Venice yeah we got
these when we were in Venice and I got
this necklace and it is just this gold
kind of like beaded necklace and it is
real gold and the reason why it like
looks sparkly like that is because the
gold is raw cut which i think is
absolutely gorgeous and this is the
bracelet it came with a matching
bracelet as well
the lady who was selling it to us was
like oh my god like if you love the
necklace like you're gonna the bracelet
I was like okay like let me see the
bracelet and so I ended up getting both
the necklace and the bracelet the
necklace and the bracelet so I ended up
getting both the necklace and the
bracelet and I just think that they're
absolutely gorgeous and since they are
real gold I can wear them like 24/7
eight don't have to worry about taking
it off when I'm on a beach I don't have
to worry about taking it off in the
shower it's just like I can wear it all
the time which I really like because
personally I would rather have the
quality over quantity I'd rather wear
one really nice necklace and bracelet
every single day then have a bunch of
ones that like aren't as good quality
that I have to make sure I'm always
taking off and like
not getting ruined because they were
less expensive but I will have a
necklace and bracelet that look just
like this link to down below for you
guys
Oh in the store that we got them from I
have the little card right here I can
read off to you where it's from
okay so this is where the necklace and
bracelet are from it is from a store
called Camilla Jew I'm not even to try
to print out that I'm just going to show
you guys so this is where the bracelet
and necklace are from and it is in st.
Mark's Square in Venice and the next
thing I also got when I was in Venice we
were actually on an island called bur on
no island and it is this little island
that has a bunch of different colored
houses and you guys would have seen in
the vlogs from that day but I just got
this bag right here and it's handmade
and I think it's absolutely gorgeous it
has a gold chain strap which you can use
as a crossbody like this or you can also
use it on one shoulder like that and
then this right here is just an extra
detail that you can use to like hold it
with your hand but this is ox that's
what the lady told me and it's just this
crocheted red bag with a linen interior
and I just thought that this bag was
absolutely gorgeous and I love the
detailing on the front how it's kind of
like bumpy as you can see and then
that's just what it looks like I don't
know I just really liked it and wanted
to be able to like have something from
Italy that was handmade and that I could
always like have forever and it would
remind me of my trip so I decided to get
that bag I really really like it and the
next thing that I got is something that
I literally have been looking for for
the longest time because it sold out in
the United States like it's so hard to
get you can never get them and actually
over the winter I ordered this online I
think it was in November and they were
like yeah it's on a backorder for three
months like you will probably get it in
February so I was like okay like that's
such a long time but like I'll wait it's
not that big of a deal like I don't need
right now and so in December I ended up
losing my debit card and so when I lost
my card I obviously cancelled it and got
a new one but when I cancelled it I
completely forgot that I already placed
an order at the store and the item
couldn't get shipped to me because my
credit card couldn't get charged
sentence I cancelled it because it got
lost so anyway I finally got the belt
that I wanted and it is from Gucci it is
just the black leather belt with the GG
G buckle and this is the biggest one
that you can get I used to have a
smaller one but I just felt like it was
hard to wear it with certain things I
didn't really like the size but I looked
at it online I bought it online and I
didn't realize how small it was when I
got it in so I ended up selling that one
on Poshmark
and then I got this one which I love and
I got a size 80 and I usually wear a
size 26 or 27 in jeans just to give you
guys a reference so I'm really happy
with this it was so much easier to get
when I was in Italy because Gucci is
like founded in Florence so they have
like everything like every size every
item available at all times which was
really nice oh and also something that
is interesting is that when you shop in
Europe there tax it's like you don't
have to be tax on the item so you just
buy an item at whatever store you go to
and then when you go to the airport you
go to the tax return office and then
they'll end up refunding your card with
however much tax you paid on that item
so if you're ever planning to buy
anything that's like expensive or
high-end I definitely recommend doing it
when you are in a different country if
you go abroad and stuff but definitely
check like the currencies and everything
just to make sure that you are saving
money and not losing money and so the
next item that I got this is my last
yeah this is like the last high-end item
that I got from Italy and it is from
Saint Laurent and I got this little
black bag and this is just what it looks
like it has a gold strap that is
crossbody so it just looks like this and
you can like double it over and then
wear it as a shoulder
you can tuck it in and where does the
clutch you can do basically anything and
what I really liked about this bag is
that the inside kind of looks like a
wallet so there are places for your
cards back here and then this is a
zipper pocket for cash and stuff just
because when I go out to the bar with my
friends I hate having to bring like my
phone my wallet my chapstick like
everything and have to worry about like
carrying each individual item so this is
nice because I can literally literally
fit my phone right in here my cards in
here cash in here my ID chapstick
everything like this is just the most
perfect evening bag and I just realized
that I'm gonna have it forever and just
like I said in the beginning of the
video I'm more like a quality over
quantity type person so I'd rather get
like one really nice item then a bunch
of ones that I know like aren't gonna be
as good quality and like could fall
apart and stuff like that so I thought
is why I got this little bag I'm so
happy with it I don't know I just like
really love it so much okay now moving
on into all of the clothing items that I
got the first thing I picked up was from
Zara and they are these sneakers right
here and they're super platform and
they're just a neutral colored I wore
these in an Instagram post and then
after that everyone started making fun
of me like on our tour everyone was like
oh my god like look at your shape ups
like you're wearing shape ups and I was
like honestly they were really cute when
I tried them on in the dressing room at
Zara so these are the sneakers that I
got and they look really cute with the
next dress that I'm gonna be showing you
guys that you guys were obsessing over
in my Instagram and I don't know if we
have it in the Zara in the states just
because I know that everything is
different if you go to Europe versus buy
here but this is the dress and it's just
that white babydoll dress I was wearing
and my Instagram pictures and it ties on
the front and it's super cute and the
thing that I love about it is has
built-in shorts underneath and all
insert a picture right here of every
single item for one award on the trip
just to make it easier for you guys to
see like what it looks like and I got
this dress in a size small but again
like I was saying it looks so cute with
these sneakers just because I love the
babydoll fit it's very short but it I
don't know it just like isn't too short
and looks really classy and I just think
about it's a bear
very flattering dress especially being
in Italy like eating 24/7 this was
definitely one of my favorite things to
wear and the next thing I got from Zara
is one of my other favorites and this is
in a size small I just got this taupe
colored skirt and it's super high
waisted and it has a little drawstring
waistband and then it's long and just
ruffles at the end I just thought that
this was so classy to wear with like
either white bodysuit or a cropped shirt
whatever you prefer whatever you feel
comfortable with it would look cute with
anything white I just think that this
color really complements like skin tones
during the summer stuff that it was very
beautiful and very Italy and the next
thing I got from Zara is a pair of jeans
and they are just these high-waisted
jeans with some rips on the leg and then
the bottoms are just raw cut and
distressed they literally are just plain
mom jeans that are high-waisted I got
them in a size uf6 and I feel like when
I go to Zara their sizing is so weird
and pants like I don't know how I feel
about these pants because they're kind
of big on me but like I I don't really
know I don't know how much I like them
just because I don't personally like the
way that their jeans fit me but in the
moment I liked them I liked wearing like
my Gucci boat with them and wore them
with a little orange top from revolve
I'll insert the photo from when I was
out the trophy found it I wore them but
I don't know how I really feel about
Zara jeans I've always felt that way so
I don't really know why I bought those
but we will see if they end up working
out and next I got a pair of high rate
short-term Zara and these ones I really
like they are distressed and highly sit
and then this is just what they look
like on the back and I like them because
they are super high waisted on me and
they're also not short the one thing
that I feel happens when I put on
high-rise shorts is that they are way
too short for me and they end up like
showing my butt and I'm just like I'm
comfortable walking around in them and
they just like don't look flattering or
classy so I wanted to pair up like
longer classy high-rise short so I got
these ones from Zara and they're in
these tights uf6
as well and that's just what they look
like and I know I'm going to be getting
a ton of yourself as on this summer just
because I really don't have
many pairs some denim shorts and the
next thing I got from sorry you guys
were also loving on my Instagram and
it's this orange romper with this ruffle
detailing down the sleeves and then it's
just v-neck and then the little shorts
on the bottom and this romper so cute I
love the color it's so flattering I just
think that the way that it fits it fits
really nicely I got it in a size small
by the way and I don't know I just like
really like the way that it looks like
the video on the front and then the
ruffles you chilling on the sleeves I
think is gorgeous and also one thing
about this romper is that I need to see
if it this happens like after I wash it
but it was super and she liked walking
around in it not gonna lie so that was
like my one thing I didn't like about it
but other than that I thought that it
was so cute and honestly like I loved it
so much that I didn't really care about
how itchy it was it looked so good and
yeah I just really really like this and
that's and it's by their brand the TRF
collection just if you guys are
wondering and next from Zara
I got this white shirt and it's just V
in the front and then I was like a baby
doll bottom and then this is what the
back looks like it just has this
detailing where you can tie these little
ties together and then the sleeves just
have little ruffles on the side I
thought this was so cute and so classy
and flattering because I need it to find
like more clothes to wear when I'm
around adults and like in situations
where like I'm not with my friends like
I can't just always wear high-waisted
jeans and like a crop top and stuff like
that like I wanted to get more like
classy items so I can wear them like in
public stuff like that so I picked up
that shot I really really like I know it
comes in a bunch of different other
colors as well and I also got it in a
size small okay and the last item from
Zara I'm absolutely obsessed with this
is it is this crocheted shirt with these
little tassels on the bottom and this is
so cute I definitely think that you
should wear a bra light under it just
because it shows kind of on the sides it
gives you like a little side boob and I
don't know I just feel like for me at
least like I would rather wear a bra
light under it also because it's kind of
shear and see-through it has like some
holes and then this is what the back
looks like
I just got this and they say small I
think that it would look so cute this
summer with like a pair of mom jeans and
a pair of shorts or like cute sandals
you can literally wear it with anything
denim I just think that it would look
really really nice if it just because of
like the cream color mixed with the blue
with your denim I just think that that
is a super cute look especially for
summer okay and moving on to items that
are not from Zara because I literally
went in it at Zara I was so obsessed
with the Europeans are it's completely
different than the ones here you usually
want to go twos are in Boston like
nothing fits me right and I don't know I
just can never find anything that I like
so I saw like everything I liked there
and I got obsessed and I had to get it
all so we're all the Mazzara next I got
this bathing suit from a random store
actually on the street it was really
affordable and it's called tezi nice t
eazy-e and is i don't really know how to
pronounce that everybody's like that you
can not pronounce any Italian words like
just stop trying so I'm not even shy but
these are the bottoms and they are just
these cheeky white bottoms and the
material is ribbed and it just has that
detailing and so those are just plain
white but the top was my favorite of all
time this is what it looks like it just
has this little V in the front and then
it just has two straps and then it ties
and the back which I thought was such a
cute detail and I'm really excited to
wear this bathing suit this summer
honestly I think that it was like twenty
dollars for the top and bottom together
so we'll have it link down below for you
guys but you need to get it I know it
comes in black and bread also I really
wish I got the other colors because it's
so cute but I just got one because we
were gonna go to an island where we
needed a bathing suit and then Gretchen
and I ended up not going so I just had
over in a bathing suit with me and I'm
actually really glad that I bought it
because it's so cute I cannot wait to
wear it oh my god this next thing I'm so
obsessed with I got this denim jacket
and it's by the brand Strada
Stradivarius I really don't know how to
pronounce that either but I'll have a
link down below and this is just what it
looks like it's just a plain denim
jacket and it's a stretch
which I really like because usually when
I have denim jackets they're really
stiff and I don't like them like I used
to have one from j.crew and it was just
too like uncomfortable for me but this
one is so comfortable and I actually
sized up and got it in a medium and
which it was literally the best choice
ever like it's so easy to wear you can
like throw it over your shoulders if you
want like a look like that or you can
like wear it normally you can wear it
with a dress you can wear with like
joggers and tank top literally anything
I think it's the most perfect film
jacket I know I'm gonna be getting so
much use out of it and also it was not
expensive at all it was actually very
affordable I really liked the store that
I got that jacket from um and it's
getting a lot of other stuff from there
too like this just right here the next
item I got is this dress from the same
store as my denim jacket and I wore this
when I went to Vatican City just because
it covered my shoulders and my knees and
I know I didn't have anything like that
on the trip so I got it in a size small
and it's just this striped midi dress
and it has V in the front and then it
just buttons all the way down and has
that nice detailing in this just navy
blue and white striped and I've never
like owned a dress like this but
honestly it was very flattering like it
really fit you like in the waist area
and then it flowed out and they see and
I just thought that it was a perfect
thing to wear to Vatican City just
because when you go there you do have to
have your shoulders and your knees
covered just out of respect it's like
one of their rules that they have so
what this dress was absolutely perfect
for that
and the next thing that Gretchen and I
got we actually got the same item from
that same store and we got these
t-shirts and they say sister season on
them and both of us were like wait why
did we get that like after we got them
we were like oh my god let's just get
them goods but her and I call each other
sitting like hey sit cinch Mike hey it's
like what's up so we got these shirts I
say sister season and they were really
inexpensive and we were just like you
know what whatever let's get them like
they're cute and honestly I'll probably
wear it with a pair of like Greg Brady
mumbles joggers like when I'm running to
get a coffee like with my hair in a bun
and some sunglasses this summer I just
think it's really funny Oh
I don't know and now like I'll be able
to have any be like scratch in like hey
sis
so we got these I don't think I would
ever wear this like normally during the
day but definitely with joggers it'll
look really cute and last but not least
this is my absolute favorite item that I
got from the same store that I just got
those previous items from I can't even
like pronounce it for you guys but I
know that it's a Spanish boutique that's
I think somebody DMT man Instagram was
like actually that's not Italian that's
actually from Spain so thank you to
whoever deemed me and told me I didn't
know that but this is de Maxie or MIDI
dress that I got it's just this oatmeal
colored very casual soft cotton mini
dress with a ribbed detailing and then
it just goes down all the way to the
bottom and stops right about at your
calf line and this dress was super
flattering I wore it one of the days
just with my hair down in the middle
part and some Ravens the hexagon ones
with the gold around the edges I'll also
have those things down below just
because a lot of you guys were asking me
about them and this was super cute I
just literally wore it with a pair of
slides paired it with a bag and wore my
gold jewelry and there you have that you
have a perfect outfit you look so cute
and so put together but you're also very
comfortable at the same time so many
dresses have been my obsession lately
and last but not least I got an item
from brandy melville you guys are gonna
be like Maggie why would you go to
Europe and buy something from brandy
melville but they actually are different
over there and I've never seen this
shirt before but correct me if I'm wrong
I got this t-shirt it just says New York
on it and it's just a cropped upgrade
tee and it's kind of like tight on your
shoulders and like boob area and then it
gets looser at the bottom which I really
liked because emma has the Colorado
cropped t-shirt from brandy melville and
that one's more like loose fitted and I
just liked how this one was fitted to
your body and I love Gregg you guys know
you can never go wrong with a comfy gray
and this is like my favorite shirt to
wear with like joggers and slides or
joggers and nmds I've been wearing this
a ton recently and I don't know I just
can't wait till I like wash it a bunch
and it gets really just stressed in worn
in I feel like that's my favorite with
like a comfy gray t-shirt okay so that
