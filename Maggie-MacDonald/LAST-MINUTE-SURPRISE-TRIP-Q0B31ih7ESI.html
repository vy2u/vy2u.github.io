February first and I just got all ready
it's like 8 o'clock I need to go get a
coffee and then get out of here because
I'm going on a little last-minute
surprise trip and if you guys follow me
on snapchat you probably know where I'm
already going but I'm going to Minnesota
and I'm going to the Superbowl because
the Patriots are in the Superbowl and
like I'll go into detail about what I'm
gonna be doing there a little bit later
so like I'm just getting ready now and
you need to go get a coffee before I
leave to go to the airport I just wanted
to show you guys like my outfit and
stuff what I'm wearing I have on this
little cream beanie from Madewell
just because it's gonna be so cold there
it's like negative degrees right now and
I'm wearing it with black lines my short
either these are actually the mini uggs
and not the short ones I just like them
a lot better because they're like ankle
and I have like bigger like muscular
thighs so when I wear the mini ones
compared to the ankle ones they just
look so much better on me and I'm also
wearing this little top that I just got
from Lululemon it just ties in the front
like that with a Lululemon sports bra
and my Scorpio necklace Oh a lot of
people ask me have been asking me where
it's from and I got it off of Etsy it is
real gold so I just typed in like 14
karat gold personalized necklace and I
picked whatever one came up so if you
guys want to do the same that's what I
did
so I'm gonna go get a coffee now I'm all
packed up I need to close my suitcase I
have my carry-on bag ready and I'm just
waiting for the car to pick me up and
then I'm gonna head out oh my god guys I
just got this from CVS yesterday and it
is the to cover mint Burt's Bees I like
can't talk today but it's a cucumber
mint Burt's Bees and it's so good so I
have the cucumber mint in the strawberry
one which are my favorites so I'm gonna
bring those with me and let's go
I feel like I was just at the airport
yesterday I know because I was here last
week I know it's weird because when I
went to my psychic reading a couple of
weeks ago she was like you're gonna be
doing a lot of traveling this year and I
was just like really and now I think of
it I went to California I'm going to
Minnesota and I'm going to spring break
and then I also have
but I'm excited I'm glad I brought this
hat with me though because I didn't
really I like was thinking about it it's
different yeah it's so cold there so it
was different packing to go here than
California is Mike worried about not
gonna be able to I was walking through
the airport and these things literally
remind me of Kaylee
like her boyfriend goes to the store and
we'll get her a little stuffed animal
every single time well actually not
little it's like they like the size of
that dog right there but she has one
like this and its name is Jeffery and it
reminds me of it
they're so cute so finally we're at our
date right now and I had to eat
something cuz I'm really really hungry
and it is movie because it's such an
awkward time like at 8:00 breakfast this
morning at 7:30 and now it's like almost
11:00 and I'm hungry but like by the
time you get there what time will it be
when we get there the time goes back
through it'll be like 1 something to
something well just work as the time
goes back because there's time change
but as easy and there was like nothing
to eat like our gate
and so I can't peanut butter they didn't
have to start about other rooms at yeah
oh and after oh so there's no natural
lighting right but like that you can't
even see me but I'm worth right now with
it for something to do it's just like I
don't know yeah it's really gonna like
it
I don't know about you but bagels with
peanut butters literally my favorite
like this is gonna be so bomb right now
doesn't any look that good but I'm like
so said je dis I love bagels so I was
getting on the plane
and I get up the line think that there
was no line we're kidding because I get
out there and I was like where's the
boarding pass I don't know where it is
so I went to my pocket it wasn't in my
pocket where I left it and then left me
the girl
took my ID and she was like oh I can't
just like pretty odd anyone so I was
just like thank you because I had no
idea where I put it and I lost it maybe
it like fell out of my pocket when I was
like taking off my jacket because I
whipped off my jacket I was taking a
bunch of pictures when we were waiting
so maybe it's in there but I don't know
she was like you're literally gonna find
it at the last second like when you like
don't expect you I think you'll find it
like once you got on the plane it was
just like yeah you're right but we're
getting on right now and I don't think
I'm sitting next to my mom on the plane
which has been sad maybe we'll be near
each other where we can switch so I can
sit next yeah what row are you 26 look
they have free Wi-Fi that was one thing
that I was talking about how I didn't
like how American Airlines didn't have
free Wi-Fi like they had cool TVs and
stuff but it was like 16 dollars for
Wi-Fi I love JetBlue because it's always
free so I didn't I don't think I have
logged after like we were on the plane
but we finally made it we had like this
big long PSEO of us going to all these
different hotels and a part over when
first went to the first hotel it was 25
minutes away and then we went to another
one that was like a mile down the road
