today's video I just wanted to show you
some of the items that I recently picked
up from the Mall of America as you guys
know I went to the Super Bowl over the
this past weekend and I just thought I'm
near the Mall of America and I've never
been it's the biggest mall in the world
so I have to buy stuff and I got a lot
of great things and I am so excited to
show you again like always I will have
all of these items linked down below for
you and without further ado what let's
get started first I'm going to start off
with what I got from PacSun and the
first thing I got is just this amazing
red bodysuit that is adidas and it has
these three strengths down the front and
I thought that this was so cool when I
saw it I was like oh my god first of all
it's red you guys know I love bread and
second like this is amazing and I can't
wait to wear it with a pair of joggers
and I just think that it's super cool
like if I had a really nice tan and like
wearing like big sunglasses like I just
think that it would look super bougie
and I really liked it a lot and I got
this in a size small it fits really well
I love the material it's so soft and so
stretchy and I was so excited when I saw
this I was like you know what this is so
me I need to get it then I got a few of
the items from the brandy section
because I feel like when I look online
they don't have the same stuff as they
have in store because I look all the
time to see if they have like cropped
tank tops and stuff like that and they
never do but I was lucky enough to get
this white when I know that Kaylee just
got it a few weeks ago so I was like you
know what I'm copying you because that
tank top is so soft I love all the
brandy tank tops and I need a good white
cropped tank top so I got this one and
then I also have to pick it up of course
if I was getting the white one I need to
get black as well so I just got it in
black and they're so soft and they have
really skinny spaghetti straps which I
love they're just really dainty and I
wear these all the time so I was like
you know what I'm just gonna get both of
them I know I'm gonna get so much use
out of them so I'm so excited that I
picked those up then I got a pair of
Brandis sweatpants and these are
actually the john galt brand it's not
the brandy burn but it's like the one
that is sold there if you guys shop
there you will know what I'm saying
but they are just
this really soft gray pair of joggers
and I already have a pair from Brandi
but their drawstring and these ones
aren't drawstring which I really liked
and they're really high waisted and
they're really soft on the inside
and I wear joggers constantly I'm always
wearing them to class always throwing
them on like to go run around and do
stuff so what I just thought you could
never have too many pairs of plain and
gray comfy joggers just because I'm
always wearing them and feeling like I
need to just wash them constantly so I
was really excited to find these and
pick up another pair of them and the
next thing I picked up is yes my second
pair of jeans that I own cuz I was like
you know what I only own one pair of
jeans and they're from Abercrombie you
guys know I love their girlfriend jeans
so I saw that they had a nother like
style of the ante high race girlfriend
Jean and I was like you know what I need
to get them I picked them up any size 27
and they just have all these rips down
the front and then like this distressed
detailing at the ends which I love
they're super high waisted you guys know
I love that as well and then the back
just looks like that I thought that it
was kind of cool in different now it
didn't have a patch and it just had like
that blue area on the back I don't know
I just thought that was so fun but I
needed another pair of jeans and these
ones were 50% off so I was like you know
what I'm gonna get them because I know I
already love my other Abercrombie jeans
so these ones I know are gonna fit just
like that and I know that they have the
right amount of distressing on them and
they honestly just give you that great
like girlfriend just rust bag you look
that you're looking for without being
like too baggy if you know what I mean
then I picked up some items from
Nordstrom and these are all from Topshop
and I got these high-rise mom jeans and
they're very very distressed on the
bottom which I loved these are a size
us6
I feel like top shops runs really really
small and I know shorts always fit me so
weird because like my thighs and my butt
are like bigger and more muscular so I
got these and they fit really well
they're superhighway said and they
really like suck everything in and I'm
so excited to wear these when I go to
Miami and then I picked up this amazing
bodysuit from Topshop I got this in a
size 6 as well and it is just this
bronze colored bodysuit and look at the
back it's completely open and then it
just goes straight across in the back
like that and I don't know where I'm
gonna wear this yet but I will find a
place to wear it and it's gonna be so
cute I just love the color I thought
that it was so different I love how it's
completely open in the back and I love
wearing fun body suits and stuff like
that so I was super excited when I got
this it's so so so cute and as if I
didn't need another leather jacket I got
this one from Topshop and I really liked
it because I had like this just just
detailing on it like different color and
that I really really really like this
little buckle that it has on the sleeve
there and I picked this up in a size 4
and I wore it on Saturday night and it
was so cute I absolutely love it I'm
obsessed and I know I'm gonna be getting
a ton use out of it I love like wearing
cool jackets and pairing them with
really basic items like a plain bodysuit
and like a pair of jeans or even like
leggings and a crop top so I know I'm
gonna be getting a ton of use out of
this and last but not least I totally
didn't even need these at all but I
picked up another pair of shoes I have a
sneaker obsession you guys I'm obsessed
with the Adidas sneakers and I own the
Stan Smith's in two pairs of X cos
Elle's so I got a pair of the campus
sneakers and they're just in this red
color I have red gazelles but they're
like a dark red and these were really
cool because they were like right and
like fiery I don't know I love them so I
was like you know what I'm gonna get
them because I know I'm gonna wear them
a ton I always am wearing sneakers and I
just thought that they were super cute
and they fit really well they're way
more comfortable than the gazelles so I
know I'm probably gonna end up like
getting rid of my other red gazelles
that I have and just wearing these
because I love the color so much better
and they fit so much better and if you
guys are looking for a comfy pair of
sneakers you need me me me need I cannot
stress it enough you need to get adidas
campuses because they're so comfortable
I'm literally gonna get them in like a
bunch of different colors now just
because of how comfy they are so that
