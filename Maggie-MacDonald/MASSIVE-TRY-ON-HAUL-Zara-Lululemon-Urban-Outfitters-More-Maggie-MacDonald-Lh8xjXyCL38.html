today's video I'm going to be doing a
giant haul with things that I bought
from the Nordstrom sale Zara Lululemon
anthropology made well there are so many
things that I bought and I'm so excited
to share them with you all so without
further ado let's get started so first I
want to show you guys all the items that
I got from the Nordstrom sale first I
got this t-shirt from sincerely Jules
I've got it in a size small it just is a
plain grey t-shirt with black writing on
it that says something in French I don't
know how to pronounce it I'm not even
gonna try because I'm gonna sound so
stupid but I love this shirt so much I
just think that it's so cute to throw on
with a pair boyfriend jeans or
high-waisted shorts and just be super
comfy but it also makes your outfit look
extremely cute as well and next I got a
pair of sandals from Chinese Laundry I
got these in a size eight and a half and
they are just these brown strappy
sandals with this thing that goes strap
that goes right around your ankle they
just look like that and I think that
these are a nice thing to have in your
closet just a neutral pair of sandals
that you can throw on and wear with any
outfit I really like these especially if
I'm gonna be wearing a pair of boyfriend
jeans or just something that's super
casual these are really nice to have to
just throw on and you can wear them
anywhere they will go with anything next
I bought a pair of heels from a wild
vivo lounge they are also a size eight
and a half and they are just use tan
heels with this big chunky block heel
and then this strap that goes over the
front like that and then they also have
an ankle strap I'm sure most of you guys
have seen these everywhere they are
super popular right now when they are my
go-to look if I want to wear heels I
love these I feel like these look the
best on me I think these are the most
comfortable I have them in a bunch of
different color so I thought might as
well add a pair of neutral ones to my
wardrobe and next I just got a layered
necklace from Melrose and Market just
looks like this and it has
stone on the first layer and then it
goes down it has a gold bar with two old
circles on it I love this necklace I
think that it's perfect for when you're
wearing a shirt like this that's low-cut
just to have something a little bit
extra to add to your outfit it was not
expensive at all I think it was around
eight dollars so I really like this and
I think that this is going to be a
staple piece in my closet for the next
couple of months next from the Nordstrom
sale I've just got a few of these hair
ties I gonna pack up like the most
neutral colors I love these because they
don't crease my hair because my hair so
find that if I do put it up in a
ponytail or a bun with a regular hair
elastic it will leave a crease so these
are must-haves me I always wear them on
my wrist I always have them at all times
so I just thought that I should get
another pack when they were really cheap
I think they were only around like five
dollars or something so I just threw
these in my shopping cart these are
always nice to have when you're
traveling on the go and things like that
I also got two other things from Lerna
words from sale one of them I had to
return it was Sam Edelman laya sneakers
with the pom-poms on the top I got them
in white and I got a size eight and a
half which is what I usually wear and
they came in the mail and they were
extremely big on me so I returned to
those and I think I'm gonna order a pair
of mine in this size 8 and I think I'm
gonna go down a size I also got a shirt
from chaser I can try to insert a
picture right here but it's just a
t-shirt that says tequila tacos and naps
and it's in bread writing it's a white
t-shirt I got that in a size small it
should come in by Friday I think but I'm
super excited to get that again I just
wanted to get a few graphic tees so I
can wear them with like boyfriend jeans
and pair of shorts and just throw them
on and look really cute without
basically having to try at all and next
I got some items from made well to start
off I've got this
gray racerback tank top in a size extra
small it's just this ribbed plain super
comfy tank top I'm excited to wear this
with some jeans and shorts and throw on
like a layered necklace again my go-to
look is just anything super comfortable
and effortless I don't really like to
dress up that much I like to wear a lot
of neutral pieces and then like put
things together with accessories to
really make them look cute and I like to
have a lot of items in my closet that
are staple items so this will be perfect
I can wear it so many different ways so
many different times so I'm really
excited that I got that I also got the
boyfriend jeans that I'm wearing right
now
they are just this blue jean they are
super high-waisted they fit perfectly
they look good on your bus they suck
everything in I tried them on in the
store usually it made well I'm a size 26
and they're jeans but these I have to
size up and get a size 27 so they can
fit my legs my butt but they are the
most amazing jeans ever I highly
recommend them they are actually called
the I think the perfect summer jeans
which they're not even lying they are
the perfect summer Jean if you follow me
on instagram you'll see that I wore
these a ton over the weekend I literally
haven't been able to stop wearing them
since I got them and next I just got a
few jewelry pieces from me lo I got this
spring that I'm wearing right here it's
just a circle gold ring and then I just
got these stackable rings as well it
came with five different rings just this
black one that has some black
rhinestones and this one right here has
some white rhinestones and then to hold
bands and a silver band
so I got these rings which I love they
were really inexpensive I think both of
them were around $30 I would say but I
definitely would not recommend wearing
these when you wash your hands I think
that it will tarnish them and kind of
take the gold off I am pretty sure that
they're not real gold I also got a pair
of earrings from me well I got these
little gold circles right here I just
softened up in my second hole in both my
ears and I love them they are so plain
they're really trendy right now kind of
I really AM into the look of like dainty
gold jewelry so I'm really happy that I
found those I was looking online
everywhere for like the perfect pair of
earrings that would go good next to
pearls that I'm wearing and I just
wanted something really small and gold
so I love those a lot I'm so happy that
I found those and next I got something
from Anthropologie just this necklace
that I'm wearing right now see it's just
this small E and it's gold and it has a
little diamond next to it
it's really dainty and cute and the e
actually stands for Emma my sister's
name so that's why I wear this necklace
on my neck she has an M and I have an e
next
I just got a few pieces from Zara and
the first one are these black
high-waisted pants and they have this
big tie in the front they are kind of
cropped around your ankle and they're
just these vertical black and white
striped pants it's a really lightweight
material which I like and these I
actually got in a size medium I tried
them on in a bunch of different sizes
Zara sizing is really weird on me so I
definitely recommend going into the
dressing room and trying their stuff on
before you order it because I know that
they tend to run really really weird but
I'm super excited to wear these pants I
just think that they're so fun they
remind me of Kourtney Kardashian so yeah
I'm so excited to wear these and then
from Zara I just got this black and
white
polkadot shirt with these bell sleeves
and it just buttons up the front and
ties it kind of has a little ruffle
around the neck and I got this in a size
small it is just from these are a basic
collection as well as the striped pants
that I got it I also got a few items for
Lululemon first I got this white sports
bra it's just super v in the front it
runs really really low and it has this
thick band which goes around your chest
area and I really like that because it's
long and it just sucks everything in and
in the back
it's just crisscross like that and it
has a little cutout I love this I can
get so cute to wear with a pair of high
waisted leggings next I got these
joggers and they're in this really
lightweight material like this and
they're just tight around the ankle and
they tie the drawstring I got them any
size six but usually in Lululemon I'm a
size four I did size up in these they
were a bit tight when I tried on before
so I did end up getting a six in the
pants next I got this black cropped tank
top from Lululemon and it just has this
little tie in the front I got this in a
size two and I'm so excited to wear this
just when I work out a pair of leggings
and sneakers and last but not least I
got this white bomber jacket from
Lululemon and I got this any size six as
well the bomber jacket and the joggers
are in the same material it's like this
new material I don't know if you can see
it on the camera it's really thin and
lightweight and it's kind of like a suit
was she almost I'm so excited to wear
this jacket during the spring and fall
it's just lightweight I always wear
legging himself to class so I think this
will be really nice to wear and set it
just throwing out a sweatshirt I have
something that's like more cute now and
last but not least I just got this tank
top that I'm wearing from Urban
Outfitters the brand is silence and
noise and it is a size small it's just
this orange spaghetti strap
top and it's kind of cropped it has a
little ruffle in the front and then it
opened back and this looks so cute with
boyfriend jeans or anything that's
high-waisted and I love this color right
now if you can't tell it nails already
this orange color is my absolute
favorite right now I love it I think
it's so cute for the summer and I am so
excited that I found a piece like this
