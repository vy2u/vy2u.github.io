channel today's video as you can see by
the title I am showing you my morning
routine and as you can see I'm just
filling up this big Starbucks cup with
water and then I am going to go into my
room and start getting ready for the day
so the first thing I do when I wake up
in the morning is I always always always
make my bed and before I get into the
shower I am just going to go into my
closet and start picking out the outfit
that I'm gonna wear for the day just so
everything's laid out before I actually
take a shower then these are all of the
products that I use when I'm in the
shower it's pretty self-explanatory but
I will have them all linked down below
and then these are the products that I
use when I brush my teeth I use these
every single day they're my absolute
favorite this is my skincare routine I'm
going to use this Kensington apothecary
toner and just rub that all over my face
with a cotton pad when I get out of the
shower in my face is completely cleaned
and dried then I'm gonna be going in
with the Kensington apothecary skin
serum and I always put this on after I
put on my toner it's just gonna help
brighten your face and get rid of all
the imperfections something else that
you do every single day after I take a
shower is I use my favorite Pantene
detangler spray and I just spray that
all over my wet hair and then I'm gonna
go in using my wet brush and then brush
out all of the knots and stuff from when
I was sleeping and I like using a wet
brush rather than another brush because
it's just very gentle on my hair I have
really really really fine hair so I just
feel like this one works the best for me
then I'm gonna be using an oil-free
moisturizer because I do have eyelash
extension I can't even speak right now I
have eyelash extension so I can't use
any products that have oil in them
and then I'm just gonna be putting some
aquaphor on my lips before I start doing
my makeup and these are the sentence
that I'm using right now just my
deodorant and my favorite perfume and
going on into my everyday makeup routine
I start off by using the fenty Beauty
primer and I'm just gonna shake that up
and then use about a pea-sized on my
hand and rub it into my face really well
just to prime my face and make sure that
my foundation is gonna stay and last all
day then I'm gonna be going in with my
funky Beauty Foundation and it's very
important to shake it up before you use
it just because it gets all of these
settled products all back together and
then I'm just gonna dab that on my hand
and put little dots all over my face
before going in with my Beauty Blender
and blending it all in
then I'm gonna be using the fen TVD
matchstick and using it as my concealer
and just putting it on all of the high
points on my face my forehead my nose
chin and under my eyes and then again
just using my Real Techniques sponge to
blend all that out then I'm gonna be
using the cream contour stick just to
contour my face a little bit as you can
see I'm putting it on the bridge of my
nose my cheekbones my jawline and then
my forehead and I'm gonna be using my
Real Techniques sponge to blend that in
also I just feel like I like using a
sponge rather than a brush it's just
what works out best for me next I am
gonna be applying the fenty Beauty
setting powder on all of the places
where I applied the concealer and this
is my favorite part out of my whole
routine and that is bronzer and I'm just
gonna be bronzing my cheekbones and then
also I'm gonna be applying the bronzer
to my jaw line and down on my neck which
is very important because you don't want
your face to be a different color than
your neck then I'm gonna be using my
favorite Tarte blush and just applying
that on the apples of my cheeks not too
much I'm just trying to give myself a
little rosy glow
then I'm gonna be going in with my
favorite highlighter and applying that
to my cheekbones and my Cupid's bow and
the tip of my nose and that is my
everyday morning routine I hope you guys

routine just give this video a thumbs up

will see you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
