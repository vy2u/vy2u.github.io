morning routine for you a lot of you
guys have been requesting this so I just
thought that it would be fun to show you
guys what I do on a typical morning
during the summer like when I don't have
school and stuff it's just like relaxing
I'm moving time and today I'm going to
be like showing you guys ready do it
every single morning and then also
getting ready because I'm gonna go out
to lunch with my mom right now it's
10:30 so I'm just gonna go ahead and do
what I normally do I just got out of
shower clearly because I saw the time we
had and then do maybe like a mini little
get ready with me so I hope you guys
enjoy and if you are new to my channel
please make sure that you are subscribed
and yeah let's get started
so every single morning after I take a
shower usually I just wash my face when
I'm in the shower but I took out my face
wash I've been using just to show you
guys and I used to use the Cetaphil
gentle skin cleanser but recently I've
been using the bio clarity cucumber
green tea chamomile cleanser which comes
in like the package of skincare products
that I've been using recently just
because you guys know I've been having
some trouble with my skin and I know
that bio clarity is all natural like
there's no bad ingredients or anything
so it's like you know what maybe I
should steer away from the stuff that I
don't really know what's inside and I
can't really read the ingredients on the
back so I cleaned my skin this morning
with the cleanser I just go in with the
second product which is called treat and
it's a salicylic acid oat kernel acne
treatment gel and you guys know that
I've been having problems on the side of
my skin and it's kind of gone down a
little bit definitely from this so I
just take a little bit of the gel in a
pea-sized amount on my hand I don't
really know you guys can see that just
like that and then I'll dab it it's very
cooling I really like the way that it
feels on my skin and this is the last
products that I use it is called restore
and this one's my favorite it has flora
luxe in it which is what bio clarity is
kind of like famous for and basically
what it's supposed to do it's supposed
to help like anti-inflammatory so this
used to get really like swelled up and
inflamed and it would hurt so this helps
like reduce that and then also like even
on my skin tone just get rid of all the
redness and bring out like your natural
glow so what I do and this is actually
green and don't get scared by the green
color it like ends up being clear on
your face so I'm just gonna apply this
all over like my moisturizer and so this
is just what I've been using on my skin
recently and if you guys want to try out
these products I actually have a
discount code I will have it here on the
screen for you and you can get 50% off
your first month of bio clarity and I
know that they have two different
routines that you can purchase they have
the clear skin one which is one that I
use just it's very acne prone skin and
you guys know that I have acne on the
side of my skin or I'm like struggling
with that right now so I just used the
acne one and then they also have an
essentials one which is for clear skin
that does not have acne so you can get
either one of those this one is my
absolute favorite I just feel like it
really gets rid of the redness and
puffiness in like where my face was
hurting when I had acne so if you have
asked me definitely I highly recommend
it I just feel like these products
really helps like I make my skin a very
very glowy so if you guys want to check
them out I will have a link down below
again I also have a 50% off discount
code for you guys as well to get 50% off
your routine
so I just made as bad when I've been at
home I sleep usually in Abbas bed but I
have really been home that much just
because my other bed is out my apartment
right now which I'm gonna be varying
back but I've literally only slept here
a few times since I've been home so I
just sleep in her bed said she has a
king-size bed but I just made it just
because she's super weird about her bed
well I make my bed every morning but
like if I'm the last one to get up and
they usually it's like Maggie like you
need to make my bed but now I'm gonna
just brush my hair you guys always ask
me to do like a haircare routine and all
I do is I use shampoo and conditioner
and I use a tea tree one by Paul
Mitchell actually now I use like the
lemon sage one I think it's called but
so I just used regular shampoo get your
shirt in the shower
and then we're gonna get out I just
brush it with a wet brush and so this
one is just easier because it doesn't
rip through my hair and just like make
it so I have a lot of dead ends its goal
was like really well and that's usually
what I have like struggle with is
finding a good brush that's not gonna
like rip my hair out because I have such
fine hair and also a big tip is that I
don't use heat on my hair which is
another thing why it's so like long and
healthy because I use no heat on it I've
never like blow-dried my hair
straightened and I don't even own a
straightener so those are some tips
and one thing I do every single morning
right when I wake up as I drink one of
these big venti cups from Starbucks of
water and know I'm just gonna refill it
a little bit because obviously it's um
deep and I'm gonna refill the ice just
cuz the other ice melted but it so
important to drink water in the morning
right when you wake up because since
you're sleeping for so long your body
gets super dehydrated and right when you
wake up it's like really good for you to
just drink a full thing of water and I
love drinking water out of these
Starbucks cups just because they are
just like super easy and the reusable
which is really really good and also I
hear a part of it all is that they have
a straw so I feel like what are you
drink stuff out of this draw
it's so much easier to drink and like I
want to just like keep drinking it so I
feel like when I drink water out of this
it's like it makes me drink more water
during the day versus if I were to drink
like out of a swell bottle which I used
to be obsessed with small bottles but
not anymore just because I feel like you
don't like drink the water as much so
this is what our fridge looks like and
these eggs right here I guess are the
ones on hard-boiled so I'm just gonna
have two of these for breakfast and I
love having hard-boiled eggs just
because they're so easy to just peel and
a tip that one's running away a tip that
I have for eating hard-boiled eggs is to
salt the pan like of water when you make
them because it makes them so much
easier to peel so that is my tip of the
day and I just used pink Himalayan salt
because it's better for you than regular
salt
and then this is my favorite vegan suit
I wore it when we went on the Cabaret
and I got so many questions about where
it's from and it's this white this in my
closet is still a mess you guys have
been asking for a full closet tour but I
really need to figure out like what I'm
doing with all this junk and like get my
stuff organized before I can do a closet
tour so now I'm gonna figure out what I
want to wear today I have no idea which
where Emma is it cold is it cold out
yeah it's cold so I don't know what to
wear that's really weird I had a dream
last night that I was wearing my Canada
Goose jacket that's so funny I don't
know if I should wear like little pants
like this maybe I'll wear this with
sneakers and all of this would look
weird and like a denim jacket I might
try it on and see how it looks so I
think I finally have my full outfit I'll
show you guys in a sec I don't know if
it's like what I'm gonna wear 100% I'm
wearing this denim jacket that you guys
have seen in a bunch of videos from
three people and then this knit top
which is from Palomar on Cape Cod and
then I'm wearing these princess Polly
high-waisted like loose pants and then
these are the shoes that I have on there
just slip-on suede nude sandals and they
are from Target this is my fall outfit
behind Emma now uh getting ready but I'm
just wearing outfit that I showed you
with my little shoes but this is like a
full body so you can see and then Emma
said that I should use the white bag
which I agree it looks so much better
and I also put on my Apple watch just
because it matched my whole outfit but
it's dead so that's when you know that
is the real me so yeah this is my outfit
we're gonna go to lunch right now
it's like 11:30 so we need to get going
but I just wanted to show you guys like
what I do in a typical morning and leave
a comment down below if you guys like
seeing videos like this I don't want to
see more morning routines and this was
kind of like a vlog style it was really
casual because I don't know for me at
least I feel like my videos are more
casual like I don't really like doing
sit-down videos that much I just would
rather have it be more personal and like
connect with you guys more so if you
guys want to see like more types of
videos like this like morning routine
nighttime routine any type of routine
