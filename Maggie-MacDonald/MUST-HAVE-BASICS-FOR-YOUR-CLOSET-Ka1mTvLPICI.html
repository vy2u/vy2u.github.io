today's video I just thought I would sit
down and show you guys some of my
must-haves basics for my closet I'm so
excited to be working in collab with the
app Poshmark for this video thank you so
much Poshmark for sponsoring this if you
guys don't know what Poshmark is I am so
obsessed with it it is an app where you
buy and sell clothing and you guys know
if you've been following me for a long
time I've been using Poshmark since
around 2015 and what I've learned over
in the past few years is something
called the 80/20 rule and basically what
that is is that you wear 80 percent of
your clothes
20 percent of the time which is so true
for me at least I only wear my specific
basics that I know that I love and I
tend to buy more trendy pieces and items
that I will wear once and then end up
selling on Poshmark so that's why I
thought that today's video would be
helpful just so I can sit down and show
you guys some of my basics but first I
just wanted to tell you guys a little
bit about Poshmark they have so many
amazing brands on the app that you can
buy from like Nike Adidas they even have
high-end brands like Louis Vuitton you
can literally find anything on Poshmark
and most of it is in very very good
condition if not brand new and you can
buy things on the app that are priced
much lower than what they retail for so
if you're looking to buy some staple
pieces but you don't want to splurge on
them and spend a lot of money in the
store you can definitely go in Poshmark
in search for whatever you're looking
for chances are you will find it they're
brand new and if not gently used I will
have a link in the description for you
guys to click in download Poshmark
if you guys don't have it already and
you should totally follow my closet it
is going to be right here on the screen
I'll just put my username and then I'll
just show you a little bit about my
Poshmark
so this is what my closet looks like I
just have a ton of things on it from
sweaters jackets shirts boots you name
it I'm always selling things that I
don't wear anymore just trying to make
room for the new things that I buy so
you guys should totally follow me on
Poshmark
again I will have the link down below
for you guys to download it and comment
down below your username
and if you guys see anything in my
closet that you would like to buy feel
free to make an offer I'm always open to
taking your but you guys's offers and
selling my items and just getting it out
if you guys want to offer me a lower
price do not hesitate and in my closet I
will have 10 new items that I'm listing
so you guys should go totally check them
out and without further ado what let's
get started and starting off with
jackets for the must-haves basics in my
closet I have two different jackets to
choose from and I think that it is so
necessary that everybody has a good
denim jacket in their closet
this one is actually for sale on my
Poshmark I am selling it because it fits
me a little bit tight and I want to get
one that's a little bit more oversized
and bigger so if you guys are interested
in this denim jacket from j.crew it is a
size extra small just go check out my
Poshmark it will be linked down below
and I think a denim jacket is amazing to
have in your closet because you can
really pair it with anything you can
wear it with a leather skirt you can
wear it with a pair of joggers a pair of
leggings whatever it may be I think that
this is a great staple to have it's just
something like to throw on that will
really add something to your outfit and
the next jacket that everybody should
own is a leather jacket I just have this
black one right here from blank and when
I see you guys know I'm obsessed with
this one it just has all of this silver
detailing and buckles zippers on it I
think that leather jackets are
absolutely amazing they really make your
outfit look so much more edgy and put
together and I love throwing it on over
like a black candy like I'm wearing
right now with a pair of leggings and
sneakers
it just makes any outfit look so much
more put together so if you guys don't
have a leather jacket I highly recommend
that you go out there and get one and
next going into pants I think that
everybody should have a good pair of
jeans in your closet and for me I only
own one pair of jeans I think having at
least one good pair of jeans that you
know fits so well and goes with
everything is really important for your
closet just because there's no sense in
having a bunch of different pairs of
jeans that don't fit you that well and
that you're not happy with so if you
find one good pair that look amazing on
you just stick to them and you honestly
don't even need any other ones because
people really aren't going to notice if
you wear the same pair of jeans twice
like for me I wear my Abercrombie ripped
girlfriend jeans all the time they
look amazing and they fit amazing so
honestly if it ain't broke don't fix it
so having one good pair of jeans in your
closet is definitely a closet essential
for me next I think everybody should
have a good pair of leggings and if you
haven't tried out the Lululemon aligns
yet you guys need them you will thank me
later and if you do wear the Alliance
comment down below and let me know they
are these naked sensation high-rise
leggings from Lululemon and they are 7/8
length so they go right about to your
ankle they fit so well they really suck
you in and they feel like you're wearing
nothing
the material is so thin it literally it
makes you feel like you're not wearing
pants at all I have them in so many
different colors but I think definitely
having a plain black pair is a staple
for my closet it is definitely a basic
that I wear every single day it's always
my go-to wearing a pair of leggings with
like a crop top in a leather jacket
that's one of my most favorite outfits
so if you guys don't have Lululemon
aligns yet you should definitely invest
in a pair because I promise you you will
get so much use out of them and they are
such good quality they will last you so
long so they definitely are a great pair
of leggings to invest in and now moving
out to tops I just have this black
long-sleeve Free People thermal and this
is a great basic to have in your closet
just because you can throw it on with
jeans you can throw it on with leggings
and layer it with a leather jacket and
you have yourself a perfect outfit it's
just plain black oversized you can never
go wrong with something like that and
it's also such good quality this one is
actually for sale in my Poshmark as well
I have so many black tops like this
that's why I was like you know what I
need to get rid of it but if you guys
are interested it's in my pouch Marc
like I said link is down below but
definitely having a plain long black
sleeve like oversized shirt is a great
basic to have next I think that it is so
important to have a good body suit so I
just have this black and white seamless
one from forever 21 these were so
affordable and they go with literally
everything you can wear them with jeans
skirts shorts whatever it may be they go
with literally everything and they were
so affordable so I think that these are
definitely my top two basics that I have
in my closet even my roommate Kayleigh
stole my first
lack seamless bodysuit cream forever21
and she like claimed it as her own just
because it is that amazing and she wears
that all the time with everything so
these definitely you will get so much
use out of and a little bit similar to
the bodysuit some forever 21 I just have
two tank tops this black one right here
and also this white one and they are
just little cropped camis I think that
these are my absolute favorite items in
my closet I wear them every single day
I'm not even lying I'm always wearing a
pair of leggings with one of these so I
just think that they are perfect staples
to have they are great basic they go
with literally everything you can pair
them so many different ways and they are
five dollars I think this one still has
a tag on it because I just bought it the
other day I replaced the other one that
I used to have literally five 90 you
cannot go wrong with an item like this
just because they're so cheap and they
go so well with so many different
outfits that I think that once I
discovered these I will never go back it
has really made me realize how much I do
wear the basic items that I have in my
closet and last but not least I just
wanted to show you guys a pair of shoes
that I've been absolutely loving and
they are the white Adidas Stan Smith's
with the green on the back these shoes
are one of my favorite basics in my
closet just because they are white and
playing they go with literally
everything and I think that they look so
good with leggings and tank tops and
like leather jackets or denim jackets
whatever it may be that you guys want to
wear they go with everything you can
even wear them with jeans and a cute
tank top and if you guys know me you
know that I love the athleisure style so
but these go absolutely perfect with
anything that I wear they're my favorite
right now and that concludes my
must-haves basics for my wardrobe I hope
that you guys enjoyed this video and
over the past few months I have realized
what basics are necessary in my wardrobe
and what staples I wear all the time so
I just wanted to share all of those
items with you guys Poshmark has
definitely helped me clean up my closet
and realize which basics are necessary
and which things I wear all the time and
things that I would never get rid of and
like I was saying in the beginning of
the video I will have a link down below
in the description for you to download
the push bar cap for free in the app
store I hope that you guys enjoyed this
video and I will see you in my next one
