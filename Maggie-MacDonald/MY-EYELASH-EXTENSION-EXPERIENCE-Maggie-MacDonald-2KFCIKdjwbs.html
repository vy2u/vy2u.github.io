today's video is gonna be super casual I
just wanted to sit down and talk to you
about a topic that I've been getting a
ton of questions on lately and that is
my eyelash extensions yes
my eyelashes right now they are fake
they're not real this is what my
eyelashes look like after having them on
for three week I think three weeks is
about the time limit where people start
getting fills I know I think it's like
two to three weeks that you can keep
them on because as you can see I know
you guys probably can't tell because
I've had them on for three weeks so I
know what they looked like before but
they have started to fall out and kind
of spaced out a little bit and I just
thought that there would it be a no
better day to sit down and film this
video than today because I am getting
them filled today I just wanted to show
you guys what they look like now versus
what they're gonna look like after I get
them all touched up and everything the
first question that I've been getting a
lot about my eyelash extensions was how
much were they and my eyelash extensions
for a full set which means that I had
nothing on my eyes before just my
natural lashes and they put on a full
set of fake lashes and they were 120
Plus obviously TIFF and I tip to our 20%
so that it ended up being around 144 for
the full set I don't know how much it's
gonna cost to get my fill done after
three weeks I'll let you guys know today
after I get them done but the girl that
I went to was a lot cheaper than going
to an actual salon because she does own
her own business and she just kind of
does it like on her own rather than
doing it for a company I know that where
I live on the Cape eyelash extensions
can be at close to $200 and even over
that so for me I just wanted to get them
done by her because I know that it was a
lot cheaper and one of my good friends
that was on my field hockey team last
year she had been going to her for so
long and she would always come to field
hockey and she'd have her eyelash
extensions on and they literally would
look so good and she wouldn't have to
wear any makeup because having them on
literally just like completes her whole
entire look
and the main reason why I wanted to get
these eyelash extensions was because I
am the type of person where I will wake
up for class in the morning and I don't
want to have to put on makeup or do
anything like that so I literally just
wash my face and then do my whole
skincare routine and then I'll either
put a hat on put my hair in a ponytail
and I'll get out the door and I'll go to
class and having eyelash extensions just
makes you look so much more put together
in my opinion and I just think that
having them on is just so easy and
effortless and I just love the way that
it look and it also saves me a ton of
time in the morning
so having extensions is not as easy as
it looks or as it may seem like now
having them for three weeks I'm a lot
more used to it but right when I got
them on I was like freaking out because
you can't use any products on your face
that have any types of oils in them so
for me I had to go home and look at the
back of all my products and like look
them up online to see what ingredients
they had because if I was gonna spend
that much money to get the extensions
put on I want to be able to use products
that aren't gonna be like making the
glue adhesive wear off because I want
them to last as long as they can I want
them to look good I spent a lot of money
on them so I was gonna really take care
of them so the first thing that I did
was I went through all my products and
checked which ones were not gonna be
good for my face and my extensions and
that was honestly a lot of products that
I used my face moisturizer I had to
replace I had to replace my makeup
remover I used to use the micellar
cleansing water and there's an
ingredient in that that actually takes
off the glue adhesive so it makes it
break down and your eyelash extensions
get loose so that's one of the things
that was difficult for me to have to
adjust to I had to go out and buy all
new products so I got a new moisturizer
I got a new makeup remover and also I
put on a face oil every single night
well I used to before I went to bed and
it like would make my face glowing and
radiant in the morning and I can't use
it anymore and I'm so upset because that
was one of my favorite things and one of
my favorite parts of my beauty routine
so it's really sad that I can't do that
anymore but I just use my normal toner
in serum and then put on an oil-free
moisturizer on my face
and when I take off
make up like at night or whatever that
may be I just use my oil-free makeup
remover and I'll put it on a cotton pad
and then just wipe it around my face
like a normally one and then if I have
any eye makeup on I have to take a q-tip
and then just dip it in and then take
off my eye makeup with the q-tip because
if you use the cotton pad on your eye
and wipe it you have any chance of
taking off your extensions and also
getting the little fuzzes from the
cotton pad in your eyelashes which would
not be fun it would be such a hassle but
other than that I think they're really
easy to maintain I am so used to
sleeping with them now because the first
few nights were difficult because I
literally would lay in my bed and I'd be
faced up like sleeping and I wouldn't
want to like move over anyway because
like the chance of ruining them or
rubbing my eyes and I really have to get
used to not rubbing my eyes when I wash
my face you have to kind of like wash
around your eyes and then like rinse it
thoroughly and my favorite part of
having the extensions is getting out of
the shower and when they're all wet and
long just taking the little spoolie that
the technician gives you and then just
like brushing them out that's my
absolute favorite and then honestly when
you get out of the shower and I lay in
bed at night I go on snapchat and I look
at myself and you look like you are
coming back from like the Grammys or
something because your eyelashes are so
long and you have no makeup on and it's
just so glamorous in such a good feeling
and I know for me having the eyelash
extensions has just made me a lot more
like calm well not that I wasn't
confident before but it really is like a
confidence booster it makes me feel good
when I don't have makeup on like I can
go to the gym wearing no makeup at all
but having really long eyelashes and it
just feels so much better and I think
personally that it looks a lot better so
I just wanted to touch upon some of the
basics with eyelash extensions and I'm
getting my fill done at 3 o'clock right
now it's 136 I have to leave soon but I
will bring you guys along with me I want
to show you guys what they look like
before versus what they look like after
and I'm gonna like take off on my makeup
that I have on right now just because I
want a fresh face and you also can't
shower for 24 hours after you get your
extensions so I want to be able to be
like clean and fresh so I can get them
done
and then after that not have to worry
about like touching my face or washing
it or anything because you cannot get
them wet oh and another thing that I
wanted to tell you guys if you don't
know what the extensions actually are or
how they work is you sit down in the
chair and she will put tape like
underneath my eye and on top of it so my
eyelashes are literally like the only
things that you can see my eyes are
completely closed and I just lay there
and she will go through and individually
put an extension on each of your lashes
and so that's how they get like the fold
defined look because there's a fake lash
attached to all of my natural lashes and
as your eyelash extensions are on for a
longer periods of time they do fall out
naturally you're not supposed to touch
them you have tools to pick out them
like if you see them falling off don't
touch them because they are attached to
your natural lash so you have like the
chance of ripping out one of your
natural lashes if you try to rip out an
extensions I'm so happy with the way
that they turned out I know that it's
something that I'm going to be keeping
up with I just really like the idea of
them and just like how effortless they
are and they really take so much more
time out of getting ready
it's crazy I've saved so much time like
this morning I got up 20 minutes before
my class and I brush my teeth brush my
hair wash my face got dressed and
laughed like it was so fast and yeah so
I'm gonna stop rambling on now I will
show you guys what my eyelash extensions
look like after I get a fill and if you
have any other questions just leave them
down below I will answer all of them and
yeah so I will bring you guys along with
me to go get my eyelashes redone this is
my extensions up close I don't know if
you guys can see but I also need to get
my eyebrows and I'm so sorry
these are what they look like and I
think that they're a little bit
like see these ones right here a little
bit tangled in together she's gonna fix
those but I think that they look perfect
for three weeks
like they look really good I can
definitely tell when I put makeup on
that it has been three weeks so because
there were a lot more full before but
I'm still so happy with the way that
they look right now and personally in my
opinion yes I would recommend eyelash
extensions I know it's not for everybody
it may not be your look your style
people may not want to spend the money
on it because they could just wear
mascara but for me I think it's a lot
more practical it just makes it so much
easier to get ready in the morning and
like I love the way that they look I
love that the way that they make me feel
yeah so I don't know I just really liked
them a lot
and I would recommend them to all of you
I know that sometimes people get eyelash
extensions put on and then they end up
getting reactions to it it may be the
glue that they use it may be the
material of the extensions but none of
that happened to me I'm so happy with
the way that they looked and I cannot
wait to get them filled today it has
been exactly three weeks since I got
them put on and next week is my 21st
birthday so I wanted to have them fresh
for my birthday and Thanksgiving so I'm
glad that I'm getting them done today
but yeah so I'm gonna go get them filled
right now I'll bring you guys along with
me and show you what they look like
after and again if you guys have any

watching so I just got my eyelashes
filled I'm in the car now
and I feel so good that getting it done
I literally fall asleep kind of when I'm
in the chair or like laying on a little
bad thing but it's so relaxing like you
literally are just closing your eyes and
like getting them filled and I feel like
I fall asleep and you know when you're
Lee kind of asleep I kind of awake and
you like have those weird like thoughts
and dreams that like kept happening to
me it was so weird
but I don't know if you can really see
this is what they look like when they're
filled she just like filled in all the
places where like they fell out and they
got like I don't know I guess like where
they fell out like where they were like
