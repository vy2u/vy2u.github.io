gonna vlog my day today I just woke up
and they scratch my face I just noticed
that it really hurts it's like bleeding
um but I decided that I'm gonna block my
day today today is like my first
official day of summer I just got back
from being away for a Memorial Day
weekend I was visiting Tyler in his
hometown so that was really fun and then
now I'm back home on the Cape and I'm
gonna have a full day to do basically
all of the stuff that I normally do
during the summer so I just thought that
it would be fun to like kick off the
summer and do a little vlog and hope
that you guys enjoy
I'm gonna make some breakfast and what
I'm gonna have is a full big tall cup of
water this is just one of the travel nut
mugs but you know what I mean
this little travel thing from Starbucks
I just have the venti size and I fill it
up with ice and water every single
morning and I have one of these before I
eat breakfast every day then I'm gonna
peel two hard-boiled eggs I really have
been into heart balloon legs lately just
because I eat like scrambled eggs and
omelets at school so much that I was
nice to come home and have some
hard-boiled eggs I just feel like
there's so much easier especially
because you don't have to like clean any
pans or anything and then we're gonna
make a little fruit cup with organic
raspberries and organic cut up
strawberries and breakfast is done so
usually I just have a different
variation of like fruit with eggs
whether it be scrambled hard-boiled an
omelet and obviously you got
strawberries and raspberries I already
told you guys but I just took a picture
of my food because I'm gonna post it on
my food Instagram account
oh my god one of my followers just
tagged me in this picture and it says me
after I get my lash film and that's
literally me that's gonna be me tomorrow
because I have no eyelashes left but I
have this new food account it's called
Maggie's eats with three E's and I just
post like my breakfast lunch and dinner
on it and since I'm gonna be home for
the summer I just thought that it would
be fun to show you guys like what I'm
making during the day and stuff and like
that's my snack that I had yesterday I
had that for lunch that was my dinner so
now I'm gonna post a photo of this on my
Instagram but you guys should totally
comment on one of the pictures and
followers account a few
our following from this video I'm going
to the beach with my friend Molly so
into my closet this is my closet by the
way if you didn't see the video I kind
of gave a mini tour but I need to do
something about all of this so that'll
be for a different video I'm going to do
a full closet to our ones it's all done
but I need to pick out a bathing suit I
don't know which one to wear these are
all my bathing suits for Aruba that I'm
keeping separate from my other bikinis
because I want to do like a haul of all
the ones that I wore for you guys just
so it's super easy to find them all
actually didn't wear that yellow one so
I'm gonna take that out okay and so
these are all the ones that I can wear
right now I don't know which one to wear
I just got this one from Free People
you guys would have seen a couple of the
logs ago and it matches my nails but
this one's really really cute actually I
might wear this this is a good option
all of my bathing suits are literally
from Zappa and I know I said my Miami
vlog that he didn't really likes awful
bikinis but I don't know I just feel
like they fit me really well like once
you find a style that you like in a
style that fits you then they end up
like actually really working out and
they're super cheap I have my sleepover
bag packed my backpack of stuff that I'm
gonna need today my glasses in there
I've made each bag and I was supposed to
leave at 10:15 didn't know what time it
was came downstairs
10:14 I'm like on point today it's
actually disgusting how much pollen is
on Cape Cod right now you can you see
that
that is nasty that's why I didn't go for
a run this morning because I knew that
if I tried to run it would just be
getting like in my eyes and in my mouth
so I'm gonna go to SoulCycle tomorrow
morning and like take the day off I'm
working out and I don't have any which a
liver fluid that's awesome
one thing you just noticed yesterday
I didn't have coffee yesterday because
the Marylou's on the cave is not that
close to my house it's like a 20-minute
Drive like depending on if there's
traffic and stuff so I was like you know
what I don't need coffee today I'm gonna
go without it I'm just gonna go for a
run and like lay outside try to like get
away from caffeine and not like have to
drink it every single day because when I
wake up in the morning first thing I
think of is a coffee and even when I'm
with Tyler like over the weekend I'd be
like okay like in the morning and he'd
be like coffee and Vig yeah so I
couldn't do it yesterday I felt thrown
off all day also there's a full moon so
I feel like that could've had something
to do with it but it's also the fact
that I didn't have coffee so I'm gonna
go get coffee right now but arlynn just
texted me and sent me a photo of this
place in Falmouth and he goes Maggie's
eat come get this
and then I was like I want it where's it
from he goes village cafe and fountain
if he would like it it's like an acai
bowl and that's funny because like I'm
going to find with right now
today I got banana not black from
Marylou's and then I got one for my best
friend Molly who I don't think you guys
have ever met in the vlogs but her and I
go to the beach right now so I picked
her up a coffee and I also got me one
but she just got banana nut with a
little bit of almond milk in it and I'm
so excited to drink this because I
literally haven't had coffee or like
Marylou's in the past um I want to say
weak ah so good it's literally so good
today but I just get my coffee black
everybody always asks me on my like
Instagram stories whenever I get
Starbucks like what I get from Starbucks
and what I get for coffee like when I go
places and I literally just get black
coffee no sweetener no nothing added
just plain black coffee sometimes like
if I'm in the mood I'll get like a
little bit of almond milk but I haven't
been doing that lately just because like
during the summer I just like love the
taste of like black coffee and sometimes
I just feel like I need to like not have
it as like bitter so I'll put almond
milk in it but
yeah usually just plain black coffee so
I'm ready this is great in at great
insight on Instagram and my friend Molly
my number one bitch so good I feel like
eating sandwiches on the beach it's so
much more enjoyable than like eating
them I know like wraps on the beach or
the bass and this one is turkey cheese
lettuce tomato banana peppers spicy
mustard and I got it from the West Bell
mark and then I also go out of
SmartWater Maggie's eats everybody so we
had a successful beach day do I look tan
now I changed my bikini into this Molly
Jason bikini because I had to take
pictures with that cuz I'm the Molly J
