close-up snapshots of him smiling how we
feel that our parents aren't open this
weekend and we have the whole weekend to
our south to chill so if anyone's trying
to party and hit us up open now just
right here I'm like getting sick again I
swear because it's like the trees are
different here and then at my school so
I'm like just getting over struck
and now I feel like congested so I need
to like have a claritin-d or something
but I'm here with a baby girl and big
girl they're gonna go into Whole Foods
and we are gonna get lunch we have like
a really busy day planned don't we yeah
so yeah baby girl and I are gonna go
into Whole Foods to get lunch and then
we're gonna like do a little running
errands and some other stuff I'm not
gonna tell you I'm just gonna let you
watch the vlog so yeah and oh my god so
yeah I hope you guys enjoy this right
here is like my vibe right now this
makes you want to go home and make a
pumpkin pie like look at these like that
looks so good
never had oh my god I love this
I like wish I had my own house so I can
like buy all this stuff and like make it
my kids
so this is what we decided to get for
lunch
we're eating at this a vegan minestrone
soup and we got like a little sushi
looks so good I know me too
yeah we're going to alta right now
that's our second stop yeah done oh oh I
need to get a new beauty sponge thing I
don't use a beauty blender for all of
you up there just letting you know I'll
show you what I use so right now we are
in the Starbucks parking lot going to go
like do homework and get a lot of work
done cuz I mean I just have so much that
we have to get done we feel like if we
do it like go home and try to do it
there
we literally won't get anything done so
that's why we came to Starbucks but I
have a huge bag right here filled with
all my shopping bags from today and I
just wanted to like do a little mini
haul kind of before we go in because I
want to bring one of the things that I
got inside with me but I just got these
Real Techniques sponge --is and these
are for 2-pack with $10 from Ulta and
these are so much better than the beauty
blenders I just picked they're a lot
softer and they're just a lot bigger and
honestly like it's a sponge that you're
applying your makeup with you don't need
to buy a $20 sponge like this will get
the job done I think that these are
great so I love that then I just got
some stuff from Sephora I picked up two
of these little traveling like makeup
tasting ease I don't know because I
really just feel like I use the same
products all the time and I don't use it
out many products so I just wanted to
get that because what I do traveling and
like need overnight I don't know just
like something to keep my makeup in I
never know what to bring coz I don't
need space for that many things so I
just got those and then we got oh we got
some of the flower bomb samples because
you could use your Beauty Insider points
and get them in this perfume literally
so so good so I think that's my new
obsession right now but I got the senti
Beauty primer I use Emma's this morning
thanks Emma I used it this morning
oh my god I want to scream out the
window of the car right now because
fenty is the best makeup come
ever I seriously think that everybody
should use Fendi
I'm wearing the primary the foundation
that under-eye concealer like I
highlighted in my face
everything is Fendi on my face right now
except for my blush and my highlighter
but I use a little bit of my stick
anyway I love Mt
so I was happy to get that primary
because I used to use the Laura Mercier
one and it just made my it was like
gluey and sticky
and like I don't know I like didn't I
didn't like it but anyway so then I went
to Best Buy and I got this shoot I got
this for my blog in camera because well
obviously my only camera that I have I
don't know what I'm like acting like
vlogging camera um well I guess you can
say that but I don't know if you guys
saw my vlog that I did and when I was
involved in with farlan but he was using
my camera and he grabbed it in my little
what do you want to call this thing like
try popping a tripod my camera flung off
it and like literally flew off and so it
was just like I got off of Amazon and it
wasn't like a nice one so I went to Best
Buy and about this one and this is the
real deal let me tell ya so I'm really
excited to use this so yeah I'm gonna
put my camera on it now and then we're
gonna go inside of Starbucks and we're
gonna get some drinks and do homework
but and I'll update you guys with what I
got because I really get a lot of
questions on when I get from Starbucks
