today's video I'm going to be showing
you my skincare routine so for step one
I am just going to be using my micellar
cleansing water to take off all the
makeup that I have on my face and I am
going to be using this micellar water by
the brand called pearl essence and it
just has some aloe in it and so I'm
gonna put that on a cotton pad and rub
it all over my face just to get all of
the makeup off of it that I have on from
during the day
and next I'm going to be using my clinic
take the day off cleansing balm just to
take all of my eye makeup off so I'm
gonna put a little bit on my fingers and
then just rub it all over my eyelashes
just to get all of the mascara off then
I'm gonna take a towel just to rub off
all of the excess oil and then just take
a little bit more to make sure that it
all comes off
then after I am fresh out of the shower
I'm just going to be using this Pantene
detangler spray and spraying it all over
my hair I don't need to do anything else
to my hair it just dries naturally
straight so I just take my wet brush and
then brush out all the tangles and then
let it air dry
step three is my favorite step of the
whole entire routine and that is using
my toner I just used this toner by
L'Oreal that I got from Ulta and they
put it on a little cotton pad and then
rub it all over my face and it honestly
feels so refreshing and I know that it's
just gonna get all of the dirt off and
everything else that didn't come off
when I did wash my face earlier
then I'm going to be going in with my
Kensington apothecary serum and this
serum is so amazing it really brightens
up my skin and makes sure that it
doesn't have any imperfections I love
this product so much so I'm just gonna
take a little drop of this and then rub
it all over my face and really make sure
that it's moisturizing
then in replace of a moisturizer I'm
just gonna be using this Tenzing ttan
apothecary facial oil I really love
using an oil at night time before I go
to bed because I just feel like it
really helps my face kind of stay
hydrated and really I don't really know
how to describe it but basically it just
makes my face so soft and I think that
it really just makes it even and evens
up my skin tone so I really love the oil
and I highly recommend that if you
wanted to have soft skin that you use an
oil instead of a moisturizer at
nighttime
next I'm going to be taking my
Kensington apothecary facial balm in
just putting a little bit on my finger
and then rubbing it around at the bottom
of my nose I didn't really stick this
weekend so I've been blowing my nose a
ton and I just know that if I use the
facial balm it's gonna really help all
my dry areas
and finally I'm going to be going in
with my Mario Badescu drying lotion I'm
gonna take a little cotton swab and then
dip it into the product just get a
little bit on there and then put it onto
anything limoges that I have on my face
which is that one as you can see right
my cheek so this product is amazing and
I swear it makes it go away overnight
and to end this video I just wanted to
let you guys know that the Kensington
apothecary products are powerful natural
and non-toxic they are all organic they
come in these cute little boxes like
this I love them so much this skincare
line is my absolute favorite right now
