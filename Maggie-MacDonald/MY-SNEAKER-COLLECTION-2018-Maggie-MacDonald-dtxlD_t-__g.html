today's a video I'm gonna be doing the
highly requested sneaker collection you
guys know that I love up Leisure I'm
always wearing different pairs of
sneakers from my outfits I just really
like to be comfortable so I thought I
would sit down today and show you guys
all the sneakers that I own and this
video is in collaboration with Poshmark
it's my favorite app ever it is a
clothing app where you can buy and sell
different pieces of clothing shoes
whatever it may be they have so many
different brands like Nike Adidas
Louboutin you name it they have
everything I love using Poshmark just to
keep my closet in rotation and keeping
it flowing just because I feel like I
get sick of my stuff so easily and
instead of like wasting money on it and
getting rid of it I love to sell my
items on Poshmark if you guys want to
check out my closet on Poshmark I am
always selling different things on it
and I will also have a link down below
that you guys can download the app for
free and also if you have a Poshmark
already comment your username it down
below just so like we can check out each
other's closets and I will also have my
Poshmark username at down below for you
guys without further ado let's get
started so first I'm gonna start off
with my absolute favorite pair of shoes
ever and I just have the adidas gazelles
these are actually Emma's they're her
grey ones right here and I have them in
red but she has my red ones right now
and I have her grey ones we switched a
couple weeks ago and I wore hers and she
wore mine and I just never gave them
back so these are just the plain grey
suede ones and they have the white
stripes on the side and then they just
say gazelle and gold
these are definitely a staple to have I
wear them with literally everything I
love the gray color and I actually wish
that I originally got gray just because
they go with so much but she ended up
getting them we have the same size shoe
so I just wear hers all the time and
they do run really big so I recommend
downsizing a whole shoe size because
usually I wear an eight but I have to
get a seven in the gazelles the next
pair of shoes I have are just these red
adidas campus these are so comfortable I
love them so much they're way more
comfortable than the gazelles I feel
like the gazelles take longer to break
in and these ones you can just put right
on and they're so comfortable and
they're really plush I feel like and I
have these inside
seven and a half I went down a half size
in the campus and the next pair shoes
are my staples they are my Dida Stan
Smith's I just have the white ones with
the green detailing here on the back
they go with literally everything and I
love how they are a white leather
because they're so easy to clean off and
I have these in a size 8 they run pretty
true to size and they fit very
comfortable with a pair of socks and I
just feel like these ones go with
everything and they're so comfortable I
highly recommend if you're looking for a
good pair of staple sneakers definitely
get the adidas Stan Smith's
and then I also have another pair of
gazelles and these are just the tan ones
and again they look exactly the same as
the gray ones are just the tan suede
they're kind of dirty I have had them
for a very long time but again this
cream color is definitely a really good
color it goes with everything it's super
neutral I've really really liked it a
lot and I'm excited to wear these again
in the spring I feel like I kind of took
the winter off from wearing them just
because they aren't really that wintery
but I'm so excited to start wearing
these again they're definitely a great
shoe to have during the spring time and
then I just have these gray sneakers by
the brand greats and they are kind of
like a sweetie leather material I
currently describe it the inside is all
leather and they're very sturdy I really
like these sneakers I don't wear them as
much as I should because I honestly
forgot that I had them but I really like
them they're just this plain grey and
then they have that white detailing
along the bottom super neutral and
versatile they really go with everything
and I feel like these are more on like
the wintry side so maybe I'll have to
put them away and start wearing them
next winter but I really really like
them a lot and then I have the Puma
basket seekers and they're just these
grey ones right here and they have all
of these bow detailing on the front and
I don't really wear these that much just
because they're so crazy and I honestly
forgot that I really had them especially
because during the winter I didn't want
to ruin them with all the snow and stuff
here in New England but I'm so excited
to wear these this spring I just think
that they're so fun and I don't know
they just really can dress up any outfit
I love these I got them in a size
woman's 8 so definitely they run true to
size I personally think and I highly
recommend getting these if you're
looking for a pair of fun sneakers to
like dress up any outfit and
and I just have two pairs of Yeezy
sneakers and these are from the website
yes easy calm they actually sent me
these a while back and they are just
these zebra ones with the red writing on
the side like that and then also these
gray ones with the orange writing on the
side which I haven't worn yet but these
are super comfortable just plain easy
style I don't really wear them too much
just because I feel like I like my Jesus
enemies more but I really should start
wearing them again maybe I'll start
wearing them during the spring and
summer and then these seekers I love to
work out in these are just the APL
sneakers and they are kind of a knit
material and they're just black white
and gray I got these I just dropped one
of them I got these can I stop I got
these in a size 8 and a half and I got
them for Christmas from Lululemon
actually because I heard that these
sneakers are amazing to workout in and
they really are they have a ton of
support so I like to wear these like
what I'm doing yourself in the treadmill
or going for a run and I'm gonna be
getting a ton of use out of them this
summer when I am like going for more
runs outside and stuff like that so if
you're looking for a really really good
pair of workout sneakers I highly
recommend getting a pls Khloe Kardashian
actually wears them in all of her snaps
and she has so many different pairs of
them so that's how you know that they're
like the real deal
and I know that they come in so many
different colors and styles which is
really cool as well and these are just
the ones that I got again I really like
them a lot super comfortable definitely
worth the money and before I show you my
favorite shoes of all time I have these
converse because I feel like everybody
has to have a pair of Converse in their
closet so I just have these navy blue
ones and they're actually personalized
my friends used to always joke about it
Marcus used to be like oh my god Maggie
like you're meam converse but I have my
monogram right on the tongue they're
kind of dirty because I've used to wear
them out all the time freshman year but
they're just the plain navy blue ones
with my monogram I don't really wear
them that much anymore a super girl that
I had them but I feel like everybody
should have a pair of Commerce in their
closet and now my favorite shoes of all
time the adidas nmds these ones I'm
actually going to post in my
smart cause that you guys can check them
out I'll have the link down below but
they were my first pair of nmds ever
they're the white ones just plain white
and they have this blue detailing on the
back these are a size woman's 8 and I
love these shoes so much they are my
ride-or-die favorite shoes ever
my first their ever that got me obsessed
with nmds but I have to get rid of them
because I got a brand new pair so that's
why I'm gonna be selling those just
because you'll see why I got a brand new
pair of nmds the other day in the mail
if you saw my snapshot you would have
seen that I posted picture of these they
are my absolute favorite style in the
whole world I have them in grey right
here they're just the plain gray ones
and they're kind of knit in sock
material so what you don't have to wear
socks with them which you probably
should because they end up smelling
really bad if you workout in them but
they're just the plain grey and they are
all gray with white on the bottom super
comfortable and I did size down a whole
size and these ones right here from my
size of the white ones I got a size 8 in
the plain white ones that I'm selling on
my Poshmark and these ones are a size 7
but I'm so excited that I just got these
they're absolutely gorgeous here they
are the plain white nmds and on the back
I think they have a little baby blue tag
right there but they're just completely
white brand new I'm so obsessed with
them I can't wait to wear them now that
I have like a little tan the my absolute
favorite that's what I'm selling and my
other white ones just because I just got
these ones that I like the style so much
so I feel like I should get rid of ones
out with the old in with the new so yeah
and that concludes my sneaker collection
