today's video I'm gonna be showing you
how I achieve my Spring Break 2018
makeup look this is a look that I've
been wearing the past couple weeks when
I was in Miami with Kayleigh and then
when I just went to Miami with Gretchen
Lucy and Emma and you guys have been
asking me all the time like which
products that I've been using because my
face is just looking so natural and
glowy so I literally am only using a few
products and I am so excited to share
this routine with you and I will have
all these items linked down below for
you so you can check them out and
without further ado let's get started
okay so the first step that I'm gonna be
doing before doing my whole makeup look
is I'm gonna prep my lips and I'm just
gonna be putting on some of this aqua
for just to hydrate them and get them
ready to do my makeup this has been one
of my absolute favorites lately I really
like it because I like really nourishes
your lips and hydrates them a ton and
the next step is going to be bronzer and
I am gonna take the hoola bronzer by
benefit and this kabuki brush right here
and just applying it literally all over
my face and since I am a naturally tan I
don't like to wear any foundation just
because I feel like it makes my face
look really cakey and it gets rid of my
freckles which I don't like and the
brand of this brush is vanity planet and
I will have a link in the description
box down below you guys can use my code
mag palette for 70% off the cruelty free
brush that and these are the brushes
that I've been using lately I really
really like them and I like that they
come in a big set just because I like
having brushes that are all the same
brands I don't know I just really like
how like soft they are and when they're
all the same so they are the brushes
that I've been absolutely loving lately
and so I'm just gonna put a little bit
down my neck
just make sure that it is absolutely
everywhere all over my face just to give
me like a more natural glow and I like
to put bronzer all over my face just
because it makes my face more even I
feel like and the next step I'm just
gonna take an angled contour brush with
the same benefit hoola bronzer and then
kind of just going and making a three on
my face with my forehead and then down
into my cheekbone and then on my jaw
line just to add some more precise
contouring and give my face more
definition so I'm going to do that to
both sides just really lightly and then
also I'm gonna add some too
besides my nose also the bottom here
I'm going over it one last time and for
the next step I'm gonna be taking my
tart blush and it is in the shade
glisten and I'm going to be using this
big blush brush right here I am
absolutely so that it's so fluffy and
soft and so I'm just gonna be taking
some of that blush and applying it
directly on the apples of my cheeks and
I feel like when I'm more tan I have to
take a lot more product in order to give
myself the look that I'm going for so I
literally just keep going over the spots
where I want my blush to go until I have
the nice rosy glowy look that I'm going
for and then the next step I'm going to
be taking my Too Faced highlighter and
it is in the shade ray of light and I'm
gonna be using this fan brush right here
and I've been absolutely obsessed with
the fan brush I have never used one
before I got this brush set but now it's
like my new obsession I don't know how
I've been living without a fan brush and
so I'm just gonna lightly dab it in my
highlighter and then apply it right to
the tops of my cheekbones
just to give my face the natural glow
and I'm looking for look how blue it is
I love the way that it applies as well
just because it goes on so even and
doesn't look cakey at all so I'm just
gonna put some on the top of my nose and
then a little bit and then next because
you guys know I'm obsessed with having a
natural glow I always love my face looks
glowy I'm gonna go over with a second
highlighter and this one is the Laura
Geller highlighter in the shades got got
dialed glow I don't know if I'm saying
that right but I'm just gonna take the
same brush and then apply it directly
where I applied it before and then to
finish off the look I'm just gonna be
taking my fresh rose floral toner and
spraying this all over my face to kind
of like set my makeup and make sure the
powder stays in place since I did put
powder all over it I don't want it
moving I don't want it like coming off
easily so that is why it's really
important to set your face with a
setting spray and then to finish off the
look I'm gonna be using my absolute
favorite lip gloss of all time you guys
know I'm obsessed with this one it is
the NYX butter gloss in the shade
fortune cookie and I've been loving this
one for so long it's the perfect nude
color and it's honestly so gorgeous when
you have a nice tan so I've been loving
this on all of my trips lately I just
think that it adds such a natural Sheen
to your face
so that is the complete look I hope that
you guys enjoyed this video I know that
it was super simple and these products
are literally my favorite you can use
them at any time of year and this is
just my go-to look for the summer and
whenever I'm on a vacation where I just
want to wear minimal makeup and look
natural and glowy so I hope that you
guys enjoyed this video and thank you so
much for watching and I will see you in
my next one
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
