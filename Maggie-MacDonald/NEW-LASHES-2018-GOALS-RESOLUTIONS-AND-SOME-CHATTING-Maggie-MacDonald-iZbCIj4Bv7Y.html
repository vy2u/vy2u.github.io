heart and we all got the same bowl it's
called the Viet they have to go gummy a
spicy peanut sauce on it in peanuts and
like veggies and I got falafel but
tonight we're gonna get since I won 17
yo but it was closed so we like couldn't
come here
but I'm getting my lashes done I don't
know if you can see but I literally
don't have any
eyelash extensions on right now
so I'm going to go get them redone but
first bachelor shopping
but it's so we're that's not wearing any
like having eyelashes only bringing
about the era
but I literally need to literally open
so now I'm on my way to get my eyelashes
done and it's gonna take us five minutes
and yeah so it's really close yeah five
minutes together but it's really close
to where we were just eating lunch it is
in I think
Alston's I mean I would
concentrate yeah yeah it's like
brightener bu so it's in Ulsan and this
is the place that Gretchen gets her
alleged on that it's so cute and I saw
her vlog where she was getting them done
here and the place was literally like so
my aesthetic and everything then when I
was with her a couple weeks ago I looked
at her eyelashes and I was like I got
good like your eyelashes look so
good where do you get them done and she
told me I was like I need to go there so
I waited from buying to like come all
off well not completely out to kind of
take him off myself last night
and then you and then I like how to meet
had to make an appointment here at the
destination because they just look so
good and you guys are gonna be like oh
my god okay I need to give them done
with this place after you see it because
that's okay chocolatier and it is worth
a joke because we had to come to Boston
to do it which I mean it's 45 minutes
from my school and the other place I
went to was 40 minutes Jim
I hate wonders so much oh and one point
that I was talking about this morning
remember when we were in the kitchen and
I came downstairs and I just woke up but
I was literally crisp and fresh out of
bed and my eyelashes like obviously are
with this and they're not done and what
somebody some of them here and I was
like oh my god after having eyelash
extensions every single day since
October so October November December
like three months I've had eyelash
extensions
I looked naked eye looks like a little
boy and I was like I look so bad right
now and then it just made me realize
that like literally money can do
anything to make somebody look better
and it's a crazy to think of because
social media so unrealistic and you see
so many girls and they're like on the
beach and they have these really
beautiful tans and they have long
eyelashes and their lips are just full
and like they're so gorgeous and you're
like oh my god why do they look like
that chances are they paid a lot of
money they look like that it's not
natural because like I don't know just
feel like everybody has their natural
like no eyelashes and pale skin and
little things like that
and that's those lashes but so that's my
little rant I'm not really gonna go too
much into detail about that but yeah you
turn up now because I'm about to go into
my oh and I really love double or
nothing big shots level with so good you
guys follow my spawn high because it's
all the songs are on my Twitter I just
got done getting my lashes filled look
at them guys they are so soft and so
perfect
and Katherine did my lashes today and I
got them done at the wink lash bar and
it's in Boston look how cute this place
is the aesthetic if you really know me
you know that this place is so me I felt
like a princess when I came in here and
got my lashes done like look at the
hallway with all of the different like
offices or whatever you call them where
you get your lashes done they're all
down this hallway and I felt like a
princess cabanas I love that and you
walk down here and there's a bunch of
little pink doors with lashes on the
doors and they're so cutie and yeah so
this is it and then they have this wall
right here which is amazing and this
cute little say it with your eyes a
little same thing on the desk I think
it's so cute this place is so me you
