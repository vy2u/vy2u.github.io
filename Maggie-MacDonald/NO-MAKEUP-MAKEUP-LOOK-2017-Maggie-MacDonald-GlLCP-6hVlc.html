today's video I'm going to be showing
you this makeup look that I have right
here this is just my everyday makeup
look honestly it is a no makeup makeup
look this look is so perfect it honestly
makes your face just looks soft like and
the products that I have on my face
right now are all amazing products I
feel like honestly it's so weightless
and feels like there's nothing on my
face at all and before I started using
these products my face used to feel kind
of gross when I would put on makeup and
I just like never really liked it I felt
like after a few hours I always just
wanted to wash my face but honestly
after wearing this exact makeup for a
whole entire day probably like twelve
artistry it honestly still looks perfect
it looked perfect it felt perfect and
everything so I am so happy with this
look finally I feel like I can share a
look with you that I love and that just
like feels good on your skin and
honestly just look so natural so without
further ado let's get on into the video
and I hope you guys enjoy so before I do
any makeup on my face I'm gonna be using
my favorite product ever my holy grail
right now and that is the Fendi primer
so I'm just gonna put a pea-sized on my
finger and then moisturize that all over
my face and then next I'm gonna go in
with my fenty Beauty foundation and just
put a pump and a half of that on my hand
and then take my other finger and then
just put little dots all over my face to
apply my foundation before going in as
you can see with my dampened Beauty
Blender which is actually not a Beauty
Blender like the brand Beauty Blender
but it is a real techniques sponge and
honestly they are so much more
affordable and so much better a lot more
bigger and squishier so I highly
recommend using one of those and yeah so
basically as you can see I'm just trying
to blend that all into my face and on my
neck making sure that it just looks
really really even
next I'm going to be going in with my
matchstick concealer and that is in the
shade bamboo and it's also one of the
new fenty products and I'm going to be
applying that straight onto my face
under my eyes on my nose just in like
all the areas that are really high
points on my face and then again I'm
just going to be blending that all in
with my dampened Beauty sponge
next I am going to be using the
matchstick in the shade mocha and I'm
just going to be using that as my cream
contour and just putting that in all of
the places that I really want to define
on my face then again just using my
beauty sponge to blend all that in
really nicely I really like these
matchsticks right now like they're
really handy and I think that these are
one of my favorite products right now so
if you haven't tried them out i really
suggest that you do because they are
really amazing then i'm going to set my
face with my Laura Mercier powder and
I'm just gonna be using this big fluffy
brush to do so getting a little bit of
product on and then applying that under
my eyes and everywhere where I kind of
put all of that concealer just to make
sure that it's gonna stay all day and
just look really really really good in
natural then I'm gonna be going in with
my favorite hoola bronzer and I'm gonna
be taking how does this angled flap
brush and applying that to all the
places that I put the cream contour just
to define my face a little bit more and
add some extra warmth because when I
wear makeup I love it to be warm I love
to be glowy and look really natural so I
just feel like this bronzer is so
amazing I used to be obsessed with the
Too Faced chocolate bronzer but this one
is my new writer dye then I'm going to
be applying my favorite blush which is
the tarte clay blush in the shade
glisten and i'm just going to be
applying this to the apples of my cheeks
and really just warming everything up
and making me look more awake
then guys my favorite point of this
whole entire routine which is my
highlighter yes I have to be glowing all
the time and I'm just gonna be taking
this two-faced highlighter and applying
it to my cheekbones and the tip of my
nose and also on my Cupid's bow I love
looking glowy this is my favorite
product ever and I feel like it's just
so important in my makeup routine that
you get a good highlight in then I'm
just gonna be using this Maybelline
eyebrow pencil I honestly don't know
what I'm doing when I'm filling in my
eyebrows I just kind of go over the
places that look like they need a little
bit more love and then I'm gonna be
going in with my favorite Dior lash
primer and I'm just gonna be applying
this to my top lashes a little bit as
you can see right here this is just
gonna help your mascara from flaking and
honestly it really lengthens my
eyelashes so much it makes a huge
difference but then my favorite mascara
which is the L'Oreal telescopic if
you're an OG to my channel you know that
I'm obsessed with this I'm just gonna be
applying this to obviously my eyelashes
on the top and when I apply mascara I
honestly get it all over my eyelid as
you can see but I just feel like being
messy with it honestly just makes my
eyelashes look so much longer and so
much more full so what that is just what
I do when I apply my mascara
I just keep really going over it over
and over and over again and I kind of
look down a little bit use a small
mirror because I feel like it just helps
make them so much more longer and then
I'm just gonna put a little bit on the
bottoms there and then go in with
this your this I'm gonna take a q-tip
and get all of the mascara off of my
eyelid then I'm just gonna be putting on
my favorite chopstick which is the
vanilla being won by bird speeds it's my
absolute favorite right now and that is
my finished everyday no makeup makeup
look I hope you guys enjoyed this video
I just really wanted to create a makeup
look that was super natural yet super
glowy and I hope you guys enjoy this
video and I will see you in my next one
