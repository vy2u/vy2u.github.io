closet right now this is probably one of
the worst things I could have ever done
waited till last minute to pack for
Aruba so here we are my pack with me
video you guys really liked these when I
did it for Miami for spring break and
then when I went to Miami again and I
think I did one for Coachella too
yeah I did you guys like really like to
see how I pack what I pack how do I
organize a suitcase all of that so
that's what I'm gonna be doing this vlog
right now it's currently 10:00 p.m. and
we are leaving at 5 I am so bad on my
part to wait last-minute to pack for
uber but yes I'm going to Aruba I'm
gonna be gone from May 16th
Wednesday May 16th until Wednesday May
23rd and then I'm coming back two days
early because I'm going to post Malone
with Tyler so I also have to pack it
over for that which I don't know what
I'm going to wear for that so that's
gonna be hard you need to pack that as
well but right here at least to begin I
to begin that sounded kind of funny just
start off I have all of my bikinis in
this box right here that I'm bringing so
I'm gonna put those over on the side and
not some of the makeup I'm going to be
bringing to and it kind of like stresses
me out because my closet isn't fully
done yet so I just kind of have like
stuff everywhere but at least all my
clothes are like all laid out but
basically these are all the bikinis I'm
gonna be bringing I have a ton in here
just because I have I'm like really sick
right now and then really bad allergies
but um I have all these bikinis that I
just got that I'm gonna be doing like a
try on haul for you guys in a robot and
I want to show you all of my new bikini
so I'm gonna be packing so many of them
just because I know I'm gonna be living
in a bikini so that is what I'm gonna do
and usually before I go on a trip I like
to write down like every single day that
I'm gonna be gone and then put like what
I'm gonna need for each day I don't know
like how or if I could have done that
for this one because I really don't know
like anything that's planned for this
trip my dad kind of just
told em and I that we have like a bunch
of surprises and stuff but every morning
we're gonna wake up and probably like
work out eat breakfast and then go to
the beach I'm assuming so I need like
workout clothes bathing suits and
clothes to wear like out to dinner but I
don't know me tonight we're gonna like
go out to dinner or like fancy dinner
like I don't know what to pack lay it
all out with my packing cubes because
you guys know that I love packing cubes
and if you're new to my channel my name
is Maggie hi um I have like showed you
guys and all my other videos of me
packing near on trips I've used my
packing cubes and they're literally a
lifesaver I love them so much I'll have
them link down below for you guys um
they're from I think the brand Cal pack
I got mine at free people but I'll link
them below anyway I'm gonna start
packing all my stuff and like put it
into groups of what's gonna go in what
packing cube and like figure out what I
need to bring okay so I have an update
for my clothes finally I just got it all
packed it's like twelve o'clock right
now in this little packing cube thing
it's just the smallest one I have all of
my underwear and I need to put socks in
here too which just reminded me my socks
are up and this cubby in this limit bag
so I'm gonna bring a few pairs of socks
to work out in just to go with my
sneakers but I'll show you guys like
what I'm packing so far so I have my
Lululemon sportswear as I have a few of
them that are actually being hung to dry
right now because I just wash them so I
have three right here and then I have
two downstairs that I'm bringing but I'm
also bringing the lines and bringing in
the pink ones the periwinkle ones cobalt
blue I'm also bringing the green ones
I'm bringing a black pair of like
running material Lululemon's and then
these red ones just because I'm gonna be
running on the treadmill while I'm there
because like I've been running outside
lately so I wanna like stay in shape and
like keep my endurance up and then in
here I literally just have probably 20
bikinis but I'm not gonna show you guys
those right now because you'll probably
see them
in the haul video that I show you like
when I'm there I'm also like exhausted
right now so I'm sorry if I can't like
speak and in this packing cube right
here I just have some sleeping shirts a
sweatshirt yeah so basically it's like
five of Tyler's t-shirts in a sweatshirt
that I can sleep in and then this one
just has a bunch of dresses rompers tank
tops and two pairs of denim shorts one
pair of Levi's and one pair from
Reformation and then I'm bringing these
shoes right here my Gucci slides I'm
gonna bring these plain nude heels just
like the ankle strap ones with the block
heel they kind of got dirty from Tyler's
graduation so I'm going to see if I can
clean those up a little bit and then
we're gonna be bringing up my nmds and
also my APL sneakers so I can run in
them and then I'm bringing this bag
right here that I got from Urban just as
my beach bag and it's just a little
straw bag I'm gonna put all of my Sun
tanning lotions and stuff in there so
that's basically what I have packed
right now I don't think I'm bringing any
sunglasses because I have like these
cute like fashionable ones but these are
so not like a rubra vibes I'm gonna save
those when I go to Italy honestly when I
go on vacation I don't wear sunglasses
I'm assuring this Adm shirt with no
pants because it's so late and I need to
like get a move on and pack like finish
packing but whatever I guess I'm just
gonna not sleep and sleep on the plane
since it's a five-hour plane ride but
now I'm gonna start packing all of like
my toiletries and stuff and also I'm
just sitting on the ground in my closet
and it's really uncomfortable like this
rug is like itching my legs in it it
feels really really strange but I got
like a ton of little small toiletries I
just showed you guys
I'm and I went to the store and bring
those I have like a little eyelash
whatever those things are called from
when I went to Coachella I'm gonna still
keep those way I'm so done I was like I
really need a mini toothpaste like
that's why I went to the store to buy a
mini tube facing gets a guess what the
first thing that I saw in my toiletry
bag this is the first thing I saw these
are just some of the toiletries that I
bring and I put them in like this little
Lululemon bag thing that I've had
forever so I just have some cotton pads
my Jergens lotion in a little trouble
container I have a dove deodorant my
eyelash extension cleaner some shampoo
and conditioner three tubes of
toothpaste as we already know wait oh my
god I need my razor that's what I need
okay and then I have some moisturizer
some hair detangler and I think that's
it I'm gonna bring in then to have my
suntan lotion in this big bag right here
and I'm gonna put makeup in this bag but
I need to go through this is what I have
to go through okay I'm gonna bring my
brush obviously those weight em are you
bringing makeup wipes nevermind I
actually need those for after the trip
so I never write my razor I'm gonna go
in there and I'll bring an extra little
razor head do I need anything else maybe
I'll bring these Paul Mitchell shampoos
too as you guys can see I hate throwing
away because I really pack so much oh my
god my face wash oh god I hate going
somewhere because
always overpack flossers I'm like yeah I
need everything and then use all just
like my full-size toiletries that I'm
not gonna bring ok so now I think I'm
gonna pack some makeup in this bag right
here ok
update so I've moved everything from the
floor of my closet well this stuff I
still need to pack we'll talk about that
in like two seconds so I moved it all to
my suitcase and all my packing cubes are
like kind of packed in on that side and
that's just like Lululemon clothes that
I'm gonna put more in like I told you
guys they're being washed socks
underwear that stuff is gonna go on the
top my beach bag makeup wipes tampons
cuz I think I'm gonna get my period and
like wicked bloated and like don't feel
good but anyway and then all of my shoes
and stuff are on this side so I'm gonna
pack everything in there and then once I
like zip this up I'm gonna put all of
the like Sun tanning lotion stuff in
here and then I'm a speaker in there and
then whatever else I have in here
honestly
like actually I'm gonna probably pack my
camera charger and my tripod just cuz I
don't need those like when I'm on the
plane and then I'm gonna pack that stuff
my suitcase um this probably I'll put my
carry-on and then in here I just have a
bunch of like travel carry-on items that
I think I'm gonna bring and I'll
actually do a separate video of like
what's in my carry-on or maybe I'll just
show you right now whatever I'll just
show you now so I think I'm gonna bring
my little black Gucci backpack as my
carry-on yeah I think I'm gonna bring
this is my carry-on and then inside I
just have my passport
a bunch of chopsticks like probably six
I have some white just like nature's
promised wipes for like my face or my
hands or whatever um see all the
chopsticks on the bottom I have those I
have my wallet with my apartment keys
that I'm gonna need when I come back

up and then we're gonna be going back to
my apartment and then I have a hair
elastic a bunch of chopsticks like I
just said 16 times and ear pods pocket
gum
and we're gonna put all this stuff like
neatly into here just because I'm gonna
be using this as my carry-on actually
everything fits perfectly and then I'm
gonna hold my computer so I can use it

there's like a couple things that I was
going to look through this is from
Coachella earplugs I don't need those I
listen to music on the plane chopstick I
don't mean that I have 17 chopsticks

morning and I really need to go to bed
right now because it's like 1 o'clock I
need to be up in like 3 hours to go to
the airport

and then we'll have like the rest of the
day to like do stuff and like go on the
beach in like lay but I'm exhausted
