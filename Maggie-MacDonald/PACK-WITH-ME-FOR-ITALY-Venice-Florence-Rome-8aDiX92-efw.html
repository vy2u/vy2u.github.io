see it
it's mini my big ones that might cause
it but say hi to the pack with me vlog
tell them where we're going so guys I
have another packing vlog for you I'm
packing to go to Italy and I'm really
not smart because it is 9 o'clock on
Thursday night and I leave Friday
morning I'm gonna leave at 9 o'clock
tomorrow morning to go drive to my
apartment and then take the train from
my apartment into Boston we're like
Gretchen's gonna pick me up and then
we're going to go to the airport but you
guys love like the packing vlog so I
just thought that I would do another one
and a lot of you guys have been
messaging me and certain being like oh
like are you doing a pact with me for
Europe and of course I am
so I just like to show you guys this is
what I've got done today so far so what
I decided to do for this trip since we
have so many different things going on
is I just like try it on my outfits and
then laid them out on the ground so I
have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 an
extra shirt a pair of shoes so I have
all this stuff so far and obviously
that's my suitcase right there so I'm
gonna got some workout clothes and like
sleeping clothes and show you guys what
my closet looks like it's literally a
mess right now
it's so bad so I took like all my
clothes off the ground here and I moved
them into the room but I have all of my
toiletries packed
luckily I'll show you guys what is in
here so I just have this clear case
which is from Madewell
and I'll have a link down below for you
guys just because I know a lot of you
guys are probably gonna be asking me and
it holds a lot of stuff surprisingly so
this is what I have in my travel
toiletry case usually I just pack some
sort of wipes and I've been loving the
beauty 360 micellar cleansing wipes so I
have those and I also have these CFL
gentle skin funds or wipes and then I
just got some advil today and I got all
of the travel sized stuff just because
it's so much easier when you're
traveling obviously to get the travel
sized ones just because your bag won't
weigh as more even if I do put this in
my checked bag but I probably will end
up bringing a carry-on and putting it in
there just because my flights so long
I'm gonna be traveling for so long that
I want to like wash my face and stuff
before I get on my second flight and
that I got cotton swabs I got a brand
new toothbrush with one of these little
things to go over the bristles but I
just use the oral-b
one that vibrates and then this is my
lash splash which I actually have to put
in a ziploc bag because it'll like go
everywhere on the plane then I got a
toothpaste and I like these ones better
than the mini ones because the mini one
is probably like half of this I feel
like I can use it like twice so I got
this bigger one in its Colgate I don't
really care what you kind of toothpaste
I use I just kind of got a random one
and then I have my moisturizer which is
the Neutrogena oil-free moisturizer and
then these are some flossers my favorite
deodorant the Dove cucumber one my
favorites eatable gentle skin cleanser
some tums in case I get a stomach ache
from eating all the pasta cheese red
wine etc and then I got these travel
sized shampoo and conditioner and
therefore hair that's like fine like
mine and that wants to be like volume
eyes I don't know if you guys can see
it's like not folk
saying but it's called apothecary
essentials and it's just like volume
shampoo and conditioner and wait it's
actually good that I cleaned this out
because I have to go fill this with
witch hazel it's just a little
travel-size thing of what hazel these
are my eyelash spool ease and I actually
should put some more of my Jergens
lotion in there you guys know that I
don't wear a ton of makeup so I just
packed all of my makeup in this pin Rose
holographic case that I got from
Coachella so I have my makeup brushes my
powder brush my bronzer brush blush
brush highlight brush and I'm only
bringing these three I mean four and
then I'm bringing my laura geller
highlighter which is my fave and then
they've also been loving the benefit
Watts up highlighter if you guys saw in
probably my vlog is gonna go up before
this video so I like showed a little
makeup routine ideas all these products
I'll have a link down below to face
chocolate bronzer and I also just
recently got this one I think it's
called a honey bun
honey bun honey bunny Sun bunny honey
bum but yeah that's what it looks like I
haven't used it before but I'm really
excited to use that and then I'm packing
my NYX butter gloss in fortune cookie
and I'm packing this red one this glossy
a lip gloss and this Tarte blush so I'm
really not bringing that much makeup
just because I don't know makeup anyway
in my past few videos in my um what's in
my bag video and then also myself I'll
haul video which you guys will see I'm
not wearing any makeup
other than those products and you guys
were all complimenting how good I looked
or like how glowy my skin looked so
these products are definitely working
they're my favorite right now another
thing that I forgot that I needed to
pack was my loving tan just because I
don't know I feel like I'm gonna get
kind of pale when I'm there cuz I
haven't really been out in the Sun
recently so I'm gonna pack my loving tan
at my
I'll have these linked down below
usually I link my self-tanner in all my
videos just because a lot of you guys
are always asking me what I use and I
use loving tan that deluxe bronzing
mousse in the shade dark so I'm gonna
bring this I don't know if I should
bring the bronze shimmer I don't know if
I'll wear this you know what I don't
need it okay so this is what I have so
far and I've been reading Steve on
AILA's post on her blog about what she
packs when she goes on an international
trip and it really helped me a lot but
like for me I'm such an over-packer like
I don't know what to do but I also have
to remember that obviously I'm gonna be
with Gretchen so like if I do need
anything I have her which is good so
that makes me not want to pack like some
of this stuff just because I have so
much stuff I'm like worried but I don't
know if I should pack these black heels
because I really wanna wear them with
this dress on the last night this black
dress with those black heels but maybe I
should just bring these one this one
pair of heel right here but I don't know
what you do cuz like I really don't know
what else I'm gonna wear with these
black heels you know what I'm not
bringing these
everything the best as I can into my
packing cubes so now I kind of like
categorize everything so I have three
rompers three dresses three skirts a
bunch of body suits and tops that can go
with my one pair of shorts that I'm
bringing and these are just by
Reformation and then I'm bringing my
made well perfect summer jeans and these
have no rips in them I just feel like
for this trip I'm gonna go with like the
no rips look and they're just light wash
and then I have three pairs of pants
right here and I don't know if I'm going
to be wearing like different outfits
during the day and different know if
it's at night so this is just all that
I'm bringing and then I have this cute
little scarf top and then also this
jumpsuit which is going to be really
cute that's from Free People and then I
just have some of my come for your
clothes over there and yeah so now I'm
gonna put all these into my packing
cubes and pray that all of it fits
Russ's and robbers and skirts
successfully fit into this cube and I
typically like roll up all of my items
just so they aren't like wrinkly and it
maximizes the amount of space that you
have okay last but not least I have all
my comfy traveling clothes sleeping
shirts underneath and then all of my
workout clothes I'm just bringing
spandex and sports bras but everything
else fit perfectly
so I'm basically all packed and these
are the only shoes that I'm gonna bring
with me these sneakers I'm gonna wear
during the day these are just plain
Pumas and then I have enemies to work
out in some tory burch sandals which are
such throwbacks but they really like go
with everything and they're super
comfortable and then I'm also bringing
these see by Chloe heels just for dinner
and stuff like that but this is what my
suitcase looks like everything's
completely organized and then right here
I just have like sunglasses my sticky
bra I'm gonna put all of my shoes in
here and then I think I'm gonna bring my
toiletries with me in my carry-on I'll
just show you guys I honestly think I'm
gonna bring my Louie Vuitton duffel bag
with like an extra sweatshirt some
underwear that you guys like don't need
to see I'm also gonna bring my white
Gucci bag my backpack and then I have my
planner that I bring with me everywhere
and then in this at least I can keep
like my laptop my chargers everything
I'm going to need since I'm gonna be
traveling for so long and then I'm just
gonna bring all my toiletries with me in
here so I'm gonna pack all the rest of
the stuff now and I literally look
disgusting so I'm not even gonna show
myself I'm just gonna end off a video
here and I hope you guys enjoyed it and
yeah I can't wait for you guys to see
all the vlogs from Italy I'm so excited

be so much fun I'm so excited but I
really need to get to bed right now
