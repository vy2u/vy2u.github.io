we're leaving for spring break and
Kayleen are packing right now and I feel
like this happens to me every single
time I go on a trip I try to pack my
stuff and I'm like oh like I have enough
stuff like I know what exactly what I'm
bringing and then I go to pack and I'm
like I literally don't have anything at
all and I feel like I need to bring so
much stuff just because I feel like I
don't have anything when really I'm
gonna get there and then not end up
wearing anything that I originally
brought and like wanted to wear so this
is what my room looks like right now
it's completely a mess I have all of my
bathing suits right here that I have to
go through this is my empty suitcase
those are all of my shorts the one pair
of shoes I'm gonna bring because I
realized that since I've been traveling
so much
you don't wear like most of the stuff
that you bring so I was like you know
what I'm just gonna bring these because
they're really a staple in your closet
and I just got these from Nordstrom
they're these plain tan heels and then
on my bed I just have all of the things
that I think I should bring with me
right here I just have all of these
pants beach pants and stuff I have a
romper from Urban Outfitters I have a
couple tank tops right here to wear with
like jean shorts and sandals what is
this oh this is that ASOS dress that I
showed you guys recently in a vlog it's
just like this sheer beach cover-up
dress my Dida's bodysuit that I haven't
worn yet I feel like that'll be cute to
wear like when I'm walking around at
night exploring the city or something I
have no idea and then I just have these
little short so I'm forever 21 that look
cute with like a little tank top if I'm
chillin this is a pile of all of my
basic tank tops you guys know I'm
obsessed with them so I was like you
know what I need to just bring a bunch
of them because I know I'm gonna be
wearing them a lot and then right here I
have my SoulCycle leggings for if I go
to a SoulCycle class a few pairs
outlines some sports bras a little skirt
over there and some t-shirts to sleep in
and then also I have these new cool
packing cubes that I just got online and
I see a lot of people using these when
they're packing for a trip so I was like
you know what I'm gonna see if I can use
those too I feel like they'll be really
helpful for me just to keep all of my
stuff organized
and then over here I have a bunch of
like accessories and things that I need
to remember to pack with me like my
favorite face mask that I've been loving
I have this little Mario Badescu
travel-size cucumber aloe like facial
spray and I feel like that'll feel good
on my face like after I'm in the Sun and
then spraying it on just cuz as aloe in
it on my little travel-size vanilla
perfume you guys know I love a little
headband and some hair elastics for when
you do face masks I have my two pairs of
sunglasses that I always wear my
ray-bans and then my YSL ones and then
these ones right here are just fun ones
that I thought it would be cool to like
take I think pictures in so I'm also
gonna be packing those up I really need
to remember to bring all of my filming
stuff I'm gonna bring my little tripod
and then also my battery charger that
would stink if I forgot that for that
stuff
accessories my toiletries that I'm gonna
pack later water bottle so now I'm gonna
go through all my bathing suits and like
decide which ones I'm gonna bring with
me so I got this one from Billabong that
I already showed you guys in a vlog I
think I'm just gonna bring it to see if
it works out while I'm there but I just
feel like this color is not gonna look
good on me and if I don't end up wearing
it all just return it so I'm definitely
gonna be bringing that since I just got
it and then I also just got this black
one from Billabong and I'm gonna bring
also in this black one from Billabong
with two different bottoms wait this red
ones cute I just got this one I bring
that I'm gonna bring this I have never
worn this I got this for California
California was so long ago but I got
this little string one from PacSun I'll
see if that looks cute eventually I
really don't really like the color now
that I'm looking at it but we'll see if
we can make it work
this little tan one from Molly J swim
and I have a code for you guys I can
leave it down below if you guys want to
check out our bathing suits what is this
that's definitely a tag so it has this
little top that I'm gonna bring that one
this new one that I just got from zafo
saffle bathing suits look so bad on me
but I'm gonna bring this one anyway oh
my god this is the bathing suit I wore
in California you guys know I love this
one I wore it in so many pictures so I
probably shouldn't bring it with me now
just because I've worn it so much but I
really like it I really like the way
that the bottoms fit and I can't find
them I'm gonna bring it you know what
just in case
this is cute okay so I'm bringing this
white one as well oh my god I love this
green Billabong one I think I'm never
gonna wear it just cuz I've had it for
so long okay so I now I need to get all
my stuff in my packing cube get ready to
go do some last-minute errands and stuff
but I discovered this energy drink that
I'm drinking right now because I already
just had coffee earlier so now I'm gonna
drink this and it's called for purpose
energy and it's an organic energy drink
and this one's in the flavor raspberry
pomegranate and I found out that they
donate 10 cents from every cancelled to
building schools to the developing world
for children in need so I will leave a
link to for purpose energy down below
for you guys so now I need to get all
this stuff in just my packing cubes and
let's see how that works out I'm like
kind of nervous because I don't know
which ones I should put certain things
in so I'm finally all packed and I'm
getting ready to go to the gym now but I
just want to show you guys what the
packing cubes ended up looking like once
they were all packed up this one right
here has all of my like shirts and tank
tops in it and then this one has my
bathing suits this one is my pants and
shorts and skirts and a few rompers this
one has all of my workout clothes and
then this one right here has all of my
like underwear and socks and stuff like
that so I have to put all of those into
my suitcase right here and then I have
all of my accessories up there and then
just little extra things that I'm going
to need to end up packing but I think
I'm just gonna bring my adidas sides and
then these nmds and also those shoes
right there because I feel like I don't
know I feel like I literally
I don't know what else I would wear
other than those so I'm gonna go to the
gym right now but I just wanted to
enough this vlog here and not keep it
super long because I'm going to be
vlogging every single day when I'm in
Miami on spring break and I am leaving
tomorrow so starting tomorrow and we'll
have vlogs up every day I hope that you
guys enjoyed this video and I will see
you guys in my next one I just want to
show you guys the packing cubes when
they're in my suitcase because oh my god
if this isn't like so satisfying and I
don't even know all my clothes are all
packed up and ready they're so organized
and I'm so happy cuz usually I just like
throw all my clothes in and they end up
getting over and clean like messed up
and mixed up and I don't know where my
pants are where my skirts are where my
shirts are all that so yeah I'm just
really really happy with the way that
these came out I'll have them linked
