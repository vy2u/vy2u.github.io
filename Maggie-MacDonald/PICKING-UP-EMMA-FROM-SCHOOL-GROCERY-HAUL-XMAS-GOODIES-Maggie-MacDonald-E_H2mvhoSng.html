gonna go pick up Emma from school we
have so much to do today
it's crazy that it's literally the 21st
of December and December is almost over
it's almost Christmas
it's insane I'm finally done with school
I am home for break and I could not be
happier so I'm going to pick up Emma
from school right now and then we have a
bunch of errands to run and I just
thought that it would be fun to bring
you guys along with me and outfit of the
day
Emma's brandy melville little cropped
hoodie my navy blue lines and then
Emma's baby blue Adidas nmds I'm so
obsessed with them I need them for me
too because I know that she gets annoyed
when I wear her stuff but like she wears
my stuff too so that's what happens when
you have a sister so anyway I'm gonna go
downstairs I'm gonna get all my stuff
ready and then you go pick up Emma so
yeah let's go I'm super staticky right
now and then I just got our fave coffees
we drove all the way from our town to
town how many times over is this to two
times over to get our favorite coffee
from Mary Lou's black toasted almond
these are the ones that I usually get
when I'm at school and I literally
haven't Mary Lou's right next to my
apartment like I can walk there and it
would take me two minutes
but yeah I'm like having a withdrawal so
we had to go get them before anything
I'm gonna mind just like spilled on my
leg um and I have had to do some of the
air and stay for our mom but we
literally just been sitting in the car
in the parking lot a lady right here so
the lighting is so good so that's what
we're doing but we really should go in
right now and like start grocery
shopping we had to get that sweater
though what I don't go in just yet
and I wonder when because I'm gonna be
cool we literally have no food at our
house so this will be like the ultimate
grocery haul like we don't have anything
like theirs they will show them out the
fridge when we get home there's
literally nothing in it because our
kitchen just got redone so we literally
don't have any like spices and stuff we
don't have nothing we don't have like
anything in our Oh them all away yeah
Wow we have to buy everything new Wow
we're gonna get boxes of the candy cane
little Oreo cookie things from Trader
Joe's because we want on underneath and
put in the cart just because like no
just keep it on it's for warmth look at
my shoes so cold my Akili sweatshirt in
my car but like it's like cut on the top
so it doesn't look good but who cares
and so we're gonna get boxes are those
and then put them in their little jar

picked these out I think that these are
so cute these little Christmas cards
they have saved on them and they say
