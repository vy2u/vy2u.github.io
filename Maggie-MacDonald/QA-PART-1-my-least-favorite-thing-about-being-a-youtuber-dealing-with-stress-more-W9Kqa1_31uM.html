right when I sit down and I get like the
lighting in the camera all set up I
forget the one thing that I need for
this video okay so in today's video um I
don't know like I'm not gonna do a like
intro that I would do for like a
sit-down video or anything like that
it's just like a really chill video and
I'm gonna answer all you guys's
questions you guys asked me on my
Instagram like a ton of questions on my
last picture and I have so many good
ones so I feel like I'm gonna split this
video up into like a bunch of different
parts like I did with my last QA just
because I have so many good questions I
really want to answer all them for you
guys just to answer like all of the
stuff you guys are wondering obviously
like that's what a QA is but I feel like
I get along with the same questions so
that's I won't do these videos just you
guys like get to know me a little bit
better and stuff like that yeah so like
I was saying I told you guys to ask me
questions on my last Instagram picture
and if you guys aren't following me on
Instagram I will have a link in the
description box down below so you guys
can follow me I'm really personal on my
Instagram I'm always posting like what
I'm doing I post so many pictures on
there and also my snapchat and I will
have that linked down below as well and
so without further ado let's get started
okay so look here are the questions that
I'm gonna be answering in today's video
they're all just favorited at the top of
my photo I wanted to like make sure I
answered like the best ones first if
that makes any sense
so I favorited those ones and I have
them at the top just so it's super easy
for me to like go through and quickly
answer so the first question is I get
this question so much and this was one
of the most popular ones on my photo and
actually got 49 links on it so that is
how did you meet Tyler and how long have
you guys been dating also when will he
be in a video and so I met Tyler my
freshman year of college and I go to
Bridgewater State University for anybody
who was wondering and I'm sorting mark
I'm a junior but I met Tyler my freshman
year and it was the last night of
freshman year like that you could ever
like go well like it was the last day of
the semester was right before finals
like everyone was getting ready to like
go home and stuff and I remember I went
out to a party with my roommate Amanda
and we went to like the football house
and that's like where all the kids on
the football team lived and like when so
it was basically like the whole football
team and he was on the football team and
I knew like a couple of kids on the team
but I didn't know him and that was so
weird because I remember being out like
seeing him and I was like who is that
and I asked everyone and I was like
who's that boy he's so cute
and she was like oh that's Tyler like
you don't know him and I was like no I
don't know him that's so weird and then
like I talked to him that night and but
I had a boyfriend like of three years
that I was dating since high school so
he knew that also that's why he like
didn't come up to me like didn't say
anything and he respected that I had a
boyfriend which I really liked when like
him and I started talking and stuff so
then my boyfriend
and I of three years broke up because he
ended up cheating on me and like I was
gonna transfer to a school and like it
was this whole big thing that is like
for a different video and Emma
Chamberlain and like all the girls that
I was with at Coachella they were like
Maggie you literally need to do a story
time video about that because that's
crazy cuz I told her the story but
anyways aside from that I met Tyler and
then after that I like he knew I had a
boyfriend I was gonna transfer to his
school he cheated on me I didn't end up
going so he found out he added me on
snapchat and then him and I were like
stop chatting all summer and then the
first night back just school like when I
came early for field hockey and he came
early for football
he asked me on a date again I secured
you and you guys know I love ice cream
so I was like of course like I went and
then that was that so that is how we met
there's like more to the story but maybe
he'll say in the video once and I don't
know but also the second part of that
question is
when will he be in a video and also how
long we've been dating I'm sorry the
trains going by how long we have been
dating so we dated for we were like
together for a year and then we ended up
breaking up and now we're back together
so I really don't know like I've liked
him for two years like really ever since
I met him I have like really liked him
so yeah and also like when will he be in
a video I don't really know when he's
going to be in a video I kind of want to
keep like my relationship private like
I'm not gonna force him to be in a video
or like shove the camera in his face and
be like come on like be in my vlog but I
don't know whenever like he feels
comfortable whenever the time is right
he'll be in a video
but speaking of Tyler I've been meaning
to say this in like one of my most
recent like vlogs that have done but
I've just forgotten Tyler's brother and
his boyfriend actually started a vlog
channel so I'll have their channel link
down below you guys should check about
they are literally the cutest couple in
the whole entire world I'm obsessed with
them and I can't wait ain't go with them
and fought with them so you guys can go
subscribe to towers brothers channel
like maybe Tyler will be in his video
sometime I don't really know okay next
question any plans about grad school or
are you just gonna do YouTube full-time
when you graduate and right now I really
don't know what I'm gonna do when I
graduate that is a year from now and
like me thinking back to a year ago from
like this time it's completely different
so I have no idea what can happen but my
plan is to just keep doing YouTube I
love it I feel like I'm just getting
started
with YouTube and it's been like so great
so far so I'm definitely gonna keep
doing YouTube next question favorite
class you've taken in college my
favorite class that I've ever taken in
college my marketing class last year
spring semester I think it was like
intro to marketing and it was one of the
first marketing classes I ever took but
I liked it so much because I honestly
just really liked my teacher who taught
the class and I feel like he was really
chill and nice and like I got along with
him well so that was probably my
favorite class and he like taught us
interesting things that like actually
have
like meaning and like had anything to do
with like the world it wasn't just like
from a textbook like reading off slides
like he actually taught us stuff and I
really liked that okay next question
what is your dream job and I really like
to this question and it looked kind of
make me emotional thinking about it
because honestly my dream job is to do
what I do now like I had always watched
people on YouTube like I have like loved
it and so to be able to have the
opportunity to do exactly like what I've
always wanted to do is the coolest thing
ever and I never take it for granted and
I'm just so thankful for it every single
day and I'm thankful for each and every
one of you guys and I don't know I just
like love it so much being able to do
something and like help people and
inspire them is just one of the greatest
feelings ever next question what is the
scariest moment of your life love you
Maggie love you too and the scariest
moment of my life ever was probably when
I got in a car accident last year so
January 2017 I got into a car accident
and I totaled my car and it was the
scariest thing that I have like ever
experienced ever and I wasn't on my
phone I wasn't distracted I wasn't doing
anything like that which like you guys
shouldn't go on your phone while driving
like don't vlog and drive don't text and
drive
snapchat and drive none of that and I
like wasn't doing any of that it just
was like a freak like accident that
happened maybe I'll do his storytime
about it or like tell it on a different
time just because I don't want to take
up all of my time talking about my car
accident in this Q&amp;amp;A video but yes I was
probably the scariest moment of my life
what is your favorite part about
SoulCycle my favorite part about
SoulCycle is definitely like the
atmosphere and music and how it's like
very active and you always have to be
like engaged with like the instructor
and the music and the beat and the
movements and everything I feel like for
myself like I can't sit still I'm always
like running around like doing 50
million things at once so SoulCycle is
like the best way to work out for me
like I love it so much I feel like it
really like maximizes my work out
I don't know I just feel like it's a
different experience like if you guys
have ever gone to SoulCycle comment down
below if you feel the same way I just
feel like once I go and like refreshes
me like enlightens you about life I
don't really know next question how did
you meet Arlen and Gretchen I met Arlen
from high school I've known Arlen since
like seventh or eighth grade we played
hockey together which is so funny I'm
wearing a sweater right now
that's so weird to think about that like
we went to the same high school we grew
up and have the same friends and we like
we're friends but now we're even closer
than we were before like Arlen and I
have gotten so close in the past year
like closer than we've ever been
throughout the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 like 8
years I've known him and also I met
Gretchen through Arlen Arlen asked me
last year to do a photo shoot with him
and this boy Dylan in Boston and he was
like oh should come to Boston we can do
a shoot like it'll be so much fun I was
like oh yeah definitely like I'm not
doing anything so I went and Arlen was
like all like this is Gretchen she like
goes to BU she does YouTube and
literally Gretchen and I clicked
instantly like we were best friends ever
since
what is one beauty product that you
could not live without
honestly chapstick I don't think I could
ever live without chapstick but if we're
talking about makeup
probably bronzer I would definitely
choose bronzer like over anything if I
could only wear one makeup product
yeah definitely bronzer oh this one's
cute how did you and Emma stay so close
even though you don't live it together
anymore honestly when I stopped living
at home and I went to college is when
Emma and I became the closest and it's
because we FaceTime so much and we do
hang out a lot so I feel like just
keeping that connection with somebody
like when you're apart from them it's
gonna make it even closer like being on
FaceTime with her for a couple minutes
every single day we get to catch up
about our day we get to like talk about
everything it feels like we're really
hanging out so I feel like that is how
we stay so close even though we don't
live together I also love this question
what is the best thing about being a
youtuber the best thing about being a
youtuber honestly is being able to do
what I love and enjoy doing it
the same time do what I love and enjoy
doing it yeah and being able to like
connect with you guys and like build
relationships and friendships and meet
so many people have so many amazing
opportunities and like be able to just
do what I love and I don't know I just
like love and I love being it was like
help you guys like I was saying before
and like inspire you and just like be
there for you guys like I get so many
messages on Instagram about how like my
videos help you guys whether it be like
to help you start a healthy lifestyle or
help you like not be as stressed anymore
and like I just love being able to do
that so that's probably one of my
favorite things about being a youtuber
how has YouTube positively positively
affected your life and has it affected
your life negatively at all its
positively affected my life that sounds
weird positively you know when you say
word and see it and it like sounds weird
your head and when you say it allows
sounds even weirder I don't know so I
think YouTube has positively affected my
life in so many ways literally every
single aspect I think it's made me a
better person it's made me like
appreciate things more and like I don't
know just so many things I feeling I've
already explained in this video like why
I love YouTube and something negative
about YouTube there was something that I
wanted to say now I forget oh my god I
literally can't remember what it is
maybe it wasn't that important it wasn't
that negative and YouTube has nothing
negative about it oh now I remember the
most negative thing about YouTube is I
think probably would have to be the
comments and like I don't read the hate
comments or like let them really get to
me but I just think like I don't know I
just don't like it like that's so rude
because if you're sitting watching one
of my videos and you like want to
comment something like mean about it
think about what that's gonna do to like
the person you're commenting about it
doesn't have to be me at like I know a
ton of people got hate comments on their
videos but it's just like I don't like
that think about the other person
because like I'm a real person just like
you guys are I was like once in your
position watching somebody else's videos
I still watch other people's videos so I
just feel like I don't know I just like
don't like that I don't like negativity
I don't like mean people I don't like
talking bad about anybody
that's know this question was funny what
is your favorite muscle group to work
out I don't know if it makes sense lol
like apps legs butt arms honestly I love
ABS and everybody keeps asking me like
if I do any butt workouts or like squats
or anything or lift weights and I don't
I don't do anything it's just genetics
and like that's the way that I was born
so yeah oh this is a good one what is
the best and worst thing about Coachella
the best thing about Coachella
definitely is the music the food the
music of the food probably the best
things about Coachella and the worst
things about Coachella um honestly like
how sick I felt after everybody's always
like oh my god you're gonna feel so sick
like the dust is gonna get in your nose
and like in your sinuses and like you're
gonna be coughing and I was like not
like I'm gonna be fine I woke up the
last morning and I was like oh my god I
don't even know what hit me but like I
was so sick and then literally the week
after I got back from Coachella you guys
remember cuz like I haven't been posting
I was so sick and I would lay in my bed
and just like sleep all day because I
was so sick and like so drained from
everything and it was just like the
traveling the dust staying up late the
time change like all of that all in one
my immune system like crashed and I got
so sick favorite summertime memory and
this is really cute my favorite
summertime memory is the last summer
well I literally worked every single day
last summer I would work six days a week
at my hostessing job and I would work
from like 10:00 in the morning until
like 10:00 at night I'm not even kidding
or I'd work 9:00 to 11:00
no not 9:00 to 11:00 11:00 to 9:00 I'd
work 11:00 tonight so I had the craziest
hours and work like over 50 hours a week
and then I would babysit on my one day
off so at the end of the summer I was
like whatever I have a few days left I
don't care if I wake up early I don't
care like what I do and I was like I'm
going into work at 11:00 I need to do
something before and arlynn slept over
my house and me I'm in Arlen or Emma
Arlen and I went to the sunrise and we
like took photos and Emma took a bunch
of videos with Arlen I'll leave all
those videos linked down below and we
did like a bunch of q and A's and stuff
and he gave me my first 8 a.m.
sweatshirt and we watch the Sun Rise
it was just so much fun and it was like
before any of us really actually started
doing YouTube while Ireland kind of had
but it was just like right at the
beginning of all of it like I'm an
island just met and like our friendships
were all like coming together and
forming and like I don't know looking
back on that moment and like that memory
it's one of my favorites about last
summer my leg is falling asleep oh my
god it literally has like pins a needle
in it
ow next question how to be content with
breakups because of college slash
growing up with little fun emoji how to
be content with breakups because of
college and growing up honestly the
easiest way to put it is that you and
whoever you're with are gonna end up
growing so much in college like I am not
the same person as I was when I went
into college I'm not the same person as
I was a month ago I'm not the same
person as it was a year ago I just feel
like you grow so much as a person and
like to be alone in college just start
off is okay because you're gonna be so
busy you're gonna be going on with your
friends you're gonna be meeting so many
new people you're gonna be like going
out and like experiencing things and
being on your own for once and to not be
in a relationship and to be completely
alone and learn to love yourself when
you're alone and when you're not in a
relationship we don't have like a
girlfriend or boyfriend I just think
that that's so important and I don't
know you can end up missing out on a lot
of things not necessarily saying that
you should like never have a boyfriend
going into college I did in my freshman
year I do regret not going out as much
and not meeting as many people just
because I had a boyfriend I feel like
that I let that hold me back but that's
not the case for everybody like
obviously everybody has different
experiences but just for me I feel like
I let it hold me back and that's
nobody's fault but my own so I just feel
like if you are sad about your boyfriend
and you're breaking up if you're going
to college just try not to worry about
it that much because if it's meant to be
it'll be and you guys will go back
together eventually
but just like experienced college alone
for a little while at least and see what
it's like because I promise you if
you're meant to be with that person you
guys will make your way back together
and everything will be fine but yeah
is my advice for you oh this question is
really good and also really important
how do you deal with anxiety and stress
love you so so so so much I love you too
and honestly I have had a lot of stress
and anxiety this past like semester of
school ever since January as you guys
know I haven't really talked about it
like openly in any videos I kind of like
briefly talked about it a long time ago
but nothing's really been like brought
up about it since but this semester has
been insane for me like I took five
classes I did full time YouTube my
parents recently just got divorced over
the winter so it was like all that in my
life happened at once and at in that
point I was like so stressed out and I
didn't know what to do like I didn't
know how to deal with it I would be so
stressed every single day to the point
where like I felt like I couldn't do
anything because I was so stressed but
the way that I dealt with it was I hung
with my friends a lot and I also talked
to people because I feel like talking to
people can help just because like it'll
make you feel better about yourself like
don't keep anything inside so always
talking to people was also a good thing
and working out helped me a lot I know
like if I was really stressed a bit I
could I need to go to a SoulCycle class
I'd go to the class I'd feel so much
better after making YouTube videos
helped me like hanging out with friends
all that stuff will help and I promise
you that the feeling that you're feeling
if you're like stressed or anxious or
anything like that like it will pass you
will get better and honestly like you're
not alone everybody goes through it in
their life like everybody has stress and
everybody like gets anxiety not saying
like it's severe anything but like I
felt like that before like I've had
anxiety attacks but I haven't been like
diagnosed with anxiety but it is a real
thing and a lot of people do go through
it so don't feel bad if you are
stressing or like a feeling like you're
anxiety it's nothing to be ashamed about
literally everybody goes through it it's
so normal and yeah I don't know just
like we talk to your friends and hang
out with them and talk to them talk to
your parents you talk to literally
anybody you can talk to me if you need
help literally send me a DM on Instagram
and I would love to help you okay I'm
gonna do this question to end off this
video because I've been talking for so
long I knew you guys like long video
so so I'm gonna save all the rest of the
other ones for another video just
because this is getting really really
long and we just said that
but last question what inspires you the
most anything about that for a second
what inspires me the most I don't really
know how to worry this but probably the
fact that life is so like crazy and
there's so many possibilities and
opportunities and I just feel like
that's so inspiring like being yourself
like being your own person and people
who are not afraid to like be different
like that type of category I don't
really know how to put it into words but
that's probably what inspires me the
most because ever since I stopped caring
about when people think and started
doing what I loved and like doing my own
thing I feel like I've been so happy and
like when I do what I want and I do it
because I love it not because anybody
else loves it or wants me to do it it's
just like the best feeling in the world
so like makes me want to do it even more
and I don't know so yeah that's all I'm
gonna say for today because I've been
talking for so long and my leg is
starting to fall asleep but oh my god
Amy I also need a haircut my hair is
getting super long well that concludes
this little half of the Q&amp;amp;A sorry that I
look disgusting right now like this was
just really chill and I was gonna do it
get ready with me and like sit down and
put makeup on and then end up filming
but the Sun is kind of going down
outside and it's like getting darker so
I like Donna didn't have enough time to
film any videos which reminds me I also
need to buy a ring light so if you guys
are youtubers or like have any ring
lights for photography comment them down
below because I needed my ring light
because I need to film when there's no
natural light outside that's like a
problem that I have right now because I
really want to keep filming videos I
have so many hauls to do but I just
don't have enough natural light in the
day
so I'm gonna stop ranting I hope that
you guys enjoyed this video give it a
thumbs up if you like Q&amp;amp;A is and also if
you have any other questions send them
to me on Instagram and yeah I'll have
all of that stuff linked down below for
you guys thank you so so much for
watching this video and I will see you
guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
