today's video I have been waiting to do
for so long and I asked you guys on my
Instagram to ask me any questions that
you wanted and I am going to be doing a
Q&amp;amp;A today so I just wanted my Instagram
and I posted a photo and said ask me
anything and you guys responded there
are so many questions here so I'm going
to try to get through as many as I can
so if you're not following me on
Instagram you guys totally should I can
leave like a little screenshot of my
answer right here I love Instagram it's
my favorite platform to use obviously
other than YouTube but I feel like I
post a lot on my personal life on there
so if you guys want to follow along with
that make sure to follow me so without
further ado let's get started okay so
I'm gonna try to go through as many of
these as I can and if I have to put it
into two videos I will do that for you
guys because there are so many good
questions here so the first question I'm
gonna answer is do you have any tips so
first somebody who wants to start a
YouTube channel but is afraid of what
others will think of it honestly the
only tip that I have for you is to just
do it and honestly don't care about what
people think of you because believe it
or not I got made fun of by so many
people and now those people like don't
even say anything to me anymore just
because like I didn't care what they
thought I didn't let it get to me so my
the biggest tip that I have for you is
just to do it and if it makes you happy
who cares what other people think don't
care about what people think because
it's not their life it's yours so if
it's what makes you happy then you
should definitely do it
the next question is favorite restaurant
in my absolute favorite restaurant is
Benedetto's in the North End of Boston
if you guys are ever in Boston you need
to go there they have the best Italian
food ever advice for a junior in high
school this question is interesting just
because Emma's going through the same
exact thing as you are my sister's a
junior in high school and I feel like I
can give her a lot of advice and
something that I always tell her is just
did not care about what people think
because high school is so small and it's
such a short part of your life so like
if there are mean people in there a
drama just try to stay out of all of
that and like get away from it it's too
short and honestly like it's really not
worth it looking back for me I don't
even remember things that I used to
worry about in high school like what I
remember are the memories that I made
with my
and like just doing as much as you can
do in high school so just try to like
surround yourself with good people hang
out with your friends a lot and just
like do as much as you can just because
you don't want to look back and on in
high school and be like wow I regret
doing that or doing that and also big
tip for juniors out there don't stress
about college or where to apply to
college I had no idea where I was gonna
go to college I didn't know what I
wanted to do where I wanted to go where
I wanted to apply and I figured all that
out in my senior year I think it was in
the fall no idea where I wanted to go
and I just applied to schools and
honestly everybody ends up where you're
supposed to end up and there's a school
for everybody so the biggest piece of
advice that I would have for you is just
to not worry about all that and don't
stress it's really really really not
worth it what is the best advice you
could give somebody trying to be more
self-confident I love you so much
I love you too and the best advice that
I could give somebody for trying to be
more self-confident is to just be
yourself and not care about what others
think of you and I know it's like sounds
hard and it's easy easier said than done
but if you just live your life the way
that you want to live in it and you go
about it the way that you want to go
about it and you're just you and you
kind of just like vibe out then the
people who are meant to be in your life
will naturally gravitate towards you and
so for me at least like I feel like I am
just myself and the people who are meant
to be in my life stay in my life and the
people who are not don't and that's
totally fine so just be yourself and I
feel like you will be so much happier
and then everything in your life will
fall into place and yeah so that is my
advice for you ooh this question is good
I got this one a lot what do you do in
college I am a marketing major in
college and the college that I go to is
Bridgewater State University and it's a
really small state school in
Massachusetts and I chose to go here
just because it was a lot more
affordable than all of the other schools
that I had applied to and I didn't
really know what I wanted to do I didn't
really get into any of the schools that
I wanted to get into I really wanted to
get into this one school in particular
and I didn't so I was like why would I
go to another school and not be as happy
when I can just go somewhere that's
close to home it's close to Boston and
it's more affordable like I didn't want
to go somewhere and spend all this money
to go there if I didn't really love it
so I came here and honestly it's the
best decision of my life everyone
goes to the school that they're meant to
go to and everything happens for a
reason so I met Kaylee she's my absolute
best friend she's been my best friend
for three years I don't know what I
would do without her and if you guys
have any questions about my school if
you live in Massachusetts don't hesitate
to ask me I would love to answer them
and if you guys want to see a video
about like college or a college Q&amp;amp;A or
about where I go to college things like
that just leave your comments and stuff
and down below and let me know next
question how to get a guy to like you
this one's interesting honestly I feel
like there aren't things that you can do
to get a guy to like you and like you
shouldn't do anything to get a guy to
like you if the guy's gonna like you
he's gonna like you for who you are and
being like natural and just being
yourself you don't have to force a girl
to like you I promise and I feel like if
you do have to force I gotta like you
then he's definitely not the guy for you
next question how did your channel grow
so fast I get this question a lot like
how did my Instagram grow or how did my
YouTube grow and honestly like the one
main piece of advice that I can give you
guys is just to be yourself because
that's what I do I really don't like put
too much thought into all of these
things like my Instagram and my YouTube
I don't sit down and like put on a full
face of makeup and like try to a fix um
one I'm not I'm just real with you guys
and I feel like just being real with
yourself and being true to who you are
and just being natural is gonna get you
a lot farther than being fake on the
internet and like trying to get
followers and trying to get to grow and
all that stuff I feel like as viewers
you can see right through it for me at
least I've been watching YouTube videos
for so long and it's been something I've
wanted to do for such a long time that I
feel like I can see right through like
the youtubers who are authentic and
really want to be on YouTube and the
people who are just doing it like for
views for money and all of that stuff so
honestly just like be yourself and it's
something if it's something that you
really really love then it will
definitely work out for you next
question did you prefer high school or
do you think college is better and for
me I loved high school and I loved
college both of them I have two
completely different experiences with
but if I were to have to choose I
probably would choose college over high
school when and why did you start
YouTube PS love you love you too and I
started YouTube I posted my first video
in January 2017 and then I really
started posting videos in September 2017
so I basically started in September and
I started just because it's always been
something that I've been passionate
about and I used to go on tumblr shout
out to all my tumblr oh geez out there
and I would answer all of these
questions about like fashion Fitness
lifestyle you name it literally
everything I do on YouTube I would
answer on tumblr and I would write it
down and type it out in the computer to
answer my questions and it got to the
point where I was getting hundreds of
questions all the time and I was like
you know what it would be so much easier
if I just sat down in front of a camera
and just talked about this cuz I love
talking I cannot shut up I could talk
for hours so I was like you know what I
just need to do it one day I need to sit
down I need to start recording videos
and that's what we did so here I am this
question is really really good how do
you avoid your cravings sweets and junk
food and this is my number one tip for
how to avoid my cravings I don't I
literally don't avoid them I listen to
my cravings and I want ice cream
I will eat ice cream if I'm in the mood
for pizza
I'll eat pizza I just feel like life's
too short to restrict yourself and
everything is fine in moderation
obviously like eating about stuff
breakfast lunch and dinner all day every
day like isn't gonna be too good for
your body but if you're in the mood for
something once in a while have something
like if you want to go out with your
friends and go out to dinner and get
pizza you should do that or go out for
an ice-cream by all means you guys
should totally do that don't restrict
yourself I feel like that's just such an
unhealthy mindset to have and yeah so
that's what I do if I have a craving I
will listen to my craving next question
what is your dream vacation spot my
dream vacation spot I don't know why
I've really been wanting to go to Italy
lately
honestly just to eat the food like I
want to go there eat good food and like
see all the beautiful like things to see
there and take really cool pictures and
like wear really cute outfits like
Justin and stuff I don't know I just
feel like going to Italy would be like
such an interesting place to go to oh I
like this question what is your go-to
Mary Lou's drink and for all of my
people who live in Massachusetts I love
Mary Lou's coffee
if you have one near you you have to go
they're so good and also for all of you
that don't live in Massachusetts and you
love coffee
you can order their coffee online and
they have like flavored brewed coffee
because for me I drink my coffee black
and I don't like to put any sweeteners
in it or anything like that just plain
black coffee and I love from Mary Lou's
getting a toasted almond or a banana nut
black iced coffee
oh this was interesting I feel like I've
never talked about this on my channel
this one says what is your ethnicity and
I am Portuguese and Irish and my dad is
Irish and my mom is well my dad's Irish
and Scottish and my mom is Portuguese in
French so that's what I am this is funny
do you have a Boston accent also I love
you and you're amazing I love you too
and I don't think I have a Boston accent
let me know in the comments down below
if you think that I have an accent
because I feel like that would be kind
of interesting to see like how you guys
hear my voice and stuff like that so let
me know what is your favorite healthy
snacks hmm my favorite healthy snack
would probably be I've really been
liking like baby carrots lately with
nothing on them just eating them plain
and I love green grapes and green apples
cut up those are my favorites right now
how do you manage YouTube working out
having a social life and school well
that's a question that I honestly ask
myself every day um I don't know I kind
of just do it I don't really think that
much into it I just kind of like go with
the flow get things done as they come
and then deal with it as it goes I don't
really think that much into it really
because I feel like if you do that you
start overthinking and then you get
stressed out and it's like crazy so I
just go with the flow and I live my life
HL I get things done and it all just
works out for me where do you attend
college what is your class schedule
slash classes you are taking this
semester and I feel like this one's
really interesting and I really want to
do like a college related Q&amp;amp;A just
because I've gotten so many college
questions on here and I just wanted to
say like I said before earlier in the
video I go to Bridgewater State
University and I am taking five classes
I'm taking a dance class a social
problems class
statistics management and one more what
else is the other one that I take oh I
take a computer class too so those are
the classes that I'm taking I'm almost
done with my major and then I have a few
like extra requirements to do so I'm
just gonna be doing that but I am a
full-time student and I live off campus
at my school in an apartment would you
do a meet-up in Massachusetts yes
definitely I really want to do Meetup
and I really want to plan one really
soon like when it gets warmer out I'll
probably end up doing one in Boston
because I feel like I love Boston during
the spring like on a cool spring day how
do you meet up I don't know I just like
that'd be super fun
so definitely like keep an eye out on my
Instagram for that what app do you use
to edit your insta photos I use
afterlight in Disco okay so these are
gonna be my last few questions and one
of them is do you dye your hair and what
I ever dye my hair and this is my
natural hair right now it's just this
dark brown color that it always is it's
just straight I've never straightened it
I don't blow-dry it
I've never dyed it so this is just my
natural hair it's just brown straight
long and yeah I don't think I would ever
die and I really like my color and I
feel like it would damage my hair if I
did that and make it like not as soft as
in it as it is so no I don't think I
would ever dye my hair oh this one's sad
do you like your charger case I love my
charging case and I just recently got a
new phone I have the iPhone 8 plus and I
have to get rid of my charging case
because they don't make them for this
phone and I'm so sad I really do miss it
I feel like my phone's always dying now
so annoying I kind of took that case for
granted when I had it okay last question
how did you and arlynn meet and what was
your first impression of arlen I think
that this one's so funny because as you
guys didn't know Arlen and I went to
high school together and I met him when
I was in like seventh grade and my first
impression of him I don't know he's
always just been like one of my really
good friends he's really funny we played
hockey together growing up and I love
him and know I've been reading through
these questions and I've been seeing
this a ton we're not dating
we will never date we're just friends
and all this stuff that you guys see
like on the internet about like Marlin
and all that stuff it's just a stroking
around
but I love Arlen and I don't really know
that my first impression of him was but
actually I don't want to end with this
question oh okay this is a good question
to end with so last question lol is
there someone new in your life
and if yes are you genuinely happy with
them let me think about how to answer
this question okay
is there someone new in my life the
person not new to my life but yes new to
like right now and yes I am genuinely
happy with them I'm really happy right
now there is somebody in my life so yeah
that's what I'm gonna leave it off with
and end this video I have so many more
questions so I'll probably do like a
second half of this Q&amp;amp;A but I just want
to end this one off here I hope that you
guys enjoyed it if you want me to do a
college Q&amp;amp;A just leave your comments
down below because I feel like I got so
many college related questions and I
would like to split it up and do a video
like related to just college and I kind
of split it up from like real life and
all of the like that academic stuff so
if you guys like this video just give it
a thumbs up leave all of your comments
down below thank you so so much for
watching I love you guys so much and I
will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
