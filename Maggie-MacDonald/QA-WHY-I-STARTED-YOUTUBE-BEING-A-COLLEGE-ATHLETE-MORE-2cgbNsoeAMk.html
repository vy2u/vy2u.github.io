today's video I am going to do a part
two of the Q&amp;amp;A that I did a few weeks
ago you guys seem to really like my Q&amp;amp;A
videos and in case you're new to my
channel I just feel like that's a good
way for you to get to know me a little
bit better and I also love answering all
of your questions so again I went on my
Instagram I posted a photo I told you
guys to ask me whatever you want so I'm
just gonna go through and answer some of
the questions that I didn't answer
before and I'm super excited you guys
are asking the best things and if you
are not following me on Instagram you
guys totally shuttle have all of my
social medias linked down below just
because if I do do a Q&amp;amp;A I will post one
of my photos there and then it just say
like in the caption comment all your
questions here so you guys don't want to
miss it in case you do another one and
yet without further ado let's get
started first question why did you
decide to become a youtuber and I feel
like my first instinct when not instinct
I think that's not the right word but
the reason why I became a youtuber was
because I had always been on tumblr and
I was really active on there like a
really long time ago when I was younger
but now I get so many questions on
tumblr about like what to wear and like
different things about like fashion
lifestyle fitness everything I talk
about on YouTube and it came to a point
where I was getting so many questions
and I loved answering them like I would
answer them all the time I would spend
hours doing it but I was like wait I'm
literally sitting behind a computer
typing out all these answers and started
to get so tedious I was like I need to
make a youtube channel I need to sit
down I need to talk about this cuz I
talk so much I feel like I could talk
for hours and hours so that's basically
why I started my youtube channel just
because I want to help you guys I want
to like share my love for fashion
fitness lifestyle beauty everything that
is out there so I came on YouTube and I
just started next question do you play
any sports
I feel like this question
I've never really talked about on my
channel and the answer to that is I
don't play sports right now but I did in
the past I literally grew up playing ice
hockey I played ever since I was in
kindergarten all throughout high school
to my senior year and I just came to the
point where I was like I don't want to
play sports anymore like I love it and
it's something that's been a huge part
of my life but I felt like feel like I
did so much growing up that like by the
time I graduated from high school I was
just so done with it I didn't want to
continue to play in college so freshman
year of college I didn't play any sports
and then my sophomore year I walked on
the field hockey team at the school that
I go to right now I didn't go anywhere
else for college so like basically my
college I played on the field hockey
team for one year and I needed it I was
like this is not for me I need to do
something better with my time I'm not
into sports anymore I'd rather go to the
gym work out on my own so I ended up
finishing up the season and then just
not returning back the next year which
would have been this year my the
beginning of my junior year but instead
the beginning of my junior year I spend
my time making my youtube channel oh
this is a really good question how do
you manage your money and honestly
that's something that I need to work on
and I've like started to work on right
now I feel like I just like need to
realize and put in perspective like what
I actually want in what I need or what I
wanted what I actually need so that's
helped me a lot I feel like I don't go
shopping as much as I used to anymore
just because I realized that like I
literally only wear sweatshirts and
joggers and the weather here in
Massachusetts is so gross that like I
don't have anything that I really want
to buy cuz I'm not gonna use it right
now I feel like I just saved my money
and like realize like what's necessary I
guess and yeah so I guess just like sit
down and think about your life and like
what are the necessary things in your
life and just kind of prioritize like
what you want to spend money on like
what you should be spending money on
it'll kind of help you get like a better
sense of direction and like help you
save more I don't really know if that
made sense or that helped but yeah okay
next question how do you make money in
college
and right now obviously I am making
money through YouTube but before I
started YouTube because I know not
everybody is gonna be able to do that I
used to sell clothes on Poshmark
and that's one of the ways that I make
money and I also have another cool way
to make money and that is through the
website called swag bucks and I've
actually used this website before like
before I ever started YouTube and
basically what you do is you go online
and you take surveys you answer
questions you can go look at online
stores you can watch videos and you can
make money and earn rewards and like get
give gift cards through that and I also
have a $5 signup bonus for you guys
which i think is totally awesome you
guys can click the link down below in
the description box and start earning
money and cash rewards and also gift
cards next question what is your
favorite place that you have travel to
honestly my favorite place that I've
traveled to so far has been Miami and
I've never been before and I just
recently went twice you guys know that
if you saw like all my vlogs and stuff
and all my Instagram posts but I am
obsessed with Miami I feel like I was
meant to go there and I don't know
there's just something about it that I
love like I love the beach I love like
how there's so many different things to
do like you can go shopping you can go
to cool restaurants you can like just go
and chill by the beach you can what else
can you do Miami you can go out if you
want like there's so much to do there
and it's not a far plane ride from where
I live in Massachusetts which I also
liked it's only like two and a half
three hours and you literally can do
anything there so Miami has definitely
been one of my favorite places so far
but I still feel like I have places that
I'm gonna go to and love eventually but
as of right now that's probably my
favorite next question do you want kids
if so how many and you have any names in
mind okay so yes I do want kids
eventually like not right now but
obviously I'm only 21 I do want kids and
I used to want four kids I just want
three boys and one girl
obviously you can't choose but I think
right now I want to I think two is a
good number and I don't have any names
for my kids but I know that I want my
first kid to be a boy
next question where will you travel next
PS I love you I love you too and I'm
traveling wait that's so weird I'm
actually going to Coachella in two weeks
so that's the next place I'm going to
and then after that I'm going to Aruba
for 11 days with my dad and my sister oh
my god this question is really cute what
did you want to be when you were younger
honestly when I was younger I wanted to
be a famous singer that's like what I
wanted to be and I used to tell my mom
all the time I'd be like I want to be a
famous singer I used to love Miley Cyrus
and Hilary Duff and I would literally
like invite my whole family over when
they would come over like family parties
and I would do like shows I would put on
a show for my family and I would sing in
front of them because I like wanted to
be a famous singer when I was younger
oh this question is really cute what is
your favorite thing about YouTube and
making videos I think one of my favorite
things about YouTube and making videos
which I realize kind of today because I
hit seventy thousand subscribers on
YouTube which I'm so thankful for but I
don't know I just feel like my favorite
thing about making YouTube videos is
being able to inspire you guys and help
all of you because I get so many cute
DMS that honestly like more my heart you
guys tell me that like I helped you out
in so many situations and I inspire you
to be the best version of yourself and
that's like what I want to do like I
don't come on YouTube to sit down and
like put on a bunch of makeup and like
make myself look cute all the time and
like be fake and like just make videos
that aren't gonna help you I feel like I
just want to be like one of your best
friends and like be real with you guys
and try to like give you advice with
whatever it may be like fashion anything
in your life beauty whatever so I think
that would probably be my favorite part
about YouTube just being able to inspire
I keep getting this question a lot and I
have answered it in all of my other my
other Q&amp;amp;A that I just did but I felt
like I should just answer it again in
case you didn't see that one and it is
what university do you go to and what is
your major and I go to Bridgewater State
University in Bridgewater Massachusetts
and my major is marketing favorite
places to shop my favorite store right
now is princess Polly my absolute
favorite I love everything from there
and that is definitely my obsession
right now who is your favorite singer
slash rapper
I feel like I go through phases where I
like different people at different times
but right now I really like post Malone
and Drake I don't know I just feel like
I like them because it's like a chill
vibe and that's like my vibe right now
like I go through different phases in
different seasons of what music I like
so that's definitely what I like right
now and if you guys want to follow me on
Spotify I'll have my Spotify link down
below okay next question how do you stay
so confident in your body I feel like I
eat well and work out a ton and I'm
still not that confident I feel like
this question like a lot of people feel
this way and you shouldn't feel bad
about yourself for feeling that way
about yourself like I don't know if I
just worded that right but I feel like
there are so many girls out there that
are like I workout so much I eat so
healthy but like I'm still not that
confident just because of what they see
on social media and how they see all of
these girls on Instagram like looking so
good
but you just have to realize that nobody
is gonna post a bad photo of themself on
social media like everybody posts their
best angles their best pictures them
like flexing no one's gonna post them in
their natural state when they're just
like hanging out chilling and relaxing
so I just feel like you have to realize
that everybody's human and that's your
body the one that you were given and
born with and so just learn to accept
yourself the way that you are and know
that may sound hard and it's easier said
than done but for me at least I just
realized that like this is the way that
I was born and it's just the way that I
am and it's cool that you're different
from someone else because if everybody
looks like each other like there would I
don't know how to word it but like the
way that you are and like appreciate all
of the like ways that your body work was
creative I don't know I can't get my
thoughts into words
I can't get it out oh that's cute okay
these make you different and make you
you and that makes you special which
makes you more beautiful yeah okay that
was good
so maybe just keep that part in it this
one's kind of funny you would have a
look nothing alike sisters yeah I don't
know we really don't look that much
alike but we are sisters oh this one's
kind of cute that somebody like thought
about writing this on my picture what is
your biggest accomplishment in your own
opinion that you have made in your life
so far that's really cute like to think
about but my biggest accomplishment in
my life I don't know if I can narrow it
down to just one I guess like some of my
biggest accomplishments that I've had is
that my junior year of high school my
hockey team won the national
championship and then also my senior
year we won the state championship in
Massachusetts and so I feel like that
was a big accomplishment for that moment
in my life but probably this moment in
the present right now is just everything
that I've done on YouTube and just
following my dreams and pursuing my
career and everything and just not
caring about what people think and just
doing what I love and what makes me
happy so that's definitely one of my
biggest accomplishments right now next
question what coffee do you get from
that Mary Lou's place you go to and
Starbucks
from Mary Lou's I get a toasted almond
or I get banana nut or blueberry
cinnamon crumble whatever I'm really
feeling in the moment I don't really
have a specific order
I just got whatever I'm feeling and then
from Starbucks I get a venti iced coffee
with a little bit of almond milk oh this
one's kind of interesting favorite meal
and I feel like my favorite meal is
definitely breakfast I'm a breakfast
person I love all breakfast foods and I
feel like it's just so much fun to go
out to breakfast and then order like
french toast or get like bacon or
pancakes
I don't know breakfast is definitely my
favorite okay so my last question since
this video is already so so so long and
I don't want to make it too long and for
you
but the last question is what makes you
happy and I think that this one is so
cute and like a good note to end off
with so what makes me happy there are a
lot of things that make me happy but
probably just being around my friends
and my family and just people who are
gonna make me a better person and at the
end of the day people who I enjoy being
with like Kaylee Emma
Gretchen arlynn Tyler there are so many
people that like make me happy but I
think just being around people who are
gonna make me the best version of myself
that I can be so that concludes this Q&amp;amp;A
video I hope that you guys enjoyed it
and give this video a thumbs up if you
would like to see another one I know you
guys have been dying to see a college
Q&amp;amp;A which that will be coming I'm gonna
post a picture on my Instagram soon and
have you guys comment all of your
college questions below but in the
meantime thank you so much for watching
