today's video I just thought that I
would show you guys like a vlog style of
a pamper night routine just because I
have been traveling so much lately and I
just got back from a trip over the
weekend and my flight didn't get in
until like 5 o'clock this morning and
then I have to I'll be back to my
apartment
and I've just had like the longest day
and the longest night and I just thought
like there was no better way to like
de-stress and like get back into routine
other than to do a little paper night
and of course like a bunch of youtubers
do these and they do like voiceovers and
like make it all cool and stuff like
that but I don't know I just liked up
sewed up my vibe like I want my channel
to be like me talking to you guys as a
virtual best friend like I don't want I
don't know I'm just like not crazy with
like my edits and stuff so I just
thought that I would do it a little bit
more vlog style and I feel like that's a
lot more personal too because like I
will just be talking to you guys and
it'll be chill relaxing so without
further ado let's get started with my
pamper night routine so I just put self
tanner all over my body and then put
this big baggy few people's sweat shirt
on and now I'm just gonna lay in my bed
and chill and I want to talk to you guys
about an app that I've recently been
loving and it is called color Phi and
also the color by number app and thank
you so much - color Phi and color by
number for sponsoring this video of
course all of these opinions are my own
I just wanted to show you guys a little
bit of what the apps are like because
I've been traveling so much lately and
sometimes I don't like being on planes
like it stresses me out if I don't have
anything to do and I recently flew Delta
and Delta didn't have Wi-Fi on it so I
had nothing to do luckily I used this
app and I was playing around with it and
it kind of just like helped relieve all
of the stress that I've had and it's
nice to just like lay in bed and use the
apps I'll show you guys what they do
they really help me de-stress because I
have been traveling so much lately that
I don't know I just feel like they are
such a nice way to just like
relax and calm down and like chill so
this is the color fire and I have a
profile right here and I just created
this you guys know if you watch my live
streams I love a popcorn what you
basically do is you pick a template and
then you can pick all of the different
colors you want to use and then just
like click the areas that are white and
then they color in your whole entire
photo so I thought that this one was so
cute look at a little pup corner house
like little rosy cheeks and I made it
baby blue and then added like a little
bit of red and I made the popcorn yellow
and then I added like a nice coral
background to that and the other app is
color bright number and oh my god this
literally is a trend because this is my
other favorite snack and I did a little
ice cream cone and as you can see it's
kind of like a tannish color right here
and then there's like brown and then the
cone is all different colors and so
basically what you do is you just take
the color of like the number that it
says so it'll be like one and then one
will be brown and then you just go
around to all the places that have a
number one and color it Brown and then
you do it for all the other colors and
then this is what it turned out like and
look how cute it is so I just want to
tell you guys quickly about those apps
I've been using lately and I'll have the
links down below in the description for
you to download them so in order to have
sorry I'm like lighting this thing away
in order to have the best like Cho
pamper night you need to light some
candles so the ones I'm going to be
lighting are from Anthropologie they're
my absolute very candles ever and my
best friend Lily actually got this one
for me for my birthday
let me just light it oh my god hold on
and my best friend Lily got this for me
for my birthday and it's vanilla and fig
from anthro and it smells so so so good
and then I'm also gonna light this other
one that I got from Anthropologie a
really long time ago it's just their
signature like one that comes in this
white little metallicky jar thingy and
so I have my candles lit now this one
smells amazing oh my god it's like
running out I don't know if it's gonna
I'm so sad so now I'm going into my face
mask drawer and I have all these ones
that you guys would have seen like in
one of my most recent blogs and I got
them from Whole Foods they're my
favorite I have a braiding one a
luminous one and this one is also
brightening but I don't know if I'm
going to use one of these or if I'm
going to use my origins clear
improvement active charcoal mask I also
really like this one too and then I have
this origins retexturizing clay Rose
mask which I haven't used in so long I'm
smells so good I don't know which one to
use
I don't know what to do when I also have
a bunch of them from lush so oh my god I
didn't think this would be this hard
Marcus got me this one for my birthday
it's called bunny moon and it's one of
their jelly face masks this one smells
so good too okay oh my god and then I
also have these collagen essence facial
tissue masks I think these are sheet
masks I've never used a sheet mask
before okay I'm gonna do something
completely different than I've ever done
in my whole entire life and I'm gonna
use this cucumber hydrating soothing and
toning collagen essence tissue facial
mask normal I'm scared I'm really scared
I don't know what one to use okay guys I
figured out which one I'm going to use
I'm just gonna use my origins charcoal
mask because I can't go wrong I already
know that I really really like it so I'm
just gonna apply it with this makeup our
site I have from Target it's just one of
their like up and up brand brushes and I
use it for exactly what I'm doing
just to apply face masks because I feel
like it just like spread so much more
evenly when you use a brush and I don't
like getting my hands Oh like yucky and
dirty okay so I'm officially done with
applying of my little face mask and now
I'm gonna go wash off my brush and make
some tea because I wanna have like a
real chill night and I just feel like
making tea is just gonna help like relax
me and I don't know like I feel I just
want to like lay in bed and like drink
tea and go on my computer and listen to
music and this lighting is awful and I'm
really sorry so I have my little mug
right here and I'm gonna have some
chamomile tea and this is just the
Bigelow cozy chamomile herbal tea and
it's caffeine free which is good because
it's almost nine o'clock so I'm just
kind of like chill have a good night get
ready for bed and relax and I don't want
to be like up all night or anything like
that so this is just gonna like calm me
down and make it so I can just like
chill and relax and enjoy my night and
this is my little kiri that I have I
love it so much so I'm just gonna press
this button and get it
okay so I just wanted to talk to you
guys about my self tanner that I use
because a lot of you guys like asked me
which self tanner I using give this
video a thumbs up if you want me to do
like a self tanning routine and like
show you guys step-by-step what I do how
I get my fake tan in the winter the most
natural-looking way but I have my self
tanner right here that I use and I just
used the Lovington deluxe running
bronzing mousse in the shade dark and I
apply it just with my little mint but
that's what I did I put self tanner on
today just because I feel like it makes
the me feel like a lot better about
myself when I have a nice tan and stuff
like that need to go take off my mask
now it's completely like dry and
hardened and I can already feel that my
face feels so good so I'm gonna go do
that and then I'm gonna put you guys
through like a little skincare routine
thing and show you guys exactly what I
do for my skin like what I do for my
skin and how I get it ready like for the
night because I know a lot of you guys
have been like asking me about that
lately so I will go into detail and show
it to you but I'm gonna take this off
really really quick so one second I've
been with my face mask now and I just
wanted to show you guys like a little
skin care what I do at night when I'm
getting ready for bed so right now I'm
just putting on this strawberry Burt's
Bees chapstick it's really really good
and hydrating and I really like it a lot
it's one of my favorites right now
but my hair's a mess so I'm actually
gonna put um self tanner on my face so I
just wanted to a little bit before so
I'm gonna be taking the fresh rose
floral toner and then spraying that on a
little cotton pad and just wiping that
all over my face just in case any of the
access um mask is on there and just to
get like all of the other crap let's all
my face off if it didn't come off like
when I took a shower earlier so I'm just
gonna rub that all over and see is there
anything on there and see that guys that
is literally why you need to use a toner
and
if you don't have a good toner you don't
know what toner is you definitely should
get this fresh one you can get it at
Sephora it's so so so good
it's like forty dollars for this bottle
I literally have half of this bottle
left and I got it in November like the
middle of November so it's so so so good
I recommend it to everybody you guys can
use it as a setting spray for your
makeup as well so it's really helpful
and it works so good I feel like that's
one of the reasons why I like my skin is
so clear because this product is so
amazing
alright now I'm gonna go in with my
serum which I should probably order a
new one because I don't have any left
but I use it the Kensington apothecary
skin serum number one ageless beauty if
you guys want to check it out I will
leave their website link down below for
you but it's really really good
toner I just like braves your face and
like gets rid of all of the
imperfections and i feel like it just
evens out my skin tone so I just apply
that all over after I can tone my face
and then I'm gonna go in with
moisturizer and for moisturizer I just
use the Cetaphil regular moisturizing
lotion you can get it at any drugstore I
really like this one it's one of my
favorites I've been using it for years
and years so I'm just gonna apply that
all over any dry spots on my face
because I am going to be putting
self-tanner on my face and I didn't want
like it to stick to any dry spots and I
just feel like when I moisturize my face
and it just is so much more like even
when I apply these self-tanner and
usually I don't recommend self-tanning
your face because sometimes it makes me
break out but I'm in like the point of
my life where I'm so pale and I like
need my face to be tan and I love like
having eyelash extensions with a tan
face because it just like makes me feel
so much more put together and I don't
have to remake up so I'm gonna take this
Real Techniques Beauty Blender and just
pump a little bit of the self-tanner on
it and then I'm literally just gonna
wipe it on my face and I don't wet the
sponge or anything like before I apply
it I mean I guess you could you don't
really have to but I didn't so I just
feel like when the sponge is
wet like it makes this off Tanner come
out weird so I'm just gonna make sure
that it's all even on my face like I can
already see that like I have some color
and it's making me feel so much better
so now I'm done as you guys can see I
already have some color on it which is
so amazing I'm so excited to look up in
the morning and being really really tan
so now I'm just going to get in bed and
watch some YouTube videos and just like
be really really chill and relaxed like
I was saying I've had such a busy week
and I've just had so much going on I
haven't really had time like for me and
just to take time for myself so I just
wanted to kind of like bring you guys
along my night I know this was really
chill and I didn't really do much but
this is like what I do if I just want to
have like a relaxing night I will put on
some self-tanner get comfy clothes on
and then I will like do a face mask and
sit in my bed listening music drink tea
that's literally what I do like I don't
do anything I try not to go on my phone
a lot I'll watch some YouTube videos
catch up like see what my friends are
doing watch Arlen's videos cartoon
videos EMAS videos and now I'm going to
get ready for bed now that I have all my
self-tanner on and they need to go brush
my teeth but I just wanted to end off
the vlog here and again give this video
a thumbs up if you guys want to see a
full self-tanning routine I will show
you guys how I get the most natural
looking tan in the winter and I hope you
guys have an amazing day or night
