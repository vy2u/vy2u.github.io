so we are packing up in Florence I look
at where we are sometimes I'm like we've
been to so many places but today should
be a fun day we're like transferring
from Florence to Rome and you guys would
have seen in my last vlog when we were
transferring from Venice to Florence
like we made a stop on the way and we
get to go to an extra city for lunch and
we get to walk around and see it which
is really awesome and so Gretchen and I
just ate breakfast which is so funny
here because the breakfast is so
different then it is at home I'm like
trying to find my face wash because we
are about to leave I need wash my face
but the breakfast is so different we had
like granola and fruit and then we had
like a bread roll like I don't know why
they have stuff like that at breakfast I
just think it's so funny it's like one
of those rolls that you would get if you
go out to dinner which I don't know
that's just so different
but anyway I'm like getting ready to
start the day so I'm just gonna go ahead
and wash my face right now you guys
would see that like I just got onto the
shower and I don't like washing my face
in the shower in Italy because like the
pressures so high that I feel like all
of my eyelash extensions have like
fallen out so yeah that's just like a
different story that's why they
literally look naked so I'm just gonna
go ahead and wash my face in the sink
and I've been using this little mini
seat of all gentle skin cleanser just
because it it's like a little
travel-size one you guys know that I use
this when I'm at home my drummer table
just actually recommended it to me and
I'm just gonna put a little dabble of it
on to my brush and the brush that I'm
using is just the ultimate skin spa
brush by vanity planet I talked to it
I'm one of their brushes in my videos
like a while ago if you guys remember
and I just take the brush and I kind of
just drag it along my face like this and
I feel like when I travel my skin gets
really really like gross I don't know if
you guys feel that same way when you
travel but I just feel like I need like
an extra exfoliant and I usually love
like skincare and face
and stuff when I'm at home and I feel
like when you're traveling like it's so
hard to use a face mask and like sit
down and have enough time to like
actually take care of your skin so I
love this because it's super easy and on
the go and I'm literally gonna wash my
face an exfoliate and then put
moisturizer on and go so it's the
easiest thing in the world and I will
have a link down below if you guys if
you want to get this brush as well and
you also get something for self which is
such a good deal because usually these
brushes are super expensive but yeah so
I'm just gonna go ahead wash my face and
then get ready for the rest of the day
we just got a text from our tour guide
Jason that we actually don't have to be
through the bus until a half-hour from
now because they're still waiting on
someone's logic luggage so Gretchen
there were like oh my god like we have
extra time to do stuff and like you get
ready but I just want to show you guys
my all but because I really like it
today well I mean it's kind of just
simple you can like see me in the mirror
right there um it's kind of simple
because it's just like a travel day
we're going to and from like a different
city but I'm just wearing this white
bodysuit from forever 21
with my new black Gucci belt and then
these shorts said I got from Zara which
I really like because they're not like
really short because some of my shorts
are super short because like my legs and
butter look bigger than my waist area so
then I have to like end up ordering like
shorts that are fit my waist but like
are small on the bottom like I don't
know anyway I just feel like if they
always are so short of me and they
always like don't fit me right but I
found these ones and I actually like
appropriate looking and they're kind of
long and then I also got these really
sick shoes it was sick but um look at
that hold on I'm trying to find like the
best light there are these sneakers and
they have these big platforms and
they're from Zara also a nice feel like
they make your legs look super long and
lean and I'll have like these items that
I'm wearing link to down below um like
always sorry I'm literally so tired I
got like no sleep ah say I'm so
jet-lagged but this is just what my hope
it looks like and these are my shoes so
if you want
have this outfit I'll have a link down
below so we finally just made it to
Orvieto
and this is like a little town that we
just stopped in or yet no it's not a
city it's definitely a town right so
we're in Orvieto and we just got here
and it's really beautiful we have to
like take a bunch of buses to get like
on top of where we are because I think
it's like higher elevated than where
everything else is like it's on like a
big hill or mountain or something I
don't really know so like don't quote me
on that but look at this church in the
middle I feel like one of the most
beautiful parts about Italy is that
there's like big churches and they have
so much detail and artwork I just think
they're really cool this looks so good I
got a spicy tomato sauce with and that's
a cool type of pasta then Gretchen got
what I got last night we got a caprese
little so now we're leaving bad guys
better than you think Sheila did tell us
it's called Orvieto yeah I don't really
know but anyway so we just had a really
yummy lunch you guys would have seen
where we were having lunch with on one
of our like tour guides one of the girls
that works for the company that were
with EF ultimate and you guys you have
ultimate break magnet if you're having
lunch with her so I didn't want to like
vlog and like talk too much he reassured
you guys like what we got but it was
super yummy and I got like a spicy like
tomato sauce cause I think the pass was
really good it was like a different type
of pasta yeah but now we're gonna head
out
and then go to Rome in we're stopping
right now for a little meeting so once
again so what I was saying was the
bathroom like right we got here the fun
easily happen that Gretchen was like
ranting about like we were just talking
and we were like walking walking walking
and then all of a sudden like I just
kept like walking straight like after I
paid to go in the bathroom switch is
really funny you have to pay to use
bathroom here if it's a public restroom
anyway um so I kept walking and I just
watched straight lady like straight into
the boys bathroom and I was like I
caught it like I'm peeing and I
literally knew that I was I was like oh
my god like I loo I can't leave I can't
leave this office there's gonna be like
voice we're like what are you in the
bathroom right now like is this super
weird and awkward and I would have been
like so yeah Beasley I went in the boys
locker in Jinju to Hydra just all to all
the voids left so she give you so yeah
make sure you're always looking at the
signs the doors open
so we're in Berlin and this is a
pantheon
behind me and we are walking around and
we're on a little tour right now I
actually just had the head run in from
the tour and I feel like it was like
distract you from talking but we arrived
at the Pantheon it's very busy here we
heard that Rome is going to be the
busiest city so far so it definitely is
I can already like tell that there's
just so many more people here than
diversity that we've been to but this is
the Pantheon right here look at all of
the columns I think this is so cool
we're going inside
well this is
so something that Gretchen Justin told
to me is that you see that the Pantheon
I guess when it rains like they don't
cover it or anything like it's never
covered it's just a wide open hole and
see that area over there in the middle
it's all like blocked off and stuff and
the rain literally falls down through
that and it's just raining on the inside
of the building they don't like do it
they just like let it go and our I said
that if it's ever raining like in any of
the days over here we all live here to
like run down and see it just because
it's so amazing and to see that that's
so cool my question just will be about
that
right now we're walking down the road
and there's literally so many like chill
out places on the street
go back because I'm so hungry I really
want to try he's a lot like a different
ones kiss yours it was really good I've
got you better guess you go to use a lot
wanna and I'm in the mood for some right
now I'm like walking by all these places
like just one that's actually right in
front of me right here there's all these
signs hanging that says they all say 115
that means that they have a hundred and
fifty flavors going so bad I love this
little area I feel like this is the
cutest like there was little restaurants
over there you need to do some shopping
and I love the coloring of this street
just loving the buildings are like that
peachy orange color it's my favorite
these are the Spanish Steps it looks so
beautiful I want to go up there they try
to take a picture actually maybe we'll
come back tomorrow because I'm really
you're talking about dog
this is so cool wait what are those over
there looks like a little child
I've no idea whether it is
Wow that areas those are little balls I
was talking about but I think it's a nut
I think it's a roasted nut oh my gosh
guys each heavy fountain this is insane
this is unreal around there well I did
toss a coin in there forgot this is so
cool so this is it up close I think that
the detailing on the building and like
all the couch and stuff is so beautiful
look at the water it's so clear and blue
I'm gonna go down and try to get really
close and
in there in our tour guy told us that if
you throw the coin with your was Iranian
you've been bringing it over your left
shoulder look one point you are going to
come back to Rome and then if you do 214
that you are going to come back to Rome
and get far and fall in love and then
you can do three it means that you're
gonna come back to Rome bomb love make
it very
I just left and now we're going to go
