and like walking don't these marble
stairs right now and we are about to get
breakfast and we're at a different hotel
as I was saying yesterday and I guess
Gretchen said breakfast is really great
because it hasn't really been that good
for the past couple of days well show
you there's so much more stuff than what
they have had in the past like this
looks a little bit I just really want
coffee there's so much
I'm so sad because I left my sunglasses
in the room I like had them attached to
this like thing right there I mean and
put them somewhere because I'm using
this mini bag today finally didn't have
that much room in it
Larry do with my nervy bags and I don't
have my keys or anything so I just like
tried to put them on me and then I end
up forgetting them which I'm really sad
about because it's super sunny here and
I also feel like I have no I - is so I
like wearing them in photos just because
like I just like like the way that they
look I messed up my sake they're very
chic and they have a really nice touch
and I've dug it definitely brought out
back - oh my god oh my gosh like that
you know like in case we're late cause
we literally
or whatever
we just got to the Colosseum you guys
let's see it right there next to me
we're going inside right now to do a
little tour on the inside but it's so
cool I guess there's like Roman numerals
yeah I can see them they're like carved
into the side of it like right up here
you can't really see in the camera but
it's like all the entrances are numbered
and I think Gretchen how many entrances
were there how many entrances were there
anything 76 entrances so these arches
great or arcs I think all right arch
like the places where you enter and
there's like three rows of arches that
go all the way up which is really cool
the thing is enormous it's Chuck eight
years to build Wow lady Gretchen calls
our tour guide okay his name's Tyson you
guys all know his name's Tyson and like
she's huger's anyway she keeps calling
him kygo and tiger oh my god like
Beauvoir chasin she's literally like oh
what's name again I go no I know we've
known improving again oh who is
completely but we're inside and only
8:30 so I'm hilarious oh my god it's so
early and we're like
there's no jacket but Gretchen and I
like wanted to take a nap someplace
aches we have a bunch of like three
times but I feel like the people they
can't and that's it's quite like we're
not gonna taking out for realistically
just one sample they may be tired like
we were yesterday and then
mmm-hmm guys these are the original like
rocks and stuff up the Romanus you still
walk on and they like put these in here
a long long time ago and these were
actually put in in the year 80 so really
long time ago
they're real marble steps in this area
that we're in now is like where the
temple would be that's what Tyson just
told us but a lot of it does obviously
like falling apart and stuff just
because it was built so long ago but
it's kind of cool to see like where
everything used to be and stuff and like
there's so many cool different places
and again like what I'm saying before is
that these stones are the original ones
that they had in the ground when they
made everything around here in the year
80 and I think these right here are
actually real drinking water I think
that's what they tell us there's the
freshest water in Italy like ever and
people are actually allowed to drink em
it's so cool to be able to see
everything like where we aren't today
just because I feel like I've learned
about this stuff in school for so long
and like this was one of the most
interesting things I learned about when
I was in I think I was in seventh or
eighth grade and I used to learn about
like Rome and everything and I know that
I'm a loves are interactive stuff so I'm
just really gonna like but I don't know
it's a really cool year I really want to
come back here someday with Tyler I know
he's like super into history and stuff
never I always talk about it
Wow
that's cool this is a before and then
this is after what it looks like now
so we have like a half an hour until our
pasta we can cross when we're all
meeting up and stuff so
Tyson recommended this piece called in
Florida and Gretchen and I are gonna go
in against it because he said that we
are gonna be so busy like making pasta
and like in the actually good so or the
burrata and pesto which i think is that
one right there there's so many guys I
don't know which I was so bad in those
little mini peppers so Gretchen and I
got the pizza now and this is when I got
I got the tomato mozzarella basil one
and then she got the burrata pasta one
and we're gonna do like one of each of
them is yours good cuz she already
started eating hers and I haven't eaten
yet so I'm gonna try it and show you
guys but it had like a ton of olive oil
on it
so I need to like be careful when I bite
it but this is ooh
taste test to see if Tyson's pizza place
is as good as he said
oh my god struggling here in the dime
it's so good
Wow the brothers just so different here
then back at home like it is unreal and
the cheese doesn't make my stomach hurt
now I'm eating the burrata and pesto one
look at that Gretchen just had and it's
so good the groceries just saying we're
really gonna miss having you guys Tyler
and I are obsessed with margarita pizza
and just like nothing compares to this
like I love my pizza but I think and
like around I don't know where we're
gonna get did you like that one better
this one better I can do five different
like yeah that one there's not much
tomato but it's really yummy but this
one's like big get me Tomatoes mm-hmm
the tomatoes on the one that cartoons
eating are so big and fresh and this
one's good because I like the cheese
I'm here for my groceries everything's
so fresh
so many of them think we can get
whatever our starting off smoking pot
and so this little girl in the front
there is who's going to be like teaching
the class and right now we're gonna pick
a bunch of fresh fruits and veggies for
middle market so right now we're working
on getting some tomatoes for a tomato
sauce where should we go grudge
like my favorite drink ever
and where you guys should see the view
from over here it's so funny I'm gonna
show
I know yours is better than mine I love
ya okay
who is Adam this you have in front of
you all of the pasta okay look one cup
of flour in the recipe
Alaura every one cup of flour
one egg yes for 150 I have two cups
step one the flower don't tell them what
the two steps are for making good food
Oh and then yep you have to crack it
with the desk no no that like that yeah
yeah good is it a hit of the earth
there you go now we need to make
together the egg guys you should see my
hands if they're still dirty
the guy told us no no this is our foe
can you know in this little Oh Baba
and little by little add flour with your
fork okay no old flour that's a little
bit of fun okay like yes when we become
like okay he said not all the flowers
now it's all like I know
so easy I'm gonna make this when I go
home handle with Tyler
my kids are never gonna eat I think pops
up from the box I'm always gonna make it
for them now that I know this is so cool
yeah cuz I was we're gonna pass every
night so I'll like Annie coming pasta
really a special occasion this is the
pasta that we need my computer camera is
about to die so I'm gonna try it really
quick and tell you guys how it is how is
it do you like it
it's amazing
so hi guys we're trying to find the bus
stop right now
chin is the most up this way hold on
we're lost one Zak all right so Gretchen
I think thought is to the bus stop
because I cannot navigate Google Maps
like I get confused which direction to
go in and she taught me that there's a
little blue arrow that you follow and it
like tells you which way you're facing
because I never know so I just try to
walk those random girls and see which
way it is on a road but then you enjoy
just rot it's the wrong way and then
we're like wait why is the bus that we
need to take like fault going the
opposite way and then we realized
because I brought us runaway but we are
gonna go back we're gonna go back into
town right now we actually went back
after the pasta-making class which I was
gonna show my camera died it was so
annoying because I have two batteries
just so that doesn't happen and ones
always charged so anyway we came back
after the possum in class we took a nap
and then what now we're here yeah so we
just put on some clothes
we're gonna go to I think the Trevi
Fountain right now and take some
pictures because it's literally so
beautiful during the day but for
Instagram it's so bright that we like
you can't take any photos we're going
for it so we're gonna go for Instagram
right now and we're gonna get gelato oh
we can read this scratching oh so sixty
tiny Salian but I think 63 is what we
want yeah it is okay well yeah stop
we finally I know it is we finally just
made it to the trevi fountain it's so
crowded right now like we were crowded
than it was yesterday which is weird
because it's like sunset I guess
everybody just knows when there's the
good lighting here like us so we're
gonna try to get close the difficulty
right now but like Gretchen is saying
where she thought that we came here in
reading code to the Colosseum yet
because we like it here and we're
nailing gelato and so pretty you guys
have seen this in my blog yesterday but
I'll show you a gallon and let's try to
get down in the front
it was way too crowded for us to take
pictures I'm here so I think we're go
back up to where we were yesterday just
so we can get just so we can get a
bigger better view of
but you're like trying to get through
or so we can't come here it's literally
like 6:00 in the morning
just like what
this place is so cute it's like the
gelato place right next to the target
fountain it's literally right across if
you ever come here and they have creates
waffles avato Gretchen really want to
create so we're gonna get hurt right now
there's so many flavors and I guess Edie
come to Italy in the geladas like this
where you scoop it out of the silver
things I guess it's better than if they
have it like piled up on the mound
that's a tip for you guys wanting to
take picture of it it melts so quick but
I got coffee and yogurt flavor it's so
good geez a Greek yogurt
and the coffee obviously tastes like
coffee
saitec it's like a breakfast one it's
like a breakfast gelato I don't like
that no ma'am what's it called NGO time

Nutella Oh No Oreos really go to some
bottom melon Oreos always go in here
