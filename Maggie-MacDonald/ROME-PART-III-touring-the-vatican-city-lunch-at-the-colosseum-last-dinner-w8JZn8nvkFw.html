Gotham City so we are gonna walk around
and go on tour there this morning which
should be interesting and yeah I'm
really excited to see what it looks like
and everything that's inside again gets
into nightclubs three hours last night
so I'm super tired but something
interesting about going here is that you
have to wear like clothing that covers
your shoulders and also your knees so I
had to put on this really long dress
this isn't what I wanted to wear today
so I have to bring my backpack and then
I am going to change into
so we just finished our tour at the
Vatican City of the Vatican City I think
that's how they say but we are gonna go
into Rome right now like the actual city
part and walk around and go back to
across the image take some pictures and
get lunch and gelato and hang out but it
was really fun I liked seeing everything
it was so interesting and like the
artwork was absolutely beautiful but I
didn't want to like talk too much in
there so that's why I kind of just took
videos and showed you guys so I hope
that you got an idea of what it looks
like and if you ever come to Rome I
definitely recommend going there I'm so
sad that we didn't get more time to
spend in Rome and it's so pretty here I
feel like I feel like our time was kind
of like a limit oh hi I feel like our
time was limited here just because we
didn't have a lot of free time we did a
lot of Tours yeah maybe that would have
been the same in the other cities if we
actually went to the tours so me too
because we had like two full days I
loved it
me too I love this area right here we're
going to stop and take some pictures
we're getting on our bus but look guys
there's literally palm trees in the
middle of this little park and Tyson was
like yeah we have palm trees here and I
just thought it was a cool thing this
reminds me of like Boston Common and we
finally found a shady place to wave her
and the bus was supposed to be here I
had 11:33 and its 1138
so either the bus is really late or the
bus activity coming that's I don't
really like public transportation like I
said does they get so much easier to
just walk or grab the talk to these they
get so confused at buses and stuff but
I'm so glad that I have Fried Chicken
with me right now because
as a graduate literally so
Mack had a brown eye
but then like instead of going right on
the street that when you talk to those
elderly leather biker honestly like I
better right
we go so hard or it may come around
yeah
naca pictures here because yesterday
when you get to obviously
and we didn't want to like bacon Swede
we made it okay now we need to find
somewhere to sit so we can get a good
view I think we're gonna try to sit over
here look how cool it is like you cannot
say that that's not the coolest thing
you've ever seen
Wow that thing's been here for so long
it took eight years to build
I think that's insane guys look what I
got I'm so excited
and my pizza came to Gretchen's didn't
yet but I just got the cookies and then
that's with my outfit my drink does and
they gave me two strands
this bread is really good on my feet up
I feel like a house I can go get to it
but just has tomato monster I love basil
hey guys so we're on our way to dinner
now after lunch and everything crunching
tonight went back to the hotel and I
actually stuck for like three hours just
because I'm so tired
Oh God and you're so people and the
destruction like tried to pack a little
bit well I was thinking but really just
gonna do over get home but I'm gonna try
to vlog a lot about dinner just because
I haven't really been vlogging at the
dinners to show you guys Inc you think
you want to come on one of these trips
like see what it's like well as we're
walking I just wanted to tell you guys a
little bit about our trip just because a
lot of you have been like leaving
comments and messaging me on Instagram
and having like so many questions about
it and I just want to smell you guys
like in the video so I can address about
one and so we are in this trip with
chemistry and we are on the Venice
Florence Rome trip and it's so much fun
it's literally the most amazing trip
I've ever been on
and we meet what's been your favorite
City I I don't know if you like all the
different cities like have such a
different vibe but I blow Rome and I
love foreign and I love that is for the
photos like I don't know they're all
just so different and I just think this
trip is like something that I like I
don't know I'm just like so happy I went
on it and I feel like coming with you so
cold yeah ultimate break it's just like
the best way to go abroad if you've
never gone abroad before because they
literally have like all of your stuff
planned for you like you go on tours you
eat different meals you
different event you have a tour guide
all of your plates and all of your hotel
and literally every single like
transportation is included in the price
you pay so please be like you pay once
and then everything's included which i
think is so nice if you don't want to
worry about like figuring out where to
say you don't have to worry about oh
well I'm going to this city like I want
to see all these things like your tour
guide literally for you exactly and if
you don't speak the language like they
help you and it's so helpful
because I just feel like it can be very
intimidating going to a different
country when you've never been before
like me so I feel like it was so nice
that I like got to come on this trip
because they helped me so much and they
made my experience so amazing so I have
a code for you guys actually Maggie 100
I'll have it on the screen and you can
use my link below to get $100 off your
trip and like I said before Gretchen and
I are on the Venice Florence Rome trip

you can click the link you can look out
everything we did and there's literally
so many other ones like there's 1 2
degrees
Islands and we're like go to that we're
gonna be going that one I think it was
so much fun that I like one up and
another one and I feel like it's perfect
- if you're like going with a friend or
even like boyfriend/girlfriend and you
like need some guidance on what to do I
highly recommend playing with this
company just because I know it's
literally like stress-free yeah and it's
also easy and we've met such great
people and we've just had the best time
ever last dinner in Italy I got there
you know he was the tomato basil sauce
that you got there suddenly no I feel
like this will show you but I Drive the
trip is every time like dang it looks so
good I'm gonna try it oh my god this
lady really like the cover right here so
one thing that when you wait for your
food I wait for everybody to eat they
want you to eat it right away because
our secret if you let it
oh my god my hair so messy we just
finished her dinner and it was so good
it was so like sad because Tyson was
talking about all the stuff that we do
on the trip it was really emotional like
I'm gonna miss it here but it's all good
because now I know that like I love it
here so much and I definitely want to
and that we really can way back to Rome
and they feel like it'll be good now
because we can like get our hotels I
want to stay in the city and I wanted to
stay somewhere that's like literally
right in the city yeah and like close to
everything and when I go to Venice I
want to stay right in Venice just to
like you're right near everything you
can walk around everywhere and like not
have to worry about like transportation
here coming in close to the Trevi
Fountain cause you like we're only on my
own half two miles yeah but a guide
rather than explode be like a close
close that's what I want to do too
so now I'm going to go back to Boston
and literally eat healthy for the next
like we eat until we go on our next trip

we're gonna go I think there's one
somewhere around here though no no no
what's it called Vespa
they rode one on Gossip Girl oh when
Serena and Dan went on the date they
wrote a Vespa his books a different
ideas for the moped let us know oh yeah
I have no idea but the episode was in
Serena and Dan went on a date and he
like saved up all of his money till I
get her car serviced what so anyway yeah
Serena and Dan went on a date and he
like sated with all his money to get a
car service for her because he thought
like oh this girl has so much money like
that's all she likes as a car service
and she went outside and saw the best
spot on the side of the road was like oh
my god Dan like a Vespa this is the best
day of my life like this is gonna be so
fun grab the helmet he went to get on
and he was like oh like that's not our
car and then like the car service pulled
up and open the door and she was like oh
cuz she like didn't want to go in the
car with the car service she like wanted
to own the Loki Vespa with Dan I'm gonna
watch it as I can watch it after I knew
all the things that we have to do and
then we can I want to re-watch all Gus

bored I had nothing to do so all I did
was watch her grow really yeah if I hear
