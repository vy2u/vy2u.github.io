talk about my level of contendere Oh
but I need to show you guys the pool
that we're at right now this place is
literally so nice and it's so quiet and
I'm like so content right now
but I'll show you a little overview I
like what it looks like this is where we
decide just sit up here on this little
sand thing but the pool is like this
really really cool like rectangle thing
that's kind of raised up and then you
walk over here and the ground is like
turf it's like what I used to play field
hockey and it's so nice it's like grass
and then it's on the roof overlooking
the water Miami it's so pretty there's
like over a bar and all of these seats
that's Kaley right now hello first so
much but anyway the water's so warm it
feels like a song it feels like a
up but we decided to sit up here it's so
nice literally even the bathroom this
place is so pretty like a look at this
look at the view from the bathroom
that's crazy but I feel like when you go
inside on vacation does this happen up
to anybody else you like go inside and
then you get to like actually see how
tan you're getting because what I feel
like I'm getting like crispy and that's
exactly like what I want right now

my little butt
that turbo right now is like getting a
little snack to 13 and
thank Santos breakfast but I think I'm
gonna get like a kind bar I love coming
inside after her being outside all day

can't notice how tan you are when you're
actually in the Sun you know what I mean

I do but I really needed to eat a quick
snack because I was really hungry
