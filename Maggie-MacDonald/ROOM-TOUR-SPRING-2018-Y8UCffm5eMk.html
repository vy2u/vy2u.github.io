you're new here my name is Maggie and in
today's video I'm gonna be showing you
guys my room and this video has been so
highly requested everybody's like Maggie
like do a room tour do a room tour and
now that it is springtime I decided that
I would redo my room and just add a
couple things into it just because it
was feeling so dull and like not cozy
from winter I if you guys know what I
mean like I just needed like some spring
cleaning and he just to organize
everything get some new accessories pick
up some new things and I already had a
room tour on my channel from a few
months ago so this one is the updated
one and I always get questions like to
show my room and stuff so I just thought
that I would do that today and you're
probably like why are you sitting on the
ground like that but this lighting was
really good and I don't know you can see
some of my room in the back so without
further ado let's get started with the
video and I hope you guys enjoy
so this is my room right as you walk in
and I'll start over here so this area
right here next to the door is like my
desk area and like where I do all of my
work editing my videos and stuff so I
just have this desk from Ikea
and it just has a big drawer right here
and then a smaller drawer and then a
door that opens up with some shelves
inside which is really nice and there's
a lot of storage that's mainly what I
was looking for when I was buying my
desk and then I have this white chair
from Target and then also this gold
trashcan from Target as well and then I
just have my little backpack on the back
of my chair and I've been obsessed with
this backpack lately I'll have it linked
down below for you guys just because
it's amazing and it's super cute and
then on top of my desk I just have these
little marble coasters I think I got
them from home goods or t.j.maxx and
then I just have my Starbucks water
bottle and also some fake flowers and
then I have my desktop computer and my
Apple watch just charging in my
cellphone obviously and then above my
desk I have this cork board that I got
from Target actually it's not really
like cork board it's kind of like um has
burlap on the top but you can like stick
pins into it as you can see I just got a
bunch of gold hooks from Target and then
put all of my long necklaces and some
hoops and then I have like my wallet and
keys hanging on there as well
just so it's super easy to grab those
like when I'm running out the door and
then over here in the corner section I
just have these Alex drawers from Ikea
and these are where I hold all of my
makeup and lip products and like nail
polishes beauty products literally
everything you could ever think of is in
these Alex drawers and on the top I just
have these glass jars from Target and
these ones obviously hold q-tips and
these ones hold cotton pads and then I
have this marble and gold container from
Target as well that just has a bunch of
rings and earrings and stuff
there and then this little thing in the
back is from Target and it's kind of
like a piece of coral and it has marble
on the bottom as you can tell probably
from my room the theme is basically like
white and marble and like gold and so
this has a bunch of jewelry on it as
well some of the things that I decided
not to put on my board right here I just
kept it on this and the reason why I got
the board with the jewelry was because
this got way too full so I needed
something else that was gonna like hold
all my necklaces and pieces like that
and then above this shelving area right
here I just have some photos of the most
important people in my life so I have a
picture of me and my best friend Molly
right here and then I have a photo of me
and my best friend Marcus and this is me
and Emma from her birthday last summer
and then this is a picture of my
boyfriend Tyler playing football and
then this is my best friend B and then
right here is my best friend at Kaylee
as you guys know you from Kaylee from
the vlogs and then down here I have a
little tray with like my favorite
perfumes and my favorite lip products
and also this photo right here that says
the cure for anything is salt water
sweat tears or the sea
and this tray that I got right here is
from Target as well and I have these
really cute Penrose roll-on perfumes on
top of the tray
and then I have my favorite perfumes
from Anthropologie which are just the
vanilla ones and then I really have been
loving this body spray in the back which
is like the Brazilian crush brand from
Sephora as you guys know like the
Brazilian bum bum cream I just got that
at Sephora from their line it smells
really really really good and then this
is my favorite lip product right here
it's just the lynnae's lip mask I have
it on my lips right now and it's super
hydrating and it feels really good on
your lips so I highly recommend getting
this I wear it during the day and at
night I think you can really like get
away with doing both and then I also
have this candle right here which smells
amazing I'll show you guys the front of
it it is canyon sunrise and it is from
Target I love Target I feel like they
have the best like things for your room
and then I just have a little dust bag
from Gucci that holds my Gucci bag
that's hanging on my closet door and
then obviously Mary Lou's coffee you
guys know I'm obsessed so going into my
shelves there are nine shelves on this
little like cube container thing and the
first one right here just has a book and
it is called rose a all day and Emma
actually got me that for Christmas
and then on top of the book I just have
a little Buddha and some coconut rose
water spray like to spray at my face or
hydrate it if I need it and then in this
cube right here I just have my face
brush from vanity plate it and then some
face wash that I'm going to be using and
then in this cube I have a silver frame
I don't know why I was just drawing the
blank but I have this silver frame that
I'm gonna be putting a picture of got
Gina and I from Coachella in and then I
have these really cute forever 21
sunglasses and then in this one that is
just an oil diffuser in case I like want
to relax and like put some lavender oil
in there or whatever I have that and
then this thing right here is just a
little cool decoration that I got from
Target as well and then
I have these two big windows in my room
with these curtains I don't know where
they're from my mom caught them but
they're just plain white and then this
is my bed you guys are gonna kill me for
this but my bed used to be like pushed
over next to the wall and then the other
day I decided to move it back over a
little bit and give myself some room in
between the wall and my bed just so it
would be easier to make my bed so that's
why my monogram above my bed is not
centered and I noticed that before I was
gonna film this video but I was like you
know what I don't feel like taking it
off the wall and like moving it over and
sticking it back on just because I have
moved it so many times that I feel like
the tape that's like on the back
wouldn't stick anymore so I just left it
don't hate me but this is just what my
bed looks like for an overview and the
initials on the top I got that from Etsy
like a long long time ago when I was
going into college so if you want to get
something similar to that I always get
questions about it I would just type in
on Etsy like wooden monogram wall decal
that's what I did and then I got one in
the mail that looks like this and I
spray painted it black so that is what I
did and then this is just my bed right
here I got this white ruffle duvet cover
from Pottery Barn and then also my
pillowcases are from Pottery Barn as
well and then these three pillows on the
front of my bed are just decorative
pillows that I just got from Target and
then I have my little dog right there
and these ones are super cute I like how
they're not like it completely white
like my bedding they're kind of like an
off-white cream color I think it just
adds a nice little touch and then this
is my bedside table I just have a little
layup from TJ Maxx or home goods one of
those and then next to my bad I have my
favorite anthropology candle it smells
so good I'm obsessed with it and then I
also have some aqua for just because I
put it on my lips every night before I
go to bed and then obviously I have like
my phone charger and stuff next to my
bed and then on the back of my door I
just have this little thing that is
hanging all of my hats and I have a
bunch of like SoulCycle bags and an
urban outfitters bag too
hanging on the back there as well just
super easy to hold things that don't
like fit in my closet I think
that this little thing right here from
Target is really useful and I put my
towels on the back of it as well oh and
another thing I wanted to tell you guys
about my bed is that I'm getting a
headboard and bed frame I just don't
know where I'm getting it from yet but
I've been looking online for one and I
just ordered a new mattress which I will
show you guys a little clip of be
unboxing it right here so what is it so
this is a Lisa mattress and I just
ordered this online it just came in the
mail
and I slept on Lisa twice in my life
when I was in California if you guys
watched those vlogs I talked about hot
stuff really good that night and it was
on ELISA mattress and then Gretchen also
has a Lisa mattress and whenever I go to
her school and sleepover at the U I
always have the best Lynx leaves ever
because her bed is so comfortable and
everybody always sleeps in her bed and
she literally told me she's like Maggie
at the first time I ever got my Lisa I
slept for 13 hours straight and I was
like I need one like I sleep so good
when I go to her school I slept so good
when I was in California when I slept on
ELISA and I was like what am I missing
out on
I need ELISA and one thing that I found
out about Lisa is that they donate one
mattress to shelters for every 10
mattresses that are purchased and I also
have a code for you guys you guys can
use my code Maggie McDonald she would
get $100 off your Lisa mattress if you
guys want one and basically what it is
is it is a huge mattress that comes in
this big box so I'm gonna go ahead and
unpack it for you guys and as you would
see since you are like looking at my
room tour video right now my room is
really small so I was gonna like unpack
it when I was in my room but I don't
have room for that so I'm in my like I
don't know what you even want to call
this part of my apartment it's like my
living room but my kitchen so like
basically the main like area of my
apartment that's right I am right now
and that's where I'm gonna unpack this
baby so I just thought that I would show
you guys
how it like opens up and stop okay so it
has some instructions on the inside for
unboxing it so setting up your Lisa
unbox position unwrap expand oh my god
this is so funny there's a huge mattress
in here oh and I think one of the
coolest things about Lisa is that your
mattress literally gets brought right to
your door they ship it to you they bring
it right out to wherever you live
that's so cool like you don't have to
worry about like anything
here we go wait this is so funny my
mattress is like raising up now this is
so cool I can sleep on it
my mattress oh my god fall asleep right
now I can't laying on it for too long
but as you guys can see it just raised
up like normally and now it's just a big
comfy fluffy mattress oh my gosh I'm so
obsessed I can't wait to sleep on this
so I'm gonna end up taking my mattress
out of my room that is at my apartment
obviously right here right now and I'm
gonna be bringing that mattress with me
to Cape Cod for the summer just because
I am gonna be home for the summer and I
live on Cape Cod as you guys know
something to be bringing my mattress
here back home we'll be able to have a
bed at home and then I will have this
matches for at my apartment at school so
I'm gonna be putting my new mattress
obviously where my bed is right now once
I get a headboard and frame and I'm
super excited for that so I'm just gonna
show you guys a little overview of my
room like from the corner so obviously
we have my bed my side table which is
from Target I don't know if I said that
and then we have my little desk area and
my shelves with my Alex drawers my
little rug and you come over back around
to my closet doors so my room isn't big
at all but I designed it in a way
designed it I set it up in a way that
was gonna be like the most efficient for
me and I could get the most space out of
it so this is just what it looks like
right here so that concludes my room
