today's video I'm going to be filming a
snapchat Q&amp;amp;A on my Instagram story and
my live streams and Tumblr and stuff I
asked you guys to send in all of your
questions that you have for me to my
snapchat if you don't already have me on
snapchat you should totally add me my
username is just at Maggie McDonald and
I post stories all the time I'm always
posting stuff like my food I am a
snapchat foodie I always post my food
like what I'm doing things like that so
if you don't have me on snapchat you
should totally add me and without
further ado let's get started so the
first question is from lil Mogan and it
is what is your favorite brand my
favourite brand right now definitely
would have to be Urban Outfitters and
brandy melville I love that vibe right
now I just feel like it's so chill and
relaxed and comfy especially like for
the fall and winter I just love being
comfortable and cozy when I'm going out
like getting dressed so those are
definitely my favorite brands right now
the next question is from Jill Hogan and
she is wondering if I will ever do a
Boston meetup I've been thinking about
doing a Boston meetup that would
definitely be so much fun so maybe I'll
do something on Newbury Street and a
range like one Sunday to have like a
little Boston meetup where we can all
meet up and take pictures and stuff like
that I think it would be so much fun the
next question is from EMR three four
five and she asked what college you go
to and how did you decide to go there
with her little favorite snot filter um
the college I go to is Bridgewater State
University and Bridgewater Massachusetts
and the reason why I chose to go here
was because it is an in-state school I'm
from Massachusetts so it's a lot cheaper
to go here rather than going to a school
that's private
so I would here based on how much it
cost I just kind of wanted to go to a
school where it was more affordable so
that's why I chose to come here and
Michelle Kilgore asked what are your top
five winter fashion must-haves I don't
want to get into that in this video but
I think that's a great question and if
you guys would be interested in seeing a
video about my top 5 winter fashion
must-haves just give this video a thumbs
up and I can definitely do like a
lookbook and put together something like
that for you Jessica Lindau asked who is
your biggest inspiration PS I love you
and obsessed with you I love you too and
my biggest inspiration would definitely
have to be my mom
my mom is
the kindest most loving genuine person
ever and I love her so much
and I would probably have to look up to
her she's my biggest inspiration but
definitely both of my parents are my
inspirations life so shout out to them
they're the best I think that they did a
great job raising me my brother my
sister and I just think that they are
just kind people and I don't know like
they just want to be able to grow up and
be able to raise my kids away that they
raised me the next question that I got
from Skyler Matt Shoeless was what
series Apple watch do you have and I get
this question a lot and I have these
series on Apple watch I have the gold
one with kind of like a cream color band
but I don't have any of the new ones I
just don't think that it's practical for
me to spend more money to have a watch
that's waterproof I would never go
swimming with it on or I don't swim I
don't really do any activities where it
would get wet so I just have the regular
series one the next question is how many
days a week do I work out and I work out
as much as I can as much as I can fit it
into my schedule I used to work out five
to six days a week I was on this crazy
workout schedule I don't do that anymore
this week I think I only worked out
twice but and last week I worked out
like four times I'm not really that
strict on working out anymore it's more
of what I put into my body and what I
eat so I just work out when I have time
I like to work out like three to four
times a week and usually when I work out
I do cardio the next question is what is
my favorite healthy snack my favorite
healthy snack would definitely have to
be banana with peanut butter I love
bananas and peanut butter um like cut up
vegetables I love cutting up tomatoes
and cucumbers and putting in a bowl and
putting balsamic vinegar on top I'm
gonna go this one my favorites and I
love just any cut-up fresh fruit I love
pineapple mango raspberries strawberries
all of that I don't really like
cantaloupe or honeydew but I like kind
of fresh fruit cut outs vegetables
bananas and peanut butter and those
would definitely have to be my favorites
next question is what are some of your
favorite songs you guys can follow me on
Spotify if you want to see all my
favorite songs I have a bunch of
different playlists up there with all
songs that I'm listening to right now my
Spotify is MDM McDonald's I'll have it
all linked down below but you guys
should totally follow me on Spotify that
where I update like all my playlists and
music and things I'm loving I have a
playlist called fall 2017 and that's all
the music that I'm listening to right
now so you should totally go check that
out the next question is where would you
like to travel to the most um I have two
places where I'd like to travel to the
most I would definitely go to Bora Bora
that has always been my dream to go to
like Tahiti or Bora Bora and stay in one
of those little Hut's right on the water
that is my absolute dream when I was
younger I always used to see them go
there on the Bachelorette so that's a
place that I've always wanted to go to
and also I would also love to go to
Santorini Greece or anywhere in Greece
with all of like the white buildings in
just the blue water I think that's
absolutely gorgeous and it would be
totally amazing to go there so that's
definitely somewhere that is on my wish
list of a place that I want to go to the
next question I got asked is what are my
top five favorite stores I kind of went
over this in the beginning but I like
brandy melville Urban Outfitters
Lululemon forever 21 and one more
made well I'm not make sure I really
only shop at like Urban Outfitters right
now
Lululemon in forever 21 actually all
those are my favorite stores right now
next question I got is what college do I
go to in my major I just went over what
college i go to i go to Bridgewater
State University in Massachusetts and my
major is marketing next question
favorite chapstick and lip balm right
now I actually have a right here I'm
loving this little glam glow lip mud
mask um actually it's called wet lip but
this is the little thing that I'm loving
right now it just comes in this little
sphere and then the inside looks like
that I really love it I just think that
it's so soothing and glowy and it's
really minty which I like because it
starting to get really cold out so when
it's cold outside I like to put
something minty on my lips the next
question is how often do you come home
and spend the weekend at home slash the
Cape I haven't been home in like a month
I don't think but I don't really go home
that often I do live in an apartment by
myself well I have a roommate but I live
in my own apartment back at school so I
like being in my apartment and just like
being in my own space with my room and
my computer and everything and like
around my friends I do love going home
don't get me wrong but I don't go at
home as often as I used to like when I
was younger like when I was a freshman
but I think all together total I've been
home like three times so far and I'll
obviously go home for Thanksgiving and
the last question that I'm gonna answer
I get this question so much is what is
my Starbucks order and I have a bunch of
different orders honestly at Starbucks
it's whatever I'm in the mood for so
these are my top favorite orders from
Starbucks I like getting almond milk
cappuccinos um what else do I like I
like getting mint tea I usually just get
a venti mint tea like unsweetened and I
get the Jade citrus mint or the mint
majesty I think the mint Majesties the
one that I really like though and then
the next thing that I get is I'm just
like a plain black iced coffee then my
last one that I get is a chai tea so I
get the chai tea bags with like hot
water and then I get steamed
almond milk in it so those are my top
four favorite drinks from Starbucks so
that concludes my little snapchat Q&amp;amp;A
those questions were the ones that I
most frequently got asked so I just
decided to put those ones in there I
have so many more I just didn't want to
