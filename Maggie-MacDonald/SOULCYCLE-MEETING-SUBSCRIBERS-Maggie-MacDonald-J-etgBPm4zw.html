I don't know I just feel like I've been
them emotionally they've owned this home
like process because since I am
uploading everything today like trying
to put out there as much content as I
can I just feel like sometimes it gets
overwhelming and it's a lot and it
really takes a lot out of you because it
is like something that you need to
commit to and I don't know it just like
sometimes makes me over well because I
feel like I don't have enough time and
like just there's so many different
things but like meeting you guys and
like talking to you and like hearing
what you have to say and that like
you've watched my videos and stuff like
that is honestly just like so makes my
heart so happy and the reason why like
you were so staring but and I don't know
I just wanted to I can hold it but I
just want to say like thank you for like
supporting me and stuff I don't know it
just makes me so happy so I just got out
of the shower I just got home from soul
cycle and my little shopping trip
I'm with Jillian and sorry I just need
to brush my hair you know so I just left
that I would sit down and like brush my
hair and talk to you guys a little bit
and end off the vlog I wanted to show
you some of the things that I got so
I'll get into that my camera's been like
not focusing lately I don't know why but
I think my self tanner came in the mail
today which I really need because I am
so white and yeah you can see right now
I'm so pale so I just think I'm gonna go
down and get the mail after this and go
answer some questions on tumblr and also
edit this vlog and put it up but let me
get chopped psych hold on as I was
saying I just wanted to show you
everything that I got today I just
wanted to keep this vlog like super
casual in real because obviously like I
want to be 100% with you guys I'm not
gonna be wearing makeup all the time
like I want to show you like what it was
like like my life this kind of like a
Saturday in my life
now that I think of it um this is just
like what I normally do on days that I
don't have school or like have a lot of
free time so I picked up some things at
Legacy Place and I got the birthday gift
from Sephora and I picked out this
little tart package and it came with a
little lip gloss and a blush so I'm
gonna open these up and see like what
they look like because I use the Tarte
blush right now this one's called party
that's so cute oh my god I love this
color it's really different than the one
that I use right now I use um Tarte
glisten Oh Gillian just texted me she's
so cute and then I also got this little
lip paint it doesn't say oh this one's
called birthday suit that's cute
birthday suiting party um that's cute
so I picked that up when I was at
Sephora I was checking out when the girl
was like you know birthday gift and I
was like oh my god okay forget that my
birthday's on Tuesday but so I got that
then the most exciting thing ever I was
obviously went to SoulCycle this morning
and in the bathroom they had all of
these fresh beauty products and I picked
up the rose floral toner and it is just
infused with susan soothing rose water
hydrates and refreshes so basically you
can use it as a toner or like a facial
spray and I usually use the Mario
Badescu rose water spray and yes don't
hate me I am NOT obsessed with it
I don't know if it just happens to me
but when I spray my face I feel like it
leaves like a heavy dewy feeling on it
like I don't feel refreshed I do feel
like the first second and then it's like
I don't really know how to describe it
so I have this huge thing of the Mario
Badescu rose water and they're still
like actually wait is there a lot left
well probably like half of the bottle
left I have that one and I also have
this cucumber one and I don't know I
just feel like I don't like them that
much I know everybody else likes them so
I thought that like oh my god they're
amazing everyone loves them like I need
to use it too
that's not the case for me because I
found this one today and it's literally
so amazing it was really expensive like
44 I think was $40 or 44 but whatever it
was like $40 for this bottle which I
know was a lot I really understand that
but it's so refreshing oh oh my god it
just feels like I don't even know how to
describe it but it's just like a feeling
I've never felt before like I've used so
many different facial sprays and this
one just feels so light and airy it
almost feels like powdery I don't really
know how to describe it so I picked this
up from Sephora I also got I don't know
if you saw my haul from a little while
ago but I got these pinky rings from
Madewell and they're so cute
so I got a new size and those because I
ended up getting ones that were too big
for me the time before so I brought
those back got new ones so I have ones
in my size now and they will like come
off or anything then I also got this new
necklace I'll show you close up it is
just this gold chain with this little
hem saw Hamza I don't know really how to
pronounce it where are my keys I have a
keychain from Anthropologie on my car
keys that has this little hand on it and
it means something it means like
surround yourself with I don't really
remember but I don't know it like means
it has some meaning to it but I saw this
they really liked it just the opal I
thought it was so cute and dainty and I
also got a real gold necklace that says
Scorpio because that is my zodiac but
I'm just waiting for that to come in the
mail so I'm definitely to be wearing
these two together I love this look
right now like the dainty gold jewelry
but I just wanted to sit down show you
what I got and this vlog here I hope
that you guys enjoyed this video and it
was so nice meeting my few subscribers
that I met today I had the most amazing
day ever I'm so genuinely happy
right now I just feel like I'm finally
like coming to a really good place in my
life and I just wanted to tell you guys
that your happiness in the way that you
feel like you have complete control over
it um just some things that I've learned
in the past is that like you don't have
to please everybody and not everyone's
gonna accept your decisions and not
everybody is going to agree with them
not everyone's gonna have the same
mindset as you but that's okay because
you're your own person and this is your
life and you need to start doing things
for yourself because um for me I have
always been a people pleaser I just want
everybody to be happy I want everyone to
like like me and not have like a problem
with me but I have to sometimes you just
have to sit down and realize that like
your happiness is what's most important
in your life and you can't please
everybody so that's just something that
I've came to realize lately and I don't
know I just think I'm in a really good
place in my life I just feel like I've
been getting such positive feedback from
you guys on YouTube and especially the
few subscribers that I have met and
people who say that they see me and run
into me come up to me and say hi I do
this for you and I want to meet you guys
and I want to talk to you and put a face
to a name like if you comment on my
videos I want to be able to meet you
face-to-face and I can introduce myself
and have a conversation and I don't know
I don't just like made me so happy like
meeting you guys today and it just
really warmed my heart and made me
realize like why I'm doing this because
I will admit that it gets hard at times
because it's a lot to upload every
single day and always be putting content
out there and just making videos and
making sure that you guys are gonna like
when I put on on for you to watch and it
can be stressful and it can be
pressuring but I need to stop and
remember why I do it
and honestly I came here on YouTube to
just connect with you and share my
passion for things and build friendships
and build a community and a family and I
just want to sit down and say thank you
and personally thank each and every one
of you and let you guys know how
appreciative I am of
you and I don't know I've been talking
for nine minutes I need to probably stop
because this is gonna be a lot to edit
but I just want to sit down and all in
all over everything I said thank you so
much for your support it means the
absolute world to me I cannot thank you
enough I am doing this for you guys so
you are the best I love your comments on
my videos I love interacting with you I
love getting messages from you so don't
be shy I want to be friends with you I
want to build a community build a family
and yeah so this is just the beginning
of all of this if you're not subscribed
please subscribe like comment do all of
that I just feel like I'm in such a good
place in my life right now when I'm
finally doing something that I love and
to be able to spend it with you guys and
have you guys there with me along the
way means the absolute world so with
that being said thank you so much for
watching this video and I will see you
in my next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
