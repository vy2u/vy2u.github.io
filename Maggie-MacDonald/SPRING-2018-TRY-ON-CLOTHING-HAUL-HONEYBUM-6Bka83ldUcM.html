today's video I have any other honey bum
haul for you and all of these items that
I picked out are super cute and perfect
for the springtime and I'm absolutely
obsessed with them I picked out some
really great pieces I'm so excited to
share them with you guys so without
further ado let's get started so the
first item is just this black bodysuit
with these gold snaps up the front and
it is kind of straight across in
spaghetti strap this fits so well I got
it any size small I believe yes and this
size small and it fits so so so well and
I love the material it's so soft I know
that this is gonna be one of my staples
in my closet for the springtime just
because it's super easy to throw on you
can wear it with high-waisted shorts you
can wear it with jeans you can wear with
joggers literally anything I'm so
obsessed with it and honestly I didn't
have something like this in my closet
before so I was really really happy to
pick this up and the next item that I
got is just another bodysuit and this
one is a nude colored one and it is
again just straight across with little
spaghetti straps I got this in a size
small and it's kind of small on me I
think that this one definitely runs a
bit small so if you are the same size as
me I definitely would recommend sizing
up in it I wish that I got a medium but
this is perfect and if you guys want to
wear like high-waisted pants with it
that's what I recommend just because the
sides of it go a little bit higher on
your hip so you definitely have to be
wearing something high-waisted with this
but I think that this bodysuit is so
cute for the springtime and it's
definitely a staple to have just because
of how neutral it is and you can
literally or wear it with anything so I
definitely think that this is gonna be
one of my favorites in my closet this
spring and the next item that I got is
just this cute little light pink set and
it comes with this little tank top right
here and it kind of has this ribbed
detailing on the bottom wait what is
this called it has a name it's like
scalloped edge almost I don't know what
it is but it's really cute and it is
kind of a knit ribbed material just like
that and then it also comes with this
really cute bodycon skirt and it is
completely matching so you can wear it
as a
set you could definitely wear this tank
top alone which I'm probably gonna end
up doing and I got this in a size small
and then I also got another set from
honey bomb and it's just this navy blue
set and I got it in a size small as well
and it comes with this little tank top
with these ruffles on the bottom and
then these really high waisted tight
kind of capri pants and again they're
just the same knit stretchy rubbed
material and then the bottoms of it have
these really cute flared out ruffles and
it kind of is like a cropped length so
it's gonna be super cute to wear with
like some gold jewelry and some nude
heels I'm really excited I think that
sets are gonna be a huge trend this
spring so I'm super excited that I
picked this one up it's gonna be super
cute and it's also really really
comfortable which I love you guys know
I'm all about looking cute but also
being comfortable so if you guys are
looking for something like that I
definitely recommend that you check out
this set and then I just picked up two
tank tops and I got this one in a size
medium it's just this white plain tank
top with this racerback detailing on the
back and this one honestly is one of my
favorite tank tops it is a bit
see-through so I would recommend wearing
like a sticky boobs under it or a little
Bruntlett or something and this tank top
is just the perfect material it is so
cozy it's so comfy and I think it's
super cute with like high-waisted
joggers you can really wear with
anything and it's definitely great
staple to have in your closet
the next thing tuff I got is just the
one that I'm wearing right now it's just
this tan color and it has this little
tied detailing in the front and this one
is a bit thicker so I didn't actually
have to wear a bra with it you guys are
always asking me like which bra they
wear with my tank top and stuff and this
one I'm actually not wearing anything at
all but it is super cute I picked it up
any size small and I loved it so much I
wish that they made it in different
colors I'm gonna go on the website later
and see if they do just because I like
it that much and it fits so well I
definitely want to get it in more colors
I think I'm gonna be wearing it a ton of
spring the next item is my absolute
favorite thing of this whole entire haul
like I'm obsessed with this and I wanted
to wear it to Miami last week but I was
like you know what I need to save it for
the haul but it's this bomber jacket oh
my god it kind of reminds me of the
Gucci print from last year when they
came out with the blue floral print and
the pink floral print
but it's just this blue floor print
bomber jacket with this blue and white
stripe detailing down the arm and this
is so cute and it's so soft it's the
perfect lightweight material for spring
and I know I'm gonna be getting a ton of
use out of it and wearing it so much but
I absolutely love this you guys need to
get it it's literally my favorite bomber
jacket ever and I also picked this up in
a size small and the next item I got is
just this body contrast and it is this
oatmeal cream-colored and it kind of has
this ribbed detailing on it and it's
straight across with just two little
spaghetti straps and I bought this in a
size small it is kind of see-through so
I would recommend wearing like sticky
boobs under it or like new colored
underwear just because you can kind of
see through it but I think that it's
super cute with like a denim jacket this
spring and maybe a pair of sneakers and
some gold jewelry I think that you
everybody it should have like a plain
bodycon dress in their closet and I've
been really loving this nude neutral
color lately I don't know I just think
that like it looks so good when you have
a nice tan and some gold jewelry on so
definitely highly recommend this dress
right here last but not least you guys
know I'm obsessed with joggers I have to
pick up a pair of joggers from honey bum
and these are just this grey pair with
this striped detailing off the bottom
again it's that oatmeal color that I've
been loving and I got these in a size
medium and they actually are kind of
tight on me so I definitely recommend to
size up in these just because they run a
bit small but I'm gonna still keep
wearing them and they're super cute and
perfect for the springtime just because
I love the detailing on the bottom the
little stripes and especially the
drawstring right here I think that it
adds a super cute touch just because
they're not your plain typical grey pair
of joggers like my brandy melville ones
that I always wear these ones are super
cute and I'm gonna be definitely wearing
them a ton with slides and stuff like
that so that concludes my haul video for
