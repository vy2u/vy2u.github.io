today's video I have another try on haul
for you I got all of these items that
I'm about to show you on doh if you guys
don't know what do't is it is a shopping
app it is basically the mobile mall it's
absolutely amazing I'm obsessed with it
you guys know it's my favorite you can
follow me on do't I will have my profile
link down below as well as my code which
is just Maggie and that will give you a
5 dollar credit once you sign up to any
store that you want on their app they
have so many different ones to choose
from and the thing that I love about
donut is that you can literally pick
anything you want from any store and
then it's basically a one-click thing
and then you buy all those items at once
and they all get shipped to you so you
don't have to go through and go to all
the separate different websites and all
that it's just so convenient and if
you're a shopper like me and have an
addiction it is the best app in the
whole entire world so I will have all of
their information linked down below and
also all of the items that I will be
showing you are on my profile I have a
board called don't Hall and it is with
all these items right here so if you
want to buy them you can just go right
to my profile and click on the don't
Hollis and then add all the items to
your cart so without further ado let's
get started with the video so the first
item I want to show you guys is this
dress and I got all these items I don't
know if I mentioned it before but they
all are princess Polly which is my new
obsession I love that store and this is
just the Polly brand and I got it in a
size 8 I really should have sized up and
got a 10 so that would have been a u.s.
medium it is this black dress and it's
really tight fitted at the top which I
love and then it really flares out at
the bottom it reminds me of the red one
that Selena Gomez were a couple years
ago that like iconic red dress that you
are that's tight at the top and then
flares out at the bottom it's just a
little bit too short on the bottom for
me because I am five six so I do
recommend sizing up at it if you are
taller but I think that this just is so
adorable it fits so well and it's so so
so cute if you have an event to go to I
think that this is the perfect little
black dress the next item I want to show
you guys is actually a set in his by the
brand reverse and I got it in a size
small this is the top to the set it's
just a little black cropped top and then
it has these tie straps on the side I
love the detailing with the longer ties
on your shoulders like hanging over and
then for bottoms it comes with these
high-waisted black linen shorts and then
it has ruffle detailing at the bottom I
just think that this is so flattering
especially for me I look better in
rubbers and shorts than I do in skirts
and dresses so when I saw this I have to
get it it fits so well again I got it in
a size small I'm obsessed with it I know
I'm gonna be getting a ton of use out of
it this spring this next dress that I'm
about to show you guys I tried it on and
I literally wanted to scream because it
is so cute and so flattering it looks so
good on especially with a tan it is this
white dress and you can't tell the
material just by looking at the camera
it doesn't do any justice but it is just
this white kind of like Swiss dot
material if that makes sense and then it
has a cross in the back and then the
front just has this wrap around material
you guys will see in the Tryon it's so
cute so flattering I absolutely love it
I know it also comes in black and the
brand is just the princess Polly print
and I got it in a size small and then I
picked up a plain white smock crop top
and it is the princess Polly brand got
it in a size 8 and I love the little
ruffle detailing at the top and bottom I
just think that it's so flattering I
love this stretchy material it's kind of
like a smock like band-aid material I
really really like it I don't wear any
bra with it you guys can wear a sticky
bra if you want you totally don't have
to but I think that this is definitely a
staple you guys should have in your
closet just because it goes with
literally everything I wore a shirt like
this when I was in Miami this past week
with a high-waisted skirt and it looked
so good so I have to pick up another one
this one was a little bit longer which I
liked and I know that I am going to be
getting a ton of use out of this and the
next item I'm gonna show you guys I'm so
sad because I should have sized up in it
and they are these shorts right here
these really really distressed denim
shorts and they are by the brands abran
jeans and I love the distressing on the
bottom and the back of them they just
have a little triangle and they're so
high-waisted and I know I got these in a
size 8 I think I'm gonna have to switch
them out for size 10 just because they
are gonna I know they would fit me so
much better and I really
like from a lot so I think that if you
guys are looking for a good pair of high
waisted done with shorts definitely get
these they're so amazing and I wish that
they fit me because I would wear them
every single day if I could
just because they're the perfect pair of
ripped denim shorts they really are and
last but not least I got my first pair
of key sunglasses I've never owned any
pairs of key sunglasses before but I
know that Kylie Jenner RISM all the time
and I've heard a ton about them my
friend Katherine actually wears them too
but got my first pair and they are just
these plain black aviators and they are
so big and oversized which I love I love
oversized sunglasses and I wish that I
had these in Miami because look how cute
these are they're so amazing
I am absolutely obsessed with them and
they are so inexpensive compared to any
other designer sunglasses they're very
very affordable and personally one of my
favorite accessories are sunglasses I
just love big oversized sunglasses I
think that they make any outfit look
super like dressy and I don't know they
just like add a really really nice touch
and if you guys are looking for a really
oversized pair of aviators definitely
get the all black key ones they're so
amazing and they're so lightweight as
well
I know that I'm gonna be wearing these a
ton and they're gonna be at my new
favorites so and that concludes my haul
