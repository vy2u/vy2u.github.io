Maggie's channel today we're gonna be
filming at college QA let's get it hey
guys welcome back to my channel today's
the video we're gonna be I'm it's your
favorite YouTube couple Matt Marlon
Marlon gang everybody yoga challenge
will be up before this so if you guys
saw my last video if you didn't you
should totally check it out I'll have it
linked down below but you will know my
boyfriend Arlen from our yoga challenge
video so in today's video we're gonna be
answering all of your college questions
you guys sent me some dm's we picked out
a few questions that we're gonna answer
so without further ado let's get started
as get it question number one Irie
sophomore but I have many interests
about college what pros and cons do you
find in a state school private versus
state and also are you in a sorority or
fraternity neither of us are in a
sorority or fraternity but I go to a
public school and my boyfriend goes to a
private school
it's really tough guys being in separate
schools yeah one we've just we've made
it work because we're just loved but
going to a private school for me I mean
private school I go to public school
going to a public school I do I just
feel like first of all this girl wrote a
novel props to you yeah how she's been
following me and my sister on insta for
a while mmm han alum shoutout to you
thank you for the big mess wait we did a
whole video on private versus public oh
we did yeah so the answer to that
question will be in the description oh
thank god have you my life you're so
smart next question what is the biggest
mistake you have made in college
Oh your biggest mistake probably coming
in with this girl having a girlfriend in
college I'm just kidding I love her No
umm-hmm biggest mistake I haven't I mean
there's no oh well I did rush a frat and
I feel bad yeah I
and I pledged for like three weeks I
felt really bad because I was playing I
play club hockey and it's really
difficult to balance both a sport and a
fraternity so I ended up having to drop
and it it's just it's kind of sad
because you make such good friends with
people you rust with and all the
brothers and it doesn't work out in the
end like that so it didn't for me so it
was a little sad and sad
my biggest mistake that I made in
college um coming this is personal
coming into freshman year I had a
boyfriend from high school and I like
didn't do as many things as I wished I
did because I was in a relationship like
I didn't go out as much I didn't meet as
many people as I could of that's my
biggest regret that I have not you it
wasn't this boyfriend that I have now it
was another boyfriend but that's my
biggest regret so what I recommend what
I recommend is go into college very
open-minded and just meet as many people
as you can do as many things that you
can experience as many things as you can
because you're only gonna have your
freshman year of college once so live it
up hi
I wasn't able to ask you over snapchat
so I hope you get this I have two
questions numero uno what's your
favorite memory from your freshman year
and numero dos what's your craziest
story from a party PS I love you guys
blah blah blah blah blah okay um what
was the part one favorite memory
freshman year freshman year for me it
was probably Marathon Monday freshman
year I may have talked about this a lot
on my channel but it was just like a
crazy party so many crazy things happen
I have a story time from that day and
it's just like really wild one of my
friends got knocked out like from from
like the huge party to like there was
like a famous person at the party there
like sort of like look oh yeah yeah my
friend got knocked out or you it's just
such a crazy day damn I guess it's like
that answers both for me because it was
the craziest and
whatever that is next question I have a
college question so I'm going to my
freshman year do you guys think boys
just want to hook up or are there some
who want a relationship being serious
there are some who do want relationships
and there are some who are just gonna
want to hook up but don't go into
college looking for the relationship
that's what my biggest piece of advice
would be don't go looking for a
relationship they're definitely gonna
come naturally like if you are meant to
be with a person that you're gonna meet
in college it'll just happen so don't go
searching for someone yeah I was gonna
say the same thing like a lot of my
friends I mean I do have a lot of
friends who are a girlfriend type guys
and a lot of friends who are you know
that hookup type but at the same time it
can happen like that's right yeah next
question what is the biggest lesson
you've learned from college by the way
you're gorgeous thank you Kellie Kramer
biggest let's say me
what's the biggest lesson you've learned
from college honestly not to judge
people like I found that the first
couple weeks of school I learned so much
about so many different types of people
because you're doing all the name games
and like the exercises or whatever you
want to call them you know you're living
with new people and dorm room but as
time goes on you sort of find your
little friend group and like it kind of
gets back to the high school sort of
like like like people hang out with
their the people that they have similar
interests with and that's just the way
it is but I have always sort of stuck
with just like if I see someone who I
wouldn't typically hang out with like
from the very start I just realized like
every everyone has something cool about
them so you just gotta and it's not that
hard to find either yeah just like have
a conversation with someone you wouldn't
think you normally hang out with and
cool things happen I agree and mine kind
of goes
along with that the biggest lesson I've
learned in college is to also not care
about what people think of me because in
high school like I guess it was kind of
like that but once I've got to college
like I stopped caring what anyone
thought of me because if someone thought
something negative about me they're
clearly not supposed to be in your life
and there's a reason for that so just
don't care about what people think of
you live your life the way you want to
live it and you're gonna be so much
happier that way next question what is
the weirdest thing Jack's party joined
ski weirdest thing weirdest thing I saw
a guy get taped to a wall one time that
was pretty wild
I saw I mean people like people get
really drunk and they just like fall I'm
like someone left a hole in our wall
this year someone like ripped off the
door handle yeah you see weird stuff
like that like people like someone
your pants but I don't know at parties
like boys at my school will like take
videos and snapshots of each other and
put them on their story of them like
running into a wall like headfirst and
like hitting their head against walls
and putting these massive holes and it's
like why like why would you do that but
it's and it's like weird it's like
what's the point
but whatever boys are crazy guys I
really want to try SoulCycle I've never
done it before but I think it's finally
time so great we're gonna go with
Gretchen Maggie and if you don't know
Kings no fun it's gonna be crazy yeah so
last question I think that we should
just address this one it's kind of a
basic question about what our major is
because I get a lot of questions about
them my major is marketing and your
major
my major is film film so those are
majors and that completes this little
college QA that we have if you guys are
