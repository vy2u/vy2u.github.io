today's video I have another haul for
you I know you guys are loving my hauls
lately so I just thought that it would
be fun to show you everything that I
just recently got from honey balm and I
know that I have a discount code for you
guys where you can get 20% off of your
full order and it is just Maggie 20 and
again like always I will have all of
these items linked down below in the
item in which I talk about them and I'm
so excited to show all these items to
you guys
I literally try them all on I was like
oh my god I am so excited to wear them
so can I get warmer in Boston now
because I want to start wearing spring
clothes I love all the styles of spring
and I'm so excited to show you guys what
I got so without further ado let's get
started to start off I'm going to show
you guys probably one of my favorite
things that I got actually it's hard to
say that it's one of my favorites
because I literally love everything but
it's just this set and this is what the
top looks like it's a little cropped
shirt and it looks like upside down
because it's supposed to be crisscross
in the front so you kind of have to like
cross the front put this top on and tie
in the back but basically just to show
you the jest you can see in the trial
power when it looks like this is the top
it's just a black and white checkered
gingham top and it's super cute and the
dainty little straps are such a nice
detail and these are the pants right
here and they're just plain black and
white checkered with a zipper up the
back and they are kind of tighter at the
ankle or like straight leg and I got
this in a size medium I probably could
have gone down in to a size small in the
pants but the top definitely fits me
perfectly and I might have to get them
taken in a little bit because they are a
bit loose on the waist but I absolutely
love this set so I'm absolutely obsessed
with this set I love this trend for
spring like different sets and stuff I
think that they look so cute with like
heels and a cute bag and some cute
dainty gold jewelry so I'm super excited
to wear that and the next item I got is
just this red jumpsuit and this is what
it looks like in the front it has a huge
cut out and then just these adjustable
spaghetti straps which I love I got this
in a size medium and I think that the
detailing at the bottom is super cute
just how it's kind of cropped and the
edges flare out a bit which will look so
cute with a pair of new heels and like a
little white bag or some
and some gold jewelry like always but I
just think that this is super cute for
spring so easy to throw on and go to any
type of outdoors event if you want to
wear with sandals like you can wear it
out to lunch you can even dress it up
and wear it out to dinner with some
heels you can pair it with literally
anything I think this is definitely a
great staple to have in your closet and
the next top that I got I'm obsessed
with I am so excited to wear it to
Coachella I know that I'm definitely
gonna be bringing this and it is just
this white lace cami with this kind of
nude colored mesh on the back and I got
this in a size small and it has
adjustable straps on the back which I
really like just because for me at least
like I have smaller boobs so I
definitely need the adjustable straps in
the back and I just think that this is
so cute and literally will go with
anything and it's so like girly but also
gives off like a chic sexy vibe which I
really really really like and this will
look so cute with any different types of
outfits you can wear it with like flared
loose pants you can wear it with that
I'm sure to wear with a pair of jeans
anything and I think that this trend is
so cute right now for spring I've been
seeing tops like this all over the place
and it kind of reminds me of like being
in like Europe and like Paris and just
like having a little coffee in your hand
with like cute sunglasses I don't know I
feel like I see that vibe a lot on
Instagram but I'm so excited that I got
this shirt I cannot wait to wear it any
next item I picked up is just another
gingham set and this one has this
off-the-shoulder
tight top and it is blue and white
checkered print again I didn't like
gingham until this year like it has
always been kind of a trend lately but I
feel like I always like didn't like it I
don't know what it was about it but it
came with these matching pants and they
are super high waisted and loose and
just a very lightweight material and
they also were kind of cropped and flare
out at the end and then they kind of
have in this paper bag waist like
detailing on it with a little tie that
just ties in the back and this is super
like a Little House on the Prairie vibes
don't quote me on that I've never even
seen that movie but that's just like the
vibe that gives me but I think that this
is so cute to wear like out to a Sunday
brunch so I'm definitely gonna be
wearing this like out to brunch or
something like when I'm back on the Cape
and just like super chill vibe
maybe throw on like some slip on sandals
and just like cute sunglasses my hair in
a bun I'm so excited to wear this I just
think that it's so simple and you can
make such a cute outfit out of two
pieces that are gonna be completely like
comfortable but also make you look a lot
more dressed up which you guys know is
my vibe like I love wearing comfy
clothes but I need to start like putting
away the joggers for this season because
it's getting a little too excessive like
I need to start looking cute and like
kind of making myself look a little bit
more presentable so this is definitely
so perfect because I can be comfy but
also still look really cute and before I
forget I got this little gingham set in
a size medium and the next item that I
got I'm so obsessed with like these are
actually probably the cutest pair of
pants I've ever put on my body in my
whole entire existence of living and
they're these white very very very high
waisted sheer pants and they flow out at
the bottom they are like Greek goddess
they're so cute I got them in a size
medium you'll see in the Tryon part
they're adorable and I'm gonna be
wearing these to Coachella I think I'm
gonna wear them with this little white
bra laptop right here just because it
gives that like chill like goddess II
glowy vibe and I love it and they're so
comfortable and they're so high waisted
so they really suck you in and make you
look so good they're super flattering I
am obsessed and I know I'm gonna be
wearing these a ton I just love wearing
like pants and shorts that are really
high waisted and that fit well and I got
these in a size medium and they just
have a little zipper up the side they're
super flattering super comfortable and I
really really really I'm so excited to
wear them and so the next item I got is
another pair of loose pants and they're
just these black and white striped ones
and I got them in a size medium but I
definitely could have gone down and got
them in a size small so they are just
very very very loose and they're kind of
too big like on my leg area but they fit
me well on the waist because they do
have a little tie so you can adjust them
to any size that you want but again
they're just a super comfortable pair of
high waisted pants that just are so
flattering suck everything in you can
wear with a plain little tank top a
bodysuit whatever you want add a little
jean jacket you can wear a much dinner
to lunch you can really style them
however you want so I think definitely
having a pair of pants like this is a
good staple to have for spring and then
I all
have to pick up a plane staple when I do
a type of haul like this so this one is
just a little black bodysuit and it is
really low on the sides and just kind of
shows a little bit of side boob which i
think is super cute just because they
don't have anything like this and to
wear this with like denim shorts or even
those striped pants that I just showed
you I think it just adds a little
something extra chair outfit you can
even wear like a long necklace that
drapes all the way down since it does
have the little side loop showing but
this one is just a black little bodysuit
I picked this up in a size medium and
then I got this little pink silk dress
and this is a size medium as well and it
just has this button detailing all down
the front and it is is kind of like a
silky material which i think is really
nice because it's super loose and like
not heavy for spring and you can
definitely throw it on and wear it with
a pair of heels and some gold jewelry to
any event or wear it during the day with
sandals and a jean jacket and it doesn't
have adjustable straps so that's why I
got a size medium because I know that if
I got a size small I feel like it would
have been too short on me but this one
is the absolute perfect length and I
think that this color is gorgeous right
now I love this like light baby pink I
have it on my nails right now as you
guys can see and I don't work color so I
thought that this little baby pink dress
was a nice addition to my closet and
last but not least before I forget I
honestly was about to end this video
until I realized that I'm wearing one of
the shirts that I got so it's just this
white shirt with these eyelet sleeves
and I'll show you right now but you can
probably see in the charm portion it is
like a little bra let on the top and it
just goes all the way around it has
these cute little sleeves and they are
eyelet and house like this little ruffle
at the edge I am obsessed with the shirt
it's fit so well I got it in a size
medium as well and you can literally
wear with anything you wear it with
jeans high-waisted shorts and I probably
wouldn't wear it with the pair of pants
that I tried it on with for this haul
you guys would have seen in the trial
part I wore it with a pair of like green
paper bag like high waisted pants from
honey bum but it like didn't really look
that good but I mean if you want to wear
that and you like the look of that then
you totally can but for me at least I
probably would wear this type of shirt
with something denim so that concludes
my haul video for today I hope you
