and then I'm not gonna lie it really a
little bit late getting in the car we
were supposed to at five o'clock and
like my dad was ready definitely before
five like he's always ready so early and
so am I
and we got downstairs I like 515 520
else we end up leaving so we finally
have the everyone we made our flight
like last minute here Chucky oh we're
all checked in and you paid for our bags
everything we were drifting like our bag
tag to like attached to our C pace and
right as we were like doing it up a
kiosk it like timed out and they're like
no you're too late like
so we're at dinner now when we got a few
appetizers this one is a barbecue
chicken flatbread and then this one
right here is just hung us in pita bread
and stuff and this is what Emma and I
got for dinner just a little salad with
shrimp and mango avocado strawberries of
tomatoes or Maine
Emma's not really feeling well right now
she like has really got allergies but
looks so yummy so we're just leaving
dinner right now and we're like walking
outside and what time is it it 31 during
eat dinner at like the lobby like
restaurant sushi bar thing in our hotel
they were saying yeah and I'm not gonna
say what hotel we're staying out right
now just because I feel like I shouldn't
say that until you feel like to say a
few reasons not like anyone's gonna like
hop on a plane to come to a robot but
anyway so we are walking now to
connection can you guys know Emma and I
like a new dessert after me dinner but
we just like more really casual outfits
and it was like really comfy and stuff
and they need to like wash my hair
because I have like stuff from today we
were gonna look open or to see I'm like
way too tired now I feel like since I
got three hours of sleep I just need to
like go back I think it was the brush
that looks so good at my I don't know
she should get the same thing as you or
get something
different that looks really good I think
we have the same thing in the air
yeah and could I have the same thing as
her please yes
oh my god those are huge
good morning guys so we just woke up
it's our first official day in Aruba we
got here yesterday around 12:30 ish but
we didn't end up vlogging any of our day
so I'm just gonna show you guys from now
on what we're doing during the day just
because so many people have been
requesting that and of course like if
I'm on vacation I'm gonna show you guys
what I'm doing what I'm eating where I'm
going
stuff like that just in case if you guys
go to Aruba any time soon you guys want
to go to any of these places you totally
can but anyway so Emma and I just woke
up it's around 9 o'clock right now we're
gonna get ready and go get some coffee
and head down it to the beach
I don't think I showed you guys but this
is what our room looks like actually
it's like wicked messy with all of them
a nice stuff so we have like a desk area
where we're uploading editing stuff like
that and then this is Emma nice bed
right here and then we have another bed
for our dad then it just goes back to
the hallway and there's a little
bathroom but Emma's vlogging outside I
think that this is the best of it all
the future
and this is the view from our room
that's a pool and then the beach on
there so as you can see there look great
on the water Emma doesn't feel good
something really nice about our hotel
we have Starbucks and great downstairs
wait I wonder if I can order on the
mobile app and they can make it and have
it ready instead of waiting in this long
line as you guys can probably already
tell the mobile app didn't work it
didn't come up like our phone that there
was a Starbucks here so no we have to go
wait in line for coffee but I love the
coffee here was so good I call in
yesterday
this coffee is so good right now it
tastes like friends from Miami comment
down below if you guys remember every
single morning when Kenny and I would go
get iced coffees from friends breakfast
with of you just kidding this but oh my
gosh wow it's so bright it's so pretty
right eating breakfast right along the
beach and this is just what I'm having
today I'm I got a little omelet spinach
and tomato I got some grapes and
grapefruit this is my favorite part
about this place that they have cut up
grapefruit for breakfast and I'm I just
got the same thing but instead she got
scrambled eggs and I got an omelet cos I
wanted a cheese
I said I wanted great okay whatever I'm
over it I'm over it and my favorite part
is this group
obviously but um look at the water it's
so pretty it's clear crystal clear
and the sand is so soft but look at that
it's so gorgeous like never been
anywhere where the waters like this well
it's kind of like this in Miami but this
is like extra clear it's so blue
oh my bathing suit is from Asaf oh I'll
have all the bathing suits that I wear
on this trip in like a king Hall video
for every buff Emma and I got salads for
lunch
Hyrum this is like the perfect spot my
eyes are actually burning right now but
these are so good what the heck is this
about that's my dad's but it's just a
salad with some shrimp on it and I'm so
excited to eat up actually we're very
hungry we're going to work out elevators
so cool you can like see ahead of us but
we're gonna work out right now just
because this morning we didn't get to
put out because we slept it for too long
and we are planning on going and looking
at like really early I'm like a clock
but we were so tired from traveling that
we didn't do it so now we're gonna head
over now it's our own like 4:30 evening
but I think we're the only ones in the
gym right now look at how cool it is
it's two floors oh my god wait did I not
bring my big water
I think I forgot it I'm gonna have to
get a cup of water I didn't bring it
with me in whatever but oh my god we're
the only ones here right now
this is quoi
see there and I'll show you guys what
I'm wearing for my workout today you
can't really see because the Lighting's
bad since the natural lights coming in
from that way
but I'm just wearing my Lululemon sports
start with these Nike Pro spandex and
then I have my little which you backpack
on right now just because I needed to
bring a few things down with me to the
gym I'm gonna put on my EPL's right now
and you guys were like Maggie did you
like running in your APL's the other day
like for my last hug and I actually did
like it so I highly recommend don't have
them linked up below for you guys look
at this view this is the view that we
got from here
I'm excited to work out because I didn't
get to work out Wednesday for today yeah
I think it to work out yesterday or
Monday and then over the weekend I have
like all the Tyler's eduation stuff so I
just want to like spend time with him
and I'd work out and you can't so I went
running on Friday
didn't work out till Tuesday no Thursday
I am excited to work out and I really
want to get back into routine like to
start running more now that it's summer
and I can run outside on the Cape yeah
it's gonna be kind of hard when I go to
Italy I think I'm gonna bring my shoes
and run outside and like do little
workouts like bodyweight workouts in our
hotel room just because I don't know I
said you can't go 17 days without
working out and that's how long we're
gonna be Europe for so like when we're
not traveling obviously I'm not gonna
work out seven days a week but
definitely a PV we go over there just to
feel better I just got done working no
and it was such a good workout now I'm
just gonna like stretch and stuff around
this room about workout but I did 20
minutes on the treadmill and I ran for
the first ten minutes um speed like 6.0
to 6.5 on an incline of 1 and then once
I've hit 10 minutes every 30 seconds I
would sprint on and off like 30 seconds
on 30 seconds off I guess fast as I
could and so I did that and then 20
minutes total than a four to five minute
cooldown
I'm literally jumping I'm so hot and I'm
gonna do this every day well I'm here
just because I think it's really
efficient workout and it doesn't take
that much time and it's like really good
for fat loss and just like toning up
your body and getting in shape at least
for me like it's not for everybody
cardio definitely isn't for everybody
but for me I feel like it really helps
like with my body and the reason why I'm
filming in the mirror is because the
lighting was really bad when I tried to
just film my face from like the back of
me dinner that's the same place we went
to last night and what is it called a
bar or something
it didn't love you of our hotel but it's
just tonight and as you guys can see in
the back like this is where the guy
makes the sushi right there and then
this whole sides just a big huge circle
bar but it's really cool and then
there's like lounge chairs over there
and that's the Starbucks that we go to
in the morning just to give you guys a
reference is where we are but it's so
cool because obviously he makes all the
sushi right in front of us and yeah so
it's gonna be super yummy
we're starting with the miso soup both
of us not one this one looks really good
it looks different than the ones at home
I think that there's more scallions in
it and it looks like darker
it's like the roof aversion and what I
love what leads oh yeah yeah those
leaves out the Thai food restaurant but
it's gonna be so good and then I just
got the best sushi ever
well the best-looking sushi I ever
really tried yet but we got spicy tuna
just a regular spicy tuna roll and then
tuna sushi keep and comment down below
why your favorite sushi is if you like
it and if you like to put ginger on top
and wasabi because M&amp;amp;I love a ginger and
wasabi we're at this store that's
attached to our hotel like at a
different hotel and they have these
Dairy Milk Cadbury like candy bars and
they remind me of Sammy Robinson like if
you guys watch our vlogs you know that
she loves chocolate she's always like
I'm laying in bed and I'm eating the
chocolate and she always talks about
she's like I'm obsessed with chocolate
and she always eats this kind it's so
funny let me see
you look fine um it just doesn't like
when the Sun I'm the like wind is
blowing on her hair but anyway look how
cute these are these little mini
haagen-dazs ice creams
we're thinking about doing a video about
American like since Emma and I obviously
American like trying different like
foods and snacks that we don't have in
America have you like those down there
they're called Tosh and they're cookies
so I just bought this a little I don't
know if you can edit you know it's a
kick capita has a different packaging
than American kick-out
so I'm curious to see if it tastes
different because it said on the
packaging I think different writing it's
less even it said something about like
extra milk and cocoa so I'm gonna try it
in everywhere I did whoa it already
tastes different I'm it reminded me of
Thailand because kick outs are his
favorite candy and if they do taste
different and they're really good I'm
probably gonna get em one and bring it
back to let me eat my other piece holy
Wow
hmm
it's like more
rich
it's very rich probably go to bed
Wow
that's crazy oh so we're finally back in
the room I'm trying to send a snapshot
just because we don't have service
everywhere we go
Oh on the island so my stuff like kicks
in it takes like a second for everything
kickin but I'm gonna go to bed now with
Emma it's 8:45 and we're so tired so
we're gonna go to bed
buddies for the end of the vlog here I
don't even know like what I've logged
cuz it's about like the longest two days
I'm just tired so I'm gonna edit this
vlog right now and then probably go to
bed and then wake up in the morning
