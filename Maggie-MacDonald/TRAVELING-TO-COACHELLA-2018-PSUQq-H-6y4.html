I can't remember the last time I've
logged I know this is probably gonna be
like a big mashup of a bunch of like
different days I think but I just filmed
it was that face I just made oh I just
filmed the big video hall first spring
Tryon I'm putting this like on a little
glass container and because I need to
put my new clothes back on but I just
filmed a huge haul all the stuff that I
got is so freaking cute but it's like 45
degrees out today so I can't wait till
it's warmer out and I can like wear some
of the stuff that I got literally
yesterday all I did was sit at Tyler's
house and we just like had such a chill
like relaxing day in Him and I just like
talked and like I was having like really
really bad anxiety yesterday just cuz
I've had so much going on in my life
I've been traveling so much I'm a
full-time student I'm trying to upload
videos every single day for you guys
like I just have so much I want to do
right now so much on my mind
I've so many videos that I want to film
and like I'm have been traveling I think
I just had that but I don't know it just
like all got to me yesterday and I was
like oh my god like I just needed to
take like a day to just breathe and like
relax and realize that like I need to
just take it step by step and like day
by day I can't just try to cram
everything you do it all at once so yeah
but so yesterday and that's what I did I
had like a big long a chill day now I'm
feeling a lot better today I just did a
haul and I got so much stuff in the mail
and like don't think I'm gonna open it
up yet just because I want to wait to do
a haul video for you guys actually maybe
I'll open it now and then show you in my
holiday when I do it so I got some stuff
from forever21 a lot of this stuff I
think is from
I got for Coachella and I can't like
remember when I ordered because I
literally got so many packages but this
one has oh I got jewelry in this little
box bag I got two necklaces this one is
like a coin necklace with just like a
long like gold part of the bottom so
it's like layered which I might wear to
Coachella I don't know yet and then this
is another one of those necklaces like
the one that I was just talking about
but this one has like a little my
diamonds and then this longer gold thing
at the bottom with a chain which i think
is super cute I actually haven't owned
anything like this before I've been
getting all of my cool necklaces and
stuff that I've been wearing in my
videos from forever 21 I don't know if I
mentioned that before but a lot of my
necklaces are from forever 21 and I
don't know why I'm opening this right
now because I don't know what I'm gonna
do with it I have to like come up with
an idea I have like a little jewelry
holder thing up there and it's like
starting to get really full I don't know
if I'm like trying to try this on right
now no I need to put this down and then
I got this really really cute um lace
duster oh my god it's even cuter in
person I got in size small I was $30 but
it's just sheer white lace and just goes
down and like has little slits and stuff
and it's short-sleeved and has a little
tie in the front but I'm gonna wear this
to Coachella probably so I got that from
forever 21 I'm super excited and then I
have an Urban Outfitters package
oh I forgot these I need to like try out
my outfits for Coachella because I have
no idea what I'm gonna wear
okay these look really ugly probably
like in the camera but there are these
really high waisted um like seamless
bottoms that I'm gonna wear under a
completely sheer black dress from ASOS
I'm gonna do a lookbook with like
Coachella outfit cuz I don't know if I'm
gonna wear everything that I bring you
know or everything that I got so maybe
I'll do like a inspired outfit look what
thingy and then in this little bag I
feel like the Train always goes by when
I'm filming but in this one I bought a
bralette and this bralette just looks oh
the back is cute I didn't know that it
had like a little elastic that's kind of
different I like that oh we're going to
alter I forgot about that okay this is
really cute it's like a little black
halter bralette
I'm excited to wear that and then the
last package is just from Free People
and it's called the move along bodysuit
and it's just a seamless little white
bodysuit has adjustable straps which I
really like so I know I'm gonna be
writing this a lot I've been like in the
process of like organizing or at least
trying to organize my room I just have
like so many clothes and stuff and also
so much like trash I am like doing
spring cleaning or something today like
this is literally all trash uh so yeah
that's like my life right now I'm just
like trying to slowly like get my life
together just cuz I feel like I've been
like super busy lately and stuff oh and
this lip if you guys wanting it's from
NYX I'm gonna do a video about like the
necks lips and my favorite ones and
showing you guys like maybe a swatch
thing where I have like minimal just
plain makeup on and then just like
showing you guys bunch of different lips
because I saw that say my Robinson did
one so I think been doing that for
guys but now I think I'm gonna go
through my closet and try to like get
rid of some things that I don't wear
anymore
just because I like have a problem where
I look through my closet and be like oh
this shirt that I got like months ago
from Urban Outfitters that is really
cute and it looked really cute at one
time oh I'm definitely gonna wear it
soon unlike no guys so sorry I'm like
super gross right now I literally just
got back from the gym I'm like sweaty
and hot and it's like 1:30 I'm packing
for Coachella and I just thought that I
would you like a little pack with me
vlogger I know you guys have been liking
those like when I did them for Miami a
couple times just to like show you guys
when I'm packing like what's in my
carry-on my suitcase how I organize them
all of that so I'm going to be doing
that now it's 1:30 like I said I still
have to get my nails down I have to get
my eyebrows down meet Gretchen at her
dorm at 5:45 like I have so much stuff
to do before I go I don't even know if
I'm gonna make it to SoulCycle so at the
moment I'm just packing all of my stuff
this is literally what I have my bag a
few bathing suits one outfit and yeah I
like took pictures in my clothes the
other day and just so I could remember
like what I wanted to pack but now that
I'm like trying to get everything
together I don't know why it's like
taking me forever but yeah so I'm gonna
wear this body suit right here this Free
People bodysuit with this I'm not gonna
show you guys my outfits too much just
because I don't know I don't want you
guys to see like what I'm wearing before
the actual day but yeah so I'm gonna be
using my same packing cubes as I've
always used when traveling these ones
that I just got from Free People I got
them on Jo and they're just the Cal pack
brand so I'm gonna use the big one this
medium sized one and then this small one
right here to fit into my little
suitcase right here I think I'm going to
use this backpack as my carry-on it's
just this backpack by her show I don't
even know how to
don't sit but that's it right there and
honestly I might have to use my Lou
Vuitton duffel bag also depending on how
I got everything organized so I'm gonna
start to put all my clothes together
right now and then put them into my
packing cubes but I'll show you guys
like when I organize them and stuff like
start doing that just because I know you
guys really wanted like tips on how to
stay organized when traveling okay
update on packing I finally got
somewhere with it so all of these are my
sweatpants right here I have one more
pair that's in the dryer that I'm gonna
put right here and then I'm gonna put
all the way sleeping t-shirts on top of
this one right here so this little
whatever this thing is called packing
cube is gonna be like my comfy sleep
airplane flight clothes
wow they couldn't speak I'm like so
stressed out I don't know if you can
tell but and then this packing cube
right here is gonna have all of my
potential festival outfits and then just
other outfits for other random things
that we're doing and it's nice because
like once you zip them up and like Pat
it all down then all the clothes are
gonna flatten and they're gonna fit
really nicely into the cubes so and then
I'll put this cube and this cube into my
little suitcase and then I also have
shorts two pairs at a time shorts that
I'm gonna fit in this one or maybe even
put it in this one right here and then I
have some accessories I have all of my
necklaces and earrings in these little
dust bags and then I have this belt
right here that I'm bringing and I have
all my underwear and bathing suits in
this one and then I think that's pretty
much it and I'm only bringing these two
pairs of shoes I'm gonna bring these
really cool platform sneakers that I got
from Puma and then just these plain
heels for dinner tomorrow night and then
I'm gonna be wearing my slides on the
plane I need to put makeup in here and
then I'm bringing self-tanner because I
want to put some self-tanner on before
obviously I go outside cuz I'm losing my
tan for Miami and I have my care of
vitamins that are gonna go in my little
toiletries case and this is from
Lululemon I don't know if they still
have it but you can usually get them
online like the little Lululemon
toilet treat cases and then I have my
tripod for my camera and then on my desk
right here I just have a little thing of
like airplane essentials my lip mask
some eyelash brushes down there some
facial spray some chapstick and then I
also have my perfume phone charger air
pods sunglasses I think that is pretty
much it I need to pack my hairbrush and
then I'm also going to go to the store
right now just pick up some last-minute
little toiletries so basically this is
everything that I have packed so I'm
gonna finish up packing all this stuff
and get it into my little suitcase and
hopefully I get all that done and I am
able to get my nails done okay so makeup
and all my other stuff is now packed and
I'm wearing my SoulCycle outfit I'm
gonna try to attempt to look at my nails
in right now I don't know how that's
gonna work and I wouldn't try just
because like I know that my gels been on
for so long it's gonna start peeling
soon and like while I'm at Coachella the
last thing I want to do is like peel off
all my gel and have my nails look really
disgusting so I'm gonna go try to get a
manicure and see how that works cuz I
have this color in mine that I really
want to guess so
I need to get a little jacket I'm just
gonna throw on this little green bomber
jacket from honeyBun I think yeah I
think I got it from home even like a
while ago but this is what I'm gonna
wear
wow I go attempt to get a manicure I
ended up putting on Emma's little brainy
melville sweatshirt sorry I'm if you're
watching this I am obsessed with this
torture but I really need to hurry
and another thing that I almost forgot
was my camera charger so it would have
been really bad I also wanted to try to
get my eyelashes done like once more
before this just to like touch them on
but that didn't happen either so safe to
say that I am the least prepared person
for this trip ever so I just went to in
the nail salon and I went to two
different ones and honestly they were
all like crazy busy so I was like you
know what that's my fault I should have
got my handles on earlier I can deal
with these nails and Gretchen was like
yeah my nails are like so bad too so
we're both gonna have to embrace it and
yeah cuz I really want to go to
SoulCycle just because I know that like
I've been super stressed out today that
like I know it'll make me feel better
and plus we're going to Maddie's class
so it's gonna be super fun but I just
went to CVS and I bought some stuff at
the drugstore so I got this little thing
that I'm gonna put my witch hazel into
and then I got a shampoo and conditioner
just because it's like a little travel
size and this one is just by Apothecary
essentials and then it's for fine and
flat hair which is literally my hair and
I got some tylenol just in case if I get
a headache and I got this for my lotion
I'm gonna put my lotion into there
and then I also got a little toothpaste
and some baby wipes just because I like
to always have these on me to like clean
my hands off and stuff like that
- camera hat so you do like a cool girl
