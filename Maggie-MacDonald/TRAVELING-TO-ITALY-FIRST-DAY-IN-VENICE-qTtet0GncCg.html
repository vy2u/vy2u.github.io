smoothie iced coffee
let's get it
what Gretchen and I do to get a good
Instagram picture there used to be a wet
floor sign right in the middle of the
ground and we literally just moved it
all the way down there
how many wet floor signs do you have to
move for good
just playing and now we're in Toronto
didn't even this was speaking I know
that was fake names but look at us
waiting with all these other people
because our flight to Venice is delayed
by a really long time so
I don't know what to do other than like
sit here or at least you made it
and also our landing was really bad oh I
can't even look at myself taking
somebody snapped out to me but our
landing was really about it literally
the plane was going like this and then
just rose music on the ground and I was
like I never want to fly we're ordering
food this is so cool you like it sit
and these tables that have iPads and
order the food and I bring it to you
from over there so that is exactly what
I did and I'm trying to check out right
now when the order keys
but this is what I bought over some wine
and Greek salad with chicken
this is not the funniest thing ever I
come back in all of these are next to
Gretchen and I
but I just want to show you guys I did a
little haul because we obviously just
ordered dinner which you guys must eat
in a second and then look what I got a
big bag of snacks and this is how you
stay healthy while traveling got it I
got one for you and one for me and
they're bootable Himalayan pink salt
organic popcorn and these are perfect
because they're just light something
easy to snack on the flame I also got a
banana just in case I'm hungry just
because those are healthy really really
good for you then I also got and then I
also got a thing of mixed nuts and this
one is only 115 calories which I like
don't count calories and calories don't
really like matter to me but nuts are
very very high in calories so sometimes
like when you eat a bag of nuts like it
can be up to like 500 calories which is
just like more than a serving that your
body can handle so this one's perfect
just because it's like one serving and
it's a bunch of different nuts and like
dried cranberries and walnuts almonds
and that stuff you guys could totally
make this at home what else did I get
I got a water a big smart water you guys
know I love smart water and then I also
got this kind bar and what I like about
these ones this is the almond sea salt
and dark chocolate one this kind bar
only has where is it I don't know if my
camera will focus but it only has five
grams of sugar which is good because
some of the kind bars have like 20 grams
of sugar and they're really bad for you
like all that out and sugar just is so
unnecessary so that is my little haul
yeah okay this is why it was scared to
get the Greek salad because what is this
that's the jitney mommy chicken you know
came from what does what I'm excited for
the wines I just took a cute little
boomerang for my Instagram story there's
chicken body
it probably is this one's just really
weird but whatever at least we're eating
greens you feel me my god I've never
been so happy to be off that plane it's
so bright oh my god I'm so excited
Wow
so whatever seen before is he just
playing
the world every diamond cutter project
on the spot
we're trying to find it
I was so sad like we weighed in like
we're awesome
because you want to look for my Airbus
and finally the like oh where you doing
like genie huh forever cuz we were like
still on it they're like yeah
and one girl was just a fluke around
yes the whitening right over there
anyway I found the everybody I'm really
happy but it's so hot here think I'm
still wearing my sweatshirt and slap
hands at all of those everywhere since
yesterday so
we finally made it to Venice and we
showered and everything so now we feel
so much better look how pretty it is
we're finally getting time to like walk
around by ourselves right now and
everything is so cool it's been so
pretty it's like how I expected it to
look like my pictures and stuff like
everything looks so I don't know how to
describe it and more in Venice right now
I've been like saying that obviously and
then we have two other cities that we
are going to that you guys will also see
in the vlogs but it's just so nice out
and right now it's like almost five
o'clock and so we are meeting back up
with our group at 6:00 to go back for
like this party that you guys will see
but we have a little bit of time to like
walk around alone which I really like
Gretchen and I just took a bunch of
photos along this little canal area
which I know tomorrow we'll be doing
more stuff and we're gonna be in the
city for longer but today we just got
free time which was really nice so we
kind of just got to like walk off on our
own and like Choa and see everything but
one of my favorite parts about it is
that everything is like white and pink
and like each colored and I don't know I
just think it's so pretty
it's like pastel like this buildings
Orange and the next one's like peach and
like blush color I don't know I really
like it and it's right on the water so
there's a bunch of like fresh seafood
and stuff I can like smell the salt
water
Jenna and I just got back from our long
day and look we got a brand new room and
it feels so good because last time we
were sharing with there were literally
like it was smaller than this and there
were six bunk beds in it and it was
Gretchen I and a bunch other girls
oh well six beds three bunk beds and so
it was us I think a bunch of different
other girls and which was totally fine
like if we didn't have to film and like
do YouTube and stuff we just felt like
we were gonna be like disturbing the
register no we literally were these
girls were probably like oh my god and
so when we talked it like the leader our
um I almost call them our orientation
leader what is our tour guide Tyson he's
super nice and we're like Tyson we
thought we signed up for like the
two-bedroom like we hate to like ask
about this like whatever and he was like
no no no like you guys have two bedroom
or like two people to a bedroom which is
obviously Gretchen and I in Roman and
Florence and then also now finally in
Venice we do because the driver actually
lives locally so they were like oh the
driver like doesn't need a room anymore
so we were like thank God so now we have
our big room and then it also has a
bathroom which has like the toilet and
not weird little thing right there and
the shower and then wait is this a ring
light good like it's perfect lighting
it's like a giant ring light so now we
have this big room in a big bed so now
we can snuggle together and I'm gonna
unpack all my stuff like I just did
before just underneath here I like
taking it out of my suitcase and just
like plopping it in um but now I'm gonna
unpack all of my stuff just put my
packing cubes in this little bin right
there let me see if Gretchen
yeah Gretchen has it on the other side
which is really good and then I'll
probably explore my suitcase somewhere
over in the corner so I just took a body
shower we're finally done like with our
whole entire day and it's 904 p.m. we
landed on 11 o'clock today so it's been
like a really busy day we've just been
like trying to see some of the city like
eating meeting everybody stuff like that
like the vlogs that are coming will be
more like interesting and stuff but this
one was just like traveling and an
introduction to Venice and the trip but
make sure you're subscribed if you are
new and if you're not already because
I'm going to be posting so many videos
this trip and also I asked you guys on
my instrument to me to do like a
specific are like one video for every
single city we go to like all do like a
Venice vlog or growing vlog and a
Florence vlog and I didn't know like if
you guys liked that idea or like what
the deal was so leave a comment down
below and like let me know your thoughts
or if I should just do a daily vlog so
yeah we have to get up super early in
the morning and honestly right now it's
like three o'clock at home if it's 9:00

exhausted so I feel like I'm already
