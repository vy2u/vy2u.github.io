today's video I'm going to be doing a
huge bikini haul you guys have been
waiting for this video for so long and
I'm so excited to finally sit down and
show you guys all of the bikinis that I
got I got all these bathing suits for my
trip to Aruba that I went on a few weeks
ago if you guys are following me on
instagram you would have seen all of my
pictures from my trip I was wearing all
Saahil bikinis while I was there and you
guys have been dying to see which ones
that I got and how they fit and just
here at my reviews about them so I'm
super excited to share that with you
guys today and if you don't know ones
Apple is it is an online boutique that
has a bunch of cute trendy affordable
clothes they literally have everything
that you could ever like imagine on
their website and it is very good
quality a lot of people I know are
questionable about saffle and they don't
know like if the quality is great and
all that but I have tried all these
bikinis and personally zhamuhe bikinis
are my favorite why don't you find a
style that you like and you feel like
fits well with your body type
then you will literally find amazing
bikinis on their site I used to buy
really expensive brands like Billabong
and like all those surfer bikini brands
because we have a lot of like local
shops on Cape Cod where I live that sell
those brands but just for me I feel like
they never fit my body the right way so
once I found out like what type of
bathing suits I liked ons Apple I
ordered literally all of them and they
all fit so well and I'm so obsessed with
them so I can not wait to share them
with you guys and also zepho has $30 if
you spent over $30 you get free shipping
on your order which i think is such a
great deal and I will have all of these
bathing suits linked it down below for
you guys if you want to check them out
and get them and yeah if you're new here
make sure you hit that subscribe button
I'm gonna be making videos all summer
and also comment down below any video
date ideas that you guys would like to
see I would be a totally up to doing
anything you guys want I want to create
content that you guys want to see so
yeah without further ado let's get
started
okay so the first bathing suit I am
going to show you guys is this white one
right here and this is what the top
looks like it kind of looks like a
little brawl at sports bra and the
material is just this ribbed material
and then the bottoms are very cheeky all
the bathing suits I'm going to be
showing you guys today are cheeky and I
do know that ons FL if you do like any
of these styles they come in like a more
full coverage of version as well and
just for my body take the reason why I
wear such cheeky bikinis is because the
full but like more coverage ones don't
fit me that well they like actually
don't fit me at all and I can never find
any that look good on me or that I like
and that I feel good in so that is why I
choose to wear the cheeky ones so the
bottoms just look exactly the same this
bathing suit is amazing it's so
comfortable I know I wore it one of the
days in a room I'll have all of the
photos inserted right here just to show
you guys like what the bathing suits
look like on but yeah this one is very
very cute I got it in a size medium a
lot of the bathing suits I will be
showing you today I did get in a size
medium unless I got it in size small but
I like guys know just because I feel
like it fits me better and sometimes
they run really small and the next
bathing suit is this ribbed one as well
it's the same material as the one that I
just showed you guys but this top is a
lot different and it has these thicker
straps it's more of a sports bra type
bikini this one's more conservative on
the top I really like the way that this
one looks and I also think that the
detailing on it adds a great touch the
next bathing suit is actually one of my
favorites I was posting so many photos
in this bikini and I think the color is
absolutely amazing and it's just this
baby blue top like this and it has this
tie like lace-up detailing in the front
which i think is super cute and then the
bottoms are just plain and cheeky and
they look like that and this next
bathing suit was one of my favorites
when I went to Miami with Gretchen Emma
and Lucy and Gretchen had it in black so
I got it in white these are the bottoms
it's just this white kind of polka dot
print and then they have ties
side and then the top just looks like
this it has little spaghetti straps and
then it has this detailing what kind of
Criss crosses I think this one fits very
very well it's really flattering on your
body I think the tides on the side add a
really nice touch and also how it like
Criss crosses in the front it's just
super flattering on you and very
feminine the next thing you see is one
of my all-time favorites I own it and
why you guys probably know from my
Instagram I wear the white version when
I was in California but this one is just
the black version this is what the top
looks like it just ties there in the
front and then across the back it's just
straight across and then the bottoms are
super cute these are really different
than all the other bottoms that I have
from zoppo they're just plain black in
the front and then on the back they have
this ruched detailing which i think is
really cute and it's really flattering
on as well in the next bathing suit I
wore on the catamaran when we were in
Aruba and I got so many compliments on
the same thing soo I think the color is
amazing and these are what the bottoms
look like they're just royal blue cheeky
bottoms in the top is super flattering
as well because it looks like this and
it kind of looks like a sports probably
like deeps dips deeps it dips lower in
the front so you can kind of like get
more of a tan on your chest which I
personally like but this bathing suit
was very like sporty but also cute and
it was perfect
for when we went snorkeling on the
catamaran so if you're looking for a
bathing suit like to do water activities
in but you also want to look at the cute
at the same time I highly recommended
this blue one and the next bikini I got
this one is also one of my favorites as
well I got it in two different colors so
I got it in this white color it is just
plain and has this little clasp strap in
the back and it has adjustable straps
which I love and then the bottoms are
just these plain white bottoms this is
how they go and as you can see the
detailing on them is just kind of ribbed
when I got the bathing suit in black
because I was so obsessed with it so I
was like you know what I need to get it
in two different colors so I have black
and I also have white and the bottoms
are the same as the ones I just showed
you before they're just super cheeky
Blakk ribbed
bottoms and this is different than like
a string bikini because it has the clasp
in the back and the bottoms are
like more thicker than string bikini
bottom's without like the ties sometimes
those don't really fit me that well so
these ones are absolutely perfect this
binge is super flattering and I got it I
got it in a size medium and the top
looks really small when you hold it up
and see it in person but once you try it
on you guys will see in the photo that I
will insert that it fits super well and
also like the top isn't as small as you
would think it is when you look at it
and this next bathing suit you guys were
like dying over in my Instagram because
of the top this is what it looks like it
is just triangle and then it has this
like extra band on the bottom that just
like goes lower on your ribcage but I
don't think that I posted a photo of the
back of it you guys are going to freak
out look how cute this is it's just this
lace-up detailing and it ties on the
bottom I think that that's super cute
and the bottoms are very very cute as
well because they are just these cheeky
ones but I really like the detailing on
the side how it has this little silver
clasp it just adds something extra to
the bathing suit instead of just being
plain white and the detailing on it is
also just ribbed
so it's not planar or anything it adds
like a really nice touch and I think
this bathing suit is so flattering I
actually got this one in a size small
just because I would think that like
this part on the back has how you can
adjust it and tie it tighter I ended up
going down in size just because I didn't
want it to be too big on the top and
next you guys have been messaging me
about this bathing suit on Instagram a
ton lately and it is just this snakeskin
one and the top is like a bandeau top
but you can't take off the straps which
I like just because I don't really like
strapless bikinis I just feel like
they're such a hassle to always just
keep pulling up and I don't know I just
really like how this one has the straps
on it and it is a snakeskin print and
then it just clasps in the back and the
bottoms are thicker but they are cheeky
so this is what they look like I wore
this one on the first day of every but I
got so many compliments I really just
liked how flattering the top isn't I
really love the bottoms and also the
print being snakeskin I just think is so
different because not a lot of anything
see it's like how cool prints like that
so I definitely think that this one is
gonna be a perfect bikini for the summer
especially with like the print and
everything
super trendy and really liked it and
this next bikini I showed you guys in my
last bikini haul I got this in a bunch
of different colors so I decided to also
get it in this teal blue color these are
just the bottoms the plain
cheeky bottoms with the little
spaghetti-like shops on the side they're
very thin and then the top is just a
plain triangle top and I wish I sized
down in this I don't know what how I
didn't remember from last time I got
this meeting suit that the triangles
were just kind of like big um so I
definitely recommend sizing down in it I
got a medium and in this bikini but I
should have probably gotten a size small
and this next bathing suit is like the
most popular baby who said they feel
like everybody gets on Zappo this is
what the top looks like it's just a
triangle top and it has this underwire I
don't think I've worn this one when I
was in Aruba but Emma ended up wearing
it so and sort of picture of Emma just
so you guys can see how the top fits
it's super cute it has like that little
little wire detailing I was telling you
then it just clasp in the back and the
bottoms are the same as all of the other
bottoms that I've been showing you they
are just cheeky Blakk clean bottoms I
love this bikini just because it is so
different with like the wire detailing
you feel like not a lot of ating suits
have that I just think it's a nice
different touch and it's super
flattering on and emma actually wore
this next bikini i'm going to be showing
you guys on the catamaran she got so
many compliments all of you guys are
asking her where her bikini was from and
it's just this white one that has kind
of a same sports bra look in the front
but the back is super cute cool because
it has like this little cage detailing
which i love I actually didn't wear this
bathing suit on the trip just because I
ended up leaving a few days early so I
didn't get to wear this one but mor they
looked so cute and I love the bottoms
because they have a thicker strap on the
side that isn't attached to the from the
back it's just like really different you
guys can see it's like stretchy and just
like all the other bottoms that I showed
you guys that sample has like this one
right here how it has the little thin
strap I really liked it this one because
of the thicker strap and last but not
least
baby is my favorite of them all I'll
show you guys the bottoms first it's the
same pattern as that polka dot one that
I showed you guys these ones are just
cheeky and look at the top it's so cute
so this one is just straight across but
I think that's the best part about it is
these ties on the side so you can adjust
the straps or however you want you could
tie them in a bow you could keep them
loose like this but I think that this
bikini is so cute I love this prints
with like the polka dots on it I don't
know what it is I just think that all of
these bathing suits with this pattern
are super flattering I just love it the
way that they look and I think it's so
different I think they're so cute better
than just your typical plain bikini so
that concludes my bikini Holi hope you
guys enjoyed this video I would love to
do one of these for the summer just
because I wore a lot of these bikinis
when I was in Aruba already and Zabu
bikinis are so affordable that when you
buy them you can literally get to so
many and it doesn't even cancel I think
all of these together cost like $200
where if you bought like a bikini that
was a high-end brand I think literally
the top is 100 and the bottoms are 100
as well so I got like a ton of bikinis
for the price that you would get for one
bikini and I think that that is so much
better than going out and buying one
that is really expensive just because
like I feel like during the summer when
I wear bathing suits I'm gonna wear it a
few times and then get sick and it
especially if I posted so many pictures
in it like this blue one right here with
the ties that I showed you guys if you
follow me in Instagram I already
boarding like 4 pictures so I feel like
there's not many more times that I can
wear it on my Instagram and like keep
repeating it so what I like about duffel
is that it's super portable and you can
just interchange them out and some of
the tops like if they're plain it's
solid you can like mix and match at the
bottom I think that's that's super cute
as well but I hope that you guys enjoyed
this video let me know if you would like
to see a more hauls on my channel thank
you guys so so much for watching and I
will see you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
