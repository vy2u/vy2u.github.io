today's video I have another honeyBun
haul for you you guys know that I am
obsessed with honeyBun they have the
cutest trendiest in most affordable
clothes ever their stuff is so bougie I
love it they kind of take forever 21 and
like put it up a notch so I will have a
link to their website down below I also
have a coupon code for you guys to use
if you guys want to order any of these
items let me show you in this haul and I
have a bunch of things to show you I'm
so excited so without further ado let's
get started the first thing I want to
show you guys oh my god I'm literally so
obsessed with it I cannot wait to wear
this it's this cropped shimmery sparkly
shirt with this really cool band at the
end and it's a black red and white
striped elastic band I think that that's
so cool and trendy right now and it also
has the same thing along the wrist right
here I just think that with a pair of
joggers and booties this would look so
bougie and like some hoops maybe curling
your hair and like a nice dramatic
makeup look or even something natural I
just really think that this is so cool
for going out I'm so excited to wear
this and the next thing I got are these
camo print kind of cargo pants that are
tight at the end there like jaggary and
they're this red camo I think that these
are so different and cool and I also
have a pair of these in green as well
but I just thought that these are so
different just to wear with a white tank
top and a pair of booties again
something so trendy and so bougie that
normally I wouldn't go out and spend a
ton of money on just because I know that
they have pants like this by the brand I
am jeah but those are like hundreds of
dollars so I just think that these are
so fun I don't know just to like take a
cool picture in and I'm going to Miami
next week for spring break so I think
that these are so Miami and they're so
bougie they kind of give you that look
of like batty if you know what I mean
I hate that I just said that but like
they literally do and then I just picked
up a few body suits I love body suits
just cos are so easy to put on and you
can wear literally anything with them
skirts jeans whatever you want to wear I
first picked up this taupe colored one
and this one is so cool it just has all
of this crisscross detailing down the
side and it is spaghetti strap and I
really really like to this color right
now just because it was so neutral and
I'm so excited to wear with the little
flips all down the side I just thought
that that was so cool I've never owned
anything like this so I'm so so so
excited to wear this and the next
bodysuit I picked up is just this plain
black seamless one and it just has again
spaghetti straps in a deeper V in the
front and I'm really excited to have
this because I don't actually have a
v-neck black bodysuit and this one the
material is so soft I'm so excited to
wear this I know it'll look perfect with
boyfriend jeans or a skirt and
definitely a black bodysuit is a
necessity to have in your closet and the
next bodysuit I got is just this red
lace one and it has the adjustable
straps on the back which I really like
I've been seeing a ton of people wear
body suits like this and they usually
wear them with like joggers and cool
boots and stuff so I just thought that
this one was super fun I have a pair of
Adidas joggers that I'm so excited to
wear with and it is a bit see-through
and the front so I don't know what I'm
gonna have to wear maybe like a little
bra let or at least like a sticky bra or
something but I just thought that this
was so cool you guys know the red is my
favorite color and I cannot wait to wear
this one I thought that it was so fun
and I just think that this is gonna be
so cute now that it's starting to get a
little warmer out and starting to be
like more springy I think that this is
going to be super cute to like go out in
wearing like a pair of joggers or even
boyfriend jeans and cute heels and like
curls hair like I don't have this like
vision in my head of me wearing this and
the next item that I got are just these
white joggers with this tie lace-up
detailing in the front and they have
little pockets in the front and two
little pockets in the back they're super
high-waisted which I love and also
they're not completely tight at the
bottom they just kind of go and they're
a little bit straight-leg but I thought
that these were so cute I am going to
Miami next week for spring break so I'm
gonna be bringing these with me when I
have a nice tan I think that these are
gonna look so cute with a little crop
tank top and you know why you can never
have too many pairs of joggers in your
closet and next I just picked up another
set from honey balm and it is this black
and white set with these white striped
detailing all down the sides of the
joggers and they are just high-waisted
with a drawstring and then it came with
a matching cropped hoodie and then the
hood just has this white stripe
detailing along the top as well and
just thought that this would be perfect
to have a black set just to wear like at
the airport when I'm traveling to and
from like going cost whatever it may be
definitely having a black set in your
closet is a must and the next thing I
got is so so so cute I totally forgot
that I even got this until now honestly
but it's this black romper and it has
this cross detailing in the back and it
has a completely open back the material
you guys is so soft I am obsessed with
that I cannot wait to wear it and
honestly a black plain romper is such a
necessity to have I know that I'm gonna
be getting a ton of use out of it I'm
gonna be wearing a dystonic logo with
literally everything and last but not
least I got this red dress it just has
this lace-up detailing and it is body
con and long-sleeved I got this for
Valentine's Day but sadly and my order
didn't come in before Valentine's Day so
I couldn't wear it but this dress is so
cute it fits so well in all the right
places and I loved the lace-up detailing
in the front that was so different and
I've never had anything like that before
and again like the romper I just showed
you guys the material is so soft
honeyBun has the best feeling clothes
like they're all so soft and it makes
you feel like you are not wearing
anything even though you're really
dressed up so it's honestly the best of
both worlds and that concludes my haul

enjoyed it again I will have a link to
