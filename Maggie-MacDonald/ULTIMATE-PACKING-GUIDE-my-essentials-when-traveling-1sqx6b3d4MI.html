welcome back to my channel today's video
I am going to be doing an international
packing guide not necessarily just
packing for any international trips this
can be for any trips whether you live
not in the US if you live in the US and
are traveling somewhere else just
anywhere you pack and feel like I've
traveled to so many places since the
start of 2018 that I kind of have like
got it down to like what I need to pack
in like what's enough for me and
essentials and I just wanted to take
this time to share all of the items with
you I made a list on my phone after
traveling to Italy this past week and I
just wrote down all of the essentials
that I think are necessary when going on
a trip and my biggest struggle when
packing was I used to always overpack
and I'd get to the airport in my bag
would be like 50 pounds or a little bit
over and I'd just take stuff out and put
it in my carry-on it was just a mess so
now I feel like I finally got it down
and it packed just enough stuff my bag
was 39 pounds and I actually bought
enough where it filled it up to 50 and I
was perfect going home
so definitely less is more when you are
traveling but like I was saying I have a
list on my phone of items that I just
wanted to share with you guys that I
think are very important when traveling
so I cannot wait to share them with you
guys and without further ado let's get
started
the first item on my list is sunglasses
when I went to Italy this was something
that I normally don't bring anywhere I
don't think Emma and I brought one pair
of sunglasses to Aruba which actually
was not a good idea at all just because
I have eyelash extensions as you guys
know well they're like really bad right
now they've all fallen on actually
getting them filled tomorrow but I feel
like now that I have them they like open
on my eyes more and I just like the way
that it looks when I don't wear
sunglasses in photos so I like haven't
been wearing sunglasses at all and I
didn't pack any when I went to Aruba and
then finally when I went to Italy I
think you know what I'm gonna pack up my
one pair for a bands like the hexagon
ones with the gold frame and I'll wear
those with like all my open so you can
still really go with everything and so I
packed them and I'm so glad that I did
because everything was so great and I
feel like I would wear them all day long
and it was so much easier to look at all
the sites we went sightseeing and stuff
like that so definitely packed
sunglasses if you're going on a trip the
next item on my list is whatever type of
like money and I don't really know how
to word that but like I went to Italy so
I have to bring euros with me and what I
did was I went to a bank or like an ATM
and they converted American dollars into
euros and you can do this I found out
when I got to Italy they actually have
ATMs and like places where you can go
and take out money but I felt like just
having euros on your person was so much
easier than just walking around with
your card because they do take credit
and debit cards but I just feel like
when you are getting like ice cream or
coffee on the streets it's just so much
easier to whip out like a dollar 50 or a
one-year-old 50 cents and pay with that
rather than using your card every time
and the next item on the list is a
backpack or a crossbody bag and when
traveling to Europe it's very common
that there are pickpocketers so they say
to bring like a bag that can cross over
your body like be in the front so if you
definitely have a crossbody I highly
recommend using one of those and I used
my little black backpack a lot on the
trip which is super helpful because I
could just put both straps on and it was
so easy to like walk around and go to
the different stores and how everything
in my backpack and not have to worry
about like holding anything in my hands
are super free so that was something
that I definitely think was necessary
and
on the list is comfortable sneakers or
even slide so for shoes when I went to
Italy I feel like I wore my Gucci slides
every single day just because they're
really broken in I actually have them
next to me right now
like they're so broken in and I just
feel like they're super lightweight and
comfortable and I could walk around all
day in them and they wouldn't hurt my
feet and even sneakers if you could get
like the right pair of sneakers I know
that if I brought my adidas Stan Smith's
I would've worn them every single day
so getting a comfortable pair of
sneakers or like a comfortable pair of
sandals that you know you can walk
around in all day and not get blisters
and not have your feet get really
irritated I think is definitely the way
to go and next on the list is fork this
is regarding like the clothes portion I
think definitely my favorite things to
wear when I was in Italy or even
traveling anywhere I love to wear
dresses and rompers because I just feel
like there's so much free like more free
and you can walk around in them and
you're just so comfortable and like when
I was wearing denim shorts my legs they
would like rub against my legs when it
was like getting hot out and like I'd
get sweaty and it was just a really
uncomfortable feeling having the denim
rubbing up against my legs like I really
did not like that so I avoided wearing
shorts and I just feel like packing
dresses and rompers is so much more
helpful because you literally just have
like your dress or your romper you don't
have to worry about like what shirt to
wear what shirt to pack like different
accessories to wear with shorts and
shirts and jeans and all of that so I
just feel like if you can wear our
offeror dress that's definitely way more
efficient and a better choice than
wearing like jeans or shorts and going
along with what to wear I brought my
denim jacket with me and honestly like I
would wear it every single night I just
feel like throwing on a denim jacket
over a romper or dress is a perfect
addition to any outfit and they're super
casual and comfortable as well and I
will have the denim jacket that I got in
Italy link down below for you guys as
well as my Italy haul so you guys can
see like what I bought there want some
of my favorite items were and the next
thing on the list is a water bottle this
is something that I wish I brought
because in Italy specifically they have
the really fresh water so all over the
whole entire country
you can like fill up your water anywhere
like I have
fountains and stuff and instead of
paying for a water bottle every single
time you can just bring a water bottle
and then fill it right up anywhere you
go and same with her boob at Emma and I
were like oh my god we wish we brought
our water bottles with us well I know
Emma brought hers but I didn't bring
mine and so I wish that that was
something that I had when I went on my
trip just because it's so much easier to
fill it up at water filling stations I
feel like they have them all over the
place wherever you travel so that is
definitely something to keep in mind
next time you go on a trip and next on
the list is chopstick I cannot stress
this enough like chopstick will be your
best friend when you want to trip
especially if you are going to a place
where it's gonna be sunny and you're
gonna be able to Sun all the time just
because it's gonna dry out your lips a
ton and you want to keep them
moisturized and hydrated so one of my
favorites right now is the super goop
like chopstick lip balm stuff and it has
30 SPF in it I'll have it linked down
below it's not expensive at all I think
it's like under $10 and I just think
that that one is so great it works
really well and keeps your lips super
hydrated and it also gives you a nice
little shine to them so that was my
favorite when I went to Italy and the
next on the list is melatonin and with a
six-hour time difference it was so
difficult to fall asleep and like adjust
to the time difference when I was in
Italy so definitely bringing melatonin
helps me a ton
I took a melatonin on the plane right
there and I slept the whole eight hours
and it was great and then Gretchen and I
also took a melatonin the first thing we
were there and it helped us like sleep
through most of the night to try to
adjust to the time difference but I
definitely should have been taking it
like consecutive lead night one night
after another just because it would have
helped me sleep better during the night
and I know you can get melatonin at any
drugstore they have it in gummy form
they have like little dissolvable pills
that you can just put on your tongue
they have so many different kinds if you
guys don't like taking pills you can
definitely get the gummies that works I
know emma has them and she loves them
and next on the list you guys should
definitely pack some wipes when you are
traveling and just like carry a little
thing of them in your bag whether it's
like this eatable gentle skin cleanser
wipes micellar cleansing wipes
anything really works just so you can
like wipe off your face if you're
walking around I know that it can get
super hot and sticky and like maybe you
just want to wipe off your hands your
arms wherever your face whatever it may
be
can just like pull away battery back I
feel like those are super helpful to
have I feel like on the bus ride I was
always taking on my c2fo wipes and like
wiping down my face and wiping my hands
and just making sure that I was like
fresh during the day because the worst
feeling ever is when you're walking
around somewhere for long periods of
time you start to feel like sweaty and
sticky I just really hate that
so definitely bringing wipes is a good
idea if you guys just want to freshen up
a little bit okay last on the list I
feel like this is one of the most
important things that well I mean at
least for Gretchen and I one of the most
important things that we wish that we
brought more of and that is snacks
because then there's such a big time
difference you're not used to like your
body eating at the times you're supposed
to eat like I would wake up in the
morning and I wouldn't be hungry because
it'd be the middle of night at home but
and then I would spend the rest of the
day and then I'd get hungry around the
time it was like breakfast time in
America which was completely normal and
then throughout the day I would just
like eat normally but and then it was
night time where it like really affected
me and I'd be laying in bed at night and
it would be 3:00 in the morning but
really nine o'clock at home when I
should have just have eaten dinner a few
hours before and it just was like the
weirdest feeling because I would get so
hungry and I wish that I had a snack in
the first night Gretchen actually
brought some kind bars with her which
were perfect so we ended up eating all
of them within like the first two days
they were gone so definitely if you can
bring any snacks with you like kind bars
or little things like that that are easy
to just store in your bag and like put
on the plane those will definitely help
you ton and even buying snacks while
you're there just to keep in your hotel
room I think is definitely helpful just
like keeping sex on you at all time so
you don't go starving like I did and
that concludes this video hope you guys
enjoyed it if there are anything else or
any other things that I think of that
you guys should bring I will leave it
all at down below I'll also have a like
numbered list of everything I talked
about just in case you guys like forgot
or anything and then I'll add some stuff
on the bottom and I think of anything
else and I hope that you guys enjoyed
