today's video I am going to be showing
you some new items that I got from Urban
Outfitters anthropology and Lululemon I
know that you guys like seeing hauls so
I just thought that I would sit down and
show you everything that I got and I
will have all of these items linked down
below for you to check out and if you
are not subscribed to my channel you
totally should I will be uploading daily
in the month of November and honor as it
being my birthday month and then my big
announcement I will be going into
vlogmas next month so basically for the
next like month and a half I'm gonna be
uploading every single day so you
definitely don't want to miss that
I will also have all of my social media
accounts linked down below
I am always using snapchat always
posting on Instagram so if you are not
following me on those who should totally
check them out and again I will have all
of these items linked down below for you
and without further ado let's get
started first I'm gonna start off with
the items that I got from Urban
Outfitters I did pick up the most things
from there I got a few items that I'm
gonna be wearing for my birthday and I
know Urban Outfitters can be pricey at
times but for me personally I think that
their clothes are such good quality and
they really fit well so for me I would
much rather spend the extra money
knowing that the clothes are gonna be
good quality and they're gonna fit me
the way that I want them to rather than
going to a place that is less expensive
and getting clothes that are gonna fall
apart that aren't gonna look good be
comfortable things like that so I really
like Urban Outfitters it's one of my
favorite store the first thing that I
picked up from Urban was just this camel
print Calvin Klein bra and it is one of
their triangle bras and it just looks
like that in the back I got this in a
size small the next I don't know I got
from Urban is just this cropped
long-sleeve thermal top I haven't really
into cropped like t-shirts and long
sleeves lately I wear them all the time
with my Lululemon leggings that's what I
basically wear every single day like
that with sneakers or my uggs in my long
jacket I really don't like to dress up a
lot I like to be very comfortable I
think that this top is such a good
staple in your closet because it's super
cute and it's also so comfortable the
material is amazing it's so soft it fits
so well I picked this up in a size extra
small and again it just looks like that
and it has such cute detailing on the
back as well it's not just a plain
thermal I really like how it has like
the ribbed arms and the darker stitching
I just think that it gives it a little
more than just being like a regular
long-sleeve shirt the next thing I got
from Urban is this romper that I'm gonna
be wearing on my 21st birthday I'm
Tuesday but I just picked up this velvet
romper from urban and I love the
detailing in the front how it almost
looks like it's a little skirt I think
that that's so cute instead of it just
looking like shorts and then obviously
since it's a romper it has shorts in the
back but my favorite thing about this
romper was the color I don't know if you
can tell on camera but it's kind of like
a shimmering blue almost and the best
part of it all is the ruched sleeve
detailing with these little ties I think
that this is so classy and it's gonna
look so good
so you guys should totally follow me on
Instagram I'm gonna be posting so much
on my Instagram of my birthday if you
want to see like how I style this romper
and the things that I wear with it just
check out my Instagram I'll have it
linked down below and the last item I
got from Urban is another rapper that
I'm gonna be wearing on my birthday
weekend when I'm gonna be staying in the
city with two of my best friends and
it's just this gold romper and it's
metallic I am obsessed with it it has
this detailing in the front that I think
is beautiful it's a very lightweight
material it's very dainty I think that
it's so classy and elegant and it looks
like this in the back on the zipper it
just has this really beautiful detailing
and it flows out on the edges which I
like on the sides it's such a
lightweight material I cannot wait to
wear this and pair it with like a fur
jacket and some really nice heels I
think that this is gonna look amazing
and it's absolutely perfect for any type
of holiday event that you have coming up
I know that for me I like to address a
little more like in the holiday spirit I
would say I don't really know if that
makes sense but I know for me I like to
wear things that are more sparkly and
different during the holiday
because you can't wear this type of
stuff all year round so this is the
perfect time to wear it I think that if
you have a Christmas party coming up or
anything like that
New Year's all the events coming up in
the upcoming months this romper is
absolutely perfect and I got this in a
size small I think you forgot to say it
before but I got the other romper in a
size small as well so those were the
items that I got from urban the next
store I went to was Lululemon and if you
guys know me you probably already know
what I'm gonna pull out of the bag and
it is another pair of my favorite pants
the Lululemon aligned pants I got them
in a size four and they are just these
high-waisted pants in this very thin
naked sensation material they're my
absolute favorite leggings in the world
I will never ever ever wear any other
leggings other than the lines I'm
obsessed with them I have them in like
10 different colors this is my second
pair of black ones I just feel like I
wear the black so often that I needed to
pick up another pair of that but I have
nothing but amazing things to say about
these leggings I think that if you are
looking for a good pair of leggings
that's gonna really suck you in that's
high-waisted the perfect length you
should definitely check out the lines
and last but not least I picked up a new
jacket from Anthropologie every single
year I get a different for a jacket from
Anthropologie and this year I decided to
pick up this one right here it's kind of
a cream color and it has these really
cute ties on the bottom I just love this
cinched detailing at the waist I picked
this up any size extra small and it is
the softest jacket in the whole world if
you guys follow me on instagram you'll
see that I wore this in Boston I think
two weekends ago and I just think that
it's perfect honestly having a fur
jacket in your closet dresses up any
outfit this one is amazing it's
definitely worth the price it's a little
bit more pricey than like a normal for a
jacket if you just went to like forever
21 or Lulu's any place like that but I
think again it goes with the quality of
the jacket it doesn't shed it's super
soft it's so warm and the inside is this
soft material mixed with a silk so it
just feels so nice on your body
and yeah I love this jacket so much
right when I saw it I knew that I have
to have it so that concludes my little
haul video for today I hope that you
