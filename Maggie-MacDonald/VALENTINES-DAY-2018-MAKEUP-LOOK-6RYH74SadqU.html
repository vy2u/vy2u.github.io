today's video I'm gonna be showing you
how I did this
super easy natural glowy look for
Valentine's Day I tried to make it as
easy and natural as possible just super
simple so you guys can follow along and
recreate it you definitely can add more
if you would like this is just the look
that I wanted to go for something that
is really really simple easy to create
looks natural and also looks flawless
and beautiful so if you want to see how
I got this makeup look just keep on
watching and give this video a thumbs up
if you like seeing these types of videos
I haven't really done a lot of sit-down
makeup tutorials so if you guys enjoy
this and this is something that you
would like to see in the future just
give this video a thumbs up and leave
all of your comments down below and
without further ado let's get started
so first I'm gonna start off with primer
I am using the soft matte pro filter
instant retouch primer by fenty Beauty
this one is my favorite
so I'm just gonna put a pea-sized amount
right onto my fingertips and then rub
this all over just to prime my face and
get it ready to put to foundation on
then I'm gonna start with the fancy
Beauty Pro filter soft matte long wear
foundation and I am in the shade 260 so
I'm gonna apply this using the Fenty
Beauty foundation brush and you can just
get this at Sephora
it is number 110 and I just feel like it
works a lot better when you apply your
foundation with the brush rather than a
Beauty Blender because the Beauty
Blender just really takes in all the
product and absorbs it I feel like it
ends up being a waste at the end of the
day so once I got the funky Beauty
foundation brush I just felt like it
made it such a huge difference not only
on the way that the foundation was
applied on my face but also I feel like
it just saved so much more product from
being wasted
I usually just apply the foundation
right to the brush and then put it
directly on my face and the thing that I
noticed about the Fenty's foundation is
that it actually oxidizes to match the
color of your skin
so I feel like right now right when I
put it on it like looks kind of funky
and like looks different colors but as
it like gets used to your skin it will
oxidize I love this foundation it
literally feels like liquid silk on your
face I've used so many different ones
but this one is definitely my favorite
right now and next I'm gonna be going in
with the match stick in the shade bamboo
and this is just what I use as a
concealer so I will apply this directly
under my eyes also on the bridge of my
nose a little bit on my forehead my chin
and my Cupid's bow
just to brighten up my face a little bit
and then I'm gonna be taking my same
foundation brush and just looking up as
I Pat the concealer into my under eyes
you definitely can use a Beauty Blender
for this step I just feel like using the
brush is what works best for me but it
doesn't really matter how you apply it
just always make sure when you are a
plain concealer you want to look up and
Pat just to make sure that it doesn't
crease or anything and then I'm just
gonna blend that into my chin and also
my forehead really just like brightens
up those areas of your face and then
after that I'm going to be taking the
match stick in the shade mocha and I'm
just gonna be using this as my cream
contour before going over it with the
powder that you will see a little bit
later I'm gonna apply this right
underneath my cheekbones and then put
some on my jaw line then I'm also gonna
be applying it to the sides of my nose a
little bit underneath like this and then
a few lines on my forehead like that
nothing too crazy this is usually just
what I do every single time that I
contour and then I take the same brush
that I was using before and just gently
blending that in and I know Rihanna has
a specific brush to blend in your
contour and your concealer so I'm
definitely gonna have to invest in one
of those just so I don't have to keep
using my same a foundation brush I think
it'll be really nice investment to
get one of those little brushes because
this is like what I do every single time
I go out as like the base for my face I
really like the fuzzy beauty map sticks
just because I feel like they're so
creamy and they really are easy to blend
out and they're pigmented and they last
really long I just think that overall it
just gives your face a really nice
flawless look so now that I'm done with
the base of my face using all of my
liquid product I'm gonna go ahead and
set everything that I just put on I'm
gonna be using the fancy beauty and vism
at blotting powder and this is in the
shade Universal it is just their
translucent powder and to apply my
translucent powder I'm just going to be
using the Real Techniques powder brush
and this is just a big fluffy brush I'm
gonna take some of that powder and apply
it all over my face just because for me
I like to have my foundation and
concealer and everything looking really
really matte and making sure it's not
going to go anywhere and after that I'm
gonna be taking the benefit hoola
bronzer on the same brush and just
applying some down my neck so my
foundation and everything match well and
you don't have a line because that is
not cute you don't want that so I just
take some bronzer and bronze myself up a
little bit down there next I'm gonna be
going in with the Kat Von D shade and
light palette and I'm gonna be using the
shade lyric which is this middle banana
shade right there and I'm just going to
be applying it with this little flat
brush from Sephora under my eyes and
looking up well applying a some light
powder and I like doing this just to
brighten up my under eyes a little bit
and make me look more awake I think that
it looks really really nice and then
after that I'm gonna be going and mixing
in these two darker brown colors on the
bottom just as my powder contour so I'm
just going to be using this more flat
brush and applying this right underneath
my cheekbones
just to give it a little bit more
definition and then I'm going to be
using the access powder to blend it into
my jawline and on the sides of my nose
I'm also gonna be taking the powder and
applying it to the sides of my forehead
to give myself a little bit of
definition up there too and then I'm
gonna be applying a teeny tiny bit of
blush I'm gonna be using the Tarte
Amazon clay 12-hour blush in the shade a
party and I'm just gonna take a little
bit of that on a blush brush and apply
it to the apples of my cheeks and
personally I like this color a lot just
because it's very neutral and subtle but
gives you a little bit more life to your
face without kind of like noticing and
making it seem obvious that you're
wearing blush and then once my whole
face is down I'm just going to set it
just to make sure that all the makeup I
just apply to stays in place and I'm
just using the fresh rose floral toner
this is amazing I love it so much I use
it as my toner and also my setting spray
so final step for the face is highlight
of course my favorite part of my whole
entire makeup routine I'm just gonna be
using this laura geller baked body
frosting face and glow and basically
it's just a giant highlighter this one
is my absolute favorite I just think
that it's so beautiful and so glowy and
I love how gold it is it's just a very
warm highlighter I love the way that it
applies and the effect that it gives you
so I'm just applying this right above my
cheekbones on the tip of my nose and
also on my Cupid's bow just like that
like come on guys look how glowy it is
I'm so obsessed with this my literal
favorite product in the whole world so
next up is brows and I usually don't
fill in my brows unless I'm going out or
like I'm going
to an event or anything so I'm just
gonna be using it the Anastasia Beverly
Hills brow pencil and rushing these
babies out and then taking the other
side and just lightly shading in the
ends of them I really don't know how to
do my brows at all so I'm just kind of
winging it i wing it every single time
honestly and yeah so that's what I'm
gonna do and then I'm gonna be setting
them with the anasazi a brow gel just to
make sure that they stay in place and
then for my eyes I'm just going to be
using the morphe palette this one is my
roommate's I don't own the morphe
palette but I've used this one in the
past and I really really like all of the
warm tones that come with it so I'm just
going to be using this orange e shade
right here on a little brush and then
just applying this right on my eyes like
in my crease area I really really really
like this orange color I think it's very
very neutral and natural and you guys
know that I'm all about the more natural
makeup looks so that's why I chose it to
come with this one you'd think that
since I am on YouTube that I know
everything about makeup but I don't so
I'm just kind of winging this and
applying it like into my crease area
just like that so I'm just gonna go over
that one more time it just to give it a
little bit more definition and what I
did is I just took this little tapered
brush and applied it right into my
crease area and this is all I'm gonna do
for my eyes I don't want anything too
dramatic I really just want something
natural that is what I love I didn't
wanted to dramatic look just because it
is for Valentine's Day and it's not like
you're gonna be like going out to a bar
like coping with your friends I didn't
want anything that was gonna be too
crazy just something that was going to
be beautiful and natural then I'm just
gonna be taking a small brush with a
lighter pink shade this one right back
here and I'm just gonna apply that into
the corners of my eyes just to brighten
it up a little bit
and after I am done with everything I'm
just gonna go ahead and set my makeup
once again one less time it's so
important to set your makeup with a
setting spray because I just feel like
it makes it look so much more dewy and
glowy and it makes it lasts so much
longer not something that I'm so bad at
that I need to get used to I need to
start setting my makeup a lot more
because it's something that I like
forget to do all the time but it's so
important and to finish off this look
I'm going to be going in with my
absolute favorite lip gloss of all time
and that is the NYX fortune cookie lip
gloss you can get this at any drugstore
I will have a link down below for you
guys whenever you see me wearing a new
to light lip color it is most likely
this one it's the only one I wear I just
think that it's such a gorgeous color it
looks great on everybody it's so
affordable as well you can get at the
drugstore it's like five dollars so
honestly everybody needs this in your
life it's so hydrating and so so so
creamy I'm just gonna apply that alright
ohmy lips
so that is the complete Valentine's Day
super super super easy makeup look I
tried to make this as simple as possible
and as natural as possible I hope that
