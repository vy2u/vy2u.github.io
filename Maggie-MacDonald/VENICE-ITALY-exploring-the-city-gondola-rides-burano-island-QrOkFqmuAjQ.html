my hair isn't literally a mess right now
but I'm just wearing this romper from
princess Polly and then my Puma sneakers
today with my little black backpack and
Gretchen and I literally are like so
late our tour guide was like you guys
need to get down the stairs for
breakfast at 7:30 like no later
it's literally 7:50 inward so dumb like
me vocally we were up at like 3:00 in
the morning like I don't know it was
just a mess and so now we're gonna run
downstairs it's not like I want to sit
down the II like eggs and bacon and all
that stuff that he was saying he was a
gal of Hollick traditional American
stuff and then they'll also have like
croissants and coffee and like want a
kiss on coffee so I don't really have to
brush down to the eggs and bacon but I'm
just hoping that we can like grab one
and then run out the door
but I'm really excited for today I think
said if you guys just see like
everything that we're doing consumed me
somewhere so much bye bye are you ready
yeah okay let's go
I see a turkey on the internet were late
today so that's what I'm seeing
here at sea which is just like that
look guys it's a leaning tower
I guess there's one in every single city
here
but yeah our tour guide told us that
there it was a leaning tower in every
single city yeah so you don't
necessarily have to go to the leaning
tower things that I love all these
buildings I love how you can sit outside
that little cafe I know look how pretty
that is all those flowers like the pink
building and the yellow building
I know we're on a tour right now and
this is weird cuz I can hear a tour
guide through my ear piece like you guys
can't hear it but we're on a tour right
now it's kind of cool how we can like
hear them everybody's just like quiet
cuz it
look how cool this is
you guys no house and staying with my
zodiac I'm gonna zoom in on this this is
like on the side of a building
and there's men right there scorpion how
cool is that remember our little
scorpion
what does this call the gun Gretchen
something day what is this place called
something de mark st. Mark's we've got I
almost call it st. Mario this is the
church right here and it has like
different mosaic paintings in it and
it's all made with glass and we're
learning about it right now
and our little headphones thank you I'm
so happy I'm getting hello I have my
brand-new money
yeah
okay I just stressed out with some
Indian what I like is to wait so how
much is this Gretchen and I just got a
little snack to hold us over because
lunch isn't until two o'clock and right
now it is 10:14 so we really need to eat
and so I got a little croissant with jam
already in it because originally I was
gonna get one of her regular croissants
that's in here and I got a regular one
and asked if there was Jim but they have
jam like filled inside of it which i
think is super cool about this place so
if you're ever in Venice and the st.
Mark's Square Plaza thing come to this
cafe it's really really cute but I wish
it got a cappuccino because we got this
coffee and they literally gave it to you
and they get to go cuff which is a
Styrofoam cup and cappuccinos that come
in cute little most like that so I'm
getting these matching about necklace
and bracelet right now I'm their real
goal like look how pretty there and they
literally just Sparkle I'll show you
guys what you look like when you're
thinking up thank you
oh my gosh it looks so good I love it in
the bracelet yes I'll put the bracelet
on too
perfect thank you oh my gosh like it's
them together they watch it they look so
good
I loved that yeah I love hope we could
just see like a little like I feel like
it's like a back we're in right now it's
like all these little side streets and
alleys with like little doors and
chocolates so cool so there's just a
bunch of little mini like ways to cut
through and all of these are stores and
it's just like stuff that's all handmade
I know and everything's homemade
handmade here and it's so authentic and
everything's also there were so many
restaurants everywhere
Wow
and then there's like bridges connecting
every side what does oh yeah but we're
like getting all of our shopping done
this of it's so much fun like going on a
trip and being able to buy stuff for
like the people that you care about I
don't know I just mix I just like it I
love giving people me too
this is so cute in here wait what what
is this I want to go in here guys I
don't know if you can see it's like a
cute little white like area with a
restaurant like little tables I wonder
what it is
if you guys can see there's like one
after another bridges connecting and
that's what connects all of the
different islands we found out that
they're all individual mini Islands when
we're on our tour yeah that's what she
said she said that all the bridges just
connect the different islands please I
was trying to show you
it's a lounge and garden it's so cute
I'm gonna go in there so bad it's all
gauges all oh it's part of a hotel
thought into the place I was just
showing you guys and it's part of a
hotel we literally just walked through
and this is like a little seating area
there's a bunch of tables it's like a
lounge and restaurant but obviously I
don't think it's open right now and then
this is so cool it just opens right up
to one of the canals and then all of the
little gondolas are going through
and there's like a bunch of mirrors it's
so artsy here like we're taking so many
pictures I'm Gretchen and I found this
really cool mirror and she's taking
pictures right now like look how cool
this looks neo is driving us on the
gondola driving riding what are we doing
paddling stay hi to the blog enjoy
I wonder if they're all friends
by Antonio I was so cool this area is so
pretty
so we finally just got to Burano which
was really long all right but it was
kind of like relaxing just to sit I was
kind of spend the boat but it's really
sweaty I'm so sticky right now we get to
shower later and it feels so good I know
I thought that you guys are gonna freak
when you see this nice it's so nice
you're gonna tweak out tweet like I love
these little shops that are all homemade
and stuff and look at all of the
different buildings there are all
different colors and I guess the reason
why they're different colors is because
the men who used to live here were
fishermen and they would have to go home
at night and in order to find the house
if they lived out there but would be
colored the same color as their house so
that's what we learned today and also if
you buy a house here you're like not
allowed to change the color that you
have to leave it the color that you buy
it by the way that's our tour guide
Jason Tyson exhibitions okay
I wish that we didn't just eat because
this place is so keen I'm gonna show you
guys River Rosa what is it called
miss wheet where are we Bharat Verano
yeah we're on Verano I keep forgetting I
want to call it Bharata but that's the
cheese that that you and I like but look
how cute it is I have little tables and
then the inside is so cute you want to
go guys I really am like loving this bag
right here it's a handmade bag and I
like how it has the two straps like this
one is like a crossbody as well so and
then you could like hold it like this
and then it has this really cool
detailing also on the bag and this is ox
I don't know I just think that the color
is so amazing I really really like it
and I don't know I just feel like
sometimes I get sick of holding my black
bag in my life back I get like I want
something different in a few bar like
over the lose your bag we're like I love
your bag where'd you get it
I can be like oh it's handmade in Italy
I just think that's so cool that's like
unique it like nobody else would have it

really tell I was gonna say that's the
leaning tower of Murano but I don't know
but um we're leaving right now I just

gorgeous bag I've ever seen in my whole
entire life
