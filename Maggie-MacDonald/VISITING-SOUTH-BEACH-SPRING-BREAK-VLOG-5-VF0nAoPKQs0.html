today I'm wearing this I so stressed I
showed you guys in my packing Paul blog
thingy and my Molly Jace women bikini
we're going out to breakfast at free
life cafe right now it's around 9
o'clock we slept in a little bit this
morning really good and nice and this is
so cute
look at those little palm trees Kaylee's
been really wanting to eat breakfast
Kaylee's really wanting been wanting to
eat breakfast by a palm-tree what he's
on Instagram
are you insane oh my god what's his name
hi
yeah but I want to look at a little menu
thank you I don't know what to get I
kind of want to get a breakfast burrito
or not people really don't know yes what
I got breakfast I got a breakfast
burrito wrap thing with avocado and egg
and what else that I got at peppers
turkey bacon
avocado you got onion no tomato tomato
and tomato and a ginger shot and then
Kaley got avocados which are to eat it
and I don't know it just so nice I was
really enjoying like the warmth and
everything but we're gonna go after this
and get coffee from the place that we
liked before just because we're so
accessible but it is really really windy
so I wanted to tell you guys I realized
why this coffee is so strong and my dad
told me that it's because it's Cuban
coffee
and normally I drink black coffee at
home anyway but this coffee is
especially strong because it's from Cuba
and that's just the way it is I guess
the coffee's really strong but it's
really good with a little bit of almond
milk in it
so if you guys are ever in Furcal in
Miami you guys should go to friends
marketing cafe and get their iced coffee
with a little bit of our milk because
it's really really good
it's supposed to be getting a little
storm today I think this afternoon but
I'm not sure how good that's gonna be I
feel like every single time you look at
the weather when you're in somewhere
warmer or tropical it means that it's
just gonna rain for a few hours like in
the afternoon so I think we'll be okay
during the day her son and like laying
out today right now but it's really
cloudy and it was
so we just added up with a dragon-like
and the reason why we have it any better
just the community just a communication
because we're always like going going
going next were like we're going out so
much you know between upstate like we
want to go away
so today
cute
and we got this one right here so it's
dragging through with mango pineapple
banana almond milk chocolate coconut
blueberry strawberry granola and I added
almond butter
we got our bowls finally and then we
also got to get banana bread just to
share because it looks really really
good I'm really excited to try this
Wow like a really pretty color I know
with the dragon fruit is it good this is
really funny I used to have the same
exact handle home - when I was younger
and my dad got it for me from the -
Miami and that's where we are right now
I like forgot about the Kardashians like
hold this lace and you still like work
here before they got really big it's so
funny these are all so hard
so funny there's like emoji
I wonder if the Kardashians still
actually pick out all this stuff you
know it's to Sidious you know I just
don't really like cities in general get
it girl
I don't know man play was from yes cuz
I've been getting a lot of I'm
where it's from so my top is urban
bathing suit small you swim shorts are
Topshop sabbatic is made
and then on the heat I'm just wearing my
eyewear and this is our gym - I'm like
excited to go home right now my hair is
yucky in our car it's really cute inside
I'll give you guys a little cart or I
always forget I don't need my keys it
isn't much to start so where's the
button hey I'm just like I should get
ups we just got home and I've never been
happier to be old it's so yucky out
today I'll show you guys what it looks
like outside but it looks like this gray
and rainy yucky but it feels good right
now because we are in a sea and it's
warm
well not like warm but I don't know I
just like the feeling of being in the
a/c but yeah and the cleanliness that's
what I meant it feels clean and good
nothing but fresh so I'm gonna take a
shower and then get in bed and edit some
videos right now and then I think Katie
and I are gonna film a roommate tag
oh we just spoke up he took a really
long now but time to fall asleep like
four I thought sleep so early I pass out
I was so tired and I will go about like
seven but I just made dinner and
I'm having just chicken and steamed
broccoli and carrots I was gonna wear
order sushi but I didn't feel like
waiting for the overeats to come and sup
so ya struggling trying to figure out
how to turn on this TV this just really
goes to show how much I watch TV oh I
did it yeah what do we watch okay I'm
gonna show that what I got wait I
ordered up are you kidding
I'm upset I ordered a water you did yeah
and they didn't give it to me that's
really sad I was really thirsty
whatever movies but this is what I got
in case you're wondering oh whoa I don't
know he got funky but I got a crate and
then I got a lot of cake right here that
one looks really good and it also came
with gelato and I just got vanilla wait
I should have got a flavor because that
like looks good I just wanted to end off
the vlog here because my friend really
actually texted me and was like Maggie
fan ending your vlog so abruptly
which I really have because I feel like
I always forgot to end them off and like
do a little sign-off whatever size you
want to end off the vlog here we end up
just like hanging out at our Airbnb
tonight and relaxing because we napped
all day for like the afternoon because
it was raining so we didn't like end up
going out or anything we just made
dinner at home and I'm uploading the
