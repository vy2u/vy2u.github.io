go to Florence
yeah let me get that cuz I can gather
like we need to be better with a tech
management
before I was
we've got a plate we make requests
pretend like we were sitting into
everything
anyway so we're going to go
that is actually not unregistered
baby
this driver
so we just arrived in Verona and we're
walking to like the center of town
we just got dropped off by our bus but
this body suit that I'm wearing today is
from three people I'll have all of the
clothes that I wear and on my videos or
in like blogs and stuff linked to tell
below just what super easy guys
to get them he wants him but anyway this
body suit is like really love when it's
falling down it's so uncomfortable
because we're walking around all day
like doing stuff and making super active
I'm like trying to cross the street I
don't really know how it works here I
don't know if they stop for you or
the GLA
okay I guess but anyway so Gretchen came
up with this really good idea that she's
gonna cut the straps in the back of it
and then we're gonna tie it as a halter
just so it like doesn't fall down
because I feel like that's been like my
struggle okay I'm like oh so annoying
but we're going to do that as soon as we
find scissors which we need to do
probably at the gelato place
okay so I actually just came up with a
really good compromise on my own yeah
show them this is what she did yeah she
just tied it with a little hair tied and
then my hair to cover it anyway
so now I don't have to cut my body soon
it'll be sold better
everywhere you go and every it's just
like so good for futures and
like you guys know that my club where
did you just tell by the side unless
it's not but it looks like it well if it
isn't gonna have to go but anyway so
whether I shouldn't all the places are
near Big Show musical pictures they got
owner we do when I leave like sad but if
it is Agee I can tell by the letter my
face guys why do we always find it when
we're not even trying
so our first stop was at a gelato place
where are these having to kind of remind
us because it's so hot out that they
think about these super great I'm gonna
mess up a little bit but it's called
fetishy
you guys can see on my little cup and I
got peach and it's so good the lemon so
good isn't it refreshing
we thought least we should get like
refreshing ones instead of like
chocolate or olive the chocolate peanut
butter I know we wanted think really
refreshing ones like fruity ones just
this morning but super getting now I'm
like so excited to go and explore okay I
think this is very Memorial this is
where her Romeo and Juliet like Juliet's
house is and everybody's taking pictures
in front of a school it's really cool it
has like a notes on it and we're gonna
love wall oh my god Maggie please Tyler
I think I wish I had a pen I would write
something this is really really cool
this is so weird that we're here right
now
but I used to learn about the stuff in
school you guys know I hate that school
but wait this is so cool
I'm gonna take a bunch of photos right
now this is the Statue of Juliet I guess
it's good luck if you like get up and
take a photo with her it's like good
luck in love so this is like the little
main market in the middle of Verona it's
so cute as you guys can see there's like
little food cups these ones are really
cool they're like fresh fruit and
in the fruit here's the freshest then it
could be anywhere because there's no
preservatives or anything like there is
in the States
and comfort all of it
I want to get something they bring it
with us on the bus to our bus ride
I want something Gretchen and I are
trying clothes on in this really cute
Italian store like I really like this
dress I don't know what from like loving
like a MIDI dresses and I don't know I
just like how this one's like B I can
wear it with like some cute sneakers or
something and just big super comfortable
I like walking around here but I have a
ton of other stuff that I'm trying on so
I will show you guys as well alright and
I just tried on this denim jacket the
lighting is super bad I'll try to come
more out here if you guys can see it
looks just like that and I don't know I
just really like the color and I like it
like the fit of it and the size like the
sizing and how it fits me
I forgot to show you guys honestly we're
in like a rush because we only have so
much time any city and then got tonight
also getting these shirts that say
sister season because her and I call
each other sister always like hey says
sorry me at ease and I think when you
get these two dresses and then also this
jacket we got a real Italian caprese
panini and it came on this like olive
bread and Gretchen and I both got them
in Verona at one of the little
restaurants over there we wanted to sit
out and eat it outside and get like a
little drink and stuff but we don't
wanna have that much time but it
literally is so good like the bread is
so fresh and so is the mozzarella flake
doesn't taste anything like they do at
home
so we finally touched down in Florence
right yeah and so we are going to dinner
now but Gretchen and I finally like
we're hoping that we're gonna be on time
I'm down here I don't think so no that's
the one that has seats on the top but
I'll show you guys a little bit of a
view that's outside of our room and
that's so pretty
that's gorgeous and we're staying at
this like camp hotel please yeah we just
arrived today and I'm exhausted we were
on the bus for so long and we were just
like running around and all sweaty so I
just finally took a shower
I'm very fresh and they feel super clean
and there are people from our group up
ahead in front of us so it's good that
we're not late but um out for tonight
I'm wearing this free people bodysuit
with this skirt from forever 21 and
these Tory Burch sandals because I think
that they're really comfy even though
Tory Burch's so I don't know I feel like
it's like outdated I guys saw this which
is the old me yeah Tory Burch was
allergic to I used to wear Tory Burch
flats all the time in high school but oh
and then I'm wearing these great bands
but like I said we'll have everything
linked down below and so we just got in
the bus I wanna turn mine down Gretchen
turn down her brightness on her game
good no no we just got onto them into
the bus direction and I got these two
little funnies in the front driver
it's the brought in that Gretchen and
they were talking about last night
well we were talking about Farhat all
day because we like that but we need the
buffalo monster last night and for
dinner I just got a traditional
margarita pizza and they're cooking it
and those like little brick like stove
things and I saw someone eating it over
there looks so good if I ordered one now
we're waiting for it to be finished and
then Gretchen's over there and she's
ordering constant we're gonna like do
pulls so she's gonna have floss and I'm
gonna have that little pizza good he's
gonna freak out when she sees it I have
to carry it on this big
thing right here and go show her I'm
gonna get her reaction no way it was
just like Gretchen's gonna make that
look so good doesn't it look so good so
Gretchen finally got her pasta yeah and
we got our Jose and now we're gonna eat
and then there's so many places to get
dessert around here
weird I look sweaty too
there's so many places to get dessert
around here from some sort of dessert I
have to take my red lip off because it
was everywhere so an update on the pizza
Gretchen and I agree that this is
literally the best Margaret Pizza we've
ever had in our whole life because it's
just so like light there's something
about it I think it might be like that
the cheese isn't as heavy as it is at
home the sauces and that's how it as
heavy and the bread is literally fluffy
like it doesn't look like it would be
but it's so good and you can tell that
Gretchen is loving it it's so good in
this lady I don't know where she just
went so there was just this lady walking
around was like taking pictures for any
believe and Gretchen and I really taking
all these pictures and she thought it
was the funniest thing they got taking
pictures of our food and like choosing
your drinks and like doing the ring so
she was like taking professional
pictures of us like form the restaurant
up and it was so funny and then she was
like oh I'll give you a picture so
hopefully they were really really cute
and then they were like on her
professional camera and she was like
taking them from like I was so cool the
other side of that huge Church in the
middle affords whoa this thing is huge I
like I wonder what the inside looks like
sometimes I can start blogging and or
you start talking and then you start
blogging a new big so this and then you
click like I probably did but everybody
loves it mm-hmm a picture together for
five minutes oh he wants to like draw
our heads it's like a staff hunting okay
so we're finally home and I didn't vlog
my gelato I literally forgot all about
it just because I feel like I've had
such a long day and I'm just like in a
haze right now and I need to go to bed
I'm still like not really used to this
whole time change thing it's really
weird because right now it's ten o'clock
here in Florence but at home it's four
o'clock and like I'm hungry on the
schedule at home like when we wake up
here I'm not hungry but I get hungry
around like lunchtime afternoon because
it's like morning time at home when I
should eating breakfast I don't so
weirdest CAD tool so basically right now
like I'm gonna keychains it in lock up
my gelato but you guys have seen so many
like vlogs of gelato we actually had a
lot of earlier so you guys would have
seen that we had it twice today but
tomato got like a really mini one it was
like a tiny tiny scoop of the fresh
berry one it was really good I had like
a little seeds from the raspberries that
they made it with but it was so good and
we're so tired so we're gonna go to bed
