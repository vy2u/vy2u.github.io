back at school number one this is my
first day back in my classes I'm already
running late what's new but I just want
to do a little intro because I am gonna
be daily vlogging now that I'm back
because you guys seem to really like the
Miami vlogs I don't want to stop doing
it it's so much fun so I'm just heading
out to class right now this is what I'm
wearing 750 this morning I'm wearing a
Zara
t-shirt Brande sweatpants my mini Uggs
and then just my jacket and yeah so I'm
gonna go to class now get that over with
wish me luck I just got home from my one
class that I had today at 8 o'clock and
usually I have another class right after
at 9 and then another at 10 I get three
in a row all done Monday Wednesday
Friday but my two other ones today got
cancelled so I was so happy about that
and I came home and I had a ton of stuff
to ship on Poshmark literally this whole
area in front of the fireplace of my
apartment was all full of Poshmark stuff
like it was all on the ground finally
got all that shipped out then I got a
coffee and which one was my new one this
one right here and I just get toasted
almond from Mary Lou's it's so good you
guys can order Mary Lou's coffee online
so I'll put a link to their website down
below my favorite flavors are toasted
almond banana not in blueberry and I got
this one and it didn't taste good so I
drew a different Mary Lou's and got that
one and this one so much better I don't
know what was wrong with that one maybe
like something just happened when they
were brewing it or whatever I have no
idea but I have to fill out this
passport application because I'm going
to Aruba for 11 days in May with my dad
and my sister so I have to do that drink
my coffee and now I'm gonna make
breakfast so this is just what I have
every single morning you guys know
already if you've been watching my vlogs
for a while I just have two pieces of
sprouted cinnamon raisin is the keel
bread and then to scold eggs so I'm
gonna go ahead and make this and then
Kayleigh is gonna come home
really soon and then we're gonna hang
out for a little bit because she's going
on vacation with her boyfriend this week
for their one-year anniversary so we
just want to hang out before she left so
I'm gonna make this right now and then
eat get ready and we're gonna do
hopefully something fun today so now I'm
back
I had just laid in bed for a few hours
actually not even a few hours probably
like an hour I've been watching YouTube
videos and snapchat and Gretchen and
Emma in our little group message on
snapchat
they're like being really funny right
now I miss them so much but I need to Oh
Gretchen that's the funniest video and I
was like please tell me that you saved
that like that video was so funny and
she saved it she just sent it so yeah
but she's in Porto fire a little
something right now with Tasha and it
looks so much fun like so it looks like
so much fun and I'm so jealous that she
doesn't have to go to school right now
but I'm gonna be making a little snack
and so while waiting for my bagel to
toast I'm just gonna talk to you guys
about I don't really know I don't really
have anything to say but I'm gonna be
filming a bunch of videos today to
upload this week just because I'm
clearly not doing anything right now
so I think I'm gonna sit down and do a
few videos I know I have a Q&amp;amp;A to film
oh it's done actually make it more
crispy
no no no the peanut butter oh my god it
looks like a smiley face and so for the
finishing touch I'm just gonna take
these little slices of banana put them
all around so now this is what I'm gonna
do I'm gonna eat my little bagel thin
with the banana and peanut butter and
sit in bed and watch Olivia Jade's old
videos and I'm gonna continue to
snapchat Gretchen and Emma and yeah
that's what I'm gonna do I have my
coffee still right here but I don't know
I don't really like it today and they
also need to start drinking more water
because I want to start drinking 3
liters a day again because I feel like
ever since I got back from Spring Break
I haven't been drinking that much water
so I'm gonna start doing that but I'm
gonna watch some videos eat this I'll
check back any of you guys when I'm
doing something more exciting I just
wash all these grapes right here I have
two huge things of them and I decided
that I think I'm gonna keep one box to
eat normally and freeze the other one
maybe I'll even them out a little bit
more just because I've heard that frozen
grapes are really good snack they're
really refreshing
and I'm always craving something like
cold and sweet after I eat dinner
aka ice cream you guys know I'm obsessed
with ice cream but you know I'm gonna go
on a grind right now and I told myself
that I need to like stop eating it as
much as I do just because I eat it so
much that it's probably not the best for
me obviously I'm still gonna have an
imitation but it's seriously like an
every night thing so I just decided to
free some grapes and I'm gonna put some
of them in my freezer right now right up
top and then I'm gonna actually bring
these in my bed with me because I'm
gonna go back and lay in my bed and keep
watching videos but I was just kind of
hungry again that little bagel that I
was eating it didn't really fill me up
that much yeah some grapes and this is
what I'm doing today I know you guys
want to see vlogs and I hope that you
guys still like this and like want to
see what I'm doing during the day but
yeah this is what I'm doing I really
need to get after it and get my passport

might have to get it expedited because I
might have to go somewhere out of the
