today's video I just thought I would do
like a little casual vlog I'm gonna be
going out and doing some errands today
and like when shopping and stuff so I
just thought that I would bring you
along with me and show you my favorite
stores and like things that I'm trying
on things that I'm loving right now that
are like obviously in the stores that
I'm going to I get a lot of questions
about where I like to shop and things
like that so I just thought it'd be fun
to bring you guys along with me on a
whole shopping day and I am dressed
super casual today it's really really
really cold out where I am in
Massachusetts it's like 50 degrees but I
still wanted to dress a little bit cute
I'm just wearing this tee that says
darling on it and it's from naked it'll
be featured in my haul video that's
coming up that I'm going to be doing
with Emma and then I'm also wearing my
blank and my C leather jacket I will
have all these items linked down below
and I just have on my favorite Lululemon
leggings and they are the black
Lululemon the line leggings along with
my adidas Stan Smith sneakers I am such
a sneaker person when it comes to shoes
I love sneakers I just love being comfy
casual I think they're super cute so I
am going to just get my bag all filled
up like with everything that I'm gonna
be needing today and yeah so let's get
started I just got in the car and it is
11:30 I did have class this morning I do
go to class I do go to school full time
I take five classes in college I am a
junior I'm studying marketing I got out
of class at 10:45 so now obviously it's
like 45 minutes later and I just wanted
to get some air and scent today that's
why I'm gonna go do all this stuff and I
do go to school I just want to make that
clear I do go to school I take classes
I don't just shop all the time but I
thought that I would pick up some fall
things and show you guys since you guys
have been all asking me about doing a
fall haul so yeah I just have to like
see em park in the
parking garage that's my little work
right there if you can see it that one
but so I just got here people are used
to see people walk around with a camera
but so I just got here and it's called
legacy place for those of you who live
in Massachusetts I feel like many of you
might know what it is but basically it's
like an outdoor mall and it just sounds
like a ton of stores it has like urban
outfitters few people anthropology it
has a soul cycle just like so many
places like that and I think that
they're opening up a sweet green here
it's open yet I know that they are
opening one soon but yeah right now I'm
just gonna go to urban I want to look at
a lot of their fall stuff so I'm gonna
go do that now and then the video but no
photos I'm gonna have so much stuff I
have like a bunch of sweaters over here
a t-shirt some sweatshirt some jeans and
I'm gonna try all of these on because I
think I don't really have like that many
fall things and then I realized hey I
was like oh my god it's already so cold
out and they don't have any sweaters so
I'm gonna start getting into wearing
sweaters so I'm gonna turn on all of
these and show you guys what they look
like oh my god this winter is literally
so comfy and I love the way that it fits
and I've tried on a lot of these things
over here oh well this is so cupid it
looked awful on it was just way too
short in the front maybe I'll have to go
down a size because they just like fit
me awkwardly but I think that this is so
cute and I think that I'm gonna just
wait to show you guys everything and put
it all in like a fall haul cuz I know
I'm going to be getting a lot of false
up today I just want to show you this
because it's literally so cozy I don't
even want to take it
my body I love it it would look so cute
with like jeans and sneakers or if
leggings looks cute so this is what I
get so conflicted I just got this huge
bag and this huge huge bag from Urban
Affairs which I'm going to show my next
haul video but I spent like $130 and I
just people and I found this really
really cute
fall sweater oh my god I was like chunky
and soft and just like the best material
ever I look at the price tag and it's
128 for one sweater so that's right like
really confuses me where I don't think
I'd ever go into people and buy
something full price I do have a lot of
things from free people don't get me
wrong and I love their clothes is just
like one sweater for $120 I can't
justify I could never do that to myself
I don't know
I'm having a really good day it's such
like a fall vibe here and I wish that
like one of my friends were here to take
an answer and pitch for me I'm really
sad
but I'm gonna go into Antho right now
you guys these are literally the best
candles in the whole world if I could
have one thing it would be that giant
candle right there but it's like over
$100 I love it so much it smells so good
and how cute are the little containers
that they come in like they're
aesthetically pleasing and they smell so
good oh my god
I literally needed this jumper for my
21st birthday I need it okay thank you
so I'm in mr. Brooks drive-thru right
now and I'm done shopping I went to made
while Urban Outfitters like a ton of
other stores I didn't end up getting
anything from any of the other ones but
I'll show you guys what I got from Urban
Outfitters and made well I got so many
good things for fall I'm so excited it
just makes me really put away all my
warm weather clothes because honestly
I'm never gonna be able to wear them
again okay thank you um could I please
have a grande hot chai tea unsweetened
with just seemed almond milk no not the
latte could I just get like the teabag
yeah and then put steamed almond milk in
it yes that's it thank you that was like
really complicated but so I am gonna
show like everything I got when I do my
official haul
and
I need to put my Starbucks app but it
was so hard for me to like vlog while I
was like in the stores looking on stuff
because I just feel like
I was like really focusing on trying
things on but I feel like I'm gonna get
a ton of questions in this video about
my eyelashes I don't know if you can see
them
I do have eyelash extensions I'm going
to be doing a video about like my full
eyelash extension experience and like
how I like them and how much it wasn't
like all of that but I'm going up to the
little ones
and waiting for me a little on the road
charlie
I'm so excited does anyone else's hair
get like really staticky and gross and
it's cold out or suggest me because I
drag - disgusting right now
thank you okay guys now I'm gonna go
back to school to go back to my farm
right now but I'm gonna put the camera
away so I'm driving
there's like a lot of traffic I'm gonna
focus but I will catch you guys later
I'll check back in when I get back home
and yeah so I'm finally home I had to
like go bring my car to this like auto
body repair shop place cuz this guy
backed into my car not once but twice a
few weeks ago and so I had to bring my
car there just so they could like look
underneath the hood and see if anything
was wrong with it
and stuff so that's what I did after I
went shopping and now I'm just literally
chillin in my bed I'm so tired
I look like an egg right now but I'm so
tired and it's freezing in my apartment
I need to figure out how to like work
the heat or something in here cuz it's
so cold I just thought I would end the
vlog here I'm just like chillin at my
apartment I'm gonna edit this vlog and
have this be uploaded tomorrow and I did
want to make an announcement
