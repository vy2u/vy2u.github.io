Easter Sunday and it just woke up in him
I just got home from our friend's house
and this mirror is so dirty but this is
just what I'm wearing
today this little army green t-shirt
from Zara and then my gray Lululemon
aligns just cuz I felt like I don't know
kind of like loose and from being
joggers this morning so I just decided
to put on some yoga pants and I just
also wanted to give you guys our view of
the lineage lip mask that I was using I
woke up in my lips are like so hydrated
and they feel like plumper I really
really like it
so I highly recommend that lip mask I'm
gonna keep using it and I'll have a link
for it down below for you guys just in
case if you wanna like check it out
forget it so every night row we got
bagels and stuff right now and get our
teeth right
and I'm also obsessed with the new like
body spray thing that I got I have that
link down below for you too
and then I just came downstairs and our
dad got us these little Easter baskets
and we both like got the same thing in
them so I'll just show you guys what I
got so I got my favorite gum which is
just the Mentos gum and then some little
M&amp;amp;Ms Easter eggs and some crunchy peanut
butter that's organic which is my
favorite peanut butter of all time and
then Reese's eggs because you guys know
that I love Reese's in my favorite candy
and then also this is my favorite jam
and I always eat this on the dakhil
bread or like our little English muffins
that we eat it's just these strawberry
preserves and then we also got some pink
thin bars and these are the peanut
butter ones and then some peppermint
patties a little card and also a Mary
Lou's gift card
well last time we were here together was
like on a server but we were with our
lady
and we did like a little photo shoot
over the beach and seven packs or like
Amazon
and it was like right when you guys
became friends I like a little bow yeah
after because we've been here was after
getting over somewhere true
we're doing something
I've gotten everything bagel with
sun-dried tomato monster like cream
cheese I can't even show me downstairs
so first but I've been craving this
because I think the best bagels and the
best cream cheese of are I don't like
cream cheese if it's anywhere else but
here me choke what best ones really
really really good
and this is the surprise we seriously
have a problem we're obsessed with Mary
Lou and the lady knows my orders oh my
god that sounded like at my school they
know my order at school like I walk into
wall my hair's crazy but I walk into
Mary Lou's at school and the girls that
work there like Auto smell em and I'm
like yeah and I just gotta toss it all
in black
but we're gonna go get coffees now I'm
really upset because I used to like the
flavor of the month from March which was
coconut cream pie and I would do that
and mix with toasted almond and it was
so good but now it's able first and like
they have a new flavor the month and I
have no idea what it is but hopefully
it's like a good one
finally I'm so excited I got banana-nut
today and was already very very excited
now time to go home but oh look at my
background but I thought this is so
funny this little poop emoji I'm gonna
send you shithead
guys I'll fill you in a second we're
doing a prank on Gretchen in Ireland one
sec hi Gretchen hi Gretchen
so do you want to say it me yeah I know
I think you should say it
what a guy thank you my god same things
okay I'm sorry okay well so this is are
you really in crying oh my god
okay well then give me your phone in
here right now but so okay
and I like stop crying buddy
we like decided that because our dad
told us like this morning we like came
down for Eastern he was like oh like I
got a new job and like we have to move
to Florida and like me and i'ma have to
like quit YouTube we're not gonna be
like doing any of this anymore like
we're moving to Florida
for my dad's why hello hi sorry we were
on FaceTime with Gretchen and was gonna
why are you crying again Emma she keeps
[Laughter]
calling like God she did this with
Gretchen - she answered she's like hello
and then Gretchen's I hide and was like
then she starts crying okay because like
no can you hear me oh it's because my
the speaker was covering her phone um so
um where do I start how did I start with
Gretchen wait number the corner
well basically like our dad um told us
that
he like got a new job and stuff and it's
in Florida so like me and Emma are
moving to Florida and not doing YouTube
anymore yeah really yeah really yeah why
wait really
are you being serious oh my god you're
smart you're so Gretchen was like in
tears I could have told Gretchen that I
was leaving the country and like not
having a phone for the rest of my life
she could leave me like she's like so
like oh my god that's so funny just go
back to my apartment and I'm in the
process of cleaning out all my stuff
from the weekend so I need to organize
everything when you make it products and
stuff that I got and get everything all
put away
okay and this is my biggest problem
right here this is basically my makeup
drawer and I like keep everything that
has to do with makeup in here and as you
can see it's like getting way way way
too overflowed and I just like don't
know what to do I honestly might have to
get new Alex drawers and have like two
sets of them in my room or something or
maybe but one in my closet I don't know
what to do I'm gonna have to like start
to think of a something else maybe if I
put one of my claws that I could put
like a little tank tops and stuff in
them like even like the bigger ones I
could put like socks
and like my sports bras and bra lats and
all of that but actually might be a good
idea and then I could put like extra
stuff that's in here that I don't need
like out in the open in my closet but I
just got this spray which you guys know
I've been loving and I am going to be
using this for perfume instead of my
vanilla one which is almost gone so
thank God it's almost gone just because
I want to switch over to start using
this one right here just smells super
fresh and yummy oh my god I also wanted
to talk about my Linda Gillette mask oh
my god guys like I mentioned it a little
bit earlier this morning just how I've
been loving it so much and I slept with
it on last night and it was super
hydrating and nourishing but literally
today I didn't have to keep applying
chapstick on my lips which I normally
have to do so I'm so excited to use this
again tonight and I'm gonna go through
and organize all these drawers now and
then I'm gonna take a shower and then
put this on again and maybe do a mask
but wait this sunset so pretty look
outside we have the best sunsets in
Bridgewater where I go to school I don't
know if it's gonna focus see
yeah it looks so pretty but I think I'm
gonna add off the vlog here and just
start like organizing my room and stuff
do some laundry cuz yeah maybe room is
kind of a mess and I also think I'm
gonna take some stuff out of my closet
and start posting it on my Poshmark so I
will leave a link to my partial mark
down below in this video for you guys
