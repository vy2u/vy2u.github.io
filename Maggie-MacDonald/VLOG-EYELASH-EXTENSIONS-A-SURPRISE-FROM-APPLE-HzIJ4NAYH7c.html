vlog today just because I don't know you
guys have been really liking my vlogs
and stuff so I just thought that I would
bring you around and show you everything
that I have to do today and I'm actually
gonna be doing like a ton of stuff
tonight and some really exciting things
actually so I just thought that it would
be fun to bring you guys along with me
my hair is literally a mess I slept with
it in a bun last night which I don't
know why I did that so I'm gonna go to
the gym right now I just have to get
dressed I am running a little bit later
than I thought it's around 10 o'clock
right now and I want to get my day
started a little bit earlier I have an
eyelash appointment that I'm gonna go to
you guys will see I'll tell you guys all
about where I got my wish is excited
about that so yeah
I'm wearing my new nmds to the gym today
but look at what I've already done to
them I don't know one time and they
already have like marks all over them
but I guess I can just wash them throw
them in the laundry and I'm gonna be
wearing my blue lines today I don't wear
this top when I work out I'm gonna pick
out a new top okay and you guys always
ask me where I get my sports bras for
working out and I always work out in
this type of one I have one in black and
then another one in like a gray color
but I get them from Lululemon they are
called the free to be bra with like the
longer thing on the bottom I have no
idea but you guys go in and ask for the
free to be bra but just like the one
that looks more like a crock tank top
we'll know exactly we were talking about
so I think I'm gonna wear this one today
with these pants and they're my shoes so
I didn't want to bring my camera to the
gym today
just because I am like kind of in a rush
I won't just like get after the workout
but I just thought that I would tell you
guys what I'm gonna be doing before I go
and I'm just gonna walk on the treadmill
for like 45 minutes and then in
line of 9.0 and the speed 3.5 or 3.6 or
2.7 however I'm feeling so I'm gonna go
do that right now come home and try to
film a few videos and stuff before I
have all the errands I have to run so I
would check my kidney through guys a
little bit later I just gotta have a gym
I really didn't want to workout this
morning honestly I was like so like in a
haze I just had a snow day for two days
in a row so I was like so unmotivated oh
sorry the gym last night and then I was
just like no you know what it's a snow
day I'm gonna take the day off like rest
chill out so I just went to the gym
right now my name really didn't want to
go at all but I was like you know what
I'm gonna go because I heard this saying
the only workout that you were gonna
regret is the one that you didn't do so
I was like you know what that sucked her
I'm gonna go to the gym I'm gonna work
out I'm gonna get after it because I
don't know and now like I feel so much
better and I like ready to like do
everything that I'm gonna do today
and guys I've been obsessed with you
burn through these vanilla bean
chopstick I usually I like the
strawberry one but I'm obsessed with
this one right now I just got my coffee
and I got its different flavor than the
one I normally get from Mary Lou's and
usually I get toasted almond but today I
got banana nut and it's so freakin good
I am so upset so that may lose coffee
you guys know I love it and if you don't
live in Massachusetts and you want to
try it you can order it online so if
you're obsessive iced coffee like I am
I'll leave a link to their website down
below so you can order it so balm
toasted almonds really good until it's
banana nut but I wanna clean my car so
bad because look how disgusting it is
because of the salt and everything my
car is just like dirty like the ground
is disgusting but I don't wanna get it
cleaned yet because like look at it
outside it's so gross so we'll see and
also I need to get more of these because
these are my absolute favorite and I
always have Yankee Candle thing in my
car
this one's coconut beach and I copied
Emma
because Emma's like okay each one and so
I got the Coconut Beach one because I
loved her so much
okay breakfast time I need before I like
do all my errands just I'm not really
like that hungry right now because I
just want to look at the time that I
can't even see cuz we lost power when we
were on spring break and my Cartman said
yeah it's 11:50 and I am not usually
hungry after I work out I don't know why
I'm not but that's just the way that it
is and so I know that I need to eat
something because I just don't know when
the next time I'll be able to eat is so
I'm gonna eat and then take shower I'm
just having Ezekiel bread you guys
already know that I eat this every
single day for breakfast and I honestly
don't get sick of it it makes me feel so
good and it keeps me full serving a long
time
and yeah so honestly if it ain't broke
then don't fix it that's why I just eat
the same thing every single day and I
keep my bread in the freezer and it's
like kind of hard to like take apart
sometimes but I talk to pieces of it I'm
gonna scramble up okay back in the car
time to go run some errands my hair is a
mess Wow let's get it I just got my
eyelashes in a wink and I'm the absolute
worst I didn't want it all but I have a
big whole fiasco to deal with right now
and I don't like don't even know where
to start but basically this is my
problem I have two phones and I need it
to get my life figure oh because this is
my new phone which I'll talk about later
I just got the iPhone eight plus I got
that today but this is my old phone my
iPhone 7 and all my stuff is on this
phone and this one has nothing on it so
I keep getting text messages and stuff
and I literally can't use it I can't go
on Instagram it'll have any apps and
this phone doesn't work so I have to go
to Apple right now and they have to
switch over everything which I backed it
up on iCloud before but I guess like my
Apple ID doesn't work because I got a
new phone number so I need to go right
now and get all this stuff switched over
and figure out what I'm gonna do for
that but look at Boston right now
there's so much snow everywhere but my
allergies look good on that note and if
you guys haven't seen like my
instruments already I got them done at
wink lash bar in Boston and Katherine
does them I will have olive wings
information down below and I also have a
code that you guys can use to get
discount on all of your services if you
want eyelash extensions as well she does
such a good job if they look so good
right now
so I'm gonna find the Apple Store and
get my phone situated get all that stuff
done and I need to pick out a new case
so you guys can help me do that I'm
really excited
I think this is the hardest decision
that I've made all day which case you
got but until I find another case that I
really like you guys know and love that
red one and that's when that Gretchen
has right here and that's one that emma
has so we have these three but I just
got the red because you guys know that I
love it so until I find another one that
I like I'm just gonna get that and then
I also picked up the air pods - I'm
finally home and I decided that I would
do a little haul for you guys to just
show you everything that I got today
this is my old phone right here so I
need to back up my old phone onto my new
phone but I got the iPhone 8 plus in the
rose gold I thought that it was gonna be
like a normal regular gold but it wasn't
it was kind of more of a rose gold which
I'm totally fine with I didn't really
care that much I just didn't want black
and I've got a red apple silicone case
just like my one red one right here I
wanted it like baby blue or something
different than red I'm kind of over the
red it reminds me of winter I want
something different but I love this I
just didn't want it to break because it
is glass so maybe y'all look into
getting like a clear case or something
or try to look to see if they have any
cute ones online just because I've had
the red one for so long that I want to
branch out and get something different
so this is what the phone looks like it
is just the bigger size and then my
Lakshmi is me and Kaylee because I lost
all my pictures and that's the only
moment that I had I don't know I kind of
think it looks cute but that's what it
looks like and at the ATG store they
gave me a free pop socket so I picked up
this old donut one because I kind of
thought it was cute and then also from
Apple I got the air pods just because
I've been wearing my wireless beats a
lot lately and I feel like they've just
been like getting tangled in my hair
it's a little strap that they come with
it's been really annoying me so I was
like you know what everybody raves about
the air pods I'm gonna try them I'm
always traveling and doing it on this
stuff so for me to be able to just wear
and have them be really small
inconvenient in little and fit into my
ears perfectly thought be really helpful
because I hate being on a plane and
having that big long strap from the
wireless beats so I'm excited about it
got those I can't wait to try them and
then in this big bag right here Yankee
Candle was having a huge sale and I'm
obsessed with the car thingies from
Yankee Candle and these ones were only
dollar usually I got the card jars but
those ones like five bucks and I was
like you know what these ones smell just
as good so I got Bahama Breeze which is
really really good Tyler has that kind
in his car pink sands always a favorite
and then I got three of the coconut
beach ones like I showed you guys
earlier that ones in my car right now
that's one that Emma uses it smells so
good then in the bottom of the bag I
just got these little jars that you can
put in your room and I have these all
over my apartment and my favorite one is
a vanilla cupcake so I got three of
these because they were buy three get
three free so I got three vanilla
cupcakes just because I know that I
already like to have those ones in my
bedroom and I ran out of mine actually
so it's good that they were on sale and
then I also got three like fun different
flavors from my bathroom because I don't
know I just kind of like when my bedroom
has the vanilla cupcake scent cuz it's
more like homey and cozy and then in my
bathroom I like to have something like
yummy and fruity so I got this one and
its new and it's just called juicy
citrus and sea salt which made me think
it kind of smells like a margarita but
they just obviously couldn't write like
margaritas Henton at Yankee Candle but
it kind of makes sense citrus and sea
salt it smells really fruity and yummy
like a vacation and this one is also new
and it's called peaches and cream that
one smells so good and then this one was
just another coconut beach so I'm gonna
put these away and put a new one of
these out in my room to get rid of all
of this trash on my bed
so unnecessary bye Felicia
or okay I need to throw that away I can
throw that away and you just set up my
phone unpack all this stuff figure out
what you do for dinner because it is 553
so I'll check back in with you guys and
I am all finished I'm going to grab a
kombucha um actually I should drink more
water too
I'll grab a water and then I don't know
if I should have crying cleanse or
ginger lemon but these are my favorite
kombucha ever they are the healthy
kombucha and I'm gonna have an off
ginger lemon today and while that is
backing up on my computer I'm gonna do
some work at my desktop just because I
rarely use it and I don't know I just
feel like I need to start using it more
I just wanted to tell you guys something
really really exciting I booked a trip
well I didn't book it Gretchen did but
I'm going away next week for a little
few days getaway with Gretchen and Emma
we are going to Miami back to Miami
where I was last week I don't know where
we're gonna be staying at I think we're
gonna be singing in Airbnb we just
haven't found the right one yet that we
want to stay at but I'm gonna be going
back to Miami with Gretchen and I'm and
I'm so excited I loved Miami and I
cannot wait to do more things with them
well we're there I'm gonna definitely go
back to what dark cafe and get an acai

obsessed with it we're gonna go to the

excited I'm so excited for everything
that I have up and coming in these next
few months you guys are gonna love it
okay I just wanted to end off the vlog
just because
I've literally had the longest day ever
and I don't know like what happened to
the time or where like the day went but
it's 10 o'clock at night and go to bed
because I've crossed at 8 o'clock and I
always makes a mistake staying up way to
8:00 on a school night which I know I'm
gonna do tonight just because like I'm
gonna stay up and watch YouTube videos I
already know it but I'm just gonna take
some of my toner the fresh floral rose
toner and wipe my face I can't get my
face wet because I just got my eyelashes
to be done today so I'm just gonna use
some toner to like get all the like oils
and like stuff off my face so I usually
don't do this that much anymore because
I haven't really been breaking out
lately but today I am and off you can
see like on my forehead and like down
here well that's not anything these are
just like scars but I'm breaking out
really bad on my forehead so I'm gonna
use some of my Mario Badescu drying
lotion you guys probably like already
know what this is a lot of people use it
and it works really really well you're
supposed to just dip it down all the way
to the bottom where all of the pink
stuff is and then just take it right out
and then put it on the spots where
you're breaking out now I'm ready for
bed I'm not laying bed watch some
YouTube videos and then probably get to
bed really early just because I have to
get up super early maybe wait I actually
have a quiz let's do I think it's due on
Saturday so I'm going to do that now
