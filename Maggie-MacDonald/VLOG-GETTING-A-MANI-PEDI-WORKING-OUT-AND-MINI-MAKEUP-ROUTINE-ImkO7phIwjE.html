little bit after 11:00 and on Monday
Wednesday Friday I have three classes so
I have an 8:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. and at
10:00 10:00 so I just got out of all my
classes came home got in the shower
really quick my hair is like disgusting
right now cuz I didn't wash it yesterday
and then I want to wash it after I
workout today so I was like you know
what I'm not gonna wash it right now I'm
just gonna wash my body off because I
put a little bit of self tanner on I
don't know if you can tell like how tan
I am but I put some self-tanner on last
night and so I just got out of the
shower like clean to my face and
everything and I had something I was
gonna tell you but I forget but I'm
gonna put on some of my favorite but I'm
gonna put on some of my favorite
Brazilian crush perfume spray right now
just cuz it smells so good and then I
have a lot of stuff that I'm gonna do
today so I just want to bring you guys
along with me and do like a little vlog
because I know you guys have been really
like enjoying these walks that I've been
doing so outfit of the day just want to
show you guys really quick before
anything because I know I feel like I'm
gonna get some questions about like
where my sweatpants are from a lot of
people seem to ask me they're just these
gray brandy melville sweatpants and this
shirt says oh baby it's just a graphic
tee from forever 21 so I'm gonna wear
this and then I'm gonna wear it with my
adidas slides just because I'm gonna get
a pedicure today and look at it outside
your heads are gonna bake Maggie you're
crazy it's snowing but I don't think
it's sticking that much because I see
the roads and the roads are we can't see
through the trees right now but the
roads are like normal and it looks like
it's just falling and melting but it's
sticking on the trees and it kind of
looks pretty but it's April 2nd and I'm
over it so bye
they see me down here but okay so now
I'm gonna make breakfast and clean out
my dishwasher I was literally about to
say brekkie because I wash semi Robinson
so much that I'm feel like I'm starting
to like pick up on things that she says
since she's Australian but I need to
clean out my dishwasher really quick and
then it started making breakfast
I don't know why my camera won't focus
but as you guys can see I'm just having
a little spinach and egg omelette with
two pieces of cinnamon reason is he keel
bread so I'm gonna go ahead and eat this
and then start doing all of my errands
so I sold these two things on Poshmark
this Michael bikini right here and then
this sports bra from forever 21 so I'm
just gonna go ahead and like fold these
up and get them all packaged up little
bags and then I have to go all the way
to campus and print the shipping label
because my printer ran out of ink so I'm
waiting for that to come in the mail
which should be you know very shortly
it's also my wife I bent down like for
almost a week I think and so I am
waiting for that to get turned back on
so I can finally be like uploading
videos and stuff from my apartment and
not have to go all the way to campus
which is kind of a pain but whatever and
carry anything to my car I'm just
bringing my computer and all my stuff in
place and now the saddest part of this
whole entire day is the fact that I have
to put this huge jacket on because it's
snowing and I really don't want to uh
I'm like dreading going outside this is
really sad that I have to wear this
jacket oh god I don't want to go outside
right now people are gonna be like why
are you wearing those on her feet when
it's snowing my backpack like doesn't
even fit with this jacket right now
about whatever
and I need to try to get some of the
snow off of my car before I leave and I
didn't know what to use I'm gonna use it
for uh I just am leaving the post office
right now and this oh thank you this
parking lot or the post offices in my
town is so like not thought out and it
literally is like you can't even back
out because like you're on the street
I don't know it's the weirdest thing
ever so I'm like kind of trying to like
skirt out of my spot before anybody
comes but I haven't gotten coffee yet
today which is a problem because I can
eat it so bad hi I'm one second
um could I get a medium iced vanilla
hazelnut black I've got my Nellie's
because that's what candy gets
it's really really good so might as well
try something different today
it was K Lee's friend from high school
well this is good I'm working at Mary
Lou's today and she's so cute and nice
and she's always working there like
whenever I go to the one that he's like
a drive up or drive through and been so
funny one time I went to get my coffee
I'm gonna fix this a little bit one time
I went to get my coffee and she was like
oh my god I thought you were Kayleigh
and it was so funny because everyone
says that we look like this is the color
that I have on my nails right now you
can't really see it anymore cuz it's
like really coming off but it's this OPI
color called the Suzie without a paddle
but I really liked it obviously it's
like coming off and he looks for the
ugly
so I just got home and I'm really happy
with the way that my nails came out and
again it's just let's be friends and
it's like the OPI what's it called
Hello Kitty line and then these are my
toes and they're just like this fuchsia
pink color which is really different
I've ever gotten anything that before
but right now it's 335 I have to go pick
up Tyler at the airport he lands at like
6 o'clock so I'm just gonna go ahead and
do like a quick workout right now at the
gym but I'm gonna wear these Lululemon
pants that I haven't really worn in a
very long time just because I'm doing
legs today and I'll show you guys like
what workout I'm gonna be doing I'll
bring you with me and I didn't want them
to like fall down because when I wear
lines they always fall down so I'm gonna
get some socks and sneakers and then
change my shirt and head out
ready for the gym I'm just wearing my
pretty little thing cropped sweatshirt
Lululemon's and then my white nmds I
really need to get a good sweat in today
because I'm on my period and I really
didn't want to work out because I'm like
so tired and I don't feel good today
but I am on like a gym grind right now
just because I've been feeling like I've
been so busy lately and not like been
able to focus on myself and so now I'm
just like really focusing on myself
putting my house in like fitness and
wellness kind of like before anything
else right now just because I know like
that that's been like an area in my life
where I feel like I've been lacking and
I've just been like putting it on the
back burner and like eating whatever I
want and like not working out as much
and I can definitely feel it and I don't
know so that's just like what's going on
in my life so personally I just want to
like get back on track and it's Monday
so I want to start off the week on a
good note like do a little workout and
stuff and yeah so I will bring you guys
along with me and I hope that you guys
enjoy
last time I saw you guys I was at the
gym and my camera actually died so now
I'm home and I only have a few minutes
before I'm gonna go pick up Tyler and
the airport but I'm like really bored
and I um
what's it called organize my makeup
drawer like I told you guys I was going
to do in my last vlog but basically I
just put all of like my lip products and
my NYX in this container right here and
then this one just has a bunch of like
highlighters and like lip liners
eyeliners concealers stuff like that
bronzers my brushes are right here and
then a bunch of palettes and like bigger
things over here and then like my
foundations and primers are in the
corner and I kind of want to try out my
naked foundation and my Too Faced primer
just because I haven't wanted makeup on
my face in so long and I like I want to
put a little bit on and I don't know
what to do because I don't know if I
should so yeah I was thinking of just
like putting a teeny tiny bit on my face
right now
like seen how it looks I'm gonna use
this Beauty Blender right here and it
got all weird because I used it for
self-tanner once but it's actually not
dirty because I only use it once so I
think I'm gonna put a little bit of this
foundation on in this primer and then
maybe a little bit of concealer but I
don't know which one to use because I
have this concealer that was Maybelline
I think I wanted so or maybe it was
L'Oreal I don't really know which one it
was but I wanted to use that one too
but I've already so I don't know if I
have any concealer I may just have to
use the Fenty concealer and then maybe a
little bit of bronzer I don't know what
to do I'm just gonna set up my camera on
the edge of my desk I don't feel like
getting all fancy so I'm gonna take the
Too Faced hangover primer put a little
bit on my hands I used to love this one
like freshman year of college so it
smells so good it smells like coconut
milk
so I'm gonna put a little bit of that on
my face and now going in with my naked
skin by Urban Decay foundation in the
shade 4.5 I don't know if I used to put
it on directly on my face or if I did it
on my Beauty Blender I'm just gonna try
to like squeeze a little bit on oh my
god this is so lightweight I remember I
used to wear this like way way way back
this was one of my first foundations
that I ever tried because I like never
used to wear our foundation I would only
wear powder like bronzer and blush and
then I discovered foundation the end of
my freshman year I think it was the end
of my freshman year of college or maybe
it was the beginning of my sophomore
year I don't really remember but it was
like recently not recently but was in
the past like two years two and a half
years and yeah so this is like the one
that I used to use that's so funny
I really like it honestly I feel like I
have nothing on my face right now I'm
gonna have to use my Fendi for this one
because I really don't have any other
ones oh the feeling of it all my finger
is just like making me do not even want
to put it on I don't know why I don't
like it anymore
I feel like it can be kind of drying
so I'm going to take a little bit of the
setting powder
just say my face move it I'm also gonna
put on a teeny tiny bit of blush just
because I don't give my face a little
glow I totally forgot bronzer too so I'm
gonna have to bronze up I'm gonna use a
big fluffy brush for bronzer
Jessica's I'm not really gonna contour
anything I just kind of want to warm up
my face I'm gonna do it in like that 3
motion to get my forehead my cheek bone
and jaw line I'm gonna go back over with
a little bit of blush just because I
feel like it came off when I was doing
and now finish off with some highlight I
should have used my milk highlighter but
whatever I'm no wait you just use this
one and my Cupid's bow and now with my
toka watermelon hand cream I just got
the other day it smells so good and I
need to start moisturizing my hands more
because I washed them like so much
during the day I feel like I need to
keep them moisturized just because
they've been feeling a little bit dry
lately my friend V always has moisturize
hands so B if you're watching this I
stole the idea from you okay so now I
have to go pick up Tyler from the
airport what time is it
yeah I really have to go so I'm gonna
end off the vlog here but I hope that
