joggers ever I love them they're so
comfortable and so soft so if you have a
soul psyche your soul cycle near you try

reblocking I'm like look smugly but yeah
this is it
and when I'm at school you guys know I

so much because I'm just obsessed with
ice cream this is legit this videos
literally of what I eat in a day - my
breakfast because obviously for
breakfast I had to do scrambled eggs
with spinach and two pieces of Ezekiel
bread but I've showed you guys what I've

cuz that's his favorite I just got out
of the shower and so now I'm gonna do
one of Emma's little face masks and I
was like such cool stuff in her little
whatever this thing is called a beauty
mirror I think I have no idea but I
really want to use one of these masks
and she said that okay I think this is
the one that she was talking about it's
like a peel mask and I guess it's
supposed to like clear out your pores so
I'm gonna do this one right now like put
it all over my face okay so the face
mask is on finally and it feels really
good so far but I literally feel like
Gretchen today so Gretchen if you're
watching this I feel like you because I
dropped my camera down the brick steps
in my front yard and then I also just
put it down to put my mask on and look
what was spilling all over my camera
that's why there's only a little bit
unlike the toilet seat cover cuz I put
my camera down and literally all the
face mask stuff was like going all over
my camera so yeah I'm like ruining my
camera today and I feel like you like
when you went swimming with it in the
ocean
it's like dropped in the sand and stuff
but I'm gonna do this mask right now and
go like lay in are we gonna go segue in
my bed but like I don't have a bed here
at my house even though it's like my
house my bed is at school but I just got
a new bed that I'm gonna put at my house
like for this summer time just because
like this summer um I'm not gonna have
like a regular job like I normally would
have which I want to like go into detail
about because
ever since I was a freshman in high
school I've always worked a summer job
full-time like I worked at different
restaurants and like stores and stuff
but this summer I am just gonna focus on
YouTube and do YouTube all the time and
just like yeah basically just be
creating videos every single day like
putting content out there and like
enjoying myself and doing what I love
and I'm so excited to be able to do that
I'm so lucky and grateful and excited
and happy for this opportunity so yeah
my lips are really dry right now but
what I was gonna say was I'm gonna be
back and forth like between my apartment
at school my house here on the Cape
where I grew up if you guys didn't know
already I grew up on Cape Cod and then
I'm also going to be hanging out with
Tyler a lot and he doesn't live on the
Cape and then I'm gonna be with Kaylee
but also with my friends who were on the
Cape
so I already bouncing all over the place
it's gonna be really crazy but fun and
exciting and I don't know I'm just like
really happy and excited for
okay so usually I peel off of my mask
like on snapchat using my phone and I
like just look in like my camera in my
reflection and start peeling but I just
want to show you guys like how it's
coming off so it's all dry now like my
whole entire face I'm pretty sure before
I start peeling yeah so it's all dry and
as you can see I started to lift it up a
little bit at the bottom and with these
peel masks you're supposed to start at
the bottom by your chin and work your
way up so what I'm gonna do is just like
start grabbing
whoa so now it's like completely off I'm
just gonna go wash my face in the
bathroom and prep it to start getting
ready for bed I just got all ready for
bed like did my mask and everything in
my skincare routine and such and then I
realized I was like oh my god I left my
toothbrush at my apartment so I just had
to run to what the drugstore really
quick can pick up a toothbrush so I just
got like the CVS brand one just because
I don't know like nothing fancy I only
needed it for one night so I got that
and then I also got a bunch of my
favorite NYX lip glosses because I have
no self-control when it comes to going
to the drugstore comment down below if
you guys know the exact same way as me
because I feel like I'd go in for one
thing that literally cost a dollar and I
ended up spending $40 so please excuse
my nail right here I'm getting my nails
done tomorrow I started to pick my gel
off which is so bad and I'm really
trying not to do it so yeah but I wanted
to show you guys what colors I got so
this is the first one and it's just this
like red color and it's called Ibiza and
it's like Coralie almost like burnt
orange I'm really excited to test that
one out and then this one's more of like
a red ish pink the container looks more
pink than it is in person but this is
called I don't even know how to
pronounce that Addis Ababa so I got that
one and then I'm really excited to try
this one it's called Milan and then this
one's called Cannes and these ones are
kind of similar but I really liked these
like tones right here and then I also
got this one which is actually kind of
similar to both of them and it's called
and tour so I got all these and I'm
gonna test them out once I like do all
of my makeup and stuff just because I
just bought a ton of new makeup from a
Sephora like I showed you guys a lot
like a while earlier in this vlog so I'm
really excited to try these out and I
might do a video of like showing you
a bunch of different NYX lip colors and
stuff like that just because like I
don't know I feel like they're so
amazing and they're my favorite ones
ever like I swear by them and they're
only like five dollars so give this
video a thumbs up if you want to see it
something like that but I'm gonna get
ready for bed finally and this is all my
stuff on the ground in Emma's room like
all my stuff everywhere and it's such a
mess and like it's stressing me out so
I'm sure I'll leave it there and like
deal with in the morning oh my god if
you follow me on snapchat in the
Instagram you would have seen these
pictures how funny is that this is me
when I was a little holding Emma and
then that's me and I'm right there like
that's so cute these are the first
pictures we ever took together and so I
stole those I'm gonna bring him back to
school with me but before bed I'm gonna
put on this Lynne edge lip sleepy mask
I'm really really excited to use this it
says on the box that it's supposed to
like pull up your lips and hydrate them
and moisturize them so I'm really
excited to try that out while I'm
sleeping and I think that's it oh I also
picked this up today as well and it's
this body shop vitamin C peel mask I've
been like really into masks lately so I
got that and then I also got oh it's
right here this hand cream and it's by
the brand if it'll ever focus my
camera's like being really bad but it's
by the burn toca and they sell it at
Anthropologie they care they see it but
it's like a watermelon flavored hand
lotion it smells really really really
good so I got that and then this smells
so good I cannot wait to use it tomorrow
I was talking about that earlier so I'm
gonna go ahead put this on my lips and
finally start getting ready for bed I
just put the lip mask on and I'm like
actually obsessed with the way that it
looks on my lips and I wish it wasn't a
lip mask then I can only wear at night
I'm like I wish I could wear it on my
lips all the time but oh my god I'm
literally so tired I need
go to bed right now it's like 9 o'clock
and I I'm gonna get up in the morning
and go get my nails done actually I'm
not gonna tell you what I'm gonna do
tomorrow I'm just gonna show you in
