having like a chill day like I woke up
this morning and my voice was gone
so like how's the day got like has been
going on it's obviously been getting
better but I just feel like I don't know
I was gonna like film a bunch of stuff
today but now my voice is like this like
I can't so I'm gonna look over and a few
errands and stuff and bring you guys
along with me as always just a little
chill vlog but I'm super cozy today this
is my favorite tank top of all time you
would have seen it in one of my honey
boom hauls recently but I'm just wearing
this tank top with this little Calvin
Klein bra Brandie joggers and Adidas
slides and I actually just ordered new
pair of slides online so they'll be
coming in fairly shortly fairly short
they don't even know if I make sense but
they'll be coming in soon because I did
two-day shipping
I'm really excited about that because
they should like these ones are like a
little bit too like casual for if I want
to like wear a cute outfit I don't know
what like this is just like chill vibes
and I'm not getting sick of these so I
ordered new ones but yeah so I'll show
you guys those when they come in
obviously so I think I'm just gonna head
it to the grocery store right now I'm
super bored Kaylee's not here she's with
her boyfriend Derek and Tyler had his
like test this morning for like the
state police and because he wants to be
police officer so he had to like go all
the way up to New Hampshire today and do
like his fitness test and then like this
written test so he's gone and I'm
literally sitting here so bored Oh God
so I don't really know what to do but
since he like went home for the weekend
but not the weekend like the night he's
coming back to school like this
afternoon tonight and he's gonna bring
me back ice cream from this really good
ice cream place in this town so yeah I'm
really excited about that
ah but I just have been like doing
laundry and like having a chill day and
now I'm gonna
head it to the grocery store but I want
to use my bag just because I'm gonna
bring my camera and I don't have to hold
it so but I'm just gonna go to the
grocery store now I will bring you guys
along with me show you guys what I'm
gonna get because I literally don't have
anything in my fridge right now you'll
probably see that when I get back cause
I'll show you guys like what's in it and
I've really been trying to not record
I can't move for my face because someone
commented that I want to make video so
I'm being more mindful of doing that
yeah I got this new little car freshener
from inky Kendall and I'm using the pink
sands one right now and it smells so
good my car smells so fresh and clean
and all I need to do now is like get it
cleaned on the inside because since it's
starting to get nice out I want to like
get all the salt and stuff like cleaned
off just because I don't know I will my
car looking nice and fresh for spring I
still love the song so much I think back
in the day
my apartments so hard to pull out of oh
my god this is legit my favorite part
about coming to the grocery store this
right here
ah so I got so much at the grocery store
I just got some paper towels because our
little thing over there is empty and I
want to go to Target and get like a big
thing of them but I obviously might
caught my like tire things all messed up
so I don't want drive really far on it
and then I got this Greek salad because
I got one last night it was really
really good so I just got that again for
tonight because I don't feel like
cooking and then I also got a few
bananas and then just like a bunch of
fruit on the bottom here I was like in a
fruit vibe so I got some cantaloupe some
pineapple apples cottage cheese and then
in here I just got some pita bread
because I'm gonna eat the pita bread
with my Greek salad
then I got some eggs cuz you guys know
that I always eat eggs in the morning
and then I have baby carrots some mango
and strawberry some spinach and then
just some organic humus so I'm gonna put
all this stuff away and it's like almost
five o'clock and I'm kind of hungry so I
don't over me my salad right now or I'll
just have some fruit in carrots but we
will see this salad was my favorite
right now and you can never go wrong
with a Greek salad I feel like and now
that it's getting warmer out I want to
start eating more like fruits and
vegetables just because I feel like when
it's so cold and wintery out I like
don't eat as healthy I don't know I
always want like pasta and bread and
like warm things but now I'm gonna start
like eating a little bit better and just
like more fresh like fruits and
vegetables and stuff I don't know why I
just like put the camera in the mirror
like that I'm sorry but um I wanted to
update you guys on my little
dermatologist appointment thingy because
I've been recording there like vlogging
a couple days but I don't know like what
I'm gonna do with the footage I have no
idea I haven't even looked at it yet
well
to see if it's even like good but
basically I talked about it in one of
the vlogs
um my face was breaking out really bad
right here and on my forehead and on my
chin I don't know why I was just getting
like the most random breakouts and I've
like never broken out like that before
ever so I went to the dermatologist and
my dermatologist prescribed me some
medicine just to like put on twice a day
one of them you put on choice a day one
of them you do at a time like before bed
so that's what I'm using on my face and
it's kind of like gotten a little bit
more clear so I'm just doing that I'm
still washing my face with my CD foam
gentle skin cleanser but now I feel like
I like can't use any of the products
that I used before like I'm just being
very careful with what I put on my face
just because of right now until this
stuff's cleared up I want to like get to
the bottom of it and like make sure that
it's nothing that like I was using
before so this is just what I'm using
right now in my face morning and night
some Dickinson's witch hazel it's just
like the original one you can get at the
drugstore you can probably get on Amazon
really anywhere but I'm gonna go and
order some new like skincare products
just because I don't think what I was
using before was agreeing with my face I
honestly think that it was my fresh rose
floral toner because before I started
using that my skin was fine and like I
look back and watching my old vlogs and
I see that like before I use it my skin
was completely clear and then once they
started using it I could slowly see this
not developing even though like I didn't
realize it because it was still like
underneath the skin it's not even on
this like surface of the skin sorry like
be close if I don't know if that's gross
but it's not even on like the surface
it's literally underneath and it hurts
my favorite really hurts right now too
and I can't speak I'm so sorry but I
don't know
I am I - a face mask honestly
and I wanted to go on my desktop but my
keyboards dying so I'm going to really
plug it in but whatever I'm going to eat
my salad chicken chill and start
planning stuff for the week because I
leave on to Thursday morning for
Coachella I'm wicked excited so question
I haven't really early flight
hi guys so I've logged yesterday and
then I ended up not like finishing off
the video just because I like had a ton
of homework to do and this is like my
crunch week where I have feel like I had
literally everything do in my classes
all at once and so like I'm super
stressed out about it
and yeah I don't know but I was talking
to you guys about my face yesterday and
now I'm like breaking out again today
like yesterday I feel like it looked a
lot better and then last night I ate ice
cream and then I woke up and it was like
getting read again and I don't know if
it's because of like the dairy I'm gonna
try to like try to cut out dairy out of
my diet just because a lot of you guys
have been commenting on my video and
they're like and you guys are like maybe
it's the dairy and like there could be
so many different reasons why my face is
doing this I really don't know so I'm
gonna try to do that just to see like if
it helps yeah oh but if all honestly
could be stress as well but I don't
really know yet and I just got back from
class I had three classes this morning I
had one at 8 9 and 10
and yeah so I think I'm gonna go like
workout soon that's why I'm wearing like
my leggings and sneakers but I just went
for like a little hike after class weird
sounds like really funny but Tyler had
like this project thing do in one of his
classes it was actually a hiking class
so we have to like go like hike this
trail I'd like to take a picture of
something like interesting so I just
went with him for that but yeah I just
want to like talk to you guys about a
few things today and update you on my
life and stuff like that where's my
water I need to eat something else cuz I
just had a little bit of fruit this
morning but I'm getting kind of hungry
right now and I'm also gonna take my
vitamins just gonna forgot to do that
before the hike and I know I was talking
about these vitamins in my last vlog
where I was talking about my skin but
these are just the care of vitamins and
mine came in the mail like the ones that
I had ordered and I don't know I just
want to show them to you guys because
they're so cool as you can see on the
packaging it just says your name like
everything's personalized like I show
you guys when you take the quiz to see
which item ins you should take and then
they come in the mail in this box and
then if you open this up all them are
like inside and they're just these
little packets super easy to like pull
out I just leave mine on my counter next
to my speaker just because when I make
breakfast every single morning it's just
so easy to grab one but basically this
is what the packaging looks like mine
just says my name on it and then it also
came for this came with this little book
that just says made for Maggie on it and
it tells you about everything that is
inside like I have my vitamin D pill
that's supposed to help with my skin and
then I have a digestive enzyme which is
supposed to help my bloating and then a
probiotic blend which is gonna just help
like your stomach and have like help you
have a good gotten stuff like that so
I'm gonna go ahead and take these right
now and then probably have something
else little to eat just because I'm
going to be working out soon so I want
to like eat right now so when I work out
I don't think pass out or anything oh
but you guys can also use my code Maggie
for 25% off your first month of care of
vitamin and I just got these in the mail
the other day and honestly I really like
them like I haven't been bloated at all
like I don't know if you can like tell
my stomach is just really feels good
right now and I know like before when I
was taking my quiz to see it which
vitamins that I should take I had like a
really bad problem with bloating so
that's definitely helped me so much but
I just wanted to update you guys on like
a few things going on in my life one
second I'm gonna take these pills really
quick but I'll be right back
cool now that that's done I just want to
update you guys on a few things that
I've been doing recently
so I don't know where to start so a lot
of you guys have had questions about
like unanswered things that I've talked
about in like vlogs and I feel like
since I'm so open with you guys and I
basically record every single day that
like of my life and I show you guys so
much and tell you guys so much that I
feel like I should answer
these questions just because a lot of
you guys have been really confused
lately
and stuff like that so I just wanna like
clear everything up and I recently
posted two vlogs from when I went home
over the weekend and everyone was like
one question I got a ton was why is Emma
moving into the master bedroom at your
house and like asking where my room was
and all that stuff if you didn't know
I'm in college I'm 21 years old and I
live at my apartment with my roommate
Kaylee you guys would have seen her in
the Miami vlogs so I have a roommate I
live in my apartment I go to school I
don't live in my house anymore on Cape
Cod but Emma still lives there and she
lives there with my dad and my parents
just recently over the winter got
divorced so my mom doesn't live there
anymore so now my sister is moving into
my parents old room and my dad moved
downstairs into like this other room
that we have that my brother used to
live in like the master bedroom for like
downstairs if that makes any sense but
so my dad is living down there my
sister's living upstairs and then her
old room is going to be turned into like
a YouTube room slash like a beauty room
and all of that and when I go home
during the summers which I don't know
how much I'm gonna be going home but
when I do go home I will sleep in Emma's
bed with her because she has a king-size
bed so like whenever we go home anyway
like last summer I had my own room and I
didn't like my bed that I have in my
apartment right now right here is my
room
my bed from my room at home so I brought
it to school and even last summer like
when I lived there and I had this bed at
home I still slept in Emma's room every
single night like we just get along so
well and like she really is like my best
friend so we just like have sleepovers
and like I sleep in her bed and stuff
like that but if I don't like go home
I'll just be here at my apartment at
school so that's one thing I wanted to
update you guys on um I'm trying to
think of there if there was anything
else that you guys were like questioning
you know that there's been like so much
lately my skin thing has been like a big
one people have been like oh my garlic
off data so what the dermatologist said
and like all of that so that's another
thing that I just wanted to talk about
but yeah other than that I've just been
like really stressed
lately because it's at that point in the
semester where it's like getting towards
the end I only have three weeks of
school left so I have a ton of work all
in one week like I wish I could show you
my calendar I have so much stuff too and
I leave for Coachella on Thursday and so
it's good that I have a six-hour flight
because I have usa's I'm gonna work on
while I'm on the plane which Oh reminds
me another thing that I wanted to talk
about was I'm so busy with school right
now I just feel like I don't know I want
to start focusing more fun like my
videos and like content I'm putting
content that I'm putting out there and
like make it more about stuff that like
I'm passionate about and like why I
started YouTube and I feel like the
because I've been so busy with school of
kind of like lost track of that and I
just want to like get back on track and
start like making more fashion videos
and like working out and like eating
healthy and stuff like that just because
those are the things that I love and I
feel like when I'm at school and like
have all the schoolwork and have all
this stuff going on all at once I feel
like it can get kind of like
overwhelming and then I just end up
doing like a daily vlog and like showing
you what I do in the day which I love
doing that and I'm gonna keep doing that
because I know that you guys like them
but I'm also going to be doing more like
outfit videos and workout routines and
cooking videos and stuff like that just
because I'm gonna have so much more time
this summer that I'm gonna do that I
don't know I'm just like really excited
to start like doing that especially
because it's gonna get a nicer out and
I'm gonna be wearing like cuter outfits
other than just leggings and a tank top
because I don't know I just like love
being able to express my style when it's
like warmer out stuff like that I don't
know I think I'm gonna clean my room up
a little bit start packing my stuff for
Coachella and get all that set and I
need to clean up my room because I
literally have all of my like Lululemon
clothes here on my bed because I just
did all my I'm in laundry and I need to
do some other laundry just get my room
all organized and get back on track
maybe do some homework and I'm gonna go
to the gym but I just want to end off
the vlog here and I don't know like I've
just been like super stressed
like recently but I'm trying to get
outside and like walk around that's why
today I think it was really good for me
that I went on like that little hike
with Tyler because it just like helped
like get a lot of like stress out like
we just like walked outside and talked
like I didn't call my phone or anything
something that was really really nice
just to be able to like do something
like that and like kind of just
disconnect myself from the world which I
think everybody needs once in a while
just like a disconnection from social
media in all that and just like go
outside and like spend time with people
and like talk face-to-face and do that I
think that that's something that's
really important in life so yeah I'm
gonna end this vlog off here and in live
you guys so so so much thank you so much
for watching and thank you so much for
all the love and support that you guys
have been giving me lately
I just I can't thank you enough and I'm
very appreciative of it and I just don't
ever want you guys to think that I'm not
or anything like that like I don't take
any of this for granted I cannot believe
that I have like any of these
opportunities and I don't know I just
feel like I've been like really realized
I'm not realizing that all that lately
I've been like really grateful and stuff
so I'm gonna stop talking cuz now I've
been talking forever and I love you guys
so much and yeah that's all I have
I'll see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
