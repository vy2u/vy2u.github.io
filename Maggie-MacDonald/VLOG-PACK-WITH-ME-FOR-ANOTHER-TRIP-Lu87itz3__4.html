had a natural wave to it all the time
but I like it I wish I can wear my hair
in a bun every day Kaylee finally just
got home from Florida and now we're
getting our nails done come back but I
don't know what color to add I have this
one on right now and I really need to
get a new one huh
and we got a coffee okay
hi I'm just gonna get a gel manicure
what color to get
so this is the color that I thought and
it's called Susy without a paddle I
don't really know what that means but I
don't know I kind of like it
it'll definitely grow on me this smells
good it's like minty but look our nails
look like a boy baby in a girl baby
this is like the kylie jenner like
reveal she like posted oh that lady made
me bleed she drew blood she was hurting
me I know
oh that like I hate that she made me
bleed my hair mine has like you know
when you still kind of have like oh yeah
underneath I know when you still have
like stuff stuck yeah Gretchen just
texted me like a really cute text oh my
god she goes by am I so emotional haha
with three kisses and a red heart but
I'm stressed I need to pack for I need
to pack I haven't packed I'm going away
tomorrow but it's fine because you're
only going away for a couple t I know
but like what if it gets cancelled it
goes of the snow minded distract us to
Key West
I'm literally got cancelled that was I
know we just got home from getting our
nails on I don't know if you can really
hear because I'm cooking but I'm making
dinner right now and I don't even know
what time it is because I still up fix
my clocks at 5:40 so I'm making dinner
and I didn't really have that much food
just because I'm leaving for Miami
tomorrow you need a pack and yeah so I
used all the stuff that I had I'll show
you guys what I'm making I'm just gonna
be having some girls chicken and then
inside here I put some carrots and then
I'm gonna microwave a sweet potato which
is already in the microwave I need to
set this right now
and so my sweet potatoes and they're
cooking I have my carrots commit chicken
and what I used to cook my chicken is I
just put a little bit of the coconut oil
cooking spray in my pan and this is the
one that I use right here you just get
it from any grocery store so basically
it's dressed coconut oil and then I just
put it all over my pan and then put my
chicken on top and then just move it
over and like flip it as much as it
needs and I don't put it on too high the
heat I try to do it like the medium just
because I don't want it to burn but it's
gonna leave really crispy right now
my dinner is already now and usually
I'll just finish it off with some fresh
ground pepper put some of my carrots and
sweet potato and then also some pink
salt but I don't really know if I'm in
the mood for that right now
but I realized that I'm literally not
eating anything green which is so bad I
usually always try to have a green in
there and I'll do like less carrots and
then I'll do like half carrots and a
half broccoli or like green beans or
asparagus whatever I have that I
literally didn't have anything in my
fridge like this is all that I had like
I was saying because I want to eat all
my stuff before I go to Miami so I'm
gonna eat this and then start packing
packing for Miami once again I feel like
I was just doing this a week ago or just
unpacking all this stuff right here
but I think this time around I'm gonna
use my little mini suitcase just because
we're only going to be gone from
Wednesday to Saturday morning so this
one is just a Cal pack I really want to
get one of the marbled ones that they
have they're really really cool um but
this one's just plain grey and then you
guys know I also have this like rose
gold coppery like bronzy one so I'm
gonna go through all my stuff right now
and try to figure out what is gonna be
necessary for Miami maybe I think since
we're gonna be there for two full days
and three nights I'm gonna pack a few
night clothes also a few bathing suits
but I'm definitely not gonna try I'm
definitely gonna try to not over pack
just because you guys know that every
single time I go on a trip my bag is
always overweight I don't even know what
bikinis I'm gonna bring while we're
there but I know that we are doing a
special little surprise video that you
guys will see on my channel we're gonna
be filming it in Miami that's why we're
going to Miami just because we have a
video that we're gonna film for a brand
and obviously here in Boston it's really
really cold out it's actually gonna be a
blizzard tomorrow so we're freaking out
about our flights right now because they
might get changed
and or canceled so Gretchen is gonna
probably get them switched but oh and if
you didn't know before I'm going to
Florida with Gretchen Lucy and Emma and
we're doing some work for a brand and
yeah so that's all I'm gonna say just
because you guys are gonna see the video
on my channel and be like oh that's what
they were doing and you guys are gonna
be so excited for this video it's
something that I'd asked you guys if you
wanted to see and like last time I went
to Miami you guys are all freaking out
about this topic so you're gonna be
really good really really happy with I
like what it is and the way it's gonna
come out I'm so excited so I'm just
gonna use my little packing cubes that I
got for my last trip you guys know so
this one I'll probably put like
underwear and socks because I know we're
gonna go to SoulCycle and then this one
I'll probably put workout clothes and
bathing suits and then I'm gonna need
one of these big ones for like dresses
and nighttime clothes and like shorts
and stuff so maybe I'll use this one
right here and probably clean it out a
little bit
so I have all the bathing suits right
here that I'm gonna bring so I'm gonna
bring the pinks awful one just because I
feel like Emma will want to wear this
one or maybe even Gretchen I'm not gonna
wear it just because you guys know how
many pictures they already took in it in
Miami last time I went and then I'm
gonna bring this red one just because I
love it and I love the way it fits and I
wore it on the first day and I feel like
I only posted like one photo in it so
maybe I'll end up wearing that and maybe
someone also have a bathing suit that I
can wear and they can wear that one I'm
also bringing Molly J swim just a plain
white string bikini and then this
bathing suit right here also Molly swim
that I didn't get to wear to the beach
because it was raining that day so I'm
gonna bring those and then also a pair
of plain black bottoms just in case
anybody has a black top that I can wear
so I'm only gonna bring those with me
for this trip and this one's a full is a
full knowledge a swim Molly J swim and
this bottom right here is a full as well
I just got really stressed out so I made
a list of things that I'm gonna need so
basically we're gonna be there Wednesday
Thursday Friday and Saturday we're
coming home in the morning so I just
need to pack something for all these
days so I wrote a list down just so I
don't over pack and I got so many new
cute clothes from princess Polly you
guys already know that so I think I'm
gonna pack a few of those and yeah so I
will show you guys what I pack when I
get it all figured out
I think this is my final assortment of
like daytime clothes and nighttime
clothes I'm gonna pack this princess
Polly little t-shirt will be really cute
and also this little tank top with these
denim shorts from princess Polly so I'm
gonna pack these just in case if we go
do something in the morning like get
coffee or smoothie bowl whatever I'm
gonna pack those just for like chill
vibes and then this outfit right here I
need to get some pictures wearing this
so I think that this would be super cute
with just with these white shorts also
from fences Polly so those are separate
and then for nighttime outfits I was
thinking of packing this skirt right
here and also this
black top from princess Polly and then
I'm gonna bring this free people
bodysuit just because I don't know I've
never worn it before I got it from
revolve like a while ago and I might
wear it with the skirt or I might wear
the black top I don't know yet so that's
one of the nights second night I'm just
bringing this little blue dress right
here from princess Polly and then I have
a really really beautiful white dress
also from princess Polly and I brought a
lot of neutral items just because I only
want to bring one pair of shoes and
these are just the ones that I wore in
Miami last time and they are just from
Nordstrom playing like nude colored
heels with a little ankle strap so those
will go with everything that I'm
bringing which will be awesome I'm also
gonna be packing those items over there
and then I need some chill clothes and
eye clothes to wear on the plane so I
might bring these little SoulCycle
sweatpants that I have I'm not really
sure yet but I'm definitely gonna be
bringing these two t-shirts to sleep in
and I think I'm pretty much done in the
clothes area so I'm just gonna pack an
outfit to wear on the plane for the ride
home and also probably a pair of
sweatpants to wear while we're like in
the hotel and then I will be done
okay so this is the finished product of
all my stuff I'm really happy with the
way that everything is fitting so
basically I just have like regular
overts in here workout clothes comfy
clothes sleep clothes in here bathing
suits underwear socks in there a few
sweatshirts that I'm just gonna pack my
heels one pair and then my adidas eyes
which are like my everyday shoes and
then I only brought a little bit of
makeup in this little Sephora travel
case you guys can see just like my
favorite products that you would have
seen in my like beauty favorites video
my favorite lip products some bronzer
blush highlighter you get the gist these
are my favorite products to use in the
Sun I just usually Hawaiian Tropic
tanning oil some 30 sunscreen and then
also just a Neutrogena oil-free face
sunscreen just cuz I have eyelash
extensions so that's what I like to put
on my face and my face is really
sensitive so I don't like to put like
regular Sun tanning lotion on it and
then these are some sweat pants I'm
gonna wear tonight I have to pack that
in my bag my wallet I need to make sure
I have everything and I'm gonna use this
tote bag as my carry-on and then that is
just my suitcase some sneakers
toiletries and the computer lotion
jewelry stuff over there and then right
here are my ear pods they're just
charging I have to remember to bring
those and I will update you guys with
what is in my carry-on bag once I'm done
finished packing that I'm gonna put all
this stuff into my suitcase right now
so I just took a shower and I'm all
clean and ready for bed and like to do
all this stuff I have to do before I go
to bed but I just want to show you guys
I'm fully packed now I packed everything
in my suitcase and this is all the stuff
that I have to pack in there tomorrow
and I like to just put all of my big
items like my toiletries and stuff in
plastic bags so they don't get all over
my suitcase and then I just have some
swatches on my bed like I showed you all
this stuff my outfit I'm wearing
tomorrow a little bag for my stuff
tonight so that is basically everything
I'm gonna be packing and we actually
have to change our flight because it's
going to be really snowy tomorrow so we
had to change it from 450 to 1250 so now
I think I'm gonna have to skip class if
it doesn't get canceled and yeah so I'm
gonna end up the ball carrier hope that
you guys enjoyed this like a little
packing vlog I know that you guys really
liked my one last time that I did so I
