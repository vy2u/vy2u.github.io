vlogged in such a long time so I just
thought that today I would vlog a little
bit like catch you guys up on my life
like what I've been doing because I am
back at school now so I feel like I
don't have like that many exciting
things going on just because I go to
school in such a small town and like
there's really nothing to do so all I
really do is like hang out with my
friends and like go to class and stuff
like that so today is Sunday and I have
so much stuff to do and I'm like
cleaning my room and I'm going to
SoulCycle soon and what time is it right
now
2:13 I have class at 4:00 so I should
probably leave soon I wanted to go to
Sephora and try to get a serum for my
face cuz I don't know if you can see
it's just been like super super super
dry and it's because I ran out of my
serum so I haven't been like doing my
regular skincare routine that I have
been doing and it's like definitely
showing on my face it's like really
stressing me out so I gotta go get a
serum but I'm cleaning my room right now
and I got a ton of stuff this past week
at the mall and I was gonna do a haul
but I was like you know what like I
didn't really have the time and I was
like this stuff is so random that maybe
I'll just like show it in this vlog so
I'm gonna do a little mini haul for you
guys I got this bodysuit from forever 21
it's super cute and it's gonna look
really good on spring break with like
jean shorts which I'm gonna tell you
guys about my spring break in a sec but
I got this body suits super cheap you
guys know I love forever 21 it was
twelve bucks so that is amazing I just
got some plain white socks those are
boring oh this shirts so cupid it has a
hole in it it's just a plain cropped
like white t-shirt and I kind of had a
little knot in the front but it has a
hole and I'm really sad so maybe I'm
gonna try to like sew it it's somewhere
on the side and then I also got one of
these breasts that you guys know that I
love just like the seamless ones and
they fit so well especially for me
because I don't wear bras and my boobs
are really really small so I like
wearing these oh it's inside-out but I
just got the plain black one you guys
know I have a white one already I showed
it in the hall then I also got this red
sports bra top type thing and it's just
seamless again this was like six bucks
sighs medium/large just because it is
stretchy and I wanted it to fit more
like a top not a bra
so I sized up then I got these babies
right here I haven't won them yet but
I'm so obsessed with them look how dope
these are they're just these adidas like
jogger e-type pants and they're
high-waisted and they have like a little
drawstring and I got these from PacSun I
cannot wait to wear those those are so
cool and then I also got these that I
wore the other night with a pair of
booties and a cropped white tank top and
they looked so good and these are just
like the adidas
once I have the snaps on the side and
these are so so so so cool I love this
like vibe right now you guys know I love
athleisure so those two pieces are
definitely like a must for me right now
I just love like all Adidas everything
and then I also got these from forever
21 and they're like these shimmery
joggers with these stripes on the side I
don't know I thought that these would be
kind of cool because I'm going on spring
break in Miami and I don't know but they
kind of like look weird on so we'll see
if I will be able to like make it work I
know that they were only like 12 bucks
so that's what I got and I'm really
excited to be able to put that stuff
back away in my closet because it's been
sitting out for so long and I also got
this sweatshirt that I'm wearing right
now and it's just from soul cycle and it
has like this distressing like detailing
around the neck and it just has a little
one of those things called I'm like
drawing a blank right now skeleton like
this whole cycle logo thing and it's
just cropped and I don't know I think
it's super cute because I really never
know what like what to wear what I'm
going to class I like always just try to
throw on a crop sweatshirt but I just
like to this one cuz you guys know I
love crop sweatshirts and I liked the
white because it made me look tan and I
don't know I really liked it so if you
guys like have a SoulCycle near you I
know you can buy their stuff online I'll
try to have it linked down below for you
but I really like the way that it fits
and it's just super soft and really
really cute I just packed up all my
Poshmark order as well these are my sole
simple socks but all of these are going
to all of you guys who bought myself own
Poshmark and I always get questions on
why I sell stuff that I wore like once
or twice or never
been warned like this jacket right here
that I weren't the Superbowl I sold
because I already took so many photos in
it that I got sick of it and I'm always
like buying and like getting new stuff
so that's why I like to sell a lot of it
because I have limited closet space at
school and I already have so much stuff
that I literally don't wear and it's
like never-ending and I just don't have
the room for it honestly like that's
full that big bucket is way too full
like overflowing I like don't have
enough room for anything so that's why
I'm always like getting rid of stuff
because I really just have limited
closet space at school so I just wanted
to clear that up with you guys just
because it's not that I don't like this
stuff I just genuinely don't have the
room for it but thank you so much for
buying all my stuff from Poshmark
and these orders will be going out
tomorrow when the post office opens
again they wish it was open today
because this is literally taking up my
whole entire bed I'm sitting at my desk
now sorry you can't see my face my
tripod is in my drawer and I don't feel
like taking it out and setting my camera
because I'm about to leave for SoulCycle
but I just wanted to check a few things
for my spring break trip I'm gonna show
you guys where I'm staying because I'm
literally so excited so I'm going to
Miami with my roommate Kaley she's been
my best friend since freshman year like

in college and I don't think you guys
have like met her yet on the vlog um

need something cuz like the winter here
it's so so so like harsh outside but so
I got new Sierra I'll show you guys
which one I got when I get my car and I
just walked it to sweet Creek because I
thought it was open and the guy came out

Emma comes out tonight I miss her so
much I haven't seen her but I think I

I think I'm like a bunch I know she does
because I'm in which I've got a scream
from peaceful United know like all again
snapchat you see that it goes you some
others ice cream for all the time it's
okay I'm creating it because I haven't
had in so long now I'm thinking about it
so yeah I mean it look at this guy you
can't but I'm so tired I can't wait to
eat I for gonna say much about my car my
hair is literally so gross right now but
now that I'm back in the car I just
wanted to show you guys what serum I got
I don't know what to do with my hair
it's in like a really weird stage cuz
it's like wet and I'm sweaty and gross
but this is the little serum I got Oh
what did they give me what are these is
this an under eye cream oh my god is it
under eye cream I like really wanted to
try one hmm I'm excited I'm excited I
really wanted to try an under eye cream
Olivia Jade uses one all the time the
Kiehl's one and I am gonna end up
ordering it but I just want to try it
first and the serum I got was the only
Hendrickson truth brightening age
defying all-day hydration serum and it's
for all skin types as collagen boost it
has vitamin C all that good stuff and I
got the little mini travel size just
because it was only $15 so I was like
you know what if I don't like it then I
will at least have only bought the
little one rather than the bigger one so
I'm glad that I got this my skin really
really needs a serum in guys it's so
important to use a serum ever since I
started using one I can tell my skin
like has changed so drastically this is
what it like you salve into it before I
use a serum you can see it's kind of
like dry and like patchy in some areas
and it's literally because I haven't
used the serum for one week
and ever since I started using a Ciera
my skin just feels so hydrating so much
more like rejuvenated and brightened so
I'm really excited that I got that now
I'm gonna order Thai food because like I
was saying before I was like you know
should I go to Whole Foods should I go
to sweet green and get like a salad or
something and then I was like no I am in
the mood for Thai food and I just did a
really hard school cycle class it was so
good and I want Thai food not so I'm
gonna get so I need a call my Thai food
is it serious
this always happens his lease is so busy
it's so good I swear someone likely to
my secret no
oh I'm so glad I'm gonna have to wait so
I finally got my Thai food and I eat it
and it was so good but I just took a
shower and I need to find my chopstick I
don't know where it is so I'm just gonna
have to use aqua for right now but I
just tried out the serum that I got and
it's so freakin amazing I wish I did
like a first impressions of me actually
putting it on my face because first of
all my face feels so soft right now and
second it literally smells like citrus
like I can smell the orange in it from
like the vitamin C part and it smells so
good so I have a feeling that I'm gonna
end up buying the full-size of that um
just because it's so so so amazing and
now I need to moisturize my face I
really want to get one of their
moisturizers to currently impose but
it's black and resin and right now we
just got ice cream there's like a weird
glare on my forehead but I forgot my
vlogging camera when we got ice cream so

of our ice cream here and you should
pack oh this way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
