woke up and what time is it right now

thought it would just be fun to do like
a day in my life at college video show
you guys everything I'm doing today so
right now I am up so early is I am going
to the gym so I need to look at ready to
go right now in before oh I just wanted
to get a little snack and one of these
little rx bars that came in my Pinscher
box if you guys don't know what this is
they are just these subscription boxes
that are completely free and they're so
cool because it comes with a bunch of
different like beauty products and
different snacks to try out so you guys
should totally check it out I'll leave a
link for you guys down below but yeah
this is mine and it just had like these
little shampoo conditioners some
toothpaste some of this Olay whip
moisturizer and then some little rx bars
and other little snack so I think I'm
going to eat one of these then we're
gonna work out and then I have plus
eight o'clock so yeah I hope that you
guys enjoy so this is what I'm gonna
wear to the gym just my grey champion
sweatshirt with these Lululemon Alliance
I like couldn't even speak because it's
so early and I'm so tired and then I
just have on my little Adidas and I'm DS
and I'm gonna go workout right now and
like I was saying before I just thought
that it would be interesting to like
show you guys what I do when it's a full
day at college like my daily routine and
stuff and show you guys and like bring
you guys along with me so hope you guys
enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up
if you liked it and would like to see
more of these and yeah I hope you enjoy
it's a literally still dark out
and
and I can't wait for it to get laid out
again I'm so
for this my apartment is like so hard to
back out of the spots like
that they have I literally have to do
like seven three-point turns super it
just got to the gym six o'clock and I
thought that I would just tell you guys
what I'm gonna do for my workout before
I go in just because I'm kind of like
limited on time and I can't really bring
my camera in and like have time to film
but all I'm gonna be doing is cardio I'm
gonna walk uphill on the treadmill at
the incline at 9.0 and the speed 3.6 and
I love doing that and I just like sweat
put my headphones in listen to music
watch youtube videos it's one of my
favorite workouts it's what personally
works best for me I love doing cardio
and probably gonna squeeze in a little
ab workout really quick too so I really
got to go after it and oh you guys are
probably wondering why I'm up this early
I don't normally wake up this early but
it is Monday morning and I'm going on
spring break on Friday I have so much
stuff to do this week that I wanted to
like just get up get after it work out
get it done and out of the way so later
today I can like work on all the stuff I
have to do and I'll have to worry about
it and I'm working out before my class
if class at 8 so I really got to go but
I will see you guys when I'm done with
my workout that literally just felt so
good to workout oh my god I'm sweating
so much so I just finished my workout
it's 658 I was thinking about getting a
coffee right now just because I have
class at 8 o'clock but honestly I feel
like I like drinking coffee like not
when I'm in classic once I'm already out
of class and like doing stuff during my
day I think I'd like to like get nice
coffee and it's like way more enjoyable
so if you guys know what I mean you
don't like getting coffee like right
before class that you'd want to wait
till like after you're done so you can
like go about your day and like do your
normal things and drink your coffee let
me know is that just me is that weird
cuz I'd rather like go jivin get a
coffee once I know I don't have anything
else to do for the day
but I'm so excited to be done with my
workout I have so much stuff to do today
and it felt so good just to get it done
because I feel like when I wait until
later in the day I'm always thinking
like I have to work out I have to work
out oh my god
and it like stresses me out so now that
I'm done I can literally get everything
done that I have to do today it feels so
good so if you guys can force yourself
to get up out of bed and get your
workout done early I really haven't
recommend it I might start doing this
now because like I'm already done with
it I only woke up an hour earlier than I
normally whatever this is what I'm gonna
have for breakfast it's literally my
favorite meal of the whole entire day
I'm just having a spinach and egg omelet
and I use two eggs and then I'm having
two pieces of cinnamon raisin Ezekiel
bread and I literally eat this every
single day for breakfast I don't know
how long I've been eating this honestly
I've had it every single day since like
the summer and then I used to always
make this together I'm sitting in my car
waiting to go to my class at 10:10 and I
just got a coffee
I just got a black toasted almond iced
coffee from Mary loose and it was so
funny I walked in and the girl literally
made my coffee and put it on the counter
and I was like standing there and she's
like oh you're all set and I was like
wait what and it's literally because I
go every single day and I get this
coffee so it was so fun you should I can
do my order right away and I didn't even
have to say anything but I have one more
class I just had one at 8:00 one at nine
and now another one and then finally get
on with my day I literally can't sit in
class it gives me anxiety I'm like so
excited to just go to class and get it
over with
I couldn't even sit through two classes
like I had to leave and go get a coffee
before my next one I am like so stressed
out like when I sit in class like I
don't know I like can't sit there I
don't know why like I don't know what it
is I usually can't do it but I have one
more so
hopefully I can make it through wish me
luck
I hate school and like I'm so thankful
and like grateful that I get to have an
education but like I literally hate
school so much I just got back from the
grocery store right after class I ended
up just going to the grocery store like
picking up some food and stuff because
it is Monday so I like to go grocery
shopping on Mondays just because like by
the end of the weekend I don't have
anything left in my fridge and I know
that you guys really like grocery haul
so I will show you guys everything that
I got so in the first bag of stuff that
I picked up I just got these Thomas
whole wheat bagel fins and these are so
good
if you put them in the toaster and they
get really really crispy and put some
peanut butter on them oh my god they're
literally amazing you have to try them
and then I just got the cinnamon raisin
Ezekiel bread and this is what I have
this morning and it's really good for
you it's just like a sprouted grain
bread type thing and then I also got
some coconut oil cooking spray for my
eggs I got a big cucumber I also got
this garden vegetable hummus I don't
usually eat hummus because I will
literally eat the whole thing at once
but I wanted it with carrot so I got
that and then I got this little thing of
mango and strawberries because I was in
the mood for it I got some eggs and then
I just got some dish soap right here and
then I also got this Paul Mitchell tea
tree shampoo just because my hair's been
feeling weird lately
because it is winter so I call a shampoo
and conditioner because I feel like it's
just gonna make my hair feel less like
dry and weird and I don't know I just
really really like the smell of it it
smells like mint so good but they are
kind of expensive like for this little
bottle it's $20 each so about that and
then I also got these Gillette Venus
little razor heads because that's the
razor I used and I needed some extra one
of those and this is what was in the
second bag I just got some granny smith
apples I also got baby carrots a thing
of broccoli some green grapes a couple
oranges and then some chicken
so that was mostly like all the fresh
produce that I got so I'm gonna put all
of this stuff away in the fridge
then I need to film a few videos so I'm
gonna like it after it's with that but
oh my God my outfit today is literally
so comfy I'm wearing these big huge
sweatpants and my uggs and I'm literally
so cozy I could wear this every single
day and like be so content I love this
right now
good morning I look so gross right now
I'm just wearing these sweatpants with
this forever21 cropped tank top that you
guys know I love I love their little
seamless cropped like take tops because
they're so cheap but anyway it's so nice
out today and I'm wearing my little uggs
like I don't know I'm just like feeling
this right now
and I'm about to go get a coffee with
Kaylee so I'm gonna get my sunglasses at
my phone my keys and I'm gonna get after
it I have so much stuff to do today in
preparation for spring break so I just
wanted to like be able to get everything
done today that I need to do have to
ship some Poshmark orders I have to post
so much on Poshmark organize my life try
to like get everything all situated and
I'm also gonna be hosting in town on
Poshmark so I will leave my link to my
Poshmark down below just because I have
so many clothes and I need to get rid of
some of them to make room for all the
new clothes that I got for spring break
so anyway I'm gonna go get a coffee and
yes so I will bring you guys along with
me oh my god it's so bright today but
you know what I've been literally loving
lately I've been loving aquaphor on my
lips I don't know why I just have this
big thing of it and it's just like feels
so good and it's so like hydrating and
moisturizing on my lips and I feel like
I'm gonna be using it a lot when I go to
Miami for spring break
just because I'm gonna be in the Sun so
much and I don't want to like dry out my
lips or anything but you can get that
literally anywhere like Amazon at the
drugstore wherever it's just a big thing
about before and it's so so so good
but I need to go pick up Kaylee from her
boyfriend's house right now she stayed
the night over there and she forgot that
she didn't drive her car he picked her
up so we were gonna get coffees this
morning and meet at our apartment and
she was just like oh my god can you come
pick me up because I literally forgot
that I didn't drive whoa it's now
nighttime and all I've done my eyes like
itchy but it's hard to itch it because I
have eyelash extensions but what was I
she was saying oh I forget the last time
I've logged and what I was doing but I
went to the gym wait my camera's dirty
whoa that's so much better
um but I went to the gym I what else
would I do what I do today I drove her
home with Kaylee came home tried on all
my new bathing suits or spring break
talked chilled went to the grocery store
with Tyler got home made dinner
if you didn't see what I had for dinner
myself show you totally add me on
snapchat it's just that Mac McDonald to
put it I'll put a picture like right
here of what I have for dinner it was
bomb and now I'm getting ready to go
hang out with Tyler but first I just
want to show you guys my new bathing
suits for spring break just because I
was cleaning up my room so I have to put
these all away but I think I'm gonna
return these just because the bottoms of
them are super like not as cheeky as I
like so I think I'm going to end up
returning those but I really like the
top that came with the bathing suits and
they're just all from Billabong and it's
this is just a plain black top but I
don't know if you didn't see it but it
has like this really nice RIPTA material
so I loved that but the bottoms were
really freaky I got the same thing in
this blush pink color looks awful on me
I'm Way too pale for that I'm gonna
return that oh these bottoms were kind
of cute but this is a little bit thick
right here to go with that same ribbed
top
but I don't know I just don't know if I
was really feeling it and this one's
really cute except for the bottoms are
super thick on the sides also which I
didn't really like so I think I might
end up returning that and then it came
with this top which was alright it was
kind of like weirdly fitted on me so I
don't know if I'm gonna keep any of
those I think I'm just gonna bring them
with me on my trip just to see like if I
like them when I'm there and the moment
and I'm tan then I also got this really
really cute dress from ASOS ASOS
whatever you call it and it's just
completely sheer and has this little
waistband right here and I got this on
dode if you guys want to follow me on
