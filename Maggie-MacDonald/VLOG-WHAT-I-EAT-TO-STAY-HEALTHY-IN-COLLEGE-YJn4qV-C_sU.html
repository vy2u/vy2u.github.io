I was gonna do like a how I stay healthy
in college video and kind of like go
over what I eat and like what snacks I
carry in my apartment and everything
like that this isn't gonna be a typical
way to eat in a day video I'll do
another one if you guys want to see that
but I just thought that I would show you
how I say healthy what I do what I eat
what I carry in my fridge well I just
want to say before sending this video
that it is sponsored by hellofresh and I
wanted to do this video more as a blog
style because I don't know I just feel
like setting up my camera and doing like
the whole voiceover things just not my
vibe I'd rather just go through like one
on one like I'm talking to you guys like
as a best friend and show you everything
that I eat and all of that so if you
guys want to see it like how I stay
healthy in college just keep on watching
this video and without further ado let's
get started this is my kitchen at my
apartment this is my fridge and I'm
gonna show you guys what I typically
keep inside of it and up at the top here
I just have my hello fresh meals and
these are where I put them when they
come in the mound a little bit about
hello fresh it is a delivery service
that delivers prepackaged meals right to
your door and they're so convenient they
come in these little brown bags like I'm
showing you right now and inside they
just have all the prepackaged
ingredients and they're all measured out
exactly to the right amounts that you
need to make your meal and I love them
because it's so much more convenient
just to take out the bag out of my
fridge and have everything already like
prepackaged and all and everything all
measured out for me so I think that
that's so convenient and easy and
honestly it's so exciting to be able to
get a new meal every single week and
then cook it and just have a variety of
different things cuz for me I go to the
grocery store and I take so much time
trying to get all these ingredients to
make all these different things and I
end up getting overwhelmed and bored by
how much stuff I buy and how much
actually ends up going to waste and the
hellofresh meals come in a variety of
different like kinds and they have a
classic veggie and a family sized one
and I
just got the veggie ones this week and I
love using Helen first because it's so
quick to make it takes like 30 minutes
for the whole entire process because
honestly who wants to be in the kitchen
for hours cutting things up and
measuring it out and cooking and
prepping it all of that it just takes so
long and if you guys want to try out
hellofresh - i will leave a link to
their website down below and you guys
can use my code maggie and 30 for 30
dollars off of your first week of
hellofresh
and so that is just where I keep all of
my hello fresh meals up here and then
also in my fridge I have a little Thomas
English muffin pack I put it in the
fridge just because I didn't want it to
go bad but I like eating these light 100
calorie multigrain English muffins with
like peanut butter and banana on top in
the morning if I don't want to cook eggs
and I'm just in a rush and then down
here on the second shelf I just have
these planes Chobani Greek yogurts and
these are just the zero like nonfat
whatever you call these I like getting
the plain ones rather than the ones that
already have the fruit in them because
that's just added sugars that I don't
really need so I'd rather just cut up my
own fruit and put them in my own yogurt
then I haven't thing of eggs because I
like to cook eggs with spinach every
single morning and then these are just
some cut-up cucumbers for a snack I
really really like snacking on these so
I just have those all cut up and then
back here I just have some cottage
cheese and I have really been loving
those lately
on a English muffin it tastes so good I
don't know why and my roommate Amanda
used to always eat cottage cheese on top
of an English muffin so I was like I'm
gonna get that too because I used to eat
it with her freshman year and it was so
good and then down here that's just my
roommate Haley's spinach and a few
apples and this drawer is mine right
here and this is just where I keep all
of like my fresh ingredients in my
fridge I just have a box of Olivia's
organic baby spinach and then I also
have some baby carrots right here those
are also great to snack on I have some
green apples these are my favorite right
now I usually get red apples or green
apples like whatever mood I'm in but
this week I was in the mood for green
apples so I just got those
and then I have a tomato right there
which I don't think should be in the
fridge this is empty I can throw it away
and then right here I also just have an
orange and then in the door right here I
just have some Teddy smooth unsalted
natural peanut butter to put on English
muffins and things like that and then
over here I just usually keep out all
the fruit that I like need to keep on
the counter which is just one banana and
going into my cabinet let me see what I
have in here I have some coffee up at
the top for when it's warmer out and I
want to make my own iced coffee but for
now I have just been going and buying it
which I know I shouldn't because it
literally cost three dollars every
single time when I have every flavor
that I like up here at the top but I
don't know there's just something about
going and buying coffee at the place and
getting it in a cup with a straw
that's just so satisfying and then right
here on the next shelf I just have some
boom chicka pop there sea salt popcorn
and I got the little individual bags
because I feel like I end up eating so
much more when I have the big bag and so
I really just wanted to like control my
portions so I got the little bag and
then I just have some almonds right here
I think these are just the roasted
salted almonds yeah from Trader Joe's
those are really nice to always have in
case like you want a little handful then
before I work out then I have some
balsamic vinegar which I put on top of
salads I don't like salad dressing so I
have this what is this right here oh now
I just have some banana bread mix from
Trader Joe's I've had this in here for
like a few months I really need to like
make it or throw it away I don't think
it goes bad but I really definitely need
to like do something about that and then
down here I just have some trader droves
coconut oil I use this for cooking I
usually use the coconut oil spray but it
actually ran out of it so I've just been
using a little bit of that when I cook
my eggs and then I have some cinnamon
for my Greek yogurt then over here I
just have two different types of tea
this one is a chamomile tea and this one
is a chai tea and then my little Keurig
like coffee thingy right there and then
right here I just have some Trader Joe's
biotin dietary supplements which I don't
eat because I have eyelash extensions
and I don't want my eyelashes to fall
out so I have not been
eating those then right here I just have
these little oatmeal containers and it's
really nice because these are so
convenient you just put a little bit of
water like from the fridge take the top
off fill it up and then put it in the
microwave for like two minutes and then
you make oatmeal and then I'll just put
like a cut-up banana on top and those
are so convenient and nice to have and
then finally it last but not least you
guys know that these are my favorite
again I just have another thing of the
Thomas Light 100-calorie multigrain
English muffins so that is what I keep
in my shelves and then also in my fridge
for what I eat so I hope that that gave
you guys a good idea of what I like to
eat in college I do live in an apartment
all by myself so I have to go grocery
shopping for myself and cook for myself
as well so I usually try to cook
breakfast and lunch with the things that
I have for breakfast I'll just have like
scrambled eggs and spinach and then some
Ezekiel bread and then for lunch
I'll usually just have maybe like a
little salad and I'll cut up some tomato
and apple and cucumbers and have some
almonds it just really depends on like
how busy I am that day and like what I'm
doing and then for dinner like I was
showing you I love to cook my hello
fresh meals again I will have a link to
their website down below and you guys
can use my code for $30 off of your
first week and to end off the video if
you guys want to see a what to eat in a
day video like anything really that has
to do with like eating and how I eat
just let me know in the comments down
below give this video a thumbs up don't
forget to subscribe I will be doing more
of these eating cooking types of videos
as it gets warmer out and you like gets
to be spring because I just feel like
once it gets nice out I like get so much
more motivated to cook and I I don't
know I just feel like I have so many
more good snacks and all that good stuff
so I'm gonna end off this video here I
hope that you guys enjoyed it
