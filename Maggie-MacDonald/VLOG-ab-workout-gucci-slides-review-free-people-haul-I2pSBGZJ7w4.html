first day like officially of summer I
don't have any classes anymore any
finals
nothing like that I'm super pale right
now okay
like looks really bad but whatever I am
also like breaking out because I put
self tanner on my face the other day
don't put self tanner on your face well
I know some people can do it but like I
can't do it because like my skin is so
sensitive so yeah oh and I also just got
my eyelashes done that wink by Kat so if
you guys want to like go to Wayne King
Gary eyelashes and I'll leave a link for
their like website down below you can
book an appointment you can also use my
code
Maggie tend to get 10% off of all of
your services and I get my lashes done
by Kat and she does something different
every single time like I don't have a
specific um like set that I get she just
kind of does what she feels and like
changes it up every single like time I
got which I love and this is what I'm
just wearing today right now so I can go
get a coffee because I just drank two of
these big waters and now like I need to
a bit of coffee but I wanted to hydrate
a little bit before but I'm just wearing
this free people like big sweatshirt
that kind of like can be worn as a dress
I mean it's kind of short but whatever
and then I'm also wearing my Gucci
slides with it I'm just going to put on
some sunglasses or maybe even a hat and
then head out and go get a coffee and I
also got a bunch of the new stuff out
for you people yesterday actually I can
show you guys right now so and then I
can put it away in my closet but I'll
have all of these items linked down
below as well as the sweatshirt that I'm
wearing right now and this is what I got
this little bra that thing which I think
will be really cute with like loose
pants over the summer and I got this in
a size well then I also got this bikini
for Aruba which is so cute and it's by
the brand Tabak and so these are the
bottoms and they're just these small
cheeky bottoms
and this is the top right here I got the
easiness I smell and then this is the
top also in a size small and it's like a
hibiscus II color I think and then it
just has like a double wrap around the
back and adjustable straps so that's
super cute and then what else do I get
oh I got this talked to I don't want to
like put it on my fuzzy blanket because
this like gets fuzzies everywhere but
it's just this free people movement
little tank top with a high neck and
it's a really nice material and
everybody's been asking like what Bry
where with my little cropped tank tops
and I actually don't wear a bra this
one's a lot thicker than my forever 21
tank tops which is good so when I don't
wear a bra with it like you won't be
able to tell at all and then last but
not least I got this wait what is in
this oh they gave me a water right here
it's kind of cute they gave me water
because I bought stuff from they are
free people movement line and then I
also got this jacket right here if I can
like manage to show you guys it's just a
denim jacket okay here we go it's just
this denim jacket with a raw cut edge
and I think this is so cute I really
wanted a new denim jacket I used to have
one from j.crew but like it was too
fitted to my body and I didn't like it
just like wasn't my vibe anymore so I
got this one from free people and I got
it in a size extra small so extra small
about this in a medium the sweatshirt
I'm wearing right now the bathing suit
in a size small this in an extra small
small and that miss small and I just got
a package so I'll show you guys what I
got when I got in the car when I get in
the car
I know exactly what I got it and I've
been so excited to get this package all
week oh my god they're so cute so I got
another pair whole lines in there
this periwinkle blue color that I'm like
obsessed with right now if you guys
couldn't tell they like match my nails
and they also match my whole case which
is from Amazon it was like $10 or $15
and it came with a pack of like 10
different colors I'll have those laid
down below so I'm gonna start like doing
that more like having the direct links
for you guys just because a lot of you
guys always ask me you're like where did
you get this where did you get this and
like instead of telling you where it's
from I feel like I have so much more
time now that I'm done with school I'm
gonna put the direct link so it'll be a
lot easier for you guys to find whatever
you're looking for but now I really need
to go get a coffee
because it's like 11:45 and I'm a dying
you coffee I didn't need one every
single morning it's so bad I'm out the
drive-through and I just ordered my
coffee and I got mininum iced banana nut
from Mary Lou's and I asked for a splash
of almond milk this time just because I
feel like when I ask for a little bit of
almond milk they still give me like too
much where it's too milky and less
coffee so let's see if this makes it oh
my god there's a huge beam next to me
there was a huge like Hornet in my room
the other day I'm not even getting it
was like this big it was disgusting it
was on the wall are like the window in
my room and I was so freaked out to go
in my room and like I needed to change
so bad but I couldn't because the views
of my room and usually like I'm not
afraid of like bugs and stuff like that
but it was huge and I don't want to get
some baby that's just like I don't want
that so I had to call Tyler and I was
like well I told him about it I didn't
call him and have him feel it for it for
me he I told him about it he was like do
you want me to come over and he'll and I
was like you know what no they are
offering yes
but yeah that was really freaky my
stomachs growling I also need to eat
something
so I got my coffee literally as she
opens up the window she was like oh is
this too light for you and I was like up
I felt so bad like I did not want to
have to be like oh wait like half a
little bit more like coffee in it but I
was like yes like I'm so sorry I felt so
bad I don't want to do that at all but
like it just came out cuz it was so
light and I just said to you guys like I
hope it's not like because I said like a
splash but then she was so cute the girl
was so nice and she made me a new coffee
so this is like what I normally like it
to like look like but yeah I am having
literally the best day ever so oh my god
I'm like getting emotional over this
okay so Gretchen just texted me which
was so cute she texts me and goes at
Maggie I binge-watched so many of your
videos last night to catch up and I just
realized when I was reading the comments
of how your subscribers look up to you
like how much I look up to you and what
a positive impact you've made on my life
already so I came out of nowhere this so
deep haha but love you sis like I like
brings tears to my eyes cuz like I'm so
like I don't know I don't want to like
cry but it just like makes me emotional
because I'm just so thankful it's like
half Gretchen in my life and they have
her as a best friend and like to have
you guys and like
Haley just got back um to have like you
guys like I just like lost my whole
train of thought but basically to have
like you guys in my life and to have
Gretchen and like a little Asian trip or
like I can be friends with Gretchen also
like the best friends with like Emma too
and like all of us can be friends
together and like just like all the
traveling that I do like being able to
do it all with Gretchen like experience
these things like have someone who's
like genuinely a really good friend that
I can like be best friends with into
something that I love with and also like
I'm just so thankful for like all of you
guys and stuff because like you don't
realize it like uploading videos every
single day like doing stuff like that
and like seeing how much you guys like
really look up to me like as a role
model and stuff like I don't know I just
like love that and I'm like losing my
train of thought now like I just got
really emotional over it like I'm just
so happy but on a brighter note
well that was bright but like on another
note tomorrow I'm going out to lunch in
Boston like walking on Newbury Street
and stuff with Gretchen
and Kyle and Michael and if you guys
don't know Kyle and Michael I'm like
losing my train of thought right now I
don't know why I just like got really
Spacey but Kyle and Michael just started
a vlog channel and Kyle is Tyler's
brother Tyler my boyfriend so we're
hanging out with Kyle and Michael
tomorrow
Michael is Kyle's boyfriend in Tyler's
my boyfriend in Kyle's Tyler's mother
that's kind of confusing but you guys
will meet them tomorrow in the vlog and
I'm so excited they sounded followed
channel and they're literally the cutest
ever I talked about them and my Q&amp;amp;A
video I think I was like guys you need
to look at their vlogs but they're so
cute
they started to channel we're all
getting out tomorrow and it's just gonna
be really fun I'm really excited
I just cut lunch and this is what I'm
gonna have it's like - or time visit 242
right now so I'm gonna eat this little
cookie salad and then head to the gym
because I haven't worked out yet today
but I was noticing these pants with a
lot like my other ones that I have that
are kind of blue so I'm gonna compare
them but I think whenever these to the
gym today I like a lot of getting new
workout pants just because I feel like
it makes me so much more motivated to
like have a really hard workout these
are what the pants that look like and I
noticed that they're not the same as the
ones that I happen now that I like put
them on my body and are like looking at
them they are not the same but I think
they're super cute I really love this
color and it like makes me look a lot
more tan than I really am but I need to
figure out which sneakers I want to wear
I've been loving my APL's lately so I
honestly might wear my epls just because
I know I'm gonna be doing like an absent
cardio workout today and also a lot of
you guys have been asking me like for my
ab workout and so I think I'm gonna
bring you guys to the gym with me and
record like what I'm doing for a workout
and like show you guys because I don't
know I feel like abs and cardio is like
my favorite thing ever and so I'm gonna
do that and I hope that you guys like
that if you do I'll keep doing more of
those types of videos or like at least
incorporating in my vlogs like a little
portion of me working out but yeah so
I'm gonna do that Tyler's gonna be
picking me up for the gym in a little
while oh my god I'm like so matching
today like my pants my phone case and my
nails that's really funny uh but I've
had like the busiest most productive day
today and that's what I love I love when
it's like more mount when I can go and
like do productive things and be busy
and I don't know I just feel like I can
get so much more done when it's nice out
because I'm so much more motivated
and also my face is breaking out I don't
know if I like oh I did tell you guys
I've had self-tanner on my face
don't do that ever because it made me
break out really bad and so now I like
don't know to you but I also I think
that this side of my face is breaking
out yeah it still looks like really bad
I don't even want to like show it on
camera it's like really gross but that's
life I feel like it's such a common
thing for people to like break out like
get acne and stuff but for me my skin it
usually never gets acne like I'll get a
few pimples here and there which is
normal but this has been like four
months like it's literally acne and I
got medicine from the dermatologist like
professionally like looked at and
everything and it like hasn't helped at
all so honestly I think I know what it
is and I think it's the water in the
town where like I go to school I go to
school in Bridgewater Massachusetts in
my freshman year of college I got acne
like on my back and I was like that's so
weird that I'm getting acne on my back
because I don't ever get any acne and I
played hockey all growing up and I would
always wear just a sports bra with my
hockey equipped me like my shoulder pad
and stuff over it and I never gotten
acne from anything until I went to
college until I lived in the dorm so
that was definitely the water because
once I went home it was like cleared up
right away and it happened in March just
like this and so then again my sophomore
year the same thing happened to me in
March like I started breaking out a
little bit on my back but I was like you
know what this is the same thing that
happened last year I need to catch it
right away so I went to the
dermatologist got the medicine it
cleared up but this is different because
it's like on my face I just think it's
so weird and I've stopped using every
single product I like don't use anything
still hasn't worked
I don't eat differently and I don't know
what else it could be other than the
fact that the water here is disgusting
so hopefully that it will clear up like
when I go home in a few weeks or being
in Aruba next week with like the salt
water and the Sun on it I just feel like
it's gonna be so much better early for
my skin it's up so I'm hoping that it
clears up but whatever
so I didn't end up filming like
everything he did at the gym today just
because there were so many people like
that I knew and stuff that I was just
like I don't know Malik he didn't want
to like film myself working out like I'd
want another kind of like get my workout
over with and get out of there but it
was a really good workout and eventually
I'll end up like show you guys what I
did
but now I'm gonna order dinner and I
just want to show you this shirt that
I'm wearing sorry to like put the camera
so this is that Free People top that I
showed you guys a little bit earlier I
love it I'm just wearing it with my
brandy joggers and my Gucci slides which
somebody messaged me was like Maggie can
you do a review on your Gucci slides and
hmm honestly let me show you them this
is what they look like up close and the
lighting is so bad in my room right now
because of the Sun but this is what they
look like and they are just rubber with
like the detailing on the front like the
flowers and the Gigi and honestly my
adidas ones are better quality and these
were really uncomfortable at first but
the more I wore them it like broke them
in but they're definitely comfortable
they're really lightweight my adidas
ones are definitely more heavy than
these are and I'll have these ones
linked down below as well if you guys
want to get them I think they're really
cute because like my D just ones I feel
like looked weird without fits like they
weren't as cute as these ones weren't
like for spring I just want to make a
cute shoe that I can like throw on and
like go about my day and these are
definitely perfect for that oh and
tomorrow I also need to get new brandy
pants because mine are like really like
itchy and pilly but not like that pili I
don't really know how to describe it I
don't know if you can really see in this
lighting but like they're scratchy I
just want to get new ones because you
guys know that I read joggers every
single day so I feel like there's gonna
be no better feeling than like a fresh
new soft pair available joggers and I'm
gonna be going to Boston tomorrow so
I'll probably get some on Newbury Street
but I want to like pick out what I'm
gonna wear and when I were just on
FaceTime in my phone dad but I want to
pick out what I'm gonna wear tomorrow
just because I'm gonna get typed with
tonight in the name of Tyler because I
haven't hung out with him these past
couple of days for like two days like we
went to the gym together yesterday and
today but like we didn't like hanging
out at night or anything like I hung out
here and they got a bunch of stuff done
I need to get done he'll go to his house
like hung out with his friends so we're
gonna hang out together tonight and I
changed my phone case to this blue one
right here it's like teal and a lot of
you guys were asking me where I got them
and I got them on Amazon feels so good
to like be in my apartment
with like the a/c going happen it'd be
like nice out but I think I'm gonna end
off the vlog here just because all I'm
doing is ordering Thai food and then
Tyler and I are gonna hang out so I
don't really have anything else to vlog
but from Thai food if you guys are
wondering what I'm gonna get I'm
probably gonna get the wait what does it
call them like drawing a blank
chicken saute that's not again I get the
chicken saute which is like grilled
chicken on the stick and I also get a
side of steamed mixed vegetables which
is like the broccoli carrots and snap
peas or whatever and it comes with
cabbage and baby form and I say no
cabbage and no baby corn then I'm also
going to get a side of brown rice and
then the peanut sauce which is so good
so I'm gonna have that for dinner and
yeah so that is what I did today nothing
too exciting and hope you guys enjoyed
this video in this vlog I'm sorry that
my vlogs like really boring right now
but I just promise you once I get home
for the summer that my vlogs are gonna
be so much more exciting and I don't
know I can't wait to like be with ABBA
like the on the Cape and be doing
different things like showing you guys
all different places and such and also
being in Boston with Gretchen because
she
is staying in Boston for the summer
