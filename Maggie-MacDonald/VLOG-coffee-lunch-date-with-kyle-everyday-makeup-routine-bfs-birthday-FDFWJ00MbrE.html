heavenly Donuts and we are in North
Andover you guys are wondering if you

I'm obsessed now and I like this better
than Mary Lou's you do yeah I do

Mary Lou's and I have it every single
day I'm like but this is so good like I
craved it I've been craving it mmm and
the flavors are more like you taste them
warm
there's a bunch there's a bunch of
flavor so easily just like bouncers yeah
there's so many flavors I don't know if
you guys have are gonna see the blog
from yesterday yeah I I need to figure
out like when I'm uploading anyway I was
telling you guys that like the coffee is
brewed the flavors are like in the bean
so there's no Seraph or anything cuz you
guys know I don't like adding anything
to make copies a blog coffee so there's
so many different flavors and today I
got an Internet and you got so
as many as a lot
so I wanted to show you guys my face
again I have an update a skin update so
I got the mask by glam glow and it's
like the one that has the sparkles all
in it the black one and so I put it on
yesterday and I actually feel like it
helps my like bumps on the side of my
face but you haven't gone away yet and
it's good because I have a dermatologist
appointment on the Thursday so I'm gonna
go back to the doctor and tell them that
like the medicine that they gave me
didn't work and see like what's up I
honestly don't know what it is at this
point I've tried everything I don't I
literally don't wear makeup I don't put
anything on my face I don't use any
products I don't eat a certain different
way like I don't do anything different
it's like I have no idea like what it
could be but like always I'll keep you
guys updated or what it is I just want
to tell you that the masculine kind of
cleared it up but it's still like a
little bit red we're now in like town we
went to and over
and we're going shopping or you know
just because there's like nothing to do
and you don't know what to do it's so
gross out and they look at my outfit
like I'm wearing my SoulCycle sweatpants
with this swatch is like really old one
that's Tyler but it should be but we're
going shopping right now to this story
that I went to with Tyler Jalisco and
this stuff is so cute they have an
Instagram it's where I got my heat rings
that I usually wear on this finger like
the gold and so we're going there
looking for a bathroom in this place
does it say restroom
this is our cue to leave
I think need to go pee so bad my
father's umbrella for making mom
this smoothie was so good clearly I
already just drink all of it
and his mine was um coconut water mango
pineapple spinach and it was really
light and yummy and I got the acai so I
feel like it's what good face is of like
an acai bowl and this is really thick
and mine oh oh the acai makes it thick
mm-hmm I'm I'm just really light and
yummy yeah but it's just very light and
so yummy is - mm-hmm
does the Aussie makes it sec that's why
I like a smoothie bowls are so thick
because of the acai kyle has been
telling me about this wrap for ever and
this is the first time I get to try it
I'm not gonna show you that without it
arty but basically I'm probably this is
chicken avocado tomato honey mustard
cheese is that it I think that's it
on a wheat wrap and then it's like
grilled like a panini and you guys know
I love sauce with wraps if you follow
like my food account but it's so good
lunch was so good I'm ready for nap
again yesterday Tyler like randomly took
a nap
because we were so tired from like
everything that we did yesterday
but like threw me off for the rest of me
I wonder how his birthday's going I
should text him but he's been so busy at
work I'm gonna text him and see it was
so funny I was creeping on Kyle's
Instagram I'm gonna insert the picture
right here because he was wearing the
same exact sweatshirt with the hood up
and he was like I had a little filter on
and I was like you know what I'm gonna
recreate this this sweatshirt Tyler was
like oh my brother stole this I'm just
getting it back that he could have his
knees at me I was like it's so soft
music acted it so old so I was like okay
so Kyle and I did like a bunch of work
and stuff we'll make off back from
everything that we did today and it was
really fun so we just like kind of
chilled like got some stuff done and
then and watch them into YouTube videos
but now Tyler they're gonna go out to
dinner for a birthday and yeah so I'm
really excited for that he's finding
little work you see me shot right now
but I wanted to kind of show you guys
like my little makeup routine and it's
so simple and easy I literally use three
products three products three products
so I'm gonna start off by using the Too
Faced chocolate bronzer this is an OG
for me I've been using this like forever
it smells so good and I just got a brand
new one
so I just take my bronzer and then a big
fluffy brush I'll have all these items
like linked down below if you guys you
can get them but this one's just the
Real Techniques powder brush um so I put
it the product on my brush and then
apply it and then I always make sure
really put it on my neck just because
you want your skin to match it
but I've been trying to use this bronzer
instead of the hoola bronzer just
because they feel like something someone
our bronzers is making me break up and I
don't know which one it is so I just
stopped using all my new ones that I
started that I recently started using in
the past like a couple months and I'm
just sticking to my basics and just
using the chocolate one again and then
I'm gonna take this little brush it's a
bronzer brush by hoola or benefit it's
like a hoola bronzer brush you can
really use any like contour brush and I
kind of just go in like the three motion
on my face and then I'm going to tweak
this vanity planet blush brush with my
favorite Tarte blush in the shade
glisten it's just a really nice rosy
pink color like that and has some
shimmer in it which I love so I'm gonna
apply that all over I like to put a lot
just because it is powder so I feel like
sometimes they like comes off since
there's nothing to really like stick
okay done last but not least my new
favorite product is an e benefit what's
up highlighter and I love this because
it's a cream highlighter so I just take
it with my finger apply some to my nose
my Cupid's bow
and that of course
my cheekbones I'm just applying it with
my finger and it really like warms up
the product and I think applies really
nice it has a little brush like sponge
thing on the bottom
as you guys can see but I don't really
like using it I'd rather just warm up my
finger that is it and literally is under
five minutes so all I do it just gives
me like a nice natural glow that I love
you guys know that I'm really into like
the natural no makeup look so it's like
this is perfect and of course I have
eyelash extensions again if you guys
want to go to wink lash bar which is
where I go you can use my code Maggie
ten and get 10% off and again I'll have
all these items that link down below for
you guys it's still raining
oh my camera lens but I'm wearing my
Free People jacket
Brady Melville t-shirt Lululemon
leggings my tie you're gonna go in I
know for his birthday and get ice cream
sure well I have to enough my vlog I
didn't vlog anything at dinner but we
went what it was a place we called
