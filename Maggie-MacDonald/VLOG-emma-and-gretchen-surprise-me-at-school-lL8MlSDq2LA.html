I just want to show you guys like my gym
outfit if I don't get to like show you
before I go to the gym
jessica's I'm going to the gym with
Tyler and he's gonna pick me up but this
is what I'm wearing the same sports bra
as I showed you guys in my last vlog
it's just a black one I think it's
called the awakening bra and then these
are just aligns in this new like green
color that I got so yeah I'm like out of
breath like trying to get everything
done right now just because I have so
much homework oh my god Gretchen wrote
me a note
that's so cute I'm gonna read that but I
don't know what it says so I'm not gonna
like put it too close to the camera but
she probably didn't write anything bad
so yeah I'm gonna do that and to go to
the gym now and maybe bring you guys
with me to the gym we'll see like how
I'm feeling about that and like if I
have a time and stuff but I just need a
big big bowl or like plate of fruit and
I put it on the Instagram store and he
was really good then made me feel really
really really good because I love fresh
fruit like I forgot how like good it
tasted now that like all the fruit is
like in season and stuff and also I'm so
sorry my self tanner is jacked up on the
body like right here because I was
wearing a little mini backpack the other
day like right after I put it on and
it's like all messed up but whatever
hopefully that'll be fixed soon when I
go to Aruba so I'm gonna go bring this
up to the post office now and yeah I
just got back from the gym with Tyler
and I'm literally so tired oh my god my
workout today was so good I went on the
treadmill and I did 45 minutes of cardio
walking on an incline at the speed and 9
no incline 9.0 speed 3.6 and it was so
good
and like I sweat so much and then I did
ABS after
to finish it off and it was really
really good and I feel so good right now
and it like took out all my stress and
like everything that I was feeling today
but now I'm gonna do a bunch of homework
and make dinner I have so much homework
to do and like so much to do for finals
I literally don't want to do it cuz I
hate like the stress of everything but
I'm just gonna get it done so I don't
have to like think about it anymore and
yeah I think I'm gonna like go to
Tyler's house and do a lot of my
homework at his house like lay in bed
and do it just because like I can't get
anything done here at my apartment
cuz last time I tried to do homework at
my apartment I got so distracted with
like cleaning it and organizing my
closet instead of doing my homework so I
know that like I can't stay here also
I'll do everything but there's stuff
that I actually have to do so now I'm
gonna make it dinner and I just cleaned
up the dishwasher oh my god this candle
that I got from Target the other day
smells really really really good it's
called citrus sorbet and I've been
burning it in my kitchen it smells so
good and I finished packing up all of
the Poshmark orders from earlier so I'm
gonna ship those out and like clean up
my apartment my mattress right here
that's my old mattress before I got my
Lisa and my dad is coming to pick that
up and bring it back to my house on the
Cape but I need to like finish cleaning
up this area of my apartment cuz it's an
absolute mess and this is what I just
made for dinner I'm probably gonna put
it all into the bowl but I steamed some
carrots and broccoli and then I made
some tofu all I did was I put it in a
pan with some coconut oil and then added
like salt and pepper and red pepper
flakes and then I made brown rice so I'm
gonna eat this for dinner this is
usually like what I got from the Thai
food restaurant I just got like steamed
veggies tofu brown rice and I'm really
sad because I wish I had the peanut
sauce that comes with it from the Thai
restaurant it's probably not that great
for you so I guess it's better that I
just
made it at home so yeah that's what I'm
having for dinner wait guys I just tried
a piece of tofu and this is so good and
it's like so plain and healthy and
there's nothing that was added like to
any of this like the vegetables are just
steamed the rice was just cooked in
water and this was cooked with a tiny
tiny bit of coconut oil and then just
like all the spices on top like I'm
obsessed with this I'm literally gonna
be making this every single night I
really wanted ice cream tonight I don't
think you guys understand how bad I
wanted it but I've been eating like
really bad lately when it comes to like
sweets and stuff like last night I ate a
little um Ben &amp;amp; Jerry's ice cream bar
and also Twix bar and sour skittles so I
was like you know what I just had a
really good workout I'm gonna take a
break from the ice cream even though I
really want I'll probably get it
tomorrow and I just have emptied one of
these plain non-fat Chobani Greek
yogurts into a bowl and then put a ton
of fruit around it so I put like
raspberries cut up a few strawberries
and put honeydew melon and I'm gonna eat
this I'm also gonna put some cinnamon on
top and then that's what I'm gonna have
for my dessert and then I really need to
take a shower do homework because now it
is 7:40 and I am like slacking so bad so
I finally just showered and I read the
note that Gretchen left me and I started
laughing because earlier I was like all
like I don't know if I'm gonna show this
on camera and like we what it says just
because I didn't know like if it was
inappropriate like to tell you guys but
she's literally so cute look what she
wrote so I have this seven-days-a-week
pad of paper in my room where I can like
write down and stuff like check it off
for everything I have to do and she
wrote I love Gretchen and I love Emma
today is so fun we love bagels I love my
sisters they're my bridesmaids and then
she wrote I can't wait to visit you on
the Cape this summer mushy
I want smugglers and amber hee and then
she wrote hi my game is already I want
to live with you and we can thrive xoxo
gob hey-oh mags I also love that you and
Emma make me healthy
work out and then G wrote dear Myron I
love that we love yummy food and you'll
eat treats with me love Gretchen like
that's I think my favorite line out of
this whole diet thing dear Margot I love
that we love yummy food and that you'll
eat treats with me because that's like
my life with Gretchen
like her and I are always eating like
really yummy food and stuff yeah I look
disgusting right now I need to like get
off the camera and like stop recording
and like do my homework
xx to end off the vlog before I go to
Tyler's house cuz I'm gonna do some work
and stuff but obviously like I'm not
gonna vlog at his house or anything like
that but yeah so oh my god I just want
to show you guys I've been using these
bags from Urban Outfitters as like my
overnight bags I don't know like I
really like them and I just think that
they're like perfect in the perfect size
so yeah and then I'm bringing my blanket
that I just got from Target it's like so
soft and today Gretchen and I more like
Maggie need to wash that blanket like
it's getting fuzzy things everywhere so
I wash it and dried it and it's so soft
it smells so good and I think can't
forget to bring this but and yeah so
