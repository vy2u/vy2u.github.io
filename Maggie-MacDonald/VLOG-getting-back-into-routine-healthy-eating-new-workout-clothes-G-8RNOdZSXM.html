forever oh my god because like I've been
sick for so long and then I just have
had like finals and stuff so I've been
like so busy this is really weird but
last night I was up doing like a project
that was jus this morning and I stayed
up till 5 o'clock in the morning doing
it 5 o'clock and like I feel so like
sick right now I need to get a coffee
but we're going through my packages that
I got this is from pretty little thing
it's just a little cropped tank top yeah
it's so cute I like forgot that I
ordered this pretty little thing takes
so long to come in so like when I order
stuff I completely forgot that I even
got it and this was $10 and how cute is
that just a nice little basic staple to
have I just wiped off my camera lens and
I feel like it's a lot more clear now
okay so I got this from pretty little
thing what is this I got these weird
like cards and stuff in the mail that
aren't for me it's for like the person
who lived there before so yeah I should
have just throw those away okay and then
I got this box right here and I have no
idea what's in here but I'm gonna have
to use my keys
I like never know what's coming in the
mail almost like I order it I have no
idea what this is right now my nails are
really weak right now because I've had
gentlemen for so long and I like peeled
it off I say because I was really
stressed about school so yeah they're
like really thin and bad and this like
hurts to open this but I think I'm gonna
give my nails a break from like getting
I've literally got a gel manicure every
two weeks for the past like over a year
and that's so bad I just want to like
let my nails breathe and like give them
break what the heck is this oh my god
okay now I know what it is so I got a
watch for Tyler for his graduation and
then I also got my dad one for Father's
Day because they were having like a deal
thing so yeah I'm gonna show those in a
different vlog not right now just cuz
like I really want their coffee but I'll
show those later but wow that's like
really fast I just ordered them the
other day
hi I'm could I please get a medium iced
banana not with a little bit of almond
milk anything else that's it
thank you wait this is so weird so at
Mary Lou's you guys probably know Lee
from watching my videos usually they
have a little short pink straw and it's
like skinny and candy and I always talk
about how it's like the perfect straw
because it's like small and you get the
right amount of coffee but today they
gave me this big straw with it that like
feels different but the coffee is really
good I've been getting a little bit of
almond milk just because like I don't
really know now that it's like warm out
I like like it right now
and also I haven't had anything to eat
today which is really bad it's like 1
o'clock because I like woke up late
because I say about until 5:00 you guys
know that so I wanted to get almond milk
to like give me like more energy like
from protein from almonds if that's even
a thing I don't even know but now I am
gonna go to Target I'll bring you guys
along with me I love going to target my
camera's all messed up I don't want to
vlog and drive it so I will see you up
there
mwah so I'm in target right now and I
just want to show you guys they have the
best candles like this one right here I
used to have in my apartment it smells
so good and it's only ten dollars but
there's this one that I have in my room
right now and it smells so good and I
don't know where it is
but I really want it like a bigger one
for my bathroom but I have no idea where
it is I'm gonna be so sad if they don't
have it but it kind of look looks like
this has like a little top like that and
it's cold
so I'm pretty sure I found the one I
have in my room and it's called citrus
sorbet so I'm gonna get this one right
here but I also want to find like
another candle I think these ones are so
cute with the little cord top but none
of them smell good target has accused
accessories if you guys saw my room tour
you I think I got a bunch of them from
Target but look how cute this is it's a
little wooden llama but it's 20 dollars
like I don't know if I would spend $20
on this I just think it's so cute maybe
unlike those little shelves that I have
in my room my favorite blogger Steve on
Ayla has these chairs right here in her
office at her new house and I am
obsessed with them I wish I could put
this in my like apartment room the room
is so small I would never fit like how
cute is everything in all them section
at Target
it's literally like my aesthetic
everywhere I love it like even these are
cool
unlike imagine having a marble table in
your house I like marble countertops and
then having like these little cute
things I counter to like cook with I
really can't wait to have my own house
one day decorating it's gonna be my
favorite part in the real reason why I
came to Target today because I needed
more hangers for my closet I really like
these ones but I don't know if I should
get a big box off
and that is why I can never go to Target
because I literally buy everything but
whatever I like needed to get new boxes
to go in like that white cube thing in
my room like I was telling you guys
because I bought a bunch of boxes to go
inside of them and they ended up being
way too big and they didn't fit so I'll
show you guys the ones that I got when I
get home but I'm really hungry and I
don't know like what to do for food I
don't know like how far away the Whole
Foods is like from where I am right now
cuz I kinda wanna go to Whole Foods I
don't know like what's doing it's
raining I like don't want to do anything
today and I have so much homework but
I'm gonna see where Whole Foods is it's
four miles 60 minute drive yeah not
today
that kinda stinks like wanted something
from Whole Foods kind of maybe I'll just
drive there no 260 I really don't know
what to do and it also needs to get my
hair cut soon cuz I don't know if you
can tell my hair is so long and I don't
know I just think eating it like fresh
basil I just got the Whole Foods and I
could not forget to bring some of these
inside with me guys you're gonna freak
so I got this in the mail a little while
ago and I was like what the heck is in
this little envelope and it's all of
these little healthy
kombucha like coupons for a free bottle
and I think you can use five of them out
of time so that's exactly what I'm gonna
do but they sent me these because they
know how much I love healthy kombucha so
I've been like obsessed with using them
just because how Vika bucho is actually
kind of expensive it's like four dollars
for like a bottle or usually they're
like two for sex but that's still kind
of a lot and so I'm going
use those right now and then go look at
something for a little lunch I ran into
Whole Foods for like five minutes
and now it's all wet in my car but it
was sunny before I went inside but
whatever at least I didn't stay in there
and eat cuz none of my car would have
been soaking wet but I wanted to show
you guys what I got for lunch I also
felt like a bunch of kombucha back there
but I want to show you what I got for
lunch because this is like the best hack
for a sandwich from Whole Foods
Emma taught me it so shout out to you
alone I'm gonna eat it when I get home
but I just want to show you guys before
in case it gets all like weird and gross
from driving but this is it so good it's
tomato basil mozzarella and pesto and
then also the trick to it is adding red
wine vinaigrette and it's really really
really good so you can just go up to
like the sandwich person and then fill
out one of the what are those things
called like papers where you like check
off every like ingredient you want in
your sandwich if you ever been to Whole
Foods so you do that and then just tell
them that you want it like press like a
panini it's so good
but I'm excited to eat it so now I'm
gonna drive home eat it
unpack all the stuff I got from Target
I'll show you guys what I got if you
didn't like already see a little bit
when I was like loading it into the car
and then I really need to work out
Tyler's at the gym right now and usually
like we go to the gym together every day
but he already went so I'm gonna have to
go alone but yeah I don't know I just
had the weirdest day because obviously
you guys know same feel 5 o'clock and
then I woke up really late like this
Jays just all thrown off it feels so
strange I need to finish all my homework
I just want school to be over it's like
stressing me out so bad so I finally
just unpacked all my stuff from Target
this is the blanket that I got it's
really really soft so I'm excited to lay
with that and again this is that little
tank top I was showing you guys earlier
today what else did I get
oh yeah I got these little baskets to go
in these
little shelves right here but I don't
know if I should move this basket right
there and do kind of like I don't I have
no idea how to do it but that's just
what this area looks like it kind of
looks funky to me so I need to like
figure out what to do with that and then
I bought a bunch of hangers like I was
telling you guys because I have a ton of
stuff that I just hung up and I know
like from here over is all new stuff
that I have to show you guys in hauls
but I've just been like so busy with
school and everything so I haven't been
able to show that stuff yet and all of
this stuff is stuff that I already own
that I really need to go through and
like decide what to keep and what not to
keep because I have way too much stuff
to fit in this little tiny closet like
as you can see look how full my closet
yes this room is just way too small for
me I've came to the conclusion but
that's okay
and then in here I have some accessories
and stuff that I have to show you in
part of the haul as well and also that
so I'll just throw that in there for now
actually I was gonna fold up my blanket
and put it into that basket hmmm if I'll
just go back to the gym I'm like out of
breath might work it was really really
good and I don't know I just like feel
really good right now I've been trying
to like eat as healthy as I can like
after doing all that traveling that I
just did I kind of like came back and
felt like really bloated and like I
don't know just like unmotivated not my
best so I've been like going to the gym
and like working out a lot and stuff and
I also got new workout clothes so I'm
wearing this sports bra from Lululemon
I'll have it linked down below it fits
really really well and I don't know if
you guys can this lighting is awful I'm
so sorry but um I don't know if you guys
can really see this is just what it
looks like and I actually got it in a
size 8 and usually I'm a size 4 in
Lululemon but I like my sports for us to
be like a little bit longer on me not
like super high up because I know if I
got a 4 it would have been like way high
like a normal sports one but this one
kind of has like a little bit more
cropped so I did get in a size 8
the size literally doesn't matter at all
all it means is that it like allows it
to be a little bit longer so yeah for
size reference I'm a 34b by the way and
then I got these lines and they're these
really cool like raspberry pink color I
really like them a lot so I got these in
size 4 and I'll have all the stuff that
I'm wearing like this sports bra into
pants link down below for you guys but I
just got back from the grocery store and
I just wanted to show you guys like what
I got actually I'm gonna turn on this
late too because it was kind of dark so
I just wanted to do a little grocery
haul and go through everything just
could you guys kind of like when I do
that so I got some Olivia's organic baby
spinach
I got bagel thins those are my favorite
I really really like these a lot
just because it's not as like thick as a
real bagel so when I eat it like I don't
feel awful and it doesn't give me a
stomach ache I love those like with
peanut butter on them and I also got two
little bananas and some brown rice and
then I also got some cottage cheese
because I like to have this on the bagel
fans as well it's like a good source of
protein and then I also got as you guys
know my favorite cinnamon raisin Ezekiel
bread and what's that here oh and then I
also got tofu because I hate cooking
chicken by myself I only like grilled
chicken and I don't have a grill here I
have to cook it on the stove and I don't
really like the way that it tastes so I
got tofu because I've been loving tofu
and steamed veggies lately and I got
some pita bread because I've also been
on like a Greek salad kick I've been
obsessed with Greek salads and then I
also got some eggs because I eat eggs
every single morning and then the bottom
here is just a bunch of fresh fruit that
was like on the specials for the week
and these are just some organic
strawberries and I love that it's
getting warmer out because fruits are in
season now and they're not like
eight dollars for a thing of
strawberries those are only 399 and then
these were two four six and they're just
organic raspberries so those will be
nice to have for a snack and then they
just got some pre-cut cantaloupe I'm
like filling up my whole counter right
now I got some cantaloupe and honeydew
melon because I didn't want to buy the
whole entire big fruit and then have to
like cut it myself because they don't
have a knife big enough that's why I buy
it pre-cut but like usually when I'm at
home on the Cape we'll just buy like the
full one and Emma will usually like cut
it she has this big cutting board and
Sheikh loves cutting melon like that I
really don't know why but she does and
then I also got some carrots and these
ones are the ones that are cut like this
they're like crinkled what are they
called carrot chips and I'm gonna steam
these with broccoli and I usually do
that and have like tofu and brown rice
and calling tonight so I'm gonna put all
this stuff away and then like decide
what I want for dinner because I'm
actually really hungry right now and
what time is it 6:45 oh I also got a new
Apple watch shop if it'll ever focus
it's like an off-white color and I have
the gold series one Apple watch it's
really old and for dinner I'm just
throwing together a Greek salad in this
little Tupperware container and I like
using these because I could just put the
lid on and put balsamic vinegar and
shake it up and then like mix all of the
dressing stuff on my salad so that's why
I like to have it in these tough are
containers rather than like on a plate
and my base is just this Olivia's
organic baby romaine and then these are
all the things that I'm gonna be adding
on top of my salad
so I have caught up cucumbers and red
pepper tomato feta olives lemon and
these are banana peppers and then I put
it all on my salad add a little salt I
mean not salt pepper balsamic vinegar
and call it
day
and so this is the finished product and
yeah this is basically what I eat every
single day either for like lunch or
dinner
I just love Greek salads I am like
obsessed with them right now
so that is what it looks like and those
are the ingredients I put in super easy
to do at home I bought all the
ingredients for like $40 I think and
I've made so many salads with it so to
go out and buy a Greek salad it's like
15 dollars around like where I'm from so
I saved so much more money doing that so
I highly recommend making it at home if
you guys are able to like if you're in
college this is a super easy meal to
make and it's really really good it's
really good for you and also really
inexpensive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
