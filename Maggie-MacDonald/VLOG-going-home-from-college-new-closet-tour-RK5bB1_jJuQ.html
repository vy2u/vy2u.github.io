it's so bittersweet like I'm actually
kind of sad that I won't be living here
for a few months but I'm also really
excited to go home to the Cape and just
live with Emma and like my family and be
able to like see all my friends and
stuff and I don't know I'm just like so
excited so I am going to pack up all the
stuff that's like in my Alex drawers
that I'm going to need when I'm at home
and like pack up some of all of that
stuff and then also I'm gonna bring all
of my shoes and everything that's in my
closet I'm bringing all of my clothes
because the one thing that I hate when
you go somewhere and you don't bring
everything I feel like I would need
something so I'm gonna bring everything
in my closet and then also these boxes
up here and then all this stuff on my
bed well like this stuff not my bed and
my pillows and all that I'm gonna leave
that here and then those two big bags I
got these watches for Tyler's graduation
what's just passed over the weekend I
just gave him his gift but I also just
picked up a few of these just because
this company called armitron reach out
to me and wanted to work with me so
thank your armitron for sponsoring this
video and they have a bunch of different
watches and this brand is headquartered
in New York City and they offer a bunch
of different watches that are like
dressy and sporty to really go with any
outfit which I thought was perfect
because Tyler needed something like this
and his life I'm gonna open these all up
and show you guys what they look like
and as you can see right here this one
has like a green casual strap and this
one Tyler really really liked when I was
showing and the watches online and also
this one right here because it is
leather and more dressy so these were
his two favorites I'm gonna end up
giving these to him and then this one
was more kind of like older so I'm gonna
give this one of my dad and also
probably this one to my dad as well just
because I know Tyler probably wouldn't
wear the silver like metal strap just
because it's a little bit too dressy for
him and this one
really cool as well so I'm probably
gonna give this one to Tyler so we have
Tyler's graduation gift right here and
then these ones are my dad I'll probably
get these him for Father's Day but my
dad actually watches my video so I'll
probably give them to him as an early
gift cuz he's gonna end up seeing it
anyway so it'll ruin the surprise
but I just think these watches are a
perfect gift to give somebody like for
graduation like I'm doing for Tyler or
Father's Day for your dad because
they're very very affordable and they're
also like really stylish and I don't
know I just feel like when a boy wears
this watch it can really like dress up
they're open and add kind of like a
personality to it because I know like
Tyler can start wearing these when he
starts working and stuff since he just
graduated my dad can wear these to work
or like this one to work that one out to
dinner I don't know I just feel like
they add like a nice touch to a note and
I know that you can get these watches at
like Macy's or like JC Penney Kohl's and
even on Amazon you can get them at so
many different places but you guys can
also click the link down below in my
description box to purchase any of these
watches I just think that this one's
really nice I'm I'm excited for him to
wear this one I know Tyler's gonna love
this one
so I think I'm gonna wrap these up and
end up giving them to him right now I
honestly didn't realize how much stuff I
had until I tried to pack it all up to
bring home and I feel like that happens
to everybody like they don't realize how
much they actually have until you pack
it all out of it this is just what my
Alex would look like I'm almost done
going through all them this stuff is
just like tech accessories and stuff
that's what I was trying to say and then
this drawer right here just has a bunch
of like beauty products and things that
I need to try and these are my Yankee
Candle like scented jars so I can like
put them in this drawer has all of my
toiletries that I use every single day
like my brush these razerheadz
lotion micellar water some makeup wipes
so I'll probably end up bringing some of
this stuff home but I have to go through
that one next and this is my makeup
drawer and it's completely empty well
like with all the stuff that I use
because I put it all into this box right
here so I think I'm gonna just put all
my makeup products in there and then my
brushes and like lip products and
perfumes are in here so I'll bring those
home just because you never know what
you're gonna need during the summer so I
decided to bring home all of
the items that I wanted to like use and
try and make like different makeup looks
for videos and stuff this straw actually
is broken I can't open that one this one
it just has some of my extra loving tan
in it and I put some products in here
like the exfoliator met an applicator
mitt a fact allocator a bottle of dark
tanning mousse and I have a full bottle
home that I used for prom well she was
going to use but didn't end up using so
I'm gonna bring home half of this bottle
and then have a full bottle at home and
then half of some luminous cream and I'm
gonna leave all the rest here so I can
use it next year this drawer right here
just has some extra like beauty products
in it that I'm not gonna bring home
because I have two of these I'm not
gonna bring home any masks or anything
just because emma has so many masks it's
crazy I'll show you guys when I get home
and then this is just a bunch of masks
and nail products stuff like that that
I'm not gonna need because like I said
emma has so much and then in here I'm
gonna bring probably home these
scrunchies and some elastics just
because I'm always like wearing
different elastics and stuff and then
I'll probably leave those here I have a
ton of them in my car and then maybe for
in-home some lip products I'm not really
sure
and then obviously all of my jewelry is
gonna come back and I'm gonna leave all
of like my accessories here but bring
home obviously all this stuff my witch
hazel oh my speaker and then what's in
here sunglasses offering sunglasses home
I'll bring home all my Chargers and just
has extra candles and stuff so I'll pack
all that up but I also have some stuff
over here that I'm bringing from
underneath my bed obviously some tampons
and yeah and then I have to bring all my
bags and hats and I'm gonna try to fit a
lot of my stuff into these two suitcases
right here and then I have like baskets
with like short sweatshirts sweatpants
I'm gonna keep those in their baskets
and just put them in my trunk
oh and then I have all of my phone cases
and my camera
stuff right there thought I'm gonna
bring with me actually where's my camera
charger now that I think of it what's in
my desk
oh here it is entering that home and
then when I bring all my clothes home
I'm literally just gonna keep everything
on the hanger and put it in my back seat
that's why I think I'm gonna do just
because I don't wanna have to take
everything off the hanger fold it all up
take everything out once I get home I'm
just gonna scoop it all up bring it in
the car and put it in but I'm not gonna
bring home these leather jackets just
because I'm never gonna wear a leather
jacket during the summer but yeah I have
bathing suits in their sweatshirts
sweatpants underwear sports bras and
then I'm gonna bring home obviously all
of my bags and my shoes I really have so
much stuff this is so overwhelming I
just took all of my shoes off of this
rack which I just kept it up my tripod
and all of my like tank tops Lululemon
pants and like comfy shirts out of this
box right here and I did a really
efficient thing and I put them all in my
packing cubes and then all my shoes are
in this zipper pocket which I can't open
because I put like some sandals and
stuff in there so I'm just like
finishing up packing everything and then
Tyler's gonna come over and she's gonna
help me put it all in my house so I'm
finally home and all of my stuff
waiting my camera lighting is really
weird maybe it's like the lighting in
this room but all my stuff that was in
the back of my car
is all on the floor in my new room and
this is Emma's old mattress right here
that we are gonna be getting rid of
because I am gonna have my old bed in
this room and this is gonna be my new
room so I'll show you guys that like
once this summer is started and I can
like redecorate and stuff because I'm
gonna be gone until June 17th traveling
so I don't really need to like be in
here anyway but I just want to get all
of my stuff like into my new closet
which is right here and it's like a door
off of my room as you guys can see the
door just like opens up here and my
garage is under neath so this is like
our area over the garage in it these are
all of my clothes
from my closet at school me and I'm just
went to jackets I'm like out of breath
from running up and down the stairs and
like going in and out so I'm gonna
unpack all my stuff and organize it in
here and do something with these hangers
cuz I forgot that I had all of them I
know so I think I'm gonna move them to
the other side to your side in case you
have any extra stuff because this closet
is huge guys like my room at school is
smaller than this closet so this side is
gonna be like my side and Emma has a
walk-in closet in her room but she's
also gonna put like some extra stuff on
the side of her winter stuff and stuff
that she like doesn't wear or doesn't
have like room for and then my dad just
has like a few jackets right here but
it's really nice because we have like
these cubbies and all of this like
built-in space right here so I'm gonna
go through and like move all my stuff
into my closet and then I'll show you
guys like the finished product when it's
done so my closet is somewhat done this
is all of my clothes all organized by
color as you can see I'm gonna do an
updated closet tour like once I actually
get everything unpacked and get some
furniture and stuff that's so weird some
furniture for my closet but yeah so I
have like my jackets dresses all my
black stuff blue pink cream yellow white
as you can see I barely wear colors and
then this little chunk of clothing right
here isn't put away yet because I'm
going to be doing a spring lookbook
video under $200 all this stuff is super
cute I also have some accessories to go
with it too but then I have like my
hat's up here jeans denim shorts my two
Gucci bag boxes my Gucci slide box I
like was drawing a blank white and gray
sweatpants not white light gray dark
gray soft pants navy blue black

grey tank tops black tank tops my
Lululemon lines that are clean some
workout shorts and then over here I have
all of my sweatshirts hanging on this
rack and then I have like underwear
sports bras and all of my bikinis
underneath in these two boxes and then

like that for my socks and then I have
just heels sneakers more sneakers some

put this for actually bags a little good
year because I want to put this up and
hang my necklaces on it like I have at
school I don't know where I'm gonna do

then I'll put a table underneath because
I want to put a table in here so I can
have like my sunglasses and like little
shelving things so I'm gonna get
something from like Ikea or Target and
there's Emma and then all the stuff over
