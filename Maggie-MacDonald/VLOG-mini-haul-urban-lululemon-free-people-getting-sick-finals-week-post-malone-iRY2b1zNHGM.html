vlogged in so long because I've been so
sick because I just thought that I would
like blog right now I'm like update you
guys on my life and everything that I've
been like up to since I got back from
Coachella and actually like I'm really
sick or like I'm getting over a sickness
right now I've been really sick for the
past days Friday so literally like all
week I've been so sick ever since Sunday
and I've just been like laying in bed
and like napping and doing homework cuz
it's finals week and I and school on
Monday so I've just been like doing so
much schoolwork and like being sick and
everything so yeah haven't been like
filming or anything but I have so much
stuff that I want to show you right now
that's why I just thought that I'm vlog
right now just so like update you guys
my life and like do a little chitchat
like show you everything that I've been
buying lately cuz today I adjust a way
to shop and I bought a ton of stuff as
you can see like it's all on my bed
right now so I'm gonna go through and
show you guys everything that I got but
it's a little bit later in the afternoon
I'm just gonna try to clean up my room
and stuff and I wanted to get a coffee
because like I wanted a little bit more
energy because I'm going on with my
friends tonight since I'm finally
feeling feeling a little bit better so
I'm just drinking this for purpose
energy drink just because I didn't want
to get like a coffee right now cuz I
feel like it ruins like the purpose for
me I don't know if you guys agree or
they feel the same way but I feel like
getting a coffee this late at night like
when it's around five o'clock it just
like doesn't taste as good as when you
get them in the morning I don't know
it's like less enjoyable so I'm drinking
this for a purpose energy drink and I
don't know I just feel like it's a lot
better for you than like other energy
drinks because usually like I would it
be the type of person that would like go
pick one up at the store but this one is
USDA Organic it is certified Fairtrade
it's kosher
it's vegan it's like organic it's really
healthy for you like more than any other
energy drinks and like I don't know if
you guys can see the nutrition label on
the back it's so much better for you
then like a monster energy drink I'll
have a link for for a purpose energy
down below for you guys
and also a discount code that you guys
can use if you want to try these out oh
yeah I'm just like drinking this right
now just cuz I have had a really long
day and I wanted to like be able to have
some energy fortunately like I was
saying so now I'm gonna show you guys a
little like haul of everything that I
got today and wait where should I start
off actually I'm gonna start with
anthropology this is my night well
because I literally drank so much I
think my last night and then it's up for
11 hours but I got one of their
signature candles and I forgot what the
name of them is but I came and like this
really cool container usually it's like
a white one with a brass top but this
one's kind of like pinkish purple II and
this is blue but it smells really really
good right now in my room and then I
also got another one of my vanilla
perfumes because I just ran out of it so
I got that to go on my new money tray
and this is really ugly so I'm gonna put
that in my drawers just because I don't
really want that like on display in my
room I don't know why
Nelson is still over there but I also
got these two perfumes from Urban
Outfitters that I'm gonna put on this
tray right here and they smell really
really good this one is the coconut one
and it just gives off like a really
fresh like smell and it kind of reminds
me of summer so it like reminds me of
Emma after she that goes to the beach
and takes a shower that one smells
really good and then this one right here
is I can't even pronounce the name I
don't even know what it's called but
this one smells like the love pink spray
like the body mist that you used to get
when you were in middle school the one
with the purple top on it you know all
that used to come and they'd be like in
those tall like little plastic container
things and there is it going with a
purple top and a blue top and a pink top
this one smells just like the one with a
purple top so I got that one and I'm
just gonna keep them right here along
with all my other little perfumes that I
have going into the rest of the stuff I
got from Urban I also just got these
little hair ties right here and I have
one in my hair right now I'll show you
guys
I don't know like if you can really see
but I have one on my ponytail right now
I don't know I think kind of looks cute
like maybe to have these like on your
wrists they like don't look as bad I was
like this does and then also from urban
I got this really cool top and it's like
a white kind of knit top and this string
part on the bottom wraps around her body
a bunch of times and it like ties and I
think that's really cool look really
good with jeans and I also got a denim
skirt and this is what it looks like
it's just plain and I got this in an
extra small and this in a size small and
then I got these Tommy Hilfiger
sweatpants in a size medium and I don't
know I just thought that they're really
soft and cozy and this is what they look
like and they just say how thick are all
down the side and these are really
different for me because these ones are
flare and you usually you guys know I
like joggers but these were just so
comfy that like I could not say no to
them I have to get them and then I also
just got this straw beach bag because
I'm going to Aruba in a couple weeks so
this will be good to just throw like my
tanning oils and stuff and like head
down to the pool or go to the beach with
that then I also got a package in the
mail and it was two pairs of Lululemon
on lines that I just ordered and I
usually get mine in a size 4 so these
are just the size 4 and I think the
color of these ones is sage and I have a
green pair right now but they're a lot
darker than these you can't really tell
on camera but these are kind of like a
light army green I really like that
color and then these ones right here are
like a pinky like raspberry color and I
really like those so I got two pairs of
pants from Lulu on mine and also two
sports bras but they haven't came in yet
I'm sorry I can't talk cuz I'm like
still a little bit sick but yeah my
sports bras haven't come in yet so I
just have these and I wanted to get like
a new workout clothes so when I go to
Aruba I have like motivation to still
work out while I'm on vacation and then
the next thing I got are just these
shoes they are saludos and I got the
mondo
from shop but I think I'm gonna return
them because they're kind of big on me
and these are what they look like and
they don't really look that good on me
but I'm just gonna try them on again
like when I have a dress on and see if
that makes a little difference hopefully
it does because I think they're really
cute then last but not least I went to
free people and I've got if it'll come
out of the wrapping this denim skirt
another one I got it in a size 27 and it
just looks like that has buttons all
over the top and it's just dressed and
it's high-waisted I think it's really
cute just for when I travel over the
summer and stuff I think that'll be
really cute so I have to put all this
stuff away I also have a ton of clothes
in here letting me show you guys for
another haul yeah all this stuff I got
all that from forever 21 and it's all
under $200 for like a ton of stuff so
I'm gonna be doing like a 100 $200
spring clothing haul but I've just been
so sick I couldn't do any of that so I
have all that stuff waiting in there and
then I just want to show you guys this
stuff that I bought today in this vlog
just because I have so many sit down
house so do I didn't wanna like put all
this stuff into a sit down haul just
because it was kind of like random
miscellaneous items that didn't really
have a purpose and then I also have a
ton of stuff right here that I just got
from princess Polly that I'm gonna be
doing a huge haul for like this oh my
god I can't even like show you guys all

my favorite store of all time and they
sent me a really cute note in the mail

going on so many vacations and all the
Instagram pictures are gonna be
literally filled with all of these
clothes they're my favorite clothing
store all-time I love them so much
and I'm like so lucky that I get to work
with princess Polly just because like
one of the first companies that I wanted
to work with like right when I started
my youtube channel was princess Polly
just cuz like I've loved them for so
long and I think it was back in June or
maybe no it was in July or August but it

remember I reached out to them
and I send them an email and I was like

it all the time I would love to like
work with you guys and do like a haul

they said no so I was just like oh okay
like whatever I'm just gonna keep buying
clothes for now because I love them so
much and then when they reached out to
me and wanted to work with me I was like
oh my god like it was one of the best
things ever and like I'm so lucky that I
got that opportunity and it's all
