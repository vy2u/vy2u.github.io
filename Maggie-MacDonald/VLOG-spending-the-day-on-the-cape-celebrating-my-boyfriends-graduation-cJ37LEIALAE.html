over
I'm with Emma at home in her room right

different than mine daddy read me

cute me too I like the one you yeah
they're so cute damn how are we gonna
know who's who's one might one size
bigger sure I really like them hey my
dogs are going crazy just as soon as I
start filming but I just caught up not
like a little while ago actually maybe
it was like a long time ago I got a bit
for because I okay that's on psycho but
I couldn't sleep last name like past
four because I went to bed so early that
I woke up at four and it wasn't tired by
definitely closing my eyes and like
laying until 5:30 when Emma got up for
school and then
like gone up with her and I made
breakfast and I had coffee and like
talked to my dad for a while and stuff
and now it's like 7:45 and I'm gonna go
for a run but I just wanted to like
check in and start my day off on the
vlog since I'm gonna be vlogging all day
today but I'm going for a run and this
is what I'm wearing I'm wearing this
Lululemon sports bra which are my
favorite right now have them linked up
below and these pants these are the ones
that I wear to SoulCycle if you guys
haven't watched my blog for a while you
would know that like I released a soul
cycle every time I don't know what
they're called I'll link them as well
but I'm gonna be wearing my oh my god my
dogs are going crazy I'm gonna be
wearing my APL sneakers for the first
time to run and I guess they're like
really good for I think the painters are
here painting our house but I think that
these thinkers are really good for
running I guess like that's what I read
about them I've never ran and them
before but I've done like other types of
workouts I really like them they're so
comfy so I'll let you guys know after my
run like how they are and stuff like
that and I'm using my off watch today
you start using this thing more I feel
like I like don't really use it as much
because I haven't been doing I nearly
put my camera somewhere so I can talk
and put this on but I haven't been doing
like types of workouts where I'm gonna
use it I like using it for running and I
haven't really ran in a while but since
I'm on the Cape I like to like over runs
outside and stuff just because the air
is so fresh and clean and like we have
this really cool like mile trail thing
behind my house so I usually do that
twice and I'll run for like little less
than 20 minutes and I'll do like two
miles and it's a group
good workout and I just feel like it I
don't know it just really gets me going
and everyone's always like do you lift
like what do you do for workouts and
personally cardio is my favorite
I just got back from my run and I just
took a shower and I like realized I
haven't actually ran in a while like I
was saying before I can't wait to be
home when the Cape for the summer just
because I love to run and I like to go
for a run every morning and I just feel
like it makes me feel so much better
like I was sitting after my run this
morning and I felt like so like out of
shape because I work out but I don't do
anything that like is the same as it is
if you like actually go for a run so I
can't wait to start running again but
right now I just got dressed I'm wearing
this brandy melville little white
t-shirt with this Calvin Klein brought
light under it and these forever21
joggers they're actually emilie's
because my brandy melville joggers are
in the dryer right now I put them on
like air dry because the girl that works
at brandy told me that you shouldn't dry
them because that's why they get pili
and stuff and that's like the reason why
I had to get a new pair because my ghost
old pili
so I was gonna make a spinach and egg
omelet and the eggs same 1/10 on that I
don't know if you can see and this says
May 5 May 5th so I don't know like what
Emma's doing or if she like ever eats
her groceries but but foods bad so I
can't eat it so no I don't know what to
do
there's a literally no food because
we're going to remove on Wednesday so
there's like no food in our house right
now my dad was like all like try not to
buy any fruits and vegetables and stuff
because we're gonna be leaving and it's
just all gonna go to waste so I wish I
could make food and show you guys
because my kitchen got redone so this is
what it looks like you probably would
have seen it in one of my other vlogs
when I came home for Easter but I don't
know everything's just so like clean and
like fresh and they need to go throw the
other way if it looks disgusting
I have to improvise right now because
everything was bad at my house so I'm
gonna have this cottage cheese on top of
a piece of Ezekiel bread I'm gonna go
meet my mom for a smoothie now because I
haven't seen her in a really long time
but I changed my pants because I was
wearing Emma's forever 21 once and then
I found her pretty mouth little ones
she's a Mi'kmaq you why are you wearing
all my clothes oh my god so annoying
but I'm gonna go meet her now and I just
have my little backpack with me this
thing honestly holds so much I'm so glad
that I have it so I'm gonna go ahead and
do that now and then I finally start my
day and start doing errands it's only
ten o'clock and I feel like I've been up
for so long well because I have but I
don't know I feel like I've gotten so
much done already like I can't wait for
this summer because I can't wait to like
get up early and get my day started and
like get after it
I've had such a busy and crazy day now
it's the afternoon in this morning I
told you guys I was going to get a
smoothie my mom and so I did that and
then I where did I go after that oh I I
was on FaceTime a Tyler like for a while
after that because I like obviously
wasn't with him Austin because I was
home so we face hung for a while in the
parking lot and then I got lunch I got a
burrito and I didn't film and then I
also went to my sister I don't know I
just called her my sister I went to
Emma's friend store and I bought a bunch
of stuff I'll show you guys but I need
to run inside my house right now and go
get all my stuff to go back to my
apartment my grandfather's in there so I
don't want to like film inside of my
grandpa's there because I feel like he
wouldn't like know like what I'm doing I
don't know but um so I did that and then
have my dentist which went really really
well I'm sorry that I have Tilly tell
you guys what a Jedi should have showed
you but it wasn't really anything about
exciting except for the store but I was
literally the only person in there so I
kind of felt like awkward filming well
not like awkward I don't feel awkward
filming but it just I don't want to be
like talking to myself like talking to
the camera when it was only me and the
guy that was work
there and so yeah but now I need to head
back to school I'm going to dinner with
Tyler Kyle and their parents tonight
which would be really really fun it's so
nice out today and I'm excited to go
back to perch water because I really
want Marylou's there's no Marylou's on
Cape so nobody nice to go back and
finally get a coffee
I made one this morning with the coffee
that Emma really likes I didn't really
like it that much
I want banana nut but yeah and it's
supposed to rain tomorrow and I'm really
sad because I was graduating and that
kind of ruins my whole outfit plan so
now I don't know what's weird he just
got ready to go out to dinner with
Tyler's family and I'll show you might
open in a second like when I put my
shoes on and stuff but I just wanted to
end off the volcker is gonna be the last
time that I vlog for the night and I
wanted to show you guys what I got from
Palomar just because I told you guys I'm
gonna show you in a little mini hall
when I got home oh I got these necklaces
actually I mean earrings oh my thought I
thought one fellow I couldn't see it
this one is a lightning bolt and then
this one is just a gold bar and I'm
wearing the same ones on that side and
then I also got this little top right
here and it's just a nude like ribbed I
don't even know how to describe it um
shoot like sweater material kind of like
a little cami and I think that that's
really really cute so I'm excited to
wear that summer oh and I also got these
genes from revolve I exchange them for
bigger size and they are the friend
girlfriend they're so cute they're
high-waisted and they have a little bot
rep but they literally don't fit over my
butt and I don't know what to do because
I got a bigger size and they just like
don't fit at all so I'm gonna have to
return those altogether because they
were really expensive and then I put the
shorts that I got in my closet where are
they oh here they are
who's calling
Tyra's face having you one second hello
hi oh yeah okay sorry about that so I
got these Levi's shorts and they are
just these vintage high-waisted Levi's
and normally I cannot find any denim
shorts that fit me and these ones
literally fit perfectly their size
3000 I don't know like what that means
because I know all of the Levi's like
run really differently because some of
them fit me and like some of them don't
I didn't have never known like what size
I am in them since they're like men's
jeans and they're like I don't know I
really don't know how they run but these
are what I got what else did I get
oh I got a necklace and it's in here
it's really really cute I'm excited to
wear with like a plain white t-shirt and
the Levi's shorts and he's a little I'll
show you the shoes I want to wear with
it I want to wear these so these shoes
with Levi's a white shirt and then this
choker yeah it's like a reddish orange
coral colored choker okay so I'm finally
all ready and I'm in the process of
packing up all of my stuff to go home
since I'm going to Aruba
Wednesday May 16th and then I come home
the 23rd and I go to post Malone with
Tyler the 24th and then I have a few
days in between that and then going
Italy so I'm bringing all of my clothes
literally everything that I have in my
closet is coming home with me and going
in my closet at home just because it
would like mess everything up if
everything was here and I like was gonna
be at home for the summer like I need to
just bring all at home all of us coming
home all this stuff all this stuff on my
bed all these boxes are coming with me
over here like my room is so messy right
now well it's messy for me just like
with all this clutter everywhere and
it's freaking me out and I have so many
bathing suits in here I think like 15
bathing suits and I'm bringing them all
to Aruba
well not 15 probably like 10 and I'm
bringing them all to Aruba and I have a
call for you guys that I'm gonna be
doing there and I know you guys loved my
affordable bikini also I'm gonna be
doing another one of those and I think
I'm gonna bring my little black Gucci
backpack with me tonight instead of my
white bag I don't know I just feel like
with this outfit I'm wearing it goes a
lot better than my white bag even though
my wife bag is more of an evening bag
and that one's more like daytime but I
don't know okay I don't know if I can
roll up at dinner with a backpack on I
don't know if this is the right vibe but
anyway this is my outfit I'm wearing
this black princess Polly cropped little
cami that you guys saw in my princess
Polly Hall have my princess Polly Hall
actually linked down below if you guys
haven't seen it I bought a ton of
clothes for Europe and I actually wasn't
gonna wear this outfit tonight because I
am gonna save it for when I go to Italy
in London but I didn't like the outfit
that I originally planned and these are
also princess Polly pants and I'm
wearing it with these shoes from
Nordstrom they're just plain nude heels
and then I have my gold necklaces from
forever 21 and my little dainty cold
earrings that I just showed you guys
from Pei Lamar so this is my outfit for
tonight just super casual and chill and
comfortable which is like my vibe but I
have to get ready to go so I think I'm
gonna add off the vlog here because
Tyler said he was gonna come at 6:30 at
6:28 but I'm also wearing minimal makeup
tonight and I think I found out why I've
been breaking out because it looks a lot
better and honestly this is disgusting
and I could I came and think about it
but I know what like caused it but it
makes more puke
so I use the Kat Von D shade and light
palette as my contour and it's literally
right where I contour and it's from the
palette and I googled it online and I
like rather reviews
I googled Kat Von D shade light palette
like causing breakouts and this one girl
had a review and it she gave it one star
and she was like I got this palette I'm
so obsessed with it because everybody
else like was using it it looks so good
so I wanted to try it out and I used it
and then I started to get little bumps
on my face which I noticed that I had
little bumps in California but like they
were nothing so I just ignored them I
didn't touch them or anything like that
because like they weren't like pimples
they weren't probable they were
literally just like raised bumps on my
face and then I remember being at the
Super Bowl and being like why are these
bumps getting bigger and I got the
palette for Christmas so anyway I read
the review and the girl said that she
started off with little bumps on her
face and then gradually like as she kept
using the palette they turned into like
a cluster like 10:00 to 11:00 she said
of like cystic acne pimples and that's
what I have on my face is absolutely
disgusting and all the reason why I hate
wearing makeup but it's almost summer
night thankfully don't have to wear
makeup anywhere I only wear bronzer
usually during the summer and a little
bit of blush and the bronzer uses either
hoola or the chocolate to face bronzer
and then I use my Tarte blush which has
never like done anything wrong to my
face so I'm gonna keep doing that during
this summer but I'm gonna end off the
vlog here just because I don't know if
I'm gonna ever vlog I got dinner
probably I'm not gonna blog at dinner I
might bring my camera a little bit and
like Kylie and I would like say hi but I
probably won't vlog at dinner at all so
I just want to end off the vlog here and
you guys so so much for watching
hopefully you guys enjoyed this video
and I will see you in my next one bye
