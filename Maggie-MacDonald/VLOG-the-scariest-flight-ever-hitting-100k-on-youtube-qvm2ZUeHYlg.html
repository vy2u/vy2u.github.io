gave our bags and I got our tax returns
and everything done and we're they
getting such a rush to leave for the
airport and I had another issue with my
earphones and I wouldn't left by the
airport so Airport I mean at the hotel
in my bad night like remember putting
them on the bed and I was like before I
went to bed last night it was really
weird cuz I was like oh well I camped in
the applause like I know I won't forget
them and then I ended up getting them so
that's really annoying but we just
stopped at this little juice place it's
so cool because the police is at the
airport to eat are so much better than
they are in the States
this is like fresh-squeezed juice and
like croissants and stuff and smoothies
and they literally make it all for you
like you can see like they have juicers
and there's a guy in the back doing it
and they have all the fresh produce over
there like I wish that they have to take
this out of home cuz I think whenever I
travel I'm always eating the worst stuff
and then I feel really sick
so yeah so funny they literally just
hand you the croissant a little napkin
it's like so casual and everyone just
stands around well there used to be a
lot of people here but everyone just
kind of stands around eat circus on sand
drinks are juice
this is my orange juice
it's so good but they gave me a little
cup and then they gave crush on that big
one baby because you got lemons orange
and grapefruit but it's so good
so I solved my problem and I got some
headphones at the airport I just got the
Apple regular ones because they have a
little adapter that can fit into my
phone right here so I got those thank
god I could get like headphones like
that for the plane I actually love the
Apple headphones I know some people
don't like them but I love them and then
we got some food before you leave I got
a caprese panini and then also a coffee
so we're gonna eat this and then we're
gonna go find our gate and little while
and I'm glad because we have and I'm
really good because we have like so much
time I'm like slipping off of this couch
right here because we have so much time
before we like have to get our flight so
we had a lot of time to walk around and
like do stuff and get waters without a
little breakfast when we showed up
oh my god we literally have had the
longest like day ever so you guys know
we left Rome this morning and then
landed in Montreal at 2:30 and so that's
like why my hair is a mess I had
literally been traveling all day so I
just want to tell you guys about like
what happened on a flight you guys
probably would have seen Gretchen's
Instagram post but we were on the plane
and I was like so relaxed for the first
I think it was like three hours of the
plane you guys know like I lost my ear
pods and I have to get some headphones
and I was listening to the Gossip Girl
series on audible just via scratch was
like Maggie like watch these movies with
me like I'm gonna download a bunch of
movies and a bunch of TV shows and you
guys know that like I don't really like
movies and I don't really like watch
some TV like I just can't sit still and
like watch something I don't know why I
just like my mind races and I think of
50 different things I literally need to
I like have headphones in close my eyes
and like just sit there and then I'm
like listening to my book everything's
great and literally we thought that the
plane was gonna like I don't even want
to say this because I'm scared because
you're going on another flight right now
knock on wood oh my god it was a
scariest moment of my whole entire life
we were sitting on the plane and I like
took one of my headphones out and I was
like I'm saying something to Gretchen
and then all of a sudden we heard this
big loud like noise coming from like the
bottom of the plane I don't know if it
was because we were like in the back
were like what it was but we just kept
hearing this really loud noise and we
were like what is that and then all of a
sudden the plane was like going going
going and it literally would like drop
and then it would come back up and it
would drop and then it would like to the
left and to the right and it was just
like insane like turbulence mixed with
this sound that we've never heard and it
was so crazy and we were both sitting
there like literally crying and like
shaking and holding hands I was like
Gretchen are we gonna be okay are we
gonna be okay I don't know what to do
and she was like Maggie like I don't
know what to do either
right is she saying or were you know
okay I was like maybe we're not okay and
I felt so good I literally was like my
heart was racing and the first thing I
thought of was that if like I had Wi-Fi
literally texted
Kaleigh my mom my dad my brother my
sister like all my other friends and I
would have just been like guys like I'm
so scared of the play right now like if
something bad happens just know that I
love you like that's how bad it was so
yeah that was really awful and then like
for the rest of the flight it like
wasn't as bad but I'm still really like
shocked about what happened
I like sit with my eyes closed and
breathe and relax and yeah but that was
a lot and so now it's 534 and we are
boarding our claim in 10 minutes to go
back to Boston and it's felt like people
always say ever guys look where I am
I'm in my room in Bridgewater at my
apartment and I'm just trying to like
unpack some stuff and do some laundry
just because I'm going to Tyler's
tomorrow but yeah so I'm gonna go take a
shower and get in bed because it's
really really late it literally is 9:25
so it's 3:25 in the morning I'm gonna go
to bed now but I will be vlogging
tomorrow so I will see you guys morning
guys so I just got to Boston and I am
gonna do SoulCycle so I literally like
woke up this morning and I woke up
before my alarm which is really funny
because I thought it was gonna be so
tired like not be able to get up for it
so I set an alarm for 9 I ended up
getting up at like 7 o'clock and then I
went back to bed for an hour and then I
woke up by myself at like 8:00 8:15 then
I got ready a lot of coffee from
Starbucks came to Boston and I had to
get new SoulCycle leggings because I
didn't pack any leggings for Italy and
then I literally just like went to my
apartment I was like oh my god if I'm
gonna go to SoulCycle in the morning how
am I gonna go if I don't have leggings
so I had to come a little bit early and
go to Lululemon to get some new leggings
I don't show you guys when they got out
of the car but I'm gonna start walking
over now just because of class starts in
15 minutes and I'm taking a class with
Lisa this morning and I'm really excited
and these are the leggings that I got
they're just my SoulCycle leggings that
you guys know I love but I got them in
like an army green color so I'll have
these ones linked down below for you
guys they are my absolute favorite and I
also have my favorite white sports you
guys know like these as well I just
finished up at Seoul and it was
literally the best class ever
now I'm posting a little instrument
story you can't really see it but I just
got dig in and I got broccoli some
greens on the bottom tofu and a sweet
potato that's somewhere underneath like
it literally got like oh wait this is
the sweet potato yeah I got tofu sweet
potato broccoli and then greens
underneath and then sriracha sauce and
it's literally so gonna haven't been in
did you dig it in a while and if you
guys are ever in the Boston area
literally come here because it's kind of
like sweet green but like different you
can like make your own bowls and stuff
in there all make and warm and have like
fresh tofu and check in you can get
salmon you can literally get whatever
you want it's so good I'm walking in my
car right now and it's super windy so I
hope you'll be able to hear me but I
write 12 o'clock when I leave my car
because they come out at 12
yeah to pay my parking I knew it was
gonna be here I'm so mad about whatever
I literally knew that I was gonna get a
ticket but I mean it's $25 so I'm gonna
have to pay that I'm literally like so
hot right now
and I feel like hazy I don't know I just
like don't feel good right now I think
I'm like super jet-lagged and I like
don't think I eat enough like before
SoulCycle so I just like feel super sick
now I have to go to Newberry Street
which is just like one Street over from
where I am right now and I have to bring
Gretchen her bag with her a scarf her
Gucci scarf and then like her jewelry
that she bought in Italy because she
left them in my carry-on and I was like
oh my god I have like all of Gretchen's
stuff so I should probably give it back
to her and she happened to be on
Newberry getting her hair done like
today and I'm leaving Seoul so I'm gonna
go bring her all of that stuff and then
I'm gonna head to North handover and
spend the night with Tyler oh I mean
like sit for a second though because I
like feels super lightheaded so I just
dropped off Gretchen's bag and I saw her
in Louisa and we like plan to go to
SoulCycle tomorrow so it's like
Gretchen's and I just came back from
obviously our trip to Italy and then
like I saw her today I'm gonna see her
again tomorrow and then I think we're
doing so like the next like three days
so it's so funny we literally were like
booking all of our bikes this morning
and so if we're taking so many soul
classes her in Luiza literally booked 18
SoulCycle classes this week before she
goes to Italy she's doing like a bunch
of doubles I'm sorry I'm like talking
with gum in my mouth right now but yeah
I know people like a when I do that but
I didn't mean to but I'm gonna go get my
eyebrows studded at Boston threading our
Newberry just because they're like so
bad
and my eyelashes are so bad - I
literally don't have any eyelashes I
don't know if you guys can see but like
all right here it's like all empty so I
have my eyelashes on Friday and I'm
doing eyebrows and nails today so I'm
emanating well now and I just tried on
this dress and it's so cute and it's
just like a plain simple little t-shirt
dress with little ties and then I'm also
gonna get this bra that with like these
bunch of underwear and then they're also
I'm getting the same thing just in this
new color because I like how they go
longer and their lace and I just think
they're super cute like under a v-neck
like white t-shirt with some denim
shorts and like cool sandals yeah so I
think I'm gonna get that stuff and then
I'm also gonna get this because I have
like a bigger version and I really like
it so I'm gonna get this one like when I
make up when I just bring around like a
few things yeah so I'm so excited to get
all these things are super cute and I'm
gonna be showing him in a haul video
soon I have like a bunch of stuff that I
recently bought that are gonna like put
together all in one I'm back now in the
car I was gonna bring my camera with me
- wait I'm taking out my gum this is
annoying um so anyway I just got my
nails done and I got this really nice
like neutral nude color I'll show you
and it's by D and D and I think it's
called Havana cream that's what it's
called and then I got this really bright
pink color on my toes that just looks
like that and honestly I feel like it's
a little too bright for me right now but
whatever it's fine I feel like your toes
like no one really notices anyway so I'm
just gonna deal with that but I just got
my nails done like I said and I'm
waiting for my phone to charge because
I'm gonna go to Tyler's house right now
and I'm getting my nails done in his
town and I just like went to a random
place I typed into my GPS and it brought
me there but I don't know how to get to
his house from here and I don't really
go the wrong way if I get lost so I have
to wait for my phone to charge so and
then I can GPS at my way to his house
and yeah so that is what I did and guys
I hit 100k on YouTube but and I'm so
happy and I like literally all day Tyler
and Gretchen like everybody had been
texting me like oh my god you're so
close like saying all that stuff and I
was driving and then I was stuck in
traffic for awhile like literally
stopped on the highway so I was like you
know what I like one of my phone to
check it and I like one on YouTube and I
clicked on it and I had 100k and I was
all by myself and it was so sad I don't
know but then I was just like so happy
and like made me really emotional and
then Gretchen called me and I don't know
I just I'm like so like I can't believe
it and I'm so happy and like thankful
and grateful and I don't know I just
like oh it all to you guys because
without you guys I would not be where I
am it's just like makes me so happy and
like I don't know I just feel like I say
this all the time but literally if you
want to do something in the world or
like do something that you love like
there's no way that you wouldn't be able
to do it like my best friend Molly
texted me was like Maggie I'm so happy
for you I'm so proud of you like you
literally took your dream and you made
it a reality
so if I can do it so can you the top
being said everybody just go out there
and do what you love
and I swear like if you just stop caring
about what people think of you and like
stop doing like what everybody thinks is
like the norm then you'll just be so
much happier and like I don't know
that's my rant</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
