here we go
hey everyone welcome back to my channel
in today's video day four of my 30-day
challenge I am going to be showing you
everything that I ate today and I'm
gonna go all the way from breakfast to
dinner I am in college I am a junior in
college and these are just all of my
meals that I ate throughout the day I'm
gonna include every little thing and
show you exactly what it is I will also
leave a detailed list in the description
box down below these are just the things
that I eat on a typical day again
everybody's body is different this is
what works out best for me and the
portions that I normally eat but nobody
is going to be the same this is just
what personally works out for me and
what I like to eat if you are interested
in seeing what I eat in a typical day in
college then just keep on watching this
video give this video a thumbs up if you
want to see more what I eat in a daze
and without further ado let's get
started to start off the day I am just
going to be having two pieces of the
sprouted cinnamon raisin Ezekiel bread
with two scrambled eggs and I usually
just get the cage-free eggs from Trader
Joe's I don't really think it matters
which eggs you get but these are just
the ones that I like when I cook
anything on a pan I just like to use the
coconut oil spray from Trader Joe's just
so it doesn't stick and it's easy to
cook and if you see on the back of the
nutrition label there are no additives
no nothing so that's why I like to use
the coconut oil spray rather than
anything else so I highly recommend that
if you have a Trader Joe's near you that
you go out and get this because I'm not
kidding you guys it is a life changer
this is my finished breakfast I just
have again two scrambled eggs and I put
some fresh ground pepper on it and then
I have my toasted cinnamon raisin
Ezekiel bread along with some black iced
coffee and then just a water so I can
hydrate before starting the day
so this is what I had for breakfast and
now I'm gonna go to class I have costs
from 8:00 a.m. to 10:45 so this will
hold me over until I'm out of class
so I just got back from my class and I'm
making lunch okay
I'm gonna make one of these whole wheat
English muffins from Trader Joe's and
I'm gonna put peanut butter and sliced
banana on it and honestly I don't really
have that much food to make lunch right
now at my apartment so this is like my
go-to and for my favorite things to eat
they seriously eat one of these every
single day they're my fave so I'm gonna
make that right now and then like I have
a ton of stuff to do so like I'm kind of
in a rush but I will show you the
finished product when it is done I'm
going to get my lunch already now first
I'm gonna just obviously peel my banana
and then I'm going to cut it up into
little small pieces like this and I'm
only gonna use half of it then I'm gonna
take my favorite peanut butter it is the
Trader Joe's unsalted crunchy peanut
butter and they don't know why some
focus enough is the bomb it's my
favorite I love it you will not go back
to eating any other peanut butter after
you dry this one I swear to God so I
just take a little bit of that and I'll
spread it on my warm English muffin and
then do it again to the other one let's
get a little more
baby so once I'm done with that then I'm
gonna start taking the little slices of
banana just putting them on top I start
with four on each of them
and then if I have extra I'll just place
them on top like this so I am all done
so this is what I'm gonna have for lunch
also another tip that I have and that is
to put your peanut butter or almond
butter whichever one you prefer in the
fridge because the one that I use from
Trader Joe's the unsalted crunchy peanut
butter when you open it up it has no
other additives so it separates and the
oil goes to the top and then the actual
peanut butters are on the bottom so you
do have to stir it together before you
use it so after every single time that I
use it I just put it back in the fridge
and it'll harden and make it so that
they don't separate and then when you
put it on a warm English muffin like I
did here it just melts really nicely and
it's honestly just so good so I'm gonna
eat this and then I have a bunch of
errands to do today but the next thing
that I eat obviously I will show you
guys so I will check back in with you
later
and yeah hey guys so I just got back
from running around all day I ran some
errands I ended up having to go to a
town that's like a half an hour away
from where my school is because I got a
nail in my tire so I had to go get that
fixed and then while I was waiting for
my car they were like oh well you have
to wait like an hour to an hour and a
half so I was with one of my friends and
we didn't know what else to do so we
just went to the mall and did some
shopping while we were waiting but in
the meantime we did end up getting lunch
and I've ended up bringing it home
and just waiting till I got home because
I didn't have my camera with me and I
wanted to show you guys exactly what I
got
we just went to Whole Foods and I got a
little salad and I put it in this one of
our little cardboard container things
that they have at their salad bar and
personally I love a whole food salad bar
it's one of my favorite places to go for
lunch if I just want something quick and
it's super healthy and if you read the
little labels above where the food is
they tell you all the ingredients that
go into it which I really love so I just
want to show you what I got
so this is what I got from the whole
food salad bar I put some baby kale and
spinach on the bottom and then on the
top I just have some grilled peppers and
grilled zucchini and squash over here
and then in the middle I have grilled
asparagus and then on the side right
here I just have like a little tomato
and mozzarella and basil mix and then
underneath all of that I do have chicken
it's so important to have protein with
every single meal it's gonna help you be
a lot more full and having protein is so
good for you so today I chose to get
chicken on my salad but you could also
get things like salmon or shrimp
anything like that whatever you like
would also work and so yeah this is what
I got and I also got this health aid
kombucha right here and the flavor is
Cayenne cleanse it's one of my favorite
kombucha ever I love this brand I love
this flavor it's really spicy it's kind
of an acquired taste and this if you've
ever heard of kombucha it's just an
all-natural probiotic tea and is
fermented I also got a Mexican wedding
cookie from Whole Foods because I needed
something like to hold me over before I
got home and I got to like eat this
because I wanted to show you guys what I
got so yeah I also got that and yeah
right now I am just going to eat my
salad and then get ready to go to the
gym and then when I get home from the
gym I'm gonna do some editing and stuff
and then I
well cook my dinner and I will be back
to show you guys what I'm making later I
just got back from the gym and for
dinner I ended up having the rest of my
salad that I got from Whole Foods
earlier because there was just like a
little bit of spinach and kale and
chicken left but I added some jasmine
rice and also some green beans to it and
then that's what I had but I would show
it to you it was kind of like messy
looking and looked really disgusting and
plus I already ate it so yeah I just
wanted to let you guys know that that's
what I had for dinner after my workout I
was so hungry after my workout I posted
the whole entire workout that I did
today on my Instagram story so if you
are following me on Instagram you should
totally check that out and if not my
