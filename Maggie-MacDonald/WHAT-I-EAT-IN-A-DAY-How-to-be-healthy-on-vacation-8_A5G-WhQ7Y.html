today's video is going to be a lot
different than my other vlogs from the
trip I just feel like instead of showing
you guys what I'm doing throughout the
day and just like vlogging my day I
decided that I was gonna do a what I eat
in a day on vacation and how I stay
healthy on vacation because at least for
me I know that when you're on vacation
think there's so many good foods all the
time and it's like so basically I know
how hard it is to eat healthy and stay
healthy on vacation so today I am going
to show you guys how I see healthy on
vacation and I just thought that it
would be interesting to do like a what I
eat in a day on vacation so that's
exactly what I'm gonna do I'm going to
be showing you guys everything I'm
eating today bringing you guys along
with me and still showing you parts of
my day but really focusing on what I am
eating so I hope you guys enjoy this
video if you're new please hit that
subscribe button and without further
adieu let's get started
today's Breakfast is spinach and tomato
omelette and then I got a bunch of
different fruits
I love the cut-up great fruit that they
have at this resort and then also I got
grapes obviously and then honey doom and
that's what ever got hardened isotopes
and and then of course Eman I got little
mini pancakes to share just because when
you're on vacation it's always nice to
have some balance
lunch today is at the same place that we
ate out for breakfast just as a
restaurant that's right next to the
beach area and also the pool which is
back behind me I don't know if you guys
can see it's already back there lunch
with the best view on the island but
it's kind of cool because we can just
sit here in our towels and we just went
swimming and now we're gonna cool off
for that and just eat some lunch and be
underneath the shady just because it's
so hot today and we're gonna plan on
staying outside a little bit longer
right now it 2:38 and usually we go
inside around like 3:00 3:30 and work
out but today we're just gonna stay
outside longer we're finally eating
lunch we haven't been hungry that's kind
of weird
usually if we get hungry around the
clock
later this right here is what we got
yesterday it's the Mediterranean veggie
wrap in the house mixed greens and red
pepper hummus and feta and that was
really really good we got fruit on the
side right there but I think today
I'm gonna get one of the salads just
because they're super late and a lot of
these have really good proteins on top
like tuna quinoa steak and you can even
add grilled chicken and seared tuna and
then shrimp as well having like a salad
with a lot of veggies and fruits is
going to be very nutritious for you
because like if we're being real this is
what I would want a margarita pizza but
I know that I'm not gonna be full for
that long and it has no like nutritional
value so I know it's just gonna make me
end up feeling really sick and bloated
for the rest of the day so I want
something else in the fuel so I'm gonna
pick out one of these yummy salads right
here this is all I know
this is Major see about a la vibes for
our appetizer
we got burrata and that's the type of
cheese that's on it I think it's like a
mold Sorella and then it has fresh
tomatoes with in olive oil and then I
think the balsamics like an aged
balsamic and it comes with these little
pieces of classified this is really
really really good you heard it all from
the experts outfits about just regular
bread and I'll just regular mozzarella
so I'm gonna olive oil
I'm sorry this lighting is so bad but
look at the inside of the mozzarella
that's why I guess it's not regular
mozzarella
it's burrata because it's like really
really soft I'm good and I guess if
you're pregnant you can eat this kind of
mozzarella cheese because of like how
it's made and stuff because my favorite
bloggers see paella eats this and she is
pregnant right now and she's having a
baby
look how good that looks and we both
ended up going with the citrus and
seared tuna salad and this two tuna is
perfectly cooked
I love how the tops of it has like a
seasoning and can't wait to try it this
looks so good I love when I have citrus
on my vows it's one of my favorite
things
and for dinner we're out to the
restaurant called the lobby and it's in
the lobby at a hotel and look how good
this venue looks they have a bunch of
different flat breads and sandwiches and
desserts salads and appetizers and the
other night the salad I got was the
Caribbean salad has mixed greens avocado
strawberries mango cherry tomatoes
shrimp and guava dress it's so good this
vibe is so cool about the bar area that
we saw it the other day if you guys saw
on the VC blogs and then this is just
like this is big a long table that you
can eat dinner out like they have menus
all over it so we decided to sit here in
the lobbies huge and it's like so a
study for me pleasing and I took an
Instagram picture on a couch it looks
like about the other day actually it was
that couch right there
Oh insert the picture right here if you
guys want to see it so you get like a
perspective of what the hotel looks like
and that's the Starbucks that we go to
every day but yeah oh and if you're not
following me on Instagram you guys
totally should be well I mean you talk
to but I'll have a link down below but
we're gonna order off of this menu I
don't know why we have a drink menu
because we're drinking water gotta
hydrate while you're on vacation and
clearly Emma and I are just to impress
hey we got these really comfy yeah we
got these really comfy t-shirt store the
other night and there are this really
soft material and they just say rube on
them then we got them like to sleep in
and this is the dinner for tonight we're
starting off with the hummus and this
like pita bread it's really thin and
then obviously it has celery and this is
our dinner part and we're having a
barbecue chicken flatbread and what's
good about flatbread is that it's so
thin that it's not as filling as pizza
and it doesn't make you feel as like
gross info and also on top of the
chicken is a good a source of protein
and also the hummus is as well so we're
gonna be having this for dinner and you
guys know we're gonna have to get
dessert after those because it's
balanced
we're on a mission for dessert we're
going to this restaurant right here the
one that we ate breakfast and lunch at
and to end of the night I got gelato
I'm I got cookies and cream whipped
cream rainbow sprinkles and nuts I got
chocolate with Snickers and whipped
cream honestly I didn't know what to get
because I wanted Oreo on top and the
other day when we got Oreo it was like
stale because of how human it is so I
was like I don't know what to get I have
like a chocolate craving I guess I
usually never eat chocolate ice cream so
I just got into bed it and I'm gonna end
off the vlog here cuz I'm gonna go to
sleep but I just got this big water from
the gift shop downstairs it's just a
giant Fiji water it's one in half liters
which if you drink two of those that's
like the amount of water that I like to
drink in a day I like to drink 3 liters
of water so I got that water because I'm
gonna drink some before bed and stay
hydrated because I know I'm gonna
workout in the morning but I just want
to end up over like here because I'm
gonna go to sleep now
