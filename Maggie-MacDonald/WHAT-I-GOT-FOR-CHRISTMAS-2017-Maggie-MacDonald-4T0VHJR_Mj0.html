Merry Christmas I cannot believe that it
is Christmas already like it's insane I
can't believe dis summer flew by so fast
so as you can see by the title today I
am going to be showing you guys what I
got for Christmas and just like
everybody else on YouTube like a little
disclaimer before I get started I am so
thankful for everything that I got this
year I was not expecting to get what I
got I am so happy and honestly Christmas
really isn't about like the gifts that
you get and receive and give it's mostly
about like spending time with family and
friends and just making sure that
everybody is happy and healthy I really
think that that is what's most important
this Christmas definitely not all the
material items so without further ado
let's get started with what I got for
Christmas so to start off with the
smaller items first Emma just got me
this book and it's called Rosie all day
in the essential guide at tear and new
favorite wine because as you guys know I
just turned 21
back in November and I'm literally
obsessed with Rosie like it's my
favorite drink right now so imma just
got me this cute little book and I think
it is from Anthropologie but it's so
cute like you just can look through and
like read about all the different types
of wine and stuff like that so that was
super cute Thank You Emma and then I
just got a few little stocking stuffer
items from Anthropologie I got this
little pinkish rose gold keychain just
to hook onto my little Louie Vuitton
card holder because I love having
different little fun keychains on my
wallet
and this one's super cute Emma also got
a matching one too so that'll be cute
that both of us each have like an
eminent E then I got this lip balm it's
amazing oh my god I've tried this out in
the store and I never got it because
honestly it was kind of sensitive and I
was like you know what like I'm not
gonna buy that I don't need it but to
get for Christmas something like this is
so perfect I don't know I just think
that it's something
I normally wouldn't have bought with my
own money so to get it as a gift it
meant so much more to me and it is just
the Llano lips multi-purpose super bomb
and it's hydrating nourishing and super
intense I don't know I love it it's
super hydrating and nourishing like it
said on the box on your lips like I have
it on right now and it kind of gives you
like a little shimmer which I really
like and then the next thing I got is
just in this Anastacio lip gloss and it
is in the shade punchy red look at this
color guys it's literally amazing I
cannot wait to wear this I might do like
a New Year's Eve inspired makeup look if
that's something that you guys would be
interested interested in just give this
video a thumbs up I definitely love this
and it's gonna be so good - we're going
out you guys know that I love a bold lip
color and then I just got this free
people bralette it's super cute it's one
of their seamless intimates free people
line bralette thingy and it just has
like these little holes and detailing on
the front which is super cute I don't
know if I got this from Santa as a
message like Maggie you need to wear a
bra because I literally don't worry
about as I hate bras so to have this bra
that I mean I guess it's cute like I can
wear it like layer it with like loose
shirts and things like that so yeah and
then I got me Kat Von D shade and light
palette I have heard so much about this
palette and I got the knot cream one
what's it called the powder hi mother I
got the powder shade and light palette
by Kat Von D and look at this guy's oh
my god you know I'm team fed TBD but I'm
gonna have to try this out I think that
it's so perfect just to have all the
different like shades in there for when
you're tan when you're not things I
thought this is definitely gonna come in
super handy okay so then I just got a
bunch of clothes honestly it was like a
me Christmas like you guys know that I
love like comfy casual athleisure
clothes
that's my style so that is exactly what
I got so the first thing I got is just
this corrupt Tommy Hilfiger sweatshirt
and it is the Tommy sport line and it's
super cute it just has a big th on the
front it's gray
you guys know Gray's the most companies
color ever so I'm so excited that I got
this I cannot wait to wear it with like
leggings and sneakers things like that I
know I'm gonna be getting a ton of use
out of it and the next thing I got is
another Tommy Hilfiger set and it's just
kind of this semi cropped sweatshirt and
it has this big comfy hood and then
drawstrings on the front and this was my
favorite part out of the whole thing
down the arm it just has little stars
and I think that's super cute and it's
kind of like a charcoal gray color and
then to go with it it came with matching
drawstring sweatpants and then they just
have stars all the way down and they are
joggers so they are tight at the ankle
which I love then I got two items from a
low and if you guys don't know what that
is it's just another like athletic brand
kind of like Lululemon it's called a low
yoga and I got these leggings right here
they're just high waisted and they're
black and there's 7/8 pants which you
guys know that I like I love 7/8 pants
and they're super quad I don't know if
you can see on like the camera but they
have rips all down the front I think
that they're so fun I can show you here
on the tag they just look like that they
have rips all down the front and I'm so
excited to wear these I've been wanting
them literally forever so yeah thank you
so much mom in Santa for her
these pants I'm so obsessed with them I
cannot wait to wear them then I got this
cute black bomber jacket from a love -
and it is a shiny quilted material and
then it's also kind of short which I
really really really like and this is
what it looks like on the model it just
looks like that and I'm so excited for
this jacket you guys know that I used to
wear my few people want it all the time
it just really didn't go with everything
because it was kind of like a green
color so to have this black one it's
gonna be absolutely perfect I can't wait
to wear it because sometimes my Canada
goose honestly gets to be like too much
and sometimes I don't wanna wear a
jacket that that that's that heavy so
I'm so excited that I got this and then
I just got this back from made well and
I think I'm gonna switch it out for the
black one because that's the one that I
originally wanted but I didn't get the
block when I got the brown one which is
totally fine not not at all
but it's this leather bag and it cinches
right at the top so it's kind of like a
bucket bag almost and it has this long
strap so it's definitely not as big as
the transport tote that I have which I
really liked and I liked how it was
different and the reason why I want to
get the black one is because I already
have a brown leather back from Madewell
so I just was like wait that one doesn't
really go with everything so I wanna get
the black one so I'll be switching that
out but this is what it looks like it's
the perfect size it can literally fit
anything but I think that this bag is so
perfect it's the most perfect size I
love it made well has the best quality
bag so if you guys are looking for a
good bag I highly recommend looking at
me well and then I also got two items
from Lululemon that my mom told me about
this morning she was like oh they didn't
come in the mail like I can't believe
they didn't come in I spent all this
extra money for shipping blah blah blah
and so I did get two more items from
Lululemon I will insert pictures here I
just got this sports bra which I love
and honestly like I don't usually wear
Lululemon sports was just because they
are not like they don't go low enough on
my stomach I kind of like them to be
like cropped more so I can wear them as
a shirt with high waisted leggings so
I've got this sports bar from Lululemon
and I love it it can not wait for it to
come in I can't wait to wear it I know
I'm going to be wearing it a ton and
then I also got a pair of APL sneakers
and they just look like this and I
needed the new pair of sneakers to work
out in and to like run in and all that
so I just thought that these would be
perfect to have like a pair of sneakers
that I can specifically wear just for
the gym because I wear my nmds like when
I'm walking around like on campus
like everyday things and I just felt
like if I'm wearing them to the gym like
I don't want to be wearing them out
about during the day so I got a pair of
APL sneakers I heard that they're
amazing to work out in and I cannot wait
to get them and I almost forgot I got
one more thing for my brother he's so
cute he got me a Starbucks gift card so
yeah he's so cute
$50 to Starbucks which he knows me so
well he's like you can go you and Emma
can go together and you guys can take
pictures but you're so cute so yes I got
this from my brother so thank you Mike
so that concludes my what I got for
Christmas video I hope that everybody
has an amazing Christmas and you guys
got exactly what you wanted and things
like that I hope that everybody has a
healthy and happy and safe Christmas and
really just take this time to spend it
with your family try not to like go on
your phones and stuff like that today no
ATAR and if everybody's always posting
an Instagram snapchat all over social
media but I just think that today is
important to just take the time to spend
quality time with your family because
it's not every day that you've got to
spend time with everybody all in one
place like I know for me when I go to my
grandparents house later like I'm really
gonna try to not be on my phone just
enjoy the moment and like do you family
stuff like that so yes I hope that you
guys have an amazing Christmas thank you
so much for watching this video and I
will see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
