you're new here my name is Maggie and in
today's video i just thought that i
would do is something fun that i haven't
done in a really long time that i feel
like you guys wouldn't be interested in
and that is gonna be what i carry in my
everyday bag so the bag that i've
recently been loving and using is just
this black mini backpack by gucci and i
think it's called the gucci Marmont GG
something i really have no idea actually
what it's called but I'll have it linked
down below for you guys so I've been
loving this backpack I recently just got
it it looks like this it is just black
and kind of quilted and then has these
two little straps on the back and they
are adjustable which I really like and
so it has a big zipper not just unzips
like this and it carries literally so
much stuff in it that's why I thought
that this would be a good time to do
this video just because I'm leaving for
Italy in two days and I cannot bring
everything that's in this backpack with
me because it's so full and I have so
much random stuff in it that I was like
you don't need to clean the back out but
might as well do it on camera with you
guys and show you guys what I carry
every single day so I hope that you guys
enjoy this video I will have all of the
items that I show in my bag like the
chopsticks and miscellaneous stuff like
that that you guys will probably ask the
courts from and stuff we'll have all
that linked down below
super easy in case you guys want to buy
it so without further ado let's get
started
okay
so going into my bag the first thing I
have is my phone I have the iPhone 8
plus and then I have this little case
from case if I in it on it and it just
has like gold sparkles inside you can
shake it up it's really cute I just have
the white one then I have my glasses
which should really be in the case I
don't know why they're just like
randomly in my bag but these are the
Warby Parker well these and this is what
they look like they should like that
they're tortoise I'll have these link
down below as well I'm obsessed with
Warby Parker but I've been looking for
other glasses just because I've had
these ones forever and I want to be able
to have a different style and switch
them up so if you guys know any cute
places to get glasses let me know in the
comments below and then I have my camera

it so I'll buy you a new pack and I have
these nature's promise wipes I got these
for a row but just because when I'm on
the beach and stuff um and using tanning
oil
I like to just take one of these wipes
and like wipe my hand wipe my phone is
all that doesn't matter
they're just regular hypoallergenic
wipes by nature's promise so I like to
keep those on me just in case like I
need to wipe my hands or anything then I
have a little dust bag and this has a
tiny ring in it from bobbles and lace
you guys always ask me where these rings
are from right here just the rings I
wear I'm going to figure that our
diamond and they are from baubles and
lace as well and then this is the other
ring that I have in my dust bag the one
of my middle finger it's just really
cute now has a little diamond and then
on the other side it's like engraved
with rhinestones and I have this in the
dust bag that they gave me and then what

this is from Anthropologie and then I
just have my apartment keys my car key

white give this video a thumbs up if you
guys want to see a car tour I've gotten
a lot of questions about that I don't

interested in like leave a comment down
below let's look in my little pouch

me if I like this and like how much it
holds and seriously hold so much so in
my wallet I carry my Sephora VIP card I
have my debit card what is this my
student ID I go to Bridgewater State
University this is for the eyebrow
threading place and I go to sometimes my
health insurance card my driver's
license my triple-a card

I have that and then this is $6 rewards
for CD s wait I should use this it
expires in a few days I'll go to CVS
later and buy like toiletries and stuff
for my check and I'll use
okay and then I have another like random
Apple USB or not USB um cube to put a
USB in I've no idea why I have written
one of those in my bag random hair
elastic then I have this bracelet right
here which just says wicked and it is
just beaded looks like that and
sometimes I wear it
I've got inspired by my friend Morgan
who actually had one that like had her
like nickname on it and her cousin made
it for her and then I like wore it one
weekend when I was thinking you know
with her and I got obsessed with it so
we made them together and I made one
that says wicked I really like it and
then I also have one that says like a
bunch of other things I think one says
flea can't give it you're Gretchen and
then I have another one that I gave to
Emma also but those are super fun then I
just have a little packet of advil you
never know when you're gonna have a
headache or anything and then I also
have three eyelash schoolies and these
are gonna use on my eyelash extensions
just to like freshen them up and brush
them out so it's always nice to have
those I have those literally everywhere
they're all over my car they're all over
my bad look I just have another one
those are in the pockets okay so moving
on to the chap sticks that I have in my
bag look how many I have I've so many
this is so unnecessary so I have this
which one is this I think this one's the
vanilla bean yeah my Burt's Bees this
one's my favorite I love it right now
and then I also have the strawberry
Burt's Bees chapstick and this one I
used to be obsessed with and I think
when I was in Miami yeah when I was in
Miami and I Coachella I like loved at
this one I go through phases where I
like like certain flavors of Burt's Bees
and like I don't like them but right now
I'm loving the vanilla bean one and then
I also have this cope re lip love right
here and I think that this one is
flavored coconut I'm pretty sure but I
love this lip balm yeah oh my god it
smells so good
and it just makes your lips super smooth
oh my god my camera is about to die I
need to hurry
I've been filming a lot today and then
this one is just the Brazilian kiss lip
butter by Sol de Janeiro Janerio but
it's like that brand the Brazilian
bumbum cream this is the chopstick it
smells so good it smells like cocoa
butter and Gretchen introduced me to
this I'm obsessed with it and then last
but not least I have the Smith's rosebud
Sal balm just looks like this you guys
have probably seen it before I get these
from Anthropologie there's like a ton of
different flavors I really like these
during the summer only during the summer
though because I feel like during the
winter they make my lips chapped but
during the summer they give you like a
nice sheen on your lips last but not
least I have my Apple earpods
these are my absolute favorite
headphones ever I used to use the
wireless beats but I felt like the cord
and the bass that like hung below them
would get caught in my hair and it
really bothered me and I really love the
Apple headphones just because they fit
like so well into my ears who's turned
on but so I bought the air pods and
there's the best when you're on the
plane and you like don't have any like
strings hanging and stuff and you can
like walk through the airport like work
out and do everything so much more
freely and they come in this case which
also charges it so that's really nice
but I am gonna end up this video before
my camera dies I hope that you guys
enjoyed it if you like seeing these I
can do them every couple of weeks or
like every month just to see like what's
in my bag and what changes and like what
I don't take outfits clearly I have so
much stuff in my bag that I just like
even there and let pile up so I hope
that you guys enjoyed this video and
found it interesting and thank you guys
