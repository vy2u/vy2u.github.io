today's video I am going to be showing
you what I carry every single day in my
bag and right now I'm just using this
little white structured Rebecca Minkoff
bag it kind of has the same look as the
saline bag but this one was a lot less
expensive as goes once it's just this
white structured bag with these little
handles and it has a long crossbody
strap and some gold detailing on it this
bag is so cute it's so tiny I don't know
if you can tell in the camera but look
at it really soft little I love it so
much it just has these little handles
you can hold it like this for wear
crossbody so yeah without further ado
let's see what's in my bag a disclaimer
this is literally everything that I've
been carrying the past couple days it's
so full I got home from work for you
late last night and I just kind of threw
it on my desk and then picked it up this
morning to go over on some errands so
everything that's in my bag is what I
honestly have been carrying around for
the past few days so it's wicked happy
I'm really scared to see what's inside I
hope that it's not embarrassing I have
so much stuff in it so yeah let's get
started I'm so nervous
this bag is literally completely false I
don't know if you can see that it's so
full so the first thing that's in my bag
is just my actual glasses case and these
are from Warby Parker they just look
like this they are tortoise and they I
think they are called yet the Welty's so
these are the well seized from Warby
Parker and I need to have my actual
glasses with me at all times because I'm
so blind I can
see it all and I don't like contacts for
some reason I hate wearing contacts like
I just hate the feeling of putting my
hands on my face it grosses me out it's
so Jeremy so I just carried my glasses
with me wherever and I get headaches low
if they don't wear them so I carry them
with me because at some point during the
day I'm gonna need them especially while
I'm driving
and then inside my case just is this
little cloth to clean them and then I
have the three tickets here from when I
went to my boyfriend's baseball games
last weekend so I just kept those I
don't know why I just threw them in my
glasses case but they're still in there
and the next thing in my bag I just have
this little package of Mario Badescu
samples
it has a vitamin C serum and a seaweed
night cream I got these from Ulta like a
week ago and kind of takes them I won't
I haven't tried them yet but I'm really
excited to try those and then next I
just have one of these little hair ties
one of those ones that don't crease your
hair I should probably put this on my
wrists right now but I usually just keep
going with me wherever I go
in case I want to throw my hair and a
braid or put it in a ponytail things
like that so I think that that's always
nice to have next I have my actual
sunglasses they are the Raven hexagon
ones they just look like this they are
the gold in black ones and they are size
54 so these are like my everyday
sunglasses that I wear all the time if
you follow me on instagram you would see
that I literally wear them every single
day whenever I need them so I have those
then I have my favorite lip gloss which
is this Mac one right here it's called
fashion scoop this is my favorite lip
gloss ever it's so neutral it looks
great with everything so I keep this in
my bag at all times I'm actually running
out of it so I'm gonna need to get a new
one really soon
then I just have this Smith's tropical
emarosa
balm with coconut I bought this from
Anthropologie a few months ago but this
smells amazing and it's one of my
favorite chopsticks other than the
Burt's Bees coconut and pear one and
then I just have this little dust bag
from made well it has all of my gold
rings inside I must have taken them off
and just throwing them in there I don't
know why they're in there I used to
usually keep them in my jewelry box but
I have those in my bag then I have a
little mini travel size Tommy it is the
reason why I'm using my bag it's because
I love ice cream so much like literally
I eat it every single day I love it it's
my favorite thing in the whole world but
every single time I eat it my stomach
hurts and I think it's because of dairy
and whatever but every single time my
stomach hurts but I'm not going to not
eat it because I love it so I always
keep travels with me and whenever I fry
you guys can make this always have one
of the Thomas because it'll make my
stomach feel better so I keep those with
me literally at all times and I also
have two tampons
they are the Kotex click those are my
absolute favorite love them won't ever
use any other kind other than those and
then I have my little mini Mario Badescu
cucumber aloe green tea facial spray and
my roommate actually told me to get this
one because we both use the Rose one but
the I guess they just came out with this
one she said so much better so when I
went to Ulta I just
this many went up to have in my bag at
all times just in case uh it literally
feels so good and when freshing on my
face and it smells amazing I love this
stuff so much I'm so about that I picked
up a mini one because I use it all the
time so now it's gonna be nice just to
have my bag whenever I need it if I'm
like um go at work things like that then
on the bottom of my bag I have two sets
of keys these are actually the keys to
my apartment in Boston I should give
those back to my dad couples for like a
week and then I have my wallet with my
car key I just have this key it flips
open like that my driving a Volkswagen
Jetta so that's my keep and then I have
my little mini Louie Vuitton to keep out
which inside of here I have a few coins
my debit card a Target gift card a room
key don't need that anymore my insurance
card my student ID my license and my
support the ID card so that's that's
what I carry with me at all times inside
my wallet then the last thing I have is
just my name tag and pin that I wear
with my uniform at work
I just keep that in my back so I don't
forget it whenever I go to work then in
this little side pocket here I have a
bunch of junk I have I think this is an
extra little tassel thingy tip that goes
on the front of my bag so I have so
those extra ones that came with it the
Rebecca Minkoff card another Rebecca
Minkoff random card and then I have a
few receipts I have this one from Target
I bought
a sticky bra and some things that I
needed when I was traveling then I also
have a tag from TJ Maxx I don't know
what I got but I have a tag also a
receipt from TJ Maxx and then this is a
receipt from Tzar oh I returned if you
think that's RSO I have that so that

my bag thank you so much for watching
