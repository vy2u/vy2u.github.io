today's video I just thought that it
would be fun to do a little what's on my
iPhone video you guys have been
requesting this so much ever since I got
my new phone I did one of these a while
back like right when I started my
channel during the fall so I just
thought that it would be fun to do a
little updated version since I did just
get a new phone so without further ado
let's get started with what is on my
iPhone so this is the phone that I have
I just have the iPhone 8 plus and it's
in the rose gold color you can't really
tell the sides of rose gold in the back
is kind of like a whitish gold color and
this is just the case that I have on my
phone right now it's this case that just
says mags on it and it has this gold
like sparkly stuff inside and if you
like shake it up it's just like moves
around and if you guys didn't know mags
is like a nickname for Maggie and that's
what my dad calls me like Tyler calls me
and so I don't know I just thought that
it was kind of cute to get this instead
of like Maggie on the back of my case
but anyway this is my iPhone and I think
I'm gonna do like that screen muttering
thing where you can like record what
your screen looks like so I can put it
in the video right here and then show
you guys what is exactly on my iPhone
and kind of like go through it with you
so I'm gonna start that right now when
you look at the home screen of my phone
it's just this photo as you guys see
right now with me and Kaylee when we
were in Miami and I thought that was
really cute just because it's like a
cute fun plain background to have and it
looks really clean and fresh on your
phone so that's why I have it on it and
it's one of my favorite pictures right
now and then you open it up to my home
screen which is just this light blue
background and these are the way that my
apps are set up I just have them all
color-coordinated because I really about
OCD so I don't know I just thought that
it looks so much more fresh and clean
when everything is all organized and by
color so it's pretty self-explanatory
what I have on my homepage just
basically all of the apps that come on
your iPhone like music photos calendar
iBooks find my friends
reminders notes you guys get the gist
you can see what I have on my home
screen but I really like the find my
friends app it's my absolute favorite
because I have a lot of my close friends
yeah pretty self-explanatory but I
really like tracking my friends and so
that's one of my favorite app and then
if you swipe over to the next page I
just have all of my apps that I use on a
day-to-day basis so at the top I just
have my BSU mobile app which is the app
for my school I go to Bridgewater State
University in Massachusetts so I just
have my school app where I can check my
grades class schedule like any
cancellations check my email stuff like
that and then I have Poshmark and
Poshmark is my absolute favorite app for
buying well I don't really buy on it but
it's my favorite app for selling my
clothes and if you guys want to check
out my posh market I'll have a link to
my posh break down below and you can
also use the code pqy and a for a $5
credit towards any purchase and I'm
always posting new things on Poshmark
just to try to clean up my closet like
keep things in rotation so I absolutely
love that app then I have the daily
horoscope app which is my favorite I'm
always reading my horoscope and then I
have just Pinterest and I have a period
tracker as well just to track like when
I'm gonna get my period and stuff like
that I've been using out a lot lately

of my favorites and then I just have
Instagram I'm obsessed with Instagram
you guys should totally follow me if you

feed looks like in terms one of my
favorite apps in the whole world I

app which is just for my school email
venmo you guys know to like send your
friends money if they pay for something
then my favorite app of all time which
is don't and it's my obsession it's so
dangerous because it literally is the
mobile mall you put all of your
information in and then you can go on
and scroll through and look at all of
the different stores like if I wanted to
buy something from princess Polly I
could go on look through add it to my
card if I wanted to buy something from
Sephora go through same thing add it to
my cart and then you literally buy
everything all at once and it gets
shipped to you and you don't have to
update your card information or your
address or anything it's all saved so
it's literally like whatever you want at
one click it's so dangerous I'm so
obsessed with it and if you guys also
want to sign up for don't you guys can
use my code Maggie for a $5 credit to
any store which is literally like a gift
card to Sephora Brady Melville Urban
Outfitters literally any store dote my
absolute favorite I love it you guys
need it then I have Twitter which I
don't really use what I'm starting to
use more but my Twitter is just at
Maggie Mac D underscore and I don't
really use Twitter that much but I'm
starting to use it more so you guys
should follow me on Twitter and then I
also have PayPal to like send money to
my account through like different things
that I get paid for on PayPal and if I
need to buy something and I don't feel
like putting my credit card in it's just
easier to use my PayPal account so I
have PayPal then

cell phone bill all that fun stuff
uber pretty self-explanatory if I'm ever
in a city need a ride call an uber pop
in you know the gist send my two
favorite editing apps of all time after

like that you guys want to check it out
you can follow me on there as well and
then on the next page I just have a
bunch of apps that I don't really use
that much so I have like a travel folder
with like a JetBlue app Airbnb the MBTA
like ticket thing for the commuter rail
which goes from my school to Boston I
have opentable Park Boston which is just
a parking app that I can use when I go
to Boston I just have like my card
information in my car all programmed
into there so like when I get my eyelash
and something just pull up out front I
can pay my meter right on my phone which
is really helpful and then I have over
eats
I'm absolutely eats I love it so much
but I can only use that when I'm in
Boston or Miami I use it so much in
Miami but we don't have it here in
Bridgewater I live which is really sad
uber eats if you're watching this you
need to come to Bridgewater because I'm
obsessed and then also hotel tonight
which is just this really cool app where
you could go on and you can look through
all of the different hotels that they
have and whatever city is near you and
then it comes up and you can literally
book your hotel room like right then and
there
and it gives you like a really cheap
rate so like Hotel Commonwealth my
favorite hotel of all time you can click
on it you can book a hotel room for 2:16
for one night instead of it being 509 so
that's really helpful then I have
another category folder thing called
work and it just has a bunch of
different like work things on it like
files Google Drive Google Docs Dropbox
all those and then I also have my last
folder which is just lifestyle and in
this I just have a bunch of different
apps that I don't really use on a
day-to-day basis so I have with my
Amazon app urban outfitters app kirakira
which is this really cool app that you
can add a photo and then put like a
sparkly effect on it I used to use it a
long time ago I don't really use it that
much anymore so that's why I kind of
have it like on the back burner last
page of my phone because I don't really
use it and then I have cut story which I
use sometimes when I post like a longer
Instagram story on my Instagram like if
I have a one-minute video and I want to
cut it up into all the 15 to 15 seconds
like segments I just uploaded to cup
story and then it does it all for me and
then I have the unfollowing app which I
don't use anymore I should probably
delete it so it just told you like who
unfollowed your Instagram and stuff so
like you can fall unfold in fact if they
can follow you which I really don't care
anymore so I should probably delete that
don't use it and then I also have the
dry bar app which is super helpful just
if I want a book blow out it's so easy
to just go on my phone scheduled my
appointment and pay for it all in one so
I love that app and yeah basically that
is what is on my iPhone so that
concludes what is on my iPhone I know a
ton of you guys have been requesting to
see that video so I hope that you guys
enjoyed it and thank you so so much for
watching this video I love you guys so
much I will see you in my next one bye
