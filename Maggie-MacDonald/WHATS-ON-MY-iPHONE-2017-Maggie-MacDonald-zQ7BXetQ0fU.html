today's video I'm gonna be doing
something that is so highly requested
and that is showing you what is on my
iPhone I just have the iPhone 7 in the
white with gold I have this red Apple
case on it right now it is the silicon
one so I'm gonna be showing you guys
what is on my iPhone how I set up all my
apps and things like that and before we
get started I just wanted to say thank
you to the app best fiends for
sponsoring this video best fiends is a
free puzzle adventure game where you can
collect and build a team of fiends to
defeat slugs by matching same colored
objects this month best fiends is having
their biggest update ever adding over a
hundred and fifty levels to their app
and you can download the game for free
in the App Store and if you download it
now using my link below you will get
five dollars worth of gold and diamonds
for free I have been loving best fiends
so much lately I've been playing it like
crazy I'm on level 31 the app is
literally so addicting and this is how
the app actually looks it's so much fun
you just go through and you slide your
finger along all of the little different
objects and that's how you get points
but yeah that's how the app works it's
pretty self-explanatory but it's really
really addicting like I'm not just
saying this it seriously it's so
addicting I find myself going on to play
and then I look at my phone in like an
hour has passed oh that is best fuse I
just want to show you guys that a little
bit before we get started on the video
and going into the apps that I actually
have on my phone if you see my home
screen my phone just opens up and this
is what it looks like on the inside I
just have all of the apps that came with
my iPhone the ones that apple provides
for you on the first page and all of
them I kind of try to keep them a little
bit color-coordinated so as you can see
I just have like health music photos
calendar and all those apps on the first
page but and then if you salida over to
the second page I have all of the apps
that I had to get myself from the App
Store just all the apps that I
use every single day I don't put any of
my apps into folders I kind of just
leave them all on my home screen and I
do like to color color coordinate them I
just think that it looks so much more
clean and like it's more refreshing when
looking at my phone and having them all
like match each other and kind of like
flow and the apps that I have on my
phone I just have the app for my college
I go to and with this app I can just go
on and like see which classes that I'm
taking and go on my school email the
calendar all those things and then I
also have this app Poshmark where you
can shop my closet on Poshmark my user
name is Amy McDonald and I use this app
to sell all of my clothes that I don't
wear anymore and things I just want to
get rid of because as you guys know I
love shopping I'm always buying new
things so I just thought that the best
way to kind of keep my closet from
overflowing is just to get rid of things
that I don't wear anymore I just feel
like if I'm not wearing it I would like
somebody else to get good use out of it
so you can shop my closet on Poshmark
and use the code PQ y na for five
dollars off your first purchase and then
the next app on my phone that I
absolutely love is the daily horoscope
app and I read my horoscope every single
day so I just go on the app and then
click on my zodiac which is Scorpio and
it literally tells you the horoscope for
today tomorrow it has your weekly
horoscope your monthly literally has
everything I go on this every single day
there literally isn't a day where I
don't read my horoscope it's one of the
things that my roommate and I are
absolutely obsessed with and then going
back to my home screen I just have all
these other apps on it like the
followers app on Instagram I have
obviously Instagram YouTube soul cycle
snapchat Starbucks I have the app for my
bank so I can just go on and like check
how much money I have and deal with
everything like that I also have the
Spotify app which is the app that I use
to listen to music you can also follow
me on Spotify I will have all of my
social media accounts linked down below
and I have the outlook app which is just
another email app that I use for the
email like my school email so I'll use
that and then I have
venmo which if you guys use phone you
know just like to send money to your
friends and stuff i have the twitter up
but i don't actually use it or I don't
go on Twitter I do have an account and I
don't tweet I don't even know what I
have anymore
I should probably delete it and then one
of the apps that I use the most is just
my tumblr app many of you guys I know
follow me on tumblr that's where I just
like to answer a lot of the questions
that you have for me so this is what my
app looks like I just go in I click and
I can read all the questions that you
guys have and I just really like using
it to connect with you and be able to
like answer some of the questions that
you have and things like that and then
going back to my home screen I just have
the uber app which you guys know
obviously uber is really popular I have
that just in case if I like I'm ever in
a city and like I don't want to walk
somewhere or I need a ride anywhere I'll
just use the uber app and then I also
have afterlight which is another app
that I use to edit my pictures on
sometimes I just like to use it to
brighten up any pictures or like add
contrast highlight things like that so I
will use the after light app for that
and then I have the 18t app on my phone
just so I can pay my phone bill and kind
of just like access my ATT count and
things like that then I have the Amazon
app I am obsessed with Amazon Prime I
always always always order things on
Amazon if I need it to come to my
doorstep right away which just reminded
me I need to order coffee cups on Amazon
because I love making coffee at home but
I don't like putting it in like a travel
tumbler mug if you guys know what I mean
and then at the bottom the last app that
I have is just the visco app and I've
edit all of my Instagram pictures on
visco I have done a video on how I edit
my pictures it's up on my channel I will
leave the link to that down below but
that is the app that I use mainly to
edit all of my Instagram photos and then
if you swipe over to the last page on my
phone I just have a little folder called
extra and it's a bunch of extra apps
that I don't really use it all that I
just needed a place for because the apps
on the page before are ones that I use
every single day so I just kind of
didn't want any of those in a folder I
just wanted to
be able to look at my screen and see all
of them and be able to just open
whichever ones I want and then on the
bottom row of my iPhone I just have the
apps that I use the absolute most I have
the phone app the Safari app the
messages app in the mail app I love
having those ones at the bottom because
I can just access them at any time
because they are on the bottom of my
screen so if I'm on the first page the
last page whatever it may be I can just
access those so that concludes the one
is on my iPhone video I have gotten so
many requests about this so I hope you
guys enjoyed seeing what is on my iPhone
