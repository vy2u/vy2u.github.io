has been exactly a week since the last
time I posted video and I know I haven't
posted anything in a whole entire week I
kind of just needed to take the week off
I had a lot going on that was kind of
unexpected and the other side was
expected and has been kind of like
something that's just been going on in
my life lately so I thought that I would
sit down and tell you guys what has been
going on not because I want you to like
feel bad for me or I want to like
complain about my problems that is not
what I want to do at all I just kind of
wanted to like let you guys know what's
been going on in my life and kind of
give you some advice on how I'm dealing
with these problems and maybe they can
even help you guys because both of the
things that happened are things that
happened in everybody's life like
they're super common and it's not just
me that they're happening to so I just
thought that I would sit down and share
it with you guys and if you guys have
any questions or you want to talk to
anybody feel free to send me messages on
Instagram leave all of your comments
down below I'd love to read them so
without further ado let's get started
okay so where do I start off with this
honestly the first thing I wanted to say
before going into where I've been is
just the fact that because I was feeling
so like depressed and unhappy I didn't
want to continue posting because I
didn't think that that would be fair to
you guys I want to keep my channel
authentic and real and honestly if I sat
in front of the camera and did like a
makeup tutorial or a fashion video and
pretended to be happy and pretended for
like the whole entire thing like that
just is not what I want it's not
realistic I was not happy last week
honestly from last Thursday until
yesterday I was completely like broken I
had never felt that way in my whole
entire life it like I don't even know
how to describe it but I
didn't want to like post anything on
YouTube for a whole week I just wanted
to take as much time off because
honestly what you see on social media is
not real life I didn't want to make you
guys think that I was living this happy
awesome life when really I was unhappy I
just don't want to portray that on my
channel so going into the two things
that have been going on in my life this
past week I recently like got my heart
broken I know that sounds like kind of
cliche but so I was with somebody since
August of last year August 2016 and we
go to the same school I was with him for
a year a year and then we broke up and
like a bunch of things happened we got
back together because like we well I
still had feelings for him and like we
were trying to work things out like see
where it was gonna go and he basically
just like cut me out of his life on
Thursday of last week so that has been
like super difficult for me and honestly
like I've never experienced like
anything like that before like I had
never felt that way before my body
literally felt numb like I couldn't do
the things that I love doing like it
couldn't make youtube videos because I
genuinely like wasn't not happy and I
don't want to cry right now I literally
don't wanna cry at all but I couldn't
make youtube videos I literally couldn't
even get out of bed for a whole entire
week like I went to visit Gretchen over
the weekend and like to get my mind off
things like we did a bunch of stuff like
obviously you guys saw the vlog from
that weekend but it was still on my mind
and like it had been like so fresh that
I could still go out and do stuff but
once I got home from visiting Gretchen I
just kind of like broke down Monday
Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday until
Saturday I didn't do anything I
literally just like hung out at my
apartment and I like elated that I don't
even remember what I did I didn't go to
class
I like could barely eat I just did not
feel like myself I think my friends
would try to hang out with me and like
make me feel better and obviously that
didn't make me feel so much better I
love my friends were doing that I'm so
thankful that they were there for me but
that it's like the second I'm alone it's
just like I can't even describe the
feeling like my chest hurts so bad and I
literally feel numb like I just lay
there and like I don't know and like
it's kind of like it's crazy to think
that like a boy can make you feel this
way but like I don't even know where I'm
going with this story like I don't
really even want to go into detail about
it cuz like I'm gonna try to like I'm
getting over it but I don't really like
want to go into detail about like what
went on just because like I don't know I
don't really want that like on YouTube
for the sake of other person but oh so
and then on Wednesday actually wait
maybe it was Tuesday Tuesday yeah
Tuesday I bought a dog as you I saw on
Instagram I bought a dog because I was
like you know what I'm gonna bike get a
dog and I'll be able to take care of it
and love it and keep my mind off things
and then I went to bed
Tuesday night woke up one day morning
I'm like 4 a.m. and I was having such a
bad allergic reaction to the dog so I
had to bring the dog back on Wednesday
which was really really hard for me
because like I wanted something to keep
my mind off of it and like wanted
something to have responsibility for and
I thought that the dog would help and
then I ended up like being allergic so I
had to bring her back so that happened
and then Thursday and Friday we're
probably the worst two days and just
like literally didn't do anything and I
cried and got all my tears out Saturday
woke up and I went to Boston my mom and
I spent the whole weekend with her and
it was really great and it just felt so
good and like refreshing to get out of
here and like just keep my mind off
things and be busy and do things that I
like and kind of get back into it like I
posted a lot on Instagram as you guys
saw I posted a lot on snapchat that was
really amazing but I just go back to my
apartment now Sunday
and like I'm alone again but it doesn't
feel as bad as it did in the past like
obviously the feeling is still there but
I'm kind of like realizing a lot of
things and then coming to my senses and
obviously with the two situations going
on everybody has told me that time heals
everything and I'm the biggest believer
in that every single time I try to give
anybody advice I just tell them that it
will get better in time and everything
happens for a reason and obviously it's
easier said than done because when I am
like I'm still going through it but when
I was feeling like so down and so bad
everybody would just tell me Maggie like
time heals everything that everything
happens for a reason that there are
better things to come bla bla bla the
whole nine yards I'm just like oh my god
like but I hurt so bad that like I
couldn't I felt like I couldn't deal
with it and I was just like yeah but
it's easier said than done but really
like the more time goes by and like the
more I get used to it like I just feel
like it's so true like time does heal
everything and everything does happen
for a reason so I don't know I'm so
young I just need to like realize that
and kind of like get over for now but I
don't know I guess like once I'm over
this whole entire situation I can like
own I also think I have like bronchitis
or something anyway but once I am like
completely over this situation and I
feel like I'm in a better place to talk
about it I feel like I can maybe make a
video on like how to get over a breakup
and things like that so if that's
something you guys would like to see it
just like leave your comments down below
give this video a thumbs up and I think
I'm going to end this video here I don't
really know what I just said I kind of
just blocked out so yeah I'm gonna like
look at this footage and edit it and
then upload it because I just wanted to
like give you guys an update but from
now on like I'm really really really
gonna try and I'm gonna get back into
things I'm starting to feel better so I
just want to like make my life normal
again and get back into a routine so I
will be continuing vlogmas for the rest
of the time being
so sorry that this had to happen I know
you guys love seeing my videos and I
just didn't want to let you down by not
posting but I physically like could not
do anything so I didn't want to like sit
down and force myself to make a video
that wasn't me and like wasn't authentic
and like that wasn't when I was happy
and I don't want I don't know I just
like didn't want that negative video on
my youtube channel so now we're gonna
move on from it like I know that it's
like real life so like obviously these
situations are real life situations they
happen everyday in people's lives all
over so I just thought that I would
still tell you guys what was going on
but like I said if you guys want me to
go into detail about like how to get
over a breakup or how I did like once
I'm finally over it I would love to make
a video so just give this video a thumbs
up leave all of your comments down below
thank you so much for watching and also
thank you to all of you who reached out
to me on Instagram and told me that
you're thinking of me and you knew that
I like wasn't posting for a week and you
could tell something was wrong
like all those messages that I got were
so heartwarming and I'm so thankful for
each and every one of you so I will
continue to be doing vlogmas like I said
and yeah so I'm just gonna try to like
get back into like the swing of things
and hopefully get over this in time I
know that you air is gonna help me
through it a ton I honestly like
wouldn't be doing this and doing YouTube
if it weren't for all of you so I cannot
thank you enough and the moral of this
video was just to tell you guys that
what you see on social media is not real
life
like I was posting things on Instagram
last weekend when I wasn't happy at all
like things were on my mind and I was
just posting them to post but I wasn't
actually happy so if you're looking at
people's instagrams and you're like oh
my god this person has a perfect life
like they're on the beach they're in
bathing suits they're tan they have
perfect bodies like they have a perfect
relationship no I swear I promise you
that everybody has their struggles and
what you see on social media is not
realistic and it is not real life so
don't make yourself feel bad for
whatever you see if you're looking at
someone's account and you're like oh I
wish that that was my life that person
you don't know they may have
problems going on that you have no idea
about because they only post the
positive things in your life so just
remember that so I'm gonna end that
video here thank you guys so much for
watching and I will see you in
tomorrow's video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
