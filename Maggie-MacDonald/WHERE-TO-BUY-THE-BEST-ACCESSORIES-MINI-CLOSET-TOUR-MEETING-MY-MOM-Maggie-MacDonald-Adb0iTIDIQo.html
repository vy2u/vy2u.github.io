currently 1:30 right now I've been up
since I think 7:00 this morning it seems
like this day it's gone on for literally
eternity it's insane like I have done so
much today I'm it's crazy but I'm the
worst ever and I'm finally like putting
all the my Christmas wishlist items
together so that's what I've been doing
all morning and I thought I would start
off the vlog by showing you guys some
ideas of things that you can ask for for
Christmas if you are like me in your
list is very last-minute so I have been
obsessing over this watch lately you
guys would have seen it in my vlog from
yesterday it is just a JC watch and
yesterday I actually had a tan leather
strap on it but today I change it to the
black one to go with my grey outfit just
because it went a lot better and I love
that they have the interchangeable
straps you can get them on their website
for I think around $65 which i think is
super helpful because honestly the tan
would not have gone with my outfit so I
think that the black one is absolutely
amazing and I was talking about the
watch yesterday in my vlog and I
misspoke and the watches are actually
founded by somebody in the same family
as the person who started the Michelle
watches which you can get on Nordstrom
they're very high quality and they are
beautiful but these watches are also
gorgeous you guys should totally check
them out if you are looking for a
last-minute gift I will have all their
information linked down below they are
so amazing look at the diamonds
sparkling and the straps are real
leather these watches really dress up
any outfit they are super chic and super
timeless I am absolutely obsessed like I
was saying if you guys want to check out
the JC watches I will have all of their
information linked down below
another amazing gift idea from Madewell
would be the transport tote my sister
and I both have these totes and I use
mine for literally everything guys and
we both have this one right here it is
just the signature brown leather
transport tote and they are 168 which
it's kind of pricey for a bag but
honestly they are real leather and they
will last you forever I use mine for
everything I use it for the beach I use
it for like literally anything I need it
fits so much it looks so good with any
outfit and the great thing is is that
right now if you order within the next
18 hours and 21 minutes you get 30% off
your entire breakfast and you get it by
Christmas so if you are looking for
something else to add to your list
definitely add the made well transport
tote because they're amazed and I love
them this morning I've really been
working on my winter 2017 playlist I
don't know why the lighting is really
weird but I've added so many songs you
guys should go follow me on Spotify I
always have all of my socials linked
down below so I'll get out of that
oh hi am i miss are I can we just you're
in it actually tomorrow I was gonna say
two days but this is just what I'm
wearing today like I have so much
running around and so many errands to do
in so much homework just because like I
have my last final tomorrow so I'm just
casually wearing the same variation of
an outfit that I wear every single day
you guys are probably like you we're
literally the same thing every day but
it's my favorite and I'm super casual
and honestly like at my school people
like don't dress up so I always wear
like athleisure I'm just wearing my la
hot brandy cropped long-sleeve gray
aligns my great sneakers I just got done
wrapping a bunch of my Christmas gifts
as you can see I'm obsessed with
anthropology so yeah hopefully the
people that I got gifts for is gonna
like my anthropology gifts because it is
an anthropology Christmas I need to find
all the things that I sold on Poshmark
I have some stuff in my car but I'm
gonna go ship out all of these items oh
I have to pay some bills I'll put those
over there I have so much to do where
the heck's my phone oh my god guys I
just got this new case from Apple as you
guys know I've always had the red
silicone case but I just got the orange
one and I'm really sad because I miss my
red one a lot like I really really
really miss it so
I'm just like waiting for this one to
break so I can get a red one again but I
have a super busy day I will try to keep
you guys updated as much as I possibly
can
yeah I don't know I just feel like I
wanted to update you guys and inform you
and tell you that the vlogs are gonna be
so much more exciting once I go home for
break because literally this week well
the two weeks in December after
Thanksgiving are always super busy with
school and there's just been so much
going on that I haven't done like doing
fun things so yeah I will keep you guys
a little bit updated with that I think I
have a few clips from this weekend that
I will put into the end of this vlog
just because I didn't have enough time
to actually make a big vlog out of that
and so I just have a few clips I still
like want to show you guys from my
weekend but I just had lunch I had a
salad I posted it on my snapchat I will
insert the picture here and if you don't
have me on snapchat I will put my little
code right here on the screen you guys
can totally add me I post all day on
snap all day on my Instagram story I
love it I love to be you guys updated so
if you guys want to know what what I'm
doing with my life and get to know me on
a more personal level you can totally
follow all my social medias I will have
them all linked down below so I just got
coffee number two of the day and like oh
my god I can't even like describe how
good it is honestly not because I need
the caffeine and need the energy I
genuinely love the taste of iced coffee
like black completely black iced coffee
from Mary Lou's if you guys are ever in
like Massachusetts are anywhere and like
the south east I guess go to mayor lose
it's so good and I get toasted almond
black but I used to get almond milk and
then I kind of like went away from
getting almond milk and I just got it
back and it's literally so good but yeah
so I should probably like get decaf I
guess that's why they like make decaf
maybe if like people don't like the
caffeine I literally don't need the
caffeine that I just love the taste of
it so yeah maybe that'll give me like
some more energy before I go to the gym
tonight too so I did like a little hat
change but guys I literally need to pack
to go home and I have no idea what to
pack literally no idea
so this is like the little set up of my
closet I know a lot of people have like
asked me to do a closet or like show you
guys how I organize my closet so uh yeah
maybe I can just do like a little
run-through right now so I have skirts
and pants right here like fun pants that
aren't jeans and all my skirts and then
I just have all of my white and cream
tops right er my orange tops which only
have a few my one blue top that I own
all of my blacks my greens and then all
my jackets as you can tell I don't like
to wear color I really like to wear
neutrals that's why I have a ton of like
whites blacks greens things like that
and then up here at the top I just have
like a little like shelving thing I
think it's from Target and then I just
have my easy box my uggs some extra
sweatshirts right here and then these
are all of my jeans I really don't own
that many pairs of jeans I only have 4
pairs but those are all my jeans these
are a mess but these are sports bras and
this basket in this basket right here
which is supposed to be turned like that
is underwear and that Lululemon bag has
socks in it so and then down here at the
bottom I have clothes that I haven't
hung up yet like clothes that have been
sent to me things like that in this
little box right here I got this one
from Target it's super cute and then I
just have this plastic container from my
freshman year of college that has all my
leggings in this top drawer that drawer
has like tank tops and little shirts and
this bottom drawer has some sweatshirts
and like shorts and stuff like that and
then over there I just have a few more
pairs of shoes then I have this a big
shoe rack on the back of my door which
honestly is a lifesaver it holds so many
pairs of shoes and I don't know why you
still like keep my shoes and boxes but I
was like you know what boxes take up so
much room I was really limited on space
this year last year I had a huge closet
so I wasn't gonna put all my shoe boxes
up top there because it would have taken
up way too much room so I just got that
from Target and then on the back of my
door I just have these two little hooks
I keep my Louboutins
right here and then all of my everyday
bags right here I have like my may well
bag my koi yard and then I have my
little Ferragamo crossbody and then in
here I just have some extra like small
Lululemon bags just in case who have is
calling me Oh God Kate Lee's calling me
one sec
mom this is a good outfit of the day
mayor I guess I'll show my outfit I
can't even speak so bear with me I'm
wearing three people sweater these
saffle little leather legging things
they fit really weird but they look
really cute and then I'm wearing my
creates sneakers I love these shoes so
much they're my new favorite I like them
way better than the adidas I'm
definitely going to be wearing my greats
all the time I will have the link to the
Great's website down below if you guys
won't check these out
obviously my Canada Goose jacket and
this is our hotel room we're staying in
the executive suite this weekend at
Hotel Commonwealth my favorite hotel in
Boston and this is just what it looks
like we have a nice big bed for my mom
and I and then we have like this little
sitting area which is super cutie oh my
god they have this in every room Lily
Marcus and Jack oh my god you guys don't
remember this go wait a little get in
and puff went away and then this is our
view it's just of Boston outside and
that's what it looks like and I love
this little sitting area I'm definitely
gonna get a cute Instagram and look at
my mom she's so cute she's doing like a
little thing on her fin stuff so my mom
and I decided that we are gonna go to
Newberry right now because our hotel is
that kind of new Newberry it's not even
artwork at all probably like ten minutes
so we're gonna go do that
and yeah we're just gonna send it but we
got our hair done that Drybar a couple
hours ago just for the event tonight and
I am obsessed with it Gretchen was like
Maggie literally you're gonna try drive
out and they're gonna be so in love with
it so I loved it and it was only forty
five dollars which is not even that at
all because it looks amazing usually my
hair is so hard to like style because
it's so straight and so fine but it
looks amazing and I got them my tie by
the way
hey guys so on our way to the event
finally dress is from I am gia it is I
got off of revolve but it's from I am

these really cool bamboo hoops and then
I'm just wearing my Scorpio necklace and
these shoes from Target

and we are going to red lantern to go to
the party so we have to call an uber and
we'll be off look how cute my mom looks
mom outfit of the day where where's our
outfit from dress and shoes same same
earrings we picked out for her from
forever 21
both of us have our forever 21 earrings
on tonight they were super cheap and
they're so cute
definitely a good staple to have because
like accessories are a thing where you
don't really wear them I'm gonna put a
ring on where you don't really wear them
like as often so I wouldn't recommend
like spending a ton of money on like
little accessories like that so that's
why forever 21 is perfect for fun
jewelry just drop to one of my rings but
I need to get all my stuff right now I'm
putting on my rings and then we're gonna
send yeah well I'm gonna call it right
now because it littering these gonna
