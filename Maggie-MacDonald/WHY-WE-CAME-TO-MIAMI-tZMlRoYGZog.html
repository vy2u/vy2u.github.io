not getting home and I need to like as
much as I can but bathing suit today is
from cellphone and I must even sees for
example as well and that's that's kind
of why we're here in this moment right
now because we are shooting for example
and doing a little bikini haul because
they're my favourite bikinis and then
they reached out we're like oh we love
to send you bikinis to do a haul video
so that's what we're doing right now
just to let you guys know why we're in
Miami I know it was kind of confusing
but we just ordered Starbucks I'm one of
the people that works here it was like
wait you want coffee
we don't have iced coffee but there's a
Starbucks inside knows like don't want
to go inside and wait in line to get it
so they were like wait me and go for you
so it was like oh my god that's so
amazing in a cage didn't take credit
card no best thing ever and you guys
remember my last Miami vlog Kayleigh and
I would go to friends this literally
tastes a crunch right now with chefs
Starbucks about coffee with almond milk
in it
but in my last manly fog when I was here
I was talking about how I loved you
probably not what I was talking about
how I liked having a charge with ease
and that everyone should get a chart
engage and then I go to fold and now I'm
a target my feels like dying
oh man off I just went swimming I'm so
amazed but I'm gonna run them to the
beach or not the beach I wanna be trying
out what am I saying the water and show
you guys just cuz it's so pretty oh my

was right this place literally reminds
her of Bermuda the water's so clear and
only a three hour plane ride from Boston
and look at that
hi oh hi oh look at my blog oh you can
be there hi mom you can't really see it

swimming by that's cute I was so
confused I thought Gretchen was like
talking to a friend but she was talking
to a subscriber so if you're watching
this video hi who's nice to meet you
over now
okay now I'm gonna go for tanning oil on
like because it's really good
to tan after you go swimming in the
ocean just because the saltwater and
stuff that makes it so you get a little
more tan I don't know why this just soy
that it is interval life I don't come
back what a shame I mean I thought crab
cakes and then a veggie hummus sandwich
so that's about you have me sit veggie
hummus sandwich obviously and then
underneath some red chilli crab cakes
like those look really cute and good wow
I'm like excited can we take these chips
are the best ideas like munching Kaylee
loved these when he came here is that
mustard I'm gonna love mustard do you so

I eat me too I hate capture hoods it has
like sugar in it that freaks me out take
