channel today's the video I'm going to
be showing you what my actual skincare
routine I just woke up I'm about to wash
my face and I just wanted to show you
guys what I use because everything that
I have that I use every single morning
our products that I absolutely love I've
been using them for so long
so I know that I really like them
and they work really well on my skin so
I just wanted to share these products
with you and kind of go through like
what I do and like wash my face and show
you how I do that every single morning
and I will have all of these products
linked down below for you if you want to
check them out and without further ado
let's get started
and it the first thing I do before I
start my skincare routine and wash my
face is I just put my hair back in a
little low bun because it's the worst
when you're trying to wash your face and
your hair is in your face so first I'm
going to be going in with my absolute
favorite face wash and I just use the C
to felt gentle skin cleanser you can get
this at any drugstore but this is the
one that I use so I just take a little
pea-sized pump of that on my hand and
then I will rub it together and apply
that all over my cheeks and my chin and
then my forehead and I do this when my
face is still dry just because it kind
of feels like a lotion then I'm going to
go in and turn the water on rinse my
hand and rinse all of it off my face
then I'm going to drive my face off with
a little towel and when I dry my face I
always Pat it to dry you never want to
rub your face just because when you get
older it can cause wrinkles so oh it's
just Pat it to dry and the next step
that I usually do is I use these same
eyes even a bright pink lemon and
mandarin orange scrub on my face I use
this as my exfoliator and we try to do
this at least once a day I know you're
not supposed to exfoliate your face more
than a few times a week but I just feel
like when I do this every single day it
just really helps even out my skin and
make it bright and kind of get rid of
all of the imperfections on it since you
are getting rid of all of the dead skin
cells when you exfoliate your skin I'm
not going to be exfoliating my face
right now because I usually like to do
it in the shower and I'm not taking a
shower right away so I'm gonna save that
for when I do take a shower but the next
step is I go in with my favorite toner
and it's very important to put a toner
on your face after you wash it just
because it'll prep your face for the day
or night whatever time you are washing
it and just get rid of all of the dirt
and access like oils and things that are
on your face from when you wash it with
your cleanser so the toner that I use is
my absolute favorite I've been using it
since August
it's the Kensington apothecary rose
water exfoliating tonic it comes in this
glass bottle with this little pump which
I absolutely love so I'm gonna take a
little cotton pad and then put a little
pump of the toner on it and then just
rub that on the forehead down on my
cheeks on the chin nose and then repeat
it until my face feels
but once I'm done applying my toner the
next step is I use a serum and this one
is because into the box carry ageless
beauty skin serum again I've been using
this product since August it's my
absolute favorite so with the serum I'm
just gonna take two little pumps in my
hand like that rub it around and apply
this all over then I'm just gonna let
that dry before putting on my
moisturizer so the next step is
moisturizing it's so important to
moisturize your face the one that I use
is the oil-free Neutrogena sensitive
skin moisturizer some people have told
me of that they said that this
moisturizer is not good for your skin
but it is oil free and I have eyelash
extensions and I used to use the
Cetaphil to any moisturizer but that one
contains something that would break down
the glue in my extensions so I stopped
using it when I moisturize my face I
just take a little pump this on my hand
usually just like a pea-sized and then
I'll rub that around my fingertips and
apply it to my cheeks chin nose and
forehead sorry a finishing touch in my
routine I am going to be putting on some
of my favorite chopstick I just use the
Burt's Bees vanilla bean and I feel this
chopstick is so hydrating and nourishing
for your lips and it also adds a little
shine which I absolutely love
okay last but not least my favorite step
of them all I'm going to be applying the
fresh rose water spray all over my face
I just recently got this a few weeks ago
if you saw my little
the log from I think it was like a week
and a half ago I just recently got this
and I you see you see Mario Badescu
rose water spray but I just feel like
this one feels a lot more fresh on your
skin and it just leaves it feeling
weightless and doesn't feel like there's
anything like sticky on it so I'm just
gonna spray a few pumps of this on my
face I got it sold freshening and now
I'm done and before I end the video I
just wanted to share which makeup
remover I would use if I was taking off
my makeup and I just used the CFL gentle
makeup remover it looks like this you
can get it at any drugstore I use this
one because it's oil free again and I
have eyelash extensions so I can't use
any products that have oils in them
because they will break down the glue
adhesive so I just use this one I've
been loving it lately I have no
complaints about it it takes off my
makeup great
I do miss using my micellar cleansing
water I think I can still use it last
time I went in to get my eyelashes
filled Amy who does my eyelashes said
that I can use some my seller runner so
I just wanted to finish this before I
started to use that again because I do
like that that was my ride-or-die so
that concludes my everyday skincare
routine again I have all of these
products linked down below for you and
another tip that I have for having a
clear and glowing skin is drinking a lot
of water and trying to eat healthy I
admit that I obviously don't need
healthy all the time but I try to 80% of
the time and I think that that helps a
lot because what you put into your body
is what is going to help reflect it on
the outside so if you put good things in
your body and keep yourself hydrated
it's gonna really show in your skin if
you guys would like to see a morning
routine or a night routine just give
this video a thumbs up leave all of your
comments
down below thank you so so much for
watching this video and I will see you
in my next one
