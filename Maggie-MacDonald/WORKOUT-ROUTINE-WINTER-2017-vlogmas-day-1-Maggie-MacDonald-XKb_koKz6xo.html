workout routine video coming live for
you I am getting ready to go to the gym
but first I'm having a little
pre-workout snack because I only ate
breakfast I haven't eaten lunch yet
so this is what I'm having I'm just
having a rice cake with I'm salted
chunky peanut butter from Trader Joe's
with some cut-up bananas a few almonds
and some fruit but first if you guys
really know me you know that I have to
take a snap of what I eat before I eat
it so if you're not following me on
snapchat you totally should I will put
it on the screen so I'm gonna eat this
and then head to the gym and I will see
you there and the first thing I do right
when I get to the gym is I just put my
hair in a ponytail and then I put on my
headphones and start up my Apple watch
just putting it on the setting that I am
using for whatever workout I'm doing
then I go into my Spotify and I pick
whatever playlist without I'm really
feeling at the moment you guys can
follow me on Spotify I'll have
everything linked down below then I
start my treadmill workout I am going to
put the incline up to nine in the speed
up to 3.6
and I am just gonna walk uphill on the
treadmill for at 45 minutes so while I
do this
I usually just check all my social
medias I'll watch a few YouTube videos
just do anything to kind of make the
time go by faster and then halfway
through when it hits the 25 minute mark
I will turn around and walk uphill
backwards on the treadmill and I'll do
this for 10 minutes before turning back
around at 35 minutes and finishing the
last 10 minutes going forward then I
always make sure to end my workout with
a cool down just to a kind of slow back
down my legs and get them back to
feeling normal again after I finish my
cardio I will be at doing an ab workout
and this one I just made up by myself I
just took all of my favorite app
workouts and I put them into one and you
can do any outro felt that you're
feeling you can find one online on
Instagram Pinterest whatever it may be
those will all work fine I just decided
to do this one today because I don't
like to do the same ones all the time
and they just switch it up so this is my
advocate that I'm doing today I'll just
go through the exercises that I'm doing
and you can look at them and follow them
along I will try to link the names to
all of them it's down below just to kind
of give you a little guide but like I
said I am NOT an expert I'm not like a
fitness person this is just kind of like
my own personal preference and the
things that I like to do
then to end my workout I'm just going to
be doing some stretches because you
don't want to injure yourself it's so
important to stretch after workout just
to reduce the risk of getting hurt so
I'm going to be doing a few stretches
now and just making sure that I stay
hydrated while doing so and yeah so that
will complete my workout routine so I
just got back from the gym I'm super
sweaty I need to go take a shower but I
figured that you guys would have some
questions about where I got my outfit
and like what headphones I use and
things like that so I just wanted to
show you I use these wireless beats and
I have the black and gold ones and I am
wearing this sports bra from forever 21
I ended up buying it for one of my
Halloween costumes that I wore I was
being a boxer so I got this to wear with
my costume but I actually really like it
and it's one of my favorite sport to us
that I own and then I am just wearing my
favorite Lululemon aligned leggings and
these are the black ones then for shoes
I'm just wearing my adidas nmd sneakers
and I will have all of these items
linked down below for you and I get so
many questions on what Apple which I use
and this is my Apple watch it's just the
series one gold Apple watch sport with
the cream-colored band and I hope you
guys enjoyed today's video I've been
getting so many requests to do a workout
routine video and I just wanted to let
you guys know that I like to do 45
minutes of cardio every single time I
workout it kind of reminds me of a soul
cycle class because soul cycle classes
are around 45 minutes so I like to do 45
minutes of cardio a day and then
sometimes I do a little ab workout
sometimes I might do like a little arm
workout a leg workout but I don't do
them every single day for me the most
important part is is eating healthy and
having a good diet I don't think working
out like has that much to do with like
how I look for me at least because I
don't do a lot of lifting I don't really
lift weights I don't like lifting
weights so I think it's genetics what
you eat and I don't know just like
taking care of your body everybody is
different so no bodies are gonna look
the same I just wanted to let you guys
know because I have been getting a lot
of questions about that but be calm
in your own skin you are you and you're
you for a reason everybody's different
and I think that that is the coolest
thing ever you are so unique and just
embrace who you are and how you were
created and yeah so I'm gonna end
today's video there I hope you guys
enjoyed it give this video a thumbs up
if you would like to do like a workout
outfit video because I've been loving
the forever 21 sports bras and I just
ordered a ton of new ones but if you
guys want to see like what I wear when I
work out just give this video a thumbs
up leave all of your comments down below
and thank you so much for watching this
video and I will see you in my next one
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
