alright since we've returned because um
you know bitches like us got lies and
shit like that
so I want to say I appreciate everybody
but I got to say something real quick so
you guys know I put up the pro the first
promo for Malibu kids and you know
everybody was given support and things
of that nature but it was one particular
person as you can see on your screen
right now read what she said mm-hmm
bring only that one always that one with
no video you know and I don't want to
hear nobody in the comments said you
didn't have to do that I know what I
don't have to do but this is what I
wanted to do she basically said in so
many words
Juha my videos gonna sound like you're
supposed to you seem like you let the
fan get to your head what is wrong with
you
you promised that she was gonna upload
back-to-back three weeks ago and you
still ain't did it when the last time
you sat down and did an actual topic Oh
guess what she said to me hmm
well miss keeping it real since we
keepin it real let me tell you something
real quick okay one I don't get paid for
this shit this is a pastime Lee sure
this is not a J Oh motherfucking B so
until you start giving me some money
shut up cuz you know what I could do
what I couldn't do real quick I can
charge 399 through YouTube per video and
then y'all have to pay to watch this
shit that's what you could do you know
but I don't do that because it's not
necessary okay this is a free service so
we gonna keep it free so you can't get
mad and free shit how the fuck you gonna
give me some free anyway you give me a
free t-shirt and that's it I don't like
that color you got a dollar right and I
want it now
my bitches free why are you what you
complaining about what really you you
press them out the fact that I'm not
making and this is not just miss keeping
it real this is
a lot of other people who want to help
myself him broken about videos listen
here as much as you guys may enjoy these
videos these would not pay the bills
okay we have lives we have to make let
me just I can't stop my work to sit down
and make a video okay
sometimes a bitch is tired from work
well I'm not in the mood to do videos
the only difference between now and
before is the fact we would do so many
videos at one time and then I will
upload them in an orderly fashion a
bitch been someone from the entire bitch
I ain't even had time to do more than
one you know so yeah so off her and she
blocked by the way yeah girl
well that's a good huh huh she did for
other shit dude
she was like oh your best friend to
unblock me I didn't like him ever but
now I like him oh fuck she is my machine
getting unblocked bitch you gonna stay
block you ain't gotta like me bitch a
bitch a man like this so anyway off that
we're gonna get to the topic at hand
which is ten reasons why y'all a
relationship ain't working and if you
add into this if you come to the
conclusion that your shit is all this
shit I think it's out for you and the
boo to call it quits
alright so the first one is Twitter if
you and your bang got Twitter don't and
I'm gonna tell you why because this is
what bitches do on Twitter they get up
they find out somebody's in a
relationship and they find out a way to
sabotage the shit that's what they do
it's a lot of hateful bitches in this
world that don't wanna see nobody happy
and they will go in fucking or that your
boyfriend
follow right she's gonna follow me back
follow for follow DM what's up you got
bbm yeah hit me up uh honey you got some
ass shots you got some big shots yeah
that's technically cheating that's wrong
you fucking up you fucking up and all
y'all leave oh my god
forgive me like that
or Twitter when you see people on your
doing this you know I'm a simple type
motherfucker who ain't doing no immoral
shit you know I'm saying but then you
turn around and watch they retweets and
they retweeting oh what's up you ain't
called me back last night I think you
lying about the person you are sir
Facebook same thing he was playing
Facebook number this number too fucked
up a lot of happy homes on say this part
this Twitter - Twitter face yeah but
it's the worst on Twitter comes a bitch

top of it be something about this bitch
and in this fishery to Facebook you know
what's going on it in the inboxes
yes oh and please y'all say who your
relationship with us oh you're not

that's the problem like our fucking
Twitter when you find uh somebody
relationship to your Facebook it's right
there oh yeah man was hitting me up
bitch lay there anything like that
but speaking of Facebook let me say guys
will happen so you guys know I'm friends

side note of a side note I can't add
nobody else on Facebook week I'm a on

one email it's okay

problem and let me tell you something to
Nick and this is for the ones who each
evening sure this is some word of advice
to you so you won't look stupid remember
on Twitter when you sign up for Twitter
you gotta send it with email address
okay if your girlfriend or your
boyfriend has your email account number
or goat order account password I mean I
can't remember this thing's amazing
right your email the password from
either one remember Twitter sends an
email to you every single time you get a
DM or or at message now so don't think
you slick cuz she got your Twitter
password and you won't delete all that
messages but if she check your shit

humanized brother it was so obvious
it was like oh you get that it was two
basketballs and healing like he was at
least six for two and he just like I'm
dead I will show you guys when we finish
okay next step right sorry too sociable
oh yeah what you know it's cool to be
such cool people this could be you know
friends or whatever but some people are
just way too um they just want to be
friends with everybody
no you have to watch that in a
relationship and somebody wants to be a
little too friendly with everybody
because some people like that are
usually people who want to fuck
everybody
you know I know people like that I know
of people like that where you know they
have their pick of who they like but
when they're hard up one night they'll
pick out of that little people who they
run in order
- you know for you it don't ya they're
just a little too sociable for their own
good where I just kind of make you be
like damn do the heart talk exactly like
yeah the gay community is small so I can
understand that but why you know what
everybody I don't know what everybody
maybe don't you remember me from where I
had one girl they come to me like you
know every black person know you know
you know every chicken head with a bad
week cuz you got one to family right
next my lion if you in a relationship
with anybody and they lie often how did
you trust them I mean if you are in this
below please let me know how you know
this works out for you because I don't
understand you know and this is the
reason why I don't mess with dealin
because they lie cuz they say they're
not gay it's in a not bisexual with
something when people tell you bisexual
they just a big company cuz there's more
acceptable actual bisectors we would
actually like women to but I think they
got a stronger feeling for man than they
do women I think women are just say what
I think it is wait lion okay sorry yeah
I'm rusty at this but yeah lion if
somebody's racing we went about the deal
man you're lying about what you are to
me and then I'm open is a month fucking
book I'm fuck what you mean I'm Aryan
forever I don't care but if you're lying
to me that means that you're lying about
pretty much anything anything else could
be a lie because you're not telling me
the truth right now you're not you think
you're too caught up in what other
people are thinking to even tell me how
you really feel
anybody am
you find me up hello so as long as you
believe it I'm gonna pull somebody
uncle's these two too so and then it's
just and other stuff too if an
essentially if people just lie about
tedious shit did you take out the trash
nobody tried you still up in here I took
the bag out what was that a lot you
should've just said no you people like
that you gotta watch them cuz they lie
about anything you go no time for you
let it live and make up shit like that
fast and me turn around and get caught
up in their lives it looks stupid
I also use somebody as an example but
I'm good I would just like to say if me
you right we can go anyway
okay say weed I had like a bomb as we
can and we meet up with someone and they
just come up with this whole story after
we told our story and be lying like
every night like it was these girls
but anyway lying not acceptable that is
not gonna work for your relationship
they don't work like is occasional
honesty if you hang on honesty you
negotiate then we are friends that fuck
basically anywhere next penny shit I
just met someone who is like really
petty they get mad over the little issue
I'll argue over this small issue
you put the butter over a on the butter
bitch really I think people do that you
know they just want some attention
yeah that and this man is listen if
you're in a relationship with somebody
and they do that all the time why don't
you stay first tomorrow tomorrow no well
you know what be peace out gone gone
anyway well yeah I mean if their petty
over a little bit like
that's just honest that's childish you
know kids fight over toys so why are you
guys fighting over a phone call you find
him who why'd he call you but how's my
daddy what is he what it may be like you
looked at me wrong I don't like the way
you looked at me you looking into my
eyes well I mean I was taught as a kid
to make eye contact because that's a
proper or don't thing to do right do you
think imma see into your soul or
something would you hide it so ya
pettiness is unnecessary NIST lack of
respect now this is the last but not
least if you are in a relationship you
know what good you take this led to
respect if you was in a relationship and
somebody came at you pal what that is
but let's just say you were in a
relationship right and the dude came in
you and was like you know what you
acting like a stupid-ass bitch and got
in your face that was doing all this you
would see every ex you got me fuck I
don't like who you think you talking to
really anyway there's like no but yes
yeah
he is something else on camera it is
something else
say yeah yeah well then those are the
top 10 things that you should keep an
eye on in your relationship if you if
any of those things come up about time
ago time ago
it's time to go cuz ain't shit on that
list fixable farang shit on that legs
this list fixable nothing only thing you
can do is delete your Facebook or your
Twitter
anyhow my fuckin but nah sorry nothing
cool because they can keep doing it if
people turn full of friendly flirting so
they say well the Aten disk icon I could
change give it up to the person I got
these shirts sure and show the be cut in
the nappy-ass pubic hairs like who wants
to see that
Hakone all below no no letter S shit is
fixable because that stuff that's good
and most of that shit or that list
instead of they been doing you can't
meet nobody on Twitter and Facebook and
expect them to change that won't work
you can't you can't no trust me oh let
me tell you let me tell you because it's
totally different you got a man who
