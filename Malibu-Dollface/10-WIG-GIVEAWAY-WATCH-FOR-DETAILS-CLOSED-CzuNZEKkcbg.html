something that I was brewing let's move
this way for August first
and today it's definitely August 1st so
and from the title you guys know that I
am definitely doing a wig giveaway I am
giving away 10 of my pre owned wigs
these wigs will range from wigs that I
have constructed myself up in to wigs
that I have review for companies like
RPG show divas wigs premier lace wigs
just a plethora of companies that I
review for and these are ways that I
just have no use for them so I am still
going to have a wig sale however for
this just because I want to give people
who don't either have the money or
people who have been through things like
you know uh cancer or they have had
lupus or things of that nature and they
do want hair and this is gonna give them
a chance so I can give back to you guys
because you guys give so much to me so
five of the wigs will be for cancer
slash lupus survivors or anybody who has
went through any type of hair loss
alopecia anything like that and then the
other five will be just for my regular
subscribers okay and I'll do this quite
often because I've accumulated like two
big-ass things but buckets of hair and I
do I can't I'm drowning in hair right
now so um this is gonna give them a
chance to kind of pick what they want
and then once those are given away I
will do a wig cell which then you guys
will be able to purchase pre only
because that I have already reviewed and
at war so the only thing that you have
to do is write in the comments below why
you feel as if you should deserve set
hair and once you do that then and make
sure you guys put your Instagram because
that's the way I'll be able to contact
the winners this will run into the first
of next month so this is going to be a
30 day thing and everybody that I do
pick you
we'll have dibs on pretty much any wig
that I've ever reviewed unless I tell
you that it's not available but aside
from that most of them are available to
be given away and they will be available
for purchase so yeah just put your story
you know you don't have to make it super
long but just kind of vaguely go over
with it which you've been through and
for those who are just entering just
because let me know what why you want
the way you could be financial issues
and you don't have to go into depth
about it but just kind of you know what
this will do I understand as a person
who does this that unless especially for
women
one thing things that make you feel
womanly such as maybe your breasts and
you go through breast cancer or your
hair you know it makes you feel
beautiful and these things are taken
away from you because of unfortunate
circumstances that have come into life I
want to feel like I do my part to give
back and this is why it's taken me so
long to do this because I wanted to just
have ample material to just kind of give
back to people I get so much hair and
I've just been kind of hoarding it for
this you know so yeah make sure you guys
are subscribed to me make sure you guys
follow me on instagram at malibu da face
as well as snapchat just make sure you
subscribe is a requirement um and they
just put your story below and i'll
definitely pick ten people that I feel
are the most deserving for the giveaway
and then the sale will start and then
yeah I'm marking everything 50% off so
if the wind was 500 dollars then you're
on another pay 250 for a week and though
it was a hundred so yeah I'm trying to
give everybody a chance cuz I feel like
everybody is all that and I've been so
blessed and it's presenting this avenue
to do so much I just want to give back
to you guys
so it starts today good luck to everyone
it will end on August 1st and 11th in LA
time I mean September 1st at 11:10 LA
time so good luck to everyone I'm
excited to read your stories and y'all
have a
when I'm a catch all that my name's for
burgers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
