gonna make this video very long
the winners of my giveaway are so
everyone who have entered thank you so
much for entering this was very
time-consuming in a great way cuz I got
to okay we're gonna put the names away
before I get to that all the winners
that I have just listed have already
been contacted so therefore all you
scammers you can't go ahead and I make a
page with those names because those
people have already been notified and
I've already gotten addresses about
sending out the week that they requested
so thank you to everyone who entered if
you did not win please don't feel
defeated
trust me life is always a race and
sometimes you win and sometimes you lose
but there are no losers here because I
will start my WIC sale on September 25th
so you guys got a little bit of time to
kind of square way I guess money or just
time to know when it's gonna happen so
September 25th will be the official date
now what's gonna happen is once I are
gonna do about five to ten wigs at a
time it's not gonna be my entire
collection is gonna be available to buy
so what's gonna happen is I'm if you
don't have instagram make one if you
don't have snap checked maybe one make
one because i'm gonna start to like
blast out when new wigs are updated on
site as they sell out or you know so
just keep a lookout on the ones that you
might possibly want if you are
interested in something feel free to
send me an Instagram message and ask me
under any of these blasts if this
particular wig is available if it was
sold or whatever so yeah you guys have
to keep your eyes open for it but
September 25th will definitely be the
day that you guys get your opportunity
to buy wigs and half off the price so
again thank you to everyone i literally
read every single comment it was 4,000
plus and i was reading him from the day
i posted that video up literally until
last night um to just it was just a lot
and it was a lot of good it was a lot of
bad and shout out to every
who's going through something right now
I totally can sympathize with you and
for the people who have won I hope that
my point of doing this was to help and I
hope that I achieved that goal in
helping others because I've been so
immensely blessed so I just wanted to
give back and trust me I will do this
again so those who aren't feeling and
probably a little bit of defeated right
now
trust me I've lost in certain situations
so much but when it was my time it was
my time so thank you guys for entering I
truly enjoyed this and I will catch you
guys in my next getaway and as well as
my next video love you
peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
