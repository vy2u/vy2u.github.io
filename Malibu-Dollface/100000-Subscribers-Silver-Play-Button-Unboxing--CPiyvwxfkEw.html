know what the package is all i know is i
believe i know what it is and if this
video goes live and is it what i thought
it was okay so you guys know that a
while ago i passed 100,000 subscribers
and on youtube when you hit a milestone
like that um they send you a plaque or
whatever and I knew that I was gonna get
one I just didn't win cuz you know
youtubers a little slow with his book so
I was like it's crying I was seeing
people like um start to finish mua my
girl Missy I talked to her about it and
she was like they asked in her
notification in February or whatever and
she had just seen it but it came like in
two weeks and it tells you like six to
twelve weeks that it's gonna come and
I'm just like oh god I'm gonna get this
until I get like 300 of subscribers
probably so when I was looking for the
email i could not find it other people
like nobody who does he unboxing
actually tells you what to do to redeem
it they just tell you that they got it
and that was it mine's did not come in
an email so if you're watching this and
you waiting for yours to come check your
YouTube dashboard and it should say
claim your prize and it should have a
code that you click on and at Cole order
your your your plaque so I hope I'm not
giving a speech for no reason because if
this is not what this is I it's from
Indianapolis out the videos i order
nothing from army i order something but
it wouldn't matter so let's see if this
is what I think it is yeah this is crazy

have this is she it isn't it just happen
