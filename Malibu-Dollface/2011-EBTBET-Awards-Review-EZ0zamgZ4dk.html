was not going to do a video about this
but today starts my week-long vacation
so I won't be doing any other videos
this week so I said why not knock this
one out before I actually leave so um
would it be in
9:56 in the morning let me do a bt EBT
review okay so we're gonna jump right in
um people for whatever reason want to
know my opinion about this whack-ass
award show so I guess I'm just going in
give you guys what you want and let it
be what it is I watched for pure comedic
purposes I really didn't watch actually
thinking I was gonna see something epic
I think I've been epic but it wasn't a
good epic it was like a ring you know so
whatever um the pre-show I did not watch
the pre-show
I was not here but I did see tweets on
Twitter or Twitter about it once I got
home um I turned it on and I'm gonna
West Coast I'm in California so
therefore it and here in LA
you gotta East Coast offers um but only
thing I remember from actually the
pre-show that I see Harvey was talking
about was back I guess Lloyd was mad
about some shit I personally don't know
why cuz I don't think he had albums in
Street Live and if he had I'm sorry
looks about she's like you um well I
like that album and I like you know your
first album but yeah I don't know why he
was trippin or why he was talking about
retiring videos didn't even do that I
wanted support like I don't know but
whatever I digress love you Lois um
anyway uh the next is the Will and Jada
uh willow and Jaden won for best I guess
cutest motherfucker I don't know shit I
think they won for best teenager or
whatever I was some made of ass fuckin
category today and no other war show but
the fuckin DBT Awards but on another
note
they look very cute they said it was a
tie of course they gonna give them both
for war cuz well over cried and lo I
mean and Jaden what it felt like damn I
said if I can you know my god ah so you
know Will and Jada has something to do
with that but you know love them too
jadon Sackman i love with my hair I mean
20 Christmas tree girl what I didn't
like Jada if you are watching this honey
cuz you know I love me some you peaches
I love me some you but this mm-hmm
remove it that's all i'ma say remove it
remove them okay good you better than
that
you look better than that I'm just
saying I love you grunting just from
from a person to a person that yeah so
often um the next person I think his
name is eight hood if I'm not mistaken
or spayed hood or spayed and neutered
shit I don't know but I just know one
thing I remember from him is his fucking
pants saggin so low that you can just
see his ass and I'm going to say to any
Bracker if you have issues with gay men
looking at you or you don't like gay
people that you are sending out the
wrong message okay because you are
giving the come and get it you know flag
that's like the mmm no so yeah i'm who
loves in that performance i think a
little wang within a performance
hila ties fuck um let me was new though
you know they just listen to his
daughter majide she looked pretty um
wick raw now Ricky ah you are there um
you need a bra okay and fuck with Kevin
Hart I will get him in a second but fuck
the sports bra you need like a
Victoria's Secret nearly D cup bra
sister port lift and separate because
your shit was like ma hood nigga ma hood
like brilli this is what we're doing now
rappers you know if your body is my Fit
he'll take off your name I'm sure you
all got a lot of confidence I will tell
you that much and I respect you for that
manone don't do that please didn't give
you words to do now
you are invited I'm just saying um the
next person is I'll go to Kevin Hart
Kevin Hart was the host um I've never
found Kevin Hart funny maybe it's just
me people think he's hilarious I
personally only display me at all
I think he's corny um he's like Wayne's
Corning um but you know whatever
get your money maybe I'm Friday played
paid you and EBT increments so do your
line
I'm just so mean um yeah other than that
I didn't find Kevin Hart because only
thing I've actually involving him I
found to be comedic with the roja the
real house husbands of Hollywood I guess
is what it was called our Los Angeles or
you know fucking I don't know but um
yeah that was the only thing I found and
I she only really like that because
Bobby Brown Oh thick ass swole face ass
was there Nellie you know easy looking
good and stuff um ain't my girl Tami
that was about it
other than that I'm good um and who else
was there
Nick Nick was there and she looked the
worst um but you know I digress
um that was about it the next person is
Chris Brown
you know I I haven't spoke about Chris
Brown's and you know he nunchuck Rihanna
but you know I actually liked deuces and
um some his older stuff but this new
stuff I'm not feeling I did like his
Hammer pants though those was don't just
talk about weirdos you know but for him
not really that fucking hard you know
Chris you know we ain't here but you
know whatever um me I would wasn't
feeling those um pants much sorry
um it was something else about him Oh
the girl you screwed up the whole
situation I was being her fault because
BTS fucked up an ad that shit on purpose

trying to be some other shit I done did
it all wrong
we'll see you having it into your words
um hold on let me get my list cuz I'm
going by pure ass pictures right now
her um now now Nikki motherfucking Minaj
you know just when I thought everything
with her was good and all the antics was
done this bitch decided to come to the
BT Awards and act like motherfucking who
did what with four and I'm surprised so
she was in a category with Lola Monroe
diamond some other bitch in some other
bitch and only people I knew was her and
Lola and I'm in it was like I guess it
was the damn I don't know but whatever
so she gets up there reenactment oh my
god I can't believe I won everybody
laughs because they know you know damn
well bitch she was your only competition
you knew you won one though whatever
offer Eileen was talk about it no more
cause it's a month like mockery Beiteinu
de bazan given and she like they only
put that category up there because of
her if it was just no Nicki Minaj it was
Lola Monroe and I'm in another bitch
they would ascribe that whole category
and said it's alright we hang on dude is
what what the fuck with my what who the
fuck is diamond I mean I know what I

another one with the hairline problems
his hairline goes like this you see the
direction of our braids his hairline
goes like this
so therefore tuo is to reverse it really
goes like this
um but your hair is blond so you would
think that all of that coat effect nish
going on you would want to not put no
stress on your hair such as blonde hair
dye begetting still you so that was okay
because it made your hairline look like
it protruded forward life okay that's
like a black girl blue eye shadow wrong
so anyway off that um no no no the girl

look on your face that you get when you
thought you gave the wrong shoes okay

bit risque for yo yourself isn't it hmm
who is this bitch oh jelly motherfuckin
rollin now before I get to Kelly let me
get straight on now Trey Songz gave us
what he always give us mediocre vocals
you know like what I don't like yo
Scrappy Doo voice I really don't um you
know when he tries all the tempers in
that he resorts to wood wool and get him
hot you know I'm sayin and get him some
applause because the vocals are
definitely ain't getting it so you know
when all else fails ie the vocals let's
take off the shirt his shirt was like
rigged to just come open you know he's
just like okay okay so what's new this
is like a regular concert you really
didn't do nothing but come down some
stairs mm-hmm sorry you know I'm looking
for somebody beyond motivation
Kelly came out Kelly I am very proud of
you as a longtime Kelly Rowland fan I
have our albums on compact discs and I
love me some Kelly I feel like Kelly has
always been robbed as I stated in the
previous video um for certain things so
I'm very happy to see that Kelly is
actually getting her shine and doing she
gotta do to get there and Mama performed
her ass off she perform like she lived
in an old house for about 13 years
so shout out to you shout out to Beyonce
Tina Matthew salon
Jules um everybody cuz you did that shit
for real though um but you know Kelly
you know you grind it girl you just you
were just ro Sencha with it but I love
you and I love that performance but I
have to be fair you did not seem like
that was a live backing track because
she missed a quite a few of her ad-libs
um but that's not taking anything with
her because it's not uncommon with in
live performances Brandi did it
Beyonce has done it I believe what she
wants artists to do it especially when
it's a lot of strenuous dancing a lot of
artists cannot keep up their stamina to
you know give you great notes but other
than that Kelly you killed it and you
did pay homage because a lot of people
do not pay homage these days but I'm
just saying um and I'm not talking about
Nick knows but yeah you you know paid
homage to Janet and I love the fact that
you did that and your own special with
you because Kelly came out like she was
at a funeral it was like I'm Michael
Moore knees bitches I'm going in my
church clothes you know anything like
these bitches I'm out to kill all I
might just murder you hoes and I'm
dressed for your funeral already Carrie
Sierra you know you know they're in
murder days oh but this bitch puts the
nail in the coffin shout-out to Sierra
um
but Kelly killed is like I was very
proud of her that bitch came out like I
nobody thinking rape bitch I'm no longer
a motherfucking like dancer for Beyonce
I'm not a backup singer for Beyonce I'm
bad bitch so shout-out to you miss
Rowland I'm at calandria you did it
bitch
um let's see when Tony tria Michelle
would the fight support one of those Who
am I fooling my show can under drew but
anyway um I think that was it I think
that was my see that's it
oh the tributes at CEO you only feel oh
that's what i'ma leave that shit only
fuckin CeeLo they gave Steve Harvey some
award for some
I'm so over Steve Harding it bullshit
Miguel I don't know you think I think
you weren't it outfit before I don't

got there girl but I hope you enjoyed
yourself dirty money

to take the damn crap ends out like what
I don't know who this woman is right
here I can't
Alicia mother you guys know I don't
really care too much for these geez I
heard music individually just bores me
but on top of all of that she the day
one or two things one she took a nap
before she got on stage or to her
mashanda had it in the back cuz her
motherfucking hair was so happy it
wasn't just regular nappy it was like
Beyonce baby boy nappy like it was just
like are you going for a theme here like

there with the growing on there like
which you need I'll come somebody said
on Twitter she needs some Jam like she
girl that baby got you down I mean I
understand what you're trying to do you
trying to go with it but I'm not feeling
it at all I think that was pretty much
it so if I let that out anybody
I don't know Patti looked good you know
patios like a drag queen but you know I
love mother Patti or sister Patti or is
it out of ten whatever you wanna call it
I love me some Patti so don't get me
wrong
um I need a baker is gonna need a you
know I need to make her look good it was
what is her name she before with Mary
not it was Anita Baker
no that wasn't either Baker I'm thinking
- Gladys Malik Anita Baker girl I don't
know what happens for you girl but you
need to just chill the fuck out and that
outfit was not for you I'm glad if I
look good but you know she was giving me
a lot of this she did look good um let
me wrap it up wrap it Oh what was vain I
think it was so real and out
and who did the Monday Tuesday Wednesday
you know that's my song and everything
but why did Alexander look like he was
like eating on fucking a roll Oh candy
and shot like tootsie rolls and got just
stuck up in his teeth that's why you
don't do drugs kids that's specifically
why you do not juice but perfectly crack
you know just I'm not just found nothing
he's a cracker cause I don't know what

say is them teeth was not right indeed

you come looking like a towel next year
like what sugar I'm over I'm over I'm
over this award show
EB T's I will give it a femine and only
reason why I gave it those six extra
points is because Kelly that was it
nobody else could do it for me I'm sorry
everybody else's mediocre um Who am I
forgetting Beyonce um her hair was nice
finally girl got the lace redid cuz she
had they're saying we danced and she was
out of Europe and I'm finishing with the
Disneyland or Disney World when she's in
Florida and she have just got the blonde
wig that's on the front of Rob cuz that
shit was stringy so I'm glad she got
some night in the grill bouncy and flowy
I liked it on the performance is to be
expected it's Beyonce she did her thing
um I just didn't like the song like I
just can't get into a song that I just
don't like but other than that I'll give
her a problems beyond saying you did
that um I still don't like your album
but whatever who the fucking my right
miss funny nothing anyway I'm off this
