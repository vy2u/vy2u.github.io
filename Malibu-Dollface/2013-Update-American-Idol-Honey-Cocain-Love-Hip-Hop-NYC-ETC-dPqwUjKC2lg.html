like a couple of days later on when I
usually come back if you guys know me
from my other channel ouch
then you would know that I usually come
back with new videos and like xvi
usually I come back on the latest
birthday just our videos is 18 today so
I'm a little late but excuse me okay
I've been really busy um I got some
stuff that I'm trying to do that
involves y'all so you know be patient
with me but I did want to make this
video to let you guys know that I'm not
gone and I got like a whole bunch of
videos like y'all know my first of all
my computer broke okay that's first and
foremost thing was my phone you know
want to see what happen to my phone if
you follow me on instagram you know this
happened to me the other day so on top
of all of that I got like hella videos
waiting to be uploaded that I did last
year that I never uploaded due to
something like that I just have time to
do it so I will be uploading those cuz I
just didn't doing for like no reason um
yeah I am going to do a like an overhaul
overview type of situation I guess you
could say about what's been going on
currently in the media this is not my
celebrity fuckery video I got to do
those at the crib you know I'm saying
but um for those who are gonna ask this
is still my Sheena's here Emporium here
she sent me I have new hair that's
already like I have already I just
haven't put it in yet due to simple fact
that I just been so lazy to take this
way out but i'ma do it um but yeah
American Idol I watched the first two
hour the first day which was Thursday
and then no Wednesday and then yesterday
I watched it and the only thing I'm
elaborate is on is I don't give a I
don't know who can who can't sing at
this point because everything is about
Nikki and Mariah so yeah so much for
that oh but I will say like I stated
previously in the video before well when
I did the video about the eBay situation
that you video um I did say that Nikki
was fed up with just over Mariah getting
a hard arse and obviously you
can see that I was correct obviously
she's trying to be nice and this
which is just like Darlene oh my god yes
why are you talking to me I gave you
that enough of my face you know I mean
but that's Mariah for you so you expect
that because it's like that MC which you
that's what she does so it is what it is
um I think it's a very entertaining show
I'm just I watched the entire avoid the
voice I mean you got it
Oh x-factor see it's just too much
going on just
um but yeah um I mean these shows are
all the same to me there is no
difference so I really don't see the
point and watching all of them I'm not
gonna watch the season all the way
through just cuz I just don't care I I
don't give a who can who can't sing
but more I have to say when Nicki Randy
Keith I don't give a like if they
spring some on us and bring back
like some you know Paula some maybe
maybe I don't know um what else is going
on they were talking about somebody
wanted me to talk about this this was
like a week ago to have him a Freddie
key I think killed itself and people
were saying it was because of honey
cocaine and then the way she handed her
so I listen I don't know what the
is going on our relationship if they
were if they wasn't if
they was in a relationship but they
wasn't that was her friend those are
homie if that wasn't me I don't
know and honestly I don't care and I
said I wouldn't do a video dedicated to
the situation because I just think that
she's so irrelevant at this point I
don't think she can rap I think she
she's not that cute like she's subpar
when it comes to people like oh she's a
bad bitch and it's just like well I've
seen girls look better than her but
she's not I mean dumber she's not ugly
but so much for that but I just don't
like the way that she handled herself on
Twitter I think it was very tasteless to
sit back and defend yourself in and all
that issues and she made this video
about I didn't know it was real and all
of this and all this and then
listen y'all muhfuckas need to start
keeping your personal Twitter business I
mean your personal business off of
Twitter cuz it's no one's business on
Twitter what goes on between you and
whomever
stop screencap and conversation stop me
I'm saying it's just tacky so stop doing
it okay um I have start watching this
season of love in hip-hop I'm so not
gonna finish it
it's so like 80 else at
the bar so high we're now it's no point
of having a New York like that's how it
is now so I don't really see the point
of them having a TL I mean NYC just
canceled this no one cares
um and just this has been on
Twitter but that was just a quick
overview of what's going on you know Sam
but I will be back with more videos
about things and I'm gonna do celebrity
fuckery in the eyebrow tutorial like I
extra guys on Instagram and all that
good stuff so yeah don't worry I am back
I am coming you wanna have some more
videos we'll have some fun some last
gonna get into some deep I got
another project that I mean I'm say I'm
gonna need your help on 2013 y'all you
know I'm saying am I here start off a
little up I don't know why but
it's getting better you know I'm saying
and I'm still smelling and I'm still
here so I'm thankful to you guys for
still rocking with me this long and you
know I'm saying it's it's a lot going on
so stay tuned it ain't over and we gonna
