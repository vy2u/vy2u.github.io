your 360 look like a nice natural bun as
you can see I'm struggling to put on
here
I'm not gonna cover really the hot glue
that method there's a video for that so
I'll link that below I'm not gonna
really go over sewing neither um
I'm coming skin skin over these things
but it's really going to be about the
placement of the track so how you can
get this to kind of lay as natural as
possible so this is for people who just
want to wear their hair up in a ponytail
all the time not some of the time so
this is for bundles I only use three and
like a quarter of the last bundle and
this is a Brazilian body wave
everybody's favorite so this is what it
looks like before I bleach the not a lot
of people ask why do you bleach nuts
because nobody wants black holes
sticking out the front and this was
already pre plucked so the great thing
about this already being pre plugs is I
didn't have to do any plucking to it I
just have to make sure that those not
there in the front as you can see look
more like a scalp because the way they
punched his hair and was actually superb
in my opinion so I just take the 360 I
put it on my mannequin head inside out
and you can see in the back where the
dots are is where you want to put the
bleach nothing else because you know
you're gonna end up bleaching the hair
so I left it on for 30 minutes and then
here I'm gonna rinse it I used my I
think it's my 50/50 shampoo from yeah my
triple a treat shampoo and the 50/50
conditioner from Giovanni's which I
really like to use on my body wave hair
and I also use my Tresemme conditioner
which I didn't show in the video but
yeah so this is what it looks like
afterwards I like my knots like the
hairline a little bit on the yellow side
because I am so light so it looks like
when I put it on my forehead it looks
like it's coming right out of my scalp
so I like it to be a little bit lighter
so I can make sure it looks flesh and
seamless so you're gonna take this and
you're just gonna cut the entire back
off of it so and a regular frontal you
would just cut obviously just the top
but this goes all the way around so
you're going to cut all of the
off and I like to use a little bit of
lace it kind of reinforces when I'm
gonna sew and I just use a basic sewing
method again I will link a video below
where I talk more in depth about sewing
and how I sew technique I use to
actually sew my front tools or my trucks
in or whatever and this was simple um it
doesn't it didn't take me long this is
the only song that you have to do if you
dude opted for this um method the reason
why I wanted to do this is because
sewing and what I'm about to do will
it's going to take forever and I don't
like that what I call the weave bump
when you see people that he'll have a
weave and because all your tracks have
been put in you know downward to so that
they will lay downward when you put them
up you get that little bump in the back
that looks like you got a weave or you
got a wig on so this is the option if
you don't have like a full lace wig
where you can just throw it up in a
ponytail this would be another option so
I'm gonna take the bundle and we're
gonna do and this is my first time
trying this is I'm going to I started at
the end and I started the back upside
down so instead of going across down
these go around and up in the back as
you can see I tried the first um track I
tried to do it like rot wouldn't have to
cut them and try to go all the way
around but it because it is glue it's
just gonna become a big mess so I just
went ahead and cut it and then I kept
going the great thing about using the
hot glue gun method is that if you do
cut them because the glue seeps into the
actual web's it pretty much seals your
tracks for you so you don't get no
shedding at least I personally or nobody
I know does this has had that issue so
at this point I started to realize okay
well it'll be smarter for me to go ahead
and just do them section by section so
do the top section first and then we're
gonna flip it so we're gonna just pretty
much do
two crescent moons you're gonna do a you
know Crescent at the top and a question
at the bottom and they're going to need
that's how all your tracks are going to
be separated because doing it all
once is it's kind of hard because it
just gets tangled everywhere but this is
a good method to use when you're using
like inexpensive hair or hair you
already have you can just pretty much
take this and reuse it for something
that you want so you got your ponytail
wig you got your long wig you got your
you know straight wig you know you have
your different options that you can use
instead of throwing the hair out you
could possibly just use it for a natural
bun a workout wig something like that
that makes it a little bit easier to
deal with as opposed to going running
and you're good ish and then you just
kind of lift um so here I'm just going
one bite you know section by section to
make sure that everything is super tight
is flesh it's flat that's our goal here
is to make sure that everything is flat
it lays right like it's supposed to and
also you want to also remember that make
sure that your ends are always down to
because there's nothing worse than
somebody talking and then their wig
their wig or their weave has a you know
the end of your truck is just saying
hello how you do how you doing I can see
you I hope you know that so here I just
went ahead and restarted because this
day I was tired and I had to restart it
for the next day because I had to get up
really early the next day to do
something so this was the continuation
of what I did for the previous day
are you a person who works somewhere
where you have to wear a ponytail or you
have to wear a bun and you don't like
that we bump look this will be perfect
um 360s are to me my favorites I take
these over take these over frontals any
day when I first was introduced to them
I was scared shitless because I didn't
know exactly what they were like what to
do with them but they are great they
give you much more of a natural look and
it's easier to to my opinion to wear and
put on so I believe that this was the
last bundle and I think I just used a
few and I left the middle I didn't want
to crowd the middle with a lot of tracks
because then once you start putting your
ponytail and you don't want it to be so
thick where it just doesn't hold it's
just you know I wanted to actually look
like I pulled it into an actual ponytail
I did more of a loose button here but
I'll do another video where I actually
apply it with the guys to be glued in
that whole thing I didn't really do it
in this video only because I wanted to
make sure that I you know had enough
time and it just wasn't lengthy for no
reason so I'll do another video where I
actually apply it with the actual blue
but I did the glueless method in and as
you seen in the beginning of this video
to kind of show you guys exactly what um
what it will look like once you put it
on and you don't have to glue it down
you don't have you know at all you know
you can wear this with a headband
without a headband and you can be just
fine and as you can see I'm going ahead
and gluing it down in the front here and
this is really I was like okay I think
this is where I'm gonna probably end up
stopping because I don't want it to be
super full wearing four bundles in a
ponytail is not the same as wearing four
bundles in a wrap it's very different so
you got to be a little more on the
mindful side when it comes to the amount
of hair that you're willing to actually
put into the unit if you do if you're
trying to make it look as natural as
possible you and I'm saying like nobody
should be that thick and it's actually
theirs
especially in a ponytail area
okay so this is probably the last couple
of trucks that I used um I think I did
like one more at the time possibly I
don't remember but this was it for the
back and just to close it up and mind
you this style is meant to be in a
ponytail it's not necessarily meant for
you to wear down um but the point of the
360 is to be able to do all of that with
it I just personally wanted to see what
this would look like if I tried it as
opposed to the other way now what you
could do is worm-like because when you
the back ones that are going up when you
try to put your hair down it's gonna
look okay but because it has texture to
it it's not straight it doesn't look as
bad but if you touch it or you throw
your head it's gonna be like why's your
hair sticking up in the back like that
you look a little silly um but I
personally like it especially when I
want to wear a button because I wear
wigs on and off I don't need the
security of wearing you know my hair and
70 different once one wig in 70
different styles I have like 70
different wigs for everything that I
need so you know this is just a option
you may have some old hair laying around
maybe a frontal you use a few times and
you just you know you don't really get
the 360 the first time you can you know
redo it and try this to see if it works
a little bit better for you so here um I
believe this was yeah this was the last
one our second-to-last that I wanted to
do so this one was the one to cover up
and I made it a little bit more spacious
here as opposed to putting the right up
under the other ones and then I just put
this one straight across because I
wanted to leave some space and now this
one was I wasn't gonna put but just to
be on the safe side so there's no gaps
this was actually the last bundle and I
only use this little piece and I have
the rest of that entire bundle left and
this hair was really extremely full and
always said and done but it still looked
natural I still had a natural look to it
so I went ahead and glue that one down
and then once that was done I was done I
cut a little you know a little piece at
the end and I peeled off off camera any
extra glue that I had
and here I just took all of the pens and
the clips and all of that good stuff out
um and you see the little bit of glue
that I do have still in here comes right
on out I didn't show this part cause I
thought I was recording I wasn't but I
just put it in a ponytail and then you
just like peel all the lace upward and
then with the extra cap that you fold it
down in the beginning um you just cut it
out and then you'll be left with that
all in the back and then you have your
entire wig so just cut all the just
because it's a circle so pull the lace
you know up towards the hair and
whatever's hanging out cut off so here I
just wanted to show you guys I pinned it
down to show you why I wanted to put the
bun in it so the hairline is popping and
again it came like this I just had to go
ahead and bleach it um for those who are
new to this use 20 um yeah 20 developer
do not use I use 40 person long but 20
will guarantee that if you accidentally
over bleach or you accidentally leave it
on too long it will not turn a color or
brassy or whatever that you don't need
and you can't fix it or you have to go
through all of these extra chains and to
try to fix it so just use 20 and
gradually work yourself up and keep
checking it and eventually they will
disappear and then you'll end up with
your nice perfect bun now this would
have to band on the back so you can
actually even though I did bleach you
know that is still you can still see
that there's a darker band in the back
I've seen somewhere it doesn't have a
band so you can go ahead and bleach the
but at the back of it and it'll look
like the front but this one this
particular one actually had it where the
band was darker so you can see it
regardless but yeah once I was done I
was able to just simply take my hair and
stuff it in and boom you got a full bun
I think this took me well I did it in
two separate days but time altogether
probably took me about an hour and a
half only because this is the first time
I did it and I had to be a little more
particular I'm meticulous about my trap
placement because the way that I glued
it in but yeah it looks great and it
looks very natural it definitely feels
different
that my other wigs it feels more like
how my hair is when I put it in a bun it
doesn't feel as heavy in the back um and
this is very it's very light but as far
as the heaviness goes it feels a little
bit different I guess because everything
is pinned up to the top and as you can
see in the back I can go ahead and glue
that down if I wanted to and use a
little extra baby here in the back that
they gave you so it can look like it's
all yours
once it's all you know cut out and glue
down so my next video will probably be
sometime next week where I actually do
it where actually glue this one down all
the way around so you guys can see how
it looks only so hope you guys enjoyed
this I hope that this helped a lot of
you guys somewhat and as another option
you don't have the word in a high
ponytail you can also wear it in a low
ponytail as you can see and it'll still
give you the same effect and it still
will look as natural as you want to but
it doesn't have that ugly bump in the
back you know of your tracks because you
pulling them in a scooping up in the
back no that's that doesn't look natural
so I hope you guys enjoyed this if you
have any questions uh please put them
below and the links to this hair will
also be put below as well peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
