pretty much how to I guess you could say
succeed how do to grow your channel
that's a good one how to grow your
channel um you guys know that for a long
time I've been doing YouTube videos and
after my video about not joining a damn
network a lot of people wanted to know
what could they do to I guess expand
their their channels and gain more
subscribers and more viewership so I'm
going to give you some of the tips that
I personally use to help yeah so one of
the first things that I will say is your
presentation um when a lot of us I will
say first started on YouTube we took
what we had to make it what it was now I
have lights and cameras and backdrops
and extra lights but this stuff came
once I establish myself and I was able
to gain money to put back into my
channel so in other words do not spend
two hundred and fifty dollars land on
the camera and then spend three hundred
and fifty dollars on a ring light and
then spend eighty dollars on a backdrop
if you don't have the type of money
coming in to pretty much support this
now if you just have the money laying
around and you just kind of want to
start from the jump with this great but
if you're a person who doesn't just have
which most people do not have a
disposable income or you can just buy
all this stuff
then wait to your channel start to grow
and whatever when I first started I
started in the bathroom because that had
which I totally messed up but that had I
thought the best light in the house
which was it the living room which I let
her move to had the better light so that
means that everything that I did was
limited I cannot do videos at night
which I'm currently doing I could not do
videos while there was a lot of people
in the house I couldn't do videos and be
too loud it was just a lot going on so
um I learned to pretty much work with
the elements
so therefore about a video that I needed
to do or I had something on my chest or
I was to review something I would have
to get up like everybody else in the
world even though I was working from
home and I would have
make sure that I was up by nine to make
sure my makeup was done by 10:00
to make sure the video was done by 12 to
make sure that I had edited throughout
the day so it's up that night that's
pretty much what my days will consist of
so that's kind of one thing that I will
say your presentation means a lot
especially you guys and girls who want
to get into reviewing hair when the
company is looking at who they want to
represent their brand they're looking at
everything it's not just the hair can
you do the hair but how do you look
there's a reason why I don't come on
camera with no makeup unless I'm doing a
makeup tutorial which ain't gonna happen
no time soon but other than that they're
looking for a look the look that I have
was thought out for the hair that I have
for the company that was four so you
have to think about that you have to get
a little innovative in the things that
you do because people want to see
something you can't keep giving people
the same thing and then it kind of like
hmm I kind of like this I kind of don't
and I had to learn the same thing
everybody doesn't like long strand hair
that's my judge but some people do like
shorter hair some people like blond hair
some people like right here some people
like blue hair it just depends and it
doesn't mean that you have to be married
to the idea but make sure that the
company that's giving you the material
that you're selling a material enough
for other people can see their self in
Scent material if that make citizens um
the next thing I will say is make sure
that you are yourself a lot of you guys
know I've been on the internet for quite
some time and you guys pretty much
notice in my attitude hasn't changed
much um
and me the person I've changed a whole
lot from the 19 year old kid that I was
once when I are 18 when I got on here
versus now because I've learned how to
not be so vocal about how I feel even if
I do feel the way you know just you
don't have to tell the world and some
people like that and some people don't
but when you start getting to the point
where your channel becomes sort of a
business then you have to kind of pull
back on your personal feelings now I'll
do a video in a minute about how to funk
I feel but sometimes when people do
videos about other people such as other
youtubers or people that they don't like
or people that there be family it starts
to look unprofessional and a lot of
people just don't want to deal with him
because you just scream drama
and my personal issue with somebody else
I can still address it on my channel but
it's a way I address it versus you
 my mother you
bitch like that's not always the correct
thing to do because especially when
there's a brand that has millions let's
just say Anasazi of Beverly Hills and
I'm working with them and then I get
that's a reflection on her brand even
though I'm just wearing the makeup and
talking about it it's still a reflection
so sometimes you gotta find the balance
you can still be yourself but make sure
that you're not always yourself to the
point people just get like oh my god
bitch something else you know and again
I had to learn that everybody was
doesn't want to know how to cook I feel
about certain bitches cool um the next
thing is be very knowledgeable about the
products in which you are talking about
whether they're sponsored or you brought
them yourself
if I'm talking about a warhead I need to
know exactly what elements went into
making the Hat where the production was
why I don't like it the issues that
needs to be corrected and then some so
be knowledgeable because a lot of this
and um that doesn't work because people
get very very disinterested very quickly
the next thing is editing um a lot of
you guys ask me what do I use to edit I
told you guys numerous times that I use
my iPad to record my videos a lot of you
guys say that you think I'm lying
because the quality is so great but it's
not the pad it's the light so yeah but I
need to see myself because if I don't I
can't you know I know and there's a
little freeze here so I can do this so I
can see myself um but you're aid is
about that's gonna be no matter how
great your makeup your hair and your
edit sucks people are gonna tune out so
every extra there's so many times where
I would wanna rent in a video and I have
to click about two minutes off because
it has nothing to do with what I'm
talking about
so beat yourself in your videos but
sometimes hey when they will they tell
you before you leave the house take two
things off take take about if you got a
ten minute video
take two minutes to three minutes off of
it because people are only gonna be
interested in what you have to say for
so long so make sure you keep it pushing
let's keep it rolling because when you
get stuck you'll be like I'm good
one thing another thing that I find very
funny is that everybody wants to scream
about I'm a brand I'm a brand
everybody's a brand but a lot of
people don't do anything with their
brand so case in point I have built a
lot of great relationships with magic
hair company princess hair shop I was
working with looks addiction at a point
I was working with andis closet it's a
beauty closet for a long time I build
these relationships with these companies
so if I ever need anything or if I ever
want to hold a giveaway or whatever I
have that relationship so that means
that you your brand is helping their
brand and their brand is helping your
brand which is helping you both and get
out there a little bit more a lot of
people on YouTube always talk about
collaborations the issue that I have
with collaborations a lot of time is
that somebody is always going to feel
like they're superior because they have
more subscribers so if me and Jenna
Marbles get together clearly Jenna has
about thirteen million subscribers okay
as opposed to mine's so she would not
really win in this situation she would
probably gain people who don't know her
but I'll probably get the book of the
game so a lot of people say no they
don't want to do it and I kind of I'm
there with that I understand that so
what you do is find someone that you are
equal to find someone who have you had
13,000 and she's at 11,000 you guys are
pretty much equal so you guys can pretty
much help each other but stop reaching
out to people who are a hundred thousand
and you're at a thousand and then you
get mad or nobody replies its again it's
a business it's a popularity contest
because that's what YouTube is so if
you're not gonna and that's just
anything I don't think that Pepsi would
take on Britney Spears if they don't
feel like Britney's fans are gonna buy
their product it does nothing for them
so remember who you are and remember
what Lane you're in when you're in it so
therefore that way when all is said and
done and you need to kind of
move your channel and you need to push
it a little bit you'll have something to
bring to the table because a lot of
people think I'm cute I'm fly I'm this
I'm that everybody gonna love me that's
not true there's some of the cutest
 who cannot hold a
conversation or do what I'm doing to you
right now without people swooning the
 out it's just it's just life
everybody's not given that gift so again
the last thing that I'm gonna say I'll
piggyback enough what I just said is
learn your craft learn your audience
learn to speak because there's nobody in
the wrong with me right now but
myself but you feel as if I'm talking to
you right you have to learn how to do
that it's feel silly at first it's not a
stupid at first but you get used to it
the more natural you are with your
audience the more engaging they're gonna
be when I was doing loving hip hop you
guys loved it because it's like I was a
friend I was sitting on the couch when
we watching the show together and one
more thing make sure you guys are very
very very very detailed and what you're
talking about okay can't be vague
because people are not gonna understand
what you're talking about
I've done that before and then I get mad
when I get all these comments about the
same thing and it's like look just
common sense isn't so common for some
people okay some people need you to go
okay now you you'll walk to the car with
your feet and you do this then you open
the door with the handle and you do this
then you bend your body and you sit your
butt in the chair then you put your feet
and head in the car then you reach for
the actual handle and then you close the
door and then this is where it gets
nervous and nerve-racking you put the
key in and you start the car some people
need that much instruction and I
know that it seems so just uh but you
have to do it because there are some
people who just don't get the
concept you know you can give me about
two directions and I can probably just
go from there some people they need you
to walk them through every thing
so remember that be detailed but I hope
that this helped that you guys have been
each um in each other you guys have any
questions put them below and if I get
enough questions and that I did not
answer then I will do another video to
um pretty much piggyback off this video
for the next one as well as I want to
announce you guys after
or thinking about it I'm gonna do what I
did last year which is I'm gonna do a
video a day me so a lot of those videos
are gonna consist of a lot of things
that you guys have been asking for that
I've already started so that as the days
go by of the month of May you guys can
get your videos um every single day so
we'll talk more about that in my future
videos but I hope you guys enjoyed this
and the review for this hair that I got
on should already be up I'll link the
video below and I will catch you guys in
my next month</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
