and jams keep coming on and all of that
good stuff so I'm just gonna leave it
here and then we don't have to just let
it do what the hell they do so this is
gonna be a quick video update I'll just
curl this part so now I don't want to
stay right you know I wanted to come and
do an update on my hair this if you want
to believe it or not is remember I had
34 inches from glamour angels hair and
it was I had a side part with this
closure and it was really straight and I
did it around the time of my living' Hip
Hop Hollywood reviews I think that was
like one of the first wigs I wore for
that entire series
y'all know I'm doing that Lana on the 20
so um so yeah I just wanted to come back
and do an update on my hair I'll pull it
all this way so you guys can see this is
my hair after I don't know how long I've
had this hair but it's been a minute
since I've had it and I had it tucked
away so yeah I had the hair tucked away
um you guys asked me like how do you
store your wigs I put them usually back
in the boxes and they came in or I have
like a really big box that I just throw
all my wigs in so they I mean ain't
gonna be heard baby alright
so yeah this is the hair on the same
exact hair I've washed and conditioned
it and then what I did was I went ahead
if after I did my review for my
Aliexpress hair I was like never I told
y'all in a review I was like I think I'm
I would do this now but with longer hair
so that's pretty much what I did so I
went and found my 34 inch hair I had to
cut the bottoms of it though
as you can see I had to cut it because
um when you put so many layers and this
hair has a lot of layers in it when you
put so many layers in the hair after a
while you're left with just the back
piece and that back piece be like you
know that then so it looks crazy when
you curl it like this and be just a thin
piece at the bottom so I went ahead and
just um cut it off
so it's problem short of me obviously
it's not 34 inches anymore so it's
probably like around I wanna say 30 now
or 32 possibly cuz remember it is curled
so it is a little shorter because it's
curled but yeah
this air is held up man it's been
through the trenches cuz I had to talk
to me I had to find it I was like what
is my 34 my Barbie hair so I did wear
this on my birthday when I went to
Disneyland and out to eat so thank you
guys all for the beautiful birthday
wishes it was the two of you so yeah
this has been holding up great again
glamour angels hair is one of those
companies that is very um affordable in
my opinion it's very affordable and then
of course my silk blaze closure is from
closest store um I have a whole bunch of
these puppies and I want to get some
more because these are the only closures
that I really like especially sub-base
because they're the right color of my
scalp and a not grey you know I feel
about respect so yeah I just wanted to
come through it really quick and give
you guys an update on this hair this
hair is very Kardashian esque you know
it's still bouncy um it still flows it
still moves it still has this natural
luster in it um I actually didn't put
nothing in the hair when I flat ironed
it I just used some holding spray which
is you know my Garnier Fructis that just
works like magic and um yeah it's been
holding up great so if you guys are
interested make sure you guys go to
glamour angels hair to look I think this
I did a review on this head while I did
a review on this hair and then I did an
update on this real hair when it was
straight but people were asking me can t
be curled and as you can see oh yeah it
holds the curl and I went to Disneyland
with this hair and my hair was still
curled at the end of the day it just
wasn't asked this curl it it kind of had
more of a looser wave but I knew that
was gonna happen so what I did was I cut
my hair real tight the night before cuz
I did this way I redid the entire wig
because remember initially I had a side
part um I would put it right here this
is what the hair look like originally
and it was just really long and a really
straight and you guys know I love my
hair that's just like my signature but I
was like I do want to try something else
and I do want to go for another look
because I love the way that that other
hair came out and I'm gonna do that
again so the night before we was going
to Disneyland I found my wig
we did the entire thing and I've been I
didn't finish until like 3:00 in the
morning
then I had to get up at 8:00 so we could
get up and go to Disneyland so I was
really tired but hair turned out great
you guys follow me on Instagram which
should be somewhere it should be over
here I think um then you guys would have
seen the videos that I posted and all of
that good stuff
oh I do have a Disneyland pass so people
are asking me am I ever gonna like do a
vlog or a blog about that so next time
we go I just didn't want to do it for my
birthday because I just want to have fun
and I don't have to worry about actually
recording so yeah but as you can see
there's no snags there's nothing and
this is an O so it will help if y'all
knew what Lentz in all that good stuff
so I have in 534 inches so we have 5 34
inches
um popping off here and then of course
like I told you I had to go ahead and I
had to cut it because it was thin at the
bottom after I put all the layers in the
front and I'm thinking about doing this
style because everybody on Instagram and
Momma is asking me can you do a tutorial
on how you got to curls this way and the
cut that you did on this so I think I'm
gonna do this but I think I'm gonna do
it on a wig like I made this week cuz
clearly it's left it here and a closure
but I think I'm gonna do it like on a
lace wig um just to kind of give you
guys an idea of how easy this is because
it's actually very simple
um to cut your hair like this you don't
have to be a cuttest a genius to uh get
your hair like this you just have to be
uh just a little scissor savvy so I
think I'm gonna do that but yeah my
closure is a 14 I think it's between a
14 and 16 so about 15 so somewhere in
between there and what I do is I just
use my closure as a guideline as to
where I want my layers to go because
we're usually wherever the closure falls
is where my chin would stop or just a
little bit shoulder so this I was longer
than this I but now this side is longer
then this I it so I got to recut this so
I can match this so I could stop doing
that but other than that um hair is a
man it's been months when I tell you my
I did the entire season of Love &amp;amp; Hip
Hop then some I'm a trained and I had
this hair in um what else I put a darker
rent on it took that beautifully so yeah
glamour angels hair always I just I love
their hair and I love so the subways
closures from closure story you just
cannot go wrong with those closures like
they're so perfect so yeah um I'll catch
you guys in my next one I hope you guys
enjoyed this and I have a lot of more
updates coming up um so I think you know
all right I'll catch y'all in the next
one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
