there is a here in Venice there is a
beauty supply that is using all of my
 videos for their promotional use
but nobody's asked me I've received a
check and you know YouTube videos are
made for personal use they are not made
for consumption of a company of any sort
unless you give them me okay otherwise
they are pretty much using your image
and everything else without your
permission so we're going to go roll up
on them and see what they say about that
thing because I got photos and video
proof so they really can't deny so this
is a photo of my video plane in the
actual beauty supply and here's the
video
hello question my friend was here and he
said that he's seen my videos plans up
here
so do you know who's in charge of the
projection of these my friend was here
and he told me that he's doing a video
playing do you yes here yes he's gonna
see my video explaining and I wanted to
know who's in charge of this okay like
someone is like I'm nothing - maybe
okay so apparently Jimmy is the one who
does this and made on she doesn't know
anything she definitely is she's
clueless about that situation and again
you know like I said if you ask me
probably all what I just told you yes
but the fact is you're using it as
promotional material nothing I've never
been to this beautys to put like wow
Beauty Supply this is the grand opening
for and I don't want anybody to get the
impression that I come here that I'm
doing that I don't see anything wrong
with the place but it gives the wrong
impression you can't say I don't get any
in my hair from here I've never worked
with these two before and people have to
understand your brand is all you got so
you can't just let people slap their
name and use material that is not for
them you can't do that and a lot of
times this happens to us especially when
you're you know promoting companies or
whatever the situation is you can't use
any moments here and say here's a
tutorial because it's free technically
an aspirant because it's on a free
platform but you know you're using it as
promotional material for your company
that's like if I took a Wendy's cup and
I'm starting to now tell people I sell
these Wendy's cups it may not look just
like this but I got something similar to
it you should buy from me that's kind of
how it comes off so she she doesn't
remember anything her bangs are really
nice but she doesn't she doesn't know
anything and again this wasn't me to be
a bitch it's just for me to protect
myself and somebody let me know because
otherwise I would never know I don't
never come over here like ever so yeah I
just wanted to kind of let you guys know
if you put anything on the internet and
you don't have and somebody is using
your material you have the right to tell
them to not use it and if it's used
again and you can get definitely press
charges criminal charges of them using
your stuff without your permission
you're I'm saying it's one thing when
you're using it and you just like a
photo and you post it that's great but
to me we're saying here is that I've
shop here this person's hair comes from
here what I'm on YouTube or not they're
going to try to sell you some hair
that's everything in here is in a pack
and it in the rocket pack hair because I
used to track here too
and I wrong with it but they're going to
try to push their products on you and
that's not what I was promoting I didn't
have any type of you know prior
knowledge about this company whatsoever
so
again like I said just be careful people
here they'll slap your name on anything
I've seen my face plastered on
them bonnets and also Beyonce - and you
have to glide you can't do that you know
I'm saying if you don't get any
compensation for those videos being
played and you know she said it's a DVD
so it's not even like they're playing it
from my channel where they at least are
monetized and I'm getting something no
use ripped it off of you to put it on a
DVD sent it to a company now they're
playing it in their place of business
we're not doing that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
