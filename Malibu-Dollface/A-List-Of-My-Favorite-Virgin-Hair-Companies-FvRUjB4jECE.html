something a little bit different because
I get this axe this question all the
time and this request for a video so I'm
do requests um what are my top five
favorite virgin hair companies so I know
a lot of you guys always ask me like who
has the best is who has the best is and
often I get this question but the thing
is and I think the reason want to get a
little frustrating a little attitude is
because sometimes people like who has
the best hair and sometimes you guys
have to understand ask the proper
question to get the proper answer
everybody's every company is different
everybody every company has their strong
suits and then they have they you know
so we're going to do that who has the
best what so this is no particular order
so don't think I like one better than
the other one but these are my top five
these are not Aliexpress companies these
are like US based companies that I have
definitely work with so I'm gonna start
off with magic hair company because
that's the care that I'm currently
wearing right now in the review for this
should actually be up already
um magic hair company is responsible for
some of my best looks and I know for a
fact that the owner always makes sure
that she has something fresh and new she
measured only was the first company I'd
used a not a closure but I used a you
part from measure company is the first
company I got some of my favorite wavy
hair from y'all that's through kitchen
um they also I've got some of my best
wigs from them because you guys remember
wanna have the big it was like big and
blue and I still have that way to this
day I just haven't had a chance to put
it back home but it was like this aqua I
used like indigo blue and aquamarine and
I did this nice big natural blue Bush
very a lot police and I got it from them
so I love magic hair company that is
some of the best hair that I've ever had
and to this day is still some of the
hair that I still use you know so the
next company that I really like is her
hair company her company is responsible
for bumble for my veins and you guys
know I'm not BIGBANG we're at all
I'm not really in the mains but because
the hair was so beautiful it was so
sleek it was easy to click and it laid
properly I was able to get this look
like I wanted to because again my
closure was not from them but my um my
hair was from them but it blended
seamlessly and sometimes depending on
the origin of your hair it don't blend
it no matter how straight it is
sometimes you can tell the difference if
you I'm just lookin real hard ever hair
so sometimes I feel like you could tell
that the texture is off her company also
gives me great day bundles are nice
their bundles are full and you guys know
I don't like super long West and I don't
like short West either but I noticed
that with them when I do get my straight
hair it is a nice them even if it's long
it's still a lot of hair and a lot of
time you know you know they say the
longer I mean the longer the hair the
shorter the bundle the shorter the hair
longer the bundle but it seems I think
even there is out which I really do like
and when you're buying hair that's one
of the most important things like how
much hair am I going to get impart but
each bundle because both people's
bundles are like three ounces and that's
cool but if a company but to really just
you know do you have some nice I
definitely and they have their hair
takes color very well too I did uh like
I think it was jet black note was blue
black and it I redid that here which I
haven't worried yet but I redid it and
actually came out blue black it was a
color that I was using that just didn't
work when I first reviewed it but and
then y'all know I got my my curly knock
over my heart earlier with my wavy hair
that that's like my everyday wig okay
I'm telling you I just be like I like
when it's fresh and it's fluffy and I
can just throw it over mm-hmm
the next company that I really like is a
virgin hair obsession and again they're
another company who offers color and
again color is something that is
everybody's not well versed in color you
know a lot of times I'm gonna save the
company's name but just because not
about them but some way companies that I
work with I'll complain to you guys that
they're black hair is nice but they're
colored hair always comes to me dry and
that's because whoever's doing it it's
not treating the hair right and you can
tell when you put it in you know but
their hair I had it read with them it
was like a chariot and I think I did it
like this as well why everything I like
had a middle part here I think I had it
like this as well and it came with a
match enclosure and it was it still to
this day is that nice super duper Tamale
read it didn't turn orange when I washed
it it didn't bleed when I washed it so
they did a great job and they offer like
ombre colors what it's like black blonde
green or it's like a pink a dark pink
and then a lighter pink like if you're
really in ticket into the candy colors a
virgin hair assumption to me would be
the best place to go they offer
beautiful color but they also offer
closures to match any exact color
because a lot of times as I said it with
this particular hair I had to go back
and get the color but sometimes people
are not like I said well-versed in
coloring so you really don't want to do
it this oil so if you go by some ratchet
red hair with a ratchet red um you know
closer to match and it's perfect you'll
have to do nothing but get it put in or
put it in yourself or if you can find
some blue hair some orange hair like
whatever if they have it that's the best
thing because again when you paying all
this money for hair the last thing you
want to do is have to make it exactly
what you want you know it's besides
having to put it in you want it to look
nice on the next company that I really
really like is glam angels and glamour
angels was the first company that I
really like learned how to like lay my
closure to match my wig like perfectly
and it didn't look like a wig and you
guys know I started off doing wigs and
then I went into the wefted hair and
then learn how to construct my own wig
so I kind of I've learned with you guys
you know I've learned not learned I've
learned with you guys you know in 2016
I'm working on my vocabulary or whatever
so yeah I definitely have been a loving
glam
I haven't worked with him in a while
again no specific reason but I just
haven't but I think my 34 inch hair was
it so long as hair I've ever done I have
some right now from a different company
but my 34 inch hair was definitely some
hair that I was obsessed with then I cut
it and then I cut it into again this
style which but it was black and to the
day that hair still is popping and I
think I had like five bundles in it and
I had a closure from closure store and
even though closure store is not
necessarily a hair company that's one of
my favorite places to get my closures
from because they last so long and uh
there's some bases match my my scalp
just like perfectly you guys know this
is the lace but I have right now but
lovely little base closure the next
company that I really like which I know
I'm going past five now is our glam hair
our glam is they have some beautiful
hair okay like I'll be seeing on their
Instagram like during them like our
young I am I love something and then
eyewear for a minute then take it off so
I'll be like I'm six to kind of what I
know but I really do love their hair and
a lot of my subscribers a lot of you
guys who have seen my reviews that I
brought the hair would be like y'all was
a year later and I'm still rocking still
pushing so when your hair last that long
is always a great thing they have great
customer service um and that's really
great for a company when you have a
company who really takes pride in to
speak into the consumer about what
they're buying and how to understand
what they're buying because sometimes
when you just stick a pamphlet in the
damn package people don't read it does
people want to put the hair in they give
a damn about what you talking about but
if somebody has a issue with their hair
you can call them and be like yo my hair
kind of had it up on me what could I do
like did I do something wrong come like
this was a bad batch like what happened
and they're always trying to fix
whatever the issue is and the companies
all of the money that I have named how
you're able to do that email them
contact them if you ever get hair and
you don't like it or something wrong
with
you know you didn't do it counting the
company and tell them yo something that
will my hair is not acting right and try
to let them rectify the situation to fix
it the next company that I like is
diamond a virgin hair and I'm emerging
here is responsible for my good old
viral video that's been on a shade room
a few times
it was my mink hair and I haven't um I
haven't had my mink hair for a minute
because I ended up giving it to someone
because they really wanted that hair and
they were obsessed with it and I was
like alright long take it was my my
friends and she just kept talking about
it and I mean anything and I was like on
so she's like can I please have this
week and I please have the song give it
to her just take it like she was so like
she and she wears it just like mines and
I'm gonna say your name but you know who
you is oh but I love that hair
it was so straight like it was so but it
was straight and light but it was thick
and it moves I can't you know y'all know
I like my hair to move it moved and he
just grooved in you know it just so yeah
I'm a virgin hair and the ending of my
coming here what I did with them I like
that I like my curly hair a lot I didn't
love it and the reason why I didn't love
it because there was a lot of
maintenance and when it comes to wavy or
curly hair if it's a lot of maintenance
I tend not to wear it a lot um so you
know it happens the last company don't
going to mention is virgin hair fix and
virgin hair fix is a hair company that I
love because I can wear the curly hair
with no maintenance
you guys know where this hair this
particular company with Myra James hit
why called Myra James but it's the big
curly Bush that I love to wear that
recently seven Streeter had and a lot of
people were hitting me up I was like I
thought this was you because y'all are
smart that's one of my goals you know
because I don't have to leave no leave
out I can literally put it on one you
judge it up and leave and all I have to
do is give it a nice little bath with
some my I could use like on whatever
shampoo one
here and then put some good likely
Fincham um conditioner let it dry upside
down after I rinse it out and it's good
to go follow back on out the dough so
virgin Airfix is one of my favorites and
again their customer service is really
good as well I remember I had inquired
about something I don't know what it was
and I got a prompt response you know and
this wasn't because I was one of the
reviewers because one of my subscribers
had the same question and they asked
before I did
got a prompt response so um those are my
favorite um I don't know how many that
was it was supposed to be five and it's
showing it went past five but those are
some of my favorite hair companies not
all of them but those are the ones that
come to mind right now and I'm thinking
like based off looks that I've had who
did that who didn't do that so um if you
guys like this make sure you guys put
that you liked it below like you know I
really appreciate I did and I'm doing
for Alex price to like some of my
favorite Aliexpress brands because I
didn't I tend to review for them a lot
more and um I've had some good looks
from there too which I never in my life
thought I would have but hey all things
have a forward reason so my hair is
falling I'm gonna catch all of my NYX
