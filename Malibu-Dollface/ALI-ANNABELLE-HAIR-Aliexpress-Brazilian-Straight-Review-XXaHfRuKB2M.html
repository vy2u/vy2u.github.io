no you couldn't possibly
she noted something different about no
makeup because it's very like it's very
natural today okay I'm going to get
crazy with my eyeliner but can you guys
tell something different about my hair
other than effect I'm using to worry I
have on a closure I have no more closure
and I don't know how damn long and I
sure can tell just by my install
different but it just feels so different
than it does with a frontal completely
so this hair is from Annabelle here and
you guys know Annabelle hair is one of
those places that I have some of my most
watched videos from which was my
straight hair that I different him that
so you guys I no longer have that here
that here is actually with my friend
xiaomi now he just worked to Coachella
with no issues so she's still kicking
and it's been over a year so I am
wearing a brazilian straight and this is
four bundles but it yes four bundle
because if I woulda cut this with three
bundles my hair wasn't much thinner than
this and then my frontal I mean see my
closure I believe is 18 inches so what I
did was I went ahead and cut some layers
into it and you know this is a very easy
look and then I went ahead and curled it
as you can see because I wanted to just
give it some life and give it some body
and then I went ahead and taped it down
right here but man it feels weird not to
have no frontal on like where I can show
you all my edges and throw this in it
mm-hmm we're not getting that I don't
know how they've got lost in translation
where I said yes to a closure does that
usually I always like no even if it's
only a 13 by 4 and I'm on the favorite
or thirsty my stick
I usually say I'll take that over a
closure but I know some of you guys
actually feel like closures and that's
fine too the hair itself first off I
will say that I do like to tear a whole
lot this is very reminiscent of what I
had once before I believe I actually
have
they're wonderful for from them and it
what has not given me any issues
whatsoever I also leave my glasses below
because I'm feeling very old Hollywood
right now and today I actually had lunch
today
not with this water on because it is too
much but I did this whole look where I
just wore like some very natural makeup
not nothing too crazy and I wanted to
just you know accompany with a little
bit of glasses you know just a little
bit diva like act to what so as far as
the closure goes the course is fine as
you can see this is what our god this is
the you know it doesn't closes on give
you as much versatility as you would get
with a frontal or a full lace wig but if
it is a job and it cut easy didn't give
me no issues we're trying to cut this so
as far as the hair goes as you can see
it's very soft when I run the brush
through it doesn't give me any issues
there's no snagging there's no issues
there is no shedding mainly and yeah I
feel like a hippie Loki
yeah so you see it's still soft it's
still bouncy it still has life to it
it's not dead or anything like that I
only cut so much oh I couldn't went in
and really chopped it up but I couldn't
do that just because I wanted you guys
to actually see how this hair fair I've
had it for quite some time I don't
remember the timeline of how long I've
had this here but it's been definitely a
minute the only downside about this hair
that I don't like is the fact that and
the frontal to it but it's straighter
it's not nothing that's going to be an
issue our problem I did however keep
these curls up in here for over a week
because I was supposed to update this
while supposed to do this review last
week and I didn't get around to it so
once I took the lid off then and hedges
I just been like literally plopping it
on and I've been just as a hat week now
you know when you don't have a frontal
you wear this with a cute little hat so
hold on
so this is usually how I would wear this
on a normal day and this is how I
usually wear it I don't usually not wear
that's why my top of my head kinda looks
like I'm here because this is how I'm
usually wearing it and it was great it's
very comfortable I usually wear this
with like some cute shorts and then you
know have a good little you know hippie
is type of feel to this but overall the
hair doesn't give me any major tangling
I just have to make sure that I again
washed it with the correction who I use
hold on okay so I begin a lot of
questions and I will do an update video
on this later
but if the product that I like to use
for certain types of hair I like to use
this shampoo and conditioner from at the
Kerr company as you can see this one is
almost gone but I like to use these
because they actually work and there may
I don't know if they're made
specifically for extensions however they
were great on extensions they were
growing my hair - but I'm noting a big
difference in how my hair acts after
using these these are both made of has
no parabens it is a straightener safe
okay I don't think you guys understand
what that means but keratin also is
another thing that is great because it
actually helps the hair stay you know
fortified and nice and bouncy and
beautiful so I like to use these on my
curly wavy and all in my hair - all my
extensions in my hair I like to use this
those are available on Medicare company
site but I also still use these which is
my Giovanni's RTR the Tea Tree shampoo I
like to use it now a word of advice
these are great for clarifying okay and
there is a meeting a meeting there's a
meter on the back here that tells you
how much clarifying versus how much
moisturizing and hydrating you're going
to get from this so make sure when you
buy these again these are normally $24
you can get them as your local t.j.maxx
$4.99 so these are great so I use these
to do the initial wash when I first get
my hair and then
like to use this this is the magic stuff
this is the smooth as silk deep moisture
shampoo now this stuff is what keeps my
extensions looking nice and luxurious
like such after I go ahead for a wash so
that my hair because I think what people
think is when your hair squeaky that is
clean and that's true but it also needs
to be moisturized and clean as well
because if it doesn't then you're going
to get a lot of static in your hair your
hair is not going to be bouncy like this
and not going to want to stay and that
ain't nothing cute any hot so this is
actually the key of what I like to use
and this is a smooth as silk by
giovanni's this is not sponsored I paid
with these as you can see by this
t.j.maxx logo with my own money
as far as cutting not a problem holding
a curl great shedding like I said I get
a strand here and there I don't get no
major clumps and you guys know we're
straight here that's usually a big issue
is that you get a lot of clumps of hair
and you know while you're wearing it if
you're brushing and combing I always
have a brush or comb on me just to make
sure and when I have layers like this
you know you always want to kind of keep
it out of your face to kind of define
your layers but no I haven't had no
major issues but I don't have issues
with their hair like they're like I
don't really have issues at all with
Annabelle hair it's usually completely
fine I don't have no problems and lasts
me I seem like a century in a lifetime
and yeah so if you guys are interested
in this hair again I will put the links
to this hair below and you guys are
interested in the styling video for this
although I've done one a while ago I
have not yet done one in like Super HD
since I've changed everything so if
you're looking for a video for something
simple like this and like so the ins and
outs of cutting your extension that you
have like this put it below because I
think it will help a lot of people
because usually when I do this and I did
this with a 5-part a lot of people's
like can you put a video on how you
curls it so I think it is just so let me
know if you guys are interested in that
and yeah I will catch y'all in my next
one
