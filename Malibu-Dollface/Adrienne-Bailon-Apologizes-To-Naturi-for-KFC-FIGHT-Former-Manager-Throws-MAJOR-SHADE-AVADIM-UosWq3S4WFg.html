you guys are used to cuz I'm a closet
now and as you can see I am not done I'm
almost done though I'm almost done this
chair that I'm in is still wrapped up
cuz I don't want to scratch it but that
ain't why I'm here I'm here because I
would like to talk about the fact that
Adrienne publicly apologized to Natori
for the KFC assault that happened to her
back in 2002 with promises so what we're
gonna do is okay so if you guys are not
aware who 3rw is throughout of you is
was a group of our girl of all girl
group that held out of New York and it
was Keeley Williams Adrienne Bailon and
Ituri Naughton and they had everybody's
favorite no more and I do they had some
hits on their hands and then in 2002 the
group broke up and whoa the group didn't
break up the tree was kicked out of the
group okay
and they she said that she was kicked
out the group because she was a
dark-skinned girl they said she was
kicked out of the group because of the
fact that she was no longer happy with
the management which happens to be
Keeley's sister /on or mom oh it's a
worse situation but um and then they say
that they had told her that she should
have slept with one of the members of
the st. lunatics in order for through
Adobe to secure a spot on the tour now
this goes back because I was this is the
era of my music where I was real deep
into it and I remember seeing throwing w
for the first time on on the box
Cory I know the box right and I was like
you know these girls seem like I
remember Keeley had a green ponytail
girl but they have like these like box
 box talk and Keeley was like you
know we're the new how girls how you
guys check us out
I love I do I remember was
as a fan of theirs where I remember I
had a dream that album came out and they
hadn't remember least yet but I do
remember getting to bring it on
soundtrack for two reasons one cuz I had
brought my granny had the Bach monitors
kalium album and I couldn't get it
without an adult so I just kind of stuff
that out him in there so they loved it
seemed like it was just cherlene in you
know look him and then also because they
had a song on it because their arm had
came out yet called till I say so which
is still my jam that wrap that Kili did
was so profound it was on gnosis level
so I I was excited you know about their
album to come out came out I remember
recording everything that they were when
I remember them being Owen um means he
live that's where Keeley made the
mistake saying that a her and Bow Wow or
when she said I was her boo-boo Bell
well that's what she said then bow on
decided to come back like take you home
and say girls and groups and we'd go
with each other
and I was like oh girl he just played
you to the left so for years I've always
wondered why Adrian and Keeley aren't
friends anymore she's made that very
abundant on a real she's like and I had
this crew member whenever we're no
longer friends she said that a few times
and because after the situation that
happened with her e-ever she went on
Wendy Williams radio show at the time
and explained everything and how she
pretty much was in the face with a
two-piece from KFC now the situation was
this is what I had heard okay and I
remembered it was on 106 &amp;amp; Park talking
about it they said that they were in a
car they heard the tree on the phone
saying that the two life game girls were
kissing kicking me out of the group and
based on the lawsuit that that was found
by the jury and her people back in 2002
pretty much she was kicked out of the
room because she just she failed to seal
the deal with the st. lunatics as far as
sleeping with them to secure that spot
so she was forced out of the group
now throughout w was a group that was
about diverse young ladies so I was kind
of confused as why would you pretty much
kick somebody that adds a
the group that the other girl other two
girls do not add so that happened
everything blew over then I remember
seeing a tree in Fame and then after she
did Fame she did I think like lottery
ticket I'm going like big things that
she did and then after a lottery ticket
it was kind of she did what was the show
I was a Hugh Hefner show about the girls
were bunny she did that show and then
she ended up on power so when she ended
up on power I was like okay mama is kind
of putting you know music on a back
burner but she still you know she's
still doing her thing and at that
particular time she had made such a name
for herself to the point where people
forgot that she was even in thrill w
Saul and then through W at this point
have you came to LW and then to iw
became a Cheetah Girls so I remember
seeing her would you not see in the sory
I seen her somewhere and spoke to her
bravery it was like brief but I was like
I loved you in notorious and I know Kim
hates notorious but I think for what she
was given she did a great job and she
was I think you I appreciate that you
know dealing with a lot of the back and
forth you know so I appreciate that so
cut to now you know Adrian and Keeley
are no longer friends and Natori is
known the real now I remember when they
were asking the story like have you and
Adrian spoke and she was like not really
but you know if I have to go on the road
to promote of course I will do so
because that's my job so it cuts to now
where she publicly apologized and said
I'm very sorry for what it transpired
when we were kids and you know I never
did anything to hurt you now this
situation reminds me a lot of the
Destiny's Child situation and this
situation didn't work like the Destiny's
Child situation I thought that I feel
like through a double use management
thought we gonna do the same thing that
Destiny's Child is over there doing if
the low bitch don't wanna do we want her
to do we don't kick her ass out the
group is gonna replace her with some
more girls and ain't nobody gonna notice
because she's the meat of the group
well she's not she's not the meat of the
group so I remember them saying you know
she saying I got hit with a two-piece in
that whole thing
so the gold the story goes they were in
the car she was like she told the board
moderator on their website at the time
this is when before Twitter and
Instagram and all that that she was
being forced out of the group by the two
light-skinned girls and they hurt her so
they went to KFC they were in a van
they went to KFC and she confronted her
she will Adrienne confronted natori
about it and Kili was getting her food
so they were not in the drive to they
were actually parked and with Cuba came
back Adrian and Natori were having words
it got heated and the wet Adrian and
Kili said was that um Keeley's little
sister Tia was in the seat and they said
you know how little kids are when they
see adults or older people screaming
they want to get in the conversation too
and she went like this and she hit
Keeley's plague so I'm assuming that
Kili decided in the midst of this
argument let me eat my food while we
arguing III personally couldn't do it
but hey it's what it is right
so thank says she's you know at this
point it ended up being on the story now
I was like that sounds plausible but I
just don't feel like that judging
judging
I don't know Keeley I don't know her but
judging by all the that she was in
there was a Bigfoot baobab and it was a
beef with b2k and then it's just seemed
like every time there was something with
300w Keeley would be the corporate of it
I believe we are a year apart so Keeley
was during this time I think she was 16
so we I was about 15 16 at this time too
and she was very talkative and she was
she had a lot of energy but she always
seemed like she was in something now in
2007 I want to say we listen to Beauty
Awards and I believe this is the year
that Beyonce had did deja vu and like
shut the down so we were there and
we hadn't went in yet and they were
outside doing the carpet and this time
Jay was in the group who replaced Natori
and I'm like okay throw it up he's there
I haven't seen him in a while they're
still together this is before the
Cheetah Girls I believe had even kicked
off so they were still in the midst of
doing that album that never came out and
I was like can I get a you know a photo
which also does she so Adrienne was like
yeah
so she ended her conversation are called
Nicole cuz Nicole was the one with all
the digital cameras at the time and I
asked for a photo she was gracious she
was nice and then we were kind of like
you know we want a photo with the roof
so Jay comes over and I'm like ha she's
definitely giving me high like that very
fake ass high so again I'm like her I
don't even know you like you were your
replacement okay replacement so we're
not gonna do that and then she was like
Kili sunset pictures and then I'm under
Kimmy's breath she was like
bitch and then it was like this very
faint thing
Adrian was genuinely nice the other two
not so much that's the only encounter
that I had ever had with Kili but I know
a lot of other people who know her and
they said she definitely was a she was a
sixteen year old 17 year old girl with a
lot of attitude so you know again it was
and when spectacular came out mushy I
did the whole thing I didn't really see
a issue with it I quite frankly liked it
right now she's managing a group with
one of my friends is in called
billion-dollar baby so she's still
working she's still doing she's doing
but I just felt like a lot of the drama
that would happen between them are in
reference to them will always have her
in the center and then Adrian will be
pulled into it so I was like it's a
matter of time where they're not gonna
be friends anymore and of course ended
up being a situation where they were no
longer cool so it's like you went from
being in front of you with her then you
were in the Cheetah Girls with her you
guys did all these tours and then you
guys are not friends after spending all
that time together I felt like it was
that because Keeley's parental figure I
don't know if it was just on to whoever
was the person that was in charge then
Adrian had to go along with it like an
attorney I feel bad about this but at
the same time I have to roll my crew
member because this is where my money is
coming in at you know I have to help my
mom I can't fail at this so I have to go
where the money is and this is bad and I
felt like this is the same situation
because that's pretty much for the time
being let's what you said about beyoncé
and Kelly like that's her dad her she's
gonna go in his direction no matter what
the situation is so we've been friends
since we was kids we weren't right now
you trying to push my daddy out of his
men managerial position and that's not
going
work so again you become the mean person
you become the corporate you become the
person that everybody starts to hate
after a while so I think in this moment
with Adriene being married in Detroit
being pregnant and them both being in a
good place she could say she says years
ago that they had had a conversation and
she told her she was sorry she didn't
mean to try to hurt her in any way and I
think that was big of her to do it in
that moment but it was also big her to
do it in public just because of the fact
that I feel like for years people just
was like you know girl who was there
helping Oh chick throw the chicken at
her and it was really up and it
just was like the two light-skinned
girls against the dark-skinned girl so I
felt like that was a real good moment
but natori definitely looked like she
was not ready because when she said that
she was just kind of like bitch are you
really
right now we're gonna do this right okay
all right girl so you know I'm sure you
know Kiwis marry now and she seems to be
doing big and great things do I ever
think there would be a thrill w reunion
probably not I don't think I think like
we'll get a Pussycat Dolls Ryu and you
will get a Destiny's Child original
member rien Beyonce Kelly Lata Felix Way
and Michelle went on tour bitch I would
be there I would dress like a B at that
 concert bitch because I
will be there
 flying but I feel like oh this is
kind of the age-old story of grow groups
like everybody 702 SWV oh dream all of
these do you know you have members in
and out management and from what I know
in this situation though it was more
sort of a manager adult situation than
it is with the girls so you know the
Cheetah Girls came right at the tail end
of the thrill w literally about to crash
and burn like legit because I remember
they did a song and this Lady of soul
Awards how I remember but J was in the
broom
Adrian was killing it and I remember
being at that Lady of soul Awards I was
a seat-filler girl I had to get in there
somehow I had it money and I remember
them getting up to go performing kili
just got a booty out just like I was
just like why is she so extra like but
again she was 17 I always a mess - 17 -
I
checking on people at 17 but I was a
mess so you know it was I'm happy to see
them come to a close and this be a
situation and because this is a group
that I loved growing up I'm happy to see
that at least two out of three ain't bad
that could come together and say I'm
sorry and even when Kelly was doing like
act Keely on her website I was a fan
like I said I like spectacular a lot of
people did I did you know and I think
because she comes from a family of
people who are business minded her mom
and her on we've done a lot of stuff
with people in the industry I think this
is a good position for her I don't think
she no longer wants to be part of the
industry as an artist but more so as a
behind the things person I think she
kind of got that out of her system
possibly I don't know but I'm happy to
see that these two women could come
together as women and say I'm sorry that
I hurt you I'm sorry
so forgiveness is looking pretty good in
2017 and hopefully when Beyonce decides
to drop those twins which I believe she
already did and they just putting up old
pictures of her cuz her mama kind of
spilled the beans but I think they just
trying to draw it out a little bit more
because that's the best that's what that
does Jedi mind-trick girl but um yeah
I'm happy to see I wanted to share this
with y'all cuz again no now if it's okay
I can get together and do some like
this girl I might have to go get my old
chunks and my forget Omari I'm one piece
go get my braids foot back in and act
the up because I will be front and
 center for that beads okay is
hot reunion Tori you better I will blog
every moment so let me know how
you guys feel about this if you guys
were three on WFAN and how do you feel
about what transpired on a real keep you
put your comments below and let me know
okay I'll get your honest
Hey okay guys I'm not exactly finished
cuz I just got some empty
so he's Williams who is was threat abuse
manager she said the following I'll put
the screenshot down here what what
exactly did we do to Naturi Naughton
what is she apologizing for we put you
on a youth thing here talking trash
about us then she said too bad at
glamour underscore ped which I believe
is Keeley's Twitter I don't remember
I didn't look it up I won't dignify your
lies by responding it's uh if it would
mean I start dropping the truth bombs
you don't want to get her started okay I
think you should fight fire with fire
especially when people have been talking
smack for years to face what lie should
I suppose first okay so that's what she
said
girl I got my voice here on YouTube let
me know what's really going on now well
I'll wait for the other one to come up
okay
so then it says so let me get this
straight
Adrienne and Adrienne blunt by Lockett
seems to be managed by me for four years
after the three nothing left for W
because she was afraid please and yes
after thirteen years of listening to
tall tales especially at Naturi Naughton
I'm pissed off you had a problem with
your skin color not us so I feel like
everything that Natori said and
everything the Adrienne said as far as
it being a adult situation she's proving
this to be completely and utterly true
because why would you go off on a tirade
like this none of this was true then you
would get legally involved and say hey
you were slandering me I'm gonna sue you
for slander and we're gonna go that way
about it but to get on Twitter and have
a thirteen year old Twitter attack about
it it doesn't work we start talking
about sleeping with married men for
years behind everyone's back you know
why the Cheetah Girls ended naked
pictures of Adrienne Bailon
and Disney wasn't having any of that now
from my understanding
I don't know the timeline it is but I'm
doing cheetah wrestling over when those
pictures had end up getting late I don't
know
Rob Kardashian never saw it coming she
schemed on him in and shoot him up and
spit him out and I'm not talking about
blac Chyna know at what point but she
know anything about going on with
Adrienne if y'all wasn't even cool
during that time is that I don't even
know what that means funny thing is that
killing us we're actually closer to
Adrienne and Ituri and then somebody
acts natori on Twitter did they ever
apologize to her as she put yes Adrienne
did so I feel like teeth only added fuel
to the fire of the situation and made it
worse
so again put your thoughts below how you
guys feel about this I feel like it's a
crock of and I feel like she just
really proved I was trying to give them
a benefit is it out but she just proved
what they were saying
y'all some bullies some grown-ass
bullies</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
