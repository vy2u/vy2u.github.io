I do with like my side part because
bangs always I feel more mysterious to
me bangs are like sunglasses you can't
really see all of me you can kind of get
some of me but you can't see all of me
that's what I feel in there all of these
layers honey oh yes girl
oh yes winds so this hair that I'm
wearing is from Ali Greece and you guys
know about uh grace before and I've done
these bangs before however when I did it
my hair was much longer when I did it
it's not the route to like my but it was
pretty long um so I decided to do a
tutorial cuz I got a lot of questions
about that I can you give us a tutorial
how to cut bangs so I gave you guys a
very simple to the point tutorial on how
to cut bangs without jacking them up if
this is your first time I'm doing them
so they can end up real nice and fluffy
and even like this because I know a lot
of people have done reviews on bangs and
then a lot of times when I see people
cut them they look weird afterwards
now this cut that I did isn't exactly
the same cut of the other one the other
one um it was more of a China bang I
didn't have any layers like this all it
is going on on this side it was more so
straight I put a little bit at the
bottom just cuz I don't my hair to seem
so flat how long didn't have nearly as
much as this one does this one has a lot
of layers so in that video I cover
layers what you can do if you want to
cuz I did a video like on couldn't let a
very simple layers years ago but that
video is kind of outdated cuz I don't
really do it like that anymore it's
similar but not the same but if you want
you can just skip the bang part and go
to the layers part because I know that
you a lot of guys ask me of our layers
and my
previous video and neither more like on
the choppier side if I was a little more
uh like a 90s that would have been much
more feathery and much more shorter so
like I said this hair is from Ali grace
this is Brazilian straight it's in three
bundles one of the q yah I feel real bar
I to throw my mosquito Barbie stuff
because I feel so Barbie like you know
and I had to put the blue in the back
because I let me some cans so um yeah I
really do like this look I this you know
the thing about bangs is the bangs
low-key leather helmet it just hides
what you don't want to see although I do
have I do have my eyebrows done up
underneath here like lycra and I'm
really sad that I did that much workers
you're not gonna be able to see them at
all I can't say that I do really enjoyed
this and the reason I enjoyed this is
because sometimes I don't feel like
doing I don't want to go my weight down
I don't want to tape it down I don't
want to put a band in it sometimes I
just don't want you to see my forehead
it just depends you know so I went ahead
and cut them as you guys will see in a
video a lot of people have issues with
cutting neck i'ma tell y'all cut as
little I started my bangs all the way
down here if you guys can go and
actually watch this tutorial now cuz
actually up I started him here and then
I just cut them up and because there's
kind of a art that goes right here um I
usually cut up into the bangs and then I
cut this way and then this way
as opposed to cut them straight across
you can have some china bangs if you
wanted to you know some Chinese bangs is
cool but if you're not going for that
look I wanted more of like the mushroom
look you guys know a while ago I did
like a very marriage a blush look and it
was like this short so don't look at
that it was like this short but it came
all the way around that's kind of the
look I was going for with all of the
layers that are have been here because I
wanted something that had a little bit
more texture to it and you'll see in the
tutorial that I pull some of the hair
from here we go ahead and cut but you
don't want to cut too much in the back
but you could you know if you look into
90s a lot of girls hair looked like this
a lot of Chinese Wilson is another
were a lot of big bangs in the early 80s
I mean in late 80s early 90s and I just
missed that look I missed that classic
70s bang I missed that classic cool bang
situation you know the dabangg with all
the layers and it just kind of just
gives you eyes and lips if I were to put
a cute little lip on like a pink I just
thought it was gonna be too much pink
okay I want to do a very neutral lip
it's a blue and pink I got a lot of
colors going on right now so I didn't
want to overdo it and kind of kill it
and I've got a strong face so I need a
strong bang now like I said you could
have cut when you watch through
tutorials you can cut it and stop and
you don't have to keep cutting into it
you can just go straight across but just
always make sure that your bangs are
very even now to the hair itself this
hair come on this let's do it let's do
it get it get it let's do it do it do it
do it it has a lot of movement to it
which I truly do appreciate it has a lot
of movement to it I did just use my
typical magic hair company character
shampoo and conditioner and I was pretty
good as far as the knots you can't see
them on this unit they were cold to
bleach they just had the stubborn
sections in the in the beginning so I
had to rebleed you twice which then
sometimes make sure you know when you
when you when you bleach your knots just
remember you're gonna make your the
knots of your frontal weaker and then
you don't want that to be your situation
at all and I opted to do bangs due to
the simple fact that everybody like I
get a lot of comments on that video and
I said why don't you ever wear bangs cuz
I look too much like my mom that's why
so I'm not a really big bang person I
did my first bangs with I think they
were great and I love them but again
bangs are something that can get very
annoying after a while because they are
in your face now as far as the hair goes
this is three bundles so this is all the
hair in the pulled forward
and this is just three bundles so it has
a very natural feel to it you know very
this is me my name is Ivanka
I have one I go to the VG okay that's
how I feel you know like I always think
of Russian women for whatever reason
when I have bangs cuz I just feel like
home to talk of the deuce
my brother who's mr. C no that's to tell
you whatever I'm working on my accents
y'all not do a mini Rihanna and she
sound a real real Spanish but whatever
um
but overall if I would give this hair
we're gonna rake the hair so the hair
itself I would give the hair nine out of
ten and the only thing that I didn't
like about the hair is the fact that it
does get poofy after a while it does not
stay super duper duper duper straight so
if you were to wear this hair on a
regular basis you would have to pull out
your flat iron because it does get puffy
I'm sure in this camera you can't tell
but let's see yeah and a camera
everything looks super duper straight
and lustrous and all that which is fine
but in actuality it does have a bit of a
poof to it but it is very nice you know
it has a lot of movement to it it is
extremely nice for me and because of
hair that I've had in the past and
understanding how in my head you know
move and shake and all that I do prefer
it to be a little bit on the straighter
side it has that that added real hair
feel to it where has that slight poof to
it were you kind of like oh good Jesus
don't let it get too hot because then
I'm gonna end up with hair that doesn't
wanna right now it's pretty cool in here
I'm good I was out today was raining
yesterday so everything is good I don't
have no problems as you can see I can
run my hands through this with no
problems that keratin shampoo and
conditioner is the best thing ever if
you can't get to that or whatever like
you guys always always tell you guys my
Tresemme works beautiful with all types
of especially aliexpress hair very like
cheaper hair it works very good for that
because it keeps all of the tangles and
all that out I can do this with no
problems okay girl no problems and you
good as far as color goes
I'm waiting I just wouldn't because and
I'm gonna tell you why cuz this hair
seems like it has what I call the orange
hue to it I did a strand test and I just
wasn't crazy about that hue that I got
and usually that hue indicates that it's
not the best thing to go ahead cuz
you're gonna have to lift it a couple of
times in order to get it a color so if
you're gonna do let's just say cuz I was
gonna put like a little streak right
here but I didn't like the way that it
looks are just left it black but if
you're gonna do like a hue or something
I just would prefer you keep this hair
like a burgundy or maybe a red but
nothing over like a four don't go over
four if you go over four you might start
to fall into some serious breakage man
and ain't good so remember all hair can
be dyed it is human but you got to
remember all the hair will not lift the
same guys hear any clicking sounds and
doctors even but yeah that's the only
thing I will say the front so I pulled
it all the way literally from the top of
it it's like a little bit of hair that's
over my truck right here and then all
this bang is actually my frontal and my
friends will is a 13-mile or frontal so
it's a typical you know whatever I would
like to add it like a ponytail back here
with the bangs and the back down that
would have been cute but I wasn't able
to do that obviously because I don't
have enough space for them and I don't
want those very PC bangs like I said I
got a strong face so I really I'm not a
big fan of how my face looks wet very
sparse
you know dainty bangs cuz I don't got a
dainty face so that's that's done mm-hmm
lipstick gonna be lucky so yeah if right
like I said if I had to give the hair I
would give it a nine and a half out of
ten because of the poofiness the frontal
was completely fine
it was involved it wasn't anything bad
or whatever so I would say it was it was
easy to blend I just have any cup thank
God I don't have no color issues you
guys that Mara told you guys I keep
having this issue where I'm getting here
from companies and I'm getting frontals
about the frontals never match my skin
tone the actual lace part
and that's kind of the issue that I'm
kind of dealing with some other
companies right now so we're gonna start
off the baby behind our hairline now cuz
I'm not about to keep doing the whole
Omarion line up girl I'm just not into
it them all I'm just not into it I'm
very like and unlike myself with bangs
if you're if you never try bangs before
try them okay and again use my tutorial
and just a side note about that Detroit
I don't think I mentioned it in there
your bangs when you cut them they will
determine on how wide you want them okay
some people like their bangs that come
out to here which I call those the 2d
bangs which I don't like I like these
better because they remind me of this
photoshoot that Britney Spears I did for
I think it was W Magazine and she was
like black and white and she was filling
it and she had like he's really PC bang
what it was a PC they was just choppy
like this and I like that like this I
just saw this all I remember was a hand
and she was all on the floor and stuff
and I was that are her bangs are bomb
and you know we remember breeding when
she first came out she had the bangs
like grade-school bang these was like
grown woman bangs do you know and this
is the thing one more thing the one
thing I do love about this is that when
you actually like cut your hair in real
life if you cut your bangs too short
they're short with a wig I could do this
and really just make them you I don't
want to see nobody or I could do this
and I could look like Beyonce demon
blood because it just depends on how you
feel you know what I'm saying so I'm not
really sure if this is the look that
you're going for but again if this is
what you want to do with yourself you
can I'm just not into this look so I
prefer them to be right here but I'm
just keeping it real with y'all so
that's the thing when you are not in the
mood let's just say you want a sexy look
you know it's like okay you want this
sexy look you gotta go out on a date and
you like yeah he cute you find yes I see
across the room you don't know what my
hairline looking like but what my
forehead hitting fall then y'all getting
a car gonna get hot and you can do this
and be like whoo yeah it's kind of hot
up in here then y'all hit that bedroom
girl and it's like this I catch you in
the morning uh-huh so yeah I hope you
guys enjoyed this I'll make sure you
