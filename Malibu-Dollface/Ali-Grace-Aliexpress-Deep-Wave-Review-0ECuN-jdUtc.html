gone for a minute in a day and a month
and we get them today hey um I have been
really lazy I got sick and I've been
working on a lot of other stuff so this
is kind of taking a backseat you know
and I'm just tryna it's a lot of great
things happening behind the scenes so
that's kind of been like you know
whatever girl so anyway this is for this
hair that I'm wearing right now it which
is from Ali grace on Aliexpress and this
is their deep wave okay now I know
you're gonna be like okay so why don't
here looks like it's curly my point
exactly
so I'm gonna back up off the chair and
I'm gonna show you guys about one basic
issue I have with this hair and this is
it and it's that my frontal is currently
and my hair is a deep wave so you see
how this is the deep wave right okay so
if you guys watch my tutorial for this
and how I define these curls and washed
in the whole thing then you would have
seen that I did saying that like the
textures don't match at all so this
doesn't really give you a true depiction
of what the deep wave looks like because
of the fact that it's curly into a deep
way and I don't know why this was done I
don't know if they did this on accident
I don't know but it definitely is two
different textures so this what happens
is when you have situations like this
happen with Church kind of forced to do
is wear it in like up styles we can't
tell are you trying to change the
texture of it or maybe let it air-dry
and pull but I don't want to do that I
just use water in my tutorial I didn't
use anything in it because I diffused it
but because this I didn't diffuse I use
this which is the magic hair company
this is the hydrating crow definer and
amplifier and I use this on my hair and
that was it and of course water and
that's pretty much all I've used in it
since I've had it I haven't put anything
so it's just been this
and water and this is the look that I've
been getting but I do like it like you
see they almost match then you get
further down and it just starts becoming
these big ringlets you know waves as
opposed to these are the maintenance
goes with this you got a lot of that was
explained in the tutorial for this
because you've seen like that was when I
first got the hair and I just first made
the wig or whatever so you kind of seen
how everything has been going but since
then if you already watch that and
you're watching this since then I've
gotten very minimal shedding which is
very surprising due to the simple fact
that I didn't cut my West and I didn't
have the gun this unit actually felled
this one so it's been a little bit
different which I was shocked by and as
far as the actual curls go
I do hi I do use the amplifier and then
I use I do when I do condition I use my
Tresemme so a lot of you guys were
asking me like how do you take care of
your curly hair or your waiver here when
you know so it can stay looking like
this as you wear it and that's the key
coach at least one to two times a week I
mean at least two to three times a week
I'm sorry and make sure that you use
good products and you can be completely
fine and your hair will look like this
probably is as long as it's gonna
actually last you I've had this hair for
months at this point it's been about
five months since I've had it's like cuz
I tutorial was done when I this was pink
originally hehe I've been through about
four colors and came back to the paint
but the company was just like not right
now run out right now or not right now
there went on vacation and the whole
thing so it's been kind of a hold up and
then it's also due to me myself as well
so yeah but I haven't had any major
issues the only my only gripe with this
hair is the fact that they gave me two
separate textures and you can obviously
tell now when I'm in public I usually
wear where I was drench it in water and
then wear it because it's easier that
way but like actually trying to run my
fingers through it and stuff I don't get
none of those tangles and I haven't got
any since I've received this hair so I
haven't had this issue and then my
sister wanted this after she's seen
minds but she ended up getting their
curly hair which is this and not this
and I did her a whole curly Union of
unit very similar to this and it was
it's she's been wearing it and she's
not--she's definitely no no hair
connoisseur
she hasn't had any issues and I know
when his back when she complains she
will do what anything but she's like no
I haven't had no problem so I was like
okay this that good in my book finally
they're good in my book the only thing
is it's gonna match buddy as far as my
frontal goes it actually looks very
natural
I did have to plug it as you can see
there is in that tutorial video there is
a section about plucking as well and as
you can see I clipped all of this and
yeah it's good like I can go ahead and
part it I can move it and be really good
I tend to pluck my hair when I do my
units I tend to pluck them on the more
on the sides that I'm gonna wear it on
and use the other my part on this side
so I did okay I just wanted to say it
looked a little bald on camera because I
have the lightest most like Caucasian
stocking cap I could find cuz I am out
of almost like brown stocking caps so
don't worry I promise you it looks
really good in person but on camera I
was like oh girl I didn't go over crazy
looking okay you'll see in the tutorial
let's change it to this side just so
that it could look more natural and it's
not so predictable because you guys know
if I could work on the side part for the
rest of my life
everyday I would do it but I can't
because it gets boring after a while so
with this I wanted to give y'all some
flexibility I know somebody's gonna ask
right now is my hair wet it is not wet
isn't completely dry like completely
like some water was gonna come out it's
dry it's nothing in it at all
but it's still soft and that's because I
mixed the conditioner after I put the
amplifier on it I put the conditioner
and water put it in the sprayer but I
still use my um my beyond the zone he
projecting bottles Wednesday I use all
of the the orange stuff out of it
put those in the bottle spray and then
I'll be good
you just guys just make sure you keep
your hands right I can't say like I'm so
sick of saying this because I see all
too often Rossy girls be like oh I did
this to the hair like bleach and his
hair is a no-go do not do it okay I did
a strand test and it was not okay so if
you're thinking about color just thank
the hair for you I'm just being honest
this is not the hair for you so yeah
when I see people be like oh I have to
bleach it and then it turned into a mop
it turned into a Matt don't
not every hair that you buy especially
when it's expensive should be able to
bleach if you're getting his hair at a
very Alex first price if you know what
I'm talking about then you have to
understand you can't do everything with
this hair and this is a beautiful
pattern I just wish they matched they
don't but don't bleach it if you want to
wear it like this where like this just
don't bleach it okay cuz I'm gonna tell
you it's not gonna be a great situation
like it's just really not I am rocking I
believe I'm marketing I'm rocking 220
220 for 222 and I'm marking a 20-inch
frontal and this the frontal is a 13 by
4 so I wish it was longer I wish my part
went all the way back here but it
doesn't unfortunately but you guys know
I do like curly hair this is usually the
hair when I'm not testing out here that
I wear the most often just because it's
the most effortless it's very easy into
the point so if I have to give this a
grade from 1 to 10 I would give it a 7
and a half just because the pattern
definitely took a lot of points off for
me because I'm so like mad about this
like I know it's supposed to be deep way
but this is definitely deep way curly
and that's not a look that's not a
texture be quite curly is not a texture
so again both of them they they blend
fine if you don't care but it looks like
I have been wearing my real hair and
this is what it look like oh I look like
I have my real hair
in a beehive or some braids and then
down here I've been just flat ironing my
weave and I wanted to wear it curly
again so I took my real hair out and
then left my tracks in the back that's
what I'm looking like daddy hi cuz I
have a video where my hair yeah I have a
red a red coca-cola sweater on and it's
a red background I'm doing a little camp
song my hair looks very similar to this
my eyes are like blue or green or
something and I got these big hoops on
and now it was so uniformed and I'll
have that win to this day it was so
uniformed and I didn't get I was like it
was gonna be like that I'm have two rows
so yeah I'll eat great how many job to
start sending out hair that matches
because as you can see it's all of this
and I can't so anyway I hope you guys
enjoyed this I will catch you guys on my
next one if you guys are looking for the
tutorial for this video it will be
listed below and as well as on my
