this is like everything I'm trying to do
right now it's going completely and
utterly wrong culo it's been a rough one
all right - my hair my hair is from a
company called Ally great hair which is
off of Aliexpress and I'm rocking their
Peruvian straight which is four bundles
of what was 26 inches now I am 5 foot 4
and this is where this hits mean um and
I cut it so it's really like a 24 now
foot cut about two inches off and then I
have a 18 inch frontal from them as well
so this must front hole now I don't know
what it is about this hair that I'm not
liking specifically but it's something
that I don't like about it and I don't
know what it is it could be the fact
that this hair does not hold a curl I
just curled my hair like legit just but
it's still warm
um I don't know why this particular hair
doesn't like to hold Oh crow but it also
doesn't really hold a a flat iron really
well either I found his hair like twice
back-to-back and I have wore it out and
then he got poofy on me so it definitely
does have that very natural virgin like
feel to it when it comes to that because
I don't understand why this just does
not want to hold these are be in my hair
probably about into this video my hair
probably before I unfortunately um now
the shedding - this was great because I
didn't get any and using when the longer
the hair it seems like so more shedding
you're going to end up with which well
this is a cop blue gun wig so keep that
in mind too so my shedding could be due
to simple factors this is glued in it
wasn't it's really fun in
so take that into consideration as well
when I cut it it was easier cut but you
know I had no issues with that if the
hair was soft it still remained soft
I've looked very little to no products
in it just because I didn't want it to
be super duper stiff and I wasn't going
to put a lot of curls in it I just
wanted to have a bit of a body to it so
that when I do wear it it can move and
flow and have that whole feel to it but
um I don't know what it is about this
and I just don't like but it's something
it is something that I do not like um
the frontal was easy to bleach it was
easy to pluck it came a little pre plus
like it was that kind of hot everybody
should be named sparkles autism right
now where they kind of have like it's a
little more center on the front but I
still have to go through after I
bleached it and kind of kind of neaten
it up a little bit just all that it
could look a little bit more appropriate
to my head shape the luster in this hair
was very low to none so I have to
actually put some images because a my
hair just looked a little on the dull
side which I wasn't understanding now I
didn't have no something else yeah this
one didn't have no smells to it is one
that I just took out the box um which I
think I was in the back but um this
doesn't have any smell to it it didn't
have a smell tool when I got it it does
have a very natural Brown it's a very
natural Brown so I get closer so you
guys can see it's definitely like a 1b
for sure as you can see right here and I
do like the color you know and then I
did do a strength test on it and it
actually took color really well now what
I like what i suggest that you bleach
this hair kind of like how I did melody
with the streaking of front probably not
because it's kind of the same style
without the street oh no only because
unless you use like a really good color
corrector only because the color that I
got was a hat
a little green in it a little gray but
that kind of you know when you start
getting 20 colors that kind of usually
means that there's something else going
on in there they I believe this lace
that is my frontal and Swift lace I
don't believe that it's regularly
because it wasn't hard it's not really
thick it's quite thin and yeah you know
I still need to give me some new braids
so that could allow me to say that my
braids maybe the reason why I don't like
to install that could be what it is
because when I originally made this way
I had another set of braids so it did
fit me a little bit better so I wore one
before then and then I was wearing it in
between when I had just kind of did my
own thing and now that I have these
braids that are a little too big maybe
that could be the reason why I don't
necessarily like how my install looks
and it's not my favorite of all the
other insults trust and believe I'll be
at numerate this week um that could be
what it is I don't know because I feel
like if I wore this at a different point
that I would be obsessed with it but I'm
not and it's a very basic look it's
nothing special about this hairstyle at
all it's just there it's here you know
it's you know her for you girls and guys
we just want to do something very simple
and to the point
that's kind of what this is so I don't
know but I'll give a thought if I'm
going to grade them from one to ten then
I will give them a nine because there's
really nothing wrong with the hair as
opposed to I don't know what that green
hit is and I don't know why it doesn't
want to hold a curl and it doesn't want
to say select those soft head will bring
it down we'll go to it amen just to be
on the ferret side so what eight and a
half is what I'll give you guys Ellie
great I don't know why this hair just
doesn't want to see as you can see mine
was much tighter than this and I am
running my fingers through it but I've
had hair that I've done this with before
and I've run my entire life through it
and it has not failed so and I did not
put know any hairspray in it whatsoever
I definitely left it as it was I'm five
foot four so yeah like I said once
before it hits me about right here curls
so it's probably like again like a 24
now versus a
six that it wasn't in my frontal was an
18-inch and I just really cut it to
frame my face a little bit more but that
was pretty much it I didn't do anything
that was you know crazy are you know
over the top or anything just because I
didn't feel like it was necessary and
plus I've had this hair for I mean you
know so you guys know like to check my
hair a little bit longer and I was going
to do originally I was going to cut it
and then I decided not to cut it just
because I wanted to see how it would be
and Holly was fair would it be in this
long because you know they say the
longer the hair the more it's going to
tangle the longer the hair the more it's
going to shed and I haven't got any
necklace-- the thing is some of y'all's
not pull out your hair the proper way
some of y'all I'll be seeing on
Instagram
y'all be coming out your hair like boots
you girl you gonna be nice and bold you
always want to go from the bottom you
start from down here and you go all the
way and just make sure that when you do
wear hair you brush this in the back to
brush that make where all that sweat is
going to be where he was holding his
hand in the back of your neck at the
club girl make sure you brush that to
confirm y'all don't be brushing your
hair out and combing your hair after
y'all wear it job take it off and throw
it on a dresser and then put it back on
the next day and then before you know it
all this in the back starts getting
tangled like nobody's business and that
you want to blame the company sometimes
it is a company girl sometimes issue
because I want to have a car and your
car starts to go to hell and you just
got it you it catch up with the second
one or could have just been a fact that
I can't put in regular bath and this is
and I'm probably putting super to plan
so yeah I'll give them a nice eight and
a half for this but I don't know what it
is I don't know I don't want to say that
it's them so i'ma go I'm gonna go back
up to a nine because it could be my
friend so an eye is what I'm gonna give
them a Legree I okay so let me know what
