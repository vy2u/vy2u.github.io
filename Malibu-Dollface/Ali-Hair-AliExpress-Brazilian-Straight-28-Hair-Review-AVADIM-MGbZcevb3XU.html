nice intro and there's a long hair which
I'm in love with it is here so long so
this is from grace hair and this is
their Brazilian straight hair and I
believe I'm wearing don't quote me but
I'm almost certain that I'm wearing for
28 and a 20 inch of closure I do not
have a frontal even though it's really
flat they did not have a matching
frontal so I opted to do a closure so
usually as you guys see I got all my
first achi on because I felt like the
black Donatella because of how bone
straight this hair is and you guys know
I did blonde Versace befo so I wanted to
do like a black version of this with all
black bone straight hair and usually um
my hair isn't this long and when I do do
it this long I love to do it within a
side part and if I do do it look how it
flowed oh yo um and when I usually do it
this long it usually has layers in it
there are not one layer all this is all
straight so when I was doing makeup I
was like what kind of hair I mean what
kind of look could I do with this
because you guys know like to theme my
look sometimes and I just felt like this
would be very Versace
if Donatella did what she does do black
hair and the Prasad she adds but for
majority of them they're blonde I think
it would look something like this off
when in my closet and pulled out
almost about my skirt I fell my jacket
I'm Velma bill I found everything and
decided to go ahead and it was fun I
really like this this is some of the
buttery soft hair that I've ever had
like ever ever and it's really nice like
look how look at the luster I didn't put
nothing in it this is what it looks like
on its own so gift God now as you guys
see his little crinkle in here I was
going to originally thought about his
hair because it was so long was in a
different direction I was going to do
some crimps girl y'all know I hate
crimes but I went to Sally's to get some
caps to make my wigs and I have brought
another one because I was literally dis
lazy to find my other one I just brought
a new one and it came with a free
crimper so I crimped it to see how the
hair crimp and then I straighten it to
see how much it would straighten after I
did it then I did do the curl test on
his hair and he holds a curl beautifully
and I had those long hot dog curls
because ain't no layers in my hair but
it actually did hold and the crimps are
crimped on one side and it was cream for
about five days and then the curls were
in for a week and they both hold they
were both much looser well the crimps
wasn't loose at all they was just
but the curl had actually failed but for
it to have been in that long it didn't
fall very much um straightening this
hair was a breeze I didn't have much of
an issue and especially when I get
straight here cuz this is what its
natural state is in I usually don't have
any issues with um keeping it straight
but sometimes hair when it is straight
it doesn't want to stay straight and
this hair was kind of no different it
gave me no issues with straightening
them but I noticed like right here after
a while I'm gonna have to keep doing
this to keep it straight because you're
gonna wanna in the back it's not going
to want to say it straight of course as
a front but you can solve that with a
little bit of hairspray and you spray
and it'll stay I didn't want to put
major product in his hair because it is
so pretty and I didn't want to lose my
flow when you start putting crazy
amounts of product in your hair it's not
gonna do this anymore it's gonna be very
stiff no matter how long it is it's not
going to flows when you throw your hair
like
is you want your hair to sit it's
supposed to go back into place like that
if the hair does this of some sort then
you or your stylist didn't put your hair
in right it does this and it lays back
down like it's supposed to then you did
a great job it doesn't do that then
you're going to keep doing this and like
I did a video about when I was in the
car and in that specific wig that I had
on in the car was a light yaki way so I
had to keep brushing and combing it
throughout today because it does it
doesn't do this it it likes to get
caught and this hair is so silky and
it's so fine as far as shedding goes I
haven't got crazy amounts of shedding
and right now I'm not getting any
shedding and when I received the hair it
was kind of the same thing yeah it's
more so like see see it likes to fall
right back into place as it like it's
supposed to and when you get straight
hair like this it is this long be sure
to wrap your hair at night because if
you don't your hair is so long like the
natural luster in his hair is because
this is how it came just like this so
you see how it's shiny but it's not
crazy and you don't want a crazy amount
of shine in your hair especially your
straight here because it's going to
start to look plastic and it's not like
you got a lot of oil in your hair also
do not put lots of oil in your hair when
it is straight like this because all up
in here in front is gonna start to break
apart and it's just going to start
looking greasy so grace hair popping
popping this is gray hair for a photo
shoot this is great wind hair um I
actually have some longer hair coming
can you believe it and I'm excited
because I'm gonna put that to the test
to see if it's gonna do this I'm a layer
that hair I highly doubt if I'm going to
wear it like this because I just did
this I already have a wig that does this
um the closure
I like the closure a lot it wasn't um
hard to put in I'm just so used to not
working with closures anymore it felt
really weird that I can only kind of
part my hair right here if I wanted to
side part I have to move my wig I'm so
used to you
having a free-flowing oh thing now
color-wise that was my only hang-up with
this hair because I really wanted to
bleach this hair to the high heavens and
put like a turquoise on it but I did a
strand test and my hair turned very ng
and it wasn't a nice orange like always
about the list and go to like white it
was like stop No so I personally
wouldn't bleach this hair um and maybe
it's just mine in particular but it just
definitely had a very weird orange hue
to it and I feel like if I bleach it
then it's going to end up not being what
I want and then if I end up frying the
hair at the ends it's just gonna look
terrible once I review it so that was
kind of my experience with the color
wise it just didn't really work out for
me like I wanted it to but aside from
the color it holds a curl the shedding
is very minimal to none um if the flow
is popping and the bundles were pretty
full you know a lot of times when you
get a lot of long hair the bundles are
very short and these were nice lengthy
bundles because I did about the bags but
it is super-duper-duper flat in the bag
so they the West themselves were
actually quite out constructed very well
I didn't have issues with a frame or
when I cook as I did cut them on the
ends of my tracks because I wanted it to
be as flat as possible so when I did cut
them I didn't get those you know
sometimes you cut your weft and then you
end up with a whole bunch of hair just
shedding out of it because you have been
already you cut the bundle so I didn't
deal with that so they were greatly tied
I believe they were machine tied and not
hand dyed oh they don't look hand tied
at all but just look at the flow you
know just watch my intro again y'all
because it's like get on and this is
what you want when you want bones
straight I only Hannibal realness you do
not want to end up in a situation where
your hair is you have this
much hair it is just it's going to be a
stiff unattractive non flowy mess when I
go out with this hair in public it float
with the wind blows that's kind of a
downfall I feel like um a taboo from the
Black Eyed Peas right now
yeah um but yeah we you know the wind
blows you want your hair to be flowy and
you want it to blow - you do not want
your hair to be stiff and I see too many
girls that's the sad part see a lot of
girls with that issue and it's like why
is your hair so ridiculously not moving
and you have in about 18 bundles so
again I have four bundles of Brazilian
straight with a um a 28 inch and then I
have a 20 inch I believe a lace closure
and yes guys they they did they did the
thing with this one so make sure you
guys click the links below and make sure
you are watching my intro again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
