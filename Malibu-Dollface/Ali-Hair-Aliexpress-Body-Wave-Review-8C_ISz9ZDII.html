drying but we angle do that but i'm
gonna talk about my hair guys Geils
um it's from great hair and i've
reprobates here before i don't however
remember what hair i had from them but i
remember like in the air I just don't
remember what it was
so this is my body wave hair and I have
into twenty-twos no I haven't 224 of 22
and a 20 and I think a 18 inch a closure
I've had this hair that things like 3
months it's been somewhere around there
like this hair has just been a minute
for this hair and this looks a little
different than I normally how a body
wave because I really wanted to do like
a natural look with this and as you guys
see I actually bleached the bottoms of
it cuz a lot of you guys always ask me
does this here take color can you color
his hair so I wanted to go ahead and do
that after I've had some wear and tear
out of it to see how it would react to
actually putting color in it after I
watched a conditioned it and all that
like if it's still gonna give take the
color very well um I what I did
differently from this hair then I
usually do it especially when I install
as I did too because I wanted my hair I
really just wanted for 24 and I don't
know what happened within a conversation
that I even didn't ask for and they
didn't send it or whatever but I ended
up with two shorter bundles then I
really liked so I took the last two of
my 24 cuz I have 22 24 is in the back of
2220 so I took the last two bundles of
the 24 and I put them at the very top
around my closure so it looks as if all
my hair is one length but really it's
not so if you ever have here you can't
afford more hair if you the lengths are
like two inch difference you can do that
to make it seems as if all the hair is
one length
really it's not except for my closure of
course which I can't do that with um I
was I feel like a camp counselor today
like the hood one that just don't do
their job I'm kind of here on community
service like that's what I feel like I
haven't um a lace closure as well my
I've had this hair for quite some time
and my bracing uh also my blending in
the front and exactly with a person you
know when you're blending on where
you're just on this card I will say that
this I give it a strong be strong be the
reason why I don't give it a strong a -
or a is because I did and have dealt
with a lot of shedding with this hair um
not to the point where I can't wear it
cuz obviously as you can see I've been
wearing it and enough to throw color in
it but it just was I don't know what it
is about this particular hair and you
guys know I like a lot of body wave hair
so I wear it often but this hair kind of
gave me the blues when it came to the
shedding because like now I went back
because I redid the wig see I get
nothing out I went back and I still my
West because and I haven't done that in
so long
it's been ages but I went ahead and
sealed my web speak I was just getting
more shedding than I liked and I know
I'd like to throw some bleach on it and
I just didn't want to make the situation
worse but I'm like I'm maybe that
actually helped and it did I'm gonna
start from the kitchen and yeah I think
I got one strand which is just that
little one but other than that I don't I
don't get any shedding anymore so um my
advice from this point forward is when
you buy hair from Aliexpress I
personally would just go ahead before
you install go ahead and um to Lowe's
web it does make a world of a difference
it's just very time consuming and that's
kind of the thing that I really don't
like is that you you kind of fall into
this issue a lot when you have hand-tied
lips because they are hand hood so
they're not machine whips that means
that sometimes they're a little it's
easier for as the hair gets a little
older it does tend to want to slip out
of that actual track sometimes because
it is hand tied it's not machined I as a
just too tight within the web sometimes
it does want to pull out and then
they'll just come out ridiculously I've
dealt with both the texture itself
though has remained now I always told
you guys I'm not one for putting color
in a lot of my hair that's not straight
because I find the time a lot of times
depending on the company that the hair
will end up actually losing the pattern
so you end up with some way to here up
here and then straight down here it just
depends this hair did not do that I
wanted to see if it was gonna do that
after that after as long as I've had it
and it did not do that I went ahead how
bleached the bottoms of this I bleached
the bottom of this hair with um some VW
bleach and I use 40 um 40 volume
peroxide and then I took after I did it
it was kind of like a um you know like a
very brownish color like it was isn't it
was about to start going over into the
blonde area so I took this a door color
and hot pink and I put this on top of it
and it kind of gave me this reddish
color at the bottom it kind of matches
my scar become me so I want to just kind
of see I only did the tips only because
I didn't if the hair was gonna just like
burn and singe on me I wanted to at
least have something left to show y'all
but I will go back and actually bleach
the entire wig but not this to make it
all probably up to about here this color
at the bottom and I actually have
brought so many of these because I
actually have this color because I
actually purchased this color four
bottles of it at five dollars a bottle
because I can't find it anywhere else
um because I had got some hair and I was
gonna diet pink but then when I actually
got the hair that I was gonna die pink
it was already pink so yeah this is
actually coming up you guys I'm working
on this plug right now so I had all this
extra pink color laying around I was
like why don't I just go ahead and tip
it up but it did come out more of a red
it's like you have to really look at it
to see that it's really pink but it did
take the color very well it did
get dry it still feels the same texture
as the top it still feels at the bottom
it doesn't feel like hey at the bottom
before I did this I actually have
straightened all of the hair because I
intended to wear the hair in a different
style so after I decided to change my
mind and I was gonna put color at the
bottom I went ahead and was like okay
well I'm just not gonna wear it straight
cuz I'm have to straighten it no I'm
about to go ahead and bleach it then I'm
gonna go put some water on it and then
I'm out to rewash everything then I'm
gonna strain it again that's one it was
just too much working - I just want to
put it's just not necessarily I got a
stray twigs somewhere so this is after
being straighten one time and being
washed four times no three times because
I did a initial wash not cohosh but I
did a watch when I got it
then I bleached it and I washed it and
then I put the color on it and then I
watched a video so yeah it's been three
washes I haven't done a co-wash on the
hair as of yet and it doesn't seem like
it's gonna need one but I do I will do
it like in-between especially because
it's color at the bottom because I
bleached it so I definitely know because
it will get crunchy on you real quick
but other than that I will that's why I
give this um hair a nice be from grace
hair because it actually is very nice
hair once you seal those webs but uh
without the lesbian silat I did
experience a nice amount of shading
which you can't tell because my hair
still looks very flowy and I was
shedding it was shedding for about a
week before I actually steal them so I
gave it some time and I remember I was
at the mall and I was trying on some
shoes and you know you have the hair in
the back like this and I went like this
and I got like a good four strands that
I was just not very happy with and they
seemed as if they came out a little too
easy so I was like okay we don't have to
just go ahead and redo this so I took
all the tracks out redid it sealed all
of them left them to sit and then we
sell them back in and once I've done
that so just to kind of avoid any issues
or problem
then I personally would just go ahead
and sell them just to be on the safe
side I use the that the aliens um I
think it's something free like don't
fray or non prey I forgot what it's got
but it's for like your clothes and stuff
like that you can get it at Michael's or
Joanne's
and you just run it across the webs and
then you just let it sit and it just
pretty much stiffens all the hair in
there so I just will not move and it
will not pull or yank out I used a
little bit of after I when when it was
all waiting it was drug drying I put it
I don't know why I got so many comments
about pro cream but for those who are
asking I just used this one which is the
the curl calm down cream from Garnier
Fructis and a little bit of this goes a
long way I use a little bit of this and
it's here so that's why it's kind of
still a little more like up in here
because I didn't brush through this it's
a little more wavy and something like
right here then it is on the top because
I'm running my fingers and all that to
the top but I just put a lot if you put
too much of this your hair will be stiff
it will be crunchy and it just going to
look gross and your hair is going to
feel nasty like right now I don't feel
anything in it it feels good but if you
do put too much of this and I can tell
you I don't have this program for the
longest a little bit and I when I say a
little bit I mean like for my entire
head I probably use about this much and
that should be enough to actually do
your entire head because it's going to
do it as opposed to doing running
through and I usually put this in with
just some warm water run it through and
then it'll bring this pattern back if
it's even gone but in case it is gone
for whatever reason um then I definitely
make sure I go ahead and put this in
just on my hair will be one umm you see
it all have the same pattern in it
nothing will be different but that's
about it
so the Garnier Fructis a crow calm down
is and you can tell this is because it's
just new at the top and this is nowhere
near me okay so make sure you guys are
visit grace hair I'll put the link below
to this good old
happy and again I use um to 24 of 22 and
a 20 and I have an 18 inch lace closure
and then to dye the ends of my hair I
use b/w powder bleach with for the value
for oxide on the ends and I use adores
hot pink on my tips catch-all in my next
one boots</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
