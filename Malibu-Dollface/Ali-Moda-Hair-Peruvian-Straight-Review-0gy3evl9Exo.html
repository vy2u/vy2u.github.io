not even funny
so this hair and then I'm rocket is from
a Alex press company called Ali Mota
hair on mo da motor hair and this is
their Peruvian straight with a matching
frontal as well as you guys can see and
I didn't a little bit different than I
usually do with my straight hair that I
did here which was I cut a lot of layers
enjoy it okay so as you guys can see it
is a lot of value going I thought my
sink a low key like I feel like
telehealth would like hello hello Ali
Woodson black it was I just cut a lot of
layers here in the front so that I could
get all of this here on the side which
is very bombshell very guest girl like
you know I'm just something that was
different that I wasn't used to now I've
been knowing how to do this layered look
for the longest time I guess these
glasses the work right the longest time
but the thing that I don't like about
this look is the fact that you have to
cut a lot of hair on okay just as a side
note I haven't five bundles of hair okay
five and it doesn't look like five
because the amount of hair that I had to
cut in order to get this look but I will
say that
because I did have five I was able to do
it usually I wear only other about well
usually about four bundles so usually
I'll be a little nervous to do this look
because of that reason I don't want to
cut all myself and then my hair so it's
looking like super thin but this was
just enough that I was able to get the
volume that I needed to keep so I can
get all of this niceness
now I will say off strip some of my
favorite hair so far and 2020s
everything I didn't want to do it bad
because this here is like everything it
curled dye these curls have been e'en
for a week okay a week now mind you I
usually let my hair sit but they have
literally been like freestanding curls
has been brush them out put them on a
mannequin head and globe all day okay so
yes when I first got it I was wearing
the straight because it is their
Peruvian strength texture but I decided
okay well no because it was just getting
really hot and I don't really know how
much I would actually like to wear this
hair if it was you know in the
summertime something with the only way I
could probably beat this with the heat
is actually to curl it
so after about like a week or so wearing
I decided to go ahead and just chop it
and I put a lot of you but worked out
I feel like LaToya Jackson now know that
so the frontal oh now on my paper
holmes-sama say my paper on the damn
paper they sent me five bundles of 30
inch now as you can see my hair is
nowhere here it starting anybody it was
long 20 out using it it was long I cut a
lot off just because of the style that I
was doing this style with and my cm
require like eight bundles for it to be
this long and in this the luminous from
I like you personally so I cut a lot of
it off now it says that my frontal is
this here than my frontal is a 13 by 4
but I'm almost certain that this is a 13
by 6 because the judging by 4 would not
come this far back so maybe they
accidentally sent me a 13 by 6 I don't
know but this is not definitely a 13 by
4 which is fine with me girl because you
know it works but um yeah I I'm obsessed
with this like legit
obsessed with his love and you know hang
on Oh handsome on the dance lo what you
playing I decided to keep the look that
I have from the last video just because
why not you know um as far as shedding
gold I got a little bit when I first
received the hair but it wasn't anything
that was crazy
it wasn't excessive it wasn't like oh my
god I'm gonna die it was just a little
bit here and there now that I have
gotten you know this hair and I've cut
it I haven't got any more shading after
I watched it for about the sixth time I
did notice however when I'm
straightening this here I have to be a
little bit heavier on the product then
you normal because it seems like the
straightening process takes a little bit
more that's it it just in the fact that
I have so many bundles in um I don't
know I can't really pinpoint what the
reason for that was but after I actually
put a little oomph into the flat iron I
was fine like I said curling it has been
great I've used you know my knife um
heat spray so I just like to use when I
Flatiron are you like to use this spray
and then when I flat iron with it I like
to use this spray which is this the
Tresemme that is the number 5 so it's
the maximum hold and it'll help you hold
all your curls for a long period of time
so that it'll stay like this no matter
what you do your hair will actually stay
in place once you take it off when doing
this I use quite a bit of that
particular hairspray just because of the
fact that it's going is not as very
light so I want to use more than enough
so that my hairs won't be sticky as you
can see I can run my fingers through it
and they're very bouncy
everything is very voluminous it moves I
don't have any issues with you know it
getting snagged or it's like extra
sticky or anything like that so in love
with this legit in loped I like I don't
even think I'm taking this off tonight
this is on the ear girl
I want to wake up like come on be honest
you know shut up win today so as far as
the colouring process go with this I
don't see why not you couldn't already
there
it ain't give me no issues when I do my
strand test with it I just don't think I
would do this is another one of those
hair
I only necessarily think that I would do
it as far as bongos like the 613 is
color but if you want to do like
something like a brown or a copper are
you going to lighten it just to put
another color over it and I don't really
see an issuer problem with that so
overall alley motor you guys definitely
get a nice a - for me from me because of
the coloring you guys just don't know
the bone on there um again I asked her I
did that one review article in the bill
I just feel like all here should be able
to go to 613 with no problem and if it
does then you know your low-grade for me
I'm just saying but let me know how you
guys like this okay let me know I'm just
trying to wrap to begin to turn your
videos cool we're gonna turn around the
earth and see the bug jazz yes yes just
like so let me know what y'all think
about this look and I will catch you in
my next one I said Oh sir</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
