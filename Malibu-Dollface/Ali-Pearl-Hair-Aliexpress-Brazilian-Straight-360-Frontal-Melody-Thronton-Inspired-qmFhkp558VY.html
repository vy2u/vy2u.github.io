of my precious breath are you not
colouring
I'm sure that I look a little bit
different from which I've just seen in
my intro and that's because I had
somewhere to go so I shot my intro I
left and now I'm back so forgive me
people okay so to my hair and I'm gonna
just start off this video by saying this
is by far my favorite look this is my
favorite hair this is my favorite wig
that I have made this year thus far okay
so this hair is from a Aliexpress vendor
called Ally pearl hair and this is their
Brazilian straight hair okay now I am
rocking two bundles of 26 inch and two
bundles of 24 inch and I'm also walking
at 360 pronto that I did not glue the
back down imma show that in two separate
videos just because I like 360s but not
for the whole ponytail up thing I just
don't feel like at any point I will be
wearing the bun um but what I do like
about 360 frontals is that it's easier
for me to get the baby here on the sides
like I need to and for everything to be
laid down like I need to versus a
regular frontal and that's because when
I do do my wigs I put the front tools I
pull them as much as I can so they won't
be loose enough for it um and they
usually come about right here like
they'll stop here and then my truck
starting back um I know most front
wheels are made for ear to ear but I
just don't feel like that ever works for
me like I just don't like the way that
that looks I like more of a snug look
but these because they go all the way
around then I'm able to steal because
I'm only on when you put it on and when
you get it is just like when you get it
it's just it goes all the way around and
then this section is open for you to put
your tracks so what you end up with is
just a whole budget here you have to
fill in but there is nothing all of this
around here is still one unit so
therefore if I wanted to I could take
this I can pull this
like this into a ponytail if I wanted to
and there is no trucks or anything
showing because it goes all the way
around okay bring it come on come bring
your back bring it back come on any
minute now
there we go so um that's what I love
about these and I think what I'm gonna
start doing is just requesting 360s
all the time because they seem to be
much easier and I love the fact that it
came with an adjustable strap which is
always a plus because you can make it as
tight or as loose as you want I do
however fine and I already put in my
order for my custom wig head block um I
will keep my styrofoam head sock to put
them on there after I'm done but I
noticed that a lot of these heads are
just like they're not big enough for
what I'm getting so I had a little space
in the back so I kind of had a like fold
over the 360 in the back and then sew it
down and then go ahead and put my hair
because it just was it was it was way
too it was a little baggy um so to the
hair well first off I want to say this
is my fav my new favorite straight hair
okay I know I said another company but
they've been blown out the water by this
one Oh better ally pearl this hair came
in such a great beautiful straight like
it's equivalent to you know in my pack
hair because the Harris process is super
straight so it's just you get one of
those and a lot of times they says it
says on their website that this hair is
virgin hair but I just refuse to believe
in somebody's virgin here would be that
straight like it's straight I'll put a
photo here of what it looked like after
I had went ahead and did the color which
I'll get into in a second um but this is
what it looked like and it was
ridiculously straight now was I'm a fan
of straight hair period so the fact that
it was I'd have to do anything to it
especially after I washed it and I call
wash it and it still kept a beautiful
luster and it was still very straight
it didn't get kind of curly on me like
it was some body weight that they flat
iron or something like that it was legit
beautiful and straight and I was just
like I'm like this is what I need cuz a
lot of times what happens is when you do
receive straight hair from any vendor
I've got
is from like my us-based companies you
know some of the the companies that I've
worked with that have been to the
Philippines and and India to get their
hair from actual people it's not just
processed hair it's actually virgin hair
that the ends because it was you know
just growing out from that aren't always
the best so when you try to fight iron
some hair and make it super duper
straight it still has a bit of um you
know in your hair after you fun irony is
poofy it kind of has that feel to it so
my hair is never as bone straight as I
would like it and you would think I
would have kept this hair like this but
because this hair was inspired by melody
um and she was everybody's second lead
um from Pussycat Dolls and you know her
part in buttons is my favorite quite
frankly and if you guys knew me during
my myspace times and when I had Helio
and that whole thing I was a huge
Pussycat Doll fan and um after she went
through the dogs if I understand it she
went and did her solo thing which was
pissed on your blacklist which is still
one of my favorite mixtapes ever I'm
smoking gun lipstick and guilt
bulletproof or some of my favorites on
that mixtape so I was looking for
something not too long ago you know I
was just kind of looking for what could
I do that still color but it's not
overkill and she had made a splash and I
forgot where she was but she had more
this see-through dress and she had her
signature piece died and she had her
boobies out she was a very classic
moment for her and I came across that
picture looking for something else and I
was like I really want to do this I
wonder if I can achieve this look with
the frontal so I went ahead and kind of
looked up and see wanted to see kind of
what her hair looked like I had to
really start looking now like okay so
how am I gonna achieve that look when I
look at the photo of her hair then I
noticed that she had only had about this
much in the front now when I did do this
I had a part that was right here so some
of this was on the other side as you see
in this photo um by what I did decide
change it up a little bit which allowed
me to um kind of just put the streak
right here so initially when I first did
my hair I was wearing it with the two
and then I changed it probably like a
couple of days ago I was like I'm gonna
do just the one streak here in the front
and other thing I did was some basic
layering in the front here so that I
could get this layered look as of right
here so everything could lay like it
should now I love this look because it
still gives me a bit of classy but it
has edge to it as well so the classic
comes from the curls but the edge is
obviously the streak I use the VW white
bleach um I just sectioned off just this
little piece here in the front I put
some foil
I actually I use saran wrap because I
had a foil um I just did that and I use
for me volume bleach and I used um I
mean Korea volume developer with the
regular b/w bleach I left it on for
about I left it honestly on and be
honest with you
I left it on until they started to turn
a color that I wanted it to turn so
everything here in the front I went into
all of this turnt the color that I
wanted it and then I washed it out but I
had bleached my nuts before blow dried
it then did this so I still bleach my
mouth so it can ended up being the UH
the color that I wanted and it came out
great and his hair took color great this
is actually blond it's not green it's
not red it didn't break off it's still
all one and Ally pearl hair is my new
favorite okay cuz this I don't think I
would have got this look with any other
hair legit I don't and I'm super duper
happy with this look like let me know if
y'all like this I would have loved to do
this with like a white streak in the
front probably do the reverse where I
would get my frontal already white and
then just do the rest black and leave
that because trying to bleach that too
like this gonna be broke off it's just
no overall I will give this hair legit
shedding none track
were beautiful um the hair the tracks
were not too full that was another thing
that I wanted to point out the tracks
were not crazy for you guys no I like my
hair full but you see every all the hair
that I have right now is all the hair
pulled forward this is enough hair for
the average person because his hair is
kind of long it's the longest I have is
26 so this hair is long but it's not
overwhelming me it's not crazy long so
all of this is one all of this is the
other it has a beautiful luster to it I
put no Flatiron spray in it because I
legit didn't have to fight on it I let
it air dry I Flatiron my frontal my
frontal did need a little bit of
Flatiron I did not press it however I
only fight earned it and um yes so I was
so recommend this like this made me
excited again and I love this look and
the frontal was easy to apply like it
looks very very very natural don't mind
this loopies right here but um other
than that girl ally pearl y'all popping
like I'm really a fan right now I mean
even my low yes
gave me all that and and I don't believe
I can't be wrong but I don't remember
plucking this one I believe this one
came pre plucked and if it didn't please
disregard that I did pluck because I did
three weeks within that one day so I do
remember doing a lot of plucking on one
but I don't believe that this was one of
them but um if it was did that if it
wasn't they did that um yeah if you guys
are interested in this please click the
links below and let me know um how you
like this and side note I will be doing
my hot glue gun tutorial because this
wig was made with just that so I sold my
frontal down and glued the rest and it's
super duper flat okay
took a wash nobody's business and it's
very easy to do and very inexpensive to
do and it also just ensures that your
install for your weave or your wig it's
going to be
very very very select so I hope you guys
enjoyed this shot out to alley pearl
hair for doing the damn thing cuz this
is don't you
and I'll catch y'all in my next one and
happy belated birthday to melody and
thank you for being the inspiration for
this look okay it's kind of like her
makes wit Ruby mom makes wit Olivia
would you get my point
alright peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
