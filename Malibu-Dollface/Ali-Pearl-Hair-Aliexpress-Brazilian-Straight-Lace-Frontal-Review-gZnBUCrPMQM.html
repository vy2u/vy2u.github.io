no I'm kind of arrow okay
like I thought oh like this real quick
well is this there's a specific picture
of alia that I've seen share these
really dog Gucci shades on these are not
Gucci they're much more affordable than
the Gucci one she had on and actually
seen those recently on a consignment
store site that I shop it and I was
going to buy them I didn't but I'm kind
of happy I did now cause one thing I was
doing Photoshop it can't these nice and
red and we could so I can actually talk
about my hair which is yo look I just
let y'all y'all seen in my intro already
how slick my hair is right now okay
let's talk about that okay me and my
wife back let's talk about that
look how nice and flowy this is and you
guys know I love to talk about how when
my hair doesn't want to stay straight
with this ain't one of them honey baby
stays nice and straight so this is
actually from a company called Ally curl
hair and you guys know I work with a
leaper before what I had did my also
favorite look which is Moody and I
believe this actually might be the same
hair it might be a different origin but
whatever they did to this hair BAE BAE
let me tell you it swings so
effortlessly and I love hear that like
this is some hair I wear to the beach
and be fine with or we're on a windy day
and I'd be good with because I know for
a fact that my hair is going to stay
like this all day not going to act a bit
it's not going to get poofy it's gonna
say like this all freakin day no matter
if it's hot or if it's cold so today I
didn't go to beach but I went to pull
and
to get all be cute in the whole thing
and I wanted to see how this one piece
old walking jacket too but I don't
really feel like I need a jacket just so
unnecessary I can see his well my
background is nice and Yeller hey I
wanted to kind of do like this I was out
the little the buggy what is it does
yeah grow that that red thing or what my
little the little sleepy things came
with which says Allie pearl on here and
then it says that is 100% is I'll
expresses number one and it says 100%
unprocessed human hair howdy pearl is
again the site that I did my infamous of
straight for that actually the intro
photo for my intro for my young reviews
so that hair is still hitting okay you
guys a female Instagram you guys are
seeing me on snapchat with my melody
hair and I still wear it this is also I
believe this is their Brazilian straight
I believe they sent me the same hair
twice and I decided to do something with
the middle part this time because you
guys look you know y'all know I'd love
to do the middle part action because
it's really cute or whatever so this is
what it looks like after all and this is
the luster I don't know if you guys can
tell let's see hold on guys
and my eyes are red because I know
somebody gonna say the thing thinks that
I'm high and that's not it guy it is
3:17 in the morning and my contest is
silica so yeah I don't get out I'll make
a video about that anyway so I don't
know if you guys can tell about the
luster and this error we're going to do
this it's hard to tell because the
lighting setup has to be different when
I have different backgrounds because
sometimes they come out and then they
wash me out or sometimes you just I'm
not the focal point at the background so
it's not as shiny as it would be so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to turn
these lights off and leave this one on
so you guys can see the luster and there
so now you can see the true luster of
the hair now that I've change
the lighting around a little bit and the
swage okay I will say that this like
look how sleek this is okay this
frontals oh oh I bleach this little copy
and paste me down and I am so good and
lays so flat it's not even funny and you
guys know I'm not really one for a
middle part all the time this is like my
photo let me get my glasses girls or
someone else I am oh you guys know that
I'm not really going for the middle part
all the time this is usually an
occasional look I don't I don't do this
all the time
so baby says no this is this is some of
the best straight hair that I have had
awesome Aliexpress for those who are
wondering it washes like a dream
although I will say about this in order
for it to stay this thin straight what
you have to do is you have to condition
it very well
you use cheap-ass conditioner I cannot
stress this fast enough to you God even
if you use cheap products on your hair
it's going to go to hell really quick
okay so if you want to keep the lustre
like I see a lot of comments from people
say when I first started it was
beautiful then I washed it and then
sometimes like I've always said - it's
cool until it water hidden let's see
what I do but I will say that I've
watched melody I don't know how many
times and I've never had an issue I
watched his hair three times since I've
had it I received it here in February
and I'm not having any issues as at all
not even here in the back I'm not having
no issues and that's usually very
uncommon usually I feel like I'm getting
a little bit of something about here or
it doesn't like to say straight it
doesn't necklace in the back and it
actually stays straight so Ally pearl
you guys get a 10 out of 10 for me
because normally I have a couple of
complaints about the frontal Russell's
great I taped it down so it came free
plus so that was the thing
I loved about it as well and that no it
came already ready to play and that's
the thing that I love about this company
they have the Raiders oh yes they get a
ten out of ten for me for our experience
and especially the price of their chairs
come baby bag you cannot go wrong with
this oh you guys get to tear let me know
what you decide to do with it if you
decide to do this look again I am
wearing if I didn't mention this at all
you probably seen it in the intro but
I'm actually wearing two bundles of 22
and two bundles of 24 and that actually
hits me a believer so hit me at the bud
and I'm 5 foot 4 it literally did use me
my book wrote but yeah I'm 5 foot 4 and
it hits me right there so if you guys
are interested in this hair let me know
again I've reviewed for them before I
always stress this and I can't stress it
enough if you guys decide to purchase
any hair that I review don't let me be
your only review look at other reviews
from actual customers I am a hair
reviewer so take that for what it is but
make sure you guys visit actual
customers who purchase this hair and
then you make up your mind before you
buy anything in life ok I can't be the
only thing what they sent me is what
they sent me but I will say this is some
of my favorite hair and I haven't had
any issues with the other unit that I
made from them is one of my favorite
units like ever from Aliexpress so
histor you know make sure you guys hit
