and a new look that I don't do too often
my overall this is the front row when
you take your time
so this areas from sexy hair and they
contacted me and asked me to do this
review for they have a whole line of
color hair that are ombre with dark
roots and speaking of which I want to
give y'all kind of an idea of how many
colors they actually offer so it seems
that they have a purple of Burgundy a
blue already they have a green they have
a green they have obviously two 613
they're having with like longer like
these rings and they have it with longer
roots
- if you want them to be they have like
the diagram briefly I didn't really take
this look like on a nice low peachy
color Beijing okay
so they contacted me and asked me did I
want to like review anything from this
particular collection and I'm like yeah
these colors really seem nice and they
look what color do you want
and honestly I have not had red hair and
a long time so I was like what's red
less you Rick and I'm obsessed with this
now you guys know I've done this color
before I've had it with a few other
companies or whatever young aha feel
about mention and other people to know
people stuff doesn't know what we're
here for
but they send me a matching
so and been one of these are like crazy
this hair is 30 inches so you know it
hits me back here like such grim giving
all them inches and right now I just
throw my audio speakers yeah so to the
actual hair itself here's okay cuz y'all
know it looks beautiful and it's all
nice and all great but you know we here
for a reason okay so one of the things
that I will say that I was not really
used to with this is because I'm not
used to wearing when I do color hair is
really now I don't use dark roots
anymore if you guys notice probably the
last five and six looks I've done that
had a color they was all just the color
from the root down so I'm not really
used to wear my hair where there's a
color here like a color variant I'm
looking at the monitor I'm sorry guys
there's a color variance right here so
what ends up happening is I don't like
the fact that the color that's right
here
it goes down like this I'm not a big fan
of that at all
like nothing a little bit okay um I'm
sure if I would've wore this in a side
part which I know I was expecting you
know it seems like every time I have red
hair it's usually in a middle part I
don't know that's never planned but we
here so that's one thing that I'm not
the biggest fan of and then I'll put a
photo here and this is when I was
actually installing the hair I've
noticed that the line of demarcation
between the red I mean the black in the
red was like girl like somebody was like
like what a marker so girl we cannot be
any street game clock the house cuz our
our situation is you know people like it
I don't like this though I'm not I'm not
ain't mad at it though you know relying
man and it away but I will say the
frontal did not come SuperDuper plug
like this girl right or a whole bunch a
about in this lace
I'll just smash it but again that's the
thing about customizing your frontals
and stuff like that to make it look like
you want them to look so that you can
now get clock the house when you are out
you know Richard Lux I really like him
but you know when you go out you don't
want people to be like you got a wig on
you know so you want it to look as
natural as you can in the front and my
hairline normally looks like this so you
know why not now as far as the actual
hair goes when I got it it was very
silky and it was nice so I went ahead
and I didn't even co-wash it because I
was a little scared that the color was
gonna run so I said let me wear first
didn't wanna you know once I go ahead
and just once I go ahead and just mess
up you know my whole hairline when I was
glue and his team then I have to wash it
here anyway so once I washed it I did
notice that it was much more manageable
for me personally and I initially did it
because I did go ahead and put some of
that good good
encouraging smoothing conditioner from
magic hair company in it and now it's
nice and soft and silky and voluminous
like that okay I feel like Eva Marie
from total divas like that's what I'm
getting from it I like this a lot though
like I like this color on my skin a
whole lot so I noticed that when I first
got it it may have been a little bit dry
it was still very silky but again you
know back here girl that the kitchen fro
back there it gets very staticky that's
what I was trying to have the most of
the hang-ups with but after I use that
hair change smoothing shampoo and the
conditioner girl put the links down
below because I'm seriously I don't get
no money from it unfortunately but it's
Bob I noticed that the hair is much more
softer I don't have that issue back here
anymore so I would say because the hair
doesn't bleed let's just keep that clear
the hair at least vonti it did not bleed
once I got it and usually red is one of
those colors that bleed a whole freaking
lot it didn't bleed it off which I was
shocked I'm like this water is not even
like a lightning get party a pastel girl
Easter none of that it was real
so again I will I will give them that
that and then the hair didn't smell like
color
okay now I've done right here before in
the hair it smell like whatever they use
to make it that color this don't smell
like that okay so I'm assuming that what
they did was they didn't take no 613
here and it just slapped some color on
it and they just fish telling it it
seems like this color from based on what
I've done and usually okay backs on
point is on the all B's giving around so
yeah it doesn't seem like this is any
like cellophane here this is real-life
actual dyed processed hair now I will
say also when people process 6:13 hair
if you guys will know if you guys ever
done this when you start to flat iron
your hair you will start to get in fact
the heat will start to make creases in
the hair which is super ugly
okay just girl we know it's the other
thing we know that's the Manic Panic
boot so this now you guys know I usually
like to do at least two colors and I
don't mean like two colors I mean like a
red and a red I would have personally
did our darker red here at the bottom
for me personally just you know just to
make it look a little bit more
dimensional but you know I feel like
somebody's baby mama I'm at the game
with the kids we just had a baby so you
know I can't show my stomach because I'm
still recovering from the baby weight
but I'm still here and he's gay cuz I
got my jewels on my diamonds he locked
down and it's only two side chicks at
this point so we live in you know I'm
saying I'm good I got a new hair color

game like all that that's what I'm
feeling right now

y'all's on those shout outs this next
year I love this red color I personally
would like to try in my opinion I would
like to try some different colors
because
again I really would like hold on oh
this burgundy sexy hair I want that and
then I would like to try this brown
color up here in the body way okay so
yeah I know one more thing that I want
to mention before I go is that holding a
curl it's more of a body wave than a
curl that's why I didn't curl it in I
left it where it is this hair is more
suitable for it being straight because
it is processed to be such a thing it's
better off in its original state
I personally unless you did some
heatless curls on it I find like those
lasts a little bit longer than he curls
on here like this so you did like some
physical girls or they take a really
small you know one it'll hold but it's
not gonna hold for everything I got here
that girl until I wash it them crows
won't come out this is not necessarily
that hair it's more suitable for pretty
much what it is at the moment so if you
