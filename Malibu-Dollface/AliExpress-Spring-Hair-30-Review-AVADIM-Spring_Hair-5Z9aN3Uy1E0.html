Aliexpress a lot of you guys want to
know what it looks like an inside after
I make them this is what it looks like
this is my silk top unit from a closure
store and the masane closure is always
wear so pretty much you put a
pre-existing part in your hair and then
you line that up with your closure so
that it looks like they pretty much snap
and connect together you can make your
part as smaller as thick as you want it
depending on how your hair is but I just
use concealer and a pencil if my part
looks a little too wide sometimes and I
have a widow's peak so it tends to work
with the behind a hairline thing so you
pretty much just adjusted to your liking
I could have pulled it forward just a
little bit more but yeah and then I
tried to accompany with a scarf to try
something different so baby boy I like
it my way in my have such as bad
okay so this is going to be a review for
this hair that I'm wearing which is the
Aliexpress brand I did like an initial
kind of show-and-tell
review for this spring hair now in that
review I did say that I was going to
color this hair blue black and I'm sure
you can see this hair is not blue black
has nothing to do with me and all to do
with the company so we'll get into that
in just a second I currently have four
bundles of 30 inches so this is how long
it is so I told you guys usually a 30
hits my weight no a 24 hits my waist so
30 comes to my hip um it's pretty long
but it's not very thick usually when I
have virgin hair and we'll get into that
in a second too usually when I have
virgin hair the wefts and the amount of
hair that's on the web some is very full
this hair however was not full these
bundles were as you can see in the
initial video that I did the bundles
were very thin not crazy thin but
thinner than they should have been um I
currently have a suit based closure in
from closure store I decided to put my
this is my will represent this is my
Versace H&amp;amp;M scarf so that's why has the
crocodile's on it they go with my pants
um but I decided to do something just a
little bit different so it's just not
you know straight down cuz this kind of
looks like a wig that I have from a
company which was going to be my point
to do I'm like I want to do the middle
part I'm gonna try with some L Express
hair I'm gonna do a blue black I'm gonna
you know then do something different
because recently a fellow youtuber of
mind named muffins since my lover's 2012
which is April she was doing some
Aliexpress reviews of
and she said that she wants to go Co her
hair when she D colored it blonde she
used bleach the hair started to smoke
and she did a video to prove that it was
smoking then it charred the hair and
that usually comes because the hair is a
blend so pretty much it will be 50%
human hair and 50% synthetic hair that's
for - or fibers and because it can be
heated up to 450 degrees when you
Flatiron it is a melt
but color or anything of that nature on
it it will melt so I heard this a lot
with Aliexpress companies and our you
know just to kind of be foolproof and
see if it's true or by experience any of
that is why I wanted to try it however I
was not given that opportunity because
the company is um so they want to rush
me very much about this review so it's
not really much honestly that I'm going
to be able to say it um in his review
because I haven't had enough time with
his hair you guys know that this month
of May I am doing a video a day in May
so my upload schedule for hair reviews
are not as often as they usually are
because there are so there's so much
other stuff that I'm doing which I've
explained and I've let them know we're
pretty much it was met with we really
don't care
we need our video up now that's pretty
much what it that's the gist of it so
again I dub with this kind of customer
service before with another Aliexpress
company that I've um I've dealt with so
um you know again customer service is
also very important when it comes to
hair companies or any company for that
matter so these four bundles that I have
in they shed it quite a bit when I put
them in and this time I did not cut my
webs because I wanted to see how the
hair was going to act um if any shedding
was involved um this is the amount of
hair that I've gotten from this hair
after I've gotten a lot more as I was
putting it in um which I don't really
like and then also this hair has a lot
of gray hairs in it which grey hairs
have you know about virgin hair they use
them to fill the hair in so it doesn't
look so sparse instead of using more
virgin hair they use gray hair you can't
really tell on camera but when I was
putting them in like most of the bundles
had like a nice section of gray hair in
it um again I wanted to lift this hair
because again this review is going to be
nothing but for me to do another
Brazilian straight hair that I've done
once before I wanted to do something
different but if clearly the company
just feels as if they need to review up
to be you know just now and it can't say
anything really bad about the hair one
because I haven't had enough time to
deal with the hair but to
far so good but the shedding is one
thing that I'm experiencing a lot of
which is not really a good time when you
first put hair and his hair hasn't yet
to be Co wash is yet to be washed at all
so usually when water hits it it's a
whole different story
um I don't necessarily think that this
hair is 100% virgin is the thing here's
the issue that I'm starting to have
without expressed companies and the
reason why I do reviews like this is
because for the people who cannot afford
the very expensive hair this is another
alternative and don't get me wrong there
are vendors on Aliexpress who have nice
hair but this particular vendor I'm not
too sure about because of the origins in
which I mean you see how it keeps doing
this in the back it keeps kind of like
one in a buckle and not steak bone
straight it's not supposed to do that
like hair virgin hair is not supposed to
do that wherever you put it is where
it's supposed to say and it just kind of
all over the place so I'm going to take
this off so y'all can see this hair
without a headband one so this is what
it looks like with no head bent or
anything on it it's not bad it's not
horrible by a long shot but see I don't
know this is hair that hasn't been
washed I've just been kind of wearing it
out you know I'm saying just kind of get
a feel for it but it's not really hmm
it's not bad at all you know saying like
it's bad but all here usually is good
when you have it straight off the pack
is that what is it gonna do once you
know a co-wash hits it but and that was
going to be my test when I put the color
in it to see how well it took the color
and how how well it held up after I blow
dried it and all that good stuff but
again there has nothing to do with me
and all to do with the company they want
their hair and they want it now because
they don't understand that other people
have schedules as well so yeah um that's
the problem as much as I can say as far
as this hair is concerned will I come
back with the update from this hair most
likely not um because I don't really see
a point so I might end up just
repurposing the cap and the closure
people need to understand especially
about as hair reviewers you can't send
me hair on a Monday
and expect your review next Monday one
because I haven't had enough time to
deal with the hair - you're not the only
person that I'm reviewing for and three
I also have a life as well so therefore
if I tell you like you know
unfortunately I can't get your review up
right away because I have other things
that I have to do then your best bet is
to respect what we're saying and then
just wait your turn
that's it because you end up with
reviews like this word they're really
not a review I'm just kind of ranting
about how the company is not really
professional about in which way they do
it you guys know I review for a lot of
companies there's a lot of companies
that have a ton away and I say no - I'm
doing these Aliexpress reviews because
I'm trying to find the most the diamond
in the rough what company has the good
hair at a low price that has thick
bundles because yeah this hair looks
nice it's for the average person this
hair is enough what I put a curl to this
no um because if I try to cut it I'll
have to cut about this much off so to
pretty much cut this so that leaves me
with this then you curl this this is
what your curls are going to look like
that's not attractive you see what I'm
saying so it's not enough hair to give
you this big luminous curls you're not
going to get that so if you want some
straight hair that just happens to be
really long then I would say go for it
sure this bun these four pieces together
I think are very affordable now what's
going to happen after you wash your hair
or you wrap your hair I have no clue so
yeah um this is my spring hair I'll
review and I had high hopes for this
hair and I really wanted to do something
different with this hair that I haven't
did with my other ones I was going to do
a tutorial on how I did my hair the
color um but no I'll save that for
another company so yeah I'll talk to
y'all later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
