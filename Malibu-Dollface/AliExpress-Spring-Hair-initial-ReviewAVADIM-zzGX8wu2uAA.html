Aliexpress this was the little pamphlet
flyer I guess you could say they sing
with all their information listed on it
they send me four bundles of 30-inch so
these are the bundles they're nice
they're nicely constructed bundles the
hair is soft it smells nice this is
they're all thirty again I'm gonna make
this hair blue-black so it's gonna dye
it first and I think I'm gonna dye them
of course all separately but the hair
itself it seems nice but usually to test
some of this hair out cuz I always just
wear it natural I'm gonna actually put
some color in it to see if I actually
like it when it's blue-black I want to
try something a little bit different
than just regular old Brown so you can
see this has like a natural brown hue to
it they say that it's virgin so I'm
gonna you know take their word for it
but once I put the color on it it'll let
me know if it's really virgin but the
wefts are great so make sure that you
guys stay tuned for my review for this
particular hair and I will talk to you
guys in the next month buttburn</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
