video and I did not rerecord it because
I didn't know and between the intro and
this and all of this hair I was not
gonna rerecord this so enjoy you know it
happens to the best of us
Thanks alright so it's a lot going on
here I don't know how my intro is gonna
look like because it I can't do anything
with his hair like physically move what
I don't happen to brush it like that's
what we get with it so so I know I tease
this hair like um like two months ago
this is one of reason why I don't like
the tease or talk about something until
it's out because you have people in your
comments all day asking about the same
thing and it's like if it's not ready
yet then it's not ready yet if something
will all be in a snow globe yeah like I
don't know what else to tell you
okay so this is my hair from Ali pearl
this is my 60 inch hair I believe this
is the longest hair review like
lengthwise on YouTube I don't know and I
have to keep brushing and keeping an eye
on it in that whole thing okay and my
part is crooked it's like askew off from
the middle but the problem that I've
been having the most with this is
because my hair is so heavy
none of my floratape wants to say is
just everything just keeps pulling back
okay it's gravity is Tammy up right now
most you guys may have known that I wore
this hair for Halloween cuz I was
dear Marmee and you know her birth her
hair goes over to her ankles and yeah it
was easier to during that time because I
had a had been on so heaven was actually
helped me secure my hair my hair is not
take down I blew down all the way around
just because it's no point I'm not about
to wear this hair all day it's like it's
cold but it's like this is a lot this is
a lot of hair so for a human to wear
like I see why Barbie you know if it was
my real hair it would be a little bit
different because it would have been a
little bit easier to tame but because it
is so straight and it is so long girl
I have not tripped over it though I will
say that as long as it is I have not
dealt with me tripping over it I cut it
just like I snipped it just a little bit
so that it can come right right above
and meet walking in Hills a flat footed
I'm definitely hitting the floor with
heels on like so like 120 millimeter
Louboutins I'm clear okay I just have to
make sure that I walk without anybody
around cause it could be a complete
issue and problem so my front tool in a
40 inch 13 my 6 frontal um I know like
this one girl who was bald-headed and
Hills like why is there a big step
between your hair there's a 20 inch gap
between my frontal so my frontal would
be this long okay so my front was this
long and then my hair my hair gets into
the chair so my frontal stops here as
you can see and then the rest of this
this 20 inch gap so remember when I did
my other hair that's 40 inches and I was
like I wish I had a 13 by six fronts
also go with it okay this fronts will be
perfect but because it is 60 inches and
it is a gap when I do walk you can tell
there's a behind me you can definitely
tell it should be some video up in here
when I wore it it's not as dramatic as
it looks on camera is really not but it
there is a difference you know there's a
difference when you do look
but if it's like this like during that
time I had it all pushed back so you can
tell but when it's actually just kind of
cloaked over my body you can't really
tell that there's a big difference it
looks like somebody well layers it's
just extremely long that's the thing I
have in eight bundles of 60-inch which
they send me five and after they send me
five I was like that's not enough air
like my hair's gonna extremely thing
thin because it's so long because you
guys know hair is usually measured by
the weight so the longer the hair is the
more it's gonna weigh because it's more
hair but then it means your wife gets
shorter so they had to like give me more
that it's like super send me more
bundles like out of nowhere but it was
like because there's pros and cons about
this like I couldn't wear this hair and
I have not worried this area every day I
cannot it's not humanly possible and
less I wore them braids or something
like this but this is definitely photo
shoot hair this is hair you know to look
cute to make a moment I did however wear
it on Halloween and I was a little bit
easier because I told you I had a
headband with these so that whole thing
worked it out but as far as everyday use
this is very difficult now if this hair
was like I've seen some people on you to
do it like Nicki Minaj hair and
synthetic oh girl I would die I would
die a million deaths cuz this is human
and I'm going crazy so synthetic is not
an option synthetic gets to like so not
an option so I don't know now I believe
that a lot of you guys had contacted
them once I posted this on Instagram and
acting like will they have this hair in
stock form I understand and they will
not it just really was made for me or
whatever but they just wanted to show
how like great they're straight here is
and I do love their friend here you guys
know I reviewed this right here matter
of fact with the middle part before this
but they was like we have like the
longest here and they know how II have
40 so I was like okay so I went from 34
to 40 or 60 so honey inches is what I'm
looking at next oh I'm not doing it
anybody come to me with that don't cuz I
count I'm at my wit's end okay so this
is what it looks like
just flowy and moving by itself I put
some of my beyond the zone heat
protectant spray because that gives it
some nice you know oil earnestness
Nastase for those who are gonna ask my
top
my situation is from the mosquito I
forgot wood mosquito collection it's was
below Kim mortis so I had to get it
because obviously I was doing a little
Kim song and yeah like it's cute it's
beautiful hair like you hear what I'm
saying like this beautiful hair but my
only issue and problem with this is I
can't wear it everything it's too much
air I never thought that I personally
would say that I never thought that I
will personally say that but this is a
lot of hair guys like it's full as hell
like it don't look that way but it's so
heavy it's not even funny
so I'm sure you're asking would you
recommend this hair the hair itself yes
the length no unless you like I said
unless you plan to do like a fantasy
ponytail or something like that or you
plan to do a runway show of some sorts
and you need some SuperDuper long hair
but this is very difficult to wear on a
regular basis and y'all know I can whip
it my 40 inch I had no problems with
Bogardus extra 20 inches just killed my
whole so and I'm sure to I'm 5 foot 4 so
it literally comes to the floor bare
flesh okay so it's safe to say I'm not
sixty inches okay um but as far as the
hair go up as many times as I have to
brush this I haven't had any shedding
issues which I was super shocked by
because I just knew it was about to be
here a book re where and it was not so
I'll given them that give them that my
frontal itself is a 13-6 which I told
them they had a custom make for me
because they didn't have it so like I
said in my previous reviews for
companies it's about to be 2018 there's
no reason why we cannot have no
team by six front tools readily
available now in 40 inches I think they
should be available because again I
personally am gonna use this front so
for my 14 chair because you know all
even in one I was young and y'all know I
hate the gap young no I hate the gap but
again the hair itself is it's great it's
just that it's just way too long I'm too
short for this if I was an eye only
combos high if I was six foot one I
probably could be able to deal with this
a little bit better but I cannot because
I'm too short for this okay I kind of
definitely I think 50 would have been my
cat there's extra ten inches actually 20
inches gonna killing me but there's an
injured I've been just really did it
because again you have to keep combing
through it you have to keep cuz hair
itself naturally is going to want to
fling and go from side side to side to
side so you have to keep like a tame
because if not you end up with a big
ball so you're gonna have this straight
and then you're gonna have a messy ball
at the end but luckily as you can see
it's gonna stay see when you pull one
side you gotta make see I'm telling you
it's just it's a lot a lot usually what
happens is when I'm coming through it I
have to usually grab it here and then
comb through it like this in order to
wear it and then I can go here from here
so you know you supposed to go from the
end down and usually I'll be good and
then I have to do the same over here
luckily it's full enough where my hair
doesn't look like I have gaps in it but
it's not so full where I can't go
through it so there you go so again like
I said if you're just looking to be
extra I would hit them up and ask them
cuz I'm sure they can custom do it for
you but I don't think this is just gonna
be readily available okay it's Merry
Christmas
some of y'all pushing it but again
everybody give them a rating I would
give them a 9 and a half and the only
reason why they don't get
other half for me is because I had to
ask for more bundles and that's because
it wasn't full enough I don't know why
he thought I was gonna be enough but it
wasn't but overall I had a great
correspondence with the company I do
plan to wear this hair more I probably I
mean I will say this it's really good
hair for what it is I did try to bleach
it and that was a no-go for me I would
not I mean I was about to bleach all
this hair anyway I don't know why some
of y'all were like oh she would've did
it blonde like Barbies know cuz Barbie's
never help me use 80 tubs
of developer and bleach to do no we're
not doing that but even when I did it
though it's just I just wouldn't do it I
just I would keep it this color it's I
felt I find like their hair is best when
it's kept in its original state I'll
turn it any I personally wouldn't do it
just for me you know them so again
notice a lot of rambling going on it was
not lots of show because literally I'm
just sitting here when I'm out on the
hair but I hope you guys did enjoy this
and and I'm hot to burning up that was
not girls awareness and Betty
like I don't girl please but the hair
also is probably nice full and it's
probably not as heavy either so again
this is from Ally pearl I have in eight
bundles of 60 inch and I have eight
thirteen by six a lace frontal in that
was a little bit on the pre pluck side
and there should have been pictures up
in here kind of close-ups and stuff like
that they want to get close-up because
my way keeps moving oh so yeah I hope
you guys like this and I'll catch you
guys in my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
