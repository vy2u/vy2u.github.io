at the color
hey 50 color okay so I'm here to review
for steamer hair this is their Brazilian
body wave ombre that I have nicely dyed
purple and straighten and I am rocking a
4 by 13 lace a frontal that I personally
bleached to myself to match my bundles
oh um originally this hair was I'll put
a picture here it was originally this
color which is like a light brown like a
like a medium brown color and they
pretty much was like what what you know
what are you planning to do with it are
you gonna wear it in natural state and I
was like well I was going to keep it
like it was and then I'm just going to
go ahead and bleach the frontal because
I didn't have a matching frontal to
match it and that was it then I had to
struggle genius like oh let's do purple
you guys know I am NOT a big fan of
purple by a long shot so it would be no
secret that I would not want purple hair
by a long shot so I was talking to my
little sister who's currently in New
York and she was saying how she really
wanted some purple hair and she's like
you know is it possible that you can do
me some purple hair and you know because
I want some color her favorite color is
purple so I was like I'll see what I can
do and this was the outcome so they just
seemed darker there are much darker
purple than my frontal is I wanted the
frontal to be a little more of the star
versus the sidekick because it's in the
front and stuff on tulle so I wanted it
to be more of a bolder color mixed with
a darker color so you probably can't
tell on camera because this just looks
Brown but all of this is purple this
just happens to be a lot of purple but
this is actually purple too so the ombre
I think I believe started probably about
here and it went down so I used
this add or color and 116 purple rage
this was the color that I use and it
actually does match my hair
I personally bleached my front tool I'll
lighter because I wanted the purple to
show a little bit more at the top versus
at the bottom so since I've been in such
a color mood these are all the colors
that I've used this is my blue and my
Purple's that I've these are empty but
this one actually has some color left in
it so I used this color on all of my
bundles because of course I wanted it to
be all even yet I wanted to have more of
the arm more of a I wanted to be an
ombre but this be again like I said
before this centerpiece of it so to my
bundles I'm currently rocking 4 bundles
and of course my frontal I believe my
frontal is 16 inches and I believe that
all my bundles are 20 inches so I think
I have 4 20s and a 16 inch of frontal I
did not cut this hair whatsoever so this
what you're saying seeing here is how he
came so this is the way in which you
came I'm really mad that my hair is
looking black on camera because it's
really not it's really all purple at the
bottom mmm so far as long as I've had
the bundles I'm so far so good I haven't
had any major shedding the frontal took
very well to color and it originally I
was going to do my my hair all um I was
going to keep it all the color at the
bottom was the original ombre which I
showed you here once before I was going
to keep it that color but what I decided
to do because the hair was lifting so
quickly I decided to let it go a little
bit lighter than um the original color
was the original blond or brown and I
wanted it to stay on a little bit longer
so you can see it because I was afraid
after I did it I put color on it just
like ash Renta's and I turned this light
on the seat and it was as dark as the
bottom is and the sides are and I'm like
damn I
so you can see the color so I went back
and went over it put another application
of bleach and I use this BW to bleach
and I use this Claire or any volume
developer now I will say that I did not
you see how flowy my frontal wall my
hair's fluid but um this hair I was up
this hair obvious was bleached because
the natural color is obviously not
armory of course this hair was bleached
and I bleached it again
it was a regular 1b when I received it I
believe it up to here um all it still
flows it's not dried out what I did you
Tresemme rich moisture which I use all
the time when I bleach here because this
locks the moisture back into the hair
after you color it um I tend to co wash
sometimes with this too is depend on
what's the closest but if it's something
you know okay I like to use this a lot
with my curly hair um well most on my
way to here I usually use something else
from our curly hair but this I use a lot
it does lock the moisture back in it's
very inexpensive but it definitely works
so this is again the Tresemme moisture
rich luxury moisturizer so once I ended
up uh rinsing all the color out now
I did however leave my color and for
about four days not because I wanted to
but because I had so much other stuff
that was going on I literally let it sit
until the color literally crust it onto
my hair and dried up which tends to help
thing that I love about our doors colors
and they're very pigmented and after a
while of leaving them on the hair you're
going to notice like some people that
when do you know when it's done or when
you know that it's ready
usually with adorn colors they have for
whatever reason when you put it on the
hair you can see the color when it's
done and you can rinse it out as usually
looks like you have a little shampoo so
it looks starts to look clear and that's
kind of like your indication like okay I
can go ahead and rinse it down the
longer that you keep it on
of course the more pigment that your
hair is going to look when all is said
and done if you do not want a very um
like let's just say I got this up
and I didn't wanted this purple what I
would have done is took some white
conditioner like that Tresemme
conditioner and put it in a Tim bowl and
then put some color and mixed it I could
have made like a lilac esque
color out of this if I wanted to um so
that's kind of a trick to if you just
really am NOT happy um or or if you're
one of those people who after you bleach
your hair and you just kind of scared
this going to be dry you can mix your
color with conditioner and then that'll
help also bring life back to the hair
too especially is curly it'll definitely
help bring the life back I've received
um a minimal amount of shedding with
this hair it hasn't been crazy it hasn't
been nothing again that is just I can't
deal with every now and then I'll get a
strand here there but as you can see my
hair is very very very full it's not
thin by a long shot it actually has a
lot of luster to it it moves like it's
supposed to
I love the color variation that's in
this as you can see and you again I'm
not a person for purple hair I'm just
I'm not a person for purple period but a
lot of you guys every time you come you
guys always suggest you should do purple
you should do purple you're gonna do
purple all purple will be so cute you
know I'm saying shout out to all my hood
girls who love a good purple and all my
hood girls who love the good blue and I
did that too I feel you but other than
that I have had a very very positive
experience with this hair now I will say
when I originally got it it was a body
wave of course the S shape and I noticed
that when I brushed that shape out and I
flat ironed my hair
it should take a nice little couple of
passes in order for it to get this
straight and stay this straight my
frontal I believe was a body wave as
well so it was actually very easy
especially after I bleached it to go
ahead
and um straighten it out I did go ahead
and bleach my frontal uh because it does
go to ear to ear and I I figured
something out actually after doing this
I find it much easier to pluck the hair
line of a frontal after you bleach the
knots I feel like when I do it before I
bleach the knots it's like I'm tearing
the hair out and it doesn't want to come
out as easily but when I simply do it
after it's bleach the hair seems like
it's a little more relaxed of its softer
so it's easier for me to pluck out and
it saves me a fortune so when I do my
tutorial which if y'all keep asking me
it's gonna get long and longer y'all
please I got like everything is going on
just search the term I'm sure I'm not
the only one that's done a tutorial on
this um before I do so when it's like
straight from the factory and I've only
given it a co-wash now this is a picture
of what it looked like and not like a
half-up half-down ponytail and you guys
can see kind of more here because mine
is behind my hairline but I have but I
like to leave because the way my
hairline is made I can't keep like I
can't put it right on my it just don't
work for me but this is what it looked
like after I bleached it put it up and
pluck the hairline this is what it
looked like
versus the very edged up look that they
come so if you guys are interested in
this um rye wine this video and take the
proper precautions all the products that
I use for this I will put below all the
colors that I use which is only one I'll
put below as well and um yeah shout out
to see my hair I think that they're very
good company it's one of my favorite
companies that's gonna be featured in my
good ol Aliexpress top video I mean top
companies that I really like because I
feel like it was actually very well
treated hair it wasn't dry it had a
nitrile natural luster to it
it's just that what I tried to
straighten it and it wasn't so prone to
want to be straight it took a minute for
me to get this sleepless and I was going
to originally curly but I feel like you
wouldn't be able to see the color as
much so I just decided to get it but if
you're interested make sure you guys hit
the links
lo and I will catch on in my next piece
uh look at that color yellow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
