everybody loves anime okay I'm sure you
can tell by my face I'm not really happy
that's cuz I'm not okay so one side of
my hair is wet the other side is not
yeah okay so this hair that I have is
from me seen but it's not really that
amazing okay so this is their loose wave
and you guys know I just reviewed lose
weight not too long ago and I was
totally obsessed with that hair which I
still AM and I tried these same
techniques on that hair and it did not
do this so this is what it looks like
one side of it wet and one side of a
draw oh the problem that I'm having with
this hair and I've had since I've had it
is that I can't find a style for this
hair at all and the reason is is to
straight at the top and it is too curly
at the bottom so in this state yeah I
could probably get away with this and
this would be fun which I'm gonna go and
wet this eye too so that you guys can
see what it looks like all together but
if you curious to know what it look like
before our wedding just look at my other
video it's the same difference as far as
um the way that the actual hair looks
it's just big and fluffy when you air
dry it like this but then when you put
water on it then it does this again only
pull out a little bit of Crow cream in
it just a little bit just because I
didn't want it to look flat it did
something but not much I'm gonna go and
wet this eye and then I'm gonna come
back and then we can't really talk okay
so this is what it looks like completely
away from the root back and this
honestly is some of the most problematic
hair that I've had um I don't I feel
like what
look that I was going for I felt like I
was gonna do like something like
Beetlejuice related I look like one
extra in the Butte juice cartoon but
yeah I just I'm not a fan of this hair
it's just like crazy like there is my
sink has I don't know how much hair in
it right now okay
and this is one of those the hair where
when you wet it it sheds really bad and
when it's dry it really bad yeah
it's like it looks great like as far as
this goes it looks great but I'm not a
fan like at all like this is because in
order for see um in order for me to keep
this looking like this and at least
tamed enough I have to make sure let's
hear my shedding I have to make sure
that um
that's what because dry is it's
literally like going through a mop or a
bush and I'm just writing through regen
to regen through trying to make this
fetch happen in the fetch is not
happening usually with amazing hair I
have amazing time and I'm feeling very
very sad right now about this when I
first got my hair lo I was like okay so
this is probably gonna be very similar
to my other hair I'll be cool when I
wash it and conditioned it I was good
but I hadn't installed the check so this
washing condition was just based on each
individual where when you started
putting in all the bundles together and
then you put them in the elements in bus
one of these then you gonna end up with
that and that's not a lot just imagine
what you ain't seen I just I'm so sad
because I wanted this to be nice and I'm
so not for this leg and I don't like
when my hair is wet quite frankly I
really don't but this is the only thing
I could do because if I try to wear it
like dry oh it would have started a
forest fire up in here so let me get to
the frontal then at least something good
came for
is the frontal I believe looks very very
natural it looks very good I kind of saw
a little blonde right there because I
kind of over bleached but my frontal
this is about the best part of this
whole situation
I'm reported so you could see so this is
what it looks like when I'm parting it
let's see you can purge it here and see
the parting looks great you know and
from my understanding my frontal isn't
shedding um but I don't know for a fact
if it's not when I did I did notice
something though when I did bleach this
when I first took it out the package
because I bleached the knots on it it
kind of had though you know you get like
a three-part closure so it's like a part
of heart apart so when every time you
put water on it just parts and that
that's kind of what this has which I
don't like okay so we'll do this I don't
think this is gonna do anything that
helped it now my hair now look like the
Undertaker it's just doesn't look
because it's so straight at the root
that's what I hate is that is straight
so the other thing I can do is wear this
kind of just a flip over and out the way
because yeah that's that's this but I
really can't say much because I'm just
so disappointed and I've been trying to
really wait with this hair I have
because I was hoping that eventually
that this is gonna stop but this don't
look like it stopping no time soon it
would be perfect if I was shooting
something in a pool and I needed to get
out looking like everything then this
would be great because it looks great
while it's wet but it's just not my
favorite Wow it's the wedding on me you
know like if I'm not I couldn't go
through the day with this like this
would be very rough for me to go through
the day with and when I was wearing it I
was wearing it dry I wasn't wearing it
wet because I had a sneaking suspicion
this was going to be it now I wore it
one time way and because it was so hot
during that time my hair dry really
quick so I didn't really experience what
I'm experienced now the air has been on
pretty much all day so it's quite cool
where I am I'm soon but tame like this
just sucks
because this is some really like the
idea of it is nice the idea of it is
nice but the execution my dear
not so much um this will be great for
like if this was a 360 I could put this
in a ponytail and if all of this was
just hanging I would be fine if I could
just bust a nice pump but I don't like
this I'm legit just don't like this hair
and is so many things that are wrong
with it it's the texture change that
your tiny change is crazy because though
using how big this hair was it could
have it at least a little bit more
weighted in this because this is very
similar to mod like body wave like I
feel like this is just what bodyweight
looks like when its way um
I what I curled it when I wore it a big
Ike wrote the top because it didn't
match so curling the top is fine or
whatever but it's definitely not a
selling point for me like I just think
that that's just a lot that you have to
do when you get some hair that has
texture to it the only time I like to
curl hair at any point is that when my
hair is straight so cuz I can uniform
the curl and do what I wanted to do with
this I'm gonna give this a 3 out of 10
because at least the frontal isn't
shedding the frontal bleach very well
and the texture is nice but everything
else
mmm so amazing here I'm gonna need you
to do some reinforcement on this puppy
on this because I'm just not a fan sorry
I'm just
I mean I hate to it wasn't as bad I just
had some hair recently that I had that I
had to send back because it was
SuperDuper bad and it wasn't that bad
and I was trying to give it a chance
sometimes you got to do you have to give
hair as person from Aliexpress you have
to give hair a little bit of a chance
before you say you just really hate it
and I've had these bundles for at least
two months at least two months the wig
is they're made for at least a month and
a half and I've worn at least four times
and every time I pull this one out
because I've mistaken it for my other
body wave the one where I had the one
braid with the orange on and I'm I was
like was my hair shedding like this and
I'm thinking I'm like just the wrong wig
and of course it was so anyway let me
know what you guys think below you know
I'm more it is immuno intro hi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
