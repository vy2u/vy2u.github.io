with an update for the hair that I'm
rocking right now in the same outfit in
the same background that I had when I
originally reviewed this hair but
remember when I told you guys I was like
I can't find any of my tools I couldn't
find my lawn I didn't find anything
because I just moved here so this is the
hair so far like since I've had it and
I'll give you guys what my final
thoughts about it so this is their loose
waves that they sent and this is still
what it was when I first received it I
haven't put much product in and I put a
like a little bit of Flatiron spray in
it just for the top area and then I used
my curlers I didn't even eat the wand
but I use the curlers to do the top it's
not really too much it just it has still
have that natural feel to it as you can
see and this is for somebody who's not
really humorous and girl in anything um
so what I did was I went ahead and cut
the banker which I should cut some more
I haven't cutted since I originally put
it in I just been kind of wearing it
like this cuz it's really fluffy and
it's very natural
at the time my closure was just entirely
too straight it's the same closure that
I had in which is my silk waist closure
from closure store and yeah I mean it's
not really much that I can say uh based
off the fact that you guys know how I am
I'll start wearing some hair I'll stop
wearing it and I'll put it back on and
then whenever I'm feeling a certain way
then I'll plop whatever way I feel like
that's the great things about wigs and
then you can put them on and you can
take them off you don't have to be stuck
with the same style forever cuz this is
the wig down who I always put away when
I like going out for like an errand or I
just pretty much go they take Zanotti
for her for her appointments this is the
wig that I like to run
because it's very free-flowing it's very
easy it's not super long because it's
super hot but you know I can kind of
give it a little bit of cuteness and it
still gives me natural look without me
looking a little too done up if that
makes any sense but yeah so this hair is
my again my amazing hair from Aliexpress
that's the company's car the company is
called amazing hair and it is 222 and 2
2016 inch Subway's closure from closure
store so this is the hair after two
months and I've washed it I did not I
put a wrench on it I didn't put no like
major color and it like pop of color so
when it's against this black crop top I
don't look brown and black you look
black and black but my main issue that I
had with this hair is definitely the
shedding the shedding of his hair is
ridiculous in mind you I did not cut my
left at all I just folded them over so
there really should be no shedding from
you know the snipping of webs or
anything and it's ridiculous job so
that's the one thing that I don't like
about this hair but it's a lot I'm not
gonna wanna it is a lot and that's why
this is kind of like my Aran hair
because it stays like this I don't
really do much else to it but what it's
this which is this natural look so after
two months and consistent wear is it's
cool it's fine for the price is cool but
I'm just not in love with it you know
like it's cool or whatever this is a
good these are good tracks when you just
want to sew something in like a wig or
something but maybe it's just my bundles
that I got if anybody else's they got in
his hair have you had these same issues
with shedding like I have because it's a
lot and I don't I so anyway um I hope
you guys did enjoy this make sure you
guys check them out if you're looking
for some affordable hair see like that
snagging I'm not used to so and
it wasn't shedding really bad before him
when I first put it in but after a
little bit of while of where it starts
to get a little ridiculous so let me
know what you guys think and if you guys
have this same experience and or if not
negative or positive put them below
please and I will catch on in the next
one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
