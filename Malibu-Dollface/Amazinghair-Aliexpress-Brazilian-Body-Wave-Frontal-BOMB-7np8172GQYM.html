oh yeah yeah kill this kill it
it's gotta hit that Rihanna bitch it's
just hey okay so we're gonna talk about
my grow y'all this runs with all his
bronze up into this front so um it's
from amazing here and I think I've
worked with amazing here much before I'm
not mistaken I believe I did and this is
the second time a thing is it maybe the
second or third time but I'm almost
certain circuit I'm almost certain it is
the second time that I work with them so
this hair is the Brazilian a body way
you guys know I love a good body way
because it always gives me this nice
pretty amazing texture so what I did was
I went ahead and asked them for a
frontal because you guys know I'm trying
to get well-versed in front tools before
I do my tutorial all the way like it's
halfway done because I show you how to
make the leg but then out the frontal
part get still working on that I went
ahead and bleached the frontal so when I
receive the hair it had this nice body
wave texture to it and I took all of my
bundles and I co wash them and a lot of
people ask me about this about my like
curly hair or waiting here like what do
I do when I wash it so I won't mess up
the pattern you just simply keep it in a
pattern that s pattern that it's in keep
it in that and then when you wash you
just wash it rolled up within the bundle
if you take it apart then chances are
it's going to start looking a little
crazy and then it starts to look more
like a loose wave than a body wave what
I did was I took some kalida colors
color I used this color and i used this
Clairol for these 40 volume developer
and i use these to bleach the knots on
my frontal so that you can actually see
party because it's in this ponytail you
can tell we can tell at all cuz I don't
have a party but it actually made a one
of a difference we getting all those
black knots out of the roots and it made
my lace a little more
on the my skintone side instead of being
so light although my roots is real light
because you know I got the dry skin
problems of course all this will be
within my tutorial so you know what I
mean but I went ahead and did that and
then wash condition of my front school
then put it on and then install all of
my bundles I had this hair again this is
some hair that I've had for a while too
I think I got this here back in December
as well so it's been a minute since I've
had it and I loved it I went ahead and
plucked the frontal you know because I
wanted to make sure I look natural
because if it was like how it was when I
got it my hairline would not look like
this
it will look very edged up and very
crazy but my frontal is actually right
there yeah
it's right there and then the rest is my
hair around a perimeter so it looks like
my natural hairline that I usually wear
it doesn't look peculiar like
something's a little off because I have
like my edges right here come out much
trying to put a frontal on the correct
way which is right on the skin like
right here doesn't work because my
forehead is will be only oh it would end
up being right here so my forehead would
be only this and it's gonna look like
those pictures of Nicki Minaj like I
like her wig so much better now than
what she used to wear when she's the
where I'm a bleached blonde like 613 and
she would it would just look crazy like
nobody's hairline looks like the ending
was too thick but nobody's hair looks
like that and again the point of a
Front's with a point of a wig the point
of a weave is sports to look like yours
okay it looks like I have this nice
Spanish hair you know I'm saying that
just came from my scalp and I threw it
in a ponytail and I went about my day
most people cannot tell but you know you
know you're people so you know is in
front list is fly but I know that yours
but you know it's is that I have had a
little bit of shedding not crazy just a
little bit and I only got it for two
bundles all the bundles normal frontal
had I had any issues with the shedding
it was only my two top bundles that were
shedding a little bit and since then it
has definitely stopped all of my bundles
are 24 inches
which I love so it's 24 and it will come
tomorrow 24 comes to my way so this
definitely does go to my waist but
because it has a wave in it it looks a
little different it's of course
naturally a little bit shorter
this will take color and I want people
to know that watch these video they're
always actually oh can you die you can't
you diet if it says that it's 100% human
hair you can know you can dye it any
color you can bleach it you can lift it
you can deposit you can do whatever you
want with it I would always do um so
yeah go crazy with it do what you want
it is human hair especially if that's
what they're marketing it as then it's
human hair now if you bleach it and then
it fries on you or it melts then you got
a problem and then that's like you know
they're giving you some some BS okay I
usually do it I usually refrain from
saying this in my videos but we're gonna
just let the cat out the back I always
do a strand test on all my bundles every
last one of them I take some 14 valium
developer and I take whatever bleach I
have laying around and I'll take a
section of the bundle and I'll go ahead
and lead you if it does not turn a color
or it starts to smell the hair goes back
I've never had that issue except for one
time and the hair wasn't back not
because of that but because the hair
stunk so bad so I had a feeling that it
wasn't what they were saying it was and
I just didn't want to find out and then
except that I wasn't out you know I've
heard people hey I've seen people's hair
catch on fire you know sometimes so
that's what I do for all my bundles just
to see if it's going to turn or not you
know because if it's not 100% human hair
if you're going to know it's going to
start to act real funny when that
chemical hit it oh my god I really say
about this I love the pattern
I love the curl I didn't put any curve
cream in my front tool so my frontal is
a little more relaxed then my actual
bumbles are but I actually like that
look because I felt like they were too
uniform of before so I kind of went
ahead and pulled them apart
y'all not like this jacket off
you a girl from China $35 yes you can
give a real rich tease on a budget
yes I would keep this hair like this the
front ones not so big it is definitely
all lace I'll put some photo with some
footage of it so you see me part it and
see how it parts what it looks like when
it's not in a ponytail when it's just
all down so it's very similar to some
hair that I've had before because I was
also body weight and I believe it was
also Brazilian by the way but yeah I
like this I mean I just want to it's
just so good like you can see like if I
do this you can see the Scout part and
but it's actually some very very very
nice hair and I believe that the last
year that I had from them was actually
really nice too and their frontal was
very well made a just was that you have
to customize it that's that's the only
hang up with frontals you have to
customize them because they will not
look like this straight about that bag
it's not going to happen so if you have
any questions on what I did in please
guys I'm going to get to that frontal
tutorial I'm just trying to that's why
that timbers that glitter Chamberlin
trattoria ain't up here because I fell
into a few issues with that dude and
what I'm not trying to do is put
something up and then have people doing
it and then they're messing up their
stuff because of me I don't like to do
that so if I'm not 100% on it then it's
not going to go up until I know exactly
all the ins and outs of what I'm doing
to make it great I don't want to learn
which are because then if I fuck it up
all your own follow suit and then it's
gonna be a problem so when I do make
mistake I don't say it until I've
actually done it and know how to fix it
and so far so good I haven't had any
issues with my pencils or whatever but
I'm just trying to make sure that I can
get them as great as possible so I'm not
doing updated tutorial a bigger tutorial
a bit you know saying I don't want to go
through that I'm going to do it one good
time this year and then only have to
ablate update it
probably sometime next year so be
patient people I'm just trying to give
y'all a really great product and
greatness does take down it doesn't
happen overnight especially when you're
learning something new
learning people so I don't know
everything I'm clearly I'm on the right
path but I still want to perfect a semi
perfectionist took fall that's what
scream brings income earlier was both
stupid I was over there changing though
but if you have any questions about this
and you're interested in buying this
hair the just did you get those links
below and people always complain that I
never show the back of my wigs because I
just feel like I mean it's pretty
obvious what its gonna look like an
event like hair falling but if you live
you must be so funny so it just looks
very body wave ish back here that's
about it again all my wigs are made on a
cap and somebody asked me I want to see
you do a sewing I don't wear something
that's why I wear wigs cuz someone it's
too much teaching is too much work and
it's too much time and I don't like to
speak with my hair only my sheets so I
will catch all out and my next one great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
