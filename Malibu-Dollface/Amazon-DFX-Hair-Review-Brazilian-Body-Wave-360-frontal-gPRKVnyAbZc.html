I feel like legit like a beauty queen um
because my hair so like so large but
it's manageable and it's really soft and
I'm really in love right now so this
hair is from a Amazon store not only
expressed Amazon um which I quit Connor
with the same difference in my opinion
just whatever um so it's from Amazon for
my company are called EFX this is what
our bundles came in I am rocking their
Brazilian body wave which I'm sure you
guys probably guessed um judging by the
pattern that I have and I'm rocking 4
bundles of 22 inch as so this Toy Story
sweater that I really really so this Toy
Story a sweater that I am rocking like
such I just wanted to wear like some
really big hair and a very oversized
sweater is from forever 21 and it's from
their toy story collection that i'ma so
miss out I'm gonna assume that it's
alright now due to the simple fact that
it was a lot of these left when I and a
lot of just had like crop tops in one
pieces so yeah anyway tomorrow
rocking 4 bundles of their Brazilian
body wave but I am also rocking a 360 a
frontal that was not unfortunately given
by them to me but it's actually from how
beauty here each bundle is 100 grams
which normally people do not put up
especially more like Alex price um
Amazon they really don't put that many
grams so it's good to know that so that
means that if you are doing your hair by
gram joon-ha
you would need verses just kind of
guesstimating would you need for I have
four and I like how thick my hair is
however it is not heavy by a longshot
it's quite light and it could be because
you know I have the 360 on so maybe
that's why I doesn't feel as heavy
because usually I put a double the backs
but I singled all of these and I got
them to fit so three would probably be
the most for the average person if you
are dramatic like me then four to five
will definitely surprise for you just
depends on how you're feeling and their
bundles they carry from 8-inch which I
listed eight inch on me as a vein so
unless you plan on like making like a
27-piece and then cutting it okay but
they go from eight to thirty so they
pretty much will cover everything they
ain't got Foley they might give 40 but
they don't have 40 but 30 if you're
trying to be long even 28 is quite long
so they can definitely they're kind of a
one-stop shop and they carry everything
from deep way to straight all your usual
suspects they have when I receive my
bundles they were very soft there's
they're still very soft um I've had no
shedding at all with these aside from
the after I went ahead and cut my hair
and a little bit of a layer that was
only this the only thing that I received
from this my 360 front tool is um is
straight it's not wavy in the hair is
wavy so that's why I wanted to go ahead
and kind of mesh the two which I didn't
mind in this because see how this I just
put a little layer on the front and then
let this stay where it was so after I co
wash his hair I let it um
air dry I went ahead and did V I used to
air dry method and I went ahead and use
these which obviously not these but I
get these from Sally's and I just go
ahead and take four big sections after I
do the wig and put these back in and let
them dry around this so I can go back to
this so if you ever get hair and of
course when you receive body wave hair
when you take it out of that s pattern
then it's going to give you this pattern
but sometimes when you do wash wash it
what ends up happening is you end up
having to go back and
and now you have to cook like curly
curly owning our girl was the frontal
not the hair the hair is still in its
original state so it hasn't hit any heat
whatsoever 360 frontal goes of course
all the way around the back so if I
would if I wanted to I could take this
which I'm sure you can too I could take
this and put this in a ponytail if I
really wanted to because it goes all
this underneath here now I will say this
as far as the frontal goes it's really
nice and I don't mind it at all um as
opposed to the other one that our review
as far as this hair is concerned it's
really really nice hair for the price
that they're charging me for I feel like
this hair uh was it it reminds me of my
us-based bundles meaning it could be the
same vendor it couldn't be the same
vendor I don't know but the way that the
craftsmanship of the West were very
different for them used to usually
they're single wefted these were also
seeing elective but I think these were
machine wifted I don't think these were
hand tied because they they were a
little bit harder to get the needle
through which I prefer over hand tied
due to the simple fact that sometimes
with hand tied depending on who you're
getting it from you know a shedding
issue could become a really big problem
um the customer service with the company
was really nice they were very
understanding they were they understood
that I am quite busy and you know I told
them you know in a certain amount of
time but I also have to make sure that
the hair is something that I personally
can stand by and I really like before I
get on camera because a lot of times and
when I'm dealing with the company right
now is they want to send you the hair
and a week later they want to review
because they're scared that after a
month of you playing around and testing
the hair out that the hair is going to
go to the and they're going to kind of
be exposed for trying to do the
depression grab because usually what
happens is when you do companies and
their hair sucks and people start doing
videos at the hair set they just change
the logo they change the brand and I are
really speaking for like more of a
Aliexpress right they'll just change the
name of their company
and then have people review for that I
didn't say anything
so right now I'm going through that with
the company because they were being very
impatient with me because I had run into
some issues with their hair but this
company did not give me those issues
they let me test it out I bleached it I
did not bleach all of this of course I
did a strand test because I don't like
to bleach my body wave here only because
that bleach will suck the this nice
lustreless of this hair all the way out
so this is what it looks like close up
and it has it all blends thank God
great combination because it did exactly
what I wanted it to do um as far as
putting this in a ponytail I get with
the 360 years and like mind you this is
the first time I've ever work with one
um and it's been the new hot thing the
only thing about these that I really
just don't like is the fact that after
you take the edge blowing trying to
figure out how to put this on the
Capitol it's like MacGyver you have to
figure out how you're going to put the
cap point to put the frontal on to put
the bungles on and usually is you would
think it would be very simple but it's
really not in order first and fit your
head I feel like I made this one a
little bit on a smaller side as far as
the back goes for me to be able to
actually tape or glue the back down it's
still a little further up than I would
like it to be so I still probably should
have looked a little bit more lace right
here to go ahead and slick this part up
and then glue this down but still this
like anything else would need some
plucking because again there when I
received the frontal it was already kind
of pre plucked it's a little bit fuller
than I would like but it doesn't really
bother me in this state if my hair was
straight you're probably look crazy but
it does bloom with the hair very nice I
like the hair personally
it hasn't given me not one issue or one
problem I've never heard of this company
nor have I ever work with them but I
will say that it keeps it keeps its its
body wave as you can see it's still
there because usually after a while
these ends don't do this this is
non-existent after a while and then you
have to go back and keep doing the flexi
rod method but I feel like I gave him
because it still had a wave in it when I
watched it it did not go flat on me it
did not go straight on me it definitely
still had a wave in it it just wasn't
that wave it was more of a regular wave
but because the hair is but because the
hair is forced to be in that body wave
of course when you wrap a some hair
around a barrel then eventually it's
going to be a curl you know so it's the
same difference but just not using heat
this is more of a fordable option for
this particular look this look might run
you for the four bundles that I have and
then probably the 360 frontal you
probably pan up under $400 where most
people's fronts will start at two to
three hundred dollars so if you want
something as um like I would in now let
me just say this
I would not bleach this hair not because
of the whole s-shaped pattern just
because I just don't feel like this hair
could stand up to being bleached and
this hair had no smell when I got it but
I have a sneaking suspicion that it may
have had a little bit of treatment to it
before I don't think it's 100% virgin I
didn't see that it said virgin when I
look at the link but I don't know as of
right now but I don't think that the
hair is virgin I think that a head may
have been treated maybe it was steam
treated to stay like this but sometimes
even then if you put too much color on
something it's just going to kind of
wipe out the luster of the hair it's
going to wipe out you know the entire
integrity of the hair and then you're
going to become a left with just flat
kind of crunchy bundles and if that's
you know if you already on a budget
don't try that's what I always tell you
guys if you're on a budget and you're
buying hair from Aliexpress or even
Amazon or Ebay wherever you're getting
your hair from and you know you don't
have the money like that don't try to do
60 things at once so please don't do
that don't go and buy some hair like
this and then you bleach it to a four
and then you put a color on it and then
two months later you go ahead and decide
I want to be my hair to be black again
and then you put a black rinse on it and
then two months from like you're doing
too much
for something that is really not made
for you to do all that with that's why
the price variance is very different
depending on what you get it from it's a
reason why some hair is cheaper as it is
it's a bit of a shortcut you know it's
the easier alternative to something
that's much more expensive so be mindful
what do you plan on doing with it
because if you plan on wear your hair
straight all the time then there's no
point of binders here it's not because
even if you want a wave sometimes even
with your own hair if you flatiron
something that is originally in this
state too much it will be straight then
you're going to you know a lot of you
want to come play with my hair doesn't
curl up anymore and it's like because
you're literally burning the pattern out
of it whether it was a fake pattern or
it was a real pattern regardless of the
fact you're still burning it out and
that's a big issue in a very mindful of
what you do and how you treat here when
all is said in a proper hair care always
plays a part in what you do with it
because I find it very funny how after a
month sometimes if people have in here
that did you know it was completely fine
and it was no problem and then you start
to wash it and you're not putting the
right products in it then you just start
to say that hair is bad and it's not
that the hair is bad is that you didn't
take care of it very well and that's
usually the problem so I always tell
people keep hair I used to be one of
those people when I used to buy my
bundles to say I want here that can do
everything I want here that straight
that's all of that and this hair is
great in its natural state but if you
want some straight hair then I would go
buy some straight here ok you know if
you want some wavy here I would get a
separate unit for some lady air and at
the discount that they're giving it to
you for I think you can pull up a little
coinage you know so I hope you guys
enjoyed this um I really do and enjoy
the 360 I just have to get used to them
because I'm not wearing my hair in a
ponytail and because I do wear about
four but four to five bundles is hard to
get a very slick ponytail with so many
bundles so I'll go ahead and play with
it but this is my first time working
with one and I I will say I quite like
enjoyed it so I'll catch you guys in my
next one please</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
