this jacket is so long I have a war
distance before I move this better cut
well I think I wore whatever now y'all
know this is my favorite look of all
times is easy is to the point and bow
but it looks different to y'all but it's
different up in her right her so I'm
hitting off from here and writer so I'm
trying to give y'all another view of the
hair like such what army having to move
do it yeah say I feed you too much I
know it's been happy oh really
so this hair which is a Brazilian
straight moment that seems to be the hot
commodity on Aliexpress people can you
look at that though look at girl night
curly torn sheets okay tone sheet so
this is from a comedy caught an enemy
enemy and then in the other then so I
mean my name is be John and girl with
you would think so this is their
Brazilian straight moment and basically
this hair like girl it's big I think it
was like 7 8 9 months ago like we've had
her for a minute okay and if my hair
looks it looks a little weird here
because I'm doing my baby here I kinda
messed up my my makeup so okay so yes
this hair I've had a lot of experience
with and I've had a very long
relationship with uh due to unforeseen
circumstances that work under not under
my control
okay so I do not know the number of I
know I have four bundles and but I don't
remember the limps that they were I
don't really think they were matter at
this point because as you guys can see
she's pretty good
okay she's she's been sliced and diced
it's surfer Bryce now what I will say
about this is the fact that I am
obsessed with this look now this look
was inspired by Beyonce's hair and
jagged edge video for gossipy and that's
still one of my favorite music video
like I'm at all-time bull the version
with the girls in it not the one where
they in the damn field it's somebody
with not that one I'm not a big fan of
that one but I am a huge fan of I guess
this would be the original version and
when they pulled up Beyonce was the last
girl of course and when they pulled up
beyond the hair was definitely just it
was more like this you could really see
it in the video so you can kind of see
all this work I don't bloody in but it
was more like this and she was so cute
and then he read her hair girl I after
you got me like this and you got the
nerve to wet it
I think snot now it's crazy about this
look is that this look was actually very
easy to do it was just a regular way I
mean some regular layers that I just
went in and kept going in and kept born
in it was in the classic 90s look it
does not get old you cannot go wrong
with layers it looks very pretty curl
but I haven't just didn't know straight
here in the wild so I said why not now
because it's been so long I can't
necessarily speak on like I said the
limbs that I have cuz I just really
honestly do not remember but what I can
say is that I love the way that this
blends like do you guys see how well
this blends in with the actual hair like
girl like the frontal and the hey there
one they are a moment they are family
okay and I feel like often when you get
hair sometimes even straight hair
depending it doesn't always match
sometimes it takes some manipulate in
order to get your bundles to match
especially if the hair is actually
virgin hair you got to remember that
sometimes it's not the same donor for
each
one so sometimes the textures will vary
not this one blue not this one boom this
is what I call cohesion cohesion third
if yall hater don't do this girl you
should start over because I know a lot
of times and because I review a lot of
hair I go through this often I have a
huge issue of trying to get here to
blend and make sense and all that great
stuff so for me personally I just like
to have everything kind of laid out
words add in this will be doing ok so I
will speak on the fact that this hair is
so good some of my favorite straight
hair now I know y'all keep asking email
old videos that I said I love straight
hair from this company in that company
and some of those I still feel the same
others not so much
I will do an update video next month
about my favorite I'll Express companies
that I really really likes you know
since that time as well as my virgin
companies even I don't really have that
many anymore and then we'll go from
there but as I can say for right now
this is some of my favorite hair because
it actually holds and true to what it's
supposed to be which is straight here
and it doesn't trying to be anything
else than what it is supposed to be in
intended to me which is some beautiful
just straight to-the-point
balm miss that's it the frontal is
nothing to scream over it's a typical 13
by 4-6 frontal and I don't remember from
whatever reason I just do not remember
this
I remember the wig vividly I just can't
remember making it cuz it's been so long
and y'all don't know y'all will see next
month what my regimen is for reviewing
here so the fact that I could even
remember this I literally had to take
attack and put it in with the name on
these now because of the fact that I'll
be trying attack so I can make sure that
I keep tabs on which wig is what company
you know so I don't remember making this
week I don't I do remember cutting it
but I don't remember making it so it's a
typical 13 by 6 frontal it's really good
it
didn't come really pre plucked it was
kind of it had a pre plucked ish feel to
it but it's not something that I would
be comfortable and just you plug it girl
just plug it so yeah as far as the hair
goes oh that's my favorite part of this
whole thing is the hair because I know
when I need to throw a lid on I can
throw this one on and call it a day I
posted this picture I mean I closed this
picture I posted a couple of times on
snapchat in this wig I did post this in
my instant story because people start
getting asked some questions but I was
doing something on snapchat I do not
remember it's a mess I'm sure and
everybody kept asking about my hair and
I was like I can't tell you guys right
now
what's hair this is and this was so long
ago so then I just posted a couple of
minutes ago and it was like this the
same week that you told us you couldn't
tell us about can you tell us now here
we are okay so from a 1 to a 10 I'll
give them definitely a 10 because I
haven't had no issues with it it does
hold a curl for sure I remember doing
the initial video for this don't know
what happened there
don't ask and I remember that the intro
song was Mary Jane blogs your life and I
was in here whittling and I remember was
curled and I remember saying I'm gonna
I'm gonna love this install I'm gonna
anything it just didn't happen I don't
know what happened that day I don't know
what was going on that day but something
just didn't work but Blair okay
so it never happened so now we're here
and in the VapoRub 2018 this will be out
in 2017 you love me right all right so
yeah like I said it's really not much to
say other than I really do like this
hair a lot and this is some like a lot
of my hair do not do this to save its
life this is what you want especially
when it's hot like this would have been
great Coachella hair at night cuz you
know when your hair is like this it gets
really hot okay if I look a little shiny
I'm not it's just it's my highlighter
it's my highlighter I feel like a beauty
influence or just
highlighter so you know I just feel
later so yeah you know I just I just
feel I feel sexy I feel sexy I feel
glamorous so if you are interested in
this her hit the links below make sure
if you like this her the intro song I
Jackie my background the music the color
the background you click like okay like
I said do something and I would
definitely catch you guys in my next one
but yeah let me know how you guys like
this just a side note to me doing my
hair like this just keep in mind that I
do used viana zone heat protecting spray
on all of my straight hair and then I
also like to use Sebastian's super hold
hairspray
- so that's what's in is to keep it
tanked and down so when you get it you
can have to manipulate it just a little
bit to stay like such but I hope you
guys definitely enjoyed this and Knobble
catch you peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
