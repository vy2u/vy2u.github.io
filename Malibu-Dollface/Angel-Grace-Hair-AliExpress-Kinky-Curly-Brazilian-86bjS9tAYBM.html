know I like it big and currently okay
the bigger the better honey so this hair
is super I just was talking about this
and I was like I don't find some good
straight hair and go wait here from
aliexpress we ain't it curly it thank
God I got it y'all
cuz this is poppin so this is from a
company called grace hair extensions
this is the UM pamphlet I guess you
could say I was sent and the information
is in here if I can get the dang thing
oh um it pretty much is a haircare guide
there is always be gentle in handling
when to watch how to wash how to keep
from tangling frizzing how to use how to
use heat selling tools when you need to
color what if um severely tangled or
knowledge not it so this is a whole
thing of information on and back for
those who are just starting with hair
and don't know exactly what they're
doing so to the bundles that I'm wearing
right now so these are all of my bundle
wrappers and my closure wrapper and
before we waiting forthe further this is
one of the texts that came on all of our
bundles and it says 100% brazilian remy
hair and it says that it's unprocessed
human hair the color is a natural de
Linda one of the lens was twenty and
then the weight was 3.5 ounces which is
a typical for per bundle okay so I'm
currently wearing a 24 a 22 a 20 and the
18 with a matching 18 inch closure so
this is how it looks
up close well so you get the texture so
it has its various kinky curly so it has
is a very kinky but natural hair
look to it this hair is very similar to
some other hair that I wore once before
it was like this but except the curls
were bigger so they wasn't as small so
this one gives you more of a natural
this is my natural hair I failed to it
so what I went ahead and did was when I
was installing them I noticed that my
bottom of three bundles smelt completely
like nothing my top bundles had a
permission L to them so it says this
hair is 100% unprocessed hair what I
think they did you know I got my
theories what I think they did with his
hair is a steam process if meaning they
pretty much put the hair it could have
been straight hair uh maybe the natural
texture of it and then they put it in a
steaming process which causes it to
permanently stay like this so it's not a
chemical process but it is a process so
I don't know if that's what they did it
cuz it is 100% you know not processed
here but the reason why I'm it's hard
for me to believe that because the
closure that I have in um the roots of
this closure are very straight so it's
very it's not very natural that the
roots of this would be like this but
then when you get back here it starts to
get curly that means that this is not
the natural texture of the hair because
nobody's here when I have curly hair
it's curly from the root all the way
down withers in a closure or a bundle um
it's not a major break for me because I
get it you know it's hard to find
bundles from a donor that all will be
the same texture um but it doesn't smell
bad it had a little bit of a stench so
back to my original point what I did was
when I put it in I washed only the top
two because those are the ones that
smells funny and left the bottom how
they came pretty much so the bottoms are
not washed but the tops are because I
wanted to see how if the texture would
stay the same if I washed it but didn't
wash it you know sometimes you have to
or sometimes your only color so much
here let's just say I wanted to ombre
effect so I was like I don't want to
bleach the bottoms of my hair but of
course to wrench the bleep wrench to
rinse the bleach out you have to wash it
but messages saying let's just say you
didn't want to wash the top you don't
want two different textures going on so
it actually did say the same it blends
the same um I don't know if you bleached
it because I don't really like to bleach
my curly hair because it's very porous
and they tended the hair tends to dry
out a lot of the time so I like to keep
it in its natural state that's why you
don't ever see me unless it comes like
that and it was professionally done I
don't really like to bleach curly hair
or even way to here for that matter
sometimes like body wave I probably do
it but because this is so much texture I
would just hate to kill it for some
color but anyway um I've had this hair
for almost a month now and I of course I
don't know if y'all knew not sure but I
only wear wigs I do not wear so in so
this does come off it does not i'm sewn
in so that's why my curls have been like
this since I've had it because as soon
as I got it I did install it I've just
been trying to wear because curly hair
is very different from straight hair it
will be great in the beginning and then
the more and more you go with it it will
probably start to tangle and mad on you
if you do lay on it again I only wear
wigs I do not wear this to sleep so
therefore I know I couldn't tell you how
it is if I slept on it or if I took a
shower with it cuz I take it off at
night I don't keep it on and I actually
use this new cap um from Sally's Beauty
Supply that I actually really like it
was like I usually use a spandex spandex
ones but this was a weaving cap with the
like adjustable strap in the back and I
did it actually is very uncomfortable um
sometimes when you do your hair you end
up making them a little too small or
sometimes too big the pink and sometimes
I'll be watching TV and only paying
attention but I do really like it the
hair itself is great again the only
issue that I've had thus far was that
initial smell and I just didn't like the
fact that um it's a lot of shedding when
it comes down to running your fingers
through because it is so
in full so now I don't have any show you
initially when I first put it in I was
getting a nice amount of shitty it
wasn't minimal it was a nice amount you
know but after wearing it a while then
it definitely is no more like I can do
this and there there's no problem
you know I think that was two three so
yeah at first it was like a lot and
that's because you try to get one you're
cutting your with unfold mines although
you could fold these because it's bigger
hair so you don't have to make it super
duper flat you can kind of get away with
being a little bit lazy with it um if
you don't want to have to really go in
like that but I always cut mine so when
you cut your web snow matter how great
or little you know how intricate you are
with cutting them you're going to get a
bit of Shetty
that's just what comes with the
territory because you're breaking the
sill of the weft and you're breaking the
hair pattern and everything that just
happens but eventually it'll stop if the
hair is um tied very well and it's put
in very well so I so far since I've had
it
um for the this almost a good month I've
been wearing this on and off I just
don't post pictures on Instagram when
I'm wearing hair because I don't want
people to start asking me about the hair
before I'm ready to actually review it
so I won't put a selfie up of me and his
hair and cuz I'm gonna get a whole bunch
of questions about who's this hair from
so that's why I tend to stay away from
social media if I'm not wearing
something I've already reviewed but
anyway but this hair is definitely
affordable compared to the hair I have
like this because I think there was when
I did the math it was like a five to six
hundred dollar price difference and the
hair personally to me feels the same it
doesn't feel that much different so if
you go to my videos because I just want
to mention a company because I think
it's just kinda techie but if you want
to go to my videos and see I'm kind of
standing like this and I have like I
think a tan jacket on I think so I
remember um my hair is really big like
this and if you want to compare the
prices you definitely can but I do like
this a whole lot I'll give you a picture
I'm going to put
a view of what it looks like from the
back because it is still very big and
full and this is all of it this is four
bundles I think I have informed one when
I take 24 so yeah having four bundles
and a closure store 24 22 2018 in the
18-inch closure that's all you're going
to need and you're not a person that
likes very very big hair then three
bundles would do it for you but no less
than three because again this is curly
hair and every time people ask me about
curly hair I always tell them make sure
you get a closure if you don't know how
to install it find somebody who does in
your local area because trying to blend
this hair with your natural hair unless
it looks like this if your natural looks
like this knock yourself out and try to
blend it out but if it does not look
like this in your hair is very coarse or
it's very straight this is going to look
crazy you know so I want a match
enclosure my closure is here you can't
see it because my bandana is kind of in
the way but it's like I always say just
I think my hair is just so not this
texture in the front so you know we try
to make it do what it do
um again this is from grace here I've
never worked with them before but I also
want to say thank you to the company
because they have been very patient with
me which a lot of companies especially
Alex price base are very not sometimes
they're very rude but grace arm hair was
very very very sweet to me um I really
love this hair I already have something
like it so maybe I shouldn't sell this
unit anybody interested let me know
um but yeah having this a while I will
say that this is definitely some some
nice hair okay I don't want to rave
about it and say it's wonderful because
a lot of time you guys ask me can your
hair be bleached and if it's he if it
says it is human you can bleach it will
it take to bleach that's the question
and I tend to not dabble in a lot of
color because I do like my hair to be
natural like this I'm not really one for
a lot of color but hey we'll see um but
shout out to grace hair all the
information for this particular hair
will be below I did a tutorial on how to
create your own wig using hair very
similar to this so go look for it is
some
we're here on my page I will put the
link to that below and I will catch
y'all and my next one of my big frog yo
ah I do like yogurt okay bye
