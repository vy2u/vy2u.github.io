don't give this hands your skies I just
wanna get to the eyes tell me these dyes
nothing better fast jump along - hello
oh oh oh okay so you guys know uh I
believe it was my last video or the
video before my last video I gave you
guys a sneak peek of my hair and my hair
was green and I was like that's all i'ma
give y'all and I say if you guys put
below who my inspiration for this hair
was if you were if you know if you know
me then you would know who it was then
let me know so a lot of you guys are got
it right below and it was kelis um I'll
put a picture from that the the what
inspired me um was this hair from her
video get along with you which is by far
besides trilogy is my favorite cailli
song ever so I remember when
kaleidoscope which was my first album
which the song was for came how it was
just as girls screaming on the truck
with this crazy hair she had his green
hair and she had it was like green and
pink um and I just thought she was dope
and after I got her album I was totally
upset and had been obsessed ever since
even with her new food album that came
out I think like a year and a half ago
two years ago I remember um but I was
playing a song and then I was like I'm
gonna go watch the video because um the
video had a very um Nightmare Before
Christmas theme to it which I thought
was really dope at the time and still
today so I looked at our hair was like
her hair so dope I want to do that I
want to put my own spin on it but I
definitely want that it was gonna
venture it originally it was going to be
exactly what she had which was the bone
straight hair with the side part and it
was going to
blue at the bottom I brought blue color
to go with this but eventually I just
just decided against it cuz I just
wanted it all green okay so this hair is
from Angel grace hair not to be was
thinking with gray hair
um this is an Aliexpress vendor and I
had this hair for over six months at
this particular point it's taken me a
while to get to this review for a lot of
different reasons
not until I just moved it I bleach the
hair so my hair has been bleached for a
little bit of up under a month but I
wore this particular hair for the
longest and when I originally got the
hair I had the worst shading issues with
it possible so what I did was when I
started to get this shedding issue
because usually with Brazilian straight
hair I never had this issue so I didn't
know why my bundles were so I just went
ahead and I sold them so I took the wig
apart redid and this is when I started
to use newer caps with the haps that I
use now and I just went ahead and sewed
it back together and I still my tracks
and I don't have any more of shedding
issues so the hair was super duper soft
so I was like if the hair is this soft
and it didn't smell funny it didn't have
any inkling that it had been processed
at any point then I felt like bleach
would definitely be its friend so what I
did was I went ahead as I showed you
guys before it's the same bleach that I
used to bleach my frontals
40 valium peroxide and I use my b/w
bleach I went ahead threw it on the hair
and it turned this very brownish color
and I was like okay cool
so then the next order of business was
what are you where are you going to get
your green from that was my whole thing
so because after I bleached it I didn't
have any shedding issues I went ahead
and bleached my closure last because I
just wanted to see if it was gonna what
was going to happen so I knew I was
going to need two different versions of
green because what I didn't want was my
hair to be flat and it be one green
color so what you're looking at right
now is two different greens that I
pretty much put together so when I did
it I bleach um like I split my hair into
the wig and I did the back a darker
green and I did the front well the top
and the bottom a lighter green so that
when I curled it it gave you this green
so it's as you can see it's a little
darker here it's darker here but it's
lighter here so it just gives you some
green dimension is not just one note um
a lot of times when people do color I
noticed that a lot of times their color
but it's usually one note there is no
dimension in the hair the hair looks
dead it has no life to it so if you ever
notice that when I do a colored hair I
tend to do dimensions and I you'd like
to use at least two colors I'm doing
another color right now that's very
similar to this but it's different so
you'll see it's from another company so
let's get to my bundles so like I stated
I am wearing four bundles of Brazilian
straight so I'm wearing a 20 or 22 and
224 s I have a silk base closure which
is 20 inches so I decided what style I
was gonna do with this I knew how I was
gonna curl it how I was gonna cut it how
I was gonna wear it and I was happy
because at least it was a silver closure
it wasn't a lace closure since I didn't
get a frontal but because I got this
hair so long ago I don't even think I
was missing my frontals when they sent
me this hair so another company's been a
little teed off at me because it's taken
me this long to get to the review but
because I knew I was going to put a
color in his hair then my life and move
in and all of that great stuff it just
got kind of lost in translation so great
angel grace hair please don't be upset
with me um but it turned out great the
hair took color like a G it took the
bleach like a G and I was afraid
SuperDuper afraid that my hair was going
to be very hard and it wasn't going to
look like this and it wasn't gonna have
any luster when all was said and done
so I use my the Tresemme I believe is
Chris man yeah my Tresemme um moisture
rich after I did it to make sure that I
still have some life in my hair there's
nothing worse than bleaching your hair
and your hair comes out terrible so I
wanted you guys to see that even though
it is Aliexpress hair
does take the most issue in the major
issue that I did have with this hair was
when I first got it it was super soft
which was great but it was shedding
which was a problem so I did have to
steal my website of you guys actually
what do I do to seal my lips I just
simply by the Allens which you can get
from michaels or you can get from your
local Joanne's or online and it's there
no fray and it's made for um clothes so
that if you do cut a seam or whatever
you can just and it will not start to
tear and unravel that's pretty much what
it does so I don't know the West looked
fine to me I don't understand where the
shading was coming from and mind you
this is before I put the bleach on it I
started to have this major shedding
issue so I decided okay well let me just
see if I SIL the web's maybe they were
the web's were improperly constructed um
from what I seen there was really no
major issue other than the fact that the
hair shed that's on my only thing um now
I'm not getting any shedding as you can
see so that little hiccup I contacted
the company about it and I think were
asking me like what's going over your
review and I'm like well the thing that
I'm trying to do right now is I'm trying
to Dennis hilarious so it was the fire
truck going by and the dogs decided they
wanted to start howling at the moon I've
never heard Ritchie ever do that oh okay
okay that's my point
so um that was the only thing that I had
a big issue it was the beginning
shedding again I went ahead and sold
them I'm not having that issue anymore I
can't really say for anybody else but
for me personally once I saw them I was
good so the colors that I used I use
manic panics of electric lizard and then
I use a door spring green as my other
color so when I combine the two because
when I put a blue Manic Panic on it I
just didn't think that it was going to
take so I washed I tried and I was like
I don't really see because my hair was
like on a brownish I was not like six
thirteen blonde it was more on the honey
blonde side so I was like I don't think
this color is gonna work so I rinsed it
up and I put my track on my bundles and
my closure
outside the next morning when I woke up
I looked at the little piece that I had
rinsed off and it was super green so I
was like okay so it's gonna work so I
was running out of color
none of the Sally's that I was going to
have any electric lizard left so I was
like oh I need a secondary color anyway
so let's just see what adore has so I
made my way back to the hood um and of
course they had a whole bunch of the
door colors which are way cheaper than
manic panics colors and they work just
as good so I will say I like the
electric lizard but I just hate that
they're $10 a bottle Manic Panic um but
um it did definitely work on my hair I
love this color like nobody's business
people and yeah so if you guys are
definitely interested um check the link
below for angel Grey's hair shout out to
them for being very patient with this
process of this color and I'll get a
close-up so you guys can see how green
it really is yes darling so it's
SuperDuper green and in the Sun it's
crazy green um but I definitely in my
hair was like uh like a 1b originally
and I just went ahead and left my roots
of one beat and then faded it out here
to start the bleaching to start the
color down here because of course I need
it a little bit on the black roots and I
just thought it would work because I was
doing a darker secondary color so it
definitely had more of a has a more of a
tree then like the Kylie Jenner blac
chyna um green which is like more of
more of the electric green but it's from
top so I didn't want that I wanted to
look like it was woven or I could go
somewhere with this hair like hey how
you doing and people that all your hair
is green out oh my god Joe here's Marie
