yes
gentle so y'all know I can never relate
realest ruling rusty I can never resist
having a Morticia Addams moment every
now and then I just can't um so hey John
did y'all catch the intro of all of the
slang goodness that's popping all look I
don't try to new meth it's not even a
new method this is a method I did in a
minute to give my age this flat dole you
know
okay so hairs from angel Grey's hair
okay
do not read oh yeah get it down look
effortless because I'm struggling right
now I'm struggling I'm struggling people
of them struggling alright so I can't
remember if I had straight hair from
them I'm sure if you go and look on my
page to see if I have I'm almost certain
I have to make this statement I
personally think that they're um stray
hairs really nice um I I feel like stray
hair is one of those things that is hard
to mess up um so if you mess up straight
hair good riddance
so when you receive your hair you do get
this little washing instructions and
it's did this it's pretty
self-explanatory on how you should wash
your hair
I am currently rocking four bundles of
28-inch yes girl that got all one length
except for the front because my frontal
is 20 inches and it's a it's like a 13 I
think it's like a 13 by 4 so as you can
see you know I told you I like wigs
better because I can give my Kardashian
parts well with these I can do the very
same um this one is actually much longer
um as far as parting goes it's just as
long as it is why so a lot of times when
I do get frontals the parting space will
be a nice amount but it will only be a
I'm out in the middle a side part like
my it goes from here all the way around
to here so I would personally opt for
this frontal versus any other one due to
the simple fact that I just like to have
more of a rate of being able to part my
hair versus being kind of stuck now this
is their Brazilian straight and I love
love love straight hair
personally I have now you guys notice as
recently I've been doing a lot of
curling a lot of curly a lot of wavy a
lot of loose wave but y'all know I
always got to bring it back home with
this one because babe a listen um if you
want to do anything straight related
this is this this dish okay you can't go
wrong with this and I feel like for me
personally it it complements me better
then I feel like any other hair texture
does I just fall in love with straight
hair when I was just a little boy Barbie
was you know of course my idol forever
and the Barbies that I love the most
where the markets who have the most
longest hair you know totally hair
barbie is still by far one of my
favorites ever because her weave is
ridiculous and then she got her bangs
this short okay so normally when I do
straight hair you guys know I like my
hair to be bone straight and I like it
to be super duper flatness it's always
super duper flat but it's never this
flat you want to know why because I
usually so I did not show this in I
actually use an old method that I wanted
to kind of just to see if I was still
like if I would still like it as much as
I would like sewing my hair on so I did
the hot glue gun method now I did not
glue my phone tool down I actually sold
that down but it took me 1 hour 1 hour
to do my entire wig including the sewing
of the frontal I had glue gun all of the
beautiful wax and and the thing that I
love about this method for and I think
I'm gonna go ahead and do a tutorial for
those who are just not well-versed in
sewing I I feel you struggle I know how
you feel um
this will be something that's much
easier to do it's much more affordable
to do um if you're making your own wigs
and you don't have anybody to make them
or you just want to try it and you don't
know I feel like um it would be fun um
because I listen I was able to knock out
this wig um when did I do this I did
this a minute ago but I was able to do
like four wigs in one day versus where I
can usually do two in one day with and I
still had other stuff going on okay um
so it was this one it was one that I
already reviewed um that one was hot
glue gun too but the thing that I really
love about this method back to my
original point which I'll never stay on
um is the fact that when you have glue
gun it and you because you have to cut
your web snow for those who are you
can't do the phone over method with
method with this it just it won't work
but the great thing about this is that
because of the glue is on the web it's
like silly your webs at the same time so
I have got zero shedding with this hair
and I believe is because I did that
method so um if you are a person who is
trying to do something really quick or
you just not you know someone isn't your
thing you don't have the time um thumbs
up this video if you want to see a
tutorial on how I made this hot glue gun
we um now this method that I use also is
the guts to be glued method as well
which it should have been well it will
be a video separate from this one that
shows me put in this actual lid on now
um when you do this and you do hot glue
gun it and that whole thing it will come
off so don't be if you are using virgin
hair don't be afraid don't be scared
just don't get it in the hair only put
it on the web's
but um you can it holds
like a rock kind of like the guys to be
glued it's really fast it's easy to
pillow kind of like an Aggies hair glue
which you can also do and the reason why
I was like what what could I do that's
not going to take me forever because I
remember that particular day I just had
so much stuff to do and I was like I
have to do this is gonna have to go
ahead and review it now I had already
washed the hair I had already kind of
trimmed it at the ends as you can see I
was gonna do a blunt cut but I don't
know how I was gonna look on this longer
the hair I think you're just gonna look
kind of stupid plus I'm gonna do
something else with this so I did go
ahead and trim the ends a little bit so
it says 28 so I got like a 26 now it
does hit me right here and I believe
that it's a true 28 because when I
measured it into 24 usually hits me here
so that's about 4 inches I'm telling you
just make sure like I always say you
condition your hair I did Co wash my
tracks twice before I actually installed
my hair I just went over it with my nice
thick Remington Flatiron which I got a
lot of questions about so so this is the
one that I use and I believe I have
another one that I believe it's the same
brand I think it's just purple and this
is the one I use when I do straight hair
because because it's a bigger I can
cover a large a much larger area of hair
to Flatiron
yeah then I could if I did a smaller one
so I got this one from Target um they
might be like purple now I don't know if
they still come in red but it's just a
Remington I don't know if it has a
specific name I've had this one for like
3 years it's never done me wrong it's
great guys
there's my Pammy front so I went ahead
and bleached the front so I also went
ahead and plucked the frontal which I
did not show only because I was doing it
and I was looking at complete and utter
mess so I wasn't about to pull out a
camera I listen it ain't that deep
so umm I personally like to UM when I
what I do bleach my frontals I
personally like to pluck them after I
bleached him only because the hair is a
bit weaker and it's easier to pull the
hairs out of the lace I find out when
you
first get the hair and you first get it
and you go ahead before you bleach it
and you pluck it um you are pulling
quite hard at the lace and you could
possibly especially if you're new to
this you could possibly put a hole in
your lace which then you ain't even
sewed it down and you already got a hole
in it so if this is new to you just take
your time don't don't get crazy with it
because you I'm telling you soon as you
put a bit of a rip and it is pretty much
here so don't do that just make sure
that when you do it you make sure that
your bleach is like almost like cottage
cheese because a lot of you guys have
hit me up and saying like I bleached it
and then the bleach went through and now
my roots are blonde what do I do
well you go get some colors and usually
I tell people like if you just didn't
get some like cellophane and you gonna
have to just ride it on out and you know
get the roots back to black until that
hair has been conditioned and Co washed
enough where you feel like it's strong
enough to handle actual like permanent
color but um to a boy to have to repair
that just make sure like I said that
your bleach is at least very thick
because what you want to do is you want
to be it like kind of like peanut butter
so you can spread it across the knots
but it does not leak into the hair once
it starts to leak into the hair if you
if you take the bowl and you go like
this and it starts to move it's still
not thick enough okay so you just want
to be able to have it where it's not
powdery and it doesn't you know
penetrate the hair shaft I mean it
doesn't get the knot but you also don't
want it to be too we're just going to
run and even that with these blonde
roots and then you have a reverse ombre
which it really isn't that cute if it's
an accident so angel grace hair
y'all get an a-plus-plus for me cuz I'm
in love and again I my other hair that
had which was like my supermodel hair I
did the Versace hmmm get down with I
gave that hair away so it feels good to
have some long hair but not
my 34 inch here or my 40 in chair just
something I I'm not sitting on you know
I think it comes it comes at my bubble I
just - just just the tips so yeah hit
the links below if you guys are
interested and um thumbs up this video
and put down if you want to see a
tutorial for the hot glue gun mentok
because I'm telling y'all it's gonna say
go look I really just forgot like I
literally I didn't think about it I was
like I don't know but you know I some
people prefer something and it doesn't
last as long as Eisley you saw it in
however um for me golden kept y'all in
my next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
