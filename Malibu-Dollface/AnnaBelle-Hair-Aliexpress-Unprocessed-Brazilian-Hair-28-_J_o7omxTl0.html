you guys will be happy to know that I
did a tutorial on this look okay and it
should be up now if you're watching this
and if it's not it's on its way
but anyway it's gonna be about my hair
that's what this video is going to be
about and I will go on record by saying
this right now this is the best l
expressed straight hair that I've ever
had hands down okay so it is from a
company called Annabelle hair so we're
going to get into my bundles and my
closure real quick and I wonder if you
guys notice anything different
I'm gonna get you a second to figure out
if y'all see anything different about my
hair usually because it's you know this
is my favorite look - do you guys know
um and it's long so you guys know how
this go but defy you to see anything
different hmm my part is on this side
instead of this side imma put a picture
of what it usually look like yep
so I decided to change out my part on an
accident because when I actually did my
closure
y'all got a closure this is not a
frontal this is a closure can you
believe we don't talk about all that in
a second but this company is poppin when
I was doing my actual closure and I mind
you I've had this hair since December
like December I'm gonna have like 20th
probably so I've had this since last
year late last year and it's Memorial
energy so this is the 100% virgin remy
unprocessed hair in a natural color
they're all 3.5 ounces each this is what
all my bundles came in these I put all
the tracks backing them and they all had
this little sticker on the front that
said a natural 28 so I did what I always
do which is put my wig on a cap and then
I went ahead and made it what I did
differently I have been wearing a hair
typically like are always weird then
when I got my frontal I decided to kind
of
shut up so what I did was I went ahead
and plucked my closure as you can see
it's right here so if I move it is right
there so this is my part and then this
is where my closure is so my cap is up
underneath there my baby here and then
this goes right on top and you can't
tell at all so the other thing that I
really left out in this situation was my
edges people my edges so I just do some
things that are a little bit different
with this unit that I normally do so the
first thing I did was of course I
plugged my closure so my closure is a 4
by 4 closure which pretty much goes from
about here to here so my side part is
just right here and then it stops here
in the back which I will show you guys
once I do um once I upload my frontal
I'll show you in my function tutorial
I'll show you guys exactly um what the
difference is between a closure and a
frontal because I don't think people
know the different I've explained it but
I don't think until you see it you're
gonna believe it so what I did was I
went ahead and sewed it on like I
normally do I use a different cap now
normally I would use a spandex dome cap
which you get pretty much from any local
beauty supply but so lately I've been
going since at least to get my caps
because you guys know that normally were
when I was staying in LA I will go to
one particular beauty supply and they
would have the dome caps that I like but
since I moved um the problem that I've
had is actually trying to find AB don't
cap that works for me and when I went to
Sally's they sold these and you would
think that house is going to work with
all of this extra material at the top
for the wave which is really funny now
um I like to work with these better
because you don't have to measure a
person's head in order to make the wig
so pretty much this wig it has enough
versatility where it could pretty much
work on anybody's head because the
actual cap which I'll show you it's
really thick but it stretches enough so
this is how much it stretches so if you
sew in a person's head is the
let's just say the mannequin hands
you're working on but they're on well
the mannequin head is a certain size but
when you actually put on your clients
head it'll do this to give them and it
actually stays snug I don't have any jum
elastic bands in this wig is literally
just on so that's what I'm able to just
simply do this and boom you just never
know you pull it right there to the line
and boom nobody would know unless they
got all up on you now this is an actual
lace closure
it's not a silk base closure and the
reason why I love some base closure so
much over lace closures is because I
don't have to worry about this part
right here which is the lace part I did
not bleach the nuts on my closure just
because I didn't have time to do it so I
knew that this was going to be in the
side part so I went ahead and plug the
part and just kind of cleaned it up
because I just feel like it was laying
around for like my my natural part looks
like this so it's not too skinny roomy
mom it and I love with me by the way I
just don't really like her heart too
much but I just feel like your parts
look a little more natural when you take
a little bit of time with them I used a
nude cap of underneath as you guys seen
that I've gotten I don't have a specific
place to get the caps because I don't
buy them I usually come with my wigs
when I get them or my closures when I
get them they tend to send a new wig cap
so that you can see about anything and
looks like scalp now to my actual
bundles again I'm rocking four bundles
of 28-inch and I don't know what it is
it says this is unprocessed hair so
we're going to go with that for the
moment however this hair is just so like
can you see how straight it is and I
watch this here about four times since
look how straight it is it doesn't move
when it it's not supposed to move it's
not everywhere if I put a fan to this
then it's not going to be a big wind
tunnel mess and I'm going to look amiss
it's going to actually flow now I'm
going to compare this hair to some other
hair that I have to show that it is
comparable and this hair is actually
from a u.s.
a stellar so this is my hour glam hair
and this hair is my straight um it's
just my straight I believe it's my trick
Brazilian hair and it is it yours you
guys can see the way I'm waving my head
it's not going anywhere it's still lush
you can see the luster in that and
that's exactly what this is no I'm not
going to weigh my hair like I was doing
it every year because I was having too
much fun and I have on lip glass so no
it does have this nice flow to it as you
guys can see and I love when straight
hair is tamed I cannot stand when hair
is everywhere and it doesn't want to
blend it's not soft I can I do this a a
lot Bobby boss you know that's pack hair
and it look like this in a package but
it doesn't stay like this again I've had
this hair since December so I've been
wearing it on and off every since and
I'm freaking in love you guys like
Annabelle hair and I've never heard of
them I've never work with them before
they just gave me a chance to really
really test out this hair like I really
want to because a lot of times when I do
reviews people want to rush you and I
always take that is you're trying to
rush me because the hair is not good so
you're trying to before I actually start
set where where where did you want me to
do a review for that's why I usually
just say no but they actually have not
bothered me one bit they have great
customer service they've been super
sweet super nice they send me great
quality hair in the test you know I
actually purchased this here for someone
else different address different name
different phone number got the same
quality hair yo this is what I'm talking
about okay so when people say bad things
about Aliexpress I see the same person
and yes they're all are few a-holes on
Aliexpress but Annabelle hair where is
the damn thing this company they're
going okay and there's and that's my
honest to god always give you guys the
on front and and the truth but this
y'all I'm telling y'all when it comes to
straight hair it is beautiful now the
only hang-up I'm gonna say is that it's
100% unprocessed hair and I've stated
this before you should
if it's 100% unprocessed it's going to
have like your real hair a little
poofiness to it and this hair is bone
SuperDuper straight and I've had
straight Brazilian hair before and I've
had it this long before but I've never
had it this straight in its stay the
street you know when I wash it it still
has a very straight you know some hair
y'all ever notice that when you wash
some of yo up straight here it gets a
little body wave ish on you mm-hmm it
did not do that it stayed straight so I
don't know if either the donor is just
popping or it may have been steam
processed to say straight I don't know
when it says 100% unprocessed so we're
going to go with that for now um if you
guys do purchase this hair please let me
know how it worked on you because it's
been working for me very very very very
very well and when I do wear it if you
were asked me know what kind of hair is
this and I tell them that is from
aliexpress they'd be like you mean a
place that people be getting corn chip
here and I'm like yes they like mmm I'm
having to try that and it's a good price

very understanding um that I really just
wanted to have a chance with this hair

of times I boarded in it a couple of
times I've done a lot of things that is
here and it's still held up and their
closure is actually very good I like
