lean back so it can fit the frame hood
so I had to sit down for this one
because um if I stand up that my hair is
not gonna fit in the frame okay so this
oh okay
so this hair this look was inspired by a
lot of the girls that I see on Instagram
and their hair is usually a frontal and
usually it's their buns be so big and
stupid for like whose button needs to be
this big for what reason
okay you want to use every last inch of
hair you had so you just legal figure it
out
um I will post a below where my friends
are from um so - there
this is Annabelle's hair and this is
their Brazilian body wave now as you can
see the texture is a bit different from
what my normal body wave will look like
when I usually review it because I
wanted to try something a little bit
different with it so this is 22 inches I
believe I have four 22s and I think I
have a 20 a 20 inch frontal so yes
ladies and gentlemen I am wearing a
front so let me get close so as you can
see baby we got a lot of front to action
popping off right here none of this is
mines um so what I did was my normal
morning rule my normal routine which is
I go ahead
and I make the wig so I bleached the
nuts on my frontal I installed it and
then I also installed my bundles and
then what I did was I took the hair and
I took my wand and I wanted it all away
from my face so that I can get this nice
wavy look this hair that's in here is
the ponytail that comes from our frontal
but if anybody knows anything about
frontals you know that when you do get a
frontal it's usually just about this
much forward so you don't have you're
like if I part my hair my real hair
I usually party from from behind my ear
all the way up to about here so since my
frontal is I don't believe this is a 13
by 4 I don't believe so um what I had to
end up doing was adding some more hair
so I purposely didn't put all the hair
into the wig because I wanted to make
sure I had a massive fun to go with this
so I just simply took the hair put it in
a ponytail what pretty much is my anchor
and then I just wrapped all the rest of
the hair that I have which was probably
about this much hair and I just wrapped
it and put it into a nice thick tall
button you know and then I decided to be
half naked because that seems to work on
Instagram
um so yeah so - my experience with this
hair we start this by saying that this
hairs ends I don't like okay um so I'm a
backup so as you can see they have been
cut and they're a little more even than
I would have liked but they were a bit
split at the ends and I don't know if
this whoa two of them two of my bundles
were split the other two were fine so I
ended up having to cut my hair just a
little bit so that it could all be even
because I had to cut those split ends
off or I would not have curled like I
wanted to so that's why I have a bit of
a blunt cut at the bottom as far as the
actual bundles themself when I did
Costco wash my hair I got a very typical
minimal shedding as far as if holding a
actual curl as you can see these were
actually done yesterday
day I Hearst initially did it and I
didn't have the bun I just did it and
then did my entire head I did notice
that it held a curl for about a day and
then after the day it ended up like
falling tremendously so those nice
ringlet curls that I did with the wand
end up falling after about a day which
is pretty normal because his hair is
very fine it's not full by any means as
far as the um that single webs are
concerned it do I have a full head yes
do I love it yes it doesn't give me any
issues as far as that's concerned as far
as fullness is concerned but each even
they're like my frontal they plucked his
hair in here very well so that it was um
well ventilated but it was also very
fine so it did mimic real hair so I
didn't have a problem with trying to put
this into a ponytail because a lot of
times well most of the time when you get
a frontal it's so crowded because
they're trying to give you as much hair
as they can but it didn't takes away
from it because you end up plucking most
of the hair out anyway because you just
wanted to look as natural as they can in
the front so as you guys can see it's
really flat it was easy to get in it was
very simple to install which I love and
I love the fact that this is I believe
my second my second or third review for
Annabelle's hair you guys know I had
said at a point that my favorite
straight hair was theirs and it was and
it still to my opinion and still some
very great straight hair I'll put a
picture I own that way anymore my friend
Xiaomi uh we went to the mosquito
fashion show and I gave her my I believe
I had a 28 inch or 30 inch and I just
reposted that video of me with that hair
and she still loves it every time I see
her she has a twin horn so it's still
going solid for her it's a very very
very good
good good great hair as far as this hair
goes if I was going to rate it from a 1
to a 10 I would give it a a tanned 1/2
and the only reason why I would give it
an 8 and a half is because my two
bundles at the bottom I did not like the
texture of the ends for those two and
then as far as my frontal those the body
wave in the frontal was
ideal for me I just didn't it didn't
really match it matched but it wasn't
100% like this was hence why I changed
the entire texture altogether because
what I didn't want to do is end up with
two different textures trying to make it
blend so I just said I'm just going to
change everything itself now as far as
color goes um what I originally intended
to do with this hair was I was going to
I'm brave from here down and I was going
to make it this pink but because of the
ends looking like they did I just didn't
want to take the chance for color my
strands has proved that it will lift as
far as color goes but you would just
have to be careful and if I was you I'll
be lifted in stages I would not lift it
all at once
um you're supposed to do that anyway but
what I mean by that is if I wanted my
hair to be kind of like this color on a
my hair to be kind of more on this side
I would do this in like two different um
applications versus trying to pull it
all up in one only because if you do
pull it up at once and then you start to
see that it's not as strong as whatever
then you could save yourself not ruining
here
um so keep that in mind but it does take
color because my strands that they
didn't break off it wasn't brassy I just
would because this hair has been treated
in some way and I don't know exactly
which way if it was steam treated if it
was uh chemically treated I can't tell
because it didn't come with no smell or
anything like that so I wouldn't you
know when you when you put a chemical on
a chemical you won't get a reaction
that's just what happens so most of the
time that's why I like to do the strand
test because there have been times where
I've had hair and then would not bleach
it just would not bleach which had me
believe it was not what they were saying
it was I've had hair where it bleached
but then it came out a brassy red color
you know so that's s indication that
there's something in it this actually is
souped right up in like I want to say
like nine ten minutes and it was blond
I just wanted to yeah okay so just to be
honest
sigh just do a strand test always with
your hair before you throw it on all
your bundles because you can really do
some damage with a strand you can cut it
off and keep it pushing
so if you guys are interested in this
hair from Annabelle hair let me know um
I don't know if y'all want a tutorial on
this look I don't think it needs a
tutorial it's pretty self-explanatory
um it's the bun at the top is some waves
at the bottom but if you guys really
feel that strongly about it I will do
one um I'll tell you what if you want to
I mean if you want a tutorial for this I
will use the wig that I just made for my
hot glue gun wig you know what I'll give
it away give it away right after I
review it I'll go ahead and give it away
to somebody so we'll do that thumbs up
if you want to a tutorial slash um
how-to video for this look and I'll go
ahead in the wig that I use for that
I'll give it away to somebody okay so
let me know which I think don't look
like Instagram account though I look
like I got like eight baby daddies I
come up with the corniest quotes and I
got hella issues emotional distress
