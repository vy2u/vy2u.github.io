quickly shower no I'm a vocal bees so
long time no see
and this is actually a wig that I love
to death and believe it or not this was
originally an Italian Yankee wig all
right wake is from April place week and
you guys know that I love me some
April's lace wigs this is a first.we
company that I ever worked with and all
these years later we still rocking - yup
okay so and I'm gonna get closer they
start to kind of see the crow pattern
that's going on here so this was like a
very I was kind of going for how a lot
of like the mixed kids look where their
hair is really just make but I know some
people who are not to be compared is
extremely curly but it's more common
mostly kids
so I'm Kendra Wilkinson sons hair a
little Hank what's the blade was gay
from a menace to allegedly Oh from
honest behavior the main I think the
thing is Princeton or something like
that for see know what his hair was
curly like this too when before he cut
it and I just wanted to do something for
my like natural nieces who are going
through the big chop you guys know I
like natural hair and my hair is natural
I'm not relaxed or anything like that
but I were weak ninety-nine times out of
ten so sometimes I don't always want to
be like long and low E sometimes I do
want to just go for like more of a
natural look that is pretty much
effortless so I opted for this look now
it doesn't look like this similar and
I'm caught in my Rick James but it's
usually been longer at the bottom but I
wanted to do it where it was more of a
unisex look because a lot of guys do
follow my videos and a lot of you guys
asked me can you do more guy hairstyles
or more Universal or unisex hairstyles
are definitely fun so I took some of
these which are just the standard
perm rod with the teeth that goes on the
end like this
and I decided to just wrap the entire
hair all the way through the hair and
then I used a lot of body which I
remember using this in beauty school for
all the oh my all my old head
love y'all good all it said yes and then
I just took a normal water bottle like
such and then I put half a lot of body
have water I kind of put a little more a
lot of body because this hair is what
tanks course so I wanted to make sure
that it was henna traded because this
hair wasn't smooth it was very coarse
because again like I said it originally
was Italian yaki I wanted to make sure
that it was going to stay and as you can
see all baby instead just like my name
was Hattie Mae okay so this was the day
want to actually check it out for the
first time and you can see it's really
curly is very bouncy it just need to
structure but I really enjoyed the look
and how they came out it was very easy
very simple and very to the point which
was the whole entire point of this look
so what I think when I rolled it I'm
sure you guys will see a picture pop up
somewhere around here usually when you
wigs like this and I do this particular
style the whole crown section which is
from here up until here I always do them
back and forth the curls so I'll do the
very front forward down backwards
forward backwards so when I pull it out
it gives me this you don't want it to be
so uniform where it looks like you got
like curly bangs because then it's
really going to start to look like the
Rick James look you want it to look like
you just have some naturally curly hair
and again curl naturally hair has really
no uniform to it it's kind of why gives
you this look because they're all inter
well within each other so that's pretty
much how I did it the back of it I did
everything going pretty much down and
then I cut it was originally let's see I
think it was 20 inches originally when I
got it and I think it was 22 inches now
this is not the classic full lace wigs
that I usually get this is actually a
360 band with the West in the back that
are actually sewn to the cap so there's
a whole 360 cap that it goes all the way
around like a regular wig or you know
what if 360 looks like and then in the
middle they're actually track that are
sewn onto the actual
so I wanted to try something different
and it's actually there so base unit now
the reason why opted for this look is
opposed to anything else because I've
done a lot of Italian yaki and I've done
a lot of look there's a lot more looks I
want to do a lot of more lips there's a
lot more looks I would like to do with
this particular texture the only issue
that I have with this is that they sent
me a medium cap and it doesn't fit so
literally the lace is still on it and it
stops about right here so I couldn't
really put this on like I wanted to show
yeah it doesn't fit me correctly but I
was like okay well I can just kind of
try this method that I've been wanting
to do this for the longest and I just
didn't really want to do it on any
WestEd hair per se just because I don't
really get too much texture hair like I
can do this with some silky hair and be
completely fine but I wanted to give
people an option for the actual entire
yak me to say other well maybe if I do
want to curl it what will it look like
you can curl Italian yes you can make it
looks like so many different things but
I've never seen anybody trust this
particular method not to my knowledge
and I wanted to do something that was
very simple but very easy for everybody
to do I was watched well I was actually
editing a tutorial yesterday and only
this in the last damn work and I
remember when I first wanted to do this
I was like I want to do something where
everybody can do it it's not rocket
science is not complete shaming and
plucking and all these things that goes
into again having a beautiful unit in it
today but I just wanted to get you more
just starting out the option and
especially if you are a person who wants
to do the whole natural look you don't
want to necessarily look like you have a
weave or looking to wear straight hair
because it's not really for your face it
is a friend your patient I'm really good
at could layers this is another option
now it is cannot be here because you
will ignite okay
so I'll get to the specs of all of these
all this greatness that they sent me and
I'll give you my two cents a hospital
about the ways overall okay so we're
going to start off with my color my
color is natural color so it's a 1v
color
I didn't do anything different or new to
it or add any more color or taking you
out so this is what the natural color of
the Shocker look like which is more
Muslim or subacute now if you want to
add color to this you can't you got to
be careful because his hair has been
treated to be Italian yaki so be careful
with the bleach because you can dry the
hair out you don't want that my original
list this was 22 inches and then I cut
it into this like a 20 curled
it's like longer here in the back like
back here is a little bit longer than
the front but it's 22 it was originally
22 start to kind of chop the bottoms up
a little bit just because I wanted to
all be kind of more a little bit rounded
instead of rounded and it along - then
it starts a little more on the female
side and again most guys I know who do
have a lot of hair their pros are never
asymmetrical like that their hair is
usually it's very even all the way
around a cat's eyes or was like I said a
medium I don't know if they change their
cap sizes or what ironer but it's a
little - it's a little too small for me
so I actually would need a large but I
remember originally always wear like
small cap from them so I got that
I only just change their capsized if you
did this particular wig I'm not for sure
I don't know
then actually have it still talked to it
now you can get it without facility' I
personally would suggested without the
still top unless you plan on when you're
here in a specific part in this region
if not just it's less money and yeah
just I would rather not now this is the
almond original - y'all but y'all be
confused although they're doubling down
below this the italian remy hair 316
frontal lace or lace front wig this w is
BW 0 1 8 0 so for pretty much all the
specs that I got you'll be saying my 254
so that's actually not really bad it was
before this weight like this it was like
this has been the best in my personal
opinion for anything Italian Yankee are
related I got other tell ya and it
happening very much like they're pretty
they're not that different but they have
is something different about their here
like they they go above and beyond
make sure that the is coarse enough but
it's also when you do straightening if
you want because you can't string this
here it will bounce back some here don't
always bounce back like that sometimes
once that he hit it if it's like a
French Way responds the shedding goes
with his hair I didn't get not okay no
even after I did this to it I'm not
getting any and I haven't had any
shedding issues ever with any of my lace
wigs wigs like ever even my like yeah I
mean what was it my first one I got was
like a life Chinese and it was straight
you know it was course yes but I didn't
share chorus tangling go no especially
when it's big you can run your fingers
through it in it it's no problem issues
with what that is that at all now I want
my fingers do this
oh I guess I'm talk it's a lot curl
kornél here okay so for all I don't
have issues with that the lace is very
soft too because I got a synthetic wig
the other day for Lyles testing out
something who that lace felt like
somebody laid a brick on my hairline it
was horrible
so this feels very very very nice okay
there is a difference in life I feel
like oh my life is on no hard lace and
softly are completely different because
that's very just cheap lace that feels
like a piece of paper it's going to etch
you all damn day so good lace which I
believe is a Swiss um will do you
something good something great and then
as far as I like the fitting of it I
really can't speak on that because this
one did not fit me but the other ones
that I've had the past that they mean
great and then the hairline is just too
did require some this did have
the very barbie hairline but i didn't
bother with it just because I not wear
like this and when I was wearing it with
the two braids I was leaving some of my
edges out so I was just blending that in
it really didn't
it wasn't inserted so yeah overall I
give them definitely a 9 out of 10 just
because mine didn't fit that was the
only thing it just didn't fit and I got
told them that but I just feel like
again I wanted to show you guys if you
guys run into issues like this and maybe
you brought the hair and got some
radical add on time to send it back but
you gotta wear it well other options
Tito so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video and I hope this helped you and
like I said I just simply use um those
those rods I got some from Sally's
Beauty Supply just look for that color
and then I use a lot of body did happen
I did like 75% in water I let it sit and
then also one thing I want to say to the
Fargo I use a bonnet dryer for this I
did not do I do not let it air dry and
you don't have a bonnet dryer use a blow
dryer this hair will come out a little
bit better and it will last better
because you actually use heat on it if
you let it air for everything put it if
you want our like it's hard to tell
outside putting off out on your balcony
or your front porch it will dry but you
want it to be able to draw into that you
know that nice curl so it will stay like
this because if not what you're going to
end up with is CRO that fall after a
while these curls have been in a pair
for I want a feeling hmm I want to say
almost a month you know like I haven't
did anything to them but keep keep
trimming the damn here and keep cutting
it but that's it I haven't had to redo
that at all so I just did um some
straight hair like that hence why
there's water in a bottle put yeah it
stays just like this and because it's is
herion yaki it's not so easy to drop
it's going to take longer so I don't so
just on a mannequin hand since it
actually just laid on the counter so
that it won't on true you don't want
that so if you guys enjoyed this video
let me know below what hair cell would
you like to see me do I have one common
that is going to change the day so I
hope you guys enjoyed this and I will
catch you guys and my next one all the
links to this wig will be follow pay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
