hair looks a little grainy right now but
it's a reason for this so you guys know
I have loved my Italian yaki wig from
April's lace wigs since I received it
and I have gotten the most questions
about this wig I think ever so this unit
that I'm wearing is actually another
Italian yaki they send me a new one
because my other one happens to be
missing long story so really just skip
it um so I'm gonna go over the specs of
this wig for those who are new here you
may have not seen my other one cuz this
is kind of like my wig that I wear all
the time and you guys looked at my
chunky video I had this way going a few
other videos I've had this wig on and
April's lace wigs was the first company
that ever did a silk top um review on
and the first time I've ever had it up
top and you guys know ever since then I
have been as you can see silk top crazy
so on what I did was I went ahead and
left this I natural and then I went
ahead and flat ironed this side so as
you can see the texture is still the
same
as you can see the texture hasn't
changed much but it's more sleek it
looks more natural like a natural press
um let's just say a little girl who was
probably going to graduation or
something and her mom wants her hair to
look straight for her graduation but she
doesn't want to like Flatiron and she
just wants to press it that's pretty
much what this is given this side
however is still giving me a blow dry
like I just got my hair blow-dry and
this is pretty much what it looks like
so one thing that I will say that I love
about this is that every time I do wear
this wig or anyway gets similar to it
everybody always thinks it's mines
nobody ever eggs all the kind of wig is
that you know it's not like my straight
hair or my curly hair this one has a
very natural look to it so if you are a
person
who wants a wake to run around any you
don't have to like have a lot of
maintenance to it then this is the
perfect look for you especially if you
have a kinkier texture of a hair um what
I did was as you can see this eye lays
really flat cuz this is all straight and
this side is still kind of bulky and
thick because I didn't do anything to
this I literally just brushed it out and
it had like a braid at the bottom talk
when I parted it down the middle I
didn't pull out on his side or press
this side and I didn't even press this I
just flat iron so if I woulda pressed it
it would have been like this like really
super flat like that I had actually
braided this side back and I wish I
woulda did like showed you guys video of
me doing it the only reason why didn't
keep it in is because um my braids are
really old so they don't want to lay it
didn't want to lay down like I really
like slick it and it looked good but I'm
definitely gonna do a video because I
have some stuff I have to do and I need
to braids and I'm not ready for my hair
into braids because I got a couple wigs
on but um I definitely were gonna I'm
gonna do that and then they have tans
down as far as wigs go ever lace wigs
has the best silk top units this is what
the silk top looks like and as you can
see it looks like it coming straight out
of the actual scalp it doesn't look like
there's any holes or anything like that
when it comes down to wigs people some
people are afraid of still tops or our
soup base closures because they always
be like I don't know how to blend the
line of demarcation I'm a little bit on
the more chocolate side so they tend to
come in your complexion so I don't know
what to do but like I always tell you
guys the quickest thing and easiest
thing is you can get some right dye in
the color and a color that's above your
skin tone because remember it's going to
get darker from what it already is so
don't get the exact color of your skin
tone for March um more chocolate people
get more of a tone above it because it's
going to blend and it should be the
exact colour or you can just get some
regular old Lipton tea or regular tea
unsweetened tea brew it let it get cold
and then pour it in a container with the
actual closure or the actual League and
then it's going to tint the color on it
and
it's gonna die and tint this was a
little bit darker than with the original
because remember it's it's still based
or therefore is a fabric it's going to
actually take the color and it's going
to absorb the color if I go like this
you'll see on one side you see how
straight it is on this side and how it
moves and then if I do this too now if I
do this you see how full it is and how
it really doesn't move much it moves but
it's not the same and as you can see
they both move but this one definitely
is much stiffer than this this has a
very natural look to it this just looks
like I'm blow dry but I love April's
last week's I my other Italian Yankee
that I had that's now ma um it was and
still is I haven't seen one of the best
wigs that I've ever worn because I never
ever in my life have somebody actually
is that trying you know they always be
like your hair is really nice it's
really long it's really pretty I just be
like oh thank you a lot and then go
about my day so I'm going to show you
what the inside of the cab looks like so
you guys could understand of what the
silk top is and a difference between
that in the lace part so this is what
the actual parting of it looks like and
as you can see it looks really really
realistic now you see these holes right
here here in a really dark and dense
dough so people's closures normally look
like it should look like this
and then this is what the inside of the
cab looks like so this part is lace this
is just soaked top and then this is the
stretchable panel in the actual wig so
it comes with my last one then come with
this mini combs this actually has four
combs at the bottom and it has two combs
on the sides but there's no combs like
right here but yeah my other one I think
it only had like I think my other one
only had like
two combs at the back and because this
is a very natural style you tend to
brush this often so the extra security
never hurts and then this is the
searchable panel and then has the
adjustable strap right here if you want
to make it tighter or any looser
if you guys are interested in this
particular unit just to make sure you
guys click the link below and you guys
have any questions on what I use to
straighten it I just use my regular
really thick Remington Flatiron and the
orange spray that always uses my
Flatiron spray which is a heat
protectant and it's also a shine I just
use those two together and I did nothing
extra different um then I usually
normally do it's just that I had to make
a way more passes um then I normally
would for straight hair because of
course this hair is much more thick than
any of my straightener ever will be um
but as you can see if I would have
really went in and straighten it really
hard
it would have been pin straight I didn't
want to press it because I didn't want
to take kind of like the natural texture
out and that's pretty much what the
press would have done it would have took
it all the way out so it would have been
like like I said really flat it would
have been like this you know and it
would had this really flat look to it
however that's not what I was trying to
do I just wanted to be something just a
little bit so you can tell the
difference between the two so don't be
afraid to straighten um your Italian
yaki or your kinky a key or whatever
people are classifying it is the
textured hair it's been so many names
but don't be afraid to do it because
you'll be able to see the difference you
know and you can wear it like you could
probably do this and then put it in the
bun because I was able to do this and
then actually braid it and slick my hair
until it and it actually very natural it
didn't look too straight like I had
heard you know so if you guys are
interested make sure you guys hit
April's lace wigs down below and um tell
me what you want to see like tell me
because you know they have this color is
not they have this texture and like 6:13
or something close to it look like a
blonde : so if I were to take that into
like a red on it or a blue in this
texture though it would have been like
very Shana from Jim Jim and Holograms
like a purple that's the only purple I
would do honestly because that is
actually really pretty it was like a
lavender but anyway um again if you guys
are interested in this or if you guys
want to see me do braids
with this there are a lot of people's
like I want to see you do like a high
ponytail or braid or something like that
put it down below because I'm definitely
looking for more options than just me
wearing it in a middle part or a side
part um when it comes down to this hair
so yeah no color though cuz this hair is
really that's the only thing is that
because of the texture it's easy to dry
out because of if you put bleach on it
so I definitely wouldn't do that however
anything goes totally down so I will
catch you guys in the next one
