nuts
fYI oh don't look at my phone okay so
today I'm going to do a review on this
beautiful wig I have on and I'm you guys
are thinking like bitch you lyin just
that's it's a wig like legitimately this
is wig um it is a silk top lace wig that
I got from April lace wigs which I
believe used to be called lace wig front
calm and I think if you could go to that
domain and still it will redirect you to
the site but they contacted me after I
had did um one of my hair reviews and
asked me did I want to do a review and I
said sure and they actually um sent the
wig of via DHL and was expressed so it
came within like three days from China
and I believe that they should have
everybody stuff like that I'm not sure
so don't quote me but from my
understanding they do um and this is a
again a silk top and I have a Chinese
virgin so basically it's Chinese hair
but it's it's a virgin but it's light
yaki so that means that it's virgin hair
but it's been processed to make to give
it like a yaki texture now on camera
it's coming off real silky but it is
let's get a little closer it is a it is
a a yaki texture you probably just can't
tell um it's a color 1b the hair texture
is of course a light yah here's a small
kappa so glueless full lace wig with the
still top and the silk top means i'm
gonna just give you an example here a
silk top means basically there is no
lace so as you can see here it looks
like a real scalp and it's a four by
four so that means that for four inches
across and four inches down it's
actually soaked instead of lace and the
reason why I don't like closures you
guys know I tried them
and I did inform from many companies and
the reason why I don't like them is just
because they just don't come off natural
they always look like a leader a
lace-front already always look like you
know they just don't look like a natural
like a natural scalp or whatever so with
the sub-base it looks like real scalp
growing out of your hair so it's easier
to fake when you put it right on your
hairline it just looks like I parted my
hair all the way back and nobody could
tell now I do have it behind my hairline
so my baby hairs and stuff up here are a
little fun ever now but um yeah I do
have it a little bit behind my hairline
because I hate when it has that I just
hate that lace wig look it just pisses
me off now if you guys all watched my
short film whiskey girls in the second
episode my hair was just like this and I
mean just like this but okay this is the
footage from the whiskey girls and as
you can see uh literally this is like
the same hair the same style and
everything the only difference is my
part is on the opposite side of my head
as it is now but yeah it's the exact
same how to weave at the time so the
fact that I could really like fake it in
with this wig and give me the same
result and I did this and like half the
time I'm all freaking for it um it's
really light it's 24 inches so it's
really long it's 24 inches and all the
hair is pulled to the front so this is
all the hair um and that's kind of the
thing that come as a downfall that I
don't like about it is you guys know I'm
four bundles or more type of person so
the fact that it's a little on the thin
side as far as you know what I like now
anybody else for the average person this
will be more than enough hair but for me
because I do like to put in more hair
and I like my hair really full um it's
great it looks great straight I don't
know how I would look if I curled it
being the fact that it's not a super
duper full but it is it is full though
it doesn't feel like I got on the same
wig it is full and the fact that is the
yaki texture does help the layers that I
I've in this wig as you can see here
we're not in it when I got it when I got
it it was very Morticia Addams
it was just like straight like bone
straight which I love so I did these are
layers last night matter of fact before
I even tried to do this review because I
didn't want to do the review while the
wig was just straight like that
I didn't want look like cousin ed so
yeah I just put some light layers here
in the front or whatever and I was it
everything else is just pretty much
still the same and the reason why I did
that is because when you get like a wig
or or even a weave for that matter if
you don't cut it right and it doesn't
frame your face right it's not going to
look natural I could walk down the
street and nobody would know you know
because my regular hair when I get my
wig is done looks just like this like
legitimately just like this um so I mean
it just really depends on the person I
mean what your hair is like the silk top
is a little bit darker than my actual
sky my scalp is just really really light
and I think it's because I have a really
bad dandruff but um the quick fix to
that would be just to get some concealer
and put the concealer on and even
sometimes it shift and I just pull it
like this and you know it kind of goes
back into place like it's supposed to
um I've been out so and it's hot so and
I got Indian flutter so my edges ain't
like they should be only because I've
been playing and combing my hair for
like the last 30 minutes but other than
that though I really like it like I love
it when I got it it came in this box I'm
I have on a stocking cap and it came
with two stocking caps um this is what
the other one looks like um that's up
underneath here so if I do part it
anywhere in the back you'll see this and
not just like black hair from my braids
um in the middle it came you know with
this in the middle of it and it kind of
gave it that bump right here that I
didn't like so what I did was I took the
flat irons and I just basically closed
them to the sides and kind of went over
it to flatten everything out and as I
kept doing it
put a little hairspray um as well just
to kind of get it to lay down I don't
like to use water because water once it
dries it kind of pops back up and then
the whole entire week within this long
a stick bag oh man I got it so yeah I
don't have any issues with it it's
straight and great
and I noticed that like when I first got
it you can see the yaki real good when I
first got it and I was kind of scared
like man it's just you know like I know
it supposed to be like Jackie but I'm so
used to silky hair I don't know how this
is gonna you know like I was gonna work
so it actually when I flat ironed it the
you can still see it like you can still
see the yaki texture I mean it's coming
off on camera real freaking silky but
you can still okay you can see it a
little there you can still see that it's
yaki but it's not like it was when I
first first got it where it was just
like you know Ripple like it looked like
ocean but I mean that's good because
that's the look that you're going for so
this actually does look like I pressed
and flat iron my hair and I was done so
yeah as you can see the silk top is
right here and all my hair is under it
so just find like a open space and plop
it down my part is a little jacked up to
again I've been out all day so yeah
everybody's been giving me compliments
like your hair looks so nice you're
hearing so pretty and they don't even
know it's a wig so if you are interested
please click the link at below and take
a look at their wigs I think this week
is two to something and this is where I
mean I may just advise you cuz I get a
lot of questions about what people
should do while they're trying to grow
their hair back this is a great option
if you had like a short cut and your
short cut is looking kind of janky or
it's in that in-between stage where it
just don't look right and I'm saying
like it's it's just and that awkward
stage where just doesn't look right this
is definitely an option it's wrong cuz
one you have to do is leave out your
edges and not even a lot because my
edges are not left out is just this part
that's out um so you can pretty much do
that if you don't want I mean it's an
investment of course but at the same
time it's gonna save your hair if you
don't want to go but you still want to
have the style of your natural shout out
to all my natural girls but if you are
natural and you still want that look or
whatever you can actually do it and have
it with no problem
I'm
this later because I am really tripping
and I think I'm just being really picky
right now but yeah um I think that's a
lot to say about it thank you to the
company for sending me the way because I
really really loved it I might throw
some color in it I don't know I'm so
over ombre so I'm not gonna do that but
I might actually die like a cook or
something I don't know but we'll see
nobody is gonna say blood cuz you know
I'm just I'm a straight black hair type
of person um although I've been weren't
crows lately but i'ma see how it takes
to a curling come back and let you guys
know in a later video how I was holding
up or whatever but yeah this is
everything I love this this is
definitely everything um I hope you guys
enjoyed this and please hit me up and
which comments at the bottom and let me
know how you like this review and I
would talk to y'all later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
