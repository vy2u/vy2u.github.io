like relationships and date ships
whatever you want to call it so yeah I
recently had a bit of an issue with
someone pretty much asking me to be okay
with being treated like and you
know and I don't say well I think
treated like like they didn't get
away with nothing
that's why we had problems oh but let me
just kind of put it out there so I have
a friend who's literally my friend he's
that's all we ever been his friends but
he really likes me and um we I've been
on him for like four years or whatever
business out there a little bit but he
likes me a lot
and we tend to buy gifts for one another
like and he's weird I think he's a year
older to me um but he's a producer or
whatever and he tends to you know see
things out that he likes that I think
I'll like and him but do you want this
and I blog it and I did a very same for
him but we're not in a relationship
because he travels and all that good
stuff and then you know I'm based here
in Los Angeles we I know what type of
duty is okay and I'm one of those people
I'm gonna try to change who you are to
accommodate myself so therefore I'm just
gonna leave my business
where it is and I'm gonna let you do you
and friends is the only thing that I see
fit for him and I when I've had a
boyfriend he's always been respectful to
that we've kissed one time and we was
drunk we was at a concert but other than
that he really wants to like be with me
or whatever and I don't want to be ma'am
I just think he's a really cool person
because we vibe it's like having a
boyfriend when I don't have a boyfriend
without the sex
that's pretty much what it is but so
he's kin that I've already spoke as his
middle name is Kenny so it makes sense
but yeah we have been very very close
for a number of years and someone that I
guess they were interested in me or
whatever the situation is I had seen
that I have posted something else to me
it's just a little um I don't take it
serious because we go back and forth and
we banter back and forth we just
ignorant and our text messages but he is
somebody that I hold very close to my
heart because he has a very good heart
he's a very good person so long
story short a person that was interested
in me and we were like talking or
whatever the situation is got kind of
upset because I post that on Instagram
and I've been doing it before I met him
and I'm gonna do it after him like you
can't tell me what the I can't like
there's a lot of things that we could
talk about but that ain't one of them
you don't like it don't do with it so he
felt some type of way about it but then
he was doing all his little dessert and
all his little stuff and I didn't say
anything I was just like I just don't
want to hear about it and that's what
you're doing because I'm not one for
cheating like I'm very very big on being
faithful to the person that I'm with if
I'm with you when I'm riding with you
and I'm taking our time of my
 day because he at the end
of the day this is the thing we don't
have to with each other you have to
talk to me and I don't have to talk to
you we are both adults and we are both
making choices right now so we're gonna
make choices to entertain one another
then let's respect one another I'm not
gonna say that I want one thing in and
I'm turning around and I'm talking to
old dude like I'm not I'm just not that
bitch you know and I'm not I'm just I'm
not insecure
I'm just very stingy with the person
that I'm with in their time so this
particular person decided a you know he
wanted to still do what he was doing and
all this good stuff and I was you know
bitch like me be like alright well what
it is I don't give a like it's that
simple
and I guess he's accustomed to the way
that he handles people when he's with
them cuz they think he's a God and I
guess he just has his godlike complex I
don't know nor do I give a but I
guess I was supposed to accept what was
going on and y'all know me y'all though
I'm just not wired like that so um there
was a lot of four-letter words and there
was a lot of things because you're
getting mad at me for doing the very
same thing that you do hypocrite you are
so that's what brought me to this
situation um when it comes down to
dating I'm very very if I'm if I take
out the time again to get to know you
know that my time is precious and yours
is as well because you can never get it
back so respect me and we respect what
the I'm saying to you and if I
don't like something I would rather tell
you didn't with Leroy on the side
because you ain't acting right I'm just
not that person if I don't want to be
with you I'm gonna tell you this
don't work I'm not gonna with you
how people up with me is that I'll
give them ultimatums like that they
don't take them and then they turn
around and they dude they do the very
thing I didn't want you to do don't
cheat if you don't want to be with the
person just tell them the thing for you
and move the one you know but a
lot of people settle a lot of people be
cool with that like oh you know he know
where home is that when I hear girls say
well I'm always gonna be number one he
took what these look no no no pause
bitch skirt no because that means that
you don't give a about yourself
because you're allowing him you are
allowing him to do what he think is OK
and what I say allow a person is gonna
do what they want to do regardless of
what you or anyone else says but if
you're allowing them to do it in your
presence and to you emotionally
physically or whatever else then you're
the dumbass because it has been a lot of
dudes who will hunt me down they want to
get to know me so bad they gets
they like the idea of me but then when I
start laying down that law you're not
gonna do this you're not gonna do that
you're not gonna be texting bitches
you're not gonna be like that doesn't
work for me and let me tell you I'm a
pretty okay bitch I don't get what
niggas look like with them you gotta
have a beams up you gotta have a car you
gotta have some money you got to get
this done you gotta get my hair yeah I
don't care cuz I got my own that's not
my issue but it'd be simple y'all
simple like don't cheat don't be
texting behind my back don't you know
it's just little that it seems like
today people have an issue with actually
doing social media I will give it this
much of a blame because you're so
accessible to these people now he's a
bitch don't like pictures three
times now you and addy I'm talking about
what's good and it's normal that's
normal
no I'm not that normal I don't go for
the okey-doke I don't go further that's
the way it is I don't go I got I don't
got a deal with
so I give people the benefit of the
doubt if I feel like you made a mistake
all is forgiven
you know and when I say mistake I mean
something like Texan another bitch or
you know entertaining somebody a little
more than you should've but cheating
that's not a mistake that's that's
conscious effort you did you took off
your clothes
and you had intercourse with somebody
that is not an accident
people who do things to you like this
especially when you love them they don't
love you because people who really love
you wouldn't ever do anything like that
don't you but usually them are usually
the ones that hurt you the most because
they have the most reign over your
feelings when you give your heart to
somebody you allow them to break it
remember that so now today you know the
thing is you know I'm number one I'm a
side bitch I don't want anything for him
I know he got a girlfriend I know you
know and it's because a lot of these
ladies and gentlemen they don't really
value their self or their opinions or
how they feel about themselves so for
you to say you to pay second fiddle to
someone it's wife okay it says a lot
about you as a person if you are a wife
and you're playing second fiddle but he
calls you number one because you cooking
and cleaning and bringing the kids home
Robbie should be okay with that okay
listen I'm down and Sharon is definitely
caring but not my man and not my drawers
my clothes shoes or anything else you
can't even drive my car bitch so why
would I let you have reign over someone
like that and when I say let you why
would I tell him that that's okay this
is the way it is just like young jock on
Lebanon pop he's with this bitch
and he's with this bitch and
women know so now you're fighting her
because of his actions
I'm not fighting no bitch nor nigga for
nothing that's not gonna happen if he's
been at your house all the time
he calls yo ass and he's texting you
that's your nigga good okay you need
taken from me
he was returned to you okay that's what
the was he was returned okay you
can have him you keep the receipt I just
don't feel that it's okay for this
society in this generation to just be
okay with sleeping with whomever and you
are saying sure and love not a side
chick pregnant in all boy please I wish
a bitch would because I'm not gonna not
her in the mouth I'm not gonna knock him
in the mouth I'm gonna knock yo ass in
the mouth so I seen this video on
Facebook the other day and one of our
Facebook friends has shared it
it's some little gay dude and he's
laying down and his boyfriend's kissing
all on him and he's running down to
things that his boyfriend is not to you
he's not sure nigga he's my nigga he's
always it was very mature
it was very tacky you guys know me I do
not put my relationship status or who
I'm with on social media and it's for
that very reason you give that doggie
bitch
that nasty nigga and all these other
 rained to try to tear
apart your relationship now you may be
strong as a to withstand
the but he may be or she may be
very incident raishin you know all this
newfound attention that they're getting
they're gonna like which eventually
tears up your situation but when
everything dies down they always come
back talking about they was wrong I
don't know about that you should
have thought about that before you did
it you dumb bitch no I do not want you
you go over there okay because you are
now there nigga not mines so when it
comes down to stuff like that and we
especially in the gay community because
we are known to be promiscuous and all
this other out listen I'm a lot of
things bitch but a whole is not one of
them okay my walls touch you know that
so I don't understand why people sit
back and think that this is okay
you don't saying this is oh well I have
to go out here and let these bitches
know that this is my no you should never
have to let another know
your man should be letting that bitch
know that he's with you or she should
she's with you and you have to go and
say that out of your own mouth then
he wants to be with him she wants to be
with them and you need to find somebody
else to get with oh it's
out there who will go by the simple
these are simple rules though I'm not
asking you to buy me a yacht I just say
can you get the Bentley that I want
brought me my dream house I would love
for somebody to but if you're coming
with the on the side I'm not
gonna do that
I've had opportunities but I'm not gonna
do that because I'm not gonna play
second fiddle because in public you have
a wife and kids and then I'm over here
lavish living in Malibu and my mansion
by myself if that's gonna be the
situation bitch I'm gonna get it myself
because I'm not gonna do that for a
come-up because he don't want to be
honest about who he is or what he's
doing and who he's doing it with see
y'all settle I'm not a subtle anti bitch
if you can't do what I asked you to do
in the means in which I actually should
do it I
not to with you that's simple me
sometime is gonna save you some time and
we're gonna be just fine okay it's that
simple
so again do not settle for a
 because they want to say
that you're not worth it if a man or a
woman is not willing to respect you and
respect your wishes then you need not to
be with them trust me honey there are
plenty of fish in the sea when I find
out before being cheated on and they go
back I'm like it's so many
in a word that you could be winning you
over here worried about his old crusty
dusty no future have an
ass the penis must be wonderful darling
because you I'm just saying because I
never nor am I never gonna fight get my
hair pulled socked in the face get a
possible black eye mess up my beautiful
skin for a dude so all you chicks may be
out here stomping each other out over a
nigger bitch listen I ain't the one
and then you got the people out here who
are just humming and hooking for furry
their bitches are you would day out here
showing titties ass dicks and everything
else for our life imagine what they
gonna do for some money that isn't who
you want to be with you know so make
sure you keep your morals about who you
are as a person while you're out here
trying to date and trying to find the
one make sure you do that because before
you know what you're gonna end up being
the other one the side one the under-12
or the need for one you just know that's
not how life should be set up and that's
not your your happiness should
definitely not be based on if somebody
wants to be faithful to you that day or
not you know so on that note
i'ma go but ladies and gentlemen don't
settle for somebody especially somebody
who ain't</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
