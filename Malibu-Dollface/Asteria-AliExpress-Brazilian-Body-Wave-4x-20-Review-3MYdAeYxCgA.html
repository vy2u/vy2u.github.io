doesn't know what's an egg will drain
you hi guys so today I'm going to review
this hair that I'm currently wearing I
thought a mom like what I like this um I
like she look like my mom um but this
hair that I'm having right now is from a
Alex press company called a stereo we
can get our mouth okay
let's do that again this moment is Alex
price hair you guys know I'm still
trying to find that diamond in a rough
at Aliexpress and this hair is from a
company called I think it's a steer your
hair if I'm not mistaken I'm not really
sure how to say the name but I'll put up
the information below um for you know
all the info you guys not just go um but
I do want to come and talk about this
because one I'm very short and usually
when my hair short I usually have a bob
clear this is not a bob I did have my
hair like this however a couple of years
ago I might have been a year ago um I
had longer hair from a different company
and I did this this similar look but not
exactly this um I have a closure in from
closure stores that still base closure
um this is these are the same closures
that I use for everything when I use a I
was a black hair but I did it on my gray
hair too so um this closure is from
closure store now the hair it was a body
wave texture when I received it I have
four bundles of 20 inch and you guys
know I'm really a person who really
stands clear for very short hair like
this I was watching Royal must die you
guys know Lilia so um in the scene when
the Leah's in her bedroom and she she
has this exact style for the rest of the
movie had my fibers where was long but
his my sideburns are very long she had
like a piece of hair but my sideburns
are really long I decided to go ahead
and put it back up in there where belong
cuz it's gonna be everywhere um I did
not have ever straighten his hair when I
received it what I did was I just went
through and I could like a little layer
in the front here and I put a little
err um on a side here and then I was it
and then arrested is I just look because
I don't want to cut too much off it is
four bundles but it is short so what I
didn't want to do is I didn't want to
end up with um just a thin short like
was gonna end up being the Bob I'm sorry
I've been not to do that I don't know if
I always say this but this is just for
those who are new here I do not were so
ends at all I wear only wigs this is a
wig I made it on a dome cap um I have a
video on how to do so I'll put that
below as well and that's pretty much
what it was I mean it didn't take much I
did the dwegon about an hour and it was
cool the hair texture is nice it's soft
they said that this is virgin brazilian
body wave and this seems to be like a
hot seller among Aliexpress because when
I am contacted for reviews this is the
one thing that they want to send you
body wave when it's in you buy I'm so
sick of body wave hair um but this hair
was actually very very very nice
especially for the price I have again I
have four bundles in um this also I want
to say that when I did receive the hair
and have the classic you know body wave
you know what it looks like on the
picture when you click on the link below
um but when I smell the hair oh it's
smell of a hint of relaxer is what I'm
smelling and I know it relaxer smells
like okay guys I've been a beauty school
I know exactly where relaxers most like
um not for sure if that's what it was
but it was some type of chemical that I
did smell on the hair um so that pretty
much is my cue to say that it's not
virgin hair
it's nice hair I wouldn't say that it
was virgin hair though but it is nice
but for the price I would say it might
actually be worth it now I've had this
hair for about a month now and in that
month this hair has given me no problems
when I initially put it in it did
quite a bit um and then after I put it
in it kept shedding and I was like okay
so this this is gonna be some crap hair
but as of now it's been okay and it's 30
days after I've received the hair I've
had this hair for it's been a minute
y'all thank you to the company being
very patient because they know I was
doing a video that May and then all that
stuff happened with the living hip-hop
so they were very patient and waiting
for this review to go up so um I
personally think for the bundles that I
received um it was very easy to curl
very very easy to curl it holds a very
good curl these curls that wall these
waves that I have in because they was
girls um are from about a week and some
change ago is when I had record it after
I first started wearing it and then I
took it off and then I just been putting
it on like running like literally doing
this and then going about my day and
then it last y'all know I use some of
this Garnier Fructis this is the full
control humidity hairspray when I curl I
use a little bit of this and it's pretty
pretty much holds my curls I know
recently I did a um a video about
another company but I was wearing
another company's hair and I had a hat
on and I have these waves those ways
that were in that hair were in the hair
for about a good like two weeks I think
so like I hadn't recurred the hair at
all
so that stuff really does work so that's
what pretty much is keeping these curls
to stay like this in this bang piece to
stay like this
um again only cut a little bit of peace
here in the front so that it wouldn't
just be a whole bang it actually you
know what hi back here and I could do
this and all that good stuff but I do
like it it's very demure it's very
natural-looking it's very like you know
not my 24 inch down my butt but it is
good to have options and I understand
that all of you guys to watch are not
into the very long stripper hair like I
am into so I want forty inches now so
let's just say um out of 10 I would give
this hair a nice seven um because of the
smell and because of the shedding that's
why I don't think that it's like the
greatest hair in the world but because
the prices that they're selling it for I
would say if you're looking for some
quick hair really quick I would say go
for it I don't really think it would be
that much of a waste of money to get it
but as far as it being actually virgin
brazilian hair i don't think so because
when i smelled definitely smell like
some type of chemical so i hope that you
guys enjoyed this and I will talk to you
and then
