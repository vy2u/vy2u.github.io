head it is really bad bow-bow-bow say um
this hair that I'm wearing is from a
Styria hair and you guys know that I
have review for them once before and the
look that I did was this look this is
new hair that I'm rocking right now this
is their Peruvian body wave and I have a
subways closure from closure store in
right now
there should be a photo of what this
hair looked like when I originally
received it here um and it was just a
natural uh well I would say natural
because the natural body wave here don't
really look like that but it has that
plastic will we know it be a body wave
look and I went ahead and added some
color at the bottom which I personally
can't see it's supposed to be red but I
used I use this color my hair don't look
nowhere near this color I don't know
what's going on but it didn't really
take the color very well my sister says
she can tell what I can so maybe a
little bit
it ain't discolored oh I know that for a
fact my hair don't look close to this
but whatever I went ahead and curled it
and I curled a very loosely kind of like
just everywhere and then I was that
eventually I'm just gonna run through
with the comb I'm gonna run it through
this and then just kind of break them up
eventually but I just wanted a little
bit of body a little bit of so it curled
great I'll put it back here yeah
but it curled great curl really pretty
as you can see these have been in for
two days I have a tendency to not really
put a lot of effort into curls because
they are they're gonna fall eventually I
mean that's just the name of the game
but this is three bundles which is very
natural and I believe my last up hair
that they sent me was three bundles is
wet my hair is very normal it's kind of
very oh it's cute you know like this is
what most of y'all I'm sure wear your
hair like this you know this is the
everyday person I'm not that person but
Asteria hair my other hair is still
holding up very well too um one thing
that I did I will have to say about this
hair is that the smell was it not
exactly to my liking
it had this processed smell and um am I
going to insinuate that this process but
I am going to say that it did have the
reminiscent of that type of smell arm
but it did curl it didn't stink anymore
after I washed it and whenever I have
hair get hair that smells like corn
chips or this is not like corn chips but
it smells like that or anything like it
I wash it with fabric softener then I
wash it like regularly and shampoo Laden
you know conditioning then I roll on it
but that's the only thing that I really
didn't like was the fact that it had
that a little bit of an odor to it that
I was in a serving pleased about but
aside from that and the little bit of
shedding but the thing about shedding
with me is that I can deal with it as
long as it's not crazy you know cuz hair
sheds your hair so it's not like if
you're looking for some hair that
doesn't shed you're kind of looking for
a leprechaun because it all um but
it really goes down to wishes we're sure
it's more and what sheds less um from a
scale of one to ten with this particular
hair I would give it like a 7.5
um and the reason why I won't give it an
8 is because one of my bundles um I
think it was the top bundle but um yeah
the hair is not very long and the
bundles are not very thick so it does
give you a natural look like I have here
but you know behind me I have here in
front of me and it doesn't look super
duper thin it just looks very normal
um but my top bundle back to my point my
top bundle um the stitching and I
believe these are machine tied not hand
tied so when you do get hands high web
sometimes they do come a loose machine
should never come loose but they were
the threading was a little bit loose so
that's kind of the thing that I didn't
necessarily like which I'm sure why I
kind of got a lot of shedding um but if
I have to compare this to my other hair
I would say I like my other hair better
and they said this was a better grade of
hair than the other hair that I was sent
however I feel like I like the other
hair better
I don't know why um I didn't get any
shedding with that hair was a little bit
different
no I don't know I'm I'm not crazy about
it I don't hate it
um it's just not my favorite you know
it's great for styling though it's style
like a dream you know the curls stayed
in the color is great the luster is
great um you guys seen the pictures of
it when I first received they were very
shiny and very pretty when I first
received it so it's not really that I
think kind of what it is is I was
wanting something to WoW me with this
and it kind of just made me go hmm it's
nice it's kind of a like Erin hair you
know I don't really think I would if I
was trying to do something this would be
the hair that I would go to however um
by no means is it bad I just didn't like
this mode smell was the main thing that
really turned me off of it was
definitely the smell because it was very
pungent um and it wasn't it wasn't to
the point where I couldn't deal with it
but it was to the point where I had to
wash it and y'all know I really like the
co wash my hair before I put it now I
like to put it in as it said go wash it
after a while and then see how it acts
so I don't know what do you guys think
let me know below I'm again this from a
steer hair this okay this is all realism
that we're giving here all the
naturalness with this particular lip but
I want to thank the company for sending
me more hair and yeah guys have any
questions they flick with the blow and
um well that's all probably Allah is a
