because I had a conversation with my
friend and she had just broke over her
she could I could talk about this
she said she broke over her boyfriend
and she said he broke over her because
she's not perfect which is some
but it got us to talking and you know
people today seem to be in search of
perfection everybody wants to be perfect
listen even Barbie got flaws and she's
about as close to perfect as anyone's
gonna get people get all this surgery to
look perfect some people you know they
go yeah kylie jenner with my lips now
trying to look perfect because you know
our insecurities and things that she had
about herself and that's fine play in
the real world no matter what you do as
a person there's gonna be someone who
does not like you everybody wants to be
liked and want to be perfect they want
to try to put on this like they
just everything and nothing is wrong
with them and nothing bothers them and
you just come off false and just whack
um
somebody told me just a long long time
ago and it stuck with me ever since you
can be the juiciest sweetest most
righteous peach in the patch there's
gonna be somebody in this world who does
not like peaches so understand that some
people are on this this world path to be
this most perfect person they can be but
in actuality that perfection is not
something that is tangible it's just
like what people get plastic surgery
they will find something that they
really dislike about their selves and
they'll fix it but then once they fix it
usually they'll find something else
that's wrong and it just becomes this
pattern of trying to fix what's not
really wrong with you most people's
insecurities and their problems and
trying to achieve perfection come from
other people so it's like somebody
saying your lips are too big you
wouldn't really say that your lips were
too big if you were not hearing it from
other people you would just be like oh
this is just how I am and I like my lips
like they don't bother me other people
come and they say something then it
starts to start ticking in people's
minds and they start thinking like well
is there something wrong with me like
should I fix it I've been through that
before too you know I'm saying like I've
had those
shoes where people have said things
about me and I just kind of think like
like are they telling the truth like is
that but then you have the thing look at
the person that it's coming from look at
this old mangle eat a key mildew bitch
put on one nothing better than to just
get on somebody's nerves and make them
feel just as insecure as they feel
because somebody else did it you know
it's true hard people who do hurt people
that's that's just the truth it all
comes down to your confidence and what
you like about yourself because
perfection is measured differently for
everybody and different type of
situations I find myself to be very much
perfect and how I feel about myself and
how I look there are things about myself
that I would like to change
I would love a lip product and that
would be just great however why kids are
sucking into shot glasses I was born
with him so I shouldn't do that I will
with my friend when she got her nose
done and she really wanted it done and
she said because she felt like it was my
hair is secure and she got it done and
she doesn't want anything else done but
we went to our consultation and I talked
to her doctor and I was like what could
I do to make my lips smaller
you know besides makeup besides lining
them and trying to you know put more
color and what what could I do
he was like well you know you could get
a little reduction it will make your
your mouth appear much smaller but I'm
not gonna do it and when a doctor
usually refuses a client for reasons
that are like this and they let you know
that he's a good doctor he did a
terrific job on her nose but he said I
wouldn't do that because I do the
opposite procedure on a regular basis of
lick lip augmentations whether it be
Restylane whatever the situation is I do
that procedure on so many people and you
have something that a lot of other
people want I just wouldn't feel
comfortable with taking out something
that I'm usually putting in so after
hearing that from a doctor I was like
okay so I'm just gonna go ahead and keep
them being you know but I never had an
issue with my lips personally it was
other people who were make comments that
I'd be like that's not nice you know but
now look it's all the rage I remember
coming up in
having big lips was just not the thing
to do but now everybody named my
mama or over drawing their lips over
lining a lips to get what I have
naturally so you know just like back in
the day when girls used to wear pants
and they should say a big butt is so
tacky and it's not cute and everybody
was trying to wear jeans that flattened
their ass
now everybody near mama is out here
getting ass shots fix-a-flat booty pads
and all the types of other inserted
into their ass to have which once was
look at something as ugly
so again profession again is measured
differently so some of the women in the
men who have big lips or big butts or
whatever the situation that I was not
attractive now is the hottest trend and
they're selling these things these
little sucker things that you just you
suck your lips into and they make your
lips bigger and you can line them
somewhere then go down and still appear
to be bigger people are doing this they
say ass augmentation is more common now
than breast implants which is crazy
because there were every chicken in the
world one in breast implants and now
every bitch wants a booty look like
Nicki Minaj is and J Lo's so again if
these women would have went and had
surgeries to take away what wasn't that
what it's now hot they would be trying
to put something back they originally
had that's why when you get with a
boyfriend you get what a man or you get
with a girlfriend you have this person
has to love you for who you are and not
want you to change who you are to
accommodate them so if you're with
someone and they like well I don't like
your hair like this and I don't like
your lips like this and I don't like
your body like this you should get some
breast implants with your titties too
little or you should get your ass
plumped up because it's ooh that's
not the person you should be with
because the man or woman who you're with
is gonna love you regardless for who you
are they should love you for your heart
and your mind not your body okay it's
nice okay I like having this flat flat
stomach and you know people that I've
dated have appreciated it but if I had a
good I would still be the same person I
was just a pure different so stop trying
to be perfect especially for the wrong
people there are so many people out here
who go out here and get all the surgery
to accommodate someone else and they
forget about their self so don't do that
to yourself
it's because it saddens me to see people
who
such so hate not because they feel like
that but because the world has made them
feel like that we you know behind their
 in what they think beauty is
nudey is what you make it
beauty is how you feel about yourself
okay so if you feel good about your
natural hair then you wear your
 natural hair if you feel
good about our 30-inch weave
then you wear your 30-inch
weave okay that's that's because it's
for you you have to sleep with it you
have to live with it
you have to look yourself in the mirror
these bitches out here can't stand their
self they're out here trying to look
like this bitch sing like this bitch act
like this bitch and date like this bitch
and they still at home being the same
raggedy-ass bitch they been since a
 started trying to be the
next bitch that ain't what you want
that's not life so live your life for
what the you want to do how you
want to do it and the way you want to do
it you'll be a much happier person
because trust me I am their that is
said about me to me around me and
reference about me all over the internet
whether it be bad or good at the end of
the day I still have to live with myself
and I still have to live in my truth and
my truth is just who the I am if
you don't like it that's your problem
bitch okay again that's what you don't
like that falls into the
category of your problems not mines so
treat the world like you don't give a
 it really just don't give a
because it's gonna make you a happier
person and stop trying to achieve some
profession is boring it is very much
boring
I think brandi is one of the most
beautiful women in the industry okay and
people there are other people who feel
like brandi is really ugly and she looks
like an alien that's what that's that's
that's you see what I'm saying
so what I feel about her versus what
somebody else feel about her really
wouldn't matter to her if you get what
I'm saying
so it's all in how you identify yourself
again you're not gonna be like you're
not gonna be loved you're not gonna be
called beautiful by everybody there's
some people I think that Lauren London
is ugly I think she's beautiful but
people that way
they're other who find the
girl play Katniss I forget her name
Jennifer Jennifer that she is very weird
looking to me and I don't find her to be
a little bit attractive at all but there
are people oh my gosh she's gorgeous
so it depends some dudes think that
Naomi Campbell is beautiful some dude
thinks she's ugly and fine Halle Berry
to be the most beautiful person in the
world I don't understand the hype behind
 Denzel Washington
especially after that fight however
that's how my granny think he's one of
the finest men who ever walked the earth
so there you go it's all in how you see
you how you love you how you appreciate
you and you learn to embrace the things
that you don't like about yourself then
you'll be a much happier person stop
trying to hide behind things that you
don't like and just say listen he's my
big ass flips I'm not gonna put on the
mask I'm not gonna look like sub-zero
it's gonna be what it is and there's
gonna be somebody who's gonna love you
not only for the fact that you embrace
which you don't like but because you
accept and you show off and you flutter
you're confident about the fact that you
are not perfect so I hope you guys took
something from this and I hope that you
guys start to look at yourself as
beautiful no matter what your
nationality is what your sexuality is
what your sexual preference is it
doesn't matter
love you and be happy and your truth and
on that note I will talk to you guys
later
