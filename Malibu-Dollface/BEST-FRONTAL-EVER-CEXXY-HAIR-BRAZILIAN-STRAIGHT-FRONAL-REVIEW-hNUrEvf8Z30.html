saw your boy they go to the people of
the chosen ones okay okay oh this hair
in this frontal girl the check those
edges all yeah
there's literally as slight as ever and
this hair is actually from sexy hair
I've worked with them once before I
believe once or twice before so I'll try
a new method this frontal is one girl it
is not going anywhere I'm going to show
the message that I use which I'm sure
some people have been using already but
I've just decided to try something new
now one of my favorite me personally one
of my favorite Ali looks is her we added
again look which I'll put here and ever
since I've seen that video she look like
everything and I wanted to do with us
and I didn't have I was gonna do green
screen and I was going to do like just
put a green screen and actually do it
but I couldn't find any actual shots of
the set from the video so blue Singh
like the primary color in that um so I
decided to start my hair just like hers
as close as I could get it and I felt
like I was doing a pretty good job which
I like my intro we have in three bundles
and you guys know I am a nine bundle
type of person but I know that a lot of
you guys are not and the natural look is
what you guys like so this is all the
hair that you get with a frontal and
three bundles which I don't think it's
too bad at all is give you a very
natural look and in the video that's
what that's what it reminded me I
thought after I did it and then I want
to go salad I'm like this definitely
gives me we add it again I think it's
time that we do that intro because you
know I say started intros and I fav
started song
I hear something I'm going to do now
this look that I'm rocking right now
also reminds me you up will I was at you
angle speak for y'all but it rhymes
myself a lot of this look which I did so
I'm gonna stand same post girlfriend
like such the difference between that
that was a frontal but the difference is
I have my edges out here and now there's
the same style a literally this is all
the frontal so I'm going to get a
close-up so you guys can see um the
length I guess you can see if you get
real close you can definitely see
there's some lace right there but you
got to be all up in my face fall out
okay um I will say that I love this
frontal I'm not crazy about the hair the
hair is very like nice to me like it's
it's not that is just what I'm used to
it's not nothing new or different or
crazy but I will say that there front so
bleached beautifully and you guys know
I've been using a new bleach to bleach
my frontal so that's also been a lot of
help to me like I just felt like I've
had to revamp a lot of stuff that I was
doing to make it to the next level I was
getting a little bored and usually when
I get bored it means that hey it's time
to change something so yeah I'm obsessed
with this look like I'm loving this is
my everyday look I love how like
realistic this look I have no hair out
like at all none like not as more so
this side marinade mine's like none of
this is mine and this front slit came
pre plucked which I am obsessed with and
I went ahead and modified it and that
did the whole thing too but it didn't
take much you know and I tried a new
method for the baby hair aspect of it to
make it a little bit make it look a
little bit more realistic and it
definitely came out to my my liking and
my makeup too you know it's just like
very effortless and I feel like this is
a you know everyday look but when I did
go out for dudes hit on me for dudes in
the span of one hour okay and usually
when I'm like dogs up I
it hit on but not like that so I guess
less is more you know just saying as far
as the hair is concerned you know the
luster is cool and because this isn't a
lot of hair I've experienced very low
maintenance as far as trying to upkeep
this so I had to put on for like four
days straight I took it off I just
reviewed another one of my wigs that
I've been in and out which is the middle
part and then I've been calling going in
between the two and then I seen a lady
who lives next door to me and she was
like how do you are your hair so neatly
everyday in these different look how's
the goodness is not my hair not it is as
much she's like I said girl that it
bounced of it it's mine at all their
wigs um and then I showed her my
reliever a braids and she was like oh
wow yeah she would she don't know
nothing about the way game she know
about a lot about that shaking gokane
machine remember that did a full-frontal
game across the board you got you ten
out of ten for me just because the hair
again is nothing that is different from
what I've seen before so my bundles are
an 18 a 20 and a 22 so it has like a
very natural layer and usually what I
want to go for something that's like
very realistic these are the bundles I
usually choose just because it has a
very like I want to be a little bit
extra but I'm not crazy stupid extra
because I got some crazy stupid extra
coming just saying in my front is a 13
by 4 and it is 14 inches so this is like
the natural fall of it if you will like
this is what it does naturally after
hour just simply curl it which is
definitely giving me
awliyas signature bang situation like
such and if you are looking for this
particular look get you a 14 inch
frontal do a deep side part and then
don't cut it if you unless you want to
cut a little bit of this author usually
if you look at like Romeo Must Die
her hair is usually like this and it
kind of went down within a curls that
went this way if I haven't another
bundle it would have been a little bit
fuller so what it kind of looks like the
look at her bedroom but because this was
only three I can only do so much but you
get the gist of what is what because all
I'm about to do with though another
model of a nest yeah
this is the
frontal y'all did that I'm sorry which I
did gather the hell on that so this is a
resilience trait and I believe I'll have
this origin of hair from sexy hair
before I can't remember exactly what my
last ones have been but I will say that
I am obsessed I am totally obsessed with
this look so it's expect to see this
about 10 times demo okay I'm just saying
oh yeah if you guys are interested in
this hair and like I said um the Front's
will came free plus and then I modified
it I'm working on the video right now
we're kind of show the method in which I
use it for this make sure you guys hit
the links below if you guys have any
questions you guys always connecting on
