gonna do a bTW 2013 review since I
didn't do one last year and everybody I
did do a Twitter commentary but I guess
people really want to know what my
opinions are but before I get started I
do want to start off I want to say this
I a lot of people always ask me why you
don't go to the beach Awards or what
this is that any other or why do I have
such a thing against BT and if it
happened tonight and this is gonna
basically be the reason and the provider
of why I feel the way I feel about BT
you guys know B Scott I'm sure you do
he's a youtuber I love him we've met and
sweetest guy ever you know we're both
androgynous we both don't look like
typical guys you know I'm saying we are
our sexuality well our gender is
questioned daily so he hosted the
pre-show today with Adrienne Bailon from
the Cheetah Girls in throw w well he was
late there and the reason why he was
late because he said it was a complete
wardrobe change at the last minute and
it wasn't his fault and that's because
be basically someone at beach he told
him he came you know be Scott out you
know I'm sure I would do the same thing
he had to the bone straight hair popping
with the middle part he had the
beautiful makeup the fly outfit the the
beautiful hills like he did him and
that's what you're supposed to do
because he was hired to be him only
that's not what they wanted and they
asked him to change who he was in order
to pretty much conform and this is all
what I'm hearing I haven't gotten old
solid source of what the situation is
pretty much this is where the story is
going he said some things on Twitter and
reference to it and I think it's it's
very disrespectful on BET's behalf and
whoever made that car that call should
be reprimanded because you don't hire
anyone to do a job and then actually not
to be who they are when they get to the
job that's just not to be commended or
respected it's stupid so what he was
very hurt by it and especially its 2013
bTW like black and gay thing to not go
very hand-in-hand with one
and you guys seem to still be very
scared but it's here it's not going
anywhere so get the fuck over it it is
2013 we are gay we are happy we are
doing us and you need to get with the
program or get the fuck home because had
that been MTV they would have had no
problem with him in anything he wore but
they're trying to be black friendly
still trying to be gay friendly but yeah
he's still they're trying to knock down
people because other people are gonna
not gonna either understand or be scared
how is somebody gonna eventually
understand what androgyny is what a man
who is as beautiful as we Scott as
beautiful as myself a beautiful as
anybody else out here is it just always
swept under the rug
and mint and basically shoved in their
face to be something that they are not
that is the problem today
so bTW you get a big s plus for that and
you get the plus because you asked him
to be there and be a hose you get the F
because the way you did it but shout out
to be Scott follow him on Twitter at
love B Scott so off that the show wasn't
really that impressed by it but
basically it opened with Chris Brown you
know he did his Michael Jackson
impression that he does also well um and
he did everybody he was asked me about
the song that he did with Ali and hi
Phil about it I love Ali you guys know
I'm one of the biggest Aliyah fans I
just don't think that anybody who
touches anything in reference to her is
ever gonna be good enough in my eyes
maybe you can call me by a she can call
me a bitch you can call me whatever the
fuck you want I get caught I've been
called worse by better but I'm not a big
fan of the song it's cool it's just her
voice is just being way to sample around
these parts you know I'm saying it's
just it's not okay with me
but he did do a good job shout-out to
Chris I don't have anything against
Chris Brown I mean I know more but you
know shout out to Chris Brown and the
things that he done and he he made his
fans happy tonight so that's a good
thing
um so yeah he brought out Nicki Minaj
now this is where the problem came in
okay and Nicki look beautiful tonight
her outfit was cute hair Nicki
finally you must have seen my video girl
cuz you know
that lace front you got rid of everybody
he was tired of being the butt of the
joke I heard you girl um
shout to tatianna Ward who's a youtuber
here who did Nikki's makeup tonight um
but yeah Nikki and it wasn't her fault
it was B cheeseball what you expect
um whoever the bleep er was to bleep out
the cuss words and I'm sure she had
rehearsals
um knew she was gonna cuss and every
time she said a cuss word they believed
after the customer so it was like bitch
bleep nigga bleep ass be wet bleep like
you look too slow you're just like a day
late and a dollar short
so basically Nicki Minaj said nigga ass
wet bitch and I bleep dick on national
TV and I'm sure the FCC is gonna find bt
very big for that because that is a big
no-no um maybe by the time it gets to
the west coast it should be coming on it
should actually be on for the west coast
now it may change and they may you know
go back and fix it but when we seen live
she cussed loud and proud so yeah that
was that but Chris did a great job the
next person that performed
I think after him was Robin Thicke and
I'm not a fan of Robin Thicke I think
he's cool but his music doesn't do
anything for me and his performances
never do anything for me so I was just
kind of over it didn't really care um so
yeah Nicki Minaj I think performed but I
don't I just remember her coming in with
Ciara and being on Chris Brown shit but
I don't remember a performer herself and
maybe just because I just don't care so
it kind of is what it is Ciara did body
party and she did whatever that turn you
on or whatever song is with Nicki
Minaj's she just premiered the video for
now she premiered the video at the
pre-show her ex-boyfriend is background
she looked like Keri Hilson
Angela Simmons is Ballas new girlfriend
and they were interviewing Ciara
it was just like I'm sure they are dull
enough to handle it but it was still
weird like it was just so my ex bitch is
interviewing a new bitch and I'm sitting
right here like it was just it was just
a little off but CR just seemed to be
like my heart where I carry shit like oh
yeah this is my new video you know but
shout out to her Nicki for the video
because they Giuseppe's was so cute and
I wanna well they had the widgets on I
just want the tennis shoes um so yeah
she did that she did a great job and she
me Sierra always does a good job as far
as performing its concern dance wise I
don't judge her vocals because Sierra to
me is equivalent to my girl Britney and
Sierra bitch go with your strengths and
you was right to do what the fuck you
did tonight because you know what you
can and you cannot do is either dance or
sing and you wasn't about to sit up
there and thinking about it for us so
yes you better grind that coochie and
pop that ass like you know you can but
she did a great job and she kind of
pushed down I'm just banned oh it just
seemed like she was kind of out to prove
some tonight but she didn't prove that
she Pro she's a bad bitch so shut out -
Sierra I just wish her wig was a little
more tamed and not so nappy and valium
is like I don't understand like I
understand you want value it good if I'm
buying Indian hair it's not gonna look
like Kunta Kinte in the no I'm not not
to myself so yeah but she did a great
job
Miguel performed now Miguel I'm not
again I'm not a fan of Miguel's like
that I really don't care that much about
Miguel than anything he does I don't
like that adorned song
I'm not he reminds me of like Prince had
a baby with Janelle Monae or some shit
like I don't know he's different people
like I'm cool you know shout-out to him
he's doing his thing he has a Grammy
you know um but I was whatever the thing
that really killed me about his
performance I think the most is that he
looked like he wanted to jump in that
damn audience again and he know better
you don't getting what you want player
that is not
what you want um but he did not but his
jacket which killed me was the simple
fact that it was like somebody took a 10
and a 12 inch of virgin Indian here and
made a jacket out of it and it has sheep
remember Tina Turner's dress in what's
love got to do with it the shingle
rolling on the river dress that's what
the jacket reminded me of but it was
black and I was just like I would shout
out to the virgin Indian hair jackets
you got on right now like I need that
and his background like his backdrop
look like are Kelly's Jackie and next
person we gonna talk about is our Kelly
all right Kelly came out it look like he
called all his homies and they cousins
at the City of Refuge Church here in LA
and say I need laquanda Ashley
Antoinette
mezzanine and Keshia to call all a home
girls that seemed are you these can hold
her to me and I need them to come out
you know with my performance at the BT
words with some Lopes on and sing some
of my greatest hits so it was kind of
like a black Glee situation poppin off
then he comes out looking like mr. black
porcupine it had to be at least 5,000
studs on his jacket and hat alone um and
he did Brady's basically a medley of all
his songs now what killed me was the
fact that when you do something like
that you usually do like a long period
so I guess cause he had such a long
career it just sounded as if we were
listening to like a now 45 hour Kelly
mix and we just kept going to the next
song cuz he was only doing about how
good it was like snippets my mind is
telling me this is the remix to it like
it just that's what it was like it
wasn't really cohesive as far as like
kind of getting into the song so yeah
shout out to him um in here we performed
and I so tuned out cuz I don't like her
so next to change didn't care
Craig Franklin didn't care Tamela Mann
didn't care for real I love me some
Pharrell I
he is he looks like the Stuart Little
and he's just so cute to me but he came
out I don't think he performed by
yourself I think he performed with
Justin Timberlake in here perform I mean
with Charlie Wilson and he came out for
something else I don't remember who
cares they just look really cute though
a pinching tomorrow came out with this
hood as backdrop that looked like one of
the many project homes in LA he's from
Compton so I you know I would expect it
but it looks like a typical hood
background or whatever very reminiscent
of a Snoop Dogg's doggy style cover and
he did his song poetic justice and he
did whatever other song he got I don't
know I don't I don't keep up with him
like that but he did his songs and the
Erykah Badu came out killing the gang I
love Erica nappy hearing oh that's my
bitch cuz fucking oh her first album
still gets me motherfucking right so
shout out to Erykah Badu I love you boo
you did that shit um but they did it
they did a really good job I just didn't
like the way the Erica walked off with
that thank a dank ass walk that she gave
you just like bitch I got no panties now
that's how she walked on that it wasn't
cute um Snoop Dogg came out and did
beautiful with Charlie Wilson during his
obviously his inauguration
during his tribute with Justin
Timberlake and it was cute you know he
did his little two-step at he as he
always does and he look you know he
looked decent he still look old as hell
in the face but you know he is getting
old
see I performed I didn't really remember
now Mariah Carey I love you MC and my
ex-boyfriend is like one of the biggest
Mariah Carey fans that you will ever
meet however mariah is not like Sierra
nor Britney
so more I can actually sing I don't know
what's going on her lately but she's
been doing a lot of lip-syncing and it's
a lot of obvious lip-syncing like if you
gonna lip-sync then you bitch you need
to get it right like you need to master
it
like you need to take some tips from
Britney and JLo they can get you right
but if the mic is here mariah is she
doesn't know her huge eating
to do a lot of this because it's
supposed to be a lot of you know a lot
of this when she doesn't know the word
so if you ever see her perform live or
watch it again when she keeps missing
her cues she's not like Beyonce you know
I'm saying where she can hit a cue as
soon as she hear it she's not there and
she didn't do nothing but roll around in
a chandelier stand there you know she
does she did Mariah she just and then
she rolled back around that was it you
know but it's to be expected
it is Mariah Carey would do that's what
she does you ain't never said Mariah
Carey kills the choreography you ain't
never seen no shit like that so she did
a song with McGill she did the remix my
boyfriend said that that the song she
did was the remix to purse on her
current song beautiful with my girl that
was with Young Jeezy and he just came
out I think yesterday or the day before
yesterday or whatever but she did it um
but you're Mariah you just get the
lip-synching down though cuz you're
killing me she looked great though the
thing that really killed me is the fact
that Nick Cannon's ass came out with him
cocaine right glasses gone looking like
somebody pimp stomping talking about
some shout-out to my wife and in five
octaves I'm gonna hit that tonight like
yeah like I know they got two kids and
shit but nobody wants to hear about and
Nick Cannon beating anything up unless
it's a punching bag right just gross but
shout out to them okay you shout out to
them Nicki Minaj r14 she wanted an award
for best hip-hop artist now the issue
that I have obesity in this category in
general is that they always sent the
category up to give her the award she
never is nominated against nobody of her
caliber only because it is simple fact
there I mean I get what you're saying
there is no one out there of her caliber
I guess you could say that's like
winning and female rap that's cool but
to put her on a cat just give her the
award make it a pre-shot ward and just
give it to her but to put you up put her
up against a Rashidah Rashidah as if and
she talks as if Mary me was like the
biggest top 10 chart
girls shudder I will handle her in my
living hip-hop review but that's coming
too but yeah it was just like you knew
Nikki was gonna win she's won four years
in a row and it's to be expected and
she's liking you know Nikki gets up
there acting like she loves to do only
going guys borrow you want and then
she'll say something real stupid and ask
me bleep doctor she cuz that's just I
mean Nikki is just kind of a one-trick
pony at this point but shout out sorry
she look beautiful
um she was promoting her little beer or
Moscato line which is a little tacky cuz
you're drinking at the bt I don't know
fuck who's paying you to do what you
still look real tacky but you ain't got
no class if you drinking out of a little
bottle on the public show like you know
I'm sayin
but whatever um it was a lot of kids
asking for Dwayne Wade tonight too like
I know y'all like basketball is she you
know these athletes in I mean these
rappers and stuff play you would swear
his name was Jesus and him and Gabrielle
had an immaculate conception with a baby
called Spalding you know he's just like
really is it that serious you know but
it was cute he got a award for some shit
that I didn't care about um and then
Gabby Douglas she actually was honored
for the things that she have done she's
done too so I think that was good um
she's she's she's a sweet young lady
which I really like she cares herself
very well to be so very young um and
then my boo performed ASAP rocky which I
was so happy about because he I just you
guys know I if you don't know you don't
know today I love mr. ASAP rocky he's
just you are everything to me so I love
him and he got a VT Award for the song
with Kendrick Lamar and I'm so happy for
him because I think they both deserve
the things that they've gotten tonight
cuz they've worked very hard for you
know both of them have worked very hard
so it's actually very good to see
someone so young both of them get so
much recognition
and let's see it wasn't really many
awards that when Chris Brown got a war
for something I didn't care about and
then I think that was pretty much it as
far as you know that was concerned and
then he had Lala in the back doing the
tweets you know and she just always loud
in her eyes always bugged like we
latched your face girl like and just in
and aloud but other than that though you
know she does she does what she does
Kat Graham I don't really know much
about her I just know her she's on some
CW show but her lace wig looked like
some shit tire bags throughout like the
second season of the Tyra show and
didn't want no more cause it was so ashy
and so bad but okay I'm not you're like
what the fuck is Kat Graham exactly but
it's I'm running against her because she
actually has the Jeffrey Campbell shoes
I have that's where I see him on first
but whatever um Stevie Wonder came out
there with him three dreads back here
like I love Stevie Wonder but someone
really needs to take his ass and sit him
down and let him take a Clippers to his
just mmmm like it's over it is over
why is your shit back here and he just
ending he couldn't find him like I mean
I know he's lying job but somebody could
have directed him like Stevie it is like
10 paces to the right heel I was like
it's just it's just too like it's
disrespectful like y'all gotta stop
doing Stevie like that but other than
that though I'm not really too pleased
with the show especially their kind of
the way that things were handled or
whatever the pre-show was a hot-ass mess
literally but it's to be expected this
bTW I just want to see what MTV's gonna
do this year if I've missed anybody
don't know what to tell you cuz it
really didn't stick out in my mind
that's all but this year I'll give them
like I said f+ because they really
fucked up with gay marriage being legal
and whatnot now and us having all of
these rights and stuff to do somebody of
the LGBT community like
and you wanted them in there because you
basically needed that platform and then
you fucked it up
it doesn't really sit well with me but
let me know what y'all thought if I miss
anything
is just honestly because I just didn't
care
like the whole show to me was just kind
of a waste it was better than it has
been it still isn't the best bTW just
struggles to give us a quality show in
my opinion that's worth talking about
for a long period of time this is not
like kind of old-school Soul Train used
to be and all of this stuff you know
there are the presentation is better but
it's B G you know you kind of take the
good with the bad in this situation it
was more bad than it was good but it was
cool it's just like the whole Illuminati
just didn't show up
Rihanna jay-z Beyonce Kanye West Meek
Mill Drake Rick Ross they they were
having a meeting or something and I
think Nicki just came to represent to
show dinner that you know the Illuminati
was very present I guess I don't know or
maybe she wasn't invited I don't know
well yeah it was just a lot of them were
missing so I get to show didn't feel
full because a lot of the known people
besides the ones that I named were just
not there
so an Ashanti was Ashanti Michelle
Williams and Maya was there who the fuck
invited any of them they do who let them
in somebody was being nice you can let
them image any tomorrow they almost
didn't get in tomorrow and almost didn't
get in because the security was a mess
like it was just a mess like too much
but you know it is what it is so I hope
you guys enjoy this if you guys may have
any questions or anything or have
thought about something let me know just
write it at the bottom and I will talk
to y'all later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
