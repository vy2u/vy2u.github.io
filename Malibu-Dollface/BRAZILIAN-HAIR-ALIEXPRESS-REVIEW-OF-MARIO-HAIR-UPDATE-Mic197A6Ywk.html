update video for my Mario's hair from
Aliexpress I know a lot of you guys were
asking me how did the hair hold up and
how was he doing and this is it this is
it's still popping though I worth his
hair to a party it was like a house
party not not that's at my house party
but it was like you know like a it was a
event gathering pretty much and it was
hot or whatever but the hair still held
up ivko washed his hair three times I've
washed his hair with a sulfate shampoo
three times um and this a still came
back like the natural wave of the hair
it actually still came back now what I
will say is it's not as curly or as wavy
as it was when I initially got it it has
a little it's a little different but I
do like it like it's not it's more a
wavy um it's more wavy than it was it
seemed like it was curly before um and
then I also shared some two-leg I was
getting a nice amount of strands as I
was running my fingers through it but
other than that it's still full and
again this is three bundles that I have
in so for this to be three bundles it
still looks pretty full and natural like
it has his natural beachy waves
hence my Ninja Turtle shirt um this is
beachy wave to it um which I like that's
why I kind of opted for like more of a
natural makeup
well it ain't dead damn natural but it's
natural roll risk so um yeah again this
harris from Mario's hey check out my
initial review for this hair somebody
also actually hot as his hair do you
think it would take color very well or
have you colored it no I have a tendency
to not color my hair when I get it I
usually buy it in which color I want to
color it like for instance if it's gonna
be great then I'll do the hair
I'll get it you know in a nice 6:13 so
that it's this pale blonde color and
it'll take the color because a lot of
times when you color hair especially
when you're lifting the hair and you're
using some sort of bleach it doesn't
always keep the original pattern in
which it came so that kind of is the
thing that I don't like about coloring
hair is
if I do it I can do it very well and it
will look very nice the only thing that
I'm not a big fan of is the fact that it
starts to look not the same like the
curls are not is uniform if I can find
some curly hair that's like my other
hair or even like this but it's like
blonde oh I'll take it because I don't
want to disturb the integrity of the
curls but yeah it's still it's still
holding up the closure is still holding
up it didn't like shed really like
ridiculously I kind of thought it was
but it didn't shed like crazy um and it
didn't matter up or get anything it was
very soft though you know with the water
because sometimes when you put a hair
and water it's completely different than
what it is when you initially get it so
I do like this hair I just wish that
there were more bundles to the hair and
I wish that um I don't remember what I
said in my initial review I don't know
if I said this or not but I do wish that
the hair was a little longer that's the
only thing that but yeah for some
inexpensive hair again I think it was
like two two dollars two hundred and
some change for three bundles plus a
closure if a lace closure but again I'm
gonna try they're longer straighter hair
just to see on what the quality of that
hair is for you guys to like longer hair
like me like the 30 inch hair
I want to see how much like how that
looks and i'ma try it with like three
bundles and see how that I'm so scared
cuz you know it's really one hair is
long but we'll see how that works out
but I'll be back definitely um I'm happy
that a lot of you guys have ordered your
hair and they asked you guys actually
really liked it so that's the great
thing so I'll catch you guys in my next
one I will talk to y'all later bye bye
and also remember to follow
Mario's hair on Instagram and I'll put
their information here and it should
have been out this entire video and make
sure you follow me as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
