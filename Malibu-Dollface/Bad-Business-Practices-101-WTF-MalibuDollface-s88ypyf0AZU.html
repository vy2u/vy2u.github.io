story time this is just really just how
I feel right now okay
this is about people with bad ass
business practices and bad as people
working for them so here we are I found
this really dumb dentist on Instagram
and you know I love to keep my smile
white take a bleaching I also want to
get some of my veneers redid so I was
like okay well he looks like you know
he's his clients are is night and day so
I'm like okay so I hit him up and this
was like back in March for some reason
when I hit him up on heat while I hit
him up on Instagram and then he sent me
his I like just email and then they'll
send you information in order to help
consultation that we can go from there
okay cool so I end up hitting him up and
then this was back in March mind you I
got a response but for whatever reason
the response kind of it didn't go to my
spam but it just didn't pop up like it
should have and I mind you I have about
six different emails so I go to all
mailboxes to look so I didn't see it
until probably about two weeks ago
probably and I was like oh my god I'm so
sorry I thought I just never got a reply
but I see that you did reply so the lady
who answers to female was my okay no
problem when would you like to come in I
said as soon as possible let me know
because I kind of want to get some work
done before the end of the year now I
went to a plastic surgeon's office
recently about something and no it's not
about changing my gender because
I know somebody don't think that it's
not about that it's about something else
or anything about me being a woman is
nothing related to that so I was trying
to kind of coincide things I hit her and
I was like okay well you know let me
know what works best for you so she told
me this light this past Monday that uh
this would be the appointment okay now
mind you guys I'm currently in the midst
of getting one of my tattoos removed
which was the Barbie tattoo that I had
right here as you can see it's very
faded and I've been going to dr. Tara
to get my um to get this removed and
I've been doing this since um I believe
since December of last year i'ma tell
y'all sino the works
sidenote the hurts so if you got
something that's gonna take
I had six treatments my sister went with
me and they told her she was gonna need
ten so just be prepared for the pain
people but I said all that to say when I
do go and I do have new appointments
because they spread them out over about
an eight week period I always get calls
to say are you gonna come in because if
I don't come in and I say I am they call
to confirm just to make sure that
nothing has happened because they don't
want to have a technician here that
could not be there they're paying
somebody so they charge you $35 so back
to my point so this lady never asked for
my phone number she just kind of said
this is the email that she gave me cool
so when she replied back
she said yeah we could do Monday do you
have our dress I said no can you please
give it to me
I never see and I kept checking that
night I never seen this is Sunday night
I'm watching power and I didn't get an
email at least I didn't see the email
and mind you I have six I see everything
that I get because I was doing business
I was emailing friends I was emailing
one of my grandmother's so I should have
seen the email well I did not so I was
like well maybe it was cancelled maybe I
don't know I still don't know how to get
there because I don't think his office
was listed on his Instagram and I didn't
even go look because I'm still waiting
for old chick to hit me back well later
on that day I was um checking for
something else I was looking for
something hair related and I ran into
the email and it was there so I emailed
her back and matted by this time it was
like seven o'clock or was it Tuesday
it was either to Monday at 7:00 or
Tuesday at 7:00 I don't remember so I
was like oh my god I did not see this
like i legit didn't see this I wish I
would have gotten at least a call like
somebody could have called me or
something just to confirm that this
would have been the situation because
this is kind of how
a car works well she decides to hit me
back with well you should have called
and canceled if you wasn't going to come
you wasted the doctor's time that was an
hour that he cannot give back and this
this this and this and all I heard was
bitch bitch and more bitch and I it took
every ounce of my soul not to call her
every four-letter word that I have ever
learned in the human language
because i'ma tell you something
mistakes are made this is why people
actually what is when you go places now
especially what is your email what is
your phone what is your Mellon address
we're gonna make sure to be you in touch
with you because that's business okay
now she was like well she continued to
say well the doctor is booked for a
couple of months at this point but it's
kind of funny done when I hit him up he
was just so open so but I'll see what I
can do okay so my reply was oh no you
good you're fine thank you very much for
your services and we're gonna call it a
day now I'm not by any means saying that
it was not my fault because I legit
didn't see it I can't reply to something
or cancel something that I didn't see
but you should have had a better come
back because this is not your business
there's a reason why you're answering
emails and phones okay and trust me I'm
not throwing any shade that does not
need to be thrown because I used to be a
receptionist at faux different places so
I know exactly how this goes that's why
I'm speaking my truth about such
situation back to my point but a lot of
times mistakes happen and it's how you
come back from them especially when
there's money involved because he don't
know what I was coming for there was
never a discussion about what I wanted
done they were supposed to be just a
council a consultation I could have been
up in there and be like I want my
everything snatched out my mouth I want
to pay cash and I got no insurance was
good
all that money now is lost because her
mouth told me one something that I did
need to know hen's day being ruined in
that hour being a waste of time had
thing to do with tea in China and her
stupid ass should have sat down and said
well how can we rectify this situation
is there a phone number that I can call
you you know I'm saying what are the
hours that are great for you these are
the things that should have been said
because now this man is missing out of
money a penalty his books so he ain't
really missing out on too much but when
all is said and done a lot of times I
see this V the situation I recently had
this happen with a company I ordered
from and it was it's more of a hmm
I'm gonna play it's more an independent
company so that means that there's not a
corporation of people that are doing
this this is these are people like you
and Mom
you know you and myself we are calling
taking orders sending things out so
there was a situation where I ordered a
particular product that I've ordered
from this company before mind you and
it's mine it's been months and I still
not have not received this particular
item and it was for something that I
used to shoot with so emailed them and
was like hey um don't know what's going
on my order has been about two weeks in
everything else that I've ever ordered
from you you sent it out like that so I
don't let me know what's going on you
know if they're back ordered you've got
to get more totally understand no reply
so then I waited about another week cuz
again I'm just not sitting around
waiting for somebody to reply
necessarily because I got I gots to
do do so I'm still sitting here like
okay I spent a lot of weekend no reply
so then I see that I get an email from
um them which is the link to their site
for me to check a message no mind you I
checked out with PayPal so therefore all
the information would have been on my
PayPal account because I don't have an
account with the site they give you the
option to check out so there should be
an alternative you know resolved for any
messages that you know so again I'm like
um well I got your message but I can't
check it I don't know what it is and I
felt like at that particular point they
should have just sent me whatever was in
that link to my email so we could have
just resolved it no reply Tom just
sitting there like Oh
so I'm peg how they give you so much
time in between two Oh
phallic lame so I think I've made this
purchase back in I want to say June or
July possibly and I have up until the
28th of January of 2017 to dispute it so
I started a dispute which I hate to do
because it just you know I feel like
anything can be worked out again this is
what you learn when you're working in
human relations you learn to resolve
something but because there is no
resolve and I mind you after the little
link with it I sent several other emails
and they were not returned so I'm like
whoa
I just spent 200 close to 300 dollars on
one item that I have not gotten yet so
yeah I want my money back so I
email I started the claim next day um
well we apparently they never sent it
first and foremost and it was one of the
lights that I used to record with I
needed it for another project that I am
doing I wanted to have done and out by
now but clearly um so it was a
particularly that I wanted and I have
order from this company I told you for a
lot of my other stuff that I have so
I've never understood you know I've
never had issues with them up until now
so I'm like well I emailed you I cannot
check it are we supposed to use your
paypal email to log in I'm like but
there's they're asking for a password
there is no password I don't understand
how I'm posed to login and ask me for
something that I've never made so
they're like oh well you do this you do
this and you do this and you do that so
I was like well I'm no longer interested
in in the product anymore I was just
like a refund so the response kind of
was oh what a refund will be between
these days and you know this time and
this time for you to get it back and I'm
just like I'm not gonna even argue with
them I'm not hard up for the money I
just want it back because I didn't get
what I had originally ordered so when
stuff like this happens and you guys are
running businesses and rather it's
myself anybody make sure
your customer as if it was you because
when all is said and done you're missing
out on money because you want to be
prideful and have an attitude I called
the Department of Water and
Power the other day about something and
I'm telling the bitch within the email
and the bitches getting attitude
with me as an unfuckin line she said
well the email said all that I said
would you like me to order it to you if
you feel as if some I'm lining up some
kind of a lot about email for like our
serious well I just feel I said I don't
listen man I don't know you you if I had
to pick my representatives bitch it
wouldn't be you cuz you already
up like you act like I told you grew you
should go work for the Department of
Water and Power and the customer
relations department that'll be a great
job for you Beatrice I didn't say that I
just simply called somebody and they've
connected me to you bitch and I'm
telling you where I got so can you help
what I got to do to make this go away
what do I got to do to get the off
the phone with Joe hands because I feel
like a lot of times people don't look at
it like that you're making this
situation way more than it needs to be
for the both of us
and I'm not trying to sit here and be a
problem but I'm also not gonna sit here
let you talk to me like I'm
stupid because he then that's where the
problem comes there's a reason why you
can call corporate there's a
reason okay because the bitch who think
that she been here and this has been her
career for the last 25 years and she
ain't got much to offer life but her
 wack ass attitude you can show
that vision better than you can
tell her so people in closing make sure
when you're doing business of
any sorts that you're respectful to your
customer because it's gonna be one day
where somebody's gonna write a bad
review they're going to say the wrong
thing they're gonna hurt your
feelings and then you may be the cause
of somebody else a business okay
so remember is listen I always tell
people I don't want to work at
McDonald's okay but somebody got to give
me my chicken nuggets so when I
ask for extra sauce and I'm willing to
pay for the extra sauce don't
 look at me like I just said can
I
have a platter of with a side of P
okay you you garden the song sis with
all your good eye I told you I get your
 money how much you want for the
sauce huh 25 cents in a dollar fifty I
don't give a
just give me my sauce to go with my
 nuggets so I can go and finish
my day and you can finish just
working at this goddamn window that you
seem to hate so much what you apply for
stop applying for that you're not
ready for stop applying for and you
want to have attitudes I know to me
 who have jobs then they
got act like eat doing
this these my man you gonna get
 cuz I get my in
your bar complaining to me but it's
all how you come out of you know saying
so again get your business right keep
your business right be respectful to
your customers and make sure
that you do what you say you're gonna do
if you say you're gonna ship the ship
between 10 and 14 days make sure is
between 10 and 14 days because
if I'm waiting twenty five days
I got a problem okay I don't even want
the no more I want my money
back and I want interest bitch okay so
I'm gonna go the review for this Harris
up and if the name is going up and I'll
catch y'all in my next one
bitch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
