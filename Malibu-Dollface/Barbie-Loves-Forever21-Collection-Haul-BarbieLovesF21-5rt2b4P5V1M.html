been I think this collection came out
last week where this Kudo cuz I got
Shawn back okay so you guys know that I
did a video and I uploaded it about the
Barbie collection and a lot of people
were asking me um since you know you
went to purpose 21 I got the stuff that
they came knocking into a hall about it
so I'm sorry to just haul it up a little
bit longer than I had anticipated but
it's fine
okay it's cool cuz stuff is still
available so you'll be cool so Barbie
Barbie's 55th anniversary was this year
and usually when things happen for
Barbie Mattel our Barbie Collector do
the same thing they do something big for
our birthday but they didn't do anything
this year like it was very quiet II came
in and went and that was kind of it I
was just like I mean I got the the 50th
anniversary Sports Illustrated Barbie
that's the one that I got that was in
Sports Illustrated magazine um but other
than that there was really nothing so
then I hear through the grapevine from
one of my sources that there there had a
stamp collection coming out and I heard
about this like back in February so I
thought it was done coming out during
her birthday and it's so didn't so I was
just like okay well they announced it or
whatever so when I was at forever 21 I
seen a flyer and I'm you know I know
that Barbie logo anywhere so I was just
like what is this for she likes any
event we're having here and it's gonna
be like a pink carpet and all of his
other stuff but you should come and I
was like you have no idea that you just
made my damn day so I had ended up going
and when I got there they had like the
pink Corvette outside in follow me on
instagram using the picture they have a
pink Corvette outside with a little
small like the actual like toy on top of
it and kids from play where they like it
Joe um and then I had this guy who has
the all-american
get it kin shirt on which you can get um
Barbie Collector and they had our pink
carpet with Barbies name all of you know
the back that you can take pictures with
actual guy that was the Ken doll I
didn't do that cuz I got a man and I
don't know this for him tsk um so I
didn't take any pictures or whatever but
the girl came he from the bad girls club
I think the car blondie I don't remember
but she was there with some other chick
and they look real high and old and they
had a dog they're just like so it was
just it looked a mess so anyway um they
have if you ever been to Santa Monica
promenade here in California then you
know for a fact there's like if there's
a permissioning one but it's sliced in
half so one sided shoes and accessories
and the other side is um just closed and
then upstairs so they had just the side
where the shoes and accessories were up
until the escalator all that was the
Barbie stuff so they had the mannequins
in a DJ it was very cramped was what I
didn't like it was very crammed but they
had all everything that was on display
so they didn't have any bags so I ended
up getting cuz I wanted to back in
general and I've seen this on the side I
was like this is so cute because here in
California on what they doing is
everywhere else but you like go to
Target and stuff they don't give you
bags anymore you have to pay extra for a
brown paper bag and sometimes you don't
want to pay extra or sometimes you just
forget those bags at home so imma start
keeping this bag in my car or whatever
so this is um a barb this is Barbie and
I think she's in a Ferrari or a Porsche
I don't recognize this car and I can't
really see the logo but I think it's a
Porsche so yeah this was really cute and
this bag was it was 390 and all of the
tags with the Barbie collection came
double-sided was her name on one side
and it was her face with the twenty one
number on them so I got this bag the
next thing that I got was this makeup
case I have one from Betsey Johnson
that's really cute but it's really full
so I didn't I needed another one or
whatever so this one was cute so it says
fabulous it has all the hashtags on it
and this was 690 I looked on the site
this is not on the site so I don't know
if they sold out or what
yeah this is really cute it feels really
good I don't know what type of material
this will be considered but it feels
really really good so it has all the
hashtags on here like fabulous plastic
molded arm anything that you can think
of Barbie related pretty much is on here
one of the words that is on here tell me
if you can you can peep the word that
I'm talking about right now
it's right there your face and I know
what they mean it to be but it's kind of
a double entendre because it says the
word which would be Barbie but you know
we know to be word to be yeowch so yeah
this is really cute it's really big and
this was one of the displays that I took
because I didn't want the one of the
flat one so it still has stuff in it so
I'll be using this I'm probably going to
end up witness in my heart for
additional makeup so when I need to go
somewhere I have taken all my whole
entire thing with me all this damn
makeup and I'm saying I can just put it
in here okay so the next thing that I
brought was this now my you guys gonna
be like what the hell this is for you'll
see soon enough because I'm about to
start
um Malibu Malibu doll face calm so I
needed something because I had a photo
shoot that I had to do which I already
did and that's what my hair so long but
it was this and it's a Barbie bodysuit
and I have another one these that's
black from them and I wasn't going to
get it because I'm like I don't really
have a use for but then I thought about
it like hmm and then this is actually
what it was 1080 so that's why I brought
it because of how cheap it actually was
nothing in his collection went over I
think $34 or whatever I was like okay
I'll go ahead and knock out there ten
dollars I got that so then the next
thing that I brought was this sweater
was I sweater it's like a split sure is
too sure long sleeve shirt I guess but
it has this beautiful Barbie on the
front
I really wish she was black you know cuz
they're all of all Barbies but I really
wish there was a lot
or even Asian you know just not just
just brick for Barbie but it wouldn't be
Barbie or she would that wouldn't be her
name running would be Christy or
surveying or something like that so it
has this Barbie on the front which
actually on this ball this is the Barbie
basic stall and then it's the back has
the exact same creature on it so this is
cute
I tried it on and it's actually as you
can see this was 1980 it actually has a
it's actually a small but yeah the
colors a little bit big but if I wear
this with some really cute tight jeans
and kind of give that loose top tight
bottom look then it'll be really cute um
the next thing I got I didn't buy that
much stuff even though it was a lot of
stuff in me was a lot of stuff but it
was a decent amount of stuff in the
collection I didn't buy everything that
I saw because everything that I saw
wasn't it I didn't wasn't gonna use it
like it was just cute backpack that had
her face and like a lot of other Barbie
basics on it but I know I'm gonna use
the backpack for no damn reason so it
was a waste of me just in was $24 so I'm
like I'm away $24 when I could just like
go up dinner so yeah um the last thing
that I got was this shirt that said it's
a crop top and it says Barbie and a
reflection says perfect and this shirt
was 1519 so when I walked in the lady
everybody was like so excited about my
damn 20 alamo jacket so they were giving
out like all these little decals and
stuff like that so really so um they
gave me these nail decals or whatever
and they give you instructions on the
back and then it gave me two of these
little fake iPhones that has a
conversation with Barbie and Ken
on it this is the same dog that's on the
sweatshirt so and then in the back it
just says this one's a look like iPhone
so you guys want to like hear all has a
little button to where you can on a
little Barbie home button I didn't
notice that it is this is a conversation
we can and it says hi can hard Barbie
check out my cute collection at forever

fabulous pick me up at the dream house
xoxo so this was really cute so and then
the last thing that I got was this I
wore this in my last video in my review
video for this hair and a lot of people
like P please tell me we got this jacket
from this jacket is from the world
collection it's a mesh jacket as you can
see I left the tag on it for reason I
don't think I've been walking around cuz
I have not been working around with tag
on it because you can see through it um
but it was 1794 this jacket and in the
back it says for every so if I wear a
white shirt you'll be able to see this
and it has like a sway feeling type of
material on it and then I'm a friend
now if you button it or whatever it says
doll across the farm which i think is
really really cute so this was my
favorite thing out of the entire um
collection now they would've did like
some shirts like this you would've
believed I would have had it you know
and Lobby would a lot of y'all asking me
instances of Barbie video this tattoo
that I have here says superstar this is
probably the superstar Barbie so a lot
of people were asking like what did you
tattoo say cuz it's really pretty but I
can't tell let's say yeah it says
superstar because I love desert star
party so yeah that's everything that I
got in this collection I love everything
