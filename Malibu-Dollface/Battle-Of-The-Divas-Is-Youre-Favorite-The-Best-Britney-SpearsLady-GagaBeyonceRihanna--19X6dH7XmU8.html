profanity as well as a lot of strong
opinions from three different
individuals about the current state of
music with female artists if somehow
someway you are easily offended hearing
your favorite diva be slammed by
someone's personal opinion then this
hair video is not for you
I like the matrix but so what's up this
video cuz we on a rush got the dark
because you can't find a key to save
your life they're branding into the life
we love brandy we love you where's your
album girl it's been a while a year but
no I
don't say like that far away though
human was naughty girl I was utterly
unlike true something new
Oh like turn-on distance is something is
missing right here okay so let's get to
the subject at hand okay cuz we're
trying to catch this Tannen it's
motherfucking darker um we gonna talk
about I guess you could say we call this
the Battle of the deepest cuz it seemed
like lately you know the stand war is
I've been there what are you in my life
I mean you can see it on the camera
everybody you know everybody talk about
holiday diva is better and then other
people's divas or whatever right you
know equally we are guess you could say
equally respect out of our child but us
in a car
equally respect different divas little
soul but lately really in music the
women have been the ones putting out
music but a lot of men are not really
putting on music right now so we don't
go to a few people and I you know we all
got opinions on 30 people and I wouldn't
start off with you know and you know
they call it a King me you know she she
slays everybody so y'all say that Beach
is like the epitome of a performance
she's the female MJ oh and uh we talk
about Beyonce Nelson I did a video I
like the two years ago say they're
Beyonce was over radiation and I still
stick by what I said even though she did
give us a break true indeed but what I'm
about to say right now is the honest to
god truth I was a big Destiny's Child
pain in in Destiny's Child
I loved Beyonce included I love Kelly
Villa Tommy was my favorite I was the
original
because you like that boy it rocks nice
all right heartless we here is better
than Kelly in VLC there might be well I
mean they tried to make Kelly look ugly
but we're not gonna win today anyway
okay so then um they got new members
then Michelle came in and I was like
okay so so um whatever whatever
so yes it was so low and I supported her
with a justly in love which I think we
all did because that was actually a
really good out of it was a really good
RB album when I lost Beyonce was during
bday because that was the gay album and
y'all kid
y'all can't lie the ghetto album the
ghetto gay album and I would say that I
am Sasha Fierce was the ghetto gay I
mean they just say gay album 2.0 you
know that's what she gained a lot of
extra gay fans you know cuz every gay
dude I know of cuz I don't know many um
loved single ladies and it was in a
fuckin drawers on YouTube get it down
shout out to you so you know everybody
would say Oh Beyonce is is if any of
this and she said she's a cool performer
I don't think she is the epitome or the
female I think if we go name anybody the
female MJ you would be Jenny
if anybody it's not Beyonce I just wanna
let you guys know and I think the reason
why you guys say that just not just
Beyonce but this goes for like Nicki
Minaj too is because at that point in
time that particular artist is popular
and you guys know when artists have a
fan base when like let's take Rihanna
when Rihanna first came out upon the
replay was bigger than her name nobody
knew her name but they knew that song
that album flopped what if I couldn't go
but it wasn't great one second of them
came out and so else was still bigger
than her name they didn't know who
Rihanna was so then again she still had
that core base that was still buying her
albums that were diehard fans those
people stuck work when good girl gone
back came out an umbrella came out then
she her families grew into the people
who were like oh she's popular now I
like her music so that's when the fan
base starts to get larger and then when
a swank age gets larger then people
start to jump on the bandwagon and say
all yeah Rihanna's this Rihanna's that
Rihanna that but then you have the
hardcore fans have been there since
music of the selarón which most people
don't even know no songs on that out but
pon de replay
yeah I brought that out it was very
Caribbean but I brought that album um
but with Beyonce I don't want to take
nothing from her eyes the artist cuz I
think she's good but people what ho
bitch in the last so I sewed and did it
like her and who did it you know but
which I got to understand is Beyonce was
in a group okay she was a Destiny's
Child and don't act like she performing
like she doing now in Destiny's Child
because as a fan her ass used to walk
from that side of the stage to that side
of the stage she would get in the middle
they would yeah AJ AJ and the song would
be over so don't act like she was just
killing it and performing in all of
these years don't act like that
cuz that she shot will quite some boring
ass performers from right that is
stepping up to survivor survivor they
started to really dance and perform
otherwise Beyonce with wine through the
whole walk go YouTube and watch the Soul
Train Awards they are all that weight on
that be through the whole performance
and they did not dance they were one to
stepping
so no act here and say that because some
Beyonce stands are deafening shell
stands are gonna say and jumping they
did dance jumping jumping yes they did
dance they were jumping this they were
dancing high that's a one-two step
that's what you do it the club you know
that's not single ladies was
choreography that was dancing there is a
difference you know it's a whole catalog
of distance job yeah going down destiny
No can you pay my bill that's pointing
that is not dancing I think it's because
they would have looked out of sync will
the top of your being so short and if
they matter they could have put Lata
Bueller further or something I think
they would look weird it doesn't matter
it really cuz Adrian was short in 3rw
she was the shortest and she still kept
up so that's not an excuse and the top
you wet net damn short
Mary look like little Kim sighs right I
mean everybody wore heels but anyway now
they're saying that Beyonce's album is
gonna be sold for 49 cents because they
got leaked okay so I'm gonna start
calling her miss 4019 because if this is
the nature this is rumored but this is
true yeah I'll miss being stalking for
you guys since then and then y'all know
that Alma's not good now I know let me
tell you I was excited I will not lie
about this album until I heard the
singles now the girls who run the world
should have been a Vanessa Hudgens song
that should not have been no fuckin
Beyonc you are - you're 29 years old
you're not a girl why she go over just
30 - fuckin 30 she like 31 third okay
fucking cuz I'm gonna go after you go
ahead so basically the song I mean we
had independent women how she goes from
calling y'all women to girls that don't
make no sense to me I understand their
peril I'm powering but in every
interview she said she didn't even
believe their girls were in the world so
you lied I understand the song suck
dinner second single 1+1 stuck say what
you want to say - it was just this world
towards that I cried it was so amazing I
said bitch you wanna be part of her team
so you know I wouldn't agree so this is
a ballerina so then I'm her next thing
was the best I never had sucked so down
leaked and of course I was scented and I
listened to it and it sucked it's not
like she's in 4 different genres we're
not John was but she's like she's in
four different decades I guess you could
say with that album is like it's
the place that has no structure and it's
very bad and heavy and I will give her
credit where credit is due I like the
song I rather die young that's the only
song in that entire album that I feel is
acceptable otherwise she should she
should do another album because it sucks
and everybody knows that it sucks and
that's why if true allegedly it's gonna
be $0.49
because they her team knows that it's
not gonna sell like baby like they're
not gonna get the numbers that they need
she on our CEO status well you know I
don't like me on say I've never liked
her like I think she's a terrible dancer
like I understand she has rhythm but you
know how she dances like the shit with
our ass like even like yesterday were
watching the booty this video yeah we
said can't see me yesterday watching a
movie licious video you can see the
difference no ass she got here
Beyonce is 37 years she was Beyonce is
not 29 that bitch in Ohio on yes she
been 29 for the last like four years go
look at some shit from 2008 oh say
Beyonce 29 like what the fuck come on
like I don't know her age I don't know I
don't well legislation she's 29 they've
been shitty 29 I don't I'm just I'm not
I respect her and I said she has talent
but her and like even at Leisha Keys
they're just people that I just can't
get into their music Alicia Keys boards
me she's her music it's good to put you
right now Destiny's Child like I like a
few destination shops on but I like
Kelly Rowland too but yeah try not to
Kelly a really hard thing right now and
is this long overdue cuz I have our
albums I brought purchase and I love
them so I'm happy that people are
actually seeing that she's talented and
she's not a lot our backup singer like
man jail
so yeah I don't I mean like we're saying
we're not staying at Beyonce's that bad
artist we're just saying that she gets
too much credit for what she has to do
like she's not the epitome of all new
God and she's not no because of the
anytime sake don't know they call her be
Jesus there's so many gasps oh ok so
basically she's a good artist she has
the music when she wants to
I feel like now she's really awesome
others she heard music R&amp;amp;B she needs to
end another shit and not the army not
the 70s and spot I think Solange has
something to do with this recent album
because it's very afro centric I think
that because remember everybody was
comparing their albums of Sam Salons
album was way better than I am so stay
probably she probably was like okay well
let me go ahead and listen to what my
sister didn't try to do this but it's
like I still I don't want to listen to
the album I don't give a shit on a she
wrote their show anymore so she couldn't
do it so okay awkward let's go to Gaga
okay now
Gaga as you guys know me and Willy were
very Pro Gaga in 2009 was she before
paparazzi at the MTV Awards and she did
a great job and her first I love even
the rereleased I love but bitch with you
right now I mean I was so I mean I like
I know cuz she was different when she
first came in with a poker face she was
different she was still a blonde she was
still you know kind of whatever still
into
she was still into I mean everybody is
doing what she's done it's from
everybody know her music y'all know some
shit we don't put it at the bottom but
uh you know Gaga now it seems like and
when she first came out it seems like
she was an artist who really took pride
in her music it happened to be a little
bit different to stand out from Britney
and Christina I think that's what she
was doing or where she was going with it
it wasn't stupid like it is now like
when she first came out with the like
the diamond shit and you know the white
gloves and shit and like poker face yeah
like the crystal shit Turin it was cute
it was different she kind of look like a
superhero it was different now this
bitch walking around with the lunch lady
mole and the fucking black bangs like
which you are trying real hard to stand
out and in all honesty Gaga's image is
bigger than her music most people know
her they can name one song of hers but
they know her name which is cool then
which is good but it's about the music
when it stops being about the music
that's a problem because now you're just
an image you're not nobody cares about
Ciara is all in the tabloids and it
ain't for our music there huh because
she was getting her card or a scratch
show like shit like that like you're a
socialite now nobody cares about your
music anymore
so within the next ten years ain't
nobody on care in general and we're Gaga
she just she's too much and I think
people are tired of her I don't honestly
I think people are just it was too much
too fast like okay let's take the
evolution of breeding Britney came out
like a little slut because we love
Britney I'll get to Britney the second
two but she came out with her little
slutty face but it wasn't overly slutty
it was just not what other girls were
doing and then slowly but surely you've
seen her build up too damn near naked
so with Gaga she went from I'm a cool
different girl to a freak like a
bonafide freak is a good thing Adams I'm
saying freaking a point where is this
you you're getting so freakishly
different where you don't even look
normal anymore
bitch horns in your face is freak that's
like Satanist
that's a freak Richie will words just
got you about a chest but I just don't
understand like I understand you want to
be different I understand
artists are different so don't know
misconstrue that cuz we're in his car
all different but you are trying real
hard bitch you are trying real hard to
compensate because our album Born This
Way say what you want you got stands
y'all lyin cuz that shit's whack hey so
like she pays somebody by my house to do
them beats and she paid somebody else by
my house to do them songs and she
recorded and somebody by my house
basement and she put that shit out and
said y'all gonna buy it and y'all did
y'all brought it because what is Gaga
just like they say about Beyonce when
she do something wrong when she's still
something what did I say it all matter
because it's Beyonce been stealing is
stealing it's a very Ciara everyone over
here they would have been like you
that's bitch that's cuz the Sierra fans
are ghetto raunchy you don't matter you
no matter all of them are as a
disclaimer and not all of Ciara fans are
raunchy gonna know it's still basically
difference that they are playing
favoritism because when one artist does
it it's a problem
case in point back to Gaga Gaga sorted
out for $0.99 or Amazon and they counted
those record sales like nobody else's
but will Rihanna sold rated R for $0.99
they didn't count those so that's not a
thing or how y'all giving that shit's a
Gaga but y'all didn't give it to Rihanna
and we know Rihanna needed those who
knows you know I mean that's just fucked
up that charges y'all playing favoritism
because Gaga's hot at the moment so
y'all gonna let that be what it is and
that's okay as much as I love my artist
I can say with some shit ain't right and
that brings us to Britney now yeah I'm
ready
and recently Britney has not been doing
the Miss okay I mean she's still there
physically but that means God
and i think i don'ti in my opinion I
don't think she's fit 'mentally gone I
think bringing just mentally doesn't
give a fuck I think that's what it is I
think she's at that point where she just
doesn't care anymore now people want to
talk shit about Britney right now and
her to think I'm a defend her because of
this y'all gonna talk shit about us she
walking across the stage Debbie she to
hang it up flat screen she did this that
and the other but when Beyonce was in a
group and they were trying to get they
say my name on at the podium at the MTV
Awards and Gaga was laying at home on
her mama's couch Britney was on the bill
killing it so let's not act like this
bitch ain't never killed some shit and
you was up clapping that show house a
few years ago this mission of paying her
dues trust that Britney's been in the
industry since 16 she record our album
she was 16 she came out at 17 she 29 now
that bitches have been average 29 that
be just went up really so we know that
and that bitches paid her dues she has
the right to walk if this bitch went in
sit on a stage and eat watermelon I bet
every bitch who say something about her
be sitting there watching you does she
eat in water ballet why you watching it
bitch why you're like you don't like
greenie right but see that's people try
to discredit Britney cuz Brittany's not
a vocalist but Britney is a better
artist than most of these vocalists out
here that's what y'all fail to read like
forget it's not about talent anymore
it's more about imaging and who you have
behind you because Britney could have
simply been a flop artist but she had
the correct people behind her and
technicians behind her with an auto-tune
to make some of your favorite songs such
as toxic and I was talking oh don't try
to discredit Britney like she ain't
never did nothin and on top of all of
that above all else
Britney I don't understand how Beyonce
God's best
top-selling artists of the last decade I
don't think she got that I don't
honestly think she should've got that
that could have really what somebody
Beyonce top-selling artists no no whore
out you don't want and if somebody proof
this recently today be in flavor out
themselves cuz they be a fucking lie
they trying to say that I am such a
fierce so ten million records
No
yes Britney Spears has sold over 100
million records by her fucking self no
that no I understand that no group no
fucking backup bitches because it
honesty Beyonce this is what she did she
got she was in Destiny's Child she used
them bitches as a front and she was like
this is this is my competition
I'm the firm bitch of this when she got
the competition far down did she start
competing with the real bitches in the
game and I must say she did do a pretty
good job cool indeed but she still got a
long way to go I might say that she
still got a long way to go because as a
solo artist people love they called them
Destiny's Child selves as a solo artist
she hasn't done that much no no let's
just be honest no she's at hit singles
but her albums don't sell like y'all try
to inflate them and make them see see
only difference between Beyonce
Ashanti's Ciara Keri Hilson the only
difference is the simple fact that
Beyonce's had her father and her team
behind her pushing her shit to the point
where you don't have no choice but to
like it that's the difference see people
like elda keri hilson in her label
they're gonna fall back after our moment
of is they're not working hard daddy is
like we have money to me that's her
father he's gonna do when he has to do
because he's gonna check to so he does
yeah he was gonna check but he's gonna
do and I respect that I'm not mad at
that fact but y'all act like it was she
went through the game it wasn't cutting
throats in order you're in a very shady
ass way because I mean it was kind of
ironic that every time Kelly would come
up with something Here Come Beyonce
releasing a single off her album that is
like 2 years old really I thought she
was finished been chopped off Sasha with
their bitch why are you back so it's
little shit like that like people trying
to make it seem like she ain't in no
little unsavory ass shit back and forth
now Britney let's get back to booty real
quick I think Britney at the Billboard
Awards Britisher to satirize down their
whole time we shoulda had do the fuck
told her to get out there before
well I think you know what she did S&amp;amp;M
with Rihanna she opened she did the
world yeah yeah I like oh and I like
like her fucking music amazing vocalist
Britney is the best vocalist ever
no I'm not saying that by a long shot
ruining anything either okay but
Brittany got some good ass songs and
brainy can hold her notes see the
difference between Britney Oh Madonna
when it comes to saying it isn't
bringing us at least respectful enough
to say I'm gonna give you some auto-tune
to make this shit sound like something
could that be so flat it's raining
it Madonna's burning up and she did a
good job like and I just saying it cuz I
like Britney but she really did a good
job and I was like I listened to
Madonna's version it was so flat it was
so unanswered I'm a I guess in 80s
that's what they were doing that's fine
but you never aim and everything you
can't but you still can't say that
fuckin Madonna is the shit like that
no Madonna let me gonna be real I'll be
blunt the reason why Madonna is so
famous and so iconic like they say she
is right now is because at the time
there was no gaga there was no Britney
there was no Beyonce there was no Katy
Perry there was no Rihanna there was no
one like her so when you are different
you get labelled as she's a star because
she's doing something that other people
are not doing which is respect
I'll give them Adana and in that respect
but music-wise Madonna is just shit I'm
sorry no I will say I do like the song
by Madonna called American life I do
like that song
but I'm saying she's not an amazing
vocalist like that to the point where
people can fight it's saying Britney is
not a better singer than Madonna bitch
they both suck when it comes to failure
so what difference do it make no and the
difference between Christina's as we
talk about divas Christina ass can't
dance she can't even she gets seen you
got that little you know sex sex legs
you know like fuck me type thing going
on yes she could not anymore honey you
know she oh no but I mean she had that
doing the dirty thing when she was 20 so
what he wanted that time
she was nice she's nice 29 now a night
the mother I know so she can't be a war
anymore right that's why her last album
flies well she was trying to get she get
whorish in that album to get very very
whorish remember the video she was
happening crying in and she was having
sex with all about myself tonight
yeah yeah mommy but that's why I didn't
work because of the simple fact that
Christina tried to keep up with Gaga and
all of these other girls who are doing
this you know God I mean she's an
amazing writer and she has a beautiful
voice so that's why you know after you
plant that demo for me I was kind of
like puzzled like I thought my god I
wrote all the her stuff
oh wait the word Gitmo she wrote that
she wrote it for Brady I thought she
said wasn't I wrote that oh the girl
Britney singer no oh no that was okay
I'm like oh god Rosa Laveau's she wrote
it from Bernie Bernie indeed in one end
is because when I played it for you see
it was heavily honestly she's not like a
mechanic I mean under candy she's not
mechanical you know we don't really use
autotune and I don't know why you'd be
just act like greedy it just just
started lip-syncing I don't know what I
don't know why you motherfuckers act
like she just started that shit what he
was doing that shit a whole promo tour
at the malls Britney is the person that
actually like can trademark the fucking
phrase lip-sync cuz she's a person that
has been doing it the longest the most
every other singer prior to Britney
would out stage and was pretty even like
it makes me to make it like never
knowing all that shit while they were
dancing which I like personally but you
know tell me you like who you like
honesty and I want to bring this up but
remember at the MTV Awards with TLC
performed and they were doing they had
the black and checker dodge and remember
singing t anything and she lost her
breath she was like cuz I hadn't do it
you guys get what we're saying we love
all of these already's we fucked up
Archie I'm telling in general I love
Brandi okay
speaking of Brandi since we talked about
divas it's gonna make this video a bit
longer Brandi come on now let's see let
me tell you something as much as I'm a
baby I will say Brandi is one of those
artists that under every person that I
made previously they can't fuck with her
and I'm talking about in the musical
realm they can't fuck with Brandi
because Brandi may not be the best
dancer you know but what I will say is
when it comes down to music range vocal
abilities this range is something
totally different than other man I'm and
Christina included I'm gonna tell you
why Christina's amazing vocalists but
other women can do what Christina can do
a lot of people can't do what Brandi can
do that's the difference you know you
see what I'm saying
and your voice can be beautiful but if
people can do it it's not that great you
know it's great for what it is but it
doesn't set you apart
Brady's voice can never be mimicked by
anybody know who we're recording stuff
to you already know who am I said wait I
can't say it I'll say it after we get
off okay in my ear okay but why I'm
saying I'm Tamar females I was about
female well yeah
Brandy's boys is something that but just
cannot fuck with when you listen
ah you know I got some kam shit you know
no speaking to Kim let me just what the
fuck they want
yes we're gonna give you what you are a
bad bitch people's water will
additionally people just don't fucking
get it someone just fit this shit world
strange young kid oh yeah I think you
like this anyway do you think so okay he
was saying okay but let's just listen
okay little Kim had no issue with Nicki
Minaj copy and error just understand
this this is not interested yet and
people can say Mr Hammond is it is not
the whole homage thing neither this is
the issue and I may use me as an example
it's a lot of people on the internet who
love for copy cool I ain't got a problem
with that and the issue that I do have
is if you copy me to a tee and then say
I don't know you I never seen you before
I am inspired by you and you look just
like me so that's the difference
Nicki pay homage to Kim when she still
had her Ed Hardy on her long nails and
she was the old Nicki that's what she
paid homage to her when she took her
style and she started wearing wigs they
asked her where influences was and then
what did she say I know buddy great you
don't say although from all of the
female you know so basically you shoot
it on the woman that you was inspired by
and she wasn't going for that shit at
the end of the day is still a rap
there's still rappers this is what
rappers do the air like they two women
in a chair rappers bitch this is
entertainment okay
they both sold shit and for you bitches
talking about a little kit mr. PayPal
clean will Nicki sold her shit on PayPal
too so don't act like this is some new
shit and Kim was just you know it was a
it was a mixtape bitch not an album
there is a difference okay so understand
that this is what artists do because
when Nicki was on myspace selling our
album on PayPal and you get in free
posters you know nobody said anything
about this
okay I respect Nikki Nikki do you think
I am not mad at you mama get your money
all love Kim do your thing do something
right now cuz we missing you boo and
that's end of it y'all let that shit go
it's so oh it's like me fighting over
the Million Man March it doesn't let it
go if died so I'm off that way I want to
say this too like even though you know I
don't like any of the artists or we've
kind of feel a certain way about the
artist that is just no way mean that
we're hating on the artists like I don't
like these artists but I'm not hating on
them I'm just telling you my opinion
this is how I feel about the artist so I
shouldn't be Dean or any of us should be
deemed a hater because we don't like
what the fuck the artist does I'm sorry
like it they just don't we let our mind
we just write they don't they're not
that you don't agree your hair that's
not life goes on Twitter when you don't
agree with something you consider it
your hater is that I'm not a hater
because it like I said about Nikki I
respect your hustle I don't I'm not mad
in fact that you're getting money know
that I don't I respect who every fucking
you they money however the further they
can get however long they can get it I
don't have no issue with that you know
in that point no it's just that if I'm
not a fan of somebody because of their
music I'm not a hater I'm not mad I'm
not rest I'm not a bad bitch you know I
just don't like that particular artist
Madonna is selling records whatever we
say here is not gonna make no difference
in their pocket that's the difference
that you guys need to understand but you
guys give us that crazy and want to
fight because y'all ain't got nothing
else better to do y'all making Twitter
pages you know you are a raggedy bitch
when your whole Twitter profile is team
bitch team is bitch team that bitch team
I slay this all you do is fight for
other bitches and you get to receive a
check from any of these O's I love
Britney and I would defend her to a
certain extent don't talk shit bitch cuz
you was seeing a slave like everybody
else so you know and I'm not gonna for
like I wasn't thinking fucking Beyonce
then use me in love or crazy in love or
any of those dangerous Lee and
my Destiny's Child no one has a piano
anyway but I mean it's just you know I
was a Beyonce I was a destiny shelf i
got all the posters yeah we sickle I
used to fight horrible doesn't she'll be
a better than TLC you saw it was never
by the way bitch slam the door my face
and smoke the cigarette cause she was
just that distraught about the fact that
I said that so that just shows you the
intensity of how at the end of the day
you guys we don't know these people
the Britney follows me on Twitter I mean
Luke em follows me on Twitter
you know we speak briefly she makes me
happy birthday but I don't know her like
that you know you don't know Beyonce so
why you fighting somebody calling
somebody raggedy bitch and off they blow
up on Twitter because they don't agree
with the fact that her album is
considering why yeah you stupid ass
bitch like what particular person I'm
not gonna say his name because he's so
not important because he just makes
videos about you know should do another
video after this about all I can't even
say that okay so we'll do just sugar so

because I said that run the world sucked
and he dies basically tried to insult my
character like I was about to be so hurt
you know and it just like you says a lot
about you because you basically get your
YouTube views based on fiance's things

Italian it up but he tweeted me like you
really try to unity try to say you have
your stupid ass bitch you this you did

it's cute though I mean I wasn't
offended by a long shot because you look

me ugly you know
you know but people do they're like they
are you talking about their mother your
mother I don't call my sister so I mean
it's not it's really I think that's what
I don't like about it she doesn't seem
really because between everybody Rihanna

everybody because Rihanna say what the
fuck she feeling she don't care she'd be
on Twitter calling bitches out you a
stupid but she said you're wrong I'm a
cunt he doesn't care
and I like that about her Rihanna is not
the best singer but would she do shit on
is she she got 10/10 number-one hits
okay I'm bi I mean Rihanna's only been
fucking solo for five years oh god now
you're doing the rear east and stuff you
saying I'm not saying it cuz I
understand what I'm saying
I respect Rihanna for that Rihanna is
not the best vocalist but she killing of
