sitting down in my room but because it's
midnight
yeah okay so one question that I meet
like crazy from you guys is the music
that I used this is every single video
can you put the music can you put the
music can you put the music um so here's
the thing the music that I use often are
a lot of unreleased artists so for
instance one video I use Dane for which
is a group that Mila J used to be in I
used a Raz be songs I've used a crazy
amounts of songs so what I'll do I'm not
gonna make this part very long what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna play the song and
then I'm gonna give you the artists okay
if you can't find the song there's I
can't miss like a lot of my can't stuff
his stuff is either you find it on the
Internet but if it's not on the internet
I'm not gonna put it on the internet cuz
I kind of like know him so I don't want
to necessarily do that because it's a
reason where I was taken off so yeah the
thing with YouTube especially if I could
I would love to use a lot of my favorite
brandy and alia songs but the problem
with that is the copyright infringement
so what I decided to do years ago was
all of the songs cuz I'm a big music
person when I was growing up especially
in junior high school I used to buy
every single person's album so that's
why a lot of you guys ask me it seems
like you know every song knowing
the man is because music was my life and
especially during that time I'm not
gonna say that I was in a dark place but
I was just in a place of trying to find
myself so music was my outlet to allow
me to kind of express myself and it was
a no judgmental zone so music is
something that I'm very passionate about
that's why I like to use it that's what
I love to do intros that's what I like
to team stuff because a lot of the stuff
that I do you rather be dream Cleopatra
a Leah Brady voice than anything is
because these songs mean something to me
or these songs that I remember I'm going
to go ahead and play some of this music
that I have that a lot of these are just
songs he's probably a couple songs that
I've been asked like crazy about so yeah
so this first song
is touched by my kid
but the place where you do
yeah
I put the link to that below because
that is available the next song that I
am playing is a song by Kiki Martin who
actually it her name is here or she was
in a group called Isis okay oh no she
didn't is my jam but this song is called
the Mormons place
and I would put the link to that because
that is actually available or her
YouTube channel song that I've used a
whole bunch this song is called 3d by
Alicia Bellamy who was on daddy's little
girls with Angela Vanessa when that was
on she was on season one and that's how
I got to gets into her her what she was
but this song was actually her featuring
Soulja Boy so this is usually when I
want to be a little ratchet about it I
use this song I also used a couple of
her songs called it's a crime and I've
used a a few other songs which I'll play
after this and I'll put the titles if
you guys are interested as well
it's me
this next song is called curfew by at
the time his name was a little Johnny
but he goes by Johnny Manuel now and he
was around I got to know him because I
had a sampler at the time I was going to
when I was in high school and overwrite
the his promo team gave us templars for
his album and i remember those and they
went like frostwire and LimeWire was
breaking everybody's computer and
bearshare my friend actually found the
four versions which are now on youtube
so i'll put that entire discography of
his stuff to link as well
yes you are
and this is one song yeah I whoa it's
not even once on these several songs
that I used during my tutorial so the
song was it hurts like hell but it feels
like it feels like heaven hurts okay
that song is by an artist named sunny
ocean who actually is all more Ian's
brother who used to go by where's the
row name is alright alright and I
actually went to summer school together
and we didn't really know each other
like that we sat next to each other but
we didn't really know each other like
this so when you came out of course I
was a huge piece of cake finish you guys
know and I decided that I wanted to
support his album I love this album and
he decided to switch him engine they
both when they were together she became
the garden girl and he was sunny ocean
and these are the songs that came out of
it so these are demos like 60 red polish
I've used that so I'll put a list of his
songs um after this and play those - for
those who are interested
let's take a bad girl
one
like
Oh
so there's a song that is I call this
some very beautiful
I used it years ago and a hair tutorial
and people were asking me like crazy
most of you guys know the song from the
opening of Noah's Ark when Noah is
driving down Santa Monica Boulevard
so it's by her name is Misha lay Oh
something I cannot pronounce this
woman's name by a longshot but the song
is called very beautiful oh yeah
the song I actually received from a
friend so the song is not on the
internet so I'm not again I'm not gonna
post it what I would suggest that you
guys do if you really want song that bad
is I'll put her Instagram and her
Twitter below tell her that you're very
interested in the song link her to this
video if you like how you doing girl and
I will definitely if she gives you guys
the okay for me to put it up I'll put it
up but I ain't trying to get through one
song with two songs I forgot which is my
sister which is all oh my Chennai one is
Wonder and then the other song is
dancing me dance on me is actually on
her soundcloud and I will disown
though I will definitely link that below
cuz that's one song that I got crazy
amounts of questions about as well okay
so another song is this foam that I used
for the intro of the same wig from magic
hair company which is this and that is
by a duo named pharaoh and pharaoh is
actually a group with a lady that I went
to school with Ganesha and she is
singing I believe the second the second
verse of that song so the song is called
that step and you guys can actually get
that below so if there's any songs which
I'm sure they're gonna be that I did not
list in this video just simply tell me
what your video it is and then put the
time stamp of whatever song it is
because when I do tutorials I use a
plethora of songs so it's usually like
Orion I use about four songs in one
video for him and they were all his
songs in that tutorial so yeah if you
guys are interested put the lyrics to
the song if you can't to find the time
stamp or anything and I promise to God I
will let you guys know exactly what the
artist is and what song it is the reason
why I do not put what the titles up are
these songs in the intro is because the
companies use these songs I may use
these intros for a lot of times their
Instagram pages so if I'm usually doing
an intro for a wig or a hair of some
sort I don't like to necessarily just
put the artist I still put it in the in
the description which I guess I'll start
to do but sometimes the songs for the
most part are not available so me
posting it usually is just pointless
bolting so I hope that you guys enjoyed
this and again like I said guys have
anything snack me umm Instagram me send
me a DM or something to say hey I'm just
want to find this song that you have my
lyrics go better okay
as long it is usually I answer an
economist okay we usually act I usually
put the song and the artist in the
comments so I hope you guys enjoyed it
and I'll catch you guys in my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
