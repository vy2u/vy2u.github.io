different here this is going to be a
hall call bitch or you could bet so a
lot of times here on my channel I wear
it a lot of things in my videos and a
lot of you guys ask me where the
did you get that and I'm a person who
likes difference in our ageist and
ignorant news and all this good stuff so
I'm going to go probably down like the
five or six things that I get asked
often about what I'm wearing in whatever
the situation is I'm gonna use a couple
features here as example so we're going
to start off with this picture this
picture was a review for a week and I
were this nice velvet blazer and the
glasses so the Blazer that I'm wearing
is actually from the Balmain H&amp;amp;M
collection it is the woman cut blazer
and that is a dark dark blue and I
believe the retail price for that blazer
probably was about 250 because it's very
well constructed has the nice gold
buttons on it
it fits me like a dream and it's cut for
a woman but I got a smaller size because
I don't have boobs so it fit me great
and I just decided to not wear a shirt I
actually were the exact same blazer for
New Year's but of course I wear that
with all of the stuff that actually came
from the Balmain collection is that for
those shoes those shoes were actually
Giuseppe Zanotti my belt was
H&amp;amp;M for Versace one of the most acts
things that I think I've ever got on my
channel was about those glasses believe
it or not those glasses cost me $9 on
ebay okay so we're going to put
everything that I'm mentioning right now
a link to that will be below unless I
just simply can't find it
but overall you'll be good the next
thing that I'm often asked about is my
gold watch this particular watch which
you probably can't tell the end goal
I stopped g-shock watch I got as a gift
Oh
I think it was like the year before last
Christmas I got it and I've had it ever
since I actually got it off a site
called joy fresh and I brought it as a
gift to myself
for Christmas that I did so much that
year and I was like I really just want
something that I love and this watch
definitely is one of them I am still a
boy at heart and I love chunky jewelry
and ignorant things like such so I had
to get it but I believe that they it
might be currently sold out but I will
put the link below if you are interested
in any way shape or form so you can
actually get this watch the next thing
are these glasses that I am wearing
which are I wore these for my eyewear
glam review I don't know how long ago
that was a was like during a summer time
and I got everybody name I was like
where did you get your clear glasses
from I got these from uh eBay as well
and I believe they were like twelve
dollars so I don't really sky advise
missing sunglasses because I've come to
my next thing but I believe in saving
for things like such I would never pay
over twenty dollars for a pair of
glasses like this because a one day made
of the plastic and to even find them
somewhere
so I warm here which I thought that it
looked great with my all the pink that I
wore because I wore like I think it was
the wild fox Barbie stuff and I wore
pink um but they're comfortable I like
big shade speaking of glasses my next
pair are these glasses which I also wore
with my diamond virgin hair thing was my
curly hair and I also wore it in war
despair and sprinkling and um these are
my Porsche glasses and I believe I have
the biggest size now I'll put that here
because I don't remember what size they
are I just know they're huge and I
actually seen Rashida from love and hip
hop with these on and I did a little
digging in a little bit of research
because I just thought they were just
dope and I'm one for aviators but every
time I find it I find them they usually
are a little
I like my how those are they're huge
they come with two another pair of
lenses which are like a darker color so
you can use them as shades and those
blue ones do actually shave but they're
more you can see through them a lot so I
believe they retail for about $300 so
from from $9 to $12 or $300 it's the big
little however if you're interested in
those by all means kill them so the next
thing is I'm often asked about these
sweat suits that I love to wear on my
channel because they're very comfortable
and they're easy to put together and I
can show my stomach but I don't have to
be completely naked so I actually get
these from well I'll tell you this top
and this bottom I got from Urban
Outfitters the units are all a Calvin
Klein stuff in one section so I have
this in the white and I also have this
in the black as well I haven't weighed
weapon yet though but okay um and I just
think it's really cute when I I just
love to see be able to see this up under
the shirt um but the actual sweat suits
that I get I get them from Sorella
boutique which is by Heather Sanders um
if you are currently in California at
the Grove she has an actual store that
you can go in and try them on um a lot
of people are going to ask this question
I'm sure did my shirt come like this and
it did come cut like such it just wasn't
cut as high it was probably more about
here so I've chopped it so that if I do
this you can actually see the Calvin
Klein of other needs um and I think
these are using about the pair's is
about $70 but here's a tip usually which
is any type of holiday she usually has
this 50% off sale so when I got this one
I think a new white one because I have
wore one years ago um and it was white
but it was made a little bit different
than this one
I got another white one I believe I got
a black one and I already had two red
ones because
accidentally of them you know brought to
an accident and in shipping them uh but
I think I got all of them at some point
I think before I got with this one cuz I
got this gray I think I like a darker
gray the white one and the black one I
think it was like one it might have been
like 160 something versus them being $70
apiece so look out for that so if you're
ever if you live somewhere where the
climate is kind of hot and you want
something that's gonna try to keep you
cute but yeah it's going to keep you
know all the good stuff it is um but yes
available tickets where I got these from
and next thing people are asking me is
about this particular green army jacket
that I have and I've worked this but
I've never I think turned around but it
says Volda 92 went whore on the back and
this is actually from the rich which
they think in me something else I have
another jacket from them or have some oh
I have a beanie from them that I wore
years ago caught a hat on white it says
ain't no Miley um but that's why I got
them from they had sent me this and then
I didn't get to wear it on Valentine's
Day would I still have this I'm going to
wear which is this one or says instead
of happy valentine says happy Valentino
and um yeah I think this jacket they
actually have this really cute one like
this but it's all this is gold I really
want it but every time I go sold out so
you know so much about it
I don't have the jacket on me because
it's actually in my car but this jacket
which is my 90s R&amp;amp;B girl jacket
everybody their mom have asked me about
this jacket and I have been asked about
if people tagged me and like you just
don't get this jacket well I've been
having this jacket for quite some time
and I actually got it from a shop called
kinship and they make like they have
this like really dope Black Panthers
that I really really really really
really want and um
I'm contemplating because my shop is
giving out a hand right now you know
just I mean but um yeah that jacket I
get the most compliments on it has some
of my favorite 90 are me girls on it up
it's well-made is silk and it's lined in
silk and inside is pink and inside next
thing that I get asked a whole lot has
to do with my mouth um amor so my lips
what color combination do I use mostly
when I do nude lips in my videos
well I used Mac's chestnut pencil and
I'll use it to line my lips and I have a
tutorial on my everyday makeup routine
so you'll see more of this in that but I
used um the liner it's actually like a
ways in the liner to line my lips and
then I use my Kat Von D Noble and which
is my lip my liquid lipstick I use it in
the middle and then I blot and then it
usually starts to form this ombre look
um once I do it if I don't use the Kat
Von D then I end up using my wire sell
of new beige in the middle which is more
moisturizing because you know liquid
lipsticks are just really really drying
um but yeah I think I covered most of
the things that I'm asked about so far
so if you guys have anything else that
you would like to know um where I got it
from are you interested to know I think
I covered everything I don't think I can
wear my chain which is from the Swami
you know got to keep it eluded but other
than that I don't think I missed
anything um that I'm currently where my
hair is I work glam this is my 34 inch I
forgot which origin of hair this is but
the review link will be down below if
you are definitely interested in my
closure is from closure store so yeah I
hope you guys enjoyed this and
catch you guys in my next one please</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
