but I really do like y'all wanna see a
lot of side part going on cuz I got this
one to dressing it's one middle part
that hundred dollars so we're going to
talk about my hair which is from beauty
forever and I tapped his hair for long
enough to know how I feel about it let's
just say that okay so I want to start
off by saying it didn't come to color
this was the last little bundle blow the
last little piece of a bond actually has
left so this was probably my top bundle
and I didn't need it so I didn't use it
so I am wearing their zillion straight
darling
okay the length I'm wearing all 26
inches as far as my limp is concerned
and then it is a 360 frontal saw goes
all the way around
however I did not know when I wear my
hair straight like this item my brother
put I'm going to glue the back down to
it for what of the background of this
hair so you guys know I've done my lips
before which I titled melody and that
was a treat so I wanted to do a section
this time to see exactly how this would
look and I just tried this new bleach
that I'm totally obsessed with which is
which is the ion
bright white bleach which is a cream
bleach and it lifts up to eight levels
so I wanted to be able to get this look
what out happened to end up with bald
spots in my front cool because a good
taking that helps me I don't want it to
be able to lift this hair to this nice
like you know this classic honey blonde
eesh looking color I have another look
which of them was right there
which is like different levels of blood
and I use the exact same bleach for that
so I wanted to do that when I did melody
I used you know the b/w bleach and I
used for new volume I did the same thing
with this but the only difference is it
kept the hair more conditioned and
hydrated so it didn't want to break or
it didn't want to you know shagged crazy
or the whole thing so as you can see
it's captive situation billing so it is
this very Kimberly to do ask um unless
this was white I'm trying to see exactly
what I could do with this to get it to
that white that I got went ahead and
decided to just go ahead and do a
classic side part with a whole bunch of
waves on this side and then just kind of
section off my color to just fix in one
designated area so it's just in this
bang piece right here it's nowhere else
except on this side as well and I kind
of did the same thing the curls are very
basic I cut some layers into it and then
I went ahead and curls it and I just use
my super big rollers for the top that
are like this big so that it could keep
this volume here at the top no matter
how much I brush my hair it will not go
away so as far as the hair goes as far
as shedding goes I got quite a bit of
shedding and then I'm still in my left
using the high schooler method so since
I've done that I haven't got any and
then as far as the shedding goes when it
comes down to color when I colored it
and my frontal it was very minimal it
was what you would expect but it wasn't
nothing that was super duper crazy
and then when he came also because I'm
glued down on this side so if I pull are
about repositioned my part
baby's coming off and then when it came
down to my lace my lace was great the
360 was really great because a cane
Conakry plus for me but you can't really
tell because is literally everything
those that are here blonde so everything
is down you really can't tell and it's
not really registered on camera as good
as it looks in person I looking but I
like it better to person than it looks
on camera they don't know the process is
more like it looks or in real life
I have to read curl just the bang part
because as you can see like this it's
kind of failed at this point and that's
because when I did my pin curls on this
side
I didn't leave them in as long as I
could for the rest like I crossed he's
at two separate points I wrote the
blonde at one point and then this F so
all of this at the bottom this had been
curled and then I waited to the last
minute to do this so it's not it's not
really hidden so he follow me on
snapchat which is still malleable dog
facing you adult I took a photo curling
my hair I've never worked with your
company before but I can say this is
hair is extremely soft and it was able
to take and this frontal is extremely
nice and I think that they are doing a
great job I've seen a lot of reviews on
this company and I was like I gotta have
them coming up and I've been testing it
out I was learning to straight I wore
nothing like a but a high bun since I
like if you guys know I like to clean
with my heroine just to kind of test it
if I get sweaty with it or what it's
don't do it it's going here but it's
gonna be like so it didn't do anything
any other hair wouldn't have done it
ain't holds a curl very well which I
love and then if a lot lives to do month
if I can do a five part and kill it
which I learned in your hair and good
okay so you know and a lot of times what
happens is sometimes the frontal is too
big sometimes the hair doesn't want to
hold a curl sometimes the colors for all
all my bundles came in the same 1b color
as well as my frontal so it wasn't
nothing I was crazy or different there
and if I was like if I wanted to take
like a red or even a pink and put it
over this and you know but I was like I
liked it a lot and then I wanted to type
up to give you guys a real for Halloween
with this middle part in this middle
part like such I'm holding this because
I don't want it to come up I'm going to
video on how I put leg take down my legs
this one thing come out exactly like I
wanted to because I put it on wrong the
first time and because it's like I have
to make sure it's centered right because
there is a part right here it was kind
of more of a queue over here so I had to
like remove it so any come out the
second time exactly how I wanted but you
guys get the gist of what I'm saying so
beauty forever
because I really
she had no issues with their hair
because I did have the normal shading
which comes which is its standard well
when I don't have it it is really nice
so I will give them an eight because
yeah the shed is like I said it wasn't
crazy
me personally I don't find it as a huge
issue because all hair sheds like you're
not going to find here that doesn't shed
at all it's going to be even when you
first get in any watches you're going to
get like some shrimp it just happens
it's hair that's literally tied to a web
so it's going to happen but as long as
it's not like in my butt crack or it's
all in my food because that has happened
hey bozos so yeah I don't want that to
be my situation like ever that's not fun
that's not sexy I got no tingling as you
can see and these are curls that are so
bouncy is super duper super crazy sauce
and a lot of times when you curl your
hair depending on the company sometimes
you have to put so much hairspray in it
so they they can hold you end up with
making motors dry because you're trying
to get the curl to hole which then until
you pulling at your hair and then it
starts to get tangled and then you end
up with like a rat's nest so the fact
that this can hold a curl with no issues
and no problem is it's definitely a plus
for me this look is I don't know where
it came from I'm giving you very much
maybe guess girl 2.0 I don't know but
this top I got from forever 21 these are
the 102 pairs of black jeans I got and
you know I like to just lay the change
baby
but um yeah I don't want to do so I feel
like a hostess like what you want being
a normo sweetie if you guys are
interested in hair from forever beauty
make sure you guys that digits and below
if you guys have purchases hair let me
know
howlite if you did bleach over hair how
I did it get because this seemed like
the limit or where I could take him like
they don't seem like he was going to get
any lighter than this for disposition or
hair like I said I've done I've used
that bleach on other hair and it's got
like them your way so let me know what
level you know you guys were able to get
to with your hair and I was definitely
catch Shaw and my whole
and I put them really amazing coming up
so that's why I've been a little
bathroom because I've been really busy
but yeah hey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
