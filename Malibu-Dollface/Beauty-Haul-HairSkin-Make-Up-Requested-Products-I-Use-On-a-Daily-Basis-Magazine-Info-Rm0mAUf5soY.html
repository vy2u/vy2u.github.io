some products that I brought that I use
that I'm often asked about in like a lot
of messages at one time so this is kind
of just a chance for me to answer
everything all at once you and you know
like one sit in or whatever so we don't
wanna say before this okay you got of
course you guys know in B's closet for
the necklace who's gonna ask some people
were asking me in a few other my videos
where did I get my watch from I get my
watches from my girl here on YouTube mr.
Lima 77 which is our YouTube channel and
she has her own website called video and
blast 101.com
and she sells men's watches these nice
big chunky watches you guys know I have

well um and she starts the basketball
wives earrings and also make
up everything like beauty on blast
101.com is the ish and it's Tolima unit
you know so check her out if you guys
want watches the other necklace the long
when I wear with the different stones in
it got that from her too um so you check
her out so I think that's it so now to
the review okay so you guys know I'm
switching our products usually I go from
this to that to this today so figure out
what works best for me as well as you
guys ask me about stuff that I used on a
regular basis that I usually answer on
Twitter because it's easier for me to
answer what like on here I got so many
messages like it's just a headache and
don't email me on here just just don't
do it it's just too much okay so you
guys know last video I did about the
products that using my hair I told you
guys that I was using Giovanni's shampoo
and conditioner which I still I'm using
but big but I found something else that
works better as far as shampoo is
concerned because you guys know I got
that nice nasty and she scout and I got
drunk I got dry scalp I got dry skin so
design essentials therapeutic anti each
shampoo this stuff is just heavy like
you don't even understand how this this
it's like putting toothpaste on your
teeth and brushing that's how it feels
you don't even have to like scrub you
feel it the tingle the minty it's just
it feels so good it makes my ID in my
hair last night and you guys can see
from our part hair is clean clean lean
so yes this stuff if you have dry scalp
like myself this is definitely a plus
because it helps and just make sure that
after you use this though you do have
like a nice conditioner I still use my
giovanni's conditioner
so that's good now um you guys know I'm
big on the edges you know I feel like if
your edges is not under here my edges
are slicked like a bullet for real
um but people always ask me like what
are you use on your edges when your hair
straight do you still use gel like you
deal with your braids or what you know
no I don't cuz I don't like why would
you put gel on your edges of your hair
straight that's just tacky um let me
tell you now I've seen reviews on this
particular product and some people said
they didn't like it I don't know what
shoe did or what was know what your hair
but for me yeah I can only speak for me
this works which is the olive oil edge
control now y'all know y'all follow me
on twitter which is at malibu doll face
or on facebook which is still
overcapacity
um y'all know that i was bitching about
this product because I couldn't let me
just tell y'all what happened so I made
a trip to Walgreens because I needed to
go and I said okay for some other
products too so I said let me go because
they got edge control and by my house
they were charging like eight dollars
for some edge control which i think is
just ridiculous so but at Walgreens it
was only for I think for 69 so I said
I'm a ghost but I went really early
because I had a meeting to go through
that morning and I was like I'm alone to
Walgreens and then go where I need to go
but I was it was really really other
than I think the meeting was like at 7
o'clock so I was at warmer means I like
6:00 in the morning cuz the one where my
house is 24 hours so I went and dated
had every olive oil product but this and
I'm just like this is what I came for
like and they had the bins out and he
was like it looks like when they come
for they shipped in like another hour or
two then it's probably within one of
these boxes I have time to wait
so I went to my local beauty supply not
the one I usually go to but a different
one and they had it and it was only 5
5:49 which is like a dollar and some
change more so I wasn't tripping off of
that as long as it went eight dollars I
was good now
this stuff really works the consistency
of it it's like it's thick it don't drip
or anything
now this is similar to cue piece glaze
which I used to use QP and I'm gonna
tell you why I stopped one is sticky
it's terrible just sticky it sticks to
your pillow it sticks to your scarf it
sticks to your hair in the wrong way
QP Rylan would you like that and it
melts like if your body heat helps it
melt and it doesn't stay put it just
kind of moves around so definitely not
um not a big fan of that actually after
using this this is great it isn't turn
my hair some people said it turned in
here as she I don't I didn't turn my
shoes as she at all I used it all up and
down part um I just root stimulator so
yeah I mean it's all that it's organic
so I don't know what y'all did but you
know it works for me and all the other
reviews only see like two reviews that
were bad about this product I don't know
that they love QP out of whatever
well whatever words that's for me that's
for my personal you know what works for
my hair so it may not work for you I
don't know okay now people always ask me
um one of two things what did you do
what do I use on my face and what do I
use on my lips
um signal to the lips and it was like
this girl and her friend were like
haunting me on Facebook I love y'all but
it was kind of weird because she was she
kind of accent the same question how do
you get your lips like that pink color
without making it look so over P um so
what I use is lipstick by Revlon called
nude attitude and it's a new color
lipstick which looks like this
and on camera it looks a little darker
but it's not that dark it's about a
little darker than my chest
um so wasting my face I use this and I
used a pink color lip gloss which is
like this color
this is my Neutrogena is initial G no
more sunshine lip gloss it's like a
milky pink color which is in groove but
they don't make this anymore and the
reason why I still have this is because
I brought a shitload of them before they
discontinued this color I think they
have a color on with Neutrogena that's
similar to this but I don't know what
it's called so you would have to look at
this and judge for yourself but this one
is called rule so you you can I mean
they're hard to find still because I
discontinued them but I have a whole
like box full of these little tubes so
yeah these two together work to give you
this pink look it's a little muted right
now because I've been talking I was
eating and stuff
okay skin what do I use to wash my face
I used a cucumber dove bar soap that's
just for my face and to moisturize I
don't use lotion I use an appointment
which is usually made for scars scabs
rashes I had brought up two of it when I
got this tattoo right here and one day I
ran out of lotion and I was like I'm not
bout to get up and go get a lotion what
else can I use so I looked online about
like what else can you because I was my
face was it wasn't breaking out but I
was getting marks on my face and I was
trying to figure out what could I do so
it was like if you use an appointment on
your face it'll help moisturize and heal
your skin at the same time so for the
past I would say four months I've been
using Angie women on my face and it's
like you can see it is very clear so and
I have no concealer on I just have
foundation on and I don't have a lot of
it
so speaking of foundation your ante
ointment it comes in the tube um I don't
really think it no matter what the brand
is as long as it's medicated I think
you'll be alright
oh all right foundation um everybody
wants to know what I used for my thong
my foundation or whatever I don't use
Mac I really use next products and not
because they're expensive because money
is not really an issue
I just want results result is which
trying to get at the end of the
and to me Matt just does not do it for
me it breaks me out like I'm the last
person out of all of my friends who
breaks out so if your products breaking
me out something product I don't cook
and I'm not about to be paying all this
money for you to break me out so after
trials and tribulations trying to figure
out what foundation works for me and
what don't
I found that the only thing that works
to me is Iman Iman Cosmetics is the in
my opinion the best african-american
products for your face as far as makeup
is concerned because it's great coverage
it's inexpensive it's formulated well
and it comes off easily when washed off
you know like sometimes you wash makeup
off and it's just like why is this
foundation not coming off you know like
even if you use makeup remover sometimes
it doesn't always come off so I use my
color is clay one um it comes in a stick
like this which looks like a lot like my
Revlon - of lipstick but it's actually
foundation as you can see this fountain
this particular one is like gone but I'm
still scraping about I mean before I
open them on YouTube I mean I want all
my money worth you know all of it um
this right here is a mineral powder um
well it's second to none loose powder
it's not minerals but it looks like this
and inside and it's just to give you
like a little glow or whatever oh um but
yeah this stuff it works wonders it
isn't you know Rome or clothes or
anything it doesn't give me any issues
like I've been through trials and
tribulations with Mac like it's I've got
horror stories I don't even want to go
there Sam um now hairspray is something
that we all use well not all of us some
people don't use products in here our I
have to okay I am an african-american
of descent and we need to hold something
down okay so as far as Oh what do I use
to hold on let me get this
somebody asked me what do I use to flat
iron my hair because some people use
products and some people don't they just
do it after they put conditioner in it
or whatever and I used to do that and I
stopped doing that because I noticed
that my hair would get frizzy after
allowed and reverting it didn't work so
you guys I found this new stuff it just
it works okay it's called Cantu shea
butter Flatiron spray this stuff smells
so good but it works so well and I don't
know if I'm using this correctly but
judging by my hair I used it correctly
because if I didn't use this my head
will be poufy right now okay and it's
like pin straight right now it moves and
all of this good stuff you know and what
I do basically is I take it it's like an
aerosol you know you take it you spray
it I did it in each section I sprayed it
in each section instead of spraying it
all over because I know it was quick dry
but it's made with real shea butter and
it predicts against um he damage and
pretreat hair and you got to use a wash
dryer don't use it wisely so yeah it's
like a um a heat protector too so this
is a good thing like this really works
and I believe this is the African
American product as well um I know they
have oil sheen too but I didn't get the
ocean because I don't use oil sheen in
my arm um so yeah this right here for
your flat irons good because it keeps my
hair pin straight um and I did my hair
like two o'clock this morning and it's
only it's 12:00 and afternoon right now
and my hair has not frizz up or anything
it's still yeah and the fact that I
 like pressed the hell out of my
hair probably helped too so yeah this
works okay now another heat protector
just in general like after I blow dry my
hair because you guys know like all my
sisters you know it's some of my
brothers who you know Flatiron and
Preston here too you guys know that we
have to blow-dry Perez and
on our hair that's a lot of heat in your
hair and I do my hair like every
sometimes is every week because I just
it just starts in a my Scout girl so um
and I just I like my hair to be fresh
though you know like I like it's not
fresh like oh I'm cute but like fresh
like I just freshly got it done so I do
it like every week - every week and a
half not every two weeks which is not
good but this heat protector right here
does help my hair from stop breaking and
it's the fantasia hair protection
straightening certain and this stuff
works really good and also helps you
keep your fly aways away and it had a to
protect you against the Sun so this
stuff works really really good um this
bottle was like I don't know it was it
wasn't that much but for all of this
that's in here I'm sure this'll last me
alone so y'all see my other storm that I
showed in the other video still got that
after about two years um and what do I
use like on my eyes cuz I really don't
like to do heavy makeup but like I'm not
a big fan of heavy makeup and I noticed
that when people do have your makeup on
me either I look like one or two things
a Barbie
a not-so-great Barbie or drag queen and
I'm not trying to look like either so I
use this arm which is Maybelline the
falsies volume express mascara and this
is for false lashes but do I listen no
the brush looks like this and it works
really good some people I know had
issues with getting this off but um I
noticed the people that issues with
getting this off was like you were using
this like you were using soap and water
he was use makeup remover be smart okay
don't be retarded so anything anything
anyways they're all the products I have
for you right now but I do have other
products um that I will share with you
guys in the future but I did want to
bring that to your attention because all
these things that I showed you actually
work pretty good for you
