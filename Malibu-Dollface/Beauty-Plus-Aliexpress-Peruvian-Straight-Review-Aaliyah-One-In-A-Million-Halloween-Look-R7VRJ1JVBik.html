Oh
okay first and foremost we're gonna take
these off because they're going to drive
me crazy it was different with the music
but it's really tough yeah okay so I
hope you guys enjoyed my tribute to a
favorite singer my biggest Idol alia
okay and um yeah I decided to do this
look with this hair let's move it out
the way so you can see what I really
look like okay um with this hair from
Beauty plus hair this is their straight
hair and this is the front tool I am
rocking great if I'm not mistaken and I
am rocking four bundles I'm rocking 2222
a 20 and 18 and I believe that my
frontal is also an 18 inch because they
get it kind of met now the layers that
is in there um was definitely uh the
one-in-a-million video was my blueprint
for how how I pretty much cut this and
how it came out um her hair in the video
which I'll place here okay let's do this
we can do kind of a side by side I guess
um her hair in the video she had a lot
of layer here in the front and as I'm
watching the video I'm noticing they're
just layers central and during the 90s
during the 90s this is what everybody
had crazy amounts of layers
everybody's here was pretty much simple
into the point because her clothes
Connor was their expression whereas
Tinnell most of us use our clothes and
our you know our style as an expression
in our hair is just kind of like
afterthought like I'll put a cute outfit
together and be like okay I'm just gonna
work hard and call it a day
so our hair was definitely her
silhouette so I wanted to do that so as
you can see I put on my nice sweat um
you guys know it back in 2014 I did I
was a Lea for Halloween and everybody's
asking me to do it again and I'm not
going to do it again only because um I
like these girls up here have a good
time that during October I'm something I
see a lot of good costumes and other
times I don't see so many great ones but
again it's all about paying attention to
detail and it will help the best for
your custom now this is a frontal that
I'm rocking and I'm gonna put my head
down but if I go like this you can see
my cap slipped all the way back after I
got to be glued down so just keep that
in mind this video don't think my Scout
looks nasty Annette I did my makeup a
little bit lighter than usual just
because I wanted to be as close to her
complexion as possible come on don't do
that thank you thank you so as far as
shedding goes with this hair I'm started
off by saying that this look this hair
has held up really well with the
shedding I cut a tremendous amount of
hair off because her hair when I was a
kid IRA being a little boy I'm watching
the one-in-a-million video and thinking
that Lea's hair was so I'm like oh my
god her so long now as a grown-ass man
I'm wearing 40 inches and she probably
had the longest she had was probably one
one bundle of 18 okay so I'm just a
little flabbergasted that as a kid I
thought it was so long so I tried to
keep his hair as 22 as possible while
trying to stay true to what her look was
so what I did was I went ahead and just
layered the front so that the front was
a little bit longer she had more of a
blunt cut at the end but I just I can't
do the blunt cut unless it's a bob or
short I just I just can't do the look um
if this was a Halloween costume I
definitely would have went ahead and did
the look
but because it wasn't it was just
literally for this review um I just I'm
definitely gonna use this way for
something else and I don't want it to be
so short okay so everything is I mean
it's super duper straight and when I got
it it was more so um it it was straight
but it wasn't crazy straight but it's it
like literally just one pass from the
Flatiron and baby went right back to
with it no it definitely does have that
virgin poof to it so I have to watch it
I don't know how this hair would fare
and this type of weather just because I
know for a fact that when I was wearing
this quite often this hair was during
the summer months so it was cold in the
summer like it didn't like when it's
humid it was fine but I don't know how I
would do at night you know I'm saying
like Hollywood be if the cold kind of
hit it because I've been wearing it as
of recently but I haven't Ward like a
night on the town I'm gonna be honest
which I just haven't now cutting this
was easy because my frontal was my guide
so I just used my frontal as a guide and
cut all the way down on this side and
then used it as a guide and cut it all
the way down on this side so alia was
definitely known for her layers she
there's a picture where she's like
laughing with a pink hat on she's got
like a pink hang on and it's just layers
enjoyed it is so beautiful and people
forget some of the simplest styles are
the most classic and I believe that this
style was great for her and how we
remember her because it's a silhouette
of who she was so if you just like block
my face out then it would feel you know
you get an essence of her in this
another thing I did was put on some
slits cut a wife-beater I just brought
and put some white eyeliner on my belly
button cuz she had like a belly button
ring Koosh but it was kind of folk cause
I don't believe she ever had her a
billion pairs so I just it worked honey
you believe the intro right um I
couldn't find my a chain I know you know
the the hardcore alia fans are gonna
stab me in the gut because I don't have
a chain on with this whole look but I do
not know where mines is you guys know
back when I did
I did have one but I couldn't tell you
where that is this is my classic look
you guys know me so much for because
this is the look that I wear often you
know it's very if I go like this then
this is definitely a look that I wear on
a regular basis ain't nothing really
different but it's just something about
a very neutral makeup and you take that
hair and you put it across your face and
then you turn it into somebody
completely different um as far as the
color goes I was gonna do a brown this
time alia was doing a little bit of
brown here a little bit of ombre she was
the first person I've ever seen with
Umbridge by the way and I was gonna do a
little bit of ombre at the bottom but I
just for time reasons and restraints I
did not have the time to do it but um
and then my makeup I just did this
eyebrow is definitely her eyebrow okay
because hers was mama was not playing
this one is mine's I just kept it simple
stupid
um I did a little bit of liner um a
little bit in the inside and she had and
then I just lined up got on my lips cuz
in the 90s you wasn't nobody unless we
could see your damn lip liner just
saying um but Beauty plus hair gets an A
plus plus for me because I legit have
had no issues with this hair and I'll be
honest with you there is two packages of
hair I just sent back as it was quite
durable and that was after three months
but yeah is this
I'm loving so you are you know if you
looking for a last-minute Halloween
costume you happen to be a little fair
and even if you ain't that fair
did you just really love alia and and
you you you are our Rd fan crooner and
yeah
just go ahead and um white white beater
and a chain and get it anywhere some
white pants dot put the hair over your
eye
grab them loud-ass bangles and put on
shoes from Chase and you my dear have
become the princess of army early so I
hope you guys enjoyed this because I
definitely enjoyed
is um I don't know if I would do any
other looks although I will say this
because I got a few 360s that I'm still
playing around with um I might do a
Leah's look from Romeo Must I wish I had
like a ponytail the treshold a ponytail
with sideburns I think I'm gonna try
that so that might be the next Aaliyah
look that I do and if you guys have any
suggestions cuz I get this a lot which
is crazy because I feel like her and I
look nothing alike like right now I just
feel like myself dressed as Aaliyah
but when I do see pictures and I looked
at the footage for the intro back it was
a little scary so if you guys are
interested in me doing more look space
on the great late alia let me know and
which look do you think that I should do
and I'll catch you guys in the next one
shout outs of a beauty plus because they
were very patient but it was great
because their hair is amazing
see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
