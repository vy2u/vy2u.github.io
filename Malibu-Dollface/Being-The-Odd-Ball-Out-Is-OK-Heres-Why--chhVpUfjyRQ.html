oh yeah what's that
I would like Little Red Riding Hood
today you know like Grandma um but yeah
this particular video that I want to
talk about is for the people who just
feel like they just are so misunderstood
that no one gets it
and I often feel like this like I often
feel like I am such in a box that I
can't get out of no matter how hard I
tried to knock
buna box I end up in one and I had to
come to realization that it's it's not
me it's a society that I live in the
society and that I live in um you know
where this is the thing that that kind
of throws me where brought up well most
of us were raised to be individuals this
is what your parents want you to do they
want you to grow up to be an individual
to do what you want to do and how you
want to do but yet and still they try to
dictate certain things that don't need
to be controlled so that you'll do what
they want you to do so basically a lot
of parents will contradict ourselves and
it's not a bad thing because they're our
parents and they want the best for their
children
which is true um some parents have just
a control issue I know a few I won't say
any names but I know a few um well they
want everything to be their way and
that's just face it that's not practical
you can't have every single thing you're
away anything that is gonna work because
it's just not it so um basically I told
you guys I've ran down my story of how I
came out and you know how I got to the
point where I am today
but even today um I'm often put in a box
that I don't want to be in I'm off then
labeled something that I am NOT all
because of the fact that I choose to
take a different path that is not
what someone else necessarily sees as
different they cease as oh that looks a
lot like this or that's kind of similar
to this I'm gonna just call you that no
it's just you know so what I want to
really really say in this video to just
anybody who's going through this just
continue just please continue to be who
you are if you are the funny morbid
individual and you don't have a problem
with that continue to do it if you are a
person who is infatuated with purple and
you look like Barney every day continue
to do it no matter what the situation is
just please continue to do who you are
because the issue that I'm facing today
is that no one has individuality no one
I mean I though I'm just I'm just not
like that
um I am an individual within myself and
there are other people that I know who
are very individual of what they do but
there are also other people who fall in
the category of been there done that
seeing that um and it's just kind of
like why do you continue to do what we
already seen someone else do and you're
so gung-ho about it now don't get me
wrong there are people who like certain
things and they want to emulate and do I
am a avid fan of alia I have been only a
fan since I was what seven you know so
there's a lot of things that I do that I
emulate from her you know but I do try
my best to make it my own you know I
don't go out and Tommy Hilfiger boxers
wear baggy jeans with a tube top with a
big ol jacket on and some Nikes and put
my hair in the swoop and be like oh I'm
being myself
no you look just like her like that no
you know but it's okay to pull elements
from people but when you sit up there
and I see it a lot on Facebook and
Twitter with people who dog people out
because they've sent back and they've
done something that someone else has
done but the nature I run to do the same
thing and they say oh because I added
this color to it it's mine know which is
a color it's if the color is
nice fat you didn't change shit but the
motherfucking the RGB bitch like for
real
so I mean somebody's vacuuming right now
I just fucking it my whole little
concentration but yeah um there I think
they recommend inside the apartment
um yeah so my issue today is this
everybody wants to be so different that
everybody looks the same so fail because
it isn't watered like it just does not
work if it's like okay you it's for
friends let's just scenario it's for
friends okay it's like bitch we gonna
all look different let's go out to the
club this bitch put on a black dress
this bitch put on a long black dress
this bitch put it on a black top and
some black pants and that bitch put on a
whole black jumpsuit or Whomper if you
would y'all don't look no different you
look like a motherfucking group y'all
look like Destiny's mamas there's no
difference so I mean that's the issue
that I'm facing today as far as people
are concerned is that nobody takes the
time out to necessarily think about what
individuality really means and what it
is to just beat you like whatever it is
that you like and you can do just do it
some people will be like oh I want the
study jacket I want to look like Gaga
I'm gonna look like Nicki I want to go
look like Miley Cyrus
I won't look like Britney circa 1998 I
wanna look like and she should be like I
want to look like me I want to take the
influence that everybody that I just
named gives me and come up with
something that is insert name here that
is what you should do that is what
should be your niche you should be the
and when I do see people do this I
commend them so much because it's so
rare it's like seeing a dinosaur it's
just like damn bitch you did it you did
it I'm seen it and so long bitch you did
that shit you know because it's just
like you don't see this often at all
because people are so used to just
simply falling back
following trends but then when a when
there are people who do shit that is
totally out of whack everybody got
something to say about it and it's
usually negative if you suck he got on
what the fuck she got on I don't give a
fuck what it is there shit that people
do that I don't agree with I think it's
ugly but there should that I do that
people don't agree with and I end up on
failed blogs and shit for do you think I
personally give a fuck no because I'm
gonna continue to keep doing it because
I am not here you're not here nobody is
here to please other individuals that's
the thing that you guys need to realize
about life you're not here to please
everybody you can't please everybody for
every superstar there are supporters and
for every superstar
there are haters okay and I'm not gonna
say haters like they hate on them but
they just don't like what you're giving
okay so you have to take the bad with
the good and understand that because
there's a line of people who don't like
it that don't mean that you can't do it
there are a lot of people who have a lot
of confidence in this world that end up
on disrespectful blogs like no way girl
and fail calm or whatever I've been on
these sites you know but it only makes
me stronger as an individual because
what I'm doing is making people
uncomfortable and when something is
different it's scary
that's bottom line wait what you don't
understand what the unknown is scary to
people don't unknown a shit that makes
people just be like comfortable and to
take somebody I think comfort zone is
where I just I feel alive when you never
seeing when people can't tell if I'm a
guy or good that day really just I'll be
like mmm you're just you know it's a
game you know but who else can do that
you're not I'm saying you're just like
dang you got something that everybody
else don't have you know so is if you
have that niche
that's able to make people so what the
fuck phases which you always want from
somebody when you're doing you that's
that's when you know you did you when
they give you that you did that shit you
did it no matter what you did that shit
rather their reaction is bad or good you
still did what you were supposed to do
and that is be who you are okay and that
lets other than other people know that
it don't matter what the hell you doing
you're gonna continue to do it
regardless of what the fuck they have to
say they have to say yo mama gotta say
yo daddy gotta say no because you at the
end of the day you're gonna be who you
are
you can't change that the more you hide
it the worse it's gonna be
the more you suppress it the more
unhappy you're gonna be with life and
you just in life you know when you
conform you something that is not you
that's why everybody knows that I have
no tolerance for men who are on the deal
um I know you guys heard recently I
think his name is Ronald I don't know
his last name
I don't know he worked for CNN um I
believe he made some very um derogatory
remarks regarding the Superbowl ad with
David Beckham Schwartz gay people some
people thought it was a bit blown out of
proportion and shouldn't have been said
and all of this other stuff that's what
that's that you know I personally didn't
think that it was necessary you know
when you can see you can sit to keep
pointing out something about a group of
individuals it's one or two things you
have a serious problem with these people
and you experience something that's not
necessarily a positive thing or they're
doing something about it about that
would no good tape it back they're doing
something to your psyche that's fucking
with you personally
and for me when he said what he said
which was if you got any homeboys
looking at this David Beckham at uni
think you slapped him across the mouth
or something along those lines and
nobody said anything why are you talking
and this is not what you like why you
why he's arguing let me know that
shouldn't even went through your mind
the fact that any man thinking about
anything about this man and his drop
shit and went to your mind that lets me
know something that you are doing is not
correct period so therefore people like
that I can't stand
I don't do but that's it if that's
already been down that road jarred and
already been done in a road but you know
I'm you know I'm just I have a very low
tolerance for people who are not
individuals today do you don't be scared
2012 it's not 1812 okay nobody's gonna
hang you and burn you at the stake
because you decide I'm gonna do but I
want to leave I'm a girl but I'm gonna
shave on my hair off I'm this but I want
to do that they're blurry the lines I'll
do it every day and I get commended for
it every single day everybody's not
gonna like it but I can go to sleep at
night knowing I am Who I am I love Who I
am I'm not gonna change who I am for any
one because all the other shit that
people are doing to just be stuck in
this box and everybody is just blurring
together be that individual like myself
and many others who will stand out in a
crowd no matter what I have won no
matter what I look like no matter what
time of day it is no none of that do you
it would not hurt you it will not hinder
you it will make you a much happier
person individuality is why we were put
here let's use it okay let's stop taking
what someone else used as individuality
and making it ours do what the fuck you
want to do now if you want to wear my
fucking Christmas bows all year round do
that okay do that shit if you want to
wear rollerskates all day to it I'm not
gonna talk about you
may look at your strange but I'm not
gonna talk about you because just
because it works for you doesn't mean
it's gonna work for me and just because
this works for me it does not mean it's
gonna work for you
find what you want to do do it and we'll
be in a happier place okay but I do want
to come and say that to you guys because
um you know it's rare today and sitting
on Twitter and seeing kids you know that
hit me up and say you know you're my
inspiration and I want to be just like
you when I grow up in in a way I cringe
because I never want no one to say that
they wanna be like me you know I'm not a
perfect individual you know and I never
said that they said that I was you know
but I just basically want kids adult
whoever to take from these videos that I
do something with them in this video I
want you to take that no matter who the
individual who the individual is never
want to be like that person always
aspire to be something close to that
person or something similar and in being
so you end up becoming yourself you get
what I'm saying never want to duplicate
what someone's already did you want to
take what that is that you like about it
apply it and make you and you can be
something very great in this world if
you only allow yourself to be okay I
look like a cry kid if I do too like you
got they know so yeah that's about it
I hope everyone is good I'm doing very
very good um I have a lot of stuff going
on as you guys know right now Malibu
kids are my apparel and stuff like that
is available on my level kids online.com

bar and a video link to that particular
video as well and I believe that that's
