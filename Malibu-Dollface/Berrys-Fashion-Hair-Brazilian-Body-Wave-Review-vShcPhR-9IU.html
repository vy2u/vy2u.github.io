hair right now okay which I wanna call
this hair like candy yum-yum because I
feel like this is it's not the exact
color clearly and on camera it looks way
off but I promise y'all like in person
it's a little bit closer than what it
looked like but it's because it's like
my hair is pink this is pink well this
is more like the color and this is a
lighter pink I was gonna change it then
like my bowl my highlighter is like it's
moonchild all of them you know there we
go so my hair is from berries from
berries 1 2 % virgin hair okay so
berries fashion hair and this is what it
looked like when I received my bundles
they came in this box and then my
frontal actually came in this container
so I kept all of this for y'all so this
hair clearly I wish she came this color
but it didn't
I'll take my visor off and it's thank
you for those who are gonna ask me with
visor this is this is the visor that
Nicki Minaj wore is Alexander McQueen
2012 collection but she just kept
wearing hers like this if you find ones
that look because they really hard to
find I got mine son like 2014 I think
and haven't rewarded him so I will say
why not
so to my bundles this is originally body
wave and I told y'all in my last review
that the body wave that I was about to
do was nothing like that this is what I
mean I
absolutely nothing like that so this is
let me get my bundles right because
y'all know I struggle with that I always
forget 20 22 24 and a 16 inch pre plug
frontal frontal which is a thirteen by
six so that's what our part is all the
way back here so what I did was I went
ahead and bleached his hair with the ion
bleach Kajal notice my jam and I used 40
developer on it I left it on for 40
minutes my hair turn like you know like
a classic blonde think like Cher from
clueless like that and then I used two
colors on this hair I used one which was
called an is all they're both the door
it's neon pink and then blush pink my
hair as failure was real cute and
quaffed before this but I shot my intro
first though here's a little loose black
in so yeah so I'm gonna stay like this
far back with it I my color ran all of
my frontal y'all and it really just
jacked the damn frontal up so my
hairline is pink which is knock you and
so I got the visor but if you don't plan
to do this with your hair and you just
plan to or if you do plan to do color on
it just be careful because staining your
lace is like the worst thing and I could
not get the color off to save my life
but I loved how this came out so I'm
probably going to cut some bangs and do
it just so you gain tail so my
experience with the hair because it is
only three bundles and my frontal is so
long I was like this could be something
a little bit different that I was used
to so I went ahead and plucked it a
little bit more but by that time the
color had because I set the color on my
frontal y'all and then usually I do it a
particular way if you look back and some
old videos I had a video where I have
blue hair it was like like almost cobalt
blue hair but none of my roots or were
blue and that's because I did it a
certain way this I actually when I did
this
see of the color because I like to cut
it with conditioner it ran and seeped
into my lace and I didn't notice because
I was doing other hair at the time and
yeah it kind of ruined it which pissed
me off but before that happened the
front school was really really nice okay
the frontal popping is 13-6 is very full
and because this is only three bundles
and my frontal is so full it doesn't
seem like it's not enough hair so you
know Yahoo I am honey like six to eight
bundles but this didn't feel like that
it definitely felt like it was just
enough for what they gave me the hair
quality was also really good due to the
simple fact that after I bleached it and
I left it on for 40 minutes it did not
shed like a mangy dog and my hair still
does this it can still hold a curl it I
was able to cut some beautiful layers
into it it took the color very very well
I'll never work with berries um fashion
hair before but I would like to work
with them a little bit more frequently
due to the simple fact that they quality
of their hair for very inexpensive hair
seems like they're on par and they know
what they're doing you give it I'm
sailing sometimes what happens is when I
tried this with other hair is a complete
and utter fail I did a strand test with
this as soon as I did it it was perfect
I woke I just gonna take color with no
problems so the fact that I was able to
lift the hair to this magnitude and not
get any shedding and then I was able to
put the color and deposit the color like
such this is amazing look how beautiful
that is
okay so this is some of the blushing
pink and then a lot of this at the
bottom is more of a neon pink so
youngsters your homes my only downside
which was not their fault it was mine is
because my damn frontal looks like I had
and I'm so mad at myself for doing this
like I've been doing this too long to be
in this situation so I'm very sad about
that but because it is a thirteen by six
I made in this all of this space I can
actually cut my bangs from back here and
kind of just bring them like such start
to have like a My Little Pony situation
going on which I don't mind at all
but I really wish I would have paid
attention that's what you're doing too
many things at one time so yeah y'all
definitely get a ten out of ten for me
because I have no issues with this
whatsoever let's look at bonus is I was
at the store earlier and the girl was
like oh my god everybody's doing because
y'all know I'm over the damn pumpkin
spice hair I am over it everybody in a
mama is amber off copper wooden animal
whatever I am so over that so grow now
so if you guys are interested in this
hair this is body wave I am wearing 20
22 and 24 with a 16 inch lace 13.6
floral from Barry's fashion hair hit the
links below and I will catch y'all in
the next one I just wanted to do
something that wasn't predictable
because everybody's doing the same color
everybody is chestnut orange chestnut

with a home girls I'm so over that so I
decided why not do pink and of course
you know check on it was all our jams
