that this is a silk top unit so it's a
four by four as well and the density is
120 okay you guys it's like extremely
hot so we're gonna make this quick I'm
gonna do a review on this wig I have one
from best lace wigs and I'm sure you a
lot of you guys are familiar with best
lace wigs because most of everybody on
YouTube house has done a review most
booty Beauty most beauty gurus have done
reviews for best lace wigs um this wig
that I have on is the number let's see
cuz they just put it on the box I think
it's a or w SW 0 4 SS I'll put it in a
title um and of course he came with the
classic best lace wig box that it's like
a drawer and then when I got it it came
with this plastic bag they had the wig
in it and his net hat the wig I mean was
around the way this is the the tax that
came with it and I think it is a SW 0
for 8 I don't know if it's 8's RSS
whoever wrote this did not do a good job
um this is the lace that came around the
front that I did cut off which looks
like such and away came in this box when
it was delivered I mean it came in a DHL
bag but this was the box that was in the
bag um and then it came with these two
caps which actually is for cuz it's two
in each now to think that I understand
about these these wig companies is they
they send us African Americans
these dark caps and my scalp is not this
dark so I if I wanted to work because
this is a full lace wig so if I wanted
to wear this in like a ponytail or a
park all the way down the back I
wouldn't be able to because yeah my
scalp will still look like so it would
just be like the feet purpose so I mean
there is a a skin color one on the back
which would be great you know you could
send me that one you know
but I'm not tripping it they caps I
don't like I said I don't wear my hair
to the point where it would matter
anyway um so the specs on the wig it is
20 inches I believe this is Chinese hair
I think I believe this is a Chinese hair
but it's just not processed its virgin
Chinese and it's silky it's a silky
texture because it's really soft like
SuperDuper soft it's 20 inches and it
did not come like this I got it it was
very straight it was at the top of it
was very big you know how will you get
lace wigs they'd be like real tall at
the top it was like that um so what I
did was I did what I usually do on any
you know my curling methods I layered it
and then I curled it I flexi rotted it
and then I took flexi rods out and I
just combed it out um but yeah it hasn't
given me any issues it takes a curl very
very well the only downside I could say
about it well we forget to that um it
has the it has two combs right here and
adjustable strap in the back and it you
know it has a nice little pool top the
hairline on it is good it's pulled
behind my hairline so it's actually
right here as you can see now the only
thing I don't like about it is it is
thin and you guys know I like I'm one
for a lot of hair but this is just a
little too thin for me because this is
what the bottom looks like after I
layered it because remember it was all
one length when I got it when I layered
it um you know this was what the bottom
half was left like so a quick fix to
that is just taking it and sew some lip
hair in the back which I did with my
other one so I mean there you go it's
not gonna make a difference in this wig
will be perfect but the fact that you
would spend a certain amount of money on
it is so anyway the fact that you would
spend you know over a hundred dollars
for wig that's not that full it's kind
of that's the only downside because it's
a beautiful unit there's a beautiful
hair but they need to learn how to put
more hair at the bottom and stop putting
so
much at the top because I've noticed
what a lot of wheat companies it's a lot
of hair up here which makes it bulky but
it's not enough at the bottom to make it
fool so that's the only downside I can
see about it the luster on it is really
good it's really pretty you know it's
not you can wear this anybody wear this
to work you wear it to the club you know
the curls are gonna hold or whatever but
it did take I had to put some structure
in it because when I first got it like I
said it had nothing in it it was just
you know people think that when you buy
these wigs and you try them on and you
don't like them is because of the simple
fact that they're ugly or something it's
like you have to work with them cuz I
had to cut this to my face it didn't
come like this and I'm sure if it came
cut pretty cut it still wouldn't look
like this because of the simple fact
that I needed to frame my face not a
general person's face so you remember
that when you buy these you have to work
with them they're not gonna be like this
straight out the pecs they're not gonna
be exactly what you want straight out
the pack you have to put working but
they do last and that's the good thing
about it um I haven't washed it this is
straight out the pack I haven't washed
it yet but I will be putting trucks at
the bottom only because I it's just
necessary um but I do I do really like
it I can't really besides that one hang
up there's nothing else that I don't
like um but if you're not looking to put
trucks in your wig or whatever or you
want to wear with a part down the middle
this one may not necessarily be for you
and due to the simple fact that yeah
that is not the business but if you
don't mind throwing about four trucks in
it you'll be just fine
um cuz when it falls it's gonna fall you
gonna because it looks real full at the
top you know but it's just the bottom
it's not full um so that means I would
have to recut the layers in the front
when I put the tracks in the back but I
wanted to come with nothing in it so
that you guys could see exactly how it
was straight out the pack after are just
pretty much cut it and I will do a
tutorial on how it's a layer and cut and
stuff like that since a lot of people
have requested that I do such a moving
um but yeah it came through DHL I think
it took about three days and in no
problems you know so it came it came
really quick connect him they come from
China as well so if
I came from China to him that quick was
great for me um but yeah I've concealer
right here as you guys can see I have my
concealer it's right here and it's not
the best cuz I just didn't want to do
too much because it's really hot but you
can see you can achieve a pretty natural
look or whatever I have a widow's peak
so I have to kind of push my hair right
here back a little bit or else my hair's
gonna go straight across which is not
attractive so yeah that's why I have to
kind of always push my hair in the front
a little bit away from my face and what
a for it to look correct cuz that good
Oh Eddie Oh
but yeah it's a natural brown color is
not black although it looks black let's
see ya on camera it's just it's black it
just looks black um this is what it look
like in the front it's right here um so
with a little more and again the still
top is a little darker most people have
a problem with it being too light but
mine's is a little darker than my skin
tone but I can always you know throw
concealer on top of that to kind of give
a seamless look I just didn't do it
today
um but yeah check out best lace wigs the
link will be in a below bar if you have
any questions and I will talk to y'all
later and I'll put the stock up pictures
of what the cat construction looks like
cuz it's a glueless cap um at the bottom
is well and somewhere in this video so
I'll talk to y'all later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
