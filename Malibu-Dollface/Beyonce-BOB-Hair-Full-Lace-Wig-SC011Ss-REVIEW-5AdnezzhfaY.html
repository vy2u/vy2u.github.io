take away your truth but the question is
they say I'm crazy okay guys I just want
to give it like a precursor before I
start this if y'all hear anything that
is my fan because I'm hiding under all
this leather and I've changed about a
good six times
so anyway I'm coming to review this girl
wig this wig is very different from what
I'm used to
it's from of course RPG show this is the
busted box
 but the way it came safe and sound
no problem I don't know where the paper
is for this week because I got a story
behind this this week and the reason why
I wanted it so I'll get to it but I
believe you should have seen it in the
beginning but if you didn't this is what
should be SC zero-one-one I asked him
for this week is because I thought that
this week was gonna be his light it's my
Beyonce wig my Beyonce Bob that I did I
think sometime last year or the year
before I don't recall
but I remember I had a wig I had on a
red jacket the picture should be
somewhere right here and I thought it
was going to be that color and I was
going to make it gray like I did all my
other wigs because I don't have a great
Bob I have hair from another company
that is um it's great but it's not a bob
you don't isn't it doesn't just do this
in the back it's just even all the way
around so it's kind of like a wrap
sounds like I want to keep it I don't
want to get rid of it and cut it into a
bob so I just wanted another one when I
got it this hair was not it the same
color as that one so I think because
it's not the same like number so maybe I
think things just got lost in
translation y'all and you know things
happen so when I got out look okay well
I'm going to try to make it darker I use
the same technique that I did on all
three of my other wigs and none of them
I mean none of it worked because this is
clearly not gray it's still this you
know dark blondish color
man on camera is still coming off like a
little greenish maybe because of the
color it didn't you know it wasn't it do
what I wanted it to do and I have two
bottles of platinum a door left and I
didn't want to use those some like what
if I do it on this and then I just waste
money because the bottles are not cheap
cause like I'm just going to leave it
like it is and kind of let it be what it
is for you guys you're looking like that
I look like The Bride of Chucky Loki
though hmm um but I actually like it if
you take this look and dress it up like
I should have put on a black shirt but I
also was not in the mood if you put on a
black jacket some black gloves to match
the jacket throw in some good old dark
glasses and you find somebody with a
motorcycle you can really make this work
you know so I mean it's not for the
everyday person unless this is your
color but for you know people like me on
all of my black hair so it's kind of
different or whatever but I do like this
and I'm probably going to darken the
color a lot I'm just a have another bob
because I have a brown Bob I have a
black one I have a red one I have a
green one that I never reviewed because
it was just for my personal collection
and then I have this one I just wanted
something a little different and I do
like it though it's cute I like the way
that they could I didn't cut nothing
everything that that it looks like it
came just like that it was big of course
if I had to lay it down but besides that
it was big but also make sure you guys
keep watching because I have a giveaway
with rpgs show coming up for one of my
wigs that you guys love oh so very much
um but yeah let me know how you like
this one if you like it if you don't
like it you want me to turn it down do
you want me to make a brighter is too
close to my skin complexion all ears it
was just really for fun I just wanted to
try something a little bit different and
yeah I like this I could be a rebel I
just gotta find somebody I got a car
with no top on it or somebody with a
nice Harley or something and we can
really make this work but it was
supposed to originally be gray and I it
was supposed to be based on this picture
that I've already done
Oh with gray hair but um yeah it's just
I don't know why the wig just wouldn't
take the color I why do you use a wrench
though and a wrench is usually
regulated for super like blond powder
white hair and or gray hair so I really
didn't take it took some but not as much
as I would have liked it and I'm sure if
I were to do that I adore platinum on it
then it should it would have made it
gray and I wanted it to be like a darker
gray because then that picture of my
hair is more of a I lighter but I do
like this so let me know what you guys
think
SC zero-one-one so yeah let me know it
parted great though look at that oh
that's what I'm talking about the dye
job is really good too it fades out like
it's supposed to it's not all like blunt
like time tamar's because hers be O but
anyway I'll catch out in the next one
and I'll talk to y'all later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
