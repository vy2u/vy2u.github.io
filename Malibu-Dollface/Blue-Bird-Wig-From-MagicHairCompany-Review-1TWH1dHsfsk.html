current wig my blue wig that I'm wearing
and this way it's from magic hair
company um
this alright I got its a story behind
this wig okay because I've had this week
for quite some time and I would like to
personally apologize to the owner of
magic hair company because I was
supposed to do this review right after I
got the wig but I couldn't figure out
what color I wanted it to be um how I
was gonna wear and how I was gonna style
it um how the color was gonna come out I
dare to do to call it twice because the
first time something just seemed like he
didn't want work I don't know um but
this was the end result of this color
when I first received what I would first
receive I went to the store here in LA
and I put all information if you are in
the LA California area I'll put all
information to the store below as well
as the website um I went in there and I
was like getting my reviews um you know
ready and she had this beautiful it was
gonna go for something different before
and she had this beautiful blonde wig
with these dark
it's sitting up there and it was all big
and I was like I want to try that like
I've had like curly hair and big hair
but I haven't like had a full wig that
was like that so when I got the wig it
was just like this it was just as big
but it was blond it was like bleached
blonde and oh wow I wonder what this
would look like because I was gonna wear
like that no like no I wonder what its
gonna look like so I pondered like
lavender what color do I wanna do and
then I thought like you know I did do
blue before and I really like blue
because they complimented my skin tone
very well but I wanted to try it in a
different texture just not straight or
you know waves I wanted to like have
some texture to it but the thing about
getting hair that has a lot of texture
to it if you start to put too much color
on it it will become just a big mosh pit
of wood so I was like I don't want to do
nothing too much because it'll be a lot
because I was thinking red but I was
like do something a little different so
I went back to what I know
I used the adore aquamarine used for
bottles of it and the reason why I do
use for bottles is because in some areas
it didn't uh it was my fault because I
try to do where I didn't get any of the
color on the lace so I'm trying to be a
little meticulous about it and I missed
some spots so I had to go back because
it was some green in some areas and I
don't want the hair to be green
um I got this idea and I wanted to do
this color because I think Elise's hair
but hers was green and blue
and I was gonna do both but I didn't
know how I was gonna come out and I was
a little scared that it was gonna be a
little ratchet so I was like I don't
think I want to do the green I think I'm
just leave it all blue so I use four
bottles of Occam or aquamarine from a
door and I let it sit I put it in the
arm ziplock back and I let it sit for
about four days
I want to believe when I give you guys
these these days that I like this hair
sit it's not because you have to do it
you can probably have it for a couple of
hours and you might still get the same
result but the thing about a door is the
longer you let it sit the more is gonna
deposit to the hair so it kind of turns
from a semi permanent to a permanent
hair color so I knew the longer that I
would let it sit the more blue it was
gonna be so I did the first round and it
wasn't the color that I wanted so then I
went back and I did it again and then I
let it sit um once I did that I rinsed
it out and I shampooed it with my
lavender shampoo that I used on my gray
hair because I'm like I don't want to
use any sulfate based shampoos that will
strip the color out because then that
just kind of wasted a couple of days so
I used that it didn't make the hair
purple at all which I'm happy about
because I don't want probably I don't
know like purple so I used this to
moisturize the hair when I was all said
and done and this stuff worked like a
charm um it's a deep conditioner and it
didn't smells good too
it didn't um strip the color at all it
is just way it interrupts the color at
all I actually helped keep the color in
as well as a couple of other products
that I use too but this was the main
product that kept the integrity of the
hair so it went back after I let it air
dry I put some I have the gray Lucchese
curl cream use this which is the Garnier
Fructis curl
yeah the calm down curl I've had this
for a long time I had this back when I
was wearing curly hair like on a regular
basis I've had this for a while and I
put this on the hair after
ital enjoyed it and I kind of let it air
dry and as I let it air dry it was
before I combed this out because it was
very like flatter than this
it was more kind of like hmm like this
and kind of in the back you can kind of
tell like right here it looks more like
this
so before I combed it out that's what it
looked like but I wanted this more big
untain but pretty look so I just took my
paddle brush and I just lightly went
through all of this not much in the back
because I still wanted you to see the
texture I'm gonna take it all out so you
guys cuz didn't see what it was just a
big Bush but yeah this is pretty much
what it looked like after I did that and
it's been good I had no shedding which
I'm surprised because usually curly hair
sheds like crazy but I have not gotten
no shedding with this it took the color
very very well there's no blonde pieces
left there is no hints of blood
everything is blue all the way around it
is blue I don't know the exact specs on
this wig because it was a display wig
but I will put all of the information
below of the length the texture and all
of that good stuff
um but yeah I really like these you guys
know I'm trying to get like I said in my
previous reviews I'm trying to get more
into the natural hair you know for those
who don't like to wear straight hair all
the time if you want to do the curly and
the color like everyone is doing this
would be a good alternative to have this
beautiful color you know but in a
natural state it's not this European
look you know that everybody is it into
which is cool so if you guys have any
questions for me please feel free to ask
me below remember this is from magic
hair company and this was a custom unit
oh yeah if you guys are trying to do
your color or you want some like
beautiful curly hair this is perfect
this is perfect because I see a lot of
people with this and it's not exactly
what I usually like but Kelis really
inspired me and I love me some Kelis so
this was perfect so maybe I'll do the
green and a different uni but maybe I'll
do to try the green curly that would be
cute or whatever but I'm really feeling
this nice aquamarine blueish color that
I got going on so yeah I'll talk to you
guys in the next one and I hoped you
like to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
