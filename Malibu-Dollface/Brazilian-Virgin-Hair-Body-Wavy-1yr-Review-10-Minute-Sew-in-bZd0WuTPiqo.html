look him out right there did you like I
like this so this is the hair strike now
you guys know originally it was a body
way so I straighten it out and I
attached a subways closure to the top as
you can see this is what the inside
looks like and it also has two tag that
let you know how many you can't really
see it right here but let you know how
many Ounces are in it um so I just got I
went ahead and sold it over like I did
once before and this is just me applying
it and putting it on initially I was
going to do the middle part again
because that's what I did when I first
received the unit however um after doing
it it was really really flat and
straight so I decided to go ahead and do
a side part and curl it so yeah this was
the final look and I liked it
okay guys so this is just going to be an
update video on my current hair that I'm
rocking um if you guys know sometimes I
want to say last year I think this is a
year update on my 10 minute sew-in and
you guys know what I did this I had a
little part initially when I did it so I
I was a rocking closure at that time so
I was wearing my rumor out but as you
guys know I have become a closure a
connoisseur so um now I took one of my
subways closures from closure store and
attached you to the top of it and went
ahead and did this look because I
thought it would be more versatile to do
so um so I'm taking less that I'm
currently rocking which are 23 25 and 27
that it was a body way when I first
received it so I looked like this but it
was much tighter um of a way when I put
it in so I took a body weight closure
I'm putting on but I just straightened
it and then crawled in myself and then I
used my curling iron to put these nice
curls in it just for something like very
simple because initially when I did it I
did
have a middle part so I wanted something
a little bit different but not overkill
this is 14 ounces of hair so this would
be equivalent to about six bundles five
or six bundles give or take the company
and how they do their bundle but it just
depends
this reminds me of my mink hair because
it's so fine but it's so full and has so
much life to it I wore this I wore this
little puppy out and I have now that I
moved everything I've decided to go on
head snatch it on out and see what's
what it's up to but see this is the
thing about good quality hair and last
you probably a lifetime if you take care
of it and I just use a regular any music
ceramic iron I use like a curling
curling iron and yeah it worked out so I
hope you guys enjoyed this and I hope
you guys I will look into Tim in the
sewing because they actually have very
good deals
it makes the it takes the headache out
of wig making also they have dropped
their prices too so there is is like
thirty and forty percent cheaper than it
was when I initially did my review a
year ago so this actually would be the
perfect time although I was getting high
I would definitely take full advantage
of the fact that they have this huge
discount going on right now versus with
their regular prices because I know for
a fact for me whenever I see a good good
sale I just go for it you know
especially if I'm looking for something
so you guys know how the caps are made
on these is a stretchable way cap and
then each track is put on the wig cap
this is like how a wig is made but it's
a bit different because it's not a dome
cap it's not like a stretchable panel
cap so when I first did it I actually
put it on and then I sold it down but
because I don't you know wear my hair to
sleep anymore
you know I'm saying oh I sew it down I
can take it off I just put it all in and
adjusted it with some bobby pins too
door but the closure actually made a
world of a difference in his hair
because now it's like a full wig I can
just throw on and I can go as opposed to
before when I had to make sure that my
Levi's was good because I remember what
I had it uh you don't put the picture
right there
when I had it I had my hair out from the
top and it was hot as you can see in the
picture it was really hot that day my
hair was starting to poof up and kind of
sweat out which I hate so yeah a closure
is the way to go plus it definitely
hopes contain your hair so my closure is
Pro Photo Store and this is my 10
minutes silly in it so if you guys are
interested make sure you guys check the
