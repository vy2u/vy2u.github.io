okay sure um today I want to do with you
for this nice layered bouncy hair that I
have which I love being like you guys
know I live for subways closure and you
never guess where this hair is actually
from this hair is from while African
they you guys know when I did the Aliya
one-in-a-million hair not the Suki one
not the not the light yeah q1 when I had
like the Suki one with the crop the
white crop top one that was from well
African and then Aidan said we have left
two hair and I was like I really know if
I want to do a review for what - hair
from a wig company you know not really I
don't know but I did get a chance that
I'm happy idea because um actually
really liked his hair it's really pretty
um they sent me four bundles of I see
they send me four bundles of 22-inch and
then I took this is how long the hair is
I took it in and I um I layered it and
then I put some I put I wasn't learning
and I turned it a little bit so like 20
it looks longer because of the layers
though it looks way longer than what it
actually is
so yeah it's a Brazilian Indian here so
it also has a silk base closure so the
circle base closure is actually
I'm Brazilian here as well to think that
I do like about this here any things
that I don't like about it the things
that I do like about it um or the fact
that it's flowy
sometimes when I get here it is flowy
but it's after I've done all this
maintenance to it probably to make it
look like this the cutting it was so
easy and free-flowing is what I love you
know I love to have hair where I can cut
into it like this and curl in and do
this I don't really wear my hair like
this
as far as clearly with the decide part
of the time but I'm talking about as far
as the arm the layers go because a lot
of times when the layers like the curls
drop um the layers end up just looking
choppy or even if they're cut very very
well so that's kind of why I don't wear
my hair like this often but I do want
something a little bit different um
opposed to like the straight or the big
waves that I do you know jazzy because
my hair is usually black so my
hairstyles tends to start to look the
same after a while um and that's why I'm
braid my other hair and I might throw a
little bit of color in this but don't
quote me because I might not I'm not
really sure but when I received the hair
they all came in these packages like
this with a gold um like thingy on it to
keep them close or whatever um it says
by the number is wb-300 silky straight
hair color natural is 22 is this a
natural hair color but it looks really
black to me on camera it looks like
really really black
so yeah it's still pretty though I love
black hair period it's just it looks
better on me at least um ya see it curls
beca when you comb through it and this
is what hair is supposed to do it was to
comb it supposed to bounce and behave
and when you come to it it's not
supposed to get any snags or whatever
the situation is now I know one video I
did I forgot which review was but
somebody said usually you run your hands
your fingers through your hair but you
keep stopping at a certain point in the
video and
have my hair curl that's because you
don't want to disturb your curls I don't
want to keep running my hair through
this because then before I know all my
curls are going to be missing that's a
bit that's that's a problem but yeah you
see it's really pretty and after I do
all this i'ma show you I could do all
this and then I take the paddle brush
and I run it through it's going to go
right back to what it was now let you do
that with some pack hair you see how
many cymatics you actually get so
everything went right back to what it
was
see love this so yeah this is some
really good virgin hair um it doesn't
you know sometimes I don't know if you
guys know but sometimes when you buy a
virgin hair virgin hair and um I don't
know if you guys know but a lot of times
with companies when I receive hair if I
would reach to do a review for the
company and I received the hair and the
hair has like a very odd smell to it
I'll send the hair back and I won't
review it because that lets me know
right now that it's it's not virgin hair
and it's not virgin hair and you're
saying that you want me to say is virgin
hair then that's a problem so I will not
review it so if you see me not review
for certain companies and stuff like
that is for good reason because they're
not there the quality of their hair what
they're selling is not what they're
really selling this hair for a fact is
virgin and the reason I usually do a
strand test when I get um when I get our
virgin hair because um if you take
virgin hair and put some bleach on it
usually if you leave the bleach like on
the entire hair the whole entire time
and like let it for like hours if it
turns pure white is virgin if it turns
green orange or any color but white is
something else that's in the hair and
you know when I was in beauty school we
learnt that if the hair is not virgin
you have to figure out what they had on
it before because you don't know what it
is that's why when some people died
their hair like their their bundles they
end up coming out that oranjee brassy
color and sometime judges over
processing bleach with leach but for the
most part is it's because of that reason
is because it's something else on the
hair
does not belong on here and shouldn't be
on there so yeah but this for sure is
virgin hair because it smells fresh if
smell is like it doesn't have a residue
on it it doesn't have like a um a film
on it which sometimes Oh I've since you
guys don't know how much hair I send
back and just refused to do a review for
companies if you do you I'm I'm not
about a quick bug and I'm not about a
free some just free hair to just say
whatever you know but yeah it's really
nice
I like this it holds a curl very well
believe it or not these same like Wayne
pearls I've been here for the past four
days I have not I promised you have not
recur old nothing that's why it's so
loose but when I went to get my computer
the other day I just have my hair like
in a bun so whenever you crave hair if
you don't want to like heat from there
you can put in a bun and if you put in a
nice Shinyoung bun it will um it will
keep the the crow pattern in right here
it's a little bump because of how I
slept on it but besides that but I just
wanted to come to you guys not with a
French head but kind of just I mean I
did put something on my edges though but
yeah this is a silk base closure I love
this closure it's not my favorite and
the only reason why it's not my favorite
versus the other company that I reviews
and I really like is because of the
simple fact that the the directional the
way that they put the there was no light
okay when you put hair on a weft or a
closure it's if it's free-flowing it
should go everywhere sometimes you get
closure that they all go back and this
one all went to the side so it was it
was a little fight to get it to lay but
it wasn't horrible you know if they
wasn't like some other stuff that I've
had so it wasn't a nightmare or whatever
um but it wasn't it's free-flowing and
easy lane as I would have liked and that
comes with it I was just like but it
wasn't bad at all it was just Morse it
wasn't just to my liking um but I liked
how it turned out so I'm good on that
one so yeah if you have any questions
about this particular hair then let me
know this hair again is from WoW African
and um yeah I will talk to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
