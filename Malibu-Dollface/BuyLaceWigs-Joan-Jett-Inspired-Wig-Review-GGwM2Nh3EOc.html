look is very different from what I am
very much used to I'm giving you rocker
chick a la Joan Jett is what I was my
point here was so because it is October
I was like I'm gonna do like probably
three or four serious videos where I
kind of become these different
characters and this feels very very very
rush
um you know Joan Jett I got familiar
with her because she was definitely
before my time but she did a movie about
her life and about the college Bella
Swan but Kristen Stewart played her and
every time I see Kristen Stewart
especially when she was doing comic-con
her hair was definitely like a lot like
you know they cut it into this
old-school rocker Bob bye
so when I went ahead and started picking
the wig from by Leslie they're like
really interested in and I knew
Halloween was coming this was something
that I wanted to try and it be honest
with you I really liked it it still
gives me a tease vibes for sure because
the way it's cut I remember in the 80s
everybody had their hair cut very
bluntly with a lot of layers some of
them have bangs some of them didn't
so this particular hair is only 14
inches so 14 is alright that's yeah okay
so that's what when people are on my
hair to be 16 I'll be like that's it
like that's okay I mean my bangies
usually about 22 so this is very
different from me for me the original
picture which I would put here of the
girl that I picked it doesn't look like
this at all and if I swoop my bang like
hers I don't stride it it still doesn't
look like her picture at all
so I know people say maybe another
reference photo could see the problem is
a lot of times when you order wigs off
of websites they'll use a celebrity as
an example and they'll cut the wig and
make the way to this with
specifications of what the celebrity had
the problem is it doesn't always look
like the celebrity's hair I don't even
know the young lady in the picture
however this this didn't look like her
hair to me at all if I go ahead and comb
this out then you will see that it has a
lot of shine to it it has a lot of
luster to it and whoever cut this did a
really good job I will say they did a
phenomenal job with those good ol shears
but the problem is this hair can't be
worn in any other style besides the
style that I currently have right now
it's kind of giving me a viral a little
bit too so you know is it's definitely
giving me a t chic um and that's all
when hit him come on barbie and the
rockers shirt on because i feel like it
was fitting with this good old old
faithful that ejecta that i got from
forever 21 like ages ago and then the
lips that I'm wearing are witches by Kat
Von D which is the liquid matte lipstick
so my cap size you guys always know I
wear a small and the hair is 100% Indian
hair which I could tell because it's
very fine and it has a lot of movement
to it I don't know if this must be
something that you would want to wear on
a regular day I'm not sure how I would
style this on a regular day without all
the getup that I have on I don't know
how this would look let's see cuz I
claim this out before to see how it was
gonna look and it says that it is a bob
okay it's crooked I said that yeah then
it's a bob but I don't know how I don't
know oh okay I would say this I was
seeing some girls with the hair like
this I have never liked it but I have um
the wig itself is very well made it is a
lace front leg so as you seen how it
looked in the beginning of this video on
the cat construction so it's it's pretty
much like any other wig that I've ever
gotten from buy lace wig it's not really
a big difference so I'm pretty much used
today but it's cute it definitely gives
me rocker chic you know look I put
my mama had her hair like this and hey I
mean in the nineties I feel like this
you know everybody weren't a natural
hair this is what gives me um I can
definitely walk Yonge Street and get
away with this so I just kind of cut
your hair my real hair would look like
this if I got really really really hard
pressed and it probably would only look
like this for that day after that after
I wrapped it it would go right back to
being what it was um but I feel like
they did a good job I don't think they
did a good job mimicking the photo but
it definitely worked it on and I'm
always when I especially when I do wigs
and I always tell you guys is when you
get the wigs make sure you try to make
them your own because sometimes you're
not gonna come out in the way in which
you envision them 90% of time they don't
um so you have to pretty much work
around it and try to make it work but I
feel like I could go on tour like Pat
Benatar something like yeah right now
I'll hit it with the Beatles black side
something you know and and blend right
in cuz it's kind of gives me again
80s rocker chic like I could go do a lot
of cocaine with this hair and I don't
think that nobody would think twice oh
it doesn't at all and I don't know
it because it's the length usually of
course the longer the hair some like
this shit's a lot more it shouldn't be
shedding if this short um because I'm
not pulling at it or anything like that
so it doesn't he doesn't share the the
luster that's in the hair is very
natural I didn't put nothing in it
personally and yeah I like this I don't
know if I would wear this again out
anywhere but I do like it and I like the
way that it flows and it moves and
invited like a set of like a whole bunch
of rock songs when I was finished it
would look like this
very judges so if you guys are
interested in this hair from by last
week's make sure you guys check the link
below remember it's only the MS
beginning the very beginning of October
so if you haven't got your Halloween
costumes together you're looking for
some really good wigs that you could
probably wear for Halloween and in all
you know I ain't no regular today I
would definitely check them out cuz I
don't think I've ever had a bad
experience with dirt week there shipping
is always people people always ask me
about shipment the shipment for me it's
always very quickly I usually get the
hair
in the week so we discuss it on Monday
and they ship it out Tuesday I usually
get it by Thursday or Friday so usually
it's like a seven-day waiting period
give or take depending on when you order
so yeah have a look at the site and if
you guys are going to be Joan Jett or
anybody from the 80s I would definitely
consider this one and remember if you
guys order and there's a comment box
when you order if you put I love Malibu
Dollface you will get a surprise gift so
and this is for anyway not just this one
but anyway from my lips
that will work so you should put coke
that's here at the bottom and I'll
cheese guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
