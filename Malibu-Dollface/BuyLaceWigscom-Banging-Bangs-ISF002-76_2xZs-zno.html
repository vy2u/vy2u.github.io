you guys can see I have bangs now for
the first time ever on my channel but
anyway um this week is from buy lace
wigs as you couldn't see and it came
with just it says quality control to
prove these kind of my other ones too
but I don't really realize it till now
and then it came with this you know the
little thing that goes in alright so
let's get to this picture this week this
is what the stock feature looks like of
the wig and this is their 24 inch jib
like straight for lace bangs the SKU
number is is f00 to the hair length is
24 inches the hair color is a1 the cap
circumference is a medium so it's a 20
that's why this feels so loose it's a
medium so it's a 21 and 21.5 yeah my cap
toe is a little too loose for me the
lace colors are like light brown the
hair density is between 110 and 130 and
it's no sub top so the begin of this
video you guys should have seen actually
the width the width looks like when it's
not Owen versus what it looks like now
you guys know usually my part is on this
side so my bangs go this way so we're
trying something a little new these are
still bangs so if I wanted to this could
go like this but it's not gonna do that
because of the way I Flatiron my hair
but anyway um so this is one of the
reasons why I don't like to wear bangs
is because they are very annoying and as
you can see they don't want to stay in
the right direction they don't want to
do what I wanted to do and this all kind
of comes from the fact that this unit is
not full at all this is how full this
side is and this is how full this idea
is so as you can see it's not a lot of
hair so when I went ahead and cut these
bangs because they were
this is I've heard a lot of other
youtubers kind of complain about this
when they have they get their bangs and
stuff like this they're not cut like
they should be in order to fit the
person's face and you can't like cut the
bangs like all the way because you don't
know who's gonna get it so it might not
fit somebody's face or the head so I get
that but they are they came all the way
down here okay and I had to cut them to
where they are right now and I still
don't like them but I don't want to cut
them anymore cuz if I cut them anymore
they might end up like my other wig that
I had to make into a bob because I kind
of killed it bangs are definitely not my
specialty because they're really
annoying to me but if I cut this a
little bit more then you can see where I
was going with this look um but yeah the
hair texture is nice it's soft its silky
um but yeah it's got to be another way
to fix the bangs okay it's got to be
another way because date-like work it's
cut all the way to here if it was just
cut to here I would have been fine but
they cut it all the way out here they
pre-cut it all the way out here so then
it some people like their bangs a little
bit wider than others I don't I like
them to stop right here
the nick even Barbie bangs okay you know
how Barbie's bangs are just right in
front end in their dirt all the hair on
the side just flows down that's what I
like I don't like them to be this damn
long because then you can't see anything
and I think people on Instagram and some
youtubers for where their bangs like
that and that's nice and cool but it's
just not really for me
so um out of ten I would give the wig
quality a nice nine the style a1 and
overall I would just give this a
probably a nice little three cuz it's
just not what I thought it was gonna be
which kind of sucks because I really did
want this way to be cute but yeah I feel
like an old lady with these bangs I feel
like a nanny you know like it just
doesn't really work with me like if I go
when I brush when I call them like this
they don't look so bad
the problem is I can't see any well i
can see but not very i wouldn't drive
with these let's just say that okay
really wouldn't drive with these but um
yeah so um usually when I have wigs I
think the last review I did for my lace
wigs it was for my platinum blonde hair
which I like I just wanted some more
intensity to it or whatever but overall
it was a nice week and again this one is
a nice week to it don't come window
adjustable straps and don't come with
any combs which under kind of annoys me
too because y'all know my cap is the
wrong size is a medium cap so it doesn't
fit me like I want to so it out this hat
yeah this probably would just fly and
slip all over my entire head
unfortunately so next time I get away
from them I'm gonna make sure that they
know that I wear a small not a medium
cap because it starts getting backing
and all of that good mess in the back so
yeah um kind of disappointing with this
wig don't hate it just don't love it you
know so I'll put the information to this
wig below and if you guys do order this
let me know this is the density of this
week is between 110 and 130 but I don't
know again everybody's jet black Black's
density it all varies from company a
company some company say they do their
stock wigs or 100% it ended like 150
density then you go to another site and
they say they stock wigs are 150 or
they're like a hundred percent density
so it just depends on the company but
yeah I'm gonna slide on the bangs and
kind of stick to what I know and I think
I might actually try this again we're
probably with some weft in here in the
closure because that way I can control
the density and I can control the the
bangs and where they start and how
they're cut versus someone else's yeah
so I'll talk to y'all in the next one I
know y'all gonna be like oh no oh no no
so go ahead and put your opinions below
why not and I'll catch y'all in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
