to put me on a leash it better be
diamond studded or you can kiss me
I was always crazy isn't before the
drugs okay so I know you're like really
okay so Alex I'm gonna explain this look
in just a second but can we get into how
late my blonde hair is right now hello
like when you clean okay so from the
title you guys should know that this
look was um inspired from the very
controversial miss Donatella Versace
um and I am wearing leggings to all of
this stuff that I'm wearing is from the
Versace H&amp;amp;M collection so I really was
like I really wanna you know I own all
of this stuff and later on tonight I'm
actually doing a performance with one of
my friends um and Avalon I think is like
none I think we go I think it's like
nine I think I have to be there like
tenors I'm like that I remember but I'm
not performing and I'm gonna wear this
because it's very whimsical for what
we're doing but I own all of this
Versace stuff and I have never wore it
I wore it um when I did a review for um
some hair but not I didn't wear the belt
with the two so I just decided to put
everything together and then his wig was
just perfect for this situation so why
not this week is from buy lace wigs and
you guys know this is by my third I
think my third time working with them um
and this wig is a number 613 if you want
to wear like what tone a blonde this is
this is a six 13 so this is the Versace
blonde this is the Barbie blonde well
the old school Barbie blonde Barbie here
got a little more of a yellow tint to it
now but it's not like this um so it's 20
it's our virgin remy Chinese hair and it
is 28 inches long and it's not that full
it's not which I like for this sleek
look is not SuperDuper full but this is
a bangin wig I will say I would
could y'all know I don't do the blonde
at all but because it was Donatella and
it was Versace and every time you see
anything Versace related if you look at
I'll put it here Lady Gaga's ads for
Versace her hair was like this all the
models for this particular campaign has
his hair except for the model who wore
this outfit the model wear this outfit
she had a dark lip like this and then
she our eyes were very dramatic but her
her wig was short and I guess so you can
see the detail that's in this jacket so
I think that was what they were going
for whatever but um I just wanted to go
for more of this Versace
classic look with this this and all of
this and it's actually dope so I know a
lot of you guys are wondering did you
really bleach your hair in the front so
we come at you know I didn't what I did
was as you can see right here my hair is
still dark but from a distance it looked
like my hair is just bleached and it's
blond so what I did was I took my
Anasazi a Beverly Hills a contour kit
this is though um this is not the cream
one this is the powder one and I use
this color which is banana and this
color which is I don't remember things
like fawn I think so I remember but
whatever I use that and I just took this
brush and then I put it on my hairline
where my hair usually is like when I put
my part for my darker wigs I did the
same thing so from a distance it looks
like my hair is bleached um but it's not
as you can see my everything's still
they're not doing that down from the wig
um but I've had this week for about two
weeks and I did a photo shoot in it
because I got some stuff coming up for
my birthday so I use this wig for some
Barbie stuff and then I wore this wig
around the house cuz I listen I don't
you know I don't I would never go
outside like this you know but for those
I understand that there are other people
who watch my videos who are not people
who are wear a lot of dark hair there
were a lot of light here too so they
have wigs for the lighter complexions as
well or the true blondes out there I'm
not a true blonde by a longshot however
I do like the contrast between my skin
color and the hair and it's not this
orange II blonde is actually like true
blonde
like blonde blonde so that's the thing
that I liked I think they're most about
this week
it hasn't given me any problems it
doesn't it straightens very easily right
here
I just didn't fly down like I was
supposed to so that was my phone um but
as you can see on this side is what it
would you look like if I would have done
so um it does not get tangled it does
not shed because I would all be mad
because the wigs not that full to start
off with so if it was shedding I would
have something like an issue with this
but this is a great wig if you're going
for that Barbie look and you don't want
to get like a so in the only thing that
I did when I got it um was I parted it
down the middle and then I did my light
my regular laying technique and I didn't
put anything in the roots this darkness
that you're seeing in the roots is
natural it's just because what's
underneath which is my wig cap which
came with it which is this one it's the
lighter one um they put this one in
there so I guess from a distance in the
contrast it still gives me a part which
would that's what natural blonde hair
does whenever you see somebody even when
they have bleached blonde hair it still
you can still see a little darkness
right here which i think is great and it
just looks like I got a fresh bleach job
and bleached to my edges on to hell but
yeah it doesn't get tangled and
straightens very easily I did press the
roots because you guys know that so what
I'll do when I want to lay my wigs and I
thought you got to be careful with
blonde hair if you put too much heat on
it it will start to turn yellow and I'm
like you know I'll pump it up the value
up when I do my dark hair but I had to
be careful with this hair not to burn
and or singe anything up here because if
I were to dip that it would've looked
crazy and you just melt there's no way I
can fix that like if you ever burned
dark hair you can go back in with like
some color and kind of just patch it up
but with this I can there's nothing that
I can do it would just be burnt um so
yeah it's pretty long as you can see and
it's giving me very it's giving me
Donatella for real like it's just blonde
but this actually works as I use it for
something else as a side part it looks
great for what it's supposed to be again
I am NOT a natural blonde I wear dark
hair all the time or colorful hair
I don't wear like
hair like that on a regular basis but
for this moment it was necessary and I
shouldn't really like it I like it so I
know that 613 for me it works any other
blonde it just comes off it comes off
wrong and I honestly was going to make
this hair pink when I received it I was
like I'm just gonna you know doesn't
pink on it and make it a nice pretty
pink wig so I probably like the color
Barbies dress back there I was gonna
make it that color but I really was like
I don't have like a Barbie pink wig and
the one that I did have I ended up
making it great which was um when I had
the great things so yeah um this is from
buy lace wigs um this is 20 again I'm
get y'all expect real quick cuz I don't
want y'all to forget what I have been
talking about so the hair length on this
is 28 inches
um the hair color it's a white blonde so
it's a 613 um my lace color is a light
brown I always get like light brown lace
because medium brown sometimes comes off
a little too dark and my scalp is really
light so light brown is the closest that
I'm gonna get even though I still do use
concealer um the capsizes and the
average slash petite so that it would be
the smallest although I will say this
one is a little smaller well it fits
right but if I put it right on my
hairline it's gonna not gonna hit the
back of my neighbor like I will like it
too so yeah for this one it seems like
it's a little bit smaller than my other
ones usually are but it still fit um the
hair type again is the Chinese virgin
remy hair and um it comes with combs in
it has two combs on the side one in the
back and I don't think there's an
adjustable strap right back here no
there's no adjustable strap it's just
lace back there so I just cut the lace
the lace is actually still on from here
around I didn't cut it all I just cut
this section off um but yeah this is
kind of like storm like I always love
when I see like a lot of models that
have that are very like really dark like
the color of my lips tart or like this
dark but they have blonde hair is the
contrast is just beautiful so I'm not
that color however I did my best people
I did my best but um let me know what
you guys like I know some of you guys
like I wanna get I know it's not
permanent but for the moment and
you guys should the photo on here should
really get where I was going with this
um but again this wig is for my lace
wigs and make sure you guys check them
out there is going to be a link to the
wig below make sure you guys rate
