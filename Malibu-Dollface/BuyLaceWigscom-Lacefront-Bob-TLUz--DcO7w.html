never out all right guys
so this is very different for me I'm not
like really no uh let's just talk shall
we
so this way is from my lace wigs and
this particular way I really like I will
say that I like it I just don't love it
and the reason why I don't love it is
because I thought it was gonna be
someone else
not this so yeah we gets back
I got like bangs don't get me wrong I
really do but I okay so they usually
want to review for what any company they
always give me options like they always
give me options and I usually ask me you
know like what do you want
you know what was what you feel in the
day and I'm saying with something that
you haven't done that you want to try
something like that and it was like
three different options and this was one
of the options the problem was the
option that I picked was this wig was
this Naomi Campbell get down I don't
look like okay so that kind of know the
color I thought was going to be the same
as her color and it's not this is
definitely a 1b this is definitely
nobody's Brown um and it's 14 inches
it's a 1b as a small cap um the lace is
so blue this lace front cap a it is 100%
Indian roomy hair it's an O so top and
it is a nice color or light brown okay
so I'm gonna keep the picture because I
want y'all to like understand me right
now
I'm thinking at this one because I can't
see that in the picture I can't see the
ends of her hair but I did google the
picture
where they got it as a reference you
can't see the ends of her hair but I'm
like okay this is gonna kind of come and
be something a little bit different but
it's gonna be a little know you know a
little fun and it is fun I'm just not
feeling the whole Pulp Fiction uma
Thurman get down that's what I'm not
this is like Kylie Jenner wore a wig
recently like this her and Tiger I don't
know before they broke up or got mad at
each other or whatever they had went out
and she had a wig on like this and I
hated it and I don't like this week as
much as I want to like it's and when I
do when I say I like it I like it as
well constructed there is no shedding
and it is very nice but it's just
annoyed it's not my steez though um it's
just not really me for some of y'all
this is perfect but I'm not a fan of the
bump ends and when I got it it was just
like this and I didn't want to go ahead
and like it's just not what I thought it
was gonna be it definitely turned into
something a little bit different but for
some of y'all this won't actually work
for you for me it's just a little too
old ladyish you know it's definitely
giving me a 50s glamour um and it will
work for something as far as like a
photoshoot or something and I'm trying
to go a place with this but no not my
steez not like this at all but again it
is a nice wig just not a fan of it so
I'll put the information for this
definitely below and hopefully the next
wig I get is something a little bit
different um makeup the bangs were a
little bit thicker or what really liked
it cuz this ain't working either you
know so I don't know y'all but I'll put
the information for this below and if
you're in this does I mean if I
straighten the bottom it'll be cute it's
still not what
you know and I left it like this because
I wanted y'all to see how it was because
I don't know how my own means harrion's
I just know she always wear bangles
because her edges are non-existent but
you know I don't know I don't think no
people I am lost for words um and I've
been trying to style this for about a
good week and it just haven't really
been working out for me so let me know
what you guys think you guys think it's
cute let me give you guys a why Chuck so
you want to be focused right on these
damn bangs let's see if y'all really
like this okay gap no let me know yes I
know yes all right let me know I'll
catch y'all in the next xx1
