of the cap to show you what were the
combs and stuff for it was a little
quick but yeah I'll go over the comb
placement and the cap construction and
all that later on in the video and here
I'm just gonna you can't see it because
I'm like face away from the camera but
I'm pretty much pulling some hair out in
the front and positioning the wig right
where my excuse me where my braids
stopped so that way I can put it on
properly and you know be cute and all
that stuff and it still look natural I
just pretty much took my hands and ran
it through all of those defined curls to
give it more of this naturally I just
took out my braids you know natural wave
pattern curls situation and vibe
Redeemers was it it wasn't a lot that I
had to do to it because it's like again
like I'll say in a review it's very
free-flowing and easy to do I just put
some edge control you guys know I love
this took elements straight edges
imesh control a small brush I used a
dark eyeliner to put like around cuz you
can still see my lace a little bit and
my lace is like brown so I wanted to
disguise that so that you couldn't see
it what I happen to cut all the lace off
so yeah that was pretty much it
okay guys so let me just say this as we
start off it's very rare that I actually
get excited about hair like really
excited like I am right now because I
have so much of it and I wear so much of
it it's like it's nice you know but I
need something that's different that's
new that's fabulous and this my dears is
it this wig is so versatile and so
freakin nice but so natural it's not
even funny I'm mad that this edge
control got me looking like I'm an edge
control killer in the front but it's not
that's not the case uh it just looked
like that cuz it's damn light but let's
get back to this hair like I could wear
it anyway and it still looks nice you
can pretty much do anything that you
want with this wig um because it's so
free-flowing and it's so natural and so
do what you want you know do what you
want this hair is from buy lace wigs but
this is about that life okay um so I
want to say when I seen the pictures for
this particular wig I wasn't like oh my
god is so beautiful I'm like okay it
looks nice well I could see what I can
do with it I'll see how it turns out or
whatever the only thing that I honestly
did to this entire wig was I took my
fingers and ran through it so this is
the picture of the young lady well this
is the picture of it when I received it
but this is what hers look like this is
what mine looks like
and I like mines better because although
it's the same wig it just looks more
natural and it has this natural feel to
it which I absolutely am obsessed with
it came with some earrings or is a
brooch but anyway it came with some free
stuff and then it also came with these
extra clips if I wanted to put like more
clips in places if I were
here so late and there's no cooks in the
area I can pretty much use those um this
wig is very flowy and it's very like
light it has like almost no weight on it
it's very very very very very very light
but I do love this like this is I've
gotten excited like I don't want to take
it off and a good thing about wigs that
I always tell people is that you can
always take them off like when you get
your hair sold in it's a convenience
because it's always in but the
inconvenience is you got to make sure
that you ain't sweating out your hair in
a shower you have to make sure that
you're wrapping it every night you have
to make sure that it's not getting wet
when you go out you have to make sure
that you're not killing your curl
pattern by too putting too much heat in
it but with wigs you could just take
them off take them off put them on a
dresser it'll stay just like this you
pick it up you put it on and you go
about your business okay as far as
shading goes and snags I do catch some
every now and then but because of hair I
can't do this it's not exactly like shed
free but none of I've never had curly
hair didn't shed like that's just the
thing like I don't know what else to
tell you like people our my curly haired
on I'm like if I don't shed now but
when I first got it it was you mm-hmm so
yeah um I'll put all the information
because they didn't send me a card which
I kind of hate it's like I don't have
any like information about the wig on
hands
I kinda know it this wig is a full lace
natural curly Brazilian for lace black
wig is 24 inches the product cold is I
don't know if that's I I or L but either
is s 0 for 1 or L SF 0 for 1 whichever
one works when you type it in it should
be the girl in the picture I showed
y'all it should be heard um hair color
is a 1b the lace color is the light
brown and my cap size is a petite my
hair density is between 110 and 130 this
is no silk top the hair type is
a brazilian virgin remy hair
there's no adjustable straps which I
kind of hate about that because this wig
is so free-flowing I would want a little
extra security in the back but I don't I
got some clothes back there which help
you know cuz i got my braids but i would
prefer if i had like you know adjustable
strap back there just just for a little
bit just calms there are three combs
there's one right here is one right here
and then there's one oh it's one right
here it's one right here and then
there's the one in the back and they
gave me two extra ones where I could put
one on the side and then one right here
it's lydendor second
I'll put extra combs in this if i know i
got to go to the club and get two just
swinging i would do that so yeah i will
be definitely coming back with this one
i want to be wearing this i want to go
to in and out and rock my wig but uh
I'll be back you guys will be seeing
this wig in some more videos and I do
have a lot of updates that I have to do
now cuz it's been about three or four
weeks first it's been about five weeks
so for some of the hair that I've worked
on that's hard
okay so yeah i will catch y'all in the
next one and I hope y'all enjoyed this
