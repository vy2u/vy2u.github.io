puppy care and so we're gonna talk about
it
shall we talk about the pink hey talk
about the pink of stubby okay so this
hair it's from by is there lace wig
okay so I'm gonna start this video by
saying that y'all I am like a week tired
I shot a music video for the last
probably three to four days for huge
artists and I cannot wait for y'all to
see it um actually work with model Sean
Ross
so can't wait for y'all to see it don't
get used to the nails it was something
cuz I had a photo shoot today because my
birthday is on the 10th and I did this
look ok so I'm going to point it out for
somebody else do my lace is still on
here people because my engines or black
so um I shot because it will be of
course edit out you can't see it um but
I left it on because I want it looks
like I bleached my roots hello I did not
and this is my peak here from by lace
wigs so to the hair itself and of the
frontal I'm currently rocking four
bundles of Brazilian straight up nice
and pink this hair came pre lightened
and pre color like this so I did not
have to do anything to this hair but put
it in again like I said you guys I left
my lace on only because I was shooting
this and I wanted to look like I had my
pink hair coming from the roots you can
do this by cutting your lace around just
here and using a little bit of color um
on your
Edge's if you do not want to bleach them
or you can do the invisible hairline
method which doesn't require glue so you
ain't reversing that don't do that um
because I'm not a person that's going to
wear my hair like this on a regular I
just feel like it was necessary for me
to just go ahead and bust one of these
you know so from a distance it looks
like I have photo it looks like I have
this nice beautiful pink hair coming
straight up out my scalp and my scalp is
come in a little dark here
um so once my pictures and everything
are editing for my birthday then you
guys will see what I'm talking about
so to these bundles I have had zero
shedding from this hair so far I've had
his hair for a matter of months at this
particular point and originally I was
going to I know they were going to send
me some more cuz you guys know I
reviewed 6:13 way from them and I
reviewed the 6:13 hair from them however
when I told him that I wanted to do pink
I thought they were thinking like okay
what I was going to do which was going
to take this hot pink color that I used
actually on one of my other wigs and I
was going to take the color and I my
6:13 that hot pink color not when he
came he kept saying we're gonna send the
pink hair so I'm like okay so when I got
the hair it was already pink and this
wasn't the think that I was going for
but lord knows this is the pink that I
love this works so well on my skin tone
hits my lips this is a jorah cosmetics
and I really do like this shade of pink
and I really do like the frontal the
front was really good so we gonna go
ahead and pull this up to the other and
see what's really going on up under here
I opted to do a side part only because
if I would I did a middle part it would
have been so much hair in my face which
were the convertible um oh but this kind
of gives a little more flexibility to it
versus me having just a dead set middle
part so this is a full frontal so if you
actually got this hair and went ahead
and put I have an elastic band in mind
but if you went ahead and cut it
correctly like all the way around like
because my edges kind of dart out right
here then it's really hard a lot of
times for me to get front tools that fit
my hairline
so and then because my hair light is low
plus I got a little peak as you can see
here but from a distance you can't see
and if I were to put some some light
powder on my hairline it really would
have been not visible and I just took a
little bit of my concealer and I put it
on my leg so that my lace because it was
trendy whoa it was a light brown so it's
too light so I just put it on here so
you really couldn't see it but if you
did this and actually cut it where it's
about like a half of an inch all the way
around you can actually get away with
this if nobody was up in your face so my
front shal I believe is 24 inches as
well and if it's not now I believe it is
24 is just a little bit shorter because
it's felt starts at the top but all of
this is my front tool and then all of my
tracks of course are in the back so if I
was to take my hair and kind of do this
let's just say this part was in here
then it would look I'll be able to
pretty much do this and you won't be
able to tell so it goes from ear to ear
on each side so this side will come up
like such like this and it falls like
this so it does have a very very natural
feel to it I will say that um the luster
of this hair because it is pink
sometimes when I see pink hair and every
human hair but if you pink is sometimes
look synthetic because it's so shiny
down whatever belt but this hair does
not it has a very natural luster as you
would get from 613 or any like honey
blonde anything that is of a lighter
color the hue of this luster is actually
very very realistic it's not crazy um
shiny but it's actually not dull as if
my head was processed over the limit and
now my hair is just drying punchy these
are definitely not true to lint I think
the hair is actually longer than what
they're saying it says it is 24 but I
measured it and it's coming in somewhere
between like 25 and some change so I'm
thinking more of a 26 more so than a 24
which is always good because I'll rather
have more hair than not enough
good out if you wanted to take this
color and add more color to it like for
instance I was thinking about because I
had that hot pink I was going to make my
dark roots pink like a dark pink and
then it was going to go into our life
being sort of been like this much dark
pink and then it would've went out into
this lighting but I just didn't want to
touch this beautiful but they did a
really good job and this hair is like
very even but look how pretty this is
it's very even and it feels amazing and
like again if I stand right here it
looks like I bleached my entire head to
get my weave to match boom I love this
I'm obsessed with this and I actually
want to wear this and a half up half
down and I just haven't did it because
I'm trying to find a powder that's
around this color or eyeshadow that
somewhat discolor so if y'all only
eyeshadows as a Ronis color and
somebody's pellets please put it below
because I was so appreciated um and I
know you guys are asking what is a
powder for is it's for my hairline
I need this to blend I need all this
extra hair I got right here to be white
you guys remember I'll put it here I had
did and I think it actually was for my
lace wigs I did my recite she hair and I
had a middle part with that and in this
video and in the photos it looks as if I
bleached my roots but I didn't I just
use another I use FC my Anastasio banana
powder for the top of my hair just to do
something a little bit different and do
something I look like a Nicki Minaj
right now I'm like who do I look like
especially with this filling myself and
I'm feeling very nagesh but that's what
I did with that and I want to do the
same thing with this so if you guys know
any powders yeah let me know but buy
lace wigs I get an a-plus-plus on top of
the plus for me because and then up
before I even give them their final
grade this hair when I washed it it did
not not co wash okay not rings but wash
my color did not come out it did not
whatsoever bleed out and that is great
that means his hair was properly colored
and a hair I mean the color properly
deposited into the hair so that it would
not
run whatsoever I would not people keep
saying oh you should I'm read the bottle
a darker pink I don't want to do that I
like it like this I like it all this one
solid pink color it's very blood china
you know so if you guys are interested
in this awesome color I told you guys
and it begin in the beginning of this
year I'm going to start doing things
that I normally wouldn't do because I'm
tired of black hair
I'm tired of 1/b I'm tired of sick 13
and I'm tired of brown so yeah this may
not be your everyday look but if you're
looking for something for Halloween
you're looking for something for a
costume party you're looking for
something cuz you just tired of one be
in a one I would I would hit it up I
will hit it up um my frontal stops right
here and then my tracks are here in the
back again my shedding has been zero and
I don't know what it is a lot of times
when I get lighter hair um I tend to
have way less shading in it then I would
have in darker hair which is really
weird because you would think that
they're darker hair will be less because
it's supposed to be non processed in um
a virgin so it should have no issues but
why is the process here doing better
than nothing big questions we all like
to know right so hit the links below let
me know how you guys like these um this
hair in these vendors and if you guys
have I'm just gonna give you guys this
i'ma let y'all pick my next color what
color do you think I should do next and
do not say purple because purple is
actually coming up so don't say purple
so anything else besides the pink and
purple which color do you wicked to rely
on green we can do blue we can do I like
brown uh not like not the light brown
are you doing maybe a honey blonde um a
lavender I'll give y'all lavender
because I do like this a pastel get down
that I have going on I really do like
this

shout out to buy lace wigs for actually
properly sending out beautiful process

anybody asks I actually brought another
bundle of this hair by myself with my
own money again from a different address
that they didn't know because I wanted
my hair to be um I did my tracks a
certain way where I needed some more
hair at the top it's super full but I
just needed one more button I don't even
