awesome okay so I know you guys are like
that looks just like your other week and
I know this is actually not from the
same company though this is a Brazilian
26 inch fully lace wig it's a silky wig
from buy lace wigs calm this is a
company that contacted me and you guys
know I've been wearing the brakes off of
my other wig so I was like I want
another wig that I can kind of alternate
the two instead of wearing one out I can
kind of like wear one and then alternate
into the next one so I couldn't exactly
well I didn't cut it exactly the same
because you guys know my other work had
like these right here it was like these
real blunt cut and then I had to go and
do the layers like I wanted to normally
my layers usually are not that short I
like them like this where they're there
but they're not so noticeable and I do
like that wick for that reason so I have
two different options they're the same
color they have the same cap
construction the only difference is this
company Souls their tags into the back
of the wig so it has like a t-shirt tag
in a barrack which is fine it doesn't
bother me at all it was for lace I did
the same method that I did with the
other wig that I'm gonna give away with
this one I've been wearing this wig for
about four days now yeah I think yeah so
about four days now and I love it
I absolutely love this week it is um I'm
not gonna say it's better than my other
week but what I will say is that is
fuller than my other wig I think that
other wig was a hundred percent density
this one is 120 and that extra twenty
percent did make it makes a world of a
difference in this hair and how it moves
and how it flows and how it glides my
other one the glides it flows too you
know I love it
and this wig is new or two I've you know
I've worn that one out too
and that hair is a little more trained
so this hair does not want to stay pin
straight as long as that one does this
one got a little poofy on me last night
um but other than that though cause it's
new like when you get fresh wigs they're
not gonna be you know super late age and
that other one that I have - it did take
a while for it to get like that so it
did take a minute so I'm Paula G was I
flat ironed it I laid it down now this
one did take a little more work and it
could be because I did it on my head
um but it did take a little bit more
work when I had did it because I was
watching I forgot what it was and it was
a whole entire episode my timing was
finished I had just got finished like
just getting the hump out and getting it
to lay like this but aside from that I
have gotten a little bit of shedding
it's not been a you know crazy but I did
I did get some um like I said usually
after you finish styling your wigs and
stuff like that you don't get as much
shedding after the fact it's like when
you usually first get them they want to
get kind of tangled and things of that
nature but as it's been on my head like
it's not buckling back here it's not
giving me any issues or problems um I'll
give you a close-up of what my little
lace looks like um and I just put some
concealer in my part I didn't I didn't
share that in the other video because I
didn't actually apply it but after you
apply it flip the wig inside out and
then wherever the part is some concealer
and a like a eyeshadow brush and just
brush up the inside of the wig and then
brush the concealer in there so when you
put it on it'll look like that but it's
not all this concealer right here if you
good with your hands and you got a nice
angled brush then you take the angled
brush and then you just go down your
part with the concealer and that's
whatever whatever concealer works best
for your Scout color I'm like a my
concealer is lighter than me so that's
why it's so vivid and bright and it
matches um my scalp right here I've seen
a lot of people who watch my tutorials I
see you guys make a flawed mistake and
that is you guys like to do this right
here where I put edge control right here
and I have to do that because I have a
Eddy or a little speakers people like to
call it and I can't do anything about
that um instead of put some edge control
on it
and kind of push it back into my
hairline if you don't have a widow's
peak didn't don't do that because it
just makes your wig look real Whiggish
and it looks like you're trying to hide
something or you don't know how to blend
properly so don't do that um leave it
exactly like it is whatever your
hairline does and you just push it in
there and then you pull it out I didn't
really go in depth into my part into how
it usually looks is it looks real
straight and narrow I didn't do that cuz
I'm um I'm about to go to my friend's
party or whatever so I'm gonna put a hat
on because I go to my office um so yeah
I'm not about to go through all them
steps but yeah this wig is actually very
nice it I don't know it just flows
different and it could be like I said
because it's new it could feel different
but in three weeks we'll see exactly
what it does in three weeks if it hold
up to my other champion one like it's
been doing but it's nice like the luster
I mean it does oh I got the Goss to be
glued that he'll I mean the beyond the
zone oh that does help but just look how
nice this is like your hair should all
if you were straight bone straight hair
it should look like this it should be
nothing less than this um and there are
a nice company to the person that I
spoke with was very nice to me so I'm
happy again they were very sweet they
let me pick any wig that I wanted of the
pros and the cons though let me get to
there's some things about this week that
I do not like the baby hair on this wig
is a lot it's a lot um it's because like
up under here like right here it's great
because it blends with my little hair
that I have left out for my braids y'all
got me some fresh um but it does blend
with that hair very well but the only
thing about it is they're very short and
up in here there were it was kind of
short right here when I were party
so now that it's laid down though you
can't tell but if I was to wear like a
flowy style I would have to kind of
train the hair into whatever direction I
wanted it's just not gonna lay like that
naturally that's what I didn't like lace
how the lace was constructed it was
usually when you get a wig
these are coolest wigs but we usually
glue this wigs I don't know the
difference between a glue this week and
a glue wig
the only difference I know is sometimes
the cap is a little bit different but
they have the lace around and since I
put it behind my hairline this is not
gonna be a problem for me but if you're
gonna bond it down it was like kind of
moon shaped around the entire thing and
usually the lace will go as your
hairline goes but it would just went
straight around but actually the cap is
not like that
like the actual dividends around the
hairline they're not like that but the
lace itself just goes all the way from
the back all the way around it usually
is two separate pieces so you just cut
the front off and then you cut the back
off but no but I didn't really it it
just cuz it took me too long to cut it
off really that's really what it was um
but those are the only major things that
I found wrong with this wig the company
has good a good sale and they have
actually good wigs because this is one
of the better wigs that I've gotten in
quite some time I love them all for all
different reasons but you guys know that
my heart is always gonna be the bone
straight black hair like this is just my
signature this just works for me so you
can't go wrong with this um I want to
keep this wig I do but I feel like I
have it so I feel like I should like
give it away
I don't know I'm giving it all away like
this hmm I don't know and just as an FYI
I have a wig sale coming up for all you
guys who are looking to buy some of the
weeks that I no longer wear or just
don't need anymore who knows but yeah um
again this is from bye lace wig calm wig
calm and I love the fact that they gave
me a picture of what the wig is because
this actually helps but these are the
baby here that I'm talking about that
are just ridiculous and I will be will
bomb them down and they pull them down
I'd like
with bangs but I like the fact that they
gave me not only a picture but they gave
me all the information about the wig
sometimes when I have to put the stuff
in the description bar to explain it
sometimes it is held in hot water trying
to get the information because they
haven't sent it on waiting but let me
just go through these usually I have a
card but it's the same thing
um the lace color is a light brown so if
you're my color or a tad bit darker
light brown should work for you if you
are Caucasian or just really pale then I
will go with more of a nude looking or
transparent cap my cap size is a petite
so that's a small the hair density is
110 to 130 so like I thought it says
this is their stock their stock
percentage so there most people stock
percentage is a hundred there is between
110 and 130 so this is like more of a
natural natural like it's natural but is
naturally full you know it's not like a
girl in to put a trucker or two it
bonier the hair type is brazilian remy
hair i have two adjustable straps this
one does not have adjustable straps in
the back it's just a really snug cap
which I find it'd be much better because
I usually put like a strip of tape up
underneath my legs to keep it down but I
didn't have to do that at this time so
you think winning across the board combs
it has three columns as um one right
here one right here and then there's one
in the back and then um alright um you
know see this is so sweet
so yeah I love this wig oh I can't say
it enough you guys know this is my go-to
look so make sure you guys check out my
lace wigs comm and then I'll be back to
do a an update on this particular wig
and let me go let you guys know and I'll
make my decision if I'm gonna give it
away during that time or not I don't
know but um you guys eat soon I have so
much more to come up I have more reviews
up some more updates on some of my other
hair like my gray hair and a drama
surrounding that so I'll talk to you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
