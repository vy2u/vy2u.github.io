the executive realness look it's not
exactly so executive realness if you see
what kind of pants I have on right now
but we hang on it's gonna act like that
oh man right so um to my hair it is I
went for like a Kim K behind-the-ear
deal so that's why my edges are so late
because I had to put on a lot of edge
control to make this look work ya know
so this wig is from buy lace wigs and
the wig happened to be inspired by mr.
miss beyoncé and I think it's less
necessarily less than like not his style
per se cuz obviously she has a side part
and I have middle part but it's more so
the color but not really because this
definitely doesn't match this it's the
darker color um so I'm gonna turn around
so you guys can see what it looks like
from the back and then see the color in
its entirety giving a little creature
right now just like so yeah guys this
this is what the color looks like
alright so I keep pulling this like I
got a boob but I feel like each and
everything is gonna go like this like
that's what I'm filming so this is their
unprocessed Brazilian hair and um this
hair is definitely unprocessed and I'm
gonna tell you why because it you see
how it kind of gets a little big and
it's a little frizzy because natural
hair does that you see here a lot of
times and I I were a lot of this hair
where it's not necessarily processed
with chemicals but it still process
because it's like pin straight and that
works for me I'll take that because this
is the
prepare that wall after it does what
real hair does in the elements it gets
very um poofy you know so it'll it was
SuperDuper straight like four hours ago
but not anymore
uh-huh yeah so this is the color number
two-tone it's Brazilian hair it's silky
straight so I was wondering like why my
lace was looking a little funny and
that's because they gave me transparent
lace and normally I would like Brown
lace so I had to put a lot of concealer
in the middle of my part so I'm not
gonna get close cause I think you I
usually wear like running the reason why
I don't like transparent lace is because
a lot of times it just comes off gray
like it just makes you look like you
have a great heart I have a small cap
and I don't have a silk top so this is
definitely um they said between 110 and
130 density but I'm definitely gonna say
that it's um for sure 110 because it's
not very full but the reason well that's
the reason why I was to do this
particular hairstyle with this wig is
because it wasn't very full when you
pull things behind your ear and you do
this with like tracks tends to get a
little big up in here and it starts to
look lumpy but I wanted this very sleek
and flat look except for this side and
he doesn't put the Hakone when they're
11 mom um but I wanted to do with this
because I knew it was going to be
SuperDuper flat and it was gonna lay
down for what I needed so you can do
this style with the wig you just have to
make sure that your wig is very flat and
I would get a full lace wig to do it not
a lace front but a lace because you push
part really far back but again they
always give me great wigs
I've never had an issue with their wigs
and I haven't known any of my
subscribers have issues with their wigs
neither um have a shedding issue and for
this wig I should not um I've never had
an issue with partying and this is a
free system it's a full lace wig so
therefore I can part it wherever I want
on my head in the time I have no issue
with our colouring if I wanted to
probably lift this color I could because
it is unprocessed that indicates that
there is nothing in the hair and that
means I can lift this to wherever I want
and it should be okay
the problem with when you are lift
processed care you don't know what's in
it so if you put bleach on it and they
start to turn the funny colors because
the bleach is reacting to whatever was
in the hair and then you really just
don't know what it is which then ends up
being wrong uh so yeah um but it's
actually very nice hair is very soft but
I definitely know I can feel the
difference between this hair and some of
my virgin hair like unprocessed virgin
I'm seeing now because I have some other
guy that I haven't reviewed yet but I've
been testing it out is also unprocessed
and it does definitely feel very
different um because virgin hair can be
virgin if that's what they're saying it
is but also if it has been processed in
a natural way you can still say that
it's a virgin hair that hasn't been
technically tempered with uh only way
you can save it or you can save your own
but the only reason why I would say
something is not virgin if I get a hair
color that's like a for understand is
virgin Indian or virgin brazilian
version Peruvian but it's a four it's
not virgin it probably was but you're
still younam's they should be virgin
hair previously that has been processed
to this you know a lot of times people
are not very clear on when they describe
certain things so that ends up being
something like a issue and a problem but
I do like this week um it's not exactly
my pillar meyer is definitely like a -
um whoa my hair is like a 1b not a dude
otherwise this will manage um so it's
not add but it's dark enough so I could
get away with it not in person I don't
think I can get away with this but on
camera I feel like yeah this photo cuz
y'all can see my fans I feel like yeah
you could you know can't really tell
fail um again this is from little ballet
Suites and um if you want to know any
more about their wigs please check the
