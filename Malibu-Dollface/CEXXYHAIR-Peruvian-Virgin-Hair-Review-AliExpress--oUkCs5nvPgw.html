love my buddy Ben yeah yeah okay guys so
I'm gonna review my hair that is just so
short I'm gonna scream right now because
you guys know I'm not a short hair
posted by a longshot but this hair again
is from Aliexpress we're still trying
y'all we're still trying to figure out
what's good and what's not what's hot
and what's not with miss Alex price so
this year that I'm working right now is
from a company called sexy hair but it's
for the scene a mess it's more sexy with
sexy got two x's okay these are these
came with all my bundles I have three of
them in mind you only three bundles pray
pray for my more realistic folks that's
what I did this look for y'all and then
each bundle came with one aviv and then
it came with this sexy hair strip and it
was tied around each bundle i have in
three bundles which is which are a 20 or
80 and a 16 if i'm not mistaken and then
i have a 16 inch sub lace closure in i'm
get closed
mmm chuckwei's closure in from closure
store of course i've had to tear for
some time now I've watched it twice just
to see how I was going to hold up and I
also put a nice little brown rinse on it
just to kind of give it a little bit of
a a bit of a color but I didn't want it
to be like too much you know too much of
a color but just like a little bit of a
range because it is virgin hair that's
what they're classifying it as you know
virgin hair means it has not been
processed it has no color in it it has
nothing in it it came straight off the
dog's head and put on to left and it was
sold so that's what this is supposed to
be this is what they're telling me that
it is yes so far so good
I'm the one of the things that I don't
like about this hair is the fact that it
ain't food you know not it isn't for it
ain't food that's what I don't like on
when they told me they were going to
me three bundles I wasn't excited about
it um but again I didn't pay much
attention when they were saying that I
was kind of like okay well this is a new
vendor hopefully they say that they said
we have some of the best hair her done
many times but we have some of the best
hair and we really want you to try so
I'm like okay but then again I thought
about it and I'm like what everybody
does and we're again five bundles of
hair some people are to bundle three
bundles higher deck to run those legit
you're not putting in a full way you're
not going to get three bundles I mean
two bundles and fully if you do is going
to be a scarcely thing with this hair
only thing I did was I put layers just
here in the front as you can see for the
bank piece and over here you know to add
some layer here so that this can do this
and can give a little valium because I
feel like when hair is really short you
need to put a little volume in it or
it's going to be really flat which it
would have been like my previous review
which one I had the middle part
everything was just bone straight and
flat I do like the hair I don't think
that the hair is top quality hair like
it's not my favorite hair I'm not
screaming or raving about it it's not
something that I have never had before
however on a budget like I always say if
you guys are looking for a budget hair
then this would be the way to go and
that's why I'm doing these out Express
reviews because I'm trying to give you
guys an opportunity to get something
that looks nice that's not pack hair and
shout out to all my not pack hair weird
people out there shout out to you I was
once one of those people no longer in
that person because I just don't feel
like that here is a quality for things
that I'm trying to do this hair is very
very soft and it cut like a dream that's
why I so fluffy and it was great to curl
these curls have been in here for a
minute except for the front part I had
to reco this part but all the other part
you know everything else is just this is
how I've been wearing a hair for the
most part shedding shedding is very
minimal it's not crazy I get a I canna
strand every now and then like yeah it's
not an 8 listen there's not enough hair
to be
in the first place okay so who's
shedding with three bundles that's he
does have a very natural look to it like
it's not super duper thick it's not
super duper thin it just has like this
natural feel for it you guys know I'm
just not used to wearing my hair this
short like oh I just in and for a while
I've been doing like shorter looks um
and I haven't had I don't think I've had
any here past 24 inch in like six months
which is killing my soul right now like
I can't take it here it definitely um in
my opinion is decent hair and my name
from a scale of 1 to 10
I'll give them a nice strong 7 the
reason why I won't give them a 10 or
even a 9 is because of the simple fact
that it's three bundles
it doesn't feel any different than any
of the other hair that I've received
from any other Aliexpress company I
would give or take a few but there's
nothing like different about this hair
there's nothing that makes you scream
you know bloody murder about this is
just is nice hair you know and again I
watched it too I watched it twice I
wasn't watching another time but I
didn't I co watched it twice as well so
I watched it and then I watched it just
to keep the moisture in because again
virgin air has a tendency to get very
dry the more and more you play um
sulfate on it you know which is of
course simple but sexier I'll give you
guys like in a nice strong seven because
this is some decent hair and I feel like
with in time this hair will kind of get
better because of the simple fact that
you can train it easier with this hair
because I'm here when you receive it
especially virgin here when you receive
it it's so straight that it doesn't want
to hold a curl or so curly that it don't
want to be straight and when I received
it I don't think it was a body wave in
it if I'm not mistaken it had more of a
natural wave I wouldn't say it was a
body wave at all but it I mean it's been
very nice I wore this to the store I
went to Target um and I just think that
it looks very natural for my natural
girls out there who just don't want you
know you know
right you know you want something very
poor you know I feel I just feel so dumb
you attention with this top on I
definitely need about it you know when I
last time I wore this I had I think 26
inches in you know so this is this is a
vast difference but hey so again this is
from sexy hair which is a good play on
words us that I almost say it says
Peruvian virgin hair that's what it says
on the thing so that's what this is this
is the Peruvian of virgin hair which is
great now they have care of hair
instructions on here and you guys know
how to feel about hair care instructions
I mean these are very important
especially for you guys who are new to
virgin hair or new lead period you need
to know these things because this is
going to prolong the life of your hair
if you buy something and you do not know
how to how it works on how to keep it up
it's like having a car if you buy a car
you don't know how to keep it up your
car is going to eventually go to hell
period and that's the same thing with
hair so if they given you if they're
taking their time not to print these
nice stock fit cards then it is good
that you would want to read them um and
it just has just simple things on here
avoid frequent washing to keep them
silky again that's another thing people
wash their hair way too often and
sometimes they Washington they don't
condition it I hear that so often oh my
hair is Maddie my hair shedding my hair
is dis my hair is that and then people
think that buying dollar suave is going
to help moisturizer hair that hair does
it does nothing but the total opposite
which tries out your hair so if you're
going to use something to use something
of quality I'm going to do an update on
my hair care products that I used only
because it's been a while I think it's
been like a year since I did it because
I did it with my gray hair but yeah so
we're going to do that but yeah they do
give you these so check them out again
they're sexy hair company on Aliexpress
I'll put all the info to my hair that I
have below and a lot of you guys always
act and I do always save but I guess you
know I got sitting in the closures that
I'm wearing from closure store or the
Silva's Russian um the Russian
great this one might be a bodyweight but
there is the same thing you just want
got away the window um but it's just a
basement that I always wear because I
feel like these closures that's for me
are the best um I'm going to do a video
about closures like lace closures versus
to waist closures and frontal so we're
going to do all that because a lot of
you guys don't understand the difference
between what and some people don't some
people still think a lace wig as a lace
front and that's not the same thing so
we're going to do a video about all of
that coming up so please be patient at
all of the stuff that I told you guys
that is coming is definitely coming so I
hope you guys enjoyed this I'll make
sure you guys check the links below
follow me on instagram at Malibu
Dollface and I will catch you all in the
next play and let me know you guys like
this hair I don't like it I just don't
love it and you guys know why I don't
love it but hey we'll see</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
