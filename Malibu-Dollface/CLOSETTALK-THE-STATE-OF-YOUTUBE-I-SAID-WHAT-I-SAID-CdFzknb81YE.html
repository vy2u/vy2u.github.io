it's piggybacking off of a video that
Diana aka Tootsie Tom had did yesterday
which is come like the state of YouTube
and where YouTube is and what's going on
and that whole thing and there was some
drama that had one I'm gonna call the
drum it was really just but whatever
that happened recently where a growing
YouTube that is known more for her
dramas and less for her beautiful voice
got a Riverdale and I put in the
comments of the shade room and all she
had to do to get it was Lyle I lie well
apparently a lot of people have issues
with that which is funny because I write
a lot of comments on a shade room and
never have I ever seen people get so
upset about like I was like okay so I'm
away to Malibu and I just it's like I
guess her fan base decided they wanted
to spam my Instagram with a whole bunch
of Chili Peppers which I don't get how
that's supposed to be scary only person
that you're really scaring is a bitch
with bad indigestion like us you can't
scare a person with emojis emojis are
not scary people they're not they're not
scary
the scary Simo G isn't scary but people
got upset and was like oh you're a hater
so of course you know the tea pages
I don't policy pages the only like drama
type of videos that I follow are people
that I follow or here for the tea petty
page Martin Lewis kind of like that
works like Beauty I don't really get
into that side of things um so in the
video their lives if you guys want to go
watch them feel free to do so I take I
still stand by what the I said I'm
not changing that um and this will go
into the title which is the state of
YouTube in a moment but what did you use
this as an example because this pretty
much proved my point
and people were upset with me so they
decided think that once they were
attempting to come into my comments and
tell me how dare you say this about her
I don't care I don't care I said what I
said and that's how I felt if you don't
agree with me that's fine there's a lot
of things that I don't agree with and I
just simply don't say anything about on
the shape of my calm comment almost
everything on the shade room but that
seems to be the thing that got people
all up in a feelings and that's fine I
got none personally it gives baby girl
cachet never did that to me I don't know
her like that but you have all of these
little kids who at the age of 14 have no
friends
gout you're talking you got two
followers with a private page telling me
about myself and what I'm not and what I
will never be and how I'm jealous and
how I'm cloud chasing and this work
cloud can we retire it please it's
terrible because the last time I checked
you can't use cloud to pay your bills
you get it they don't take it at the
Bailey's not mommy you know I don't ever
in my life I've never been a person to
start drama to get attention that's
never been my thing that's never will be
my thing
that's not how I roll now to the state
of YouTube and we'll get back to that in
a second YouTube has turned into a big
 mess okay when I seen Diana's
video yesterday when she was explaining
is I was like girl if you don't
preach it's a mess it's a whole bunch of
fake pranks it's a whole bunch of fake
drama it's a whole bunch of fake issues
it's a whole bunch of fake all of
these things they're stupid they don't
mean anything I remember getting on
YouTube and seeing people like Michelle
Phan it's a tree move and all of these
people who would get on here and do
something productive okay productive
when I first started YouTube I did was
talk I just said how I felt
I got known for literally having an
opinion so when now I think all these
years later having an opinion everybody
so butthurt about it and you if you and
this is nothing cuz I follow a lot of
low chem fan pages but if you're a fan
page and I'm just speaking from a person
to a person and you go into other
people's comments to defend the person
that you have a fan page of you should
definitely consider doing something else
with your time you should because let me
explain something to you if you took
that much energy out of your day and
your time to actually sit back and do
something that you love to focus on your
dream somebody make a fan page about you
you're not scaring anybody because
you're standing behind someone else's
icon with a private page with two and
three uploads there are people who say
things about me every single day every
day okay on other peoples pages and I
never say nothing I don't get in there I
don't say nothing I went on a couple of
these tea pages and stayed in a hotel
it is what it is and I'm not taking it
back and if you feel a way about me
having an opinion about her and and in
the things that I'm saying then maybe if
that's not the image that she wants then
she should try to clean it up it's that
simple
well Robert Downey jr. dude we didn't
want to be seen as a liability and a
problem anymore he made sure he cleaned
up his and became Iron Man and he
was that because this whole jealousy
thing I find it very funny because I'm
not a singer I do runs on here all out
of key not on key not in the pocket
whatever you want to call it and I don't
I don't have a desire to be an artist by
any chance so somebody getting a record
deal it doesn't know it doesn't do
anything for me at all it does it
congratulations
but let's be clear here to get in a
record deal today is not what it was
back then Danielle for Goldie aka catch
me outside
whoo I happened to follow and I like
because she funny and she listened hi
bitch is my jam okay so she got a record
deal not because she was the best rapper
in the world because she has 12 million
followers that's what she got it so a
person was so talented and their voice
was all of this inside the other why did
it take for you to go through all it is
and and being all of this drama just to
give all of these followers to only get
the deal then why wasn't as soon as you
open your mouth from sign you get what
I'm saying
so that's what I took from it and again
it's my opinion okay
no it'll be different and I could only I
could really understand how somebody
felt if I went to went to her page and
wrote it I wrote on the shade room where
I write all my other comments
that they post about other people she's
considered a celebrity so okay
what what kills me is that people want
to automatically assume that you're
doing it because you want for whatever
reason somebody to know who you are I
just did a worldwide campaign with Kat
Von D the last thing I need right now is
to be into some drama with somebody that
I don't know about an opinion that was a
one-off coming you get what I'm saying
like that's what I'm talking about
that's the I'm talking about I
don't have to do that I don't have to
put my relationship on the Internet in
order for people to follow me just
didn't say get my song I don't have to
do that if that's what she got to do
that's what she got to do but all I'm
saying is what I said wasn't a lie and
people would rather love you for the lie
then they'll hate you for the truth and
that's fine with me but will you have
people on YouTube and not even just her
Logan Paul all these other people who
get on YouTube and they use the platform
for such ugliness when you see people
like myself or ie or lakiya or Tootsie
time or peak meal or you know I can go
on and on and on who actually put
quality into their videos that are not
drama based that don't have this this
issue and this problem and these are not
videos that really do anything other
than perpetuate but people already think
about you know I'm saying I'll watch
these people like that but when I sit
down and watch certain channels that do
talk about these people then I'm just
kind of like oh girl this is a mess you
know but the creative bone of YouTube is
gone okay it's gone and for true
creators and people who actually get up
in here and do the things that's not
something that you just like really you
get I'm saying like but I'm sure there's
people who feel the same way about
myself all he do is hair videos that's
it well that's fine but I think if they
wrote it on my page I'll reply they
wrote it somewhere else I don't care so
as a fanbase if y'all any of y'all in
here who with me who like me who
don't like me whatever the situation is
if you ever see somebody talking
about me don't fight them in the
comments - it's free and
the people who supported me ain't no
free lunch eating bitches no and nope
nope I'm gonna give you about two or
three comments if that and I'm out
you're gonna just get the block that's
it
you never saying I don't know her
personally they shouldn't make it
something because me and partner know
each other and all of a sudden it I'm
doing it and doing her dirty working
it's funny how people come up with
conspiracies that have nothing to do
with nothing what that girl does what
her life and who she's wit has nothing
to do with me but furthermore what it
does is it perpetuates the fact that
there are people who sit here and they
comment and they have these issues and
they do the exact same thing that I did
well because therefore the person
they're lovers sometimes if you tell
somebody the truth sometimes it'll hurt
a little bit is that simple if somebody
drove all the time I don't always feel
good but it is what it is I don't it
isn't it doesn't affect me in such a way
but I also make sure that I don't put
nothing into the atmosphere into the air
onto the internet that will later on I
guess you could say hate me and such a
negative life or say things about people
that are nothing nice and things to say
and again if you feel like that that's
fine but you know there's been comments
made about a girl's hair and you know
all types of stuff and there's even
though that's her opinion and it's not
wrong you will offend somebody it's that
simple you get what I'm saying so it was
that whole thing but for you to be mad
at me for stating my opinion on my page
but yet and still you can't even upload
an icon or your page is funny I live in
California I played at the Capitol
building trust me
after hours I have no one to go up in
there now I don't I wish you the best I
just hope that all these people that are
in these comments that are coming at me
and ain't so mad at me buy it out I hope
all y'all up in here got all of these
pages just to get noticed it wouldn't
after that would you do with yourself
you buy a single I hope so because the
worst thing that's gonna come out of is
you did all that fighting and then
nothing happened you got him saying
their people had a lot to say about why
did he get the campaign with Kat Von D
he doesn't even do makeup like that he's
more of a him a person why is he doing
it I
people like all this person said this
about you I said don't say nothing
let him talk don't say nothing because
it's not that deep I still got the
campaign okay I was in support and they
were not she signed and I am not so why
are you mad why does my opinion mean so
much you get what I'm saying
why does my opinion hold so much weight
why it's an opinion everybody has one
but he just goes to show that in this
world that we're in people would rather
be liked for something they don't agree
with then crucified for something that
they truly believe in and I'll give the
Kanye in another video cuz I know that's
where it's going go we'll talk about
kinda in another video but yeah YouTube
the state of YouTube it doesn't make us
one I know you guys are wondering like I
have a really did like a dope intro and
along you have a did it and it's because
based on even when she said it I was
like girls eh you don't want to put
forth all this effort you're saying
should do something that you know is not
going to necessarily get the views that
you wanted to give for the amount of
time and effort you put into it you're
giving them saying like you wouldn't go
to work and work all these hours and
then you know you about to not get no
cheque from it you know cuz that's the
incentive is the money you know I'm
saying some what I love what I do and I
put as much passion as I can and what I
do but at the same time all of what I'm
doing is not a cheap process all of what
I'm doing is not a you know I have to
buy these things and a lot of these
things I do by myself I don't have a
team of people doing it for me you know
I'm saying there's a lot of people I
know with over a million subscribers and
a million followers who can't get a ring
like to save their life you know and
they're not look they're not putting
money into their production but they're
doing stupid dumb that gets really
quick clicks but then their videos get D
monetize because it's kind of seen as
not the thing to do you know and I never
want to be a person who start to put out
content for the of it because it's
just the thing to do
oh it's a challenge oh let's do it I
know the challenge it was stupid that
was the dumbest just like that
cayenne pepper was stupid you
and people like that I'm just not the
person and give it to you and because
somebody does something doesn't mean
that I have to agree with it but at the
same time it doesn't also mean that I
have to not agree with it in silence or
not say anything in silence if I really
had a vendetta against somebody and why
would I wait that somebody got Stein and
doing something that I don't give a
flying about to say something about
it while I would have figured this out
or said something a long time ago if
that was my point you get what I'm
saying like some people think they try
to be so calculating about things and
say you're that way I don't think that
hard about it
I really don't a lot of these people
that I know follow me only follow me for
what I can give them they could care
less about what happens to me they just
care about what I could give them and
I'm fine with that
that's why I don't give more than I'm
willing to give such as my personal life
who I'm who owned wait boyfriend
tax husband tax girlfriend tax whatever
the situation is you know I'm saying
even with my friends I really pulled
that back too because I just don't want
her friends on my channel like that
because people want to go and then try
to dig up stuff on them or say stuff
about them that's just not cool you know
so if since I started to see a thing
that was happening I stopped doing it
you know look back to what I was saying
about the whole wanting to do certain
things for you too it's that's just like
you know when you do certain things you
want the gratification to know what's
going on and it's like so the core
people who are watching this video right
now would love for me to continue what
I'm doing with just sitting here talking
to y'all face to face behind Chile feel
from my heart doing him talking about
this and talking about that and then
this cool you know I'm saying and then
there's other people who come for
specific things they come for just hair
they come for just wrote me no closet
talks they comfort just you know
tutorials they come for just whatever
I'm doing you know I'm saying it just
depends on what you're doing but it's
very irritating and it's very
aggravating and it's a very knowing as a
content creator and a lot of y'all don't
understand what we say and it just seems
like we're just sitting here complaining
oh my god you guys make all this money
and all you want to do is complain and
it's not about complaining it's about
the platform that you're owing doesn't
seem to appreciate what that you're
trying to keep what the original intent
was I become a right here right
now and do a challenge video and get a
million views it's not hard to do I can
concoct a fake relationship with another
youtuber or a random that you don't know
who's just trying to get on and cut and
make a shitload of videos I mean this
person ain't never kissed each other
before I can do that and I know for a
fact that I will get millions and
millions and millions and millions of
views because there are people who are
literally living vicariously through me
trying to see what this is but later on
we're gonna go get on a forum and talk
 out of the Wolves eye about me in
this person I know how this works
I'm not stupid I get it you know but it
sucks where in order for you to get what
you put forth you have to pretty much
show yourself short and put everything
that you feel out there in order for
people to see what the core of you is
and that's where the problem is that's
where the state of YouTube is that's
where everything is you know I'm saying
and you're catering to people who are
literally gonna film a dead body and
call it a day or do rap battles that you
know ain't real and you support in this
 because you feel like it's
entertainment when it's some of the
corneas should have ever seen him a
 life like I don't really like
this like this got you but I
get it I'm not mad at it people try to
make it seem like you so mad at you so
judges do you really think that I sit
here all day and think about what
somebody else is doing with their life I
followed it I'm one of the one of the 12
million people who follow the shade room
I got an opinion
then comments B and I
looked like this
again to to the girl shout out to you
girl it up go platinum go triple
platinum do what you gotta do I said
what I had to say I don't take back what
I have to say it's not changing up over
here so if as a fanpage you feel that
you got an issue and a problem with me
that's completely fine but I would
suggest that when you do see me after
your non paid gig gives you your check
pull up say something
that's it you you'll be you'll be in LA
I usually put my location on mypos oh
look it's that simple you know people
love to talk really tough and hard on
the internet but then you see them and
it's oh mike i've yet to meet a person
I'm telling y'all right now I'll get to
meet a person will say anything negative
to me it's always I love you I care
about you I love your videos I love your
content I've never met a person who had
a real issue at me and I think I have a
lot of people who don't like me but yet
still I'm only meeting the people who
like me interesting so yeah that's
really what his head is at across words
do I think that YouTube will get better
not sure but I can say that I do feel as
if at a point um I just feel like you
gotta remember people are gonna have an
opinion about something that you put out
to the world okay just best for her her
fan base for everybody just hear this
whatever you put through the world is
what the world would use against you
whatever you put through the world is
what people will have an opinion about
of you if I was a stripper
you see cardi party out here winning and
people still talking about she was a
stripper she did she did she did she did
it she wasn't living him up the girl got
a gold album hella singles and y'all
still talking about her being a stripper
so remember what you choose to put out
to the world it's something that
sometimes you can't always erase that's
why I don't let my relationships and
friendships and all of that get to the
world cuz it's none of nobody else's
business and if your intent was to sing
baby you should have been singing since
came out not addressing everything on
lies and not going back and forth I
don't do this you know I'm saying
because my hands got a my today on and I
really ain't one for the for the talking
and not even for her but for people who
want to support her and try to denounce
me Robin caught everything but a shot of
God by these kids and most these
 gotta be sleep by
 on a clock anyway so
that's why I'm like it's not even that
but at the same time don't try me cuz
I'm not the one don't try to get you
bitch cuz I'm not the one cuz it takes
more than a little emoji to scare
me trust and believe that okay so again
ain't no smoke I don't issue were her I
don't even know her like that and feel
though who you called her a bitch I call
everybody a bitch
everybody's a bitch bitch everybody a
bitch so again don't try to dip in point
it in deconstruct my terminology because
you're trying to find a needle in a
haystack to have a problem girl most of
you bitches will never land in my city
of Daniel life it's a
scream say Ryan mother dude ever job but
anyway I hope you guys enjoyed this and
I will catch you guys tomorrow
