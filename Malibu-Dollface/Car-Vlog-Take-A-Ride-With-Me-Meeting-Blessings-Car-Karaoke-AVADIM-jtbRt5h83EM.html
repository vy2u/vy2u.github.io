real ridiculous once I get there extra
 late for no reason so we shall
see what happened we shall see how this
goes so I hope you guys are enjoying a
video a day and many of this far and I
think it was it's so far it's not as bad
as I thought it was gonna be you guys
know it's really hard for me to kind of
keep up with stuff especially when I
have to do it on a consistent basis if
it's not just videos so it's a little
harder usually come on Google Maps waves
somebody
okay let's see what they gonna do
well they may actually let me get on a
different freeway because I want to
Oh lunch okay when you trying to do
something and it just is not working on
your favor
I make it looks nice oh so yeah I'm just
kind of I'm excited not like I said I'm
not really crazy nervous or anything
about the situation like it seems like
it's gonna be a positive one so I'm just
taking for what it is but I really hope
this works out the hook-up that I got
this room is amazing and it's an when
things do come through I'll tell you
exactly who it was and they're somebody
who's actually on one of my favorite
shows ever every guy's known
I forgot my earring Danny I know
it's gonna be something it ain't one
thing with me it's whatever I got enough
other jewelry on some shitty bottom okay
please on the crowd II would be gooder
in a timely fashion have to be here till
15 so I'll get there 15 minutes
look what 7 I should be okay
we going away he looked like he was
gonna try to
yeah
all right
I'm just excited like all the things
that have happened for me so far this
year have been a freaking amazing and a
blessing like it's always like one thing
after another
it was the Steve Aoki video before that
it was like four things and now it's
this and God knows what and they just
keep happening back to back and I'm just
grateful that I'm counting my blessings
but what they are at this particular
point goes man everybody ain't freaking
able I'm just happy to be in this
position like have you guys ever just
like thought about your life and you
ever thought about like saying I'm so
blessed to be in a position that I mean
it could've been anybody but I got it
very happy I'm very grateful I'm very
humbled by the situation and I just want
to thank you guys personally from the
bottom of my heart thank you guys for
rocking with me for so long because a
lot a lot of my
opportunities are coming from the type
the audience that I've built with you
guys and I say this all the time but
it's very true that you guys definitely
help in such a major way with us
youtubers and internet personalities to
get great opportunities for us to be
able to live our dreams and I don't
think a lot of times people look at it
like that like come on
blaze I got somewhere to be
this is a job that meet me and I always
want to have a positive experience with
me I want to talk to you all I need to
know you let me know your name I
probably on Instagram I want that type
of relationship with the people that
support me because without you guys it's
pretty much nothing you know I'm saying
young god got my back like a chessboard
Epps and I can only be as gracious so
for me to take time out of my day to say
hey how you doing because you recognized
me at Target does not hurt a lot of
people for a game that you are a fan of
people - you know I'm saying you have
people that you look up to - so why
would you not give and offer this person
the same respect that you want from your
favorite person you may you know said
rather be used to personality or singer
being respectful guys because you never
know who you're gonna run into and this
person that you may not think does
anything and I'm not saying do it
because they may be somebody I'm saying
do it because that's the way you want to
be treated -
be gracious and be happy and be
appreciative of your opportunities no
matter how big or small they are an
opportunity and a blessing into what it
is so we're gonna take that and take
what you will from you and go on and
become something great and be somebody
that you can be proud of 10 years 12
years 11 years down the line and I'm
saying but I really accomplished
something and live your dreams guys stop
letting people's opinions about you
taint would you feel if somebody thinks
that what you're doing is stupid that's
fine but this is what brought a lot of
reason why I say in the beginning this
video I'm not gonna really say much
about the situation I'm just gonna go
ahead and do it and then I'm sure later
and there are a lot of people who get to
a certain point in their life and they
start to feel like oh I didn't need her
I did this on my own and it's like no
you didn't somebody looked out for you
some way around the line and it could
have been simply as referring your name
because in this situation that's exactly
what happened to me somebody referred my
name who has a hell of a career that I
didn't even know knew me or anything
about me and come to find out this
person's children watch me on YouTube
and they heard about a project and I
just happened to come up you know but
again I think if I was an asshole and I
had very bad business practices I don't
think I would have been considered
because even though this person is
accomplishing it where they aren't they
don't know me
all right I'm literally like here's 12
out of 15 minutes
to do what I got a soul the way you love
your loving me all right
not what you want me to do now you own
your slop
I hate these bands yo these Hollywood
dream tour bands when you come to LA
don't waste your money they gonna tell
you where everybody don't live and
they'll have you in the wrong direction
so Jennifer Anniston lives here like she
doesn't even live in the area
that bitch is in North Hollywood with
Hollywood oh I hate coming I'll do
whatever when I was younger this is all
I ever did black this is just a whole
life and I can always sucks it's just a
word park impossible in history by
Hollywood um this is probably it's not
as bad as downtown LA let's say that
because downtown is a whole nother piece
but yeah if you're not parking in its
structure and a lot of times a lot of
these studios are in-between stuff so
you ever been somewhere like you
remember like coming as a kid and stuff
like that but then when you do it as an
adult like how it turns your stomach
that's kind of where right
my makeup looks so thank you everybody
who's giving me compliments on my makeup
learns yeah that's my says don't you
kidding
wish me luck I'll come back when it's
over let you know I win
so I just left the meeting anyway
amazing this company does like every
freaking shower watch they do plane yeah
it was amazing um positive energy the
particular person that I met I feel like
she's my homie bro she was super duper
dope yeah I'm just happy I'm so happy
I'm like I can't be any more ecstatic
right now and yeah I was only there for
like 30 minutes but it felt like we were
talking about great and wonderful things
that are upcoming for freaking ever so
um um I'm excited
this guy's excited yo for ya um thank
you guys so much for
watching my growth in my journey I think
people will often forget that everything
takes time everything is as a journey
everything is a moment everything has
its it's time to you know become great
and and that whole thing and my time it
seems to be coming now and I can't be
more excited and esthetic about it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
