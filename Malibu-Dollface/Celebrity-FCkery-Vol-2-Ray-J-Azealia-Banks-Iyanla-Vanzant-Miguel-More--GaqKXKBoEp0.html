I make music to know your brain okay
so we're gonna do a celebrity fuckery
right here in this bit that's hot air
sign right right now Joey's okay so the
first person that I want to bring up in
this so we can just get to the
motherfucking point is rage a rage ace
you hear me
Ray J I don't understand your situation
I've had the pleasure of meeting Ray J
several times in the past remember he's
the work for BT and he suited like the
corresponding work I had met him at oh
he used to cover like the premieres that
except that we used to go to if you
remember me from rice paper used to go
to like Hello premieres so he was always
nice this is before the Kim sex tape and
all that good stuff um I met him and him
at the one-on-one at cuts rap party I
think like back in 2006 if I'm not
mistaken he was with her at that's hot
nobody knew where the fucking Kardashian
was I thought she was Mexican before me
feel very honest I was like cuz she like
she was talking as if she was Hispanic
and I was like she panties and there are
girls like a no I think she like Persian
or something so I know she's Armenians
um so yeah I mean I've never known Ray J
personally to be like that until
everything's popped off and it seems
like him success really hurt him because
he thought that he was gonna gain
something from it only for her to gain
the shit from it and become like Miss
Kardashian and he's like or jokes so I
think that's he is that a small men's
pride where everything has to be the way
it is and he's gonna continue to huff
and puff and blow the house down into
somebody takes me seriously so you gonna
die trying cuz no one gives a fuck right
nobody cares you can and then you're
gonna have the nerve to say that you hit
it first from my understanding and it's
just correct me if I'm wrong but Michael
Jackson's
nephew
TJ hit it first that's him said she lost
our virginity to him so there you go I
don't know how true that either you know
kimi no Jo so I mean it is what it is
I'm not really sure about that situation
I don't really know but all I know is
Ranger you did not hit it first you're
gonna say it's not about Kim see I don't
like people who lie if you're gonna be a
man about the situation being man about
the situation if it was her it was her
you're gonna use our feature and say
it's not about hurts
wait no who the fuck you talking about
negro just being honest like why are you
gonna be you're gonna be so big bad wolf
in the studio only to be a punk in your
interviews like man the fuck up like you
talk buko shit about every any and
everybody you can't be honest about the
fact that it's about are you scared of
Kanye is that what it is that
motherfucker yeah he's crazy he is not a
sane one so I get it but yeah that's
just not cool the next person is Eric
Williams from basketball-wise you know
Jennifer Williams not hit an ex-husband
I'm not gonna really spend too much time
on him only because he's not worth it
but he did make some very just
disrespectful comments about the gay
community and gay people and basically
i'ma just give you the Cliff's Notes he
basically said that being gay and
letting children see it is very
different detrimental to their he didn't
use the word detrimental but you know I
don't think he that smart
um to their growth as human beings and
if you team gave you should be ashamed
of yourself and this is that any other
but I think it would be a little more
detrimental for a child to see a big
grown-ass back just a black man throw a
green apple martini in his then wife's
face as hard as he could I'm almost
certain that that right there will be
way more detrimental to their learning
abilities and learning to comprehend and
no way nice and mean means so if anybody
needs the motherfucking pat on the back
to make them understand life it may be
you I'm happy Jennifer had no children
with you because they would be royally
fucked and I feel very bad for the
children that you two have so off
because I really don't give a fuck about
him I really don't let me find out who
else I had in this list cuz it was quite
Oh hmm as on your banks now I'm not a
big fan of Azealia Banks I don't listen
to her music I've heard a few songs she
first came out or she does she does she
died whatever um but no I do not listen
to mrs. Errol banks however I am a big
fan of ASAP Rocky hey guys hey Rocky
that's my boo right there like I love
him I love his Ryman I love how he feels
about the gay community there is a
picture there are a few suspect pictures
of him online but you know that's his
business I'm not I don't never want to
out somebody you know I'm saying like I
think that's just really tacky and
that's what she did she basically said
that um he was gay and he used to get a
professional if you know what I'm
talking about if you knew Wendy Williams
before the show you know what a
professional is yeah um a professional
from his friend I forget the boy's name
and all that is to say she's talking
about and because he stated his opinions
and he doesn't feel that dark-skinned
women look good in red lipstick okay
that's his opinion just like some people
may have an opinion about me or about
you or about the next person and I don't
want to hear just cuz I like him that
I'm taking her for him because her
fiance said it had anybody else said it
that I'm not too fond of such as Beyonce
or Nicki Minaj I'm not gonna say that
they were wrong cuz that's still their
opinion and I think that you guys need
to understand that there is a thing
called you can think for yourself and
form your own opinions as a individual
so therefore that is your opinion and
that's what he decided to say she took
this shit all fucking personal bitch
first off if that was me and she had to
do it Mac so therefore I would have shit
it on young Blackwell Mac didn't think
so and they gave me my own shit so now
what you got to say there you go that's
how you read a motherfucker that's how
you do yo shit she didn't do that so you
need some motherfucking you need some
nice lessons boom why are you trying to
read my fuckers up on Twitter
you ain't you nobody takes you serious
you're a joke
just like Ray J you're a joke and I
think her issue is she's that she's not
talented that's not a problem
it's unless she's more fat mad at the
fact that a cell got his edges and she
don't you just say edgeless hater
that's what you are skeeball
like you late I can't without you bang
she's she's on some other shit and she
doesn't she's not in a place to
disrespect somebody over an opinion I
could see if it was a direct shot at you
to be disrespectful but he not too many
more shaders brighter than yo shaders
shades lighter than you like come on
chick like and you gonna fight with
somebody about something make sure it's
something valid please cuz you on that
bull she's like all the way on the bull
shit your side you know I cannot with
you I don't like you and she he's not
the only one she didn't follow Nicki
Minaj Luke him um some other chick some
other chick some other dude and another
chick so this bitch is on her 50 cent
shit i'ma let her beyond her 50 cent
shit I'm not gonna give her too much
today not too much the next person is
Miguel I like Miguel I'm not a big fan
of his music I'm over that adoring song
I'm not crazy about him but what I will
say is the fact that he's a talented
young man who reminds me of Ricky
Ricardo now he made comments and said
basically that Frank ocean coming out
the closet and saying how he felt and
who he was or who he is as definitely
has affected Frank's career as well as
his miss Miguel girlfriend
i'ma need you not to put no one else
yourself and no one else's position I
get what he's saying so I don't want to
get any emails don't know what he was
trying to say no I get it I get it what
do you wish I get it the point being is
the simple fact that what does that have
to do with you
like would how does that affect your
music how does that overshadow your
music are you gay are you bisexual or do
you need to say something cuz the way
Miguel is one of those artists that I
just looked at very funny due to the
simple fact that he he every time he
opens his mouth it's like what the fuck
are you talking about what I don't know
just saying shut up so I mean I'm not
taking him for Frank like that like I
don't think that Frank's coming out had
anything to do with the effect of his
music cuz he got it several I think he
got two Grammys he performed at the
Grammys he was good
Miguel performed and for somebody
informed me that he got a Grammy so what
the fuck
I mean he's mad at the fact that Frankie
won in the category that he didn't
necessarily feel Frank should have won
in that's an again an opinion everything
I just said in this video is an opinion
except for the facts about it though
your banks not having no edges now bitch
that is fast okay
skeeball but offer um yeah I just think
it's just very stupid for him to say
such I just Miguel just stick to singing
and stick to your own damn music okay
that's all you got to do that's all you
got to do and you're gonna be good you
good you talent it move you real
talented you good but no the next person
is y'all our vans in I don't know if her
name is Jana hey y'all um all I know is
I cannot stand her I don't like the way
she look I don't like the way she talk I
don't like her hair I don't like her
outfit I don't like her I don't like
shit about her but what really pisses me
off is she heard dramatics we are no
matter y'all not gonna be dramatic is
hella sometimes but I can't with her
because she's a baby it's all in you as
a man to get you right you know you
cannot I can't with her I just I don't
like her I don't like her period and
called me what you won't call me
whatever the fuck you feel I do not like
her and she just she just irritates me
she hurt dramatic and I think that
because her show is based off trying to
fix someone's like you are doing
everything but that boo you're ruining
these people's lives because you're not
helping you're just reiterating what's
wrong they get it they fucked up help
him I can't just
I was not talking about Justin Bieber
it's not he just needs to get his life
together stop hanging around stupid-ass
people you'll be all right um kaya I'm
not gonna go there for her uh Keyshia
Cole everybody wants to know my opinion
about Keyshia Cole and the things that
she said about Beyonce
I personally thought that her feelings
towards it was very valid she made a
valid ass point the only reason why
people didn't fill her is because she's
Keyshia Cole and that's Beyonce it's
kind of like you take it you pick in
Omarion over Chiefs way or Oprah over
Wendy Williams or you know it just it's
just like that like you don't get the
respect you deserve because of your rank
that's pretty much it regardless of what
she said was true or not she just
doesn't get the respect that she
deserves um in that aspect the things
that she said we're not necessary but
like everybody everybody has opinion and
just because you're celebrity doesn't
mean that you can't say what you feel
just like I said your base can say
whatever the fuck she want to say it's
still the fact still remains that she is
an individual she has the right to say
what she has she wants to say that's why
she has a password to our Twitter and
she can say whatever she wants
the problem is Keyshia Cole tends to say
the wrong things at the wrong time about
the wrong people in the wrong way he's
just a wrong bitch what's taking I'm
sorry whatever um so yeah Keyshia Cole I
just the stop tweeting bitch that's all
I got just stop tweeting you just don't
need to be tweeting more just let it go
just let it go um um I think that's all
I think that was everybody there's a few
people on my list all I was saying about
this about kaya is this you are tacky
ass nasty ass vile ass oh I hate you I
really hate you you you oh just every
your whole existence just makes my life
burst like it just makes her hurt I owe
like just shut up but she tried to come
from Beyonce she had come for a little
can't she'll come for everybody she go
ahead - no don't block me because of the
simple fact that I said what the fuck I
said about her yes you are little Wayne
stunt-double bitch get over it that's
your place play your role period
you ain't gonna become a sheet of Queen
the queen of woof woof pussy that's it
that's all sorry Caillou but ain't
nobody checking for you my neck my back
has been long gone
uh-oh Kuji on hear about that
accidental racist racist song that he
did lick the shit stupid next and I
think that's it I basically said
everybody on this list so yeah I mean
celebrities are stupid that's it
they have too much time and too much
money on the hands and they do dumb
things and we have we can sit back on
TMZ and judge them that's pretty much
what the fuck life is right now with
celebrity-filled and we feed into the
shit that's where I'm doing this video
right now so yeah um but yeah I I have a
dislike for everybody pretty much on
that list give or take a few people but
I'm not oh but you know I love ASAP
Rocky you know hey Rocky y'all tweet him
and tell him doll face love him I my
twitter is at Malibu dog thinks my
Instagram is Malibu dog face if you want
