and y'all will not even attempt to
understand how long I have literally
been here I have been through ten colors
in order to get back to today I'm blue I
don't know what it is with my hemorrhage
that's so stupid
when I do certain colors I have to
really go in and perfect the damn color
situation I'm hot I'm irritated so
anyway I felt like my intro humming now
I know I've used that song before but I
didn't I wasn't able to do it in the
capacity in which I just did it okay so
this hair that I am rocking is from
Seelye hair and Siva here is an al
Express brand and I've never worked with
them before but I'm going to go on
record right now by saying this is the
best straight hair so far that I have
had from aliexpress people do you get to
shake it okay trying to get closer y'all
can see because in the intro you can
only really see the shiny was given
because the lighting is now different
we'll be looking at as far as the sledge
honey you can always tell when the hair
is good I mean you can go like this and
literally get like no snag and this is
after a nice little brown rinse I'll put
on it just to make it a little bit
darker because I wasn't a fan of the
color it was but when you do this pearl
see that is what I'm talking about okay
now go ahead and bleach my frontal with
- bleaching method using a better I am
bleach I love and then my makeup I did
just very minimal makeup like this
I haven't have a makeup this like demure
since I started where am i go it feels
very different I feel like I'm missing
something which is I'm handling liner on
y'all know that's my favorite in it but
I look more like myself though so as far
as my limbs go I am rocking for 28 and a
20 inch free parting frontal now
although I love that hell out of this
hair I am NOT the biggest fan of the
frontal whatsoever and you want to know
why I'm not a big
senators consul this is the reason now
as you guys can see I wasn't able to go
ahead and glue all of this section down
you know uh-huh
but the problem is the air tab comes
like this okay and I hate when I see
people do wigs or wig reviews and they
have it glued down to here but then you
can't even put it behind your ear
because it looks like this does looks
like a drag wig I hate that now most of
the time when you do get frontal you're
going to get them where they're a little
bit too big like such and then you have
to go around and then pretty much take
it part it wear it and then go ahead and
cut it now as a probably like in the
last nine months
most of my front schools that I've
gotten the thing that I've been able to
do and I think I've been able to tell
the company is I need my frontal with a
certain um hairline and I needed to be
I'll just you know go ahead and measure
my head and it was they would send me a
frontal that's generally the size of my
head and I know that they do this is
because it's cheaper to just go ahead
and make them a little too big and it
will fit whoever but this ain't going to
work okay that ain't going work and
that's kind of one of the reasons why I
went ahead and made it a middle part too
is because I'm like this one but I have
other ones that are on the display to be
reviewed and they fit like perfect so I
know it's a possibility it's not like
I'm asking for something that is not
possible but if I from the frontal
itself as far as not fitting that's the
only thing that I have issues with it
bleached beautifully I have my knife
Kardashian part popping off folks and
pretty full as far as it and another
okay so another thing I'm not really too
much of a fan of in fact that it did not
come pre plus we are in 2017 season here
and I don't think we're going to need
some pre plus tonsils popping off
because I'm quite frankly for me and
what my schedules talking about these
days I don't have time to gliding like
re construct a frontal to be at least
give me a template because this was
definitely Barbie okay this was
definitely like 93 Barbie and I can't I
love Barbie to death but I don't want
hairline okay as far as the textures
that go between the frontal and the hair
after I did wash them I did notice there
was a texture difference between my
frontal and the hair and it wasn't huge
different I just had to put a little bit
more heat on my frontal then I have two
actual hair the hair seemed like it went
right back to what it was as opposed to
the actual frontal itself
it seemed like our frontal just needed a
little bit more heat and um a little bit
more hairspray while I fight ironed it
to get it back to the same list however
it does match beautifully it's not like
it's a big difference or anything like
that it definitely matches so not a big
thing just spend a little bit more time
on the frontal parted so my hair looks
hella flat because I just got some new
braids so yes she just that this hair
lays so beautifully flat and it's super
duper straight now for those of you who
are looking for some really good
straight hair I definitely would want to
present suggested hair just one tip of
advice when you do Washington's hair try
to use a shampoo that is it has silk end
of the title okay so for instance the
Giovanni's shampooed I love is the
smoothest silk that works very well on
this if you use something that's a
clarifying shampoo I've noticed that the
hair will not bounce back and be as
everything like such so I noticed that
if you do it with like a very huge
clarifying shampoo like this a lot of
that going on this hair is not going to
want to lay it straight and it does get
very staticky because it is processed
now I know that it says that it's virgin
but here is definitely been processed to
be straight like this okay know it I've
never got any straight hair that was
this straight
that was in process like this like I
always tell you guys this doesn't
reminds me of pack hair okay where you
get it in a super duper straight but
you've got to take care of it you got to
wash it with the right stuff and it'll
keep going back to that and I think
people don't understand that sometimes
like this is better for you than trying
to do the whole virgin thing because
virgin hair is like real hair like
real natural hair so it was going to
want to swell it's going to want to
tangle its going to want to do all of
the things that you don't want it here
depending on who the vendor is but when
it's processed like this it's easier to
take care of it it's easier to get the
result that I have right now I know a
lot of you guys be like well I ordered
the hair that you have and my hair is
not straight is there or it doesn't say
it straight or when I first got it it
was hella straight and now it's not like
that anymore you have to realize you
have to wash it with something that's
going to make sure that it's not going
to dry all of this luster out of it and
then you're going to be mad when it
looks like a crow's nest so if I am to
give the grading process with seen the
air I would definitely give them a nice
solid setting for while get the hair
itself
okay and as far as my fronts will go I
will give the front to a nice seven only
because the fact that I don't like the
fact that it don't fit and I don't like
the fact that it was in pre kuk so that
definitely takes it down a couple of
notches for me but if you do have your
own frontals and you don't necessarily
want to buy their frontal or you have
some just laying around or one you
really like you're going to just reuse
it then yeah this hair would be
everything like I said do not use a
sulfate super base cleansing clarifying
shampoo on this hair use something that
is going to make the hair silky try to
use um I usually say curly hair products
or whatever not nothing that says like
it's going to wave your hair because you
do you don't want to ruin that but
something that's going to hydrate okay
something that's going to be able to
make sure that your hair does not dry
out you do not keep treat this like
curly hair don't dry it out and it will
stay nice and fluffy like sides okay
girl
I haven't did a slight test in a minute
but Beibei anything if you guys can see
in my front I mean my frontal in my
intro it did a great job with keeping
straight for me happy to stand in that
damn pose for so long because but if you
guys are interested in this here make
sure you guys hit the links below for
silly hair let me know how you guys see
look so when as I pulled it it still
went back and this is after three washes
it's still topping
so let me know what you guys your hair
looking like when y'all get it if y'all
do order it let me know if it ain't
looking like this because you know I
will act up so I will catch you guys in
my next one
PTV peace and if you want to welcome a
somber in this video because it's like
3:00 in the morning and I'm trying so
hard not the way the dog and be loud to
my neighbor's sorry
