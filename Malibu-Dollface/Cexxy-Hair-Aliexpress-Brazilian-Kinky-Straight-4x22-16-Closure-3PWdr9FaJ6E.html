love you all
oh wait like 18 full of alright guys so
my hair it's like the more ethnic
version of Zatoichi
so this hair is from sex a hair and I'm
wearing they're Brazilian kinky straight
and this is very similar to some hair
that I just reviewed but it's a bit
different because I actually am like
totally in love with this area
oh they send me a closure which I went
ahead and bleached myself because it was
a lace closure and they sent me four
bundles of 22 inch of Brazilian straight
wood bazillion kinky straight how do you
want to say it now what I did was I went
ahead and just braid it here braid here
as you can see I left it a bit loose and
it looks very different from um what I
had once before because his hair is more
of a thicker texture so I'll show you
she has more like a kinky little air up
with some crumbs in it that's not what
happen but it definitely gives you more
of an like a Italian yaki feel you know
it gives you that but it's not so coarse
it definitely has a bit of a
straightness to it which I can
appreciate how all of my bundles came
and paper like such and then this one
says Brazilian 7 8 16 which was the
length of my closure which is 16 inches
so um both of them together I feel like
it really works so what I'll do is I'll
take one of these out so you guys can
see how it looks without a braid um it's
very full and it's just very very sick
so as I'm taking this out you'll see so
this is what it looks like out of the
braid and via this can definitely go
from my hair for sure this is no
different than um like I said the
Italian Yankee now what I will say is
duce this hair smelled very funky when I
got it and I don't know what they put in
in what the process what chemical it
wasn't they used to do this but it was a
lot it was
pungent is a understatement okay now
i'ma need these companies to kind of get
it together with smells because it's
about the fourth week go forthwith
before the wake I've made from either
left in hair or just a wig I received
and it was just really is smelled really
bad I don't know if you guys have to
just air this out after you process it
are wet but I don't think nobody wants
funky muggles so I just went ahead and
wash them and use some fabric softener
and of course they got the smell out it
didn't change the hair texture at all
but again that's just not something that
smells the greatest when you know you
have to put it in your head and it
smells really really bad so the hair has
very minimal shedding um the luster to
this is very nice it looks very natural
now I did earlier I don't know what
what's going on over there but I'm not
feeling it now my grade for this i'ma
tell you off the top I will give this
hair and nice a - and the - only because
it was stinky like nobody wants thanking
hair but it does look like I'm out to
get my hair done you know I'm saying
this definitely has a very natural
texture to it so this is really more for
my natural girls or the people who want
just something in-between you're not
really a big fan of the super silky hair
you want something that kind of mimics
your hair a little bit better this is
actually a great candidate um I did
construct this week however you could um
I believe they do so wigs in this
texture like for lace wigs but I
definitely did construct this um you can
see my you can go to my channel and you
can look for how to make a wig tutorial
and I did the same exact thing the only
difference with this hair is I did not
cut my bundles off with this I just
folded them over and normally I with
curly hair and stuff like that you
usually can cut them because you're not
really gonna see a big difference like
it's gonna leg but it's still gonna be
thick like this usually I'll cut out my
straight hair or a little bit of a wave
because I want my hair to look um as
flat as possible because that's how it's
gonna lay but because this is thicker
it'll lay down flat but it doesn't have
to be cray
she flat you know so I'll take this side
out so you see what it looks like
completely with a new breed oh so let me
tell you okay so what I was attempting
to do on this hair that I was gonna
originally do it I was going to like put
it in some real like take my wand
as you does what inside is wavy um I was
gonna take my want and like put some
nice ringlet waves in it and then brush
it out okay I started this piece and
then this didn't want to act right so I
opted to do the braids instead so yeah
this is what it looks like please so
yeah this is what I was gonna do but
they're not even work out so it
definitely has a lot of texture to it it
definitely gives you african-american
the only thing that I will say that is a
little bit different and some kind of
like I don't like is that it does look
like crimps right here so you have to
take which I don't have a comb nearby
but you have to take a comb and like
brush through this or comb through this
to get it to look a little bit more like
this so I'll remember that because if
you just wear it this is like from a
fresh wash and it was air dried I didn't
blow dry it but it will look like this
all the like I took some crimson crimped
my hair which was not the idea at all
but overall sick should have um I will
definitely give you guys like I said in
a - and only you get the - because of
the smell
I had no shedding and bleach like a
drink now I'm I wanna bleach the taste
out of this hair just to keep it in its
natural state but I would like for it to
be like a blue at the ends I think that
would be like a very cute option um but
I'm a little bit scared because I know
it's um some type of chemical in it
because the way it smell when I received
it and then on top of that um bleach
just isn't always your best friend oh if
you guys are interested in this hell
they make sure you guys click the links
below and let me know what you think
what you think my next look should be
what do you think I should do with this
hair you know like I had it in a braids
so now what else this will be really
good
somebody who could braid to make you a
box braid wig this would be the perfect
material so let me know what you guys
think okay /</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
