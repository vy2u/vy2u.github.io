tad bit different than I'm used to I'm
going to actually review just a frontal
now this front suit is from a company of
course it's Aliexpress and it's called
charming hair and originally you guys
know what I do hair reviews is either
through me or my manager and usually
when I do these reviews people usually a
request hair and actually do I want a
frontal or a culture
so usually him or I will go back and
forth until we figure out you know what
works and for the longest time I have
had this frontal and I'm like okay so
I'll eventually install the hair but I
put the frontal on and then I'm kind of
like and then it hit me up and was like
it's been awhile you know when it's the
video gonna be up in my manager was like
well is this in your appointment book
and I'm like yeah but it's not supposed
to be right now because I don't have any
hair well apparently I just wanted to
review for just the frontal so this is
this is as you can see there was
supposed to be hair that he went here
for this wig but I just there yeah so
this is they're still based frontal who
loose wave so this is the original
texture of it so I went ahead and
plucked the hair line on this have not
however cut the cap out so we're gonna
push that back so you can actually see
what it looks like after it's been pour
this is what it looks like around the
hairline I have I did not bleach the
knots on this because it is a silk base
however one thing that I've noticed
about having still based front tools is
that usually when there's some basis
they only are silk based from about this
section so all of this is still laced
and all of this is still laced so you
can only really part it to get that
natural still base look if you party
pretty much down the middle
because the thing is like with it we
know I still face closure the closure is
gonna be probably about just here so if
it's just here and I want a side part
but I still want it to be a sub base
side part I just shift the weight to the
side and then the closure will be over
here because these go ear to ear if you
try to shift it it's just gonna fit your
head kind of funny so that really
doesn't work so I've yet together and
it's not just this company it's every
company I've yet to get a frontal that
actually is so based from ear to ear now
when somebody got one of those I let me
okay show you what I mean I'm gonna part
it down so as you can see here this
looks very real this is like a very real
scalp now if I go ahead and part it on
the side you got a notice that it's not
brown anymore it's just a whole bunch of
dots okay so we're gonna compare that to
that so that's what I've noticed and
it's just again not this company is
pretty much every company from
Aliexpress or not even Aliexpress I have
a frontal from I had some like some wavy
hair and that was the first time I had
ever really had like a real frontal and
it was a silk base and I felt a little
more comfortable because I'm like okay I
don't know how to work a sub base versus
lace which I will say I like lace
frontals more than I like lace closures
okay
so let's keep that real I do like lace
frontals more than I like lace closures
I wanna record and say that hopefully
somebody can change my mind but right
now this one this particular frontal had
already been sewn all the way around
because I had a planning on installing
some hair so what I'll do because I've
already started this and they plan to
not send me any hair and it was no
prison for no specific reason they just
have never intended to send me hair
which I was the hair the thing when
you're corresponding back and forth from
China or places where your first
language is their second language a lot
of times things get a little muddled and
you just don't know what is what so
that's why it was a little bit confused
I have yet to wear this film I have yet
to wear this so I really can't tell you
how great it is because I have not
worried but judging by the hair texture
I really do like it if I have some hair
to match this I would use it I believe I
have some hair but it may be a little
tighter than this so this is more of a
loose way and that is more of a like a
kinky way or more like of a tight wave
or curl really so this I would the only
option and this is another thing that I
really don't like is that the roots a
lot of times you see how straight these
roots are this is using what I get so I
usually have to go in and wand this out
when I get why because the way that the
hair is put into this is not the first
frontal or first closure I've had where
the roots are a little bit on the
straight side and you can just simply
fix that with using the wand now um
there is a soap base and when I was
plucking there were but there were baby
hairs around the front of this that I
just brushed pretty much with in here
but I will say that when I separated the
baby here from it you can see the line
of where the silk base is and where the
line of the so base is there is there's
a whole bunch of hair that's plucked the
right on that line of the Sylve so so
you can see you see that long line right
here so you see this line right here
that's the line that I'm talking about
and that's where pretty much the where
the lace stops and the silk top arm
starts now a lot of people in the beauty
community call that pretty much the line
of death when it comes to silk based
anything because the problem of people
have which I never do is blending the
silk base to match your hair the thing
about lace is lace is all one continuous
medium so once you go ahead and you take
the lace and you party it parts all the
way to the back the silk top you
he stops at a point and then you have to
go ahead and figure out how you're gonna
blend that line of demarcation and
that's pretty much what that is but if
you plan on wearing this up or you just
plan on wearing this and then like a
curly style you guys know recently I
call it my lowdown dirty gem here but I
had it up like such and I went ahead and
had the rest of the hair down in the
back this would be perfect because this
the hairs that are plucked in the
perimeter part of it actually are
plucked in very nicely so there is no we
have to kind of press it out that
sometimes we have to press it out we
have to flat iron it out it takes the
texture out of the rest of hair so you
have these straight roots which if you
really would put your hair in a ponytail
they would be straight any way you want
it more so of a kind of loose top knot
and you just wanted it to be like such
then this actually would be very perfect
um I believe the length of this is 14
inches which is actually pretty nice I
prefer mice to be a little bit on the
longer side so 16 would be the shortest
I would go for something like this
especially plan will having like medium
length to long hair in the back I would
definitely consider a little bit longer
but just judging by this and I haven't
did anything to this but cohosh it and
this is the natural texture that it is
so if you guys are looking for from some
frontals especially some silk based
frontals or some lace frontals check out
Charming here I can't really say much
about the way that I would get out of
this particular frontal because again I
haven't had time or a chance to wear it
or have any hair to it matches it so
that's unfortunate but I'll definitely
find use for this I'll probably just go
ahead and straighten it and use it for
one of my straight units um that I have
laying around on some hair that I'm
gonna redo that was probably originally
a closure that I want a frontal for now
so I'll keep the link for this below if
you guys have any questions about this
particular frontal then make sure you
guys put them below I will definitely be
showing you guys how it went ahead and
pluck this hairline um and go ahead and
watch some reviews on them and see if
they may have some hair that you really
like I can't say personally but hey give
it a try
why did you guys in my next one okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
