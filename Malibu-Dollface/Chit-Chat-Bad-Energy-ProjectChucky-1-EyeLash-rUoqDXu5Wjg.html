in the morning um I just came back from
carnival at avalon in hollywood i
performed with my friend Donna glitch um
per single Suresh and I don't know why
because I'm just deathly tired I wanted
to make a vlog I have no clue what the
point reason would be right now but
y'all say I don't blog so why not but I
had an amazing time tonight I will say
that it is something about people's
vibes that's why this is gonna be about
vibes and I guess friends and that whole
thing um but I vibe with the person can
definitely make all of the difference in
how you feel um I have been knowing
Donna uh when she was dancing for Sierra
you guys ever seen the UH shriya video
she was the main girl if you ever seen
Cole or she's the gross finish out Chris
Brown's first video for um what I forgot
what his first single was but the girl
in the video um run it she was the main
girl um I've been known her for like we
realized today we known each other for
like seven years and she asked me like
he'd be part of this and you guys know
how to do not perform I am NOT that you
know that person but she was like I
think he'll you know you'll your kill it
and we went and had an amazing time and
all the girls welcome me with open arms
and they've been dance with each other
for years and they I feel like they're
they're like my sisters now you know
legis it's a dope feeling but um I've
been in rehearsals for week it was a
week straight that I have been in his
briefs rehearsals and I'm tired my neck
hurts mom and I had a small pardon girls
were dancing hard at a small last part
but
on the vibe of everything was never like
this can't happen everybody's always
been positive and he was always you know
this and known her for so long I could
never say no to somebody who's always
been we've been on chosen to myspace
days I'll carry but if you are around
people and they have very negative vibes
and they're very just the the terrible
spirit is going to tear you down because
eventually if the person is out in the
rain acting ignorant you're going to
want to run out there and to just to say
that you did it and you can be part of
it too you know that type of thing so um
yeah I'm backed up like a mother on hair
reviews of this hair that i have in
right now which is still kicking after
stuff i put this here in like earlier
today like this morning and it's just
now starting to fall but this is my
princess hair shop aqua blue hair that i
just updated not too long ago but this
is that same here to st. my closure dog
my closure and if it's not about that
life it's definitely about bad life like
what what closure the one closure white
closure this is definitely my sub base
closure that I colored from closed or my
lipstick is hot core from Mac my eyelash
you guys notice I missed an eyelash it
came off on my way to the car oh I'm
tired I've dumped some immature on my
way home broken things broken is coming
back but she's been in London for a
minute now my hands are dirty um I just
wanted to come and say howdy y'all and I
don't blog or vlog whatever the is
called
but yeah I got a lot of think I'm gonna
do like an update week with all the cuz
i've been telling on that like every two
weeks i'm gonna update my hair indian
and three weeks come and go and then i
still ain't updated that's because
I just like the hair reviews are getting
kind of out of hand as far as the amount
of people who want me to work with them
and a lot of companies that I do work
with so it is I don't really have time
to update if there was ever something
wrong I've always come back and be like
look my hair shed it and it was a good
problem but no haven't had that with any
of my or any of my wigs but I think I'm
gonna do like I just a week or we can
have I'm just update videos for wigs
that in weaves that I've already um
reviewed and you guys not have project
Chucky coming which I'm making my own
good guy doll which is really fun I know
