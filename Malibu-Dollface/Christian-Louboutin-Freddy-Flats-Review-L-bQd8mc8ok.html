sock mark on my ankle yeah these are
very very very comfortable they look
beautiful in the light if you're not a
person that likes to wear a lot of
boring dress shoes these are perfect if
you want to stand out these would be
great and oh yeah
I'm in love one of my favorite pairs
ever literally do a review and I'm start
doing this a lot off because you guys
know how to do these shoe halls but I
don't usually do reviews on shoes really
but I seen a lot of people do it so so
I'm gonna do a review on some Louboutins
and these are my Freddy flats and these
are some of my favorite shoes ever one
thing that I hate about Louboutin is his
sneakers one thing I love about
Louboutin is his Oxford's as well as I
like his um I like it's okay but I wear
him so no matter to me but they are
really nice shoes so I'm going to do a
review on these bad boys and you guys
know if you haven't um check the links
below
I did a shoe home and I mentioned two
pairs of my Freddy flats that I have in
there um and I'm going to show you guys
like I'm gonna compare two bottoms too
cuz it's like a little ongoing fight I
don't have my friend about but we're
gonna okay so these were really cuz you
guys know that I love but I love
obviously giuseppe's just every doesn't
make does never seen you but I love the
Louboutins
Oxford's like nobody's business so this
is what they look like and they have
like this stone I'm it's the opposite of
what it is and then this is like a suede
and then they have the gold um the nice
gold spikes and then of course the
classic Louboutin bottoms um if
anybody's wondering in a seven and women
in American I were thirty nine and a
half in women in these so if you
sighs me this would be your size the
reason the conversion rate because
technically that would be a nine because
anything in European sizes for women
usually if it's a 30/70 shoe you usually
wear a seven however that's not true
because European shoes are way smaller
than American shoes so if anybody told
you to head nigga how you buy the wrong
size and your feet go hurt any of your
corns so no um but these are them I
freaking up and they have these other
taupe ones I'm gonna put them right here
and those too but I gotta find him in my
size um the one thing I love about these
is that no matter how big your feet are
they make them look really tiny um which
I love because I did on New Year's I
wore my giuseppe's and they are like
glittery but because they are like a
loafer and they have like I'll put them
here they have like this thick platform
to them so I made my feet look a little
bigger than our or like too but these so
yeah so back to when I was talking about
earlier which is the sole so you guys
know Louboutin is known for his classic
soles and the red bottom is you know the
staple you buy them for this now I own
two other pair of these good ol Oxford's
on the Freddy flags and white which you
probably can't see that well because of
this but they are white and spiked and
this is what the bottom looks like after
I walked in these I wore my birthday I
think I would ease like a total of three
times these is what the bottom look like
and it's not bad or whatever but this is
not really attractive compared to this
this is not really attractive when all
is said and done and then I have the I
have the black ones um as well and I
can't me just be a little back story on
me so I have went on a date and my date
didn't tell me after dinner we were
gonna go to mahal and drive and walk up
a hill and he offered to carry me on his
back but bitch wasn't charlie
so the bottom of my shoes now look like
and that is ugly okay there's not
attractive however um you guys know you
can take this to a clobber and a climber
can actually put these nice little grips
on the bottom of your shoes and it will
stop there you can do them with these
two if they already jacked a big one
just shave this down and then they're
gonna go ahead and um put these like a
nice rubber soles on them so that they
they won't get messed up the shoe itself
there's nothing wrong with it they look
brand-new both of these and inside like
they've never been worn they still have
the dust bags and all that you know cuz
I don't wear the shoes that often but
you guys know between these three pairs
of shoes I will never need to buy dress
shoes ever again but I am but yeah these
are some of the most gorgeous shoes I've
ever owned in my life and again
Louboutin is good for a lot of things
you guys know I love just at me for my
shoes and my sneakers are pretty much
augers I've got thing I own like two
pairs of Louboutins sneakers but they're
all these I will always go for him for
some nice pretty flats because they're
very comfortable they're very easy to
wear the only thing that I don't like is
that once you wear them the bottoms are
no they're red they just go to over it
that little boost it um and they're very
slippery so you kind of James Brown it
up and a pair of these when all is said
and done but I really do like these and
I know a lot of you guys especially a
lot of our chicks a lot of y'all be like
what kiss some cute shoes you could wear
that are not heels cuz a lot of you guys
be like I love my heels but sometimes
I'm not in the mood
these are so cute with a skirt if you
wear these any of these colors I'll wear
these with the cute skirt I had to shoot
something recently and I had to wear a
skirt and I wore these instead of
wearing up here hills um so yeah I
thought these were like the best
Christmas gift ever
besides Ritchie oh these were great and
I know a lot of times you guys ask me to
do a review
and how do I feel and as you guys see I
have not were these yet and I think I'm
gonna go as a clubber in Brentwood and
I'm gonna go ahead and have these capped
at the bottom so they just are not
ruined because I just hate to see and
some people feel like if you scuff them
up at the bottom a whole lot then you
know you get your money's worth um so it
just depends on the person but let me
just make a poll real quick
would you prefer your bottoms to look
like this or would you prefer them to
look like that it's the bottom of the
shoe so it's really up to you so let me
know if you guys enjoyed this make sure
you guys thumbs up this video I'm gonna
act like a rhythm on YouTube right now
make sure you guys thumbs the video and
then you share a new light with your
friends and I'll do more videos like
this in the future so yeah it's weird
so anyway um oh the price point I'm
sorry guys gonna act my black ones I got
on sale from Eamon's
and I think I got them one so for like
five something and that's because I only
have my left
um my white ones Oh were the regular
price whatever like 1200 and these were
for Neiman Marcus but the price isn't on
here
but because I didn't pay for them no but
yeah they they range but I will say they
are very comfortable they are very
stylish they definitely are showstoppers
so if you guys are looking for really
nice casual shoes and you don't want to
wear your church shoes I would
definitely look in system live with Tom
Freddie flats and I'll come with more
stuff more sneakers you guys know I love
my sneakers than you guys know I'm a
ninja that'd be good no but I'll come
for more reviews than halls and stuff
for more shoes and I will talk to you
guys have been mixed water</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
