the wig that I'm wearing which is from
classic lace wigs and this is a color
number - 22 inches and it is light yaki
I want to say I think the the hair
texture is Indian if I'm not mistaken or
Remy I'm not for sure but I'll put it in
the bottom description I really don't
remember but this is very reminiscent to
a wig that I also reviewed I've been
wearing in our review before the only
difference is the color is different as
you can see this is more of a brown
which I don't remember asking for a
brown but I do like it it's not bad at
all I just did a tutorial on how to cut
layers so that's where these layers came
from they did not come in the wig and it
is a silk top as you can see it is a
little it's it matches my sculpt a
little bit more stuff it's not perfect
but it does match a little bit more than
my other one did um it came with a wig
liner which I don't understand why they
send these because they only thing that
they do is they just play where the lace
is because I always leave a little bit
of lace in the front it just shows
through so you know I don't know they
sent it through UPS this time nothing
Joe ups it did come from China and they
sent me this contraption that I've later
found out cuz I don't reach my knee that
is the wig stand um I didn't open it cuz
I don't plan on using it although I
could probably use it as like a hat a
hat stand and then I got the wig it came
with this of course folded in the middle
and it came in this plastic um and had a
net which I have not a clue where it is
but it came with you know the classic
nets that they give you on pretty much
any lace wig when you buy it or any wig
for that matter um this is a light yaki
and I like the yaki texture because it
does mimic african-american hair pretty
darn well
say that I do like that it has combs in
the back it has two combs right here or
comb in the back and I think it's one
right here but I could be wrong but I
know it's no it's not one right here is
only one right here and two in the back
it does it didn't come with lace in the
back at all and this was the lace that I
cut off that was from the front
perimeter area that was here um it's a
little fuller than the other one because
it's probably not as long it's not as
long it's only 22 instead of 24 but it
does feel a little bit fuller and this
one could stand a little a couple of
trucks too but it's not horrible unison
like I said it's not a horrible weight
because it is full and for them for the
average person this will be perfect
I will I can't lie this will be pretty
perfect as far as the thickness goes I
will say that I don't like the fact that
this little piece right here there is I
don't know if it's my braids or what but
it just will not lay down but it could
just be the fact that the wigs news so
and I just took it out the package like
an hour ago so you know if this laid
like this you know I would be a very
happy camper but it isn't um so that's
probably the only thing that I don't
like about it but I haven't got any
shedding when I cut it it cut perfectly
like I it was great this is how long it
comes well this is how long it is on me
as you can see which is not very long
but you know it's pretty long this is
I'm not I'm not a short hair person like
I would never do a bob unless it was a
wig you know which I think I might do
you know I'll do like Beyonce's bob
maybe I should do that with a wig
but I do like the fact that it's
lightweight it's easy to put on it's not
a hassle and people keep asking like
what do you do like you put clips inity
you know what are you like it's snug
like it's not gonna go anywhere like it
feel like a sock that's like the best
example I could give if I need to return
some socks a matter of fact but it do
feel like a sock
like you know your sock just they grab
your foot not a loose sock a good brand
new sock that's how it feels it doesn't
go anywhere it's not gonna move or
anything you know you could put clips in
it if you want to or some combs or I
don't know if it'd make you feel a
little bit better but I don't think it's
necessary you know I think that's the
whole thing like I don't think it's
necessary for this particular one
because it don't move at all so yeah I
would buy it personally I do really like
this wig it's not as inexpensive as well
the light yaki does help mimic a lot of
different hair textures so it does help
you know it's flowy it moves um I mean
that's the best I could come up with at
this particular point cuz there's
nothing a bad to say about it you know
y'all know if it was bad I would tell
y'all like let me tell you something
real quick like but no it's not bad at
all it's it's it's full enough for the
average person if you do like a lot of
hair you might want to add some drugs
but it's it has a lot of body and moves
easy breezy beautiful and I'm sure I did
Co I in the reason why I did it is
because I had um spilt some of my
coconut oil it was in like it was on the
dresser and it spilled over and a wig
was born the dressers do cuz I was
cutting the lace off so I did have to
cohosh it to get it out while I washed
that particular part but the rest of it
so I didn't blow dry it so this actually
is not how it originally came but it
didn't shed at all that's what I love
like he didn't shed it didn't get
brittle and softer then it probably was
when I first got it um which is great
because that means that it's gonna last
just a time it's not gonna be one of
those wigs that you get in the package
and they're nice and you wear once and
then it just goes to hell you don't want
that you don't want to spend your money
on something like that so this I would
definitely recommend because it's the
perfect Lane there's somebody most
people go for about eighteen money you
know I go for about a twenty-eight so if
you are somebody who wants a little more
length in your used to this would be
perfect especially for me
this is like that get up and go run down
the street type
so if you have any questions let me know
my cap size my cap color is a medium
brown it's not a light brown because the
light brown would be probably it might
actually be great if I try imma try a
light brown but right now it's they've
been sending me mediums medium Browns or
whatever from these companies so yeah
the only hang-up is this little piece
right here and honestly could be because
my braids are old so it could just be
the fact that it doesn't want to lay
down but I'm almost certain it's simple
fact that the wig is new so when you
have newer wigs this is kind of what
they do know some other than that though
it's perfect love it
no hang-ups but that one so yeah let me
know it is again it's a silk top it's a
four by four as well so it does have the
form of this way in that way so check
the link below and if you guys want to
save on the wig itself when you get
ready to purchase email them and their
email is on their website and tell them
that you watched this particular video
and they'll give you anywhere between
five and twenty dollars and discounts so
I'm just emailing them and let them know
that he watched multiple dogface r
dogface Barbie's videos and you can save
on this wig or any other wig for that
matter on the site and I will talk to
y'all later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
