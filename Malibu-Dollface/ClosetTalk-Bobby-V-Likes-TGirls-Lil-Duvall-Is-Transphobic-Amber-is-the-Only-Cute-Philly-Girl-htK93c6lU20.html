talk so yeah we should it's a lot going
on and I did the video already but I had
to redo it because a lot has happened in
the last 24 hours people so we're going
to start with bobby valentino so if you
guys don't know the slow down singer
Bobby Z who was actually shorter than me
and Bobby you guys wouldn't let me know
that I'm pretty goddamn sure I'm 5 foot
4 so I'm pretty little but he I've met
him before and he comes to like here so
he like 411 I don't know but he was he
solicited a trans girl on Backpage and
if you don't know what back pages is
where all you know the man the women the
trans girls the non-binary they all go
to sell the wolf and whoever want some
for you know a small donation can um you
know get some so he solicited this girl
and he didn't pay her so she's going to
find herself to record his ass hiding
behind his pants I we can't see you
looking like a goddamn ground hogs day
fucking muskrat behind them damn pants
and then he gets and then she left and
she still record in doc Bobby B yo Bobby
Z but you forgot your shoes and your
keys call me when you're done I'm
linking getting back so she decides to
put it out there so families the blog
which is a very viable safe a Melissa's
don't really post if ever anything
that's not true industry on Blairs the
other hand they do and they're the ones
who actually posted it first so a lot of
people were saying this is our trans
girls get killed they trying to put
people out there maybe he didn't know
maybe he tricked her I mean she tricked
him let me explain something to y'all we
just don't get how the world is today
dressed like this I get hit on by men
okay and they are very aware of what
goes on between my legs and I'm not even
trying okay I'm just a little gay boy
who could
princess under some points this is what
they're into he's purposely what on
Backpage went to that section because he
was looking for something in particular
and based on his stature he probably was
bent over like a good ol just a big old
woman so my whole thing is you know
although I feel like exposing somebody
ain't never really got you don't wear so
I guess and then just bitch tapa she
made a fan page you know so when you do
when girls do stuff like that and then
they start to fill them so far
you know I my life is good girl ain't
nobody give a fuck first and foremost it
was bought Valentino you didn't do it to
jay-z you didn't do it to nobody with
any clout the last hit that Bobby had I
think I was still in high school okay so
therefore no okay so I don't she spilled
herself because it's like today nobody
cares okay which brings me to my next
subject which is a little too long now I
personally am NOT a fan of little Duval
I remember him being on comment view and
I said I watch this little boy with
these big-ass clothes on he handles like
the short pants when a longest supper
they stopped like shy of the ankle but
he did an interview calling genic mosk
who had just appeared on The Breakfast
Club a nigga bitch you in all types of F
not because it was a hypothetical
question about what would you do if you
was having a girlfriend for the last six
months and then it came out that she was
really she used to be a man he made
saying or she gonna have to die now a
lot of people say well he just said his
opinion and you know it was a joke he's
a comedian but the thing is everybody
doesn't find all jokes funny and that's
why we have this thing called a respect
level we have this thing called a limit
because the limit can be reached
depending on who is who and I love what
a lot of people don't understand is that
there are women especially in the trans
community who are being killed by an
alarming rate like it's ridiculous so
for him to say that in a jokey manner is
not funny you get on saying like this is
not funny just like somebody said well
Bill Cosby that bitch it's not funny
because yeah you but I know it's a
little too soon so people were upset
about what he said which made the most
sense because you have a program that's
for the urban community which is usually
the urban community is built up of a
group of minorities and minorities are
the main people who have been through
the most adversity when it comes to
being not treated equally so you have a
woman like Jenny ma who is trying to
make sure that the trans community is
seen as people not as objects and you
have her on your show she makes a great
point and then you bring this asshole on
your show because Charlemagne is trying
to be cool with his friends who clearly
can't get booked anywhere instead of his
fucking bucks up Georgia where nobody is
and he makes this in order to get his
name in the news and then you say very
derogatory things that not everybody
found to be rude and disrespectful some
people found it funny other people
didn't but you have to understand is
that we all gay trans black-white
there's still a group of us and they're
more more so than other but there's a
group of us who have been through a lot
of shit but we felt slighted by people
who look at us a certain way because of
who we are as an individual but the
problem that I have with this is that
people are going to say that it's okay
until it's them nobody gives a fuck
until it's them when your feelings are
hurt you want the world to stop when
it's somebody else then it was funny
just like when I tell people you have to
be careful about how you talk to people
because at the end of the day no matter
what you feel about them that still
someone's child and if you have a child
you have a cousin if you have a brother
and somebody says something out of line
and because of who they are rather be
their sexual orientation their size
their color their race that's offensive
to a group of people so you can't sit up
here and say well people these trans
bitches need to just get the fuck over
it it was a joke and you're going to be
part of this world it was a joke and I
always use as an example because it
still stands true and you have a person
who's a minority and somebody calls you
a nigga bitch and you don't like that
you better remember that's how the fuck
they feel but at hate speech
well that's considered hate speech and
somebody's eyes too so that's why it's
just best not to say it because it can
turn around and be a really big issue so
I personally don't say certain shit
because I don't want nobody talking
or my granny or my sisters like that
that is a common thing but people find
we look because here's the thing let me
just keep it real which are gay people
trans people anybody who isn't straight
we're the freaks
we're the ones where the outsiders we
have something wrong with us that we
have a mental imbalance something is
clinically wrong with us it says in the
Bible is all of these things to try to
justify someone's hate for a group of
people and my problem with this is
simply say you don't like us simply say
you don't fuck with us simply say what
you do I don't fuck with don't use all
of these excuses in order to perpetuate
the hate that you have for a group of
people that you really don't understand
and you don't know and you want to sit
on that you claim to be so real and you
claim to be just say that's how you feel
I don't think that trans women are women
I don't feel like disadvantaged because
I'll say it with equipment I still turn
aways about certain things but at the
same time everything that I personally
feel doesn't need to be said because
what I don't want to do is alienate or
make a group people feel as if they
don't matter because of my personals let
everything that I feel I don't say I
have a lot of strong feelings about
certain things but I know those feelings
can trigger some people who may
necessarily feel away and that's I'm not
my intention is not to disrespect a
group of people that I may not simply
understand that's not my point because I
know how that feels so I'm just simply
not going to do it people don't have
empathy for no one but they want
sympathy from everybody when it's them
you can't you can't you have you can't
pick and choose when to be nice and not
to be nice or because this group of
people doesn't look like me didn't fuck
y'all but when it's me I want all y'all
I want all the trainings all the faggots
all the black ones to come to March with
us because we want to have within you do
this so that's why there's such a big
divide in the black community and the
gay community because this is what we do
is we have people sprouting off at the
mouth shit like that so when people
actually it seems like you're very hard
on the black community I don't
understand why or black lips well I'm
black my mother is black my sisters are
black remember these are black so
speaking from a point of view
of where I've looked at women I look up
to them only to be let down by them you
get what I'm saying so I'm only speaking
from I can't tell you about how it is in
Asian culture because I'm not Asian so
I'm like a lot of motherfuckers on the
internet I simply don't speak from a
point of view that I've never been I'm
not going to tell you what I should've
did or how it is other I don't do that
you give it a pen so I I stick to myself
and give you my I don't talk about shit
on this channel that I never went
through unless I say unless maybe then
you know I'm speaking from a sort of
kind of way but most of the time I speak
my truth on what I know and I'm being
what I'm saying is not not the truth
I'm sure about ten of y'all can agree
with I'm saying right now so that was an
issue people are saying oh well she
should know back to the Bible you know
for sure when she shouldn't put bound
valentino this is how people you know
get killed and how these transcripts let
me tell you them whether you're trans
baka white cat man dog if I contract you
for a service and I don't get my money
for the service we got two options even
we can find it out or I beat the shit
out of you
so I also might possibly be going to
beautycon I'm going to see if I really
want to go but if I do go I'll let you
guys know if I would love to meet a lot
of you guys there as you guys I was
going to do to start doing more many
degrees because I meet a lot of you guys
out in everyday life but beautycon is
August something so I'm going to see I
got an email about it so I'm going to
see if I want to go but if I go I
definitely will let you guys know
so Amber Rose have made some not-so-nice
claims pretty much she did an interview
saying that because she was pretty
growing up she got treated a certain way
and a lot of people took what she said
completely wrong and I get what she was
saying before delivery was absolutely
terribly stupid and then on top of that
we've seen pictures of ever Rose when
she was a kid and she was not the cutest
let's just say that so I like Amber
I love the slut walk I understand that
but when all is said and done I feel
like in the last year and a half two
years every latitude has definitely
turned me off of her like I'm right to
really like her and now she just gives
me a very
entitlement like I'm pretty I'm a
stripper I do this to SlutWalk
girls when it like you know I'm saying
like that's my whole thing I think like
she speaks a little bit too much and it
don't serve a great purpose for her
sometimes shutting the fuck up is like
the best fucking thing you could ever
fucking do just shut the fuck up so I
just think like I get like we all I
think because people want to say people
I sell sensitive today they are because
I say a lot of things that people take
the wrong way but I think is you have to
be smart about what you say too because
you are conveying this to a group of
people who are going to misinterpret it
in about 50 different ways and there are
most people who just don't like you
that's probably gonna be under this
video to have something negative to say
just because of the fact that they don't
like you that you can say everything
right they're gonna still find something
wrong but I feel like if she has a
legion of people kind of looking up to
her and she is considered a celebrity
now although the word celebrity is just
is so distorted bleh she should watch
her mouth that's all she's just watch
what the fuck she said well not even
watching how she say she cuz you can get
your point across without coming off
like you know I was the baddest bitch in
Philly and then my girls like I was
really like dad in our legs
not with those waterfalls she had grotto
now I'm sure they were popping for that
time girl but we've seen amber she was
ugly duckling and she turned into the
Amber Rose and not to say we all have
had those moments but it's like she's
trying to make herself I would be like
I've been bad all my life I was like the
other thing has been pretty all her life
I've never seen a picture beyond saying
when she yeah yeah yeah but her actual
like being as an individual she doesn't
look any different she grew up like
Kelly was funny looking and I think it's
because of her because she had those
braces or maybe but even the toil is
well you're lucky she still looks the
same without you to you know so there
are certain people who have been
beautiful all their life and then there
are people who get older and they start
to understand what contour and highlight
am in and they start to understand how
certain things look on them and that's
what that's what Amber was but that's
ninety percent of America she's trying
to make it seem like I was in a blender
bitches just couldn't they couldn't take
me and I'm right
so Kevin Hart's ex-wife had a lot to say
she's a bitch before
after the surgery justinian you know so
is amber just watch what the fuck you
say baby girl just watch what the fuck
you say so
Fox Doodle Brown boogie Brown chick
decided to put up a video and Moschino
rapping to a song as it was a diss about
Remy Ma but she didn't know the words
and she looked like she was high on
something some bath salts and everybody
clown her for I sure enough fun because
I'm like I don't understand why the fuck
she decided to do like I'm gonna cares
the last time I think boxy Brown she
looked like grow that we was as dry as
the Mojave Desert that outfit was his
brown as a diary to stricken child and
though that and I'm not one for weight
shame in nobody but we remember what Fox
used to look like and we remember what
she looked like now and you shouldn't
wear certain things when your body is
not summertime ready okay if the body
summertime sadness we're going to put a
serrano something or girlfriend but we
not going to do that though so I'll time
left so I'm just going to kind of give
you my opinions about this season of
Love &amp;amp; Hip Hop so far I love Masika you
guys know I love me some Missy game when
I was with my reviews you guys know I
sort of I didn't like her very much I
didn't know her so I didn't like her by
the end of the season she was legit my
favorite person ever because she's so
ignorant she's my type of ignorant but
hazel and net weave I can't
and this I'm doing this I'm doing my
Richard scam artists Erica no I like I
like hazel
snoo knows I'm not really caring too
much for her wrong body like I hate I
don't know what it is now it seems like
when girls get surgery done they get it
done but the body looks like they just
wrapped a pig in a blanket and sold it
up and then they gonna put a waist
trainer so your stomach is flat but it's
still bits no definition like your body
fat is still what it was before the
surgery but it's just flat
now so you still fat you're just
flattened fat so you just look like
Missy in the rain video with the that's
what she given me tear or two um the new
Alexis guy I just feel like why would
you come on a show for with a dudes baby
mama that you used to fuck with and you
try to pee pretty much piggyback off of
her like regardless of how you thought
about Masika she still has been there
since season 1 unless is however it's
only on the show because of their
dealings with Fetty WAP and that's why
she wanted to be on the show okay I
won't be talking about lyrica in a one
just because I know that why used to
know them and I don't a girl no I'm not
even waste my time on that fake shit but
twelve Moniz alimonies she's ignorant
just like I am so I love her Nia of
course I love Zell flag the salads like
Ray said in green he is greasy and dirty
and he go he is dead he is giving you
skid row tease if you from LA you know
that's where all the bums kickin and he
looks like he had made a little
departure toe money and I feel in
himself
um he is the type of person that I hate
going out because when I see people like
that I'm like you don't even have a
melon address and you're talking about
how lit you are yes honey you are lit on
an unemployment line bitch lit I don't
know this season just seems like it's
going to be very interesting and it
seems like some of the best season thus
far from the previews so we shall see
what happens but make sure you guys
