been gone for a minute I was back with
the mess anyway so I came to talk about
some current events that are going on
because we haven't been able to to kick
it in and have one of these little
powwows and y'all keep asking me my
opinion about a lot of stuff that's
going on right now in the media and
holding chuckle you know so the first
thing that i want to talk about is nicki
minaj's her paper magazine cover and how
i don't have a problem with it like
people were shocked because you guys
know I've had my bouts with Nicki in the
past okay I've had my issues with her
I've had my feelings about her but I can
say that like we've seen more of Nicki
in this situation like in a Halloween
costume okay we've seen a lot more I
feel or close to it and um and akanda we
see more her in anaconda
unum stand her down wax figure got more
showing than that that you know usually
in paper magazine everybody let it all
hang out okay we know Kim did it um who
is the dude this little stunt Queen um
Christopher Milan from loving here by
that is whole dick and ass out for the
pride issue during Pride Month so it
wasn't like you guys have to understand
that this is a magazine that does this
on purpose you get what I'm saying
celebrities do paper magazine to make a
statement to get y'all to talk and
that's exactly what it was however comma
I thought it was quite convenient that
this magazine cover came out right when
her brother got convicted of all the
stuff he was convicted of in with the
little girl and stuff so I do feel like
it was strategic ice puck you know
because they wanted to kind of take the
the focus off they probably had already
shot the cover they might shot
today I don't know younam's and it could
have been that week she just like I have
to make this you know situation go away
her brother Jelani you know I feel that
he deserved what he got because those
are children involved and I can't
necessarily say if he in a quarter law I
said he was guilty and now I wouldn't
answer I don't know bitch I read the
same motherfucking shit dijanna crude
and it said that he was guilty so if
that's the case then you know whatever
so again I don't have a problem with it
listen uh y'all know I am a little kim
fanatic and honesty mode in know kim
they're not insane a nikkie so and she
ain't she be paper magazine way back
when okay now the next person that I
want to talk about even though I'm not a
big fan here at all its Meek Mill and
it's because of the fact that meek is
being sentenced to go serve two to four
years for violating his probation or
parole one of the two I don't remember I
don't know listen I got a lot of you who
locked up but I still don't know what
the difference is okay put it down below
so go ahead girl with your little
Webster's haven't asked you my y'all
urban dictionary hoes kill me but anyway
um he violated something he wasn't
supposed to violated and how his ass is
getting locked up and people are are
protesting and you got Rick Ross the
wing stop balls out here talking about
is Ricky Rozay and I feel like my
brother Meek you know should it first
and foremost let me just say this I
understand we all have talked about the
system being crooked or whatever against
the minority men you know and if you
know that this is a situation and you
know that there is a systemic oppression
going on why would you give them time to
keep locking you up you get what I'm
saying like if I know that a bitch gotta
watch his step then why the fuck what I
just keep doing that now I'm hearing all
the judge wanted favors because her
cousin knew somebody girl whatever when
all is said and done he's a convict
he put herself in that position you
should have not violated she's been very
lenient with you and you shouldn't put
yourself in this situation so that's
what you gets maybe next time we'll stop
putting everything on snapchat and
everything
fucking YouTube and everything on
fucking Twitter and just live your life
do nobody wouldn't know you was popping
wheelies on motherfucking motorbikes if
you didn't want to tell everybody in a
motherfucking mama or show everybody to
show everybody how fly you was that
don't work like that so therefore
bye-bye little Mickey I'll see you what
in a couple of years okay any kinda
gonna do that much y'all he probably
gonna do like six months max but you got
people like him protesting in Philly I
was just meeting people with a show they
asked us to vote we would be in a
different predicament okay
he's a rich rapper who has the ability
to get everything handed to him at home
and he still chooses to go out and
violate and not get permission to do
things from situations in which he
started and he did well he did 12 years
and okay well listen here bitch I didn't
know years okay
and I wasn't on your slinging drugs and
rapping about it so therefore we all got
choices get you some so next thing I was
talking about is hey Martin Vince
oh girl be on sale unless somebody
whooped her ass I like the picture but
her hair looks like yarn I'm sorry but
do see that Beyonce what's going on baby
like what's gone that I y'all could do
what y'all gonna do but bitch I came no
no no so um we was all about tomorrow
Vince and they're getting divorce and
then take my momma running her mouth
shoutout to momma ee okay I will never
forget y'all she heard did I was
watching the Braxton filing values and
she was she said something I mean maybe
I don't know this but I'll do when most
black people I don't know who know but
you know people who I don't eat chitlins
my granny cook them for my uncle but I
don't eat chillings
so she was like she said a year for me
somebody who say something with so much
off and you like you really believe that
shit huh you really think you did
something huh she was like you know the
good way to cut the smell for chitlins
lemon juice I was like sig lei but maybe
somebody don't I don't know but the way
she did it was like bitch fuck with me I
am the a connoisseur of everything and
in some I'm just kind of like all right
mama all right girl
so apparently Vince and Tamar have been
going through their personal woes and
they've she decided to file for divorce
and I don't know Taymor personally um
she follows me on Instagram which I
don't understand it so why because I've
never like said that I was a fan of hers
but I got an against her you to get him
saying like funny but I never followed
her so I followed her back because she
followed me um but so will is obsessed
like he is at a Martian he is a groupie
it's really sad every time I see a
picture on Instagram this motherfucker
don't like me like ain't you supposed to
be working ok good show that's the bump
Instagram I get the telling on you ok
I'm sure your motherfucking boss would
like to know which I like it on the
clock
but anyway Oh Tamar said originally the
reason why she would this was gonna be
her last album mm-hmm because she felt
like Vince and her had to get back to
the root of their marriage and that
whole thing and then later wrong we soon
as the the Bluebird of happiness gets
released all of a sudden she's singing
that they're about to get a divorce
then it comes out that the sisters have
said there was things that had happened
you guys know last year he had
apparently tried to take a chunk out of
her up during a scuffle of some sorts
there was apparently a situation that
happened when Toni was there and he put
his hands on tomorrow then there were
people like during the show you like her
mama said something to her brother like
you know everything that glitter and
gold what have you know people talk you
know they always got to get you a little
wisdom with it but you still be confused
as fuck like yeah mama
wait what so she did that whole thing or
whatever so then they said what they
said and then I'm like ok maybe because
you know you could tell like they have
been waiting for this situation to
pretty much happen you know especially
have to take my remember it is hey this
man is a good man yo man can't keep no
job yo man like to cheat on the Internet
yo man a babysitter this man he did for
here good
man he was so good at you know divorce
now I got another guest tomorrow but all
I'm saying is sometime you should learn
to shut the fuck up cuz you could be in
a situation which happened so so as a
recently my last update about everything
that's going on her mom alone a radio
station and said that she had black eyes
she had bruises on her body she kept
ending up in a hospital and it wasn't
just and she has blood clots so I'm
starting to believe that all of the
stuff that kind of led up to her Dancing
with the Stars situation could have been
because her body was so you know back I
like I know people who have been in like
abusive situations and at least still
suffer the repercussions of the
situation because of what had happened
to them and understand like for me I
have like a hairline fracture in my
ribcage and some stuff that happened to
me as a kid so I have to be very careful
because I'm extremely skinny so if
somebody pressed they could look pretty
much break my rib cage
like try to be very careful you know you
have situations that happen and you know
you have to be very careful of what you
do to your body or what you allow other
people to do your body to so if you know
anybody who's like in an abusive
situation or you're in an abusive
situation try your best to try to get
out of that you know in the safest
possible way because there's no really
way to tell somebody how to get you know
you could take all help but the thing
about people who have like Stockholm
Syndrome they feel bad about leaving the
person who's done these things to them
so going back could be the last time if
you do it when you're not ready if that
makes any sense
so moving on to Tyreese cry Rhys ty
Greece so I'm sure we've all we you know
we've all heard about Teresa's drama and
I wanted to wait to do this video
because I wanted to see what the outcome
was gonna be for the court proceedings
with his daughter because I personally
felt like um he's batshit crazy now I've
never said this but my friend is really
good friends with Teresa and she had a
white party if you guys follow me on
Instagram then you'll know exactly what
I'm talking about
and he came to the white party not in
white and he had a very
I don't care I've been meeting
celebrities since I was like 14 I got a
lot of celebrity friends so it didn't
when I see somebody I'm like a girl
whatever about hey hey I know so a lot
of people who are moving like partner
waters for him or whatever and I was
just kind of like okay so I'm standing
like in the kitchen area he was like how
you doing and are you doing he came in
with this very like I am god complex and
I was just kind of like this is so
unattractive like I don't you know I
don't follow him or anything that he
does every time he post something it's
always irritating so when I seen the
drama that was starting to happen with
him and Rach I was like okay and then
okay then he photoshopped his self he
photoshopped his jet cover and put it on
a Forbes cover I don't think nobody was
caught that okay I caught it miss dang
I'm Tyrese is a native of California
we're both from California he's from
Compton as you guys know and he's from
watts actually and what's really funny
is my sister my little sister when she
was in elementary school she went to
school with his sisters I'm not gonna
say their names cuz that's but he had a
little brother that was named up there
like a grocery store and he was bad as
fuck okay like little dude needed some
help and it was day with both you know
tiger easy so for me to see Ruiz come
from and where he is now and it is like
I am God Yoshi
you know Roman Pearce won't be in the
next fast move like dude your character
should have died when the Asian dudes
character died actually you should have
died instead of him because your
character is just a throwaway character
all the thing you do is yell and cut us
that's it we can I could do that I'm
gonna let her girl I could do that look
like Victoria Beckham adjacent why are
you playing so for me I just felt like
everything I was going on then he went
on I just want my baby and I'm gonna
just say tell y'all the Baltimore I just
want my baby remix it's like the best
shit I've ever heard in my life if you
don't know I'll put a link to it below
cuz that shit is poppin okay
when I tell you
so I'm gonna go back a little bit since
we're gonna just make this whole video
like 20 damn minutes cuz it's been a
minute I gotta get out a little trick
cuz it's been a minute okay um we're
gonna talk about back to Halloween about
Kim Kardashian's costume and she was a
Lia from the try game video now this
this is one of those costumes that are
dead is done like to death okay that
Queen of the Damned and then of course
the one-in-a-million look people just
like girl is not even knew no more like
ever I'm not mad at it because it keeps
her legacy alive and again people are
just showing their way with Kim did it
and it wasn't my favorite costume that
she ever did and I thought that her
concept that she whoever created her
alpha did an amazing job just wasn't a
big fan of her eyeshadow because it was
a little overdone and although this was
a Lea's look for the video it just it
was a lot you could tell they really
went in but other than that that was
fine people were offended because they
said it was cultural appropriation
because she was a Lea and she not black
well I was Hollywood hair Barbie okay
there was quite a few black girls who
went as Selena there's quite a few
people there was a lot of black girls
last year who went as Harley Quinn there
are some girls who are not black there
are some white girls there are some
Spanish girls there are some Asian girls
who go as the Spice Girls and all of
them are different ethnicities
it's fucking Halloween I really hate
when somebody doesn't like somebody they
just can't say I don't like her if you
don't like Kim I don't have anything
personal against Kim Kardashian besides
the stupid shit she said which we
already discussed but other than that I
don't have anything against Kim so for
me I personally feel like a lot of y'all
who don't like somebody will find a
reason as to why you don't like them
instead of saying I just don't like them
and I'm saying like I said in the
beginning of this video I'm not a big
fan of Nikki's like that I'm not but I
can respect the woman from what she's
done I just feel like again the paper
magazine was a little bit beneath her
personally for me I just thought it was
beneath her I thought cardi yes her no
but anyway um yeah and then Jacqueline
Hill which we're
take a turn here and then like
Jacqueline do was just totally random to
this but I have a point here
Jacqueline actually had a Halloween
party she wore an afro people said that
she was culture appropriating black
people because you were a blond afro to
a Halloween party oh oh oh and that it
first and foremost I know a lot of
Jewish kids who got hella curly fucking
hair who hair sometimes mean a beard in
mines so should they be offended - she
clowns be offended like I don't I don't
it's Halloween if it's any other day or
she dressed up as Foxy Brown and says
black plower with and blackface I can
understand why y'all being mad but some
of y'all are just so fucking sensitive
I'm gonna do a video about sensitivity
I'm gonna be getting too much into it
then it was saying oh the girl was that
her party was dressed as Pocahontas was
disrespectful because the history of
Pocahontas
well the bitch didn't make the outfit
and if she did it is what it is but I'm
sure if you got an issue with that let's
start with Disney because they still
dumb fucking costumes here fuck around
and I don't see none of you
motherfuckers getting an issue with that
but I'm not gonna even get into them in
my video here cuz I got that one to do
next but yeah um it's a lot going on
um and entertainment I'm gonna try to
come to y'all once a week I just been
coming like on a sabbatical cuz I just
been kind of over the internet so I just
been kind of minding my business and
then working on my doll stuff and then
all that stuff so anyway I hope you guys
enjoyed this I will catch you guys in my
next one on my social media should be
like over here over here or and it's
gonna be down below as well and and I
will catch y'all in my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
