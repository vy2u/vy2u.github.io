each other so long I know y'all y'all
been missing my ignorant miss okay so
I'm here to talk about the drama that
has been going on with the Queens Court
okay if you guys don't know what the
plaintiffs court is it was was and
YouTube show with TS Madison and rapper
now comedian kaya and they had they
would get together and kind of do what I
used to do with my friends we we just
sit and talk about like current events
that were going on and then just kind of
give you this very unfiltered situation
okay about a week and a half ago two
weeks ago the show pretty much abruptly
stopped it was an interview that was
supposed to be with the comedian and
Academy award-winning actress miss
Monique and yeah that really didn't turn
out too well and kaya left the show
while the show was live July ho and then
yeah now we're hearing that the show is
pretty much done ts Madison and kya are
now I don't want to say beefing because
I feel like that's a very incorrect
thing to say because I think it's only
like it's kind of one-sided at this
point but I'm just gonna kind of give
you my feelings on it and have
everything okay huh it's transpired and
it kind of came about so um I know what
you guys are probably thinking about to
do in this it was just drag higher and
that's kind of I was about to happen
um and I love Madison and I'm not gonna
drag her either
I'm kind of I want to look at this is
from a different standpoint standpoint
is this is one of the reasons why I
don't like to do business with friends
and family because usually this is not
what happens you know so pretty much for
my understanding just gave you guys a
backstory of what happened the Queens
Court was an Internet show that it would
literally just sit at a kitchen table
and have a conversation then it became
pretty much where they turned around and
it'd be like robes and it felt more like
a courtroom and with a set okay so I
wasn't a big fan of the set I'm gonna be
honest because the more of
and raw personality that type with
that that's what I subscribe to
that's I got lights right now but I'm
literally in my closet okay literally in
my closet it needs to be clean but um
they did that and it kind of changed the
formula and I understood wise because
again when you have like TV execs and
stuff like that that made me watch it I
didn't understand
any of this prior to the other day that
they had like this whole deal situation
that was going on and when you do have
that what happens is didn't have people
who are watching your every single move
and the thing about the internet that's
so great is that when you're able to
actually sit here and I can cuss I can
say whatever the hell I want to and no
one can tell me no unless I get a little
too crazy with it but overall I should
be okay
the thing about TV is when you do get on
TV there's a censorship there is some so
many cuss words that you can say there's
only so many times you can say bitch in
a reality show there's only so many
times that you can say and until it has
to be bleeped out so for me I feel like
watching the Queen's court and
everything that has happened and
transpired between the two of them I
don't want to say this but I'm gonna be
honest which I've seen it come in I
didn't want to say it I like I love the
show and I love the formula and I love
Maddie and I love Kanye together and KY
has blocked me on Twitter years ago cuz
I call her little Wayne stunt-double
because the bitch was talking crazy to
me but I learned to like her again
through the Queens Court now I feel like
the things that I was feels for her are
kind of the same but Madison is actually
she's almost innocent in this either
because Algy you guys are kind of my
reasons as to why you guys know that
I've had stuff with my friends I've had
stuff with people from YouTube just
stuff like years ago I did some stuff
with somebody from YouTube in they used
me and that's why I'm around
more but the thing was kaya has always
been kaya okay I've never known her to
be anything outside of hiya that's
that's what made this show great kaya
doesn't work very well and I can I can
kind of vouch me because I'm kind of the
same when somebody wants to
something that I've done and takes that
off that off that off um not so much of
this sign your name right there and
that's it
kya has always been an independent
artist and that's what she's you know
always going off I did my own bitch
I sit on my red couch bitch and I do
what I do I understand that and I can I
can see where she's coming from because
the thing is and I think overall what
people are not seeing is that they both
built this together okay regardless of
who your favorite was where there was
one or the other they still were the
encompass meant of you know the Queen's
court now Madison says that she went she
got money for that she got money for
that she got money for that she got
money for that and kyliyah could end on
money now on her end I get it too
because I had things where people
literally have told me I needed this
this is dissonant and I went brought
these things and none of them worked and
I didn't get my money back from that you
know I'm saying so the thing you we all
know when you don't put your
money into nothing and you ain't reached
in your pocket you don't like all kind
of stupid for you bitch but I didn't
spend my but when it's someone
else's money and then you kind of give
them that whole you dumb it makes it
seem like you're very unappreciative so
I understand why Madison was so
irritated by everything that happened I
also feel like because the deal was
supposed to be Nicki Minaj presents the
Queens Court kiyah in my opinion just
based on when I know from her she said
why this bitch gotta be on it
she did she brought nothing to the
table with who is she why they gotta be
her presention why can't just be
us you know I'm saying I feel like
that's where Chi is attitude came from
and rightfully so because the whole
Queen and you know all that stuff
happened because of kaya you get what
I'm saying
Madison has a platform that kaya came
upon in addition to all the other things
Madison was doing but haram kaya
together became the Queens Court so is
that why do we need Nikki to do this but
you do and here's why today kaya's name
is known
on the same level is like a zillion
banks drama okay
she's talking about all these things
that she's done and again I don't want
to take anything away from kaya I don't
because I do think that she's talented I
do think that she's a great composer I
do think that she's a pretty good
songwriter the bitch can write a hit
about anything a lot of bitches can't do
that but I also feel like on the other
side kaya is a person who's not willing
she wants a million dollars her way and
the thing about it is when you don't
have a million dollars and somebody else
is willing to give it to you there's
leaps hurdles and balance that you have
to go to in order to get that money now
to her respect I get it because what you
don't want to do is literally sign over
the Queens Court to the production
company and then sign it over to vh1
let's just say it was gonna be from vh1
well the problem with that is that you
can't you I don't know if you guys know
this but there are people who have
created show that got kicked off their
own show okay there are people who
created shows that you gotta go now
because the show no longer belongs to
them you get what I'm saying I was just
watching an interview with rodney
chester and daryl stevens from noah's
ark and they were like why don't you
guys just do the show again now and he
was like well when pat toomey Patrick
got the show or local he sold the rights
to logo so we can't do any he can't do
anything without logos approval so if
they wanted to sit on the show for the
rest of its lifespan it just will we
don't have no control over that he got
his cut of that money and that was it so
from a business standpoint I get Chaya I
get it but from another dead business
standpoint I don't feel like the claims
that she made that Madison stole the
Queens Court from her or put her name on
something that didn't belong to her was
just and it wasn't okay and here's why I
feel this way because as a person who is
working with you I do have a stake in
this because I'm sitting on that bench
with you okay now it's a name okay and
she fell for a copyright because
apparently somebody was saying that they
wanted to go ahead and they were gonna
snatch it from them and then take the
formula and then run with it I have seen
by fall bitches and robes at this
 point
and I'm gonna with nobody say when
something's in this hot no matter how
stupid dumb you think it is in a moment
when things become hot they become
lucrative and everybody on this
 platform is looking for
their next check so would that be in the
situation it was smart that Madison went
and copy you know got the copyright you
know and the rights to the Queens Court
and guys the Queen's quite calm and she
was trying to make sure that they were
good even though Caillou was not willing
to put reaching her pocket
and for her Medicaid ban to make sure
that things May 6
if that makes it you know just make sure
that everything had a rhyme and a reason
for it
I feel like hiya just simply was like
this is not I don't care about this if I
don't get in my way I don't want to do
it and then to a certain degree I used
to be that way because again there's
nothing worse than working so hard for
something and you have somebody who's
gonna come in rearrange change the
formula that you want but at the same
time you can have a balance in the
middle you know I'm saying there were
things that y'all could have done and
worked out first season okay the Nicki
Minaj presents the Queen course second
season we don't want Nicki on harmonica
anymore okay we got enough followers we
got enough she got her money for
what she whatever the deal was and she
don't need to be honest no more can it
just simply be Chi TSP medicine and kaya
presents the Queen's core because at
that point they would have had a name
see the thing is when you first get a
show most production companies most
networks don't know what you will bring
have you ever noticed and this is no
shade you ever noticed a lot of
celebrities or a lot of internet
personalities will get a show and the
show will get cancelled first season and
you guys what this person got our
million s x y&amp;amp;z because everything
doesn't translate to TV as it does on
the Internet internet it's easier
because we have free range to do what we
want to do when you're on TV there are
guidelines there's FCC there's a lot of
people that shoe has to abide by in
order to make this and and quite frankly
kaya would not fit that that formula
she just wooded she's two uncut and
she's too raw for regular TV and if that
was gonna be the situation and she
couldn't say what she wanted to say then
it's no longer the Queens Court it's
it's vh1's court it's MTV's Court is BTS
court now because what originally made
us love the Queens Court was the fact
that they were able to just simply be
who the they were and say what was
on their mind whether you was offended
I wasn't fitted and they was offended
she said it and I think that right there
is something that would work in or
across the pond cuz they'd be naked in
cussing and they don't care here there's
a really big thing about cuss words and
sexual innuendos and you know hate
speech of any sort and hate speech can
fall under something her calling
somebody a gazoo hate speech can fall
under you know hers calling somebody a
bull dagger even though some people
don't feel it's a personal attack some
people will so I understand why she felt
like the changes that were coming didn't
make any sense the thing about all of
this that happens quite frankly is that
kaya was not the person that Madison
should have done this wit from the job
this is not her arena because they let
me be honest with y'all kaya enjoy being
thug mrs.
kaya enjoys the people who like her for
her kaya enjoys being my neck in my bag
kaya enjoys the Medicaid bed kaya enjoys
the red couch so for her doing this on
YouTube and get its essence money it's
completely fine with her so then you
have a Madison Madison wants more she
lives in the Chateau she has her own
plethora of businesses she's doing this
she's doing this she doing she's oh
she's looking for her next cash cow to
submit her ship for the next ten years
so if one person is drinking champagne
and eating caviar and the other person
is eating pickles and drinking a 40
y'all not dining at the same restaurant
and kaya just didn't start like in 40s
yesterday chi it's been like this since
my neck and
back so Madison I love you but wrong
bitch wrong bitch for this it's great
for YouTube it's not great for TV it's
not great because they're not gonna be
able to allow you guys or what it
allowed you guys to simply be yourself
there's no possible way that you would
have been able to call Lorraine daughter
talentless cuz then and then when cuz
think what happens what that is I have a
show on vh1 okay and I'm talking
about this person that person so I got
Nicki Minaj I'm talking about Lil Wayne
Toya Oh when all these people come to
vh1 now none of them want to work with
you anymore
none of the one that comes to any of
your shows anymore why because you have
a show that is talk to them and again
some people can take it and run with it
and be okay with it other people not so
much
and khaya is one of those people who
sometimes hit below the belt so with
that being the situation that would have
been a problem so it's a problematic
issue because that's why she didn't like
I'm sure the terms and conditions that
were in the contract because the
contract pretty much told her bitch yo
you better sit your charm Alf ass down
be nice give us a little bit of Simon
Cowell and that's it but again like I
said that's not the Queen's court
anymore that's not how we met the show
that's not how the show was created in
that formula the show was created with
two friends sit at the table talking
about current events that's what it was
so at this particular point I see that
as of today
Kyah pretty much Tom Addison bitch you
talk too much you should shut the
up the Queen's Court is over I'm doing
the gag order you do what you gotta do
did nobody tell you to tell all that
 business about what we was
doing Mitch you talk too much and it is
what it is so with that being a
situation to me personally I feel like
this was doomed from the start
and it was great for what it was but it
was not gonna be able to flourish
outside of YouTube and unfortunately
that's that's the reality of it okay I
love both of them I think Madison is
great I love kaya for what she gives but
at the same time some people are okay
with being okay
or it's either I'm gonna get it my way
or we ain't gonna do it at all so figure
it out that's that that's the attitude
that KY has with it because there is no
been and and Breck she's very stubborn
and she's okay with being okay Madison's
not okay with with not a focus
she's not okay with bad lighting she's
not okay with that because she wants it
to feel and the best she can make it and
I don't blame her for that because I'm
the same way that's why I chose for my
child play short didn't come out last
year because I didn't like the way that
everything was coming together I want to
go back and fix everything to make it as
right as possible so my take on it is
they should have kept it where it was
the formula should not have changed I
like the original formula most people
did yeah I'm trembling but yeah um I
wish them the best
I'm gonna miss the Queen's court Madison
you ain't gotta worry about nothing and
kaya
girl we're gonna get you some new tires
for that medic a van and some new decals
cuz I heard it is man I just found out
today that doesn't our actual a means of
transportation I thought like she had
other car and it was a van it was like
naw bitch the van is our car I was like
oh she goes to the doctor with
motormouth Kyushu Mohan asada who's how
do you pull up to Burger King in that
 asking for mo more than two
bees how did that work but you know it
happens this is the business is his life
is how things go so I hope you guys did
enjoy this I look out for my other video
that's coming about everything other
thing that's going on in social media
right now and I won't catch you and my
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
