talk today I plan to religion upload a
review in the tutorial today in the it's
not in the cards so I think I've woken
up there has been some poppin off
it's just a mess on social media today I
don't know what it is
the child my nerves okay the first thing
no reading take no time the first thing
is Ginuwine is under fire for rejecting
and refusing to kiss a trans woman on
live television is it rejecting and
refusing like the same difference you
know you just didn't want to do it
that's what they both okay whatever so I
don't know who this bitch is I don't
know but let me just say this cuz we
were saying they're calling him
transphobic okay y'all know I go hard
for my LGBT community and right is right
and wrong is wrong so bitch in this
situation if you call him transphobic
bitch imma need you to sit your
 ass down have several seats
in that hard-ass chair because there is
no possible way that a man who
identifies as a straight man is
transphobic because a woman who
identified as a trans woman tries to
kiss him on national TV and he rejects
her and says no you know lena kills me
about this is a lot of people who
believe this is transphobic are the same
people that believe that it's wrong that
man touch women based on the way that
they dress and saying that they asked
for it is up and i agree to that
but this is the same difference
you can't brand somebody something
because let me tell you something he a
better man did me cuz i wanna knock that
bitch fronts straight to heart throw
don't you ever put your hands on
me let alone your lips you
 face bitch to ever believe
that you have the right
as you now see yourself as a trans woman
to put your lips or somebody
that you do not know listen this is less
about her being trans is the more about
that bitch got two
comfortable don't you ever in your
 life put your hands on somebody
that you don't know because you don't
know what they are
she better be lucky this was a little
boozy or closeted ass she better be
lucky this wasn't none of the rappers
that came up when I was coming up cuz
her whole face would have been missing
her whole she'd been hurt
hanging to the side now now I don't know
what's wrong with her so called me
insensitive do what you got to do in the
comment but anybody who believes that
this he didn't say anything you could
tell by the look on his face he was like
oh and to me it's the same the same
 he gives girls that come to his
shows that get a little too touchy-feely
to him yet I'm saying and again I'm not
kissing you bitch I don't know what a
 your bitch babe I don't know if
your bumbum gotta bump
I don't know on your lip got some
shoulders limb I don't know
so you cannot say because she's trans it
could have been because she was trans
but just because you identify as a woman
this doesn't mean that the word and I
fasted I will put it in the cards I sat
in my video to the LGBT community you
gotta look at yourself for who you are
no matter what because just because you
identify as something else does not mean
that everybody is going to see you as
the thing that you identify as it's that
 simple you can take it or leave
it honey but it's the world you better
be lucky he didn't do nothing else I'm
just saying you better be lucky cuz i'ma
tell you I don't care cuz it isn't the
same thing as if a girl that I don't
know that may watch my videos decided to
try to kiss me in the mouth my personal
space is being invaded and that's what
this is about this has less to do with
the fact that she's trans and more to do
with the fact that this is disrespectful
because if this was a different
situation and she happened to be
a woman who was straight and he did the
same thing this wouldn't even be a
headline this would not even been me
would have blinked at that and cause I
did see nothing wrong with it a lot of
trans people that follow me that are in
my comments and don't see anything wrong
with it it only seems like people who
want to cry will because I need
something to cry about
and this is the that I'll be
talking about you can't crying about
 that really doesn't require all of
this you're gonna forever be fighting
for something because you have people
that want to label like this and
this is not everybody so don't take what
I'm saying as everybody said everybody
did everybody feels not saying that but
the people who are making is a big thing
shut the up for real let let's let
somebody that you don't know no
kiss you in your mouth are you that
 happy are you that giving
bitch cuz I and I'm sure you not and
then the lady there in the back
no she not feel that and homeboy right
here his face say at all he'll
on so again lon personal space maybe she
was drunk maybe she was enough but it
still doesn't excuse the fact that she
did something that was not okay to a man
that she did not know and you got
 out here looking for a
moment not today so since we're we're
gonna talk about hmm and the monkey boy
that they wanted to put up on they
that which I just find to be like it is
2018 and who the is in your
 marketing do you get what
I'm saying y'all don't want to give
nobody on social media a goddamn job
because the money
y'all gonna use somebody in that
 room who said oh let's go
through the photos so we're gonna do the
black boy with the monkey we're gonna do
the white boy with the light you know
the animal tamer
so he's taming him now y'all know how I
am again this is another situation where
a lot of people want to scream there's
an issue I got about four or five GM's
yesterday about the guy who decided to
chug the Indian guy who decided to speak
about the brothers and Warner Brothers
and people like their black man dying
every day like what the are you
talking about Shh like some people
really find an issue with everything but
this was a issue that was an issue this
is something that it
okay okay period if they would have
swapped the shirts the sweaters whatever
now I'm not gonna say that I'm never
gonna go okay this beanie but I'm not
gonna say I'm never gonna shop there
again cuz that would be like service 21
and H&amp;amp;M or might go two places however
what I will say is this I don't think
this was a overall feeling of a company
I feel like whoever did cuz I think you
guys forget that these go through tiers
of people you get what I'm saying
so if I am the head and hmm
chances are I have delegated a job to
someone who I put in responsibility for
stuff like that so I might not have ever
seen that or anything of the sort you
know I'm saying that could have been
somebody that I trusted
what you probably wasn't the best idea
to put that out so I understand why
people are upset and it is up and
I'm happy that the little man
the photo is being redone to show him in
a very different light which i think is
very necessary and it should be done you
know I'm saying he's he's a a kid people
are yelling why would a parent say what
would a parent say well who knows
Unum said this could have been a thing
and and I think people are not realizing
that this shoot could have been for a
whole rack of clothes and a point where
the parent could have been offset they
had not seen it all said they had not
seen it they have never date he's either
doing a photo shoot a lot of times when
your parents or your your your managers
when you're doing something they're off
on the phone doing another deal they're
off over here they could be sleep in a
trailer because they have been joined
this all day who knows what the
situation was so for people to use
appearance as an argument saying you
guys are mad at H&amp;amp;M but why aren't you
mad at the parents the parents probably
didn't see it whoever was doing wardrobe
that day probably didn't think twice
about it it's not okay but I'm not
saying that I feel like people with
anybody dealing with malice but it's
definitely some you give it
like it if this was a case and it got
through the sounding portion who
everyone should have made a call and
said hey are you sure you want to do
this are you sure you want to use this
can we just put you know something else
up can we not do this so that was the
lapse of judgment that didn't reflects
the company I agree to that but at the
same time you also have to understand
that it's not all just H&amp;amp;M as a
corporation and with the corporation
there are a lot of people doing a lot of
different things there are people over
at Apple who never see any of the stock
photos for any of the products until we
see them you know there are people over
there at Microsoft who will never see a
commercial into this on TV and they work
for the commercial there are some people
that work at honey bunches of oats who
don't know what the is going on
until the comes out you know so you
have to think of it like that not like
I'm saying I'm not making excuses for it
but I'm just trying to be playing
devil's advocate here because I think a
lot of people are thinking that it
thinking of it in the wrong way and
they're trying to now just place one
blame in one place and this is not the
first time the H&amp;amp;M or any of the
retailers that we buy from they have
done this but we have to also realize
that if we found an issue with
everything that everybody does we
wouldn't buy anything you know but I'm
happy that people especially celebrities
are using their celebrities to do
something we just speak up about
something that they feel passionately
about because again like I said if they
would have just swapped the sweaters
this wouldn't even be a situation this
would not have been a situation but that
death what is it the cutest monkey to
bomb this monkey the wildest monkey and
it was a monkey involved okay and
there's no reason why little man have to
now be subjected to that like
at all like that to me
you just H&amp;amp;M come on like we have to do
better than that we have got to do
better than that that is some full-out
 if ya ask me so the last thing
that I want to talk about is that you
guys know that Eric garner who was
wrongfully in a chokehold lash at the
boletos last year by the I believe NYPD
his daughter passed away from a heart
attack because she was definitely an
activist for injustice in her community
period and she has passed away I did
however see that common was there which
I love commented does
and I'll sharped it happened to be there
and it sparked something in me because
the first thing that I thought was
out Sharpton that was the first thing
that came by Thurgood Marshall just like
the PJs his his parents just who he is
him and Jesse Jackson are two people I
don't give a how cool y'all was
with dr. King they are ambulance chasers
if I've ever seen them and I know some
people gonna be mad at me saying this
but again this goes back to the girl who
was upset about the guy who made the
comment about Warner Brothers ethical
I'm at the Golden Globes how she felt
away there were so many people of color
that were at the Golden Globes and no
one said anything that had to do with
that Oprah's speech was amazing you know
I love opal and you know last night was
a testament that if we band together no
matter what our skin colour look like we
can actually stand up for something that
was great and I feel like in this
situation I want to say this because
it's needs to be said
you have to stop allowing people who
aren't you to speak for you you get what
I'm saying
we all have Instagram pages we all have
Twitter pages we all have Facebook pages
and we can share a cardi B song we can
share a Nicki Minaj feature but we can't
seem to share our sentiments about
something that we all feel the same
about you know and you want somebody
because the girl came to me saying you
should do a video about this no I'm not
 doing a video i body won't shoot
do a video about it you get what I'm
saying
well you're rich is larger my reach
didn't get here from me sitting here not
saying anything no you get rid of like
you have to be responsible for yourself
and the people who look like you and the
people who represent you and the people
that you feel closest to and you feel an
injustice for you have to do that it's
not my responsibility to speak for every
black person or every gay person or all
you know in this that's not my
responsibility
but the reason why I say this is because
when you look at somebody like al
Sharpton and you look at somebody like
Jesse Jackson these are people who are
perpetuated and got money off of the
backs of dead black kids and no one says
anything about it they want to come
when cameras and lights and is
there and that's the problem that I have
if you're gonna I know I know Jesse
Jackson for nothing else then getting a
check okay well I know I can hear now
what Jesse hasn't done
jesse hasn't done enough how about that
and I'm saying that for my
who's here with half a million I got
more reach than his ass dude what are
you doing when other things happen I've
never seen Jesse or I'll during a trans
gay issue never so again what we're
gonna stop doing what we need to stop
doing what I suggest we stop doing is
putting people that are of power and
positions to speak for you because
you're gonna forever and always be
disappointed again speak up when you
feel it's necessary when you feel away
when you feel slighted don't wait for
nobody to speak for you because you'll
be waiting for the rest of your
life
so in closing i'ma go over the Golden
Globes last night I did not watch I seen
all the highlights Thank You familis in
the room cuz I can't but it was
great to see everybody come in
solidarity to just just times up we're
not doing this anymore we're
not dealing with this anymore
and it show that like I said this
transgender this transcends everything
it's about what's right and what's wrong
and that should always and forever be
the fight it's about what's right and
what's wrong no matter what the color
what's the gender what it is and it was
great to see that last night
you see people to come together for a
better cause so again I'm gonna go cuz I
have clearly to do but I just
wanted to come and say that again Oh
chick with the slump face she got the
game up low man did not deserve
that but this is me if anything make him
a bigger star than he already was meant
to be and out Sharpton and then on
the on on top of all of that if we come
together and we do great things together
we can make a really big difference I
hope you guys enjoyed this I will put
all my links to you guys to my social
medias low and our pitch shot in the
next
