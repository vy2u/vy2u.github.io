been a minute since I was like did a
video but also since I've did like a
koala to talk to so happy New Year to
all of yous out there
hope you guys had a great Christmas and
a great new year I had a great time I
just been like literally working like
crazy I don't know if you guys know but
I have a doll channel that I've started
on YouTube which I will list below
there's nothing on the channel as yet
because I don't actually start putting
stuff and content on that channels for
January 16th but I will have a whole
different side of YouTube which is a
whole different side of me and how
things work in the doll life and the toy
life that I'm like really into that I
don't share much fun here or dolls like
such of myself that will be featured on
that channel for this year but I wanted
to do a closet talk and this for the
first of the year about business okay
business is something that I don't speak
about a lot on YouTube just because it's
like very personal whenever an unjust
thing like you know Paris Hilton taught
me if you talk about money it's tacky so
but I do want to talk about this because
I have gotten a little frustrated and a
little annoyed with the fact that I
understand that a lot of people will
like for me to review for their hair
companies that's what I'm kind of here
for and I totally get that but the issue
that I have is the fact that the
business side of things always go awry
and that's why you guys see a lot more
reviews for me for like Aliexpress
companies then you see for US companies
so I'll get into that so recently I've
been contacted more often just like a
backstory
I am booked out into June of this year
so I don't have any more spaces for any
reviews until after June and I will not
start taking those until literally
almost after June because it's been I've
like booked myself out and it just keeps
myself busy it keeps my fine
situation very stable and it gives me a
nice window to work in and in the last
the last like month or so I fall in like
really really really far behind and a
lot of reviews for just reasons of me
needing a break just overextending
myself and didn't like doing too much
and then I just get flustered and then
it's like I just can't like it I drop
myself just crazy but anyway um so I get
hit up a lot from the us-based companies
that want me to review for them but the
problem with that that I usually find is
the fact that they want me to work for
free and when I say work for free I mean
literally what they would like to do and
they like to do this often which it says
hi I love everything that you do and I'm
such a big fan if I work you for a long
time and I would like to send you free
hair and in exchange for review of my
hair company now here's the problem with
that I have more hair at this point in
my life that I've ever had him like ever
okay I could weave a third world nation
with the amount of hair that I have in
my position right now okay I give up a
lot of your way okay I give a lot of us
sisters hair cousins hair you know just
all the time the problem with that is
that what you what you're asking me to
do is if I would ask you guys to do this
so let's just say you worked at Target
right and I say hey would you like to
work here and you say yes and then you
say yes I'll give you a job and I
literally pay you with the products in
the store so when every two weeks rolls
around I say hey would you like some
Vegas Nate
eyelashes would you like some toilet
paper but you need to pay your rent
right and you need to pay your Cardinal
right and your car note doesn't take
Vegas named lashes or Charmin they take
currency so the problem is what a
company will ask me to do is this I want
you to wear my hair review my hair test
my hair make a video
tag me tag my company all for exchange
for hair that you got at a wholesale
price and what do I get into change free
hair amazing it doesn't work that way I
don't know a lot of us who are over most
likely to 300,000 marks most of us get
PR some people's TR is not free some
people charge for PR meaning they'll
charge the company a certain amount in
order for them to send them products and
talk to you guys about it's a business
and I think a lot of people are confused
about how the business work because I
think a lot of people believe that if
you get paid to do something then you're
automatically lying about what you're
doing and that's not the situation well
people have to understand about how this
works now this is not a typical job how
YouTube works what people pay for and
now I can only speak for myself is the
exposure to you guys okay there's over a
half a million people that I'm exposing
their company to not only that I'm
exposing them to my talents as well so
therefore I'm gonna I don't care how bad
I hate I got some hair if it's really
that bad you guys will never see it on
this channel it's just not gonna happen
I'm not gonna bet do bash videos I did
it's a waste of my time and that's time
that don't get back and usually when
that happens the company does not want
to pay you because they don't want to
pay for a bad review so instead of me
going back and forth and trying to fight
for money and fight for me I just want
to deal with you and I'll let somebody
else do that but I'm personally just now
I'm not doing the so if I feel like
you can use areas of improvement I'll do
a video and I'll tell you guys hey I
like this about I like this I don't like
this I don't like this and I don't like
that you guys know when I was wearing
frontals are very popping right now but
when I was wearing wigs a lot there were
companies that I complained video after
video after video about about hair
density and it didn't take them
what then it's in yes to up their
density and then what happens is I no
longer with companies like that
because they get to a situation where
they feel like we don't want to pay you
what you're worth we just want to pay
you what we've been paying you because
even though we're charging
X amount of dollars we can't afford it
so that means you can't afford me
because I'm not working for free and I
wouldn't ask any of y'all to work for
free if you worked at Target you don't
go to work at Target for the love of the
bullseye you go there to get your check
you get what I'm saying and you're gonna
do your job and you're gonna do it love
your hairstylist you're gonna charge
your clients because you need to pay
your money you need to pay your rent you
need to pay your bills you need to
sustain your living calls it's calls so
if that's the situation you can't expect
for somebody to do something because
they've built their stuff literally
blood sweat and tears and because you
just are new in the game or you've been
fledgling for so long all of a sudden
this person has to do something for you
because you feel like you year old it
all right they should just give it to
you case in point one year Oprah Winfrey
decided that she wanted to do hey my
favorite things show and she of course
the show is where she features all her
favorite things in the show one of the
things that she wanted to feature in the
show was iPads she was obsessed with the
iPad iPad had just came out had the only
thing that I've had I've been out a year
at that point so she wanted to becoming
like one of the first people now you
know people act with Oprah acts for
something she gets it well Apple could
give a about the color purple
Harpo Stedman the dogs her bunions her
corns her bags they didn't care they
wanted to say we don't mind you feature
in the iPads in your favorite things
show no problem but you're not getting
them for free you're gonna pay us for
them because our iPads and our they
sell with or without over so we don't
need you so what point would it make if
you're contacting us and we're telling
you no you have two options either take
the no or give us our money it's up to
you boom figure it out but we're not
gonna do it so hard people kept going
back and forth back and forth back and
forth and when all was said and done she
had to pay for him so if she wanted to
give away a hundred and fifty free iPads
even though she has the money you know
I'm saying she wasn't gonna get that for
free because they understood what their
worth was as a company and that's how I
look at myself if I'm booked out into
June and I've been bugged out to Junie
and probably
right before Christmas that's when it
closed off I don't need anybody else to
do anything I don't need a company to
come to me and ask me to work for free
because they feel like I have the
following and I'm making enough money
cuz you don't know what my financial
situation is you only know what I let
you see you can't expect for somebody to
just do something I would never ask you
guys know I've been working on my doll
line for a very long time and what I
could have done and I'm sure it would
have been fine if I open a GoFundMe and
ask all of you who are watching this
video to donate between five and a
hundred dollars for me to get the money
but what did I do
I didn't want to do that I took the
money that I made from all of my hair
reviews and all of my YouTube money and
everything that I've saved and I stashed
away and I use that to mine for the
resources that I had to make what is
what and what I have today okay and I
don't think if people understand
building a doll from scratch is very
expensive because you goes through a lot
of parts and although they this small
they cost a lot especially when you're
shipping stuff back and forth you have
three painters you have people that do
hair you have to get custom outfits made
you have to get shoes you have to figure
out the skin tone is right all these
things cost all of these things cost so
I didn't want to ax you guys to say I
don't want to dig in my pocket for my
dream you have to dig in your pocket for
using you have to spend money to make
money period and I haven't even gotten
to the point where I want to make the
money part for my doll I'm only
fulfilling dreams and stuff that I
really want to do it and and that I'm
excited to even be able to say this doll
looks exactly like me you get what I'm
saying like I don't think people
understand that it is money that costs
and I can't pay a repaint or I can't pay
a sculptor I can't pay a 3d artist and
Virgin Indian hair I can't play
Brazilian body waves in my bank account
you get what I'm saying so my message to
all of you girls all of you guys all of
you people out there when you are
running a business and you are trying to
invest into your business make sure you
have money set aside for your business
because what's gonna have
is everybody can be the nicest person in
the world they still not gonna work for
free that's just that's just what it is
they're not gonna work for free now now
let me tell you there are exceptions to
the rule because you guys may or may not
know but still every day right now I my
dream car it's a convertible Bentley in
pepto-bismol pink with white interior
and pepto-bismol piping and accents okay
with the Barbie bees in the sea that's
it yeah Billy came to me today and said
hey we'll give you your dream car if you
just shot us out on Instagram or shot us
out on you know snapchat of course I
would do it because they're giving me
something that I can't give myself
they're they're putting me in a
situation and they're giving me a
project that I don't I can't get myself
but if there's something that I can get
I can go out and buy a whole bunch of
hair right now I could go out in and
pretty much buy what my heart desires I
can go to Louboutin I can go to all
these I can go to Makino I can do all of
these things so if I can do that off of
the talent and working hard why would I
give somebody else the opportunity to
pretty much just float by you're gonna
work as hard - I'm not gonna
give it to you it's that simple
I don't do discounts for the homies we
ain't homies we're business partners
okay now some people can get a little
mad about this this next part but it is
what it is cuz I'm keepin it 100 which
is the beginning of the year and I've
let it go girl there are a lot of girls
that hit me up who are growth of color
and I always say no I'm gonna tell you
why I've had the biggest issue with
girls of color not wanting to pay now
not everybody cuz I work with Princess
hair shop I work with magic hair company
I work with her hair company I work with
a lot of pay places um virgin hair
obsession all those are black owned
business D hair boutique is a black home
business but the problem is most of the
girls who come in who don't want to like
grow they just want something for free
and people feel like well you have a big
following why don't you want to just
help me you know with with with my
business I think it's really selfish of
you to do this because I started off
with one subscriber - and I started off
with one follower - okay and what did I
do
you guys can look at my track record
I've never
ever ever ever ever ever and I'm nothing
is wrong but for me ever asks anybody to
do anything for me
not a shout-out not a video not a
collaboration nothing I haven't and I'm
not and the reason why I'm not gonna do
that is because I know what I can do I'm
a one band man if you contract me for
review understand that if your hair
passed all my tests you're gonna get a
great intro that I don't listen I do
everything myself I do all my life I'll
do all of my style and I do all of my
makeup I do my hair I do my shooting I
do everything so all of that stuff cause
when you look at in trolls that I do all
those lights cost you're giving up
that's not free those outfits I have on
cause the first cost girl because I'm
trying to give you a quality product so
I'm not just showing you the hair I
could sit there like everybody else and
just tell you hey today guys I'm gonna
talk about my hair better I don't want
to do that because everybody's doing
that it's boring so I want to know
whether you come for just a review or
you come for the intro just understand
that I'm gonna give you something that's
worth and that's how you make sure that
your brand is worth something to give
them what everybody else isn't giving
you know and that's something that I
pride myself on because again I'm not
gonna be like everybody else
I don't want to be a basic ass bitch
doing basic ass because after a
while that gets old
so again understand your situation and
I'm not trying to put anybody down or
make anybody feel bad I'm just want you
to understand the reality of the
situation if I went to Jackie I know
right now and say hey auntie Jackie
listen here girl
I want to do a collaboration video with
you you do my makeup and undo your hair
and now we'll be cute that's fine but if
Jackie says well no because I don't see
how that would benefit me regardless of
the fact of I think the idea is cute it
doesn't benefit me and as a
businesswoman she has the right to say
no because I met over half a million and
she's over a million so all the people
who follow me who may actually watch
that may already be subscribed to her
she don't get nothing from that I'm not
mad about that you get what I'm saying I
understand my position nothing that I
will never be there but I'm not there
yet
listen some of us have to be Michelle
before we Beyonce and a lot of y'all is
in between Kelly and Michelle and y'all
trying to be Beyonce and then you get it
mad when somebody gives you the ashanti
fair Franklin treatment bitch thank you
for what it is okay take it for what it
is but understand your situation
understand where you at and again it's a
business it's business stop taking it
personal it's not personal I love
everybody who watched me and again all
my videos that I do are 100% honest if I
don't like something I'm I let the
company know you may be a little mad at
me at everything this girl I said what I
said okay
ain't changing up over here so I hope
you guys enjoyed this I hope you guys
had a great Christmas a great New Year
and you know understand it is a business
and whatever you do where there's hair
boutiques whatever invest in your brand
and invest in your brand means money
figure out a way sometimes you can't
make money in something unless you
invest it from somewhere else you might
have to work at Walmart in order to
invest into your your hair dream or your
boutique dream but don't expect for
everybody to work for free because we
all got bills honey we all gotta live
when we all gotta make that money we all
got to get that bag so yeah I hope you
guys enjoyed this I will catch you guys
in my next one I got a lot of reviews
coming out like I said I'm very backed
up and don't get me wrong I was doing
reviews for almost three years
completely free I was getting paid in
nothing but hair and a company owner
came to me and was the first one she was
a woman of color and she was a woman of
color so keep that in mind and she said
what are you doing and I'm like what do
you mean she said are you like I
understand that you know you dig they're
sending you the product but are they
paying you for your time are they paying
you for that thread are they paying you
for that cap are they paying you for
those lights are they paying you for
that intro no then you don't do that for
free honey and literally that changed my
life because it made me understand the
value of myself people will use you if
you let them period you get what I'm
saying and again a lot of people believe
that we as reviewers will lie or we only
get good hair honey I've had hair that's
burnt on me I've had hair that is smoked
on me I've had hair that was literally
fell apart while I was wearing it from
companies wigs weaving
in between I will never feature those on
my channel it's up to you to figure that
out cuz that's not my business to tell
you what's good and what's bad I'm Tim
I'm here to give you the better end of
things if you don't see it on my channel
trust and believe they hit me up and I
said no kids that simple
okay so yeah you it's a slippery slope
but at the same time y'all have to
understand our side of it people want to
say well because in a smaller company
you should just give him a chance no
they should give their self a chance and
they should try a little bit harder cuz
I nobody gave me a chance I had to do it
on my own you get what I'm saying it's
not hard work it's something that a lot
of people don't understand today it's
real you should try it it's real and I'm
just I mean I'm giving y'all the real
deal Holyfield sense of it all right now
it's a real situation you have to invest
in yourself and know your Worth and
understand everything people want to act
like because we're youtubers that this
is not a form of advertising it is do
you think that Pepsi went to Britney
Spears in the 90s and say hey Britney um
we want you to do a huge commercial to
promote our products but we'll just pay
you in Pepsi for the rest of your lives
you think she was like shy yeah I shall
do it yeah no she did it she said it
worth my money is that simple she's
still selling you a product now I drink
I like coke personally but I drink a
little more Pepsi cuz Brittany was there
you know it depends I'm not against that
Beyonce same thing you think that
Beyonce and JLo get on the more y'all
commercials and swinging the hair and
look into the camera gracefully and give
you top model eyes for hurry they don't
they're still selling you hair dye but
they don't they're not doing that for
the love of their fans they're doing it
because it's a business and that's how
they make their money so understand that
now who you choose to listen to is based
on you who you believe and disbelieve is
on you but at the same time you also
have to understand that I am only one
opinion based on something that I was
sent okay so if let's just say for the
sake of saying the company did send me
the best hair that they have and then
they started sending out bad hair then
you come back and report that to me to
let me know but then I'll take that up
with a company and try to figure out how
to fix the situation there are companies
that I've done this before
and I don't work with them anymore you
get what I'm saying but
I can't say well Meyer was great but all
the reviews are bad so I don't know
usually if that's the case I just don't
work with him yeah yes guys y'all know
y'all always ask me can you work with
this person can you work with that
person and I'm like no I don't know I
don't know if I'm saying no to you it's
for a reason cuz they definitely hit me
up okay you know so understand my
position in all of this and understand
that I do do things for the betterment
of you guys and I do say no a lot for
the betterment of you guys because I'm
be honest which I'm and just keep it
real transparent right now there was a
company last year who was trying to pay
me a lot of money and I mean a lot of
money to just sit there and promote hair
that was trash and when I say a lot of
money y'all I could have got the car of
my dreams I said it earlier so if I
would have just took that and for three
months did what they wanted me to do not
work with anybody else I could have had
my car but that car wasn't worse than my
reputation that car wasn't worse what
I've worked hard for that car was not
worth my name you get what I'm saying
that it wasn't because again no matter
what I say and who is coming from I'm
still the person who's look as a it's a
situation that happened recently where
somebody brought some air because of me
and the hair and I contacted the
company and they got say money back and
they'd have this in air back but I went
off on a company like why would you do
this you get what I'm saying
that's it has to issue with me last year
long wolf is only a day in but yet last
year a company sold Oh ballpark number
about $5,000 away from me after I did
what was requested of me and nobody
getting me my money back
nobody said how you gonna pay your bills
nobody said how you gonna pay your car
note nobody nobody said that this is
money that was really stolen out of my
pocket from somebody lie so I understand
how it feels to expect one thing and
then somebody does I'm still looking for
two I still buy things too so I know how
that feels but you have to understand my
opinion is not the only opinion you have
to take this opinion for what it is and
then you make do what you can with it I
don't stop asking me what is the best
hair what is this
you look at the
use they're here for a reason stop being
lazy okay so if I did a video in our
nail doesn't video and then IV doesn't
video on a company and we all love the
air chances are the hair is pretty good
chances are cuz I understand my side and
their sides as well we don't live for
 if we don't like it I'm gonna tell
you everything I don't like about it but
if there's mixed reviews then you still
have to figure out if you're gonna take
that chance or not because again I can
only review what I have in front of me I
can't review a whole line because I'm
not the company ya happy 2018 yo great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
