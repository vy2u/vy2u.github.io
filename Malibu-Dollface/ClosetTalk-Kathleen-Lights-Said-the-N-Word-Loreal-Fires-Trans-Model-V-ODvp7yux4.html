decided who my hair right here say I
can't see the reflection I decided to go
ahead and do a video because someone
just tweeted someone just tweeted me and
said 'we didn't see what malibu doll
face and jackie ina has to say about
jaclyn hill and kathleenlights drama
like oh um apparently you guys know i'm
not really a big fan of a lot of the
beauty girls here on youtube like i
don't care so when i did see the video
of kathleenlights which i just found out
who she even was um saying the n-word
when she was playing the anonymous ad
I got a VR headset a Playstation one -
goodness this is scary but she's
been where she's an old don't give
me your don't grab me or was
something like that it was
involved and people were like oh she's
racist she's racist you racist
now this is a different situation than
it is with you-know-who because in this
situation I don't feel like at all for
whatever reason she said it in a
malicious way but it does show that she
uses this type of language in her
everyday life and she accidentally
slipped up in a moment of having fun she
slept out of kathleenlights the YouTube
girl and fell into kathleenlights this
is what me and my do so I wasn't
offended by it the only thing is you
gotta watch what you say in private
because it will like sometimes I'll say
certain words here when I'm doing
reviews and I'd be like you can't say
that so I have to stop Reeth it and then
redo it now Jacqueline Hill was
recording it now when I seen it in the
video you can hear her husband saying do
not post that and apparently she
opposed to the
so that was already a problem within
itself
she shoulda posted it now and then but I
have more of an issue with the rebuttal
from what was said as opposed to what
actually originally was saying so
that she was like you know Kathleen
feels very bad about what she said and
she just can't believe she said those
words juggling plan lady rich didn't use
that she don't listen you don't say
words automatically so organic like that
that you just simply don't use everyday
in everyday life like girl come on now
we I'm stupid oh it's sometimes but not
oh I was born at night not last night
okay girl so a lot of people are I guess
I'm mad about it
and I'm not offended by it because
they're because I come listen I grew up
in LA I'm from LA this is there's a lot
of people I had a white boyfriend who
used the word he never said it he had a
lot of black friends and he never said
it in a very derogatory way it was more
of a hey hi
with Tana mojo tried to say she thought
it was like that um so I never really
got offended by him using the word I
have cousins who are have black they use
it some of their parents who are white
use it so again it's one of those things
that it's not okay because everybody's
not okay with somebody who's not coming
from there but there's a lot of Hispanic
people who use the word like and a lot
of Dominicans who use the word often
because they're considered to be black
and they're late there's a lot of
Hispanic people who live here especially
Mexicans and a lot of the Mexican
culture that I know we used to like go
to school together when you go to a lot
of public schools here it's a lot of
black and Mexican a lot of black and
Mexican so that that rhetoric of what is
said to one boy to another boy who has a
Hispanic friend that's gonna eventually
just fall over into that not to say that
it's okay but in this situation I don't
feel like she was malicious about it I
don't feel like she had like a negative
connotation she was like don't
give me like that's how I took it
so I unless I hear her say something
else I necessarily don't have a problem
with it and the degree in what she said
however girl watch yourself because
there are some people who are not gonna
want to watch your videos and mess with
the kathleenlights situation because
they feel like that's because I don't
think people understand the difference
between slang and being racist we
erases is calling somebody a
bitch using slang that isn't necessarily
for you is called being ignorant and not
being smart about what you're doing
why cameras I roll him although like I
said she had a VR headset on she
couldn't see what that Jacqueline was
recording her because I just brought one
too and I did the inexperienced and
bitch when I tell you I don't want to
see another sewage drain ever in the
movie and even out and yes I'm going to
see it okay so the next thing that I'm
going to talk about is going to be
another race related topic which is
about the transgender girl who was fired
from l'oréal for saying that all white
people were racist and a lot of people
feel like L'Oreal is should be ashamed
of themselves and it's not fair and she
was speaking her truth and she got an
opinion and why does she have to lose
her opportunity because she said what
the truth is now you guys know some
people think I'm trans I'm not if you
catch me on a regular day I'm not
looking you know
like Olivia so you know my issue with
this was this not what she said it's how
she said it know how she worded it when
you used it the word all that means that
is an accomplishment of an entire
community and which is being spoke about
such as all gay people are from Miss Q
is all black women are ghetto all black
fathers our absentee dad's that's what
you say so that means that everybody who
doesn't fit into that category is now
offended by what you said there's a way
to say something without sounding like a
complete asshole about it so in this
situation do I feel like her firing was
just yes the reason why because people
are trying to make it seem like well
they only want inclusion when somebody
doesn't say anything you know what
there's a code of conduct when you go to
work whether you work at Starbucks
McDonald's Google YouTube because
everything that you feel doesn't need to
be said if you feel like this this
country is so bad and you feel like just
the way that white people are running
this in this situation is so bad once
you go somewhere else you know and I'm
not saying that her having an opinion
means that she needs to leave because
other people just gonna say
go but you had an opportunity and you
had an opportunity to change what you
felt was really that seriously from the
way in cuz you can't change him when you
on the front porch of the
establishment so what she should have
done was shut the up get the
off of Facebook use her opportunity to
educate and enlighten people and her way
through this company this is a fortune
500 company this is a L'Oreal has been a
law around for a very long time the fact
that they even asked her as a trans
woman to be part of the campaign I
thought was amazing
so she people like well I don't see
anywhere that she lied I said but the
thing is I'm not saying that what she
feels is wrong I'm not saying that but
you can't say everybody you can't use
words like all because that means that
if somebody says all trans women are men
then you will be offended right because
you are considered passable for those
who don't know what passable is it's in
the trans community when girls who looks
more like a woman who the girls who are
like the ones who are just you really
started their transition they're caught
the boogers okay there are the ugly
girls that they say this is what this is
are girls in a try oh I'm only repeating
what I had heard so when I hear someone
speak like that and they are there are
minority in the problem that you have is
you're trying to my issue is this I've
been through this personally and what
she said was from her personal
experience but this happened to me when
I was in high school I had a teacher you
guys want him at the high school for one
semester in that semester I had a math
teacher she was very very rude to me and
I couldn't figure out for the life of me
why she was so rude I didn't do anything
I did not work okay I knew more ago I
don't supposed to but there are a lot of
people in there who wasn't during I work
that didn't get the treatment that I got
so once I ended up running rolling from
the school what about my day you know my
life in the whole thing I later found
out that the reason why she treated me
like that is because her husband has
cheated on her with a man and they were
going through a divorce so anybody who
was gay she had a problem with so again
I didn't your husband I didn't do
anything I'm a
it still trying to figure out which way
is up and you treat me like that because
of what someone else did so regardless
of how you may feel about white people
gay people trans people black people you
can't generalize and you can't paint
everybody with the same verse because
you got an issue or you got a problem
for that specific individual let take
that to that person and she got
with or if your issue is with a group of
people who have the same issue that you
have then that's the way that you do it
you use your platform to in order to
enlighten show and change you can't
change if your ass is with
everybody else what did jay-z say I
can't help the poor if I'm one of them
so in this situation I do feel like her
cuz again that's their business no I
don't give a how y'all feel y'all
gonna all have y'all feelings in the
comments but I'm speaking from a
business standpoint if I was L'Oreal in
this bitch society cuz that's what she
acted like so this bitch decided she
wanted to have an opinion on Facebook
and do all this personal while
you're an ambassador for my
situation and then you're making my
company look bad because 90% of our
 people buy our are
white so if we go along with the
you say we're gonna use losing millions
of dollars because you got an issue
what's the that it it'll
be different if this was a situation
that the company did something to her
directly but she's a spokesperson for a
company there's a reason why certain
people don't get this opportunity
because of their mouth I probably would
never ever be a spokesperson for Mattel
as much as I love Barbie I got Barbie
houses but I don't fit the mold that is
family-friendly for kids to look at as
an example do you get what I'm saying
they used her as an example because she
represents trans youth she she
represents trans trans women and how
they're being spotlighted and treated
like everyone else and everybody has to
be the example James Charles is the
example for covergirl you see
how that turned out and she went
out of her way to say all white people
are racist I don't think the bitch
understands that your bosses are the
racist white people that you're talking
about the who owns that
created Facebook is white bitch the
are you talking about it's the same
thing that I tell y'all when I hear do
saying they don't like
but they got a Michael Kors build on I
got a Versace sure they got on giuseppe
shoes they got a Louboutin back and I'm
like who you the biggest
supporter bitch how you using the
and you hate them I don't understand
that so to me I felt like the the firing
was just she deserved that and maybe
next time she'll take her pursue her her
I want to have a moment I want to have a
point I want to make my clear well
do that and become political but don't
and I'm in and before I go let me say
this you guys have got to stop you guys
have got to stop asking companies who
prey on your insecurities to give you
some type of equality okay if a company
is telling you something that you really
don't need then therefore they can give
a about how are that whole thing I
get if you want a shade of makeup you
don't say that that represents your skin
tone because you want to buy from this
company I totally get that but this
whole will L'Oreal is they sell you
makeup okay
they're say you you trying to have a
political moment with makeup it don't
work that way they don't give a
okay if you really care that much stop
by the l'oreal products cuz the only
person that I've seen that was on
L'Oreal that was black was Beyonce
okay so again in JLo and ashamed like
she's Puerto Rican but you get what I'm
saying like somebody who wasn't white so
I don't understand why people are
shocked by what they did they're a
company
stop asking companies to care about your
feelings because they really
don't I don't think y'all get it they
don't care about how to y'all feel
about nothing okay so if you care this
much just simply stop stop asking to be
part of their narrative if that's not
what you're gonna do
there's a lot of companies
that I'll with I'll just simply
don't buy from I don't talk about it cuz
I don't care it's that simple
so yeah and then for the people who are
like well there are people who are black
because some girls stepped down and said
she don't want to work with them no more
let me say something y'all can all feel
the way that y'all want to feel about
what I'm about to say but it is what the
 it is okay if you got a problem
with what the they doing don't drag
me into it okay because what people
don't get is that a lot of these
influencers would get this opportunity
they're feeding more than just
themselves they're feeding their family
defeating their kids or catch their dogs
their pockets and some people are not
willing to say this is a big enough
issue for me to now put down my
opportunity because this mission want to
run her mouth on Facebook
no I would and I wouldn't I wouldn't
expect for nobody if I had like I said
when I did the video about oh do with
the face I said if any of y'all still
buy his products after this I love y'all
still the same because I can't tell you
what the to do with show money okay
I said him hurt him and Kim can do
whatever the she's entitled to be
friends with whoever just don't tell
nobody to get over oh but you get
I'm saying I'm not gonna tell you there
are a lot of friends that I still have
that still purchase his products I don't
look at them less than a person I just
personally don't want to hear nothing
they know they know he starts not gonna
 in bitch I'm out I already told you
but whatever you choose to do is your
business I'm tired of people trying to
tell other people how they should handle
a situation cuz you man we all gotta be
mad cuz we all look the same
no bitch because I'm actually if you
work at Target and you feel like your
boss is being a little bit on the lotta
bit on the racist side let's say that
and you housing your mama your uncle
both of your kids and your cousin you
making ends meet
you got this opportunity to be an
assistant manager and now your friend
wants to come up and say something yeah
what the he's saying is right but
at this moment I don't have time to be a
crusader for the rights of other people
to up my opportunity because the
bitch who's talking ain't gonna house me
the bitch was talking ain't gonna give
me so therefore I gotta shut up
right now and when I get into a better
opportunity to do something better and
say something to make some moves then
I'll do that
but you gotta pick your battles blue and
she picked it at the wrong time
and now what's gonna happen is every
time I'm a trans girl is considered this
bitch is gonna be the example so I'm not
saying what she's saying is wrong but
it's a time and a place and that wasn't
the time nor the place so adios
bitch that's what you get so let me know
how y'all feel below I know it's gonna
be a mess but it's fine you know I love
y'all regardless and I will catch y'all
and my next one and the review for this
hair should be up
peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
