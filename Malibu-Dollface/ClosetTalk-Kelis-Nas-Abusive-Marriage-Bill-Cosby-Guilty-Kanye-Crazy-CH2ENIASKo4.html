girl we're gonna talk about it I just
been like really my closet is clearly
dirty so you guys are getting this real
deal Holyfield right now so I came here
actually to talk about Bill Cosby's the
conviction and I also came to talk about
Khaleesi
interview with Hollywood unlocked which
I am totally obsessed with but yeah if
you guys are interested in my hair my
hair is from Rico hair if you want to
know so yeah two point so anyway Kelis
did a interview with Jason Lee um he's
the guy who threw the drink at nasal and
she talked about her career she talked
about what she's doing now and she
talked and very in-depth and very
honestly a my opinion about her
relationship with the rapper Nas her
baby's father ex-husband and I see this
often where someone is painted away and
then you guys continue to paint her in
this lane and I'm a huge kelis man and
I've watched plethora of her interviews
and this is the first time I've ever
heard her be this upfront this candid
this open this vulnerable this honest
about her relationship with Nas and the
reason why I sparked this video it has
less to do with their relationship
although that's part of it and more to
do with what climate were in right now
with children and relationships and
celebrity and all of these things
because she and in this interview she
talks about the physical and emotional
abuse that she went through with him on
both their hands because it wasn't just
she never said cuz what he just did she
said what we did we would get drunk and
we would fight each other you know I'm
saying and it wasn't she said I wouldn't
you know II like to start the fight but
I had no problem with finishing the
fight I feel you girl cuz I'm the same
way and then this interview it didn't
feel like she was lying I felt like I
was having
conversation with her about her life you
know it didn't feel like she was trying
to no longer protect the the nods name
it was more so like I'm tired of being
drug through the mud I'm tired of this
I'm tired of that so much so I mean if
you guys have time watch the interview
before you guys comment on these
headlines like on a che room and Holly
you know baller alert because what
they're gonna do is they're gonna
sensationalize one portion of it and not
talk about everything that happened and
she talks about the fact that people
believe that she makes all this money
from him and she does and she said I
just start as a 2012 started getting
eight thousand dollars a month from him
and child support and I feel like and
she does about a plethora of things and
I feel like a lot of people just be like
who needs eight thousand dollars a month
for an eight-year-old and I'm like if
you live in California and your father
is not one of the greatest rappers in
the world and your mother has one of the
most popular well a plethora of popular
songs you can't go to public school
Johnson of the street you know I'm
saying that and sometimes that is a a
semester for those kids it's like a
tuition for a college student like it's
expensive and that's not her
overspending that's her doing what's
best for her child a lot of celebrity
kids out here some of them do go to
regular school my sister was a
after-school TA for kids and she said a
lot of he's you know basketball players
daughters would end up you know here
after school but they didn't go to the
school they went to this school and then
they dropped him off here to be picked
up and it was more it was a private that
she was even doing it wasn't just
everybody sign up and it was what it was
and that's how it is I think people
forget in California is very different
and it's very expensive and you guys
know how much my ring blows you guys
probably appealing yourself you know I'm
saying you you you but I've elected to
live where I live and pay the rent that
I pay but it's no matter where I go in
LA it's going to be expensive you know
same thing in New York so when I hear
people say $8,000 is too much $8,000 is
not enough you know imagine what you're
paying with you know picking them up
dropping them off and gas which you pay
for clothes which you pay for shoes he's
a growing boy
needs this you're paying for toys you're
paying for after-school stuff your
pantry did that $8,000 is gone in a
millisecond and there's no way that she
can take that money and live in
California off of $8,000 whether she's
giving the kid money or not that's not
enough to live so let's just get that
out of the way okay cuz girl $8,000 is
like eight hundred dollars in LA I'm
telling you look it up for yourself look
how much Rin is look how much utilities
are and look how much personal bills are
it's ridiculous and she has home you
know and I'm sure she's purchased her
home she goes into all that about how
she ended up having to tour because she
had no more money because she put all
her money that she got from Europe
because you know people in Europe they
pay you in cash she's like you know I
used my cash money to put in on the
house and he would pay the mortgage so
I'll put the downpayment with my own
money and then he would pay on the
Mergen she said I came back from having
our son and the damn it was a
foreclosure notice on the fucking door
because this idiot decides he wants to
be upset with her and doesn't you know
doesn't want to pay the mortgage anymore
so she's like what do I do
I've never done this so I have to go on
tour now and release an album because he
wants to play fucking hardball that's
that's the part that I think people are
missing that part there's no empathy for
mothers who go through stuff like that
my mom was a single mother raising two
kids that are three years apart and she
had me when she was what 15 16 so it's
very difficult to raise a child figure
out where you're going police had her
son at 29 she got with knives at the age
of 22 they got married I think she was
like 24 25 you know that's a lot of your
20s you're spending with somebody and
you know what it is she never said it
was only him she said it with us
we was doing stupid shit you know which
we all do but I do have a friend and I
think I talked about this and she said
yes I'm gonna say her name and I'm you
know that whole thing but she she has a
baby with the rapper and one of the
things that Callie said that I thought
was very interesting is that she said he
makes it seem like I don't want to let
him see his son but the thing the issue
that I have is he likes to come in and
out and played out when he wants to and
I'm left to pick up the pieces when he
doesn't show up you
so if you want to be a father be a
father I have no problem with you coming
in your child's life my issue is when
you come up and you cause havoc and
ruckus and then I have to didn't explain
to this child why his father isn't
coming because you're too much of a
coward to do it so if you're not gonna
go about the rules that their primary
caretaker takes then you're gonna be out
is that simple I'm not gonna argue with
you about it I've never kept you away
from your child
and I never will she just was with him
for Thanksgiving guys like can we just
she said I literally my mother had a
stroke before Thanksgiving I feel away
she got better she felt better we had
Thanksgiving dinner and I see ice cut my
dad calm I said okay I asked my husband
my husband was like do what you got to
do it's cool she invited him after all
he's done to her and said about her and
may hurt her look she still had her and
she's up because I don't care what the
with the public thinks of me I only care
what my child thinks of me and he knows
what it is but I'm not gonna be on his
level I'm not gonna meet him where he's
at cuz he's clearly very upset you and
I'm saying she said he drinks a lot I
can believe it he said it was a volatile
volatile relationship I can believe it
you know so when you see that your
favorite rappers and actors are being
called out for the things that they do
fabulous and people don't want to
believe it because they like all he's
one of the it still can't take the fact
that he's the greatest rapper of all
times like yeah that's great and dandy
and fine and cute or whatever but it's
still you're trying to minimize her
truth because he's a fucking rapper but
what kills me is that everybody wants to
say that she's lying and in saying this
now for whatever reason when his baby
mother Carmen who wrote a book she said
the exact same thing about him and no
one blinked an eye but because if
somebody that you see who's crazy and
boisterous and all is she's the angry
black woman that's that kills me that I
that kills me I made a comment on the
shade room it was a picture of Emily B
and I said baby can you just smile for
us and I really didn't write it I didn't
write it with the intent that people
thought I was which was trying to say
can we see if your teeth are knocked out
but after people brought it to my
attention I said well I mean
well you said it's sad you got your
teeth knocked out so what's going on
here then I was accused of making fun of
a domestic violence victim and I found
that to be extremely funny because the
people who said this I've never seen
them on any of the positive black pages
that are on Instagram I only find them
on the shade room I've never seen them
on any domestic violence I've never seen
a lot of these people who are often very
active in these comments ever post
anything about domestic violence
awareness but all of a sudden they're
activists I find I find that to be
hilarious but when Terry on top of that
was that she was at Coachella with him
so you were mad at me
for a joke that I didn't even intend to
make because you're that cynical and you
think like that
and you feel that way and that's what
kills me is that you also quick to
attack one side of a story
I don't know nods like that and never
met the man a day in my life but I can
say that a lot of these actors and and
rappers that I do know and I've had
contact with they are notorious for
beating people not even women people
that they're with often okay so the fact
that she said this I'm not shocked by it
I'm just more so like of course that
makes sense you know I'm saying so if
you guys are interested in that
interview make sure you guys watch it
I'm not the hugest fan adjacently but I
will say that I did appreciate him for
this because I'm a huge police van and
she doesn't talk about this and I see
her open up and be vulnerable I think it
will help somebody you know regardless
of what you feel about her she's telling
her truth and nobody can't tell her that
her truth is wrong because she's know
this man way better than we do let's
keep that in mind so it's a Bill Cosby
kind of the same thing I feel like
people are trying to victimize the
victims and say that they are out for
the word cloud if I never hear it again
I am going to be the happiest person in
life okay they just wanted money and I'm
like it's a criminal case for my
understanding it correct me if I'm wrong
I don't believe any of them got a check
and I don't believe any of them would
wanna check and I think what people are
missing is they're saying well they went
up to the room with him whether they
think was gonna happen true indeed
just some groupies trying to get off and
say that I slept with Bill Cosby in the
70s a lot of people do it but what you
guys are missing which is the point
which is if I go to a room with you I
don't want to drink something and then I
have no control over what I say yes and
no - that's the point that you guys are
missing you can't use me and then do
what you want with me and I'm inebriated
and then expect for me to be completing
and say oh he's Bill Cosby he's cliff
Huxtable which he ain't that the same
people okay you can do what you want
with me because you have money you know
you use your pocketbook and that's what
kelis was saying about nods he uses his
money as leverage in order to be right
when he knows he's wrong so today when I
seen whoa it was yesterday and I think
these women come out and they embrace
each other and they hug and they're
crying they're crying because it's a
relief it's a relief when you're able to
tell you you get vindicated for
something that happened to you that's
why when people say well why is Calliste
speaking now I didn't know there was a
time period in in in you know a
hourglass on when it was time for you to
tell your truth okay sometimes just
because something happens at that moment
you don't always want to talk about it
and for me as a person I've been through
that there's things that I've never
talked about with people and then I
finally sat down and said it to them and
they're shell-shocked that I've been
able to function through a lot of stuff
that I've been through personally after
certain things have happened to me and
it's not because I'm ready to talk about
it you can't tell me what my truth is
and you can't tell me when I should and
shouldn't say something you know or when
I should and shouldn't speak up all
these women wanna come out and now speak
out the thing is this is not a new
situation and if y'all just didn't use a
shave women baller alert and in shit on
Instagram and blogs to be your source
material for what things are going on in
the world then you would understand that
this has been a long time so then you
want people who don't want to bring up
or Harvey Weinstein he's still out ain't
nobody did nothing for him whoa his
career is pretty much over
okay and just like Bill Cosby situation
it takes time to get to a court you
don't go to court you don't do something
today and then be in court tomorrow you
stupid asses so when I hear people say
stupid stuff like that and say well why
is it because it's because Bill Cosby is
a black man not realizing that this man
has violated somebody violate women okay
you're not understanding that point the
only thing that you're looking at is
this Bill Cosby and you're thinking
about pudding and shit think about if
this was your child not your daughter
not your son your child that you've
birthed into this world that did
something stupid and they got violated
from that would you say well girl this
Bill Cosby what are you teaching your
kids are you teaching your kids don't
put your hands on me unless you got
money is that what you're saying because
if that's is is that what you're telling
your kids then the world is already
fucked okay we got nine year olds
talking about you your mama's a hoe and
you got bad buddy so I'm not this hope
is going children or knowing our future
at this point but you think that
irritates me and aggravates me is that
you have people blaming people for
something that they did it it's not
their fault you're blaming the victim
for what someone else did and not seen
but which I fail to realize is y'all
want to talk about he's a black man
y'all should've listened our Kelly on
tape doing it we have the girl's name
and identity we have the date of the
tape his face in the tape we have girls
coming out from a fucking bumper up and
even fucking Chicago liquor store saying
that they have been held captive even
though I don't feel like I said oh you
can be held captive but mine tricks are
something in it clearly he's good at
this marriage certificates and he has
not seen a fucking jail cell yet okay so
all it is is this it's not a race issue
and I'm tired of y'all trying to make
this a fucking race issue it's a right
or wrong issue okay if you do something
wrong and you do the crime you're gonna
pay the time and Bill Cosby thought he
was never gonna have to pay the time for
the shit that he's done to this women
and guess what mr. Huxtable sit yo ass
in cell block eight by and I don't care
what no one says if it was my child if
it was my grandmother if it was anybody
wrong as wrong as right is right it
doesn't matter is the system crooked yes
do we need to change some shit yes but
you cannot sit back and say because this
happened to this person in this
should get off scot-free because this
that we're not gonna do that we're not
gonna do that this man pretty much
admitted that he did if I did something
to you I'm sorry
that's a narcissistic asshole who has no
motherfucking regards for human beings
period and what you guys have to
remember is that celebrities okay listen
to what I'm telling you guys celebrities
feel like they are gods and their money
gets them out of a lot of pickles
it took how many women to take this man
down how many years to take this man
down
imagine all the other assholes who are
in Hollywood who are doing this I'm sure
there should give now but if you're
sending your children to Hollywood and
you're putting them in hands of people
like Bill Cosby be forewarned that they
might come back to you one day as a
parent and tell you about the fucked up
shit that they went to because you left
them to the wolves are you told them not
to say nothing or you told your daughter
to go get what a fucking rapper so she
can secure her future instead of put
giving her the correct shit to do as a
woman to stand on her own two feet and
never have to lay on her back to do
anything okay Emily chose to be with
fabulous she's also choosing to stay in
that situation okay but I don't want to
hear no sympathy for her because she is
allowing herself to be taken advantage
of by somebody that she says loves her
he loved what he can do to her he loves
what he can get out of her she's like an
old bean bag she's very comfortable for
him okay Chrissy then what Kim Bella's
asked because she said that her and
fabulous mother fucking touch knees on
the bus she whooped her ass because
Emily couldn't do that and I don't know
cook I don't condone fighting and I like
Kim Bella but that ass weapon was
warranted bitch cuz you don't never tell
another bitch we shouldn't deal but they
must fuck him and expect her to sit
there so she's lucky Chrissy was there
okay so I don't feel bad for Emily but I
do feel bad for women like her and I
have empathy for her I don't feel bad
for her I have empathy for her situation
so remember everybody that's going
through a situation they speak when they
fucking want to it's a lot of yah who
are watching this video right ma the
fucking there they got secrets that are
so deep
she probably will never tell nobody
because you either too ashamed you don't
want to talk about it or you're
embarrassed and that's okay and but
don't go off with those feelings and
tell somebody else girl what took you so
long and say something bitch because I
was living on mother fucking life and I
don't want to be fucking stuck there
that's what the fuck happened so not to
get too deep into it but all I'm saying
is I don't like victim shaming I really
don't like that shit pisses me off
especially when people do it to children
and women because those are the two
people that people try to so bad you
want to devalue them and then put
somebody on a pedestal because they
would have wrote a fucking song about it
Jeep
you really think this motherfucker you
would you would you leave your kids
around or Kelly that's the fucking
question and you have kids put that shit
below it hit the like button while you
at it and if you don't like what I'm
saying hit the dislike button why you
edit would you leave your kids with our
Kelly unsupervised with no cameras yo 14
and 15 yard daughter would you just cuz
you like his song and you think the pipe
hype hyper is so cute and he made good
motherfucking sex music would you so say
what you want about whoever the
situation is make people accountable for
their fucking actions it's that simple
it's cut and dry so this video is
getting long but I know I can get you on
one in two minutes but I want out I just
want to give y'all something to think
about celebrities are people too they
have feelings too they go through shit
too and this is why I'm not gonna sit up
here and go at Kanye like that because
he's clearly need some help and the fact
that y'all stood up here laughing at
this man y'all think it's funny when he
ends up dead I want to see how many
y'all chuckling now because the same
motherfuckers that was talking about
meek wasn't shit or talking about
welcome home we love you he ain't taking
no ills no more pick a side pick a wall
boots pick a wall and I will catch y'all
in my next one okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
