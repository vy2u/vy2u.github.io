story behind why I've been gone just now
I'm working very hard on some special so
that's why I've been a little distant a
little distant a lot of distances long
two weeks but just know that I'm doing
something that's taking up a lot of my
time but it's a lot of reviews coming so
some worries um but I wanted to come and
do this video because coz there's a lot
going on and entertainment people people
got fiery dicks people don't quit loving
hip-hop so I'm going to now start this
segment on my channel called closet talk
which I will be in my closet just
talking and shooting off really no
makeup or maybe getting ready in here
telling guys my opinions about stuff
that's going on and social media in the
media period and the world of
entertainment and I've done this like I
started my channel doing this and then I
stopped doing it so I kind of want to
just kind of go back to this especially
during the summer time just kind of
what's going on
now I don't know how fast these videos
on the out girl and like this one is
gonna be compiled of more than one
subject so here we go this might be a
lengthy one so get comfortable the first
thing that I do want to talk about is
because I kept getting messages about
people being very upset that Kylie
Jenner got a wax figure and our great
late alia does not have collect figure
and a lot of people were trying to
justify and say why this was it and it
didn't make sense and to me it made a
whole lot of sense you know so I wanted
to touch on this because I think as fans
a lot of times people feel slighted or
still like why this and not this or this
person did it message so I'm going to
break it down to y'all so that it all
just makes complete sense I'm just going
to say I'm not a fan of Kylie Jenner but
I don't have anything against Kylie
Jenner either I don't really understand
why she gets to hate that she gets like
some people I am like Jeffrey star for
instance I understand why people would
dislike him for her I don't understand
people dislike her other than the fact
that she came from a family with not the
greatest reputation and a
been able to sustain and make a life off
of being themselves and a lot of people
said whatever how many talents well
they're the American dream is to be able
to just sustain and live life a great
life without doing anything and that's
exactly what she does but she's
cultivated that into a actual business
now whether you agree with it or not
she's still a brand so it goes back to
the wax figure which is Madame Tussaud
is a company who makes wax museums and
have been doing it for eons of years of
celebrities at the moment and that or
not realistic at the moment there are
legendary iconic or whatever Kim got her
years ago and I personally feel like the
wax figure didn't look shit like Kim
just like their Beyonce's one don't look
like which I'm confused as to why people
are so up in arms about this particular
Beyonce one because the ship's been up
for years they just changed the bitch
clothes and but that rest figure has
been there looking like Jessica Simpson
since dangerously and so I don't ok um
wait here's why alia did does not have a
or here's my theories I'll say I'm not
going to say for a fact like I know cuz
I don't but this is why she doesn't have
a wax figure because her family most
likely will not say yes to that okay
just like I'm sure her family is not
going to say yes to this matte
collection that you guys want her to
have or and I do - don't think you guys
I'm gonna say I do too but what you guys
have to also understand is the fact that
although we're fans and it is been years
since she's gone her family does not
necessarily see her as alia the singer
or the trendsetter
she was alia the daughter she was alia
duster but the person that we see her
asked as opposed to her family is
completely different and what you guys
also have to understand and realize
which I don't know it was somebody I
don't know if it was Michael Jackson or
if it was Biggie's mom it was one of the
tubes but they both have I think Michael
got like his whole every knows he had
gotta figure and there they put him
around the world and I think Gaga also
has the same difference and um she
didn't want to look at it you know her
son has been gone
for years and she was like I don't
really want or somebody that I really
don't want to look too added too hard
because if you guys have never been to
like the wax museum the shit is freaky
okay myself IV here on YouTube and Jada
from Prince Harry Shaw we went years ago
and it was freaky to be like Selena
Gomez is the one I remember specifically
being the creepiest because it looked
just like her and they look like they
just standing and they're gonna just
jump out but Tinker House of Wax because
that's kind of how would it remind you
of um
the Rihanna one we took pictures with
and she looks just like I've seen
Rihanna in person she looks just like
everything from the eyelashes everything
is so creepy so imagine somebody that
you love passes away and then we
immortalize them and the last time you
seen them so let's just say Memphis oh
say yes we want to give her a wax figure
and we want to do one of them we want to
do a J number the number one a million
in the last hour and we'll put them in
LA Tokyo in New York so when you go and
imagine just keep yourself in their
shoes you go and this is your grandpa
this is your sister yes and this can
other you know your brother cousins that
passed away and they take that damn
sheet down it's like looking at that
person again in all of those feelings
gives you stuff so I think that's kind
of the reason why her family has been so
tight-lipped on allowing her legacy to
progress like I would have wanted to be
like don't get me wrong there's a fan
I'm very frustrated with a lot of stuff
I do
surviving had to use an example Selena's
family has done a great job with keeping
her legacy alive with the Matt campaign
and you guys know last year I had did a
thing on Instagram where I'm like if you
sign a petition for her to her own wax
figure I will follow you even though
people charge you for photos which i
think is really wet but okay trying to
do my thing I think sometimes a lot of
the fans look to me because I have a
larger platform so I have a long reach
to say and do certain things to get
things done which I'm always here open
to do but I'm also very realistic about
a lot of things and I feel like a lot of
the reasons why we haven't got a Matt
campaign or waxing yours
because our state is not going to sign
off on that and we could sign petitions
and talk as much shit as we want into
those the jaws of all of us fall out but
if her face says no the Mac nor Madame
Tussaud can do shit about it because
that's against the law so then you take
somebody like Kylie Jenner who has
regardless of what we feel about alia
Kylie Jenner is right now and Kylie
Jenner and the Kardashian name sells so
what do they want to do they're going to
give her one because all these little
girls are going to come with their lip
kits and their lips looking like stupid
to take pictures with the plastic wax
Kylie and I'm not mad at it you don't
say it's a I think a lot of us have to
start to realize that no matter how much
you love a person if things are being
done it's still a business when you see
j.lo and Beyonce and a lawyer commercial
they're not doing it for the love of the
project they're doing it because they
can charge as much as they want and be
brand loyal to a brand like L'Oreal who
will make them look amazing and put them
on all these boxes and get a nice amount
of money for it's still a business so
when a lot of times we look at things
let me get upset about certain things
you have to understand this our business
side to this - and her family may feel
like they don't look at her as a
business we don't want to have people
and that accessible to her so therefore
we're not going to do that we don't want
to do that I would like it I'm a person
just like a lot of you guys who never
got to meet her this will be the closest
thing for us to be able to meet her in
this lifetime
okay and her family may feel like we
don't want her that accessible to people
and I feel like and when you are a
person like us and what I'm seeing what
I've read celebrities and their teams
get a chance to give you every single
thing a lot of pho that these they wear
our actual outfits that these
celebrities have worn or they've been
reconstructed to look just like the
original outfits I know a lot of Gaga
stuff is her original stuff so they'll
go you know to the nail now Kim and
Beyonce's are the tools to me that look
the least like them but when they were
actually in wax before they were painted
and I make more put on they look just
like the person
it's just been Salomon stuff a lot of
times throw shit off bleh
um and they should be wrong for the
Beyonce because I'm telling you that is
so Jessica's enzyme yeah it is one of
those things where we as fans have got
to stop pointing the finger and say well
Kylie Jenner doesn't deserve one in the
lead deserves one but the reason why I
did probably is getting one is because
her team said let's go for it and Elise
team said no so you can't be upset at
the person who got it over the person
who did it now all this is speculated
this is not factual I don't know but I
do feel like a lot to me it's a
double-edged sword because I understand
the fact that this is a purse this was a
real person with a real family and had a
real impact on people on the other hand
she's also a real artist that I really
look up to an hour really idolized and
will never get to me and I would like to
have something like that for me as a
person so I see both sides of the table
and as fans you can't really point a
finger too much at other people because
sometimes it's in it it's a in housing
as opposed to an external thing and as
much as we love our Lea Kylie Jenner has
millions of followers who were going to
golf and shot from Tokyo to New York to
LA to go take a picture with a hunk of
of wax that was perfected by a doctor
and I ain't mad at it so yeah I'll
that's all I'll say about that but just
think about that and stop coming at Polo
Kylie Sheehan do nonetheless she really
didn't she have anything she said she
liked her so let's let's let's let the
girl live okay the next persistence we
all the subjective alia is fucking our
Kelly now I don't know if you guys know
okay I am NOT a fan of our Kelly in the
least bit okay
I don't like his music they're only our
Kelly song that I fucked with a flow
line
now that is a jam that's a pop like a
motherfucker God let us fuck in a club
especially when I'm drunk but I'm not a
fan of him I'm not ever understood what
the hype was in my opinion about our
Kelly I've always looked at him as a
predator I've never looked at him as a
artist and I want to try to look at him
at the artist it just was weird is he
always work you know what I'm doing
Eliot first album I don't listen to that
album a lot because he's heavily
influenced oh by the way I just want to
say that I'm not a friend of our kilee
as an artist but he wrote some jams for
B bouquet and y'all know I love you too
k so just take this whatever and is all
okay go ahead on that album such as the
other day I was on the way to the store
and there's a song I forgot because I
got album is very touch-and-go for me
but at the beginning of the song is a
list you're the only one and that I said
nope yeah that's weird
she was 15 she was 14 15 there's no
reason why you'd be talking I get you a
producer but even when Sean Garrett did
teairra Marie though he was talking
about hear less fuss like no it was
weird he was given a sense what I was
saying
but anyway to our Kelly he apparently
has a sex cult with six women that
currently reside in his home one of the
girls got loose and she pretty much said
that she has to act to use the bathroom
she had to be um she had acts you the
bathroom bathe eat wear hair certain way
sleep that's pretty much what it is like
a modern-day cult of him with women and
a lot of these girls are yup they're
they're like 21 and they've been in this
cult since they were 18 17 type of
things they run away from home some of
these girls just left on the left on it
all some of the parents on give a fuck
it just depends but the thing will are
Kelly and this is there's a lot of y'all
Chris Brown fans about to just hate me
right now but a lot of people with Chris
Brown and Bill Cosby is that they still
make excuses for these people who have a
clear pattern of doing certain things
let it be Chris Brown's anger let it be
our chilly with young girls you know let
it be Bill Cosby with all these people
now with Bill Cosby I don't think that
all who came forward it actually
happened as a lot of people however go
Cosby is quite the old man so it could
be true but I still feels like where
there's smoke there's fire
and everybody that we're talking about
was put on a pedestal to be such a great
person to this community of black people
and when they do wrong because you don't
want your heroes to look scorned you
just brush it under the rug is the same
thing as when uncle will molest someone
in the family and the mom will always
have her babies back no matter who was
hurt
that's what I see in this situation
because he married Aliya
and he was able Leah never she said that
they were never married there is an
interview that I will link below that is
here on YouTube where a guy had asked
Ali about this and he said Ari were you
married or are you married to our Kelly
and her response is man you are so late
I'm like I just have to ask you go now
because like the fans they know none of
me like my fans I love you thank you for
supplying me they know but you need to
get like an old vibe that's in the life
right and sick of the bowl
it was her way of saying yes it happened
I'm not married anymore or less to move
on from it
but it was true they were married and
even though it wasn't legal because he
lied about her age he's still married a
15 year old and at the time I think our
telly was like 27 something like that so
that alone and finding interest in girls
that are that young and I did see the
sex tape with that underage girl and it
was him I don't know fuck how many times
you want to say to the brother no never
it was you okay we have evidence of this
man peeing on young adolescent girls
but when happy to take oh come on
everybody forgets that when I believe I
can fly
it's sung at graduations for adolescents
which i think is a little weird because
I spun that shit at my fifth grade
graduation by the way nobody remembers
these things and I did you can separate
the artist from his work but this is one
of those things where it's not like
Michael Vick where he was you know even
though I think brutality of animals is
disrespectful it's not the same thing
because these are innocent children who
are being preyed upon by older men and
it's it's it's weird it's just what I
don't there's nothing that 15 year old
could do for me like arrow but get the
fuck out my face but he clearly has an
issue and I feel like in my opinion this
is just a long time coming you get what
I'm saying like this is not something
that is new with our Kelly this is not a
revelation that we just heard about so
he says that he is shocked in something
I said he must have been shocked and
whatever the fuck he said since 94 cuz
nigga this is not the first time we have
heard about this and throughout the year
and I've definitely heard things about
him still messing with underage girls
and boys but you know bumping grind and
slow windows and listening to those
record even flow might even was my jam
it just weird to listen to because he
maybe he wrote this or senses what a
whole different intent people okay
you were mommy of my G was it a Barbie
James legs no was it a power we like
it's weird
so then the last person we're going to
talk about is Diablo
take us sure okay cuz so I was trying
not to talk about this but girlfriend
pretty quick so our allegation well not
allegations but there is some documents
that came out of uh sure and usher had
had sex with this girl week was too meek
Manteca his ex-wife Fosters slept with
her before the wedding in it after the
wedding I mean like the wedding day but
like before the marriage and after the
marriage doubt the correct way to say
that and um she it was revealed that she
got herpes from him and he supposedly
contracted herpes between 2009 and 2010
and it's very graphic that there was a
greenish discharge that came from his
penis now I don't know if any of you
have ever seen um cabin fever - but one
of the boys in there has sex with one of
the girls who has like the virus that's
in the water and his penis has a green
is Claud it's just like watching
somebody pop up hemp is so nasty but
apparently she seen this and still
decided to have unprotected sex with him
so a my opinion girl you got what you
got I mean listen if you see their car
as a smacking dog don't run yo ass out
there to it thinking they gonna smack
you just saying girl but um just as
today when I was gonna let this boy read
another woman who is seeking 10 million
dollars of machinery Nezumi know she
might get like five but she's saying
that she also contracted earlier this
year okay so in the last leg about seven
months within the last seven months he
dipped that thing up in her and gave her
of the fiery breathe to I mean dead dick
is hot and it's really late well first
off he cheated on grace his old ass wife
um but you're doing it unprotected like
you don't care you you don't care now
that kind of an HIV easily you know I'm
saying
but yeah it's incurable but the girls on
she has leash
in in pains and aches and her vagina
like her pussy is gone okay and she
can't even go and have babies with
nobody else because she could possibly
give it to her her partner and her baby
might be blind like girl our next one
media one of these motherfuckers how you
baby out here like Rachel so I don't
fucking know and I don't want to see if
you wonder baby ain't nothing wrong with
it but if you can prevent it don't do it
so uh sure
strap it up and you don't need worth a
cool 180 million not after these bitches
keep coming up on top how many other
bitch attina put some hot sauce on how
many other tacos have you spread to
Diablo on cuz that's nasty
okay um our Kelly I hope he gets the
fire chamber and as far as eyelid wax
figure is concerned
don't stop your support for her and
don't stop your support for Kylie if you
love Kylie understand there are people
in the world who think Kylie of God and
they love everything that she does and I
don't feel that way but I can't be mad
at them for feeling that way because
there's a motherfucker I love that
people could care less about so I hope
you guys enjoyed this I'll be back for
more videos actually starting tomorrow
