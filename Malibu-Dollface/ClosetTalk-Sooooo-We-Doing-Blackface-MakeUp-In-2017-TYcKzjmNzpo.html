after our last little powwow here
applause it talked but you know people
like that ignorant so I had to talk
about it and it's because and and I'm
gonna say this nicely and artists say
and makeup artists decided that he
wanted to do blackface you know and I
told you guys that I have a video coming
up called
about sensitivity which I stated in my
last video which it's ready to go up and
I was gonna upload it today but then
this came about I wanted to talk that to
make a point here okay so I'm not gonna
put the artist name and I won't show his
face I will block out his eyes I just
want you to see the contrast of what he
did so he went from spoiled milk to
jay-z and thought that it was okay okay
so I'm gonna read you the comment in
which he he put now mind you this person
has now deleted the original post and or
maybe Instagram deleted it not sure who
deleted what but it was reposted on his
page and he said oh yeah says this post
is unavailable because it was deleted
now again I don't know who deleted it I
don't know if it was him or was because
people on Instagram were reporting it
not really sure but I will say that I
find it to be ridiculously disgusting
and there's other things that go along
with this as well
so he decided that he wanted to post
this on his page and he wrote this
caption so he decided to put I'll just
do this so this is what it looks like oh
oh he tagged he he he he's looking for a
moment okay so we're gonna do this so
this is what he looked like after he did
what he did and he posted white to dark
okay not white to black not
light to dark white to dark okay now I
could be reading more into this but
we're gonna continue it says I love all
skin colors and this look is inspired
from it that we all are beautiful so he
tagged Mac enthusiam body Nicki Minaj
don't know what that got to do with
anything
NYX deci oh another stunt Queen okay now
in them in the video he decides that he
wants to put on a whole bunch of dark
makeup and make herself look as if he
was probably darker than me okay now he
looks like spoiled milk okay he's not
attractive if you say I'm bullying him
or whatever the situation is no I'm
making a point here to say that whether
you are black or white
you're still not cute okay no matter how
much makeup you wore you're still not
cute not only on the outside but in the
inside as well because what people have
to understand is this there's a reason
why blackface is offensive okay I don't
care about what part of the world you're
from we all got this thing called the
Internet this is what brings you guys to
my closet okay so the internet is made
for more than just Instagram it's
actually made for educational purposes
as well so if you're gonna use the
Internet make sure you use it with all
of your the might you can in order to
make this make sense he has 21 point 4 K
on Instagram okay so he's looking for
mom because I went to his page and all
of his videos are pretty boring and they
all look like typical you know things
that you will see online and to be just
100 with you he looks like a white chick
the way he can't I don't know if it's
because of how light he naturally is he
has very um this you know like a white
chicks they just have this very pity
didn't look like the the Wilson sisters
they look like humans they just had this
very false look to them that's what he
once he contours his nut nose he just
looks like a male white chick so he
decided to post this and in a lot of
people and I'm when I say a lot of
people when the person the couple of
people will send it to me there were
thousands of comments saying that you
should die you're disrespectful how is
this okay you're just looking for a
moment your stunt Queen your this year
this year this yeah and I'm just trying
to figure out how he thinks this is okay
so I'm like okay we did this and I'm
gonna try to give him the benefit of the
doubt due to the simple fact that people
are it seems as if he's from another
country I don't know not really sure you
know I gotta use Instagram though he
knows how to you can put fucking white
to black so he knows something about
English so when the person sent it to me
they noticed that he was liking some
very not so nice tweets I mean our
Instagram comments now Jim's truth
decide he wanted to get in here and have
a moment but James Charles don't get no
no fuck if you wonder who he is googling
but I don't he's another stunt Queen
that needs to go sit his ass down cuz
he's a little pretentious over it but
anyway he decided to write to the boy
thank you for giving the rest of us that
a bad name your ignorance and racism is
truly horrifying so he responded to what
James said and said I'm in shock how
public people want to support this hate
for PR yourself for PR you're okay this
is wrong not my work by Ed James Charles
and put a fuck you emoji now this boy
put this on his story and use a black
emoji for the fuck you so I'm just like
okay bitch so then I go back to the
message and I'll put there should be
popping somewhere up on the damn sky
like a drama channel right now oh okay
I Love You patty page so this is his
response and what oh the woman of color
said about him she said something she
said something to him about what he did
which was probably you're an asshole for
doing this and his somebody replied in
his defense and
sad and you look like a burnt nigger
heart of picking cotton he liked that
comment okay so my whole thing is this
if you are a person who is a different
ethnicity and you decide to do something
for instance I did a look that was
inspired well then it wasn't inspired it
was a Wednesday Addams look okay and in
that look Jenai did my makeup okay so I
did the ponytails like Wednesday I did
the skull I did all of that stuff but I
didn't change the color of my skin I was
still black when all was said and done
I've seen a lot of people do a lot of
things I've been a lot of Barbies in my
life for Halloween for just everyday
life when Miss Kino did all of these
Barbie looks they had models of every
color some of the looks that I decided
to purchase did not have women of color
that doesn't mean or men of color that
doesn't mean that I have to go a light
in my skin to do so the most that I
wanted to do and that wasn't change my
eye color and my hair color so it could
be cohesive with what the look was but
I'm not changing my skin color I'm very
happy with the skin color that I have if
I was gonna do a Miller middle-eastern
look I probably wouldn't darken my skin
when I do do blonde hair I tend to wear
much more bronzer just so that I do look
darker and there's a contrast between my
skin and my hair you know I think people
have to be understanding that is still a
sensitive subject for people now you
guys know I'm the first person to tell
somebody that they overreacted to
something that's so fucking stupid but
in this situation this was bullshit and
he deserves his ass whupped for doing
this now I don't like I said I don't
know who deleted it I don't know if it
was him or Instagram he goes back and
post a picture again I'm opposed to
video again and he puts the same caption
and cuts off the first probably five
comments on his Instagram and that just
goes to show that you're doing this to
be a stunk when you're just looking any
you just feel like any press it is
pressed at this point because me doing
these very basic contour looks are not
working so what could I do
that would be you know shocking that
would make the situation what it is
and it's this and I just feel like
people are doing way too much for
Instagram lights you're not getting any
money off of this none of these
companies are gonna work with you
because you're a fucking liability now
you're known for being a racist makeup
artist and you guys know in my video I
expect people use the word too loosely
that's racist but in this situation he
liked a very racially charged comment
I guess the woman of color who was
offended by his blackface
that is what you call racist when
somebody tells you that you doing
something wrong that's offending them as
a culture that you don't belong to if
shit even if you belong to them and you
don't see past yourself that's the
problem no you guys know I'm an equal
opportunist you fuck with me I fuck with
you black white Indian Asian man white
woman a bitch of the bitch a
disrespectful ho is a disrespectful ho a
no-good dude is universal okay no good
man black white Orange
Nick we could look like we and a dog
okay and girl okay but then to top it
off to just add insult to injury he put
in a grill then proceeded to play rake
it up break it up by Yo Gotti
and use the verse where he saying nigga
like 85 times he like I'm gonna used a
clip cuz I want you to know what I'm
posed to be lookin and that's where the
problem that I have because there was a
similar issue that happened recently
where a young lady did a look that was
inspired by Valentina from RuPaul's Drag
Race and she put a spin on the look and
she did it as um like I think her name
is a windy or all I know is her attitude
is bad allegedly and she did is it where
she has symmetrical vitiligo okay now I
have known a lot of people my cousin has
a bit of like oh one of my friends
Nicole used to have it up on her I it
went away I don't know why but it went
away but when I first met her in the
sixth grade she had vitiligo up under
her eye and I think on her arm and
eventually as we got older
just went away but she never understood
as to why then you know so I understand
what it is and I feel like she did it in
a very positive
self-promoting you know in a very beauty
is beauty type of way as a makeup art
and she did a great job like she did an
amazing job people were offended by that
now the reason why I wasn't offended and
what the two differences is he was like
well it says it's a skin I don't I said
but she didn't do it in a way where she
she didn't do herself like that and say
look how disgusting I look or look how
bad I look she said I think this look is
beautiful this was my reference and this
was my reference so in that situation I
did feel like people were being
hypersensitive
for no reason she didn't do anything
wrong if her intent was bad I understand
you know or she said oh I I will I ever
get a man like this or some shit like
that
then it's offensive to people who have
dealt with this situation but because
vitiligo has become such a it's become
common to see on people like freckles
and stuff like that now speaking of
freckles shit people who draw on their
Franco their freckles turns truth should
they now not be able to do that because
gingers are now offended should people
not be able to wear afros now because
clowns and black people are like you
know what where is the line of because I
don't I don't feel like there's oh if
you're doing something wrong you're
doing something wrong and if you do
something wrong you should be very aware
of what you're doing you get what I'm
saying like I would never do something
and not think about it like how will
people react to it if I came on here and
I did a burn makeup and then I said oh
my god I look disgusting
and then people who are for burn victims
are gonna be a thing about what I just
said you get what I'm saying so it's a
way to do things they do burn makeups
all the time on YouTube for Halloween
and everything else but if you say I'm
gonna play a victim and now Dan you're
offending people who struggle from that
so for you to go ahead and say I love
all colors and this is a woman and then
you do a caricature of what a black man
would be
and he gotta be a rapper with a grill
that's a nigga that got a you know I'm
saying is it just people we're in very
sensitive times and I do agree that a
lot of stuff that people want to deem
racist is not racist in this situation
he was stupid he was dumb he was
disrespectful
he was immature and he needs a really
good checking I'm not going to put his
name in this video if you want to go to
Instagram and find it fine y'all do what
y'all want in these comments but I am
NOT gonna promote the reason why I
wanted to even talk about this situation
is because this is why people of color
have issues with other people because
then you see someone do something like
this and they they find no issue with it
they don't have a sensitivity bone and I
don't believe that one person fucks it
up for everybody else because
everybody's you know gay people are from
askew is they suck dick enough I don't
do that okay and don't put me with John
Jim Paul Raggedy Andy
none of them cuz I don't do that so I
don't like when people paint me with the
same brush and these thought I asked
motherfucking grinder hoes about of here
I don't do that but again I understand
why people believe that because the
stereotype is so you know it's just
repetitive and you see people do stuff
and say I don't know why y'all mad is
you you can't not do that you garan I'm
saying a joke is a joke that's not a
joke okay so what's the difference I get
you to Center that's fo two scenarios um
the young lady with the vitiligo well I
feel like she did an amazing job
and then you got this idiot over here
who looks like he don't even know how to
properly fucking blend out anything and
I don't know so let me know y'all y'all
comments below I was about to finish
editing my review for my pink hair and
then and then upload my other one but
anyway let me know how y'all feel about
this I do you feel this offensive or do
you feel no problem with it
keep it posted let me know I will put
patty pages page down below cuz that's
my girl
and and I will catch y'all in my next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
