a hit I've partnered with closure store
to give away three yes three different
sub base closures that they have on
their site I usually wear the Russian
one but they have different options for
anyone who's looking for something maybe
a little bit different but this is only
for the Stoke base no lace so we're
going to give away three so here are the
rules one make sure that you follow me
and close your store Instagram at Malibu
doll face in that closure store then you
make sure that you repost this photo
that you see right now on your screen on
Instagram it should currently be on my
profile as well as their profile at us
and you repost it make sure you use
hashtag MDF silk based giveaway enter up
to two times and one day international
accounts are ok but no giveaway accounts
they will be blocked winners will be
chosen randomly on May fourth but not
announced until May seventh on my
account as well as their account so
remember you can only enter up to two
times a day so good luck to you guys I
hope you guys are going to enjoy this
they have the best closures on the
planet and I will see you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
