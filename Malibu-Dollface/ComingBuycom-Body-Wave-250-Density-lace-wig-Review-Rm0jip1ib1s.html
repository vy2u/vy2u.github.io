have got rainy glory album
I think it's let me down anyway thought
I'd rather that I don't know I love that
note even though it's terrible it's my
favorite so my hair let me get close so
you can see that my issues Baloo and it
did not come to me breakfast
it's coming by and I will give you guys
expect now my hair did not come blue and
it did not come cut like this I do this
myself so this is their full a slash
later on this is the lace front
and this is not a whole last week so
what that means is there are tracks here
in the back and then all this in the
front is uh is lace now when you hear
lace haka don't wanna do when I hear
lakefront it doesn't usually um I think
about what we look like when training
them first are wearing line lace wig and
if you like this much a pardon so they
will have to color like doodle but call
them over and it's terrible it's not
that it's a lot of party all that is
that you see is all the party space that
comes with this wig okay so you guys
know it comes with this in between the
lady that it came with to again with two
of these and then it also came with it's
like a receipt to let you know that
everything in your order is correct and
to let you know that if you do not like
just um you're going to send your unit
back just make sure you have seven days
if you divide and you don't like you
have seven days and sent it back and I
give them a little questionnaire right
here as to why you don't like it send a
pretty hot second since I got this puppy
so I don't remember everything off the
wrist this is a it was twenty-two inches
when I initially got it right now I'm
probably looking about a fourteen and
how I cut it and then it's a color
I cannot read this hair right in the
same my life but it was a 1b some other
stuff down here they just don't like I
don't know
sorry some of that can y'all make our
decision the restaurant okay so um what
I did was I went ahead and cut this
where you was I have a video coming on
how I did cut this because I started my
other one then you guys really wanted to
know what I use to cut my hair so evenly
and I don't use scissors I even want to
do girl puppies which is this is a
Conair mm-hmm let it up so these are
really different people who are not a
precision cutting plus it makes your job
much easier so what I went ahead to do
and cut it evenly because I wanted
something that was different it was like
the rig is nice but I'm just like the
length was just very okay like I could
really do anything different with it I
didn't want to have to bleach all of
this hair so I sit there by myself I use
my VW bleach excuse me
pretty developer on this hair and then I
use a color by a door called Navy like I
think it's like royal navy I believe
that's what it's called and I used it on
this particular wig so what I do with
the assistance of my phone here so you
guys can see because I also like the
color is coming off as bright as it is
even though it's a really dark color and
I've got some of the spots in his hair I
didn't do it all one like 6:13 I did you
like in level so that when I put the
color on top someone would still have my
a darker color and then someone will be
sore would also like just a blue Smurf
situation so this little um this not
really hoping but you got you can
definitely see the color variance that's
going on here in the hair its depth is
all definitely blue that's what the hell
it is
and it took color so well I was going to
reach it again and I just decided
against that but as you can see my hair
is still flowy and you can see they
should now here's a trick for you guys
what you guys want to you want to take a
wig or some hair and you plan if you
plan to cut it what you can do is a lot
of times the other bears rule the
coloring you have to go a half an inch
away from the scalp to the ends and then
when you go back to you know and do it
again another
later you go to the ends through the
ends because you don't want to over
process the roots and you don't want to
over process the ends if you plan on
cutting your hair when I did cut it and
I'll put a picture of what how long it
was when I first cut it about cutting
while before I put any color in it and
the reason why I did that is because I
wanted to be able to cut this and show
what it would look like before I
actually put color on it which you have
to see that the cut was the same it was
longer so what you do is you cut if you
want your hair let's just say you want
it to be here then you will cut the hair
originally whatever length it is and
it's too long you cut it here and then
you go ahead and bleach it and then to
favor on bleaching time only do this if
you plan it's up to them if you plan to
cut it altered you don't want to go
trough don't do this then just go
straight from the ends straight half an
inch away from the south through the
ends and just let it process it's not
all the process the ends but what you
can do is go ahead and cut it off so
then what I did was now I have these
nice healthy ends and I didn't have to
go through these extra applications or
something that I just really really
didn't want to sit through so they there
are there's a comb here in the back
uh-huh there's a chrony on the back and
there's two combs on each side here this
particular wig does not have because it
is not for late it doesn't have lace
here in the back it's like a cat piece
so you can't really put this up in a bun
if you wanted to this wouldn't be the
one to do this with I would suggest
doing this with like a four legs or even
if this is a 360 and it is trucks in the
middle but this is like really a tab
right here where the comb is in and
that's it on the lace with a breeze to
bleach the actual hair itself and when I
receive the unit it didn't require me to
do any plucking and I'm so happy that
companies are realizing that sending
units in the frontal is already pre
pluck or put in properly so that you can
make sure that you get the most
realistic hairline as possible because
this is blue all the way down as you can
see so this is glued all the way down
like but of course I'm not wearing it
like on
so as far as the shading girls I got
none so maybe it's just me I don't know
but I got like a zero with this wig
which I'm excited about because you guys
did all of my full length which I love
my legs first I love anything that
doesn't require me to soul you know so
um it didn't especially after I
left the bleach on for about 40 minutes
just so that I was able to take a
picture of what it looked like but it
was like the cover up though my hair was
like the color of a rubber band like it
was almost and some sections were like
six 13 so it definitely took it's really
in the back you can tell there's a lot
more blue back here than it is here in
the front which I like because it's
level its resting when I bought in the
Sun you can really tell um and again
it's one of those things that is a very
easy cut to do if you know how to cut a
straight line you should be alright far
as um the wig itself goes I really do
like it the only thing that I don't like
about it is the fact that it's not full
length which it clearly states on the
thing and they told me that's what this
was going to be I'm just not really into
the lace front like that
if I can't really do anything with the
back but I mean my hair has to be down
at all times at least when is full lace
or its lace in the back you can kind of
get away with pulling up if you would
like to I jump because I have so many
different ways to do so many different
things which definitely bother me but
for those who want a little more
versatility and yeah and then it was
very easy I just wanted to party down
the front and just use the color I think
I used for this I think I use two
bottles of a door and I went over at
once and then I went over it again to
make sure that all my color actually
took and you guys are level good blue
and if this is almost giving you blue
black although it's not as dark you can
still tell that my hair is blue it's not
like blue black and I'll know what the
hell's going on it's blue um but it's a
subtle blue we're from somebody from a
distance like a nightclub or if I'm out
like this you would just think that I
had a black ball that you wouldn't
really know that my hair was blue so I
like the the sneak of color the slink of
color that's cute so yeah I've never
worked with coming by before but I will
say it was a very smooth transaction
they were very accommodating
we're very sweet they were very
understanding and they gave me some very
very very very very good compliments
about my channel as well as the fact
that they were very understanding as far
as how long it was going to take because
I didn't tell them what I was going to
do with the wig I just simply said I
want it and then that's the one-on-one
and I was it and I really didn't know
what I was going to do until I actually
got it and then I kind of had this
epiphany that I was going to chop all
the hair off that was at the bottom so
yes I'm going to do a video on the cut
for this so though it's very easy and
very simple again if you can follow
directions and you can follow a straight
line and you will be following and
flying from two girls look at that look
at that look good God
so turned by you guys definitely get a
ten out of ten for me because I love
this wig and I will be definitely um
probably cut it a little bit shorter I
might cut it about right here that's
every moment I don't know how much I
like about that but we'll see I'm just
because I have stuff to play with but I
do like it
and I'll let me know what you guys thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
