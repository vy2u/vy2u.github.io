intro but I haven't shot it just oh I
don't my heart yes darling I really
really feel like good and I'm still out
here killing the game okay three kids
enter my billing and still killing it so
this hair is from coming by this is what
it looked like when I before I washed it
and all that good stuff so it's still
pretty much the same even though mines
look a little more on a tame side
compared to what they gave me
so having three bundles and I have in I
believe I'm wearing a this is a loose
wave and my fossil is an 13 by 4 18 inch
frontal bundles are they don't have the
things on them but I remember my longest
bundle was 26 24 and I'm assuming the
top one was 22 and then it was 18 but
you don't make sense
so only having three bundles although I
wish I kind of had another night and I'm
gonna tell you why so I'm gonna stand up
what you probably seen in my intro so
this is what one bundle of 26 looks like
at the bottom and then let me turn
around
so it's not crazy crazy full but it's
full and my hairline so I like this look
because it's effortless I got to do
nothing but King okay I do have to do
something I have to condition like crazy
I'm going to show you the conditioner
that I use all the time so I use of
course in my Tresemme cuz this just this
is readily available to everyone
however I am using and I have been using
the keratin shampoo I mean yeah the
keratin shampoo and conditioner from
magic hair company which works really
great you can't tell because of the
lighting I could set up I got going on
right now how lustrous my hair is let's
see mmm no doesn't help him but it's
actually pretty like the luster and his
hair is really good you just can't
really tell on camera I love the front
so I did this is first time in a very
very long time where I didn't do
anything to the front so we'll put it
away okay so it could have used a little
bit more plucking but I feel like for
Yahoo or starting out this would work
for y'all for me it is a little bit for
than I'm used to but I'm not mad at it
I'm not like oh my god my hair looks too
full now what I went ahead and did was I
took my wand which is pretty much the
standard thing like those a lot of the
fattest part is like I think that inch
and it's the Remington want and I just
used a very tip of it and I just went in
on my roots here just because they were
just straight they'll be on the high
feel about the straight roots I'm not
here for it so they were straight and
that was something that I wasn't crazy
about and then I'll stop with that I
wasn't also crazy about this pattern I
don't hate it
but I don't love it I like the wig
itself like this look itself I really do
like but if I had to choose the path
I think my pattern would have been a
little bit more on a tighter side it's a
little too loose for me I mean it is
called loose wave it's a little too
loose from my personal liking I like my
semi my curls and my pattern to be a
little bit more on the thicker side as
far as like Morty and Tamara like that
this is definitely giving me more on the
thing somebody called it an exotic wave
I said girl are you that is real 90s
across the exotic wave so that's kind of
the thing that I did too much care about
but like I was saying about the
conditioner you have to make sure that
you condition and diffuse condition and
diffuse condition and diffuse because if
you don't what's gonna end up happening
is when this hair gets matted cuz it
will then you're gonna have to go
through all of this stuff to try to get
it back in then you know what happens
when you matte hair you lose hair so
then your your your hair thins out
because you're not taking care of it
properly so yeah I would not I wouldn't
wear this hair if I'm a person who's not
good on maintenance if you're a person
who's like very very like I can't with
the maintenance it's too much to have to
take my hair off I wouldn't wear this
hair in a sew-in
I would wear it in a wig form because
that way you can take it off and get all
of the the kink of bugs and all that you
gotta get it I'm just a person who likes
the least amount of I mean me too I like
the least amount of care hair care I
have to do for any of my hair it's
present because I got a lot of wigs so
if you are president who don't like to
keep up with stuff and you do because
you need to you need to get back here
you have to get this you if you don't
get this it is going to do that okay
because this hair has a tendency to want
to lock up on you if you do not make
sure you put some new conditioner cuz
what people don't understand and I
always try to explain in every video
when you have hair and the hair starts
to rub up against the back of your neck
and
it's hot or whatever you got going on
all that doesn't start making the hair
do this okay so the reason why you want
to use a good conditioner is that
because the conditioner is gonna be it's
gonna pretty much make the hair much
softer and easier to maintain so when
you can do this with no problems then
you'll be fine
you giving them Sam when you can run
your fingers to it when our problems or
catch it while you're out then it is
easier to maintain but again your people
I know we're naturally curly hair be
like yo if I don't come on my hair or if
I don't throw it up in a bun I'm gonna
have a bit of an issue so for me if I
get his hair a 9 out of 10 I'll give it
a 9 just because I don't have any issues
with it and I really like the frontal
like the front sole okay and I went
ahead and fluted all the way down so all
the way like baby's hitting so even all
of this I can give you that realness I
can pull it up I can do all of that so
the front saw is really nice and again
only thing I did was bleach it and I
didn't even bleach it to its full
capacity and my not just a little bit on
the dark side and that was after 40
minutes so you might have to let it sit
and that was before tea um 40 minutes
because I was like it is not turning and
then they're going for another 20
minutes
and still didn't it's gonna take a
minute okay and I use 40 40 volume procs
alright okay so it's a little stubborn
least mine's was a little on the surface
I so that's something that I didn't like
too because again I have to use more
product but it did come out I looked at
a lot of girls who have naturally curly
hair and how the hair lines look and
usually they live they have like this
even like if you look at like Nicole
sure burger they all have like this halo
a shorter hair look right here and then
their curls start but it's never just
hair line and instead cuz then it just
starts to look like a wig but I do have
to be careful how much valium I put
right here because if I don't like hair
it looks more like my natural hair but
when I do this it starts to look like a
wig you get what I'm saying even though
it's toss hold is so full at the top
because I did have to curl the roots so
the
four times you make the roots look even
as long as you're not straight the more
of a chance you have to get away with
this because it will look more natural
so what I'm going to do is I'm gonna
turn off all these spare lights so that
you can see the luster in his hair
because on camera because all of the
pink that's going on is really drowning
out the actual hair and the hair is just
looking like okay it's really kind of
like not this shiny but it's shinier so
we're gonna do that so you can kind of
see that it does have a natural luster
in it um after our washing condition did
it doesn't look dry or anything like
that it does have a very natural luster
into it it's not dry it looks very very
very nice which I like and as a very I'm
washed out old buddy
it's the Q wash down what a boom that's
what I'm feeling like you know being
this is just all this frontal girl I'm
just I'm in love with it like lately I
would say Aliexpress have been getting a
frontal game no matter what the front
will be poppin so I'm actually happy
with that because for a long time
frontals was a headache because of all
the work you had to do so the fact that
you can get this look this very
realistic look without having to do
anything and it's straight out the box
like this
yo bro little bubbly from Anasazi that's
what that is
but yeah you see how that how natural it
looks and it's like my hair is you know
hydrated it's not dry or anything like
that cuz ain't nothing worse than some
dry curls girl just let it go so again
this is some coming by look at some
other reviews on YouTube about this
particular hair because I feel the way
that I feel about it I know some people
like this particular look I'm just not
sold on the look because I'm not a big
fan of blue suede hair and although this
looks very natural and very nice it's
just not I like my curls to be tighter
and you know smaller or sometimes even
bigger depending but this is just too
loose for me or maybe it's probably
because I only have three bundles and
maybe if I had another one I would feel
like
here with bigger cuz it does feel a
little bit back here it feels flat and I
think it feels flat like that it looks
natural go okay I'm just a dry clean at
heart in real life so I like my hair to
be like this fold and like this big like
this big
so yeah that's I think that's just kind
of what it is is like I'm used to my
hair being like my hair is laid but I
got a wig on as opposed to this could be
my natural hair depending on who you ask
and what we get and would like me so if
you guys are interested in this hair
from coming by this is their loose wave
I am wearing I think a 26 24 or 22 in my
frontal was pre plucked and it came in
18 inches okay so I'll catch you guys in
my next one P</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
