late ass toc movie review because I know
a lot of you guys wanted to know what my
opinion was on the TOC crazysexycool
movie and I didn't do a review like
right after it came out because I knew
that it was gonna I don't matter what it
is with TLC is always something after
the fact so I said let me just simmer
down and kind of see what's gonna end up
happening and of course pebbles came out
and said some stuff Reyna has came out
and said some stuff to bugs and chilli
I've came out and said some things so
we're gonna kind of cover all the bases
as far as that as well as the movie oh
my thoughts especially being a big TLC
fan I love the movie I thought it was
great wasn't too accurate however you
know this is a movie and you can only do
so much in 2 hours so of course if you
were trying to tell your last 20 years
or however many years you've been on
this earth you're gonna have it is
you're trying to condense it all into
two hours as well however I did I do
have to say that the biggest props of
everybody in the movie goes to little
mama and that's because she did not have
Lisa here to say I would do this I
wouldn't do that she only had t-boz and
chilli which was great because those
were her bandmates however it still
isn't anything like having that person
here so I think that she out of
everybody deserves the biggest applause
because she did a incredible job like
from Lisa's personality to her laughs
especially when they were in the UM they
were in a store and she acts did the
condoms come in polkadot like it was
eerie how much she was like reminding
like she just had left on all over her
juice adora
I knew drew from white chicks and I knew
her from being on the game but I wasn't
really familiar with her as far as
öiím being a step up I have a picture
from years ago at the premiere the sepal
from here but I wasn't really too
familiar with her she was gonna be able
to portray an actual living legend a
living character and she did an amazing
job she had the voice down the attitude
down you know Chivas has a very boyish
way about her when she's performing and
even sometimes in her regular life so
the fact that she had kind of got that
down pat like boom was everything so
yeah I love the fact that drew did her
homework and she kept she embodied t-boz
to me like little mama embody Lisa but
drew really gave me like I feel like I
was watching TV eyes the person that I
would say I was at least impressed with
was was keke palmer only because at
times I felt like I was watching keke
palmer play chilli and I wasn't watching
chilli you know but I will say this and
a lot of people wanted to know what my
opinion was on the baby here I will say
Kiki did or whoever ate the hell did
Kiki's hair did a great job with getting
the baby hairs the baby hairs right on
her lace wig I will say that that Indian
here they have for her was OnPoint they
really gave her the chilli essence so I
was very happy about that but overall
the movie was great um it was I didn't
like how during the first half of the
movie it seemed like they were like very
going through each and every single
thing within the last portion the last
hour of the movie it was like we're
gonna rush the fan mail the rest of
crazysexycool t-boz had a baby chilli
had a baby
Oh chilli and dad was saying together
time war is he vies and you know like it
just it kind of it felt like it felt
like that and that's the only thing that
I didn't like and I wish they would have
spent more time
Owen um crazysexycool and a lot more
time on fan mail because fan mail was
one of those albums that gave TLC
with no scrubs being as big as it was it
gave TLC a platform that a lot of groups
yet they have not even got there yet uh
like Destiny's Child and I love me some
Destiny's Child don't get me wrong but
doesn't shot will never be COC like
that's just bottom line and TLC comes
from an era of girl groups that I love
like total and total TLC um who else was
out during that time it was so many
groups in the 90s that came out
especially girl groups of the early
2000s we had thrilled w yeah you know
I'm saying so it's great to kind of see
what they started how they kind of
planted their foot like The Supremes did
for them you know I'm saying in and I
want to say the weather girls but you
know we gonna let that go um one thing
that I did love was the fact that they
let them redo all of the TLC um
covers for the intro of the movie like
you can see that they had actually redid
the fan mail cover and wanted COC tip
and crazysexycool
and I like how they they really focused
on those three albums cuz I don't like
3d and I'm not gonna lie and say that I
don't like hands up cuz that is my jam
however I don't like that out one so I
like how they just kept it with the
first three albums especially because
Lisa was here for all three she was not
here for 3d but um overall the mood was
good
the dude Cole from Martin no I didn't
really get an LA read vibe from him the
chick who played pebbles though that was
in a Tyler Perry movie she did a really
good job now let's get to pebbles
pebbles is saying and pebbles son Aaron
follows me on Twitter which I had no
clue about until I went to his page
because I said some smart when the movie
I came out and I went to see if he
blocked me with he had been following me
for quite some time but I mean he's cool
you know I follow him back now I don't
know how long he had been following me
beforehand but pebbles basically said
that the way that she was portrayed in
the movie was inaccurate and it was a
way for them to cash in and make money
here at her expense
now these stories about pebbles treating
them in this way and doing this stuff
to them is not new these they have been
telling these stories as long as Beyonce
has been telling them damn stories about
her daddy making them running them damn
heels so I know for a fact that she knew
that that was gonna come and people need
to realize my perception of you and what
the hell you did to me may be totally
different on what you think it is or how
harsh it may have been to me versus what
she may have said like his life you
never saying you live you learn you grow
whatever but she's basically saying
she's gonna take legal action then there
was a rumor going around that she was
gonna sue Lisa for some money that she
owed her from 92 no Lisa's not here okay
so she's gonna sue Lisa's estate which
is kind of like okay chick you're kind
of reaching a little but she said
recently that's why I wanted to wait to
do this review because I wanted to not
have to continue to keep coming back
repeating myself so she basically said
that's not true she's not suing Lisa's
estate and there is no lawsuit or
whatever I don't know who's telling the
truth whatever but if she did do it I
would not be surprised um and then the
other thing was Rayna raindrop Lopez who
is Lisa's sister she's been coming out a
little bit saying uh you know the family
was not involved they were not invited
to the set they were basically shut out
of the movie when the movie was shot in
Atlanta and they feel like it wasn't
fair on Chile and t-boz is part for the
family not to be a part of because
obviously they have to sign off to use
her likeness for the movie so they did
that part but they said after that they
didn't know about shooting schedules
they didn't know about anything now
they said they wish they would have have
been able to be consulted about this and
you know I guess you could say part of
it and I understand that because if one
of my friends passed away and we made a
movie about our lives and we included
them you know I would feel a sense of
respect to have their family especially
their family is letting me use their
likeness have them a part of it but at
the same time let me just say this
because I understand where she was in
Chile you come over I understand we're
ratings
- but I understand where Chivas and
Chile are coming from this was not the
Lisa left eye Lopes story
this was the TLC story and t-boz in
Chile they basically did the story based
on their perception of what they dealt
with with Lisa because like Chile says
this is not a movie about her growing up
of being a little girl that would make
sense this is about her being in a group
with us we spent the most time with her
and each other than anybody else so we
know each other the best throughout
these years so what reason would it be
for us to consult them about this is
that the other you know and I understand
it's a sensitive subject because they
lost the sister they lost a daughter I
understand that but at the same time you
guys gotta understand it's business and
that's sometimes in this business that's
how things work like that story is not
completely accurate there was no
Jermaine Dupri there was no um who else
was missing there was a lot of people
missing from that situation in the movie
but like I said it's a biopic it was it
was straight to TV they had a deadline
they think keke palmer said they shot
for 31 days that's all that's though
good time to shoot a long-ass movie
about the last 20 years um and you know
things happen you get that creative
freedom where you sign up when you like
if I sell my story to somebody they can
take they can build upon whatever
happened to me and make it more
entertaining and that's the thing you
guys had to be entertaining because if
the movie went to every little aspect
the movie would have been weeks long and
some people were saying it should have
been like the Jacksons story where I
remember it was like I used to come on
like every day for a week or something
like that people's attention spans ain't
that long y'all that ain't gonna work so
overall I give the movie a 9 out of 10
and the only reason why I say that is
because there were some inaccuracies and
whatever you know but I took that on
machine overall though the girls did an
amazing job the story came out great and
I think that TOC to me our is the best
girl group to ever do it
and will be the best girl group unless
somebody comes along but these will help
us today can't stay together you know I
remember 3rw was throwing chicken at
each other and and they thought
that they'd break up was gonna be like
Destiny's Child's and it was gonna be
able to come through and get a new
member and you know she looked just like
the other girl she was dark-skinned he's
like we're gonna replace Natori and it's
gonna be what it is a little Tory got
the last laugh now didn't she um but
yeah I mean up to me I think that the
movie is great and I think it's a great
way for especially with Chile having
Tron and t-boz having chase they can
look back and see like my mom was like
that bitch like how Rihanna is right now
how Nicki Minaj is what was their
mother's did that you know I'm saying
they put them on the map to do that so I
think it was a great movie and if you
guys have not checked it out you can
check it on the vh1 app it's the teal
scene the crazy sexy cool to TLC store
you can check that out and yeah I will
talk to y'all later
and yeah that's saying that's all talk
to you guys later
yeah bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
