just did a review but I went through the
whole movie in NASH it's not gonna work
so we're gonna talk about code of Chucky
which is the new Chucky movie that just
came out on streaming it's available on
Netflix right now if you guys wanna
watch it you're gonna look no boo leg
sight it is not a theatrical release
because you guys know the Chucky movies
are straight-to-dvd movies as of now but
I have Chuck and E with me my satchel
dog and my cookie dough and um I'm gonna
talk about my Chucky film that's coming
out as well in this video so I'm gonna
get you to my review of this movie and
what I didn't didn't like about it I'm
gonna be as fair as possible I'm not
gonna say too much about it because it
is on streaming so I would like for you
guys to watch it if you want to to kind
of get an idea so if you haven't seen it
as of yet I suggest you watch it then
watch this so-called of Chucky is 2017
we haven't got a Chucky movie since 2012
I believe she was when curse of chucky
came out which is legit my least
favorite Chucky movie ever
I feel like cursed to me is worse than
seed okay but I can say this rotten
tomatos gang curse of chucky cult of
Chucky the new film and ten out of ten
one hundred percent on Rotten Tomatoes
which is very unheard of because most
big-budget movies get horrible ratings
as of recently so for this to have know
about reviews is crazy I love they
paying for these or nothing but I see
why though I can believe it it's not a
shit movie in people that yeah it's
actually really good um so I'll get into
like how I thought about the plot of the
movie the plot of the movie was a bit
confusing in the beginning because
there's two simultaneous stories going
on that make a one story at the end I'll
say that and it has to do with of course
Nica the last character and then Andy
Barclay which is the original victim of
Charles Lee ray that started all of this
shit the plot itself I really liked it
because I'm not a big fan of lockdown
movies meaning
I don't like movies that take place for
majority of the movie in one spot such
as house on Haunted Hill and me feel ho
not am evil it means about the house but
you know what I mean
and cursor Chucky was like that Chuck
person Chucky was that we were in that
house for an hour and thirty minutes I
can't do it because it's not a house in
the world I don't even think you could
do a movie like that in a spelling Manor
cuz it ain't big enough after a while
some shit if nobody's notice that people
are coming up dead I feel like the movie
just kind of takes the realism away and
I get his horror and sometimes it can't
because we have killer dolls but um I
just wasn't into it the story and I did
a reaction to this trailer for this
movie for Kurt for cult of Chucky but I
didn't upload it but in that video I
expressed a very deep dislike for the
character Nica I really fucking did
because I just felt like the Doug
character was just so annoying and she
just served no purpose and then a
backstory of that movie I hated it but
anyway so with this niggas back of
course you know and we have Andy back
and we have a coarse black Brad d'oeuvre
Dwayne the words of Chucky and the whole
thing which I was completely fine with
okay the characters in this one although
it was a bit of a lockdown movie there
are moments when we're outside of the
insane asylum and we're not just there
it doesn't feel like that's all the
limit is the door and this film did that
we were they were moments where they
were able to go aside the climax of the
movie the very end of it takes place
outside so it doesn't feel and then we
have Andy to who was not a you know he's
not a patient so we see a different side
which made the movie feel more fuller it
just didn't feel like we was just like
what the fuck is about to happen you
know I'm saying like you just like I
watched it because well I'm talking
about cursor Chucky I watched it because
it was the first Chucky movie had gotten
years so I wanted to see what it was
about in then when I got it I wanted my
$20 back cuz I thought my paid during
that time for the special edition or
forgetting iTunes so when I heard about
this one I wasn't exactly excited
because I was thought there was gonna be
a reboot coming but clearly
so I'll start with Nika I like Niko way
better in this film that I did the last
one
I loved her in this movie I hated her in
the last one but I loved her in this
movie I loved andis character because I
feel like I got a bit of a nostalgia for
coz as you can tell my favorite
childsplay movie would be child's play -
I feel like child's play - probably is
gonna be the best child's play movie
that we ever get that literally is what
dawn intended for Chucky to be um I feel
like that with the factory and
everything just the score the colors
everything I just feel like chocolate -
is the best Chucky movie period but I
will say that if I had to put these in
chronological order that I like them it
will be child's play - child's play one
choice played 3 into mikoto Chucky and
then the rest of this shit dun dun dun
good I am like none of that but I love
this movie legit love this movie because
I feel like it brings Chuckie back to
his original state which I love which is
a killer doll and him being ok with
being a killer doll but it also without
giving the plot away for though and
don't nobody because I'm blocking people
who want to put spoilers below cuz I was
gonna do a spoiler video but I'm not I'm
not trying to watch it then come back
but um this movie answered a question to
me that I've always wondered since
child's played 3 and that was when if
you guys seen Charles played 3 when a
the good guy factory is being cleaned
out and they take the burnt Chucky from
the - at the end of - when Kyle Barnum
and his blood runs to the batter
I've always wondered why is there only
one doll why isn't there a army of
Chuckies out here because I'm sure that
one batter that big-ass thing about it
didn't make one doll that will always
stuck with me and I'm like I don't
understand if the blood is going back
into the doll is it all just in that one
particular zone the rest of them kind of
not got it
that was so this movie answered that for
me it made that make sense for me in a
way but overall I will say I'm very
happy with this film if you are a Chucky
fan you should watch this if you are a
killer doll fan of any store so if you
like
Anabelle or the Saw movies with the saw
doll or even just like the old episode
with talking Tina from The Twilight Zone
you should watch this it is comedic it
does have its comedic side of course
because you can't have a Chucky movie
without that but I do and it's not I'm
not gonna say that it's scary it's more
gory than it is scary it's really hard
now that we know what Chucky is and
we've seen it done a million times for
its it really be scary to you but if
you're looking for a nice little board
fest with some good punchlines and a
pretty solid storyline I think this
would be a good watch especially for
Halloween this will be really great to
watch so if I had to rated one on a like
I do my reviews a one out of ten I would
have to give it a nine and the reason
why I give it a nine is because I wasn't
crazy about the ending but I didn't just
like it I just wish it was a little bit
more and I would have liked to see
either Tyler or Kyle which I know she's
doing like they have Kristine Ellis
doing press for this movie but she's not
in it so maybe that's because he said
that child's play
what seven is a Chucky seven is actually
like ready to go so maybe that's what
they're gearing up for this or whatever
but I do like the fact that we got Andy
back because it felt like a Chuckie
movie again because it was somebody that
I recognized and it made the story
connect to make sense he has one victim
and another victim and they both are
here for pretty much the same reason
which is the killer's ass so yes I have
to say that I really enjoyed this if you
guys are interested in this movie go on
Netflix one of the new October recent
releases out to my Chucky film that was
supposed to come out for Halloween this
year unfortunately it's not gonna be
able to come out because I am not
finished whatsoever and I'll run into
issues because I needed insert shots for
a lot of other things it's just been a
headache and then one of the biggest
things that happened that pissed me off
and I was really sad about it'll make
more sense thank you
but unfortunately my good guy doll was
damaged when I was moving into my closet
and he fell and clearly smacked the
paint off of his ass so I'm in the midst
of doing another one of these for him so
right now we're going to just give you
that child's play - maniac hair and call
it a day but unfortunately yes he was
damaged in transit so that has that's
kind of been an issue I've literally
been living my life and filming for this
for the last year and it's become very
cumbersome and it's become a lot of
editing and a lot of shooting and a lot
of inserts and a lot of detail that I
really didn't anticipate when I first
started doing this so unfortunately it
will not be out this year but for a next
year for sure so all you guys who are
waiting I really do appreciate you guys
waiting some of you guys are gonna ask
me about this nice good guy shirt that I
have Owen which I actually had this made
from beloved shirts I had the original
stock image of this like it was like
fucking six thousand by six thousand so
I came out and it's printed on the back
- this particular image from the good
guy doll box so yeah unfortunately I
won't be able to release lines but to
hold you over you can go ahead and watch
the code of Chucky I think you guys
should enjoy it let me know if you liked
it if you did like it below and I will
catch you guys and if you guys have any
questions or whatever for me about this
or whatever let me know and I'll catch
you guys in my next one please</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
