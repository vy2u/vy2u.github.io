roast the out of hazel Eve big
pickle nose ass okay um so for all of
you who are new here thank you for
coming for all of you who are not
knowing what's going on right now hey
Louie is a rapper model mess from loving
if I Hollywood and hazel decided that
she wanted to go on this rant about how
all of these girls on the show hate her
okay fair enough
but then she decided to do two wrong
moves insult the gay community and
dark-skinned women of color I was like
woah woah woah woah okay so this season
of Love &amp;amp; Hip Hop hazel has definitely
been the most generic version of miss
Nikki baby that I personally have ever
seen like I know she's your friend but
you're not her girl okay you might want
to stretch when you you know you try to
reach that far in life girl okay you
gotta get this right before you can try
to do that
Nikki may be plastic but her plastic
works for her you're still that girl you
still have like a thumb a big toe you so
she decided that she wanted to have this
all this opinion about all of these
girls her boyfriend Rose Burgundy
okay the name it go whoo her name is
hailey okay Erica so anyway she decided
because some guy came out this all
started let me just go back this all
started because the comedian just
hilarious decided to clown the entire
she does it all the time the entire past
of loving him she doesn't with every
frickin franchise and it's not the first
time she's one of Hazel's I don't
understand what the the issue was
what today but okay so she goes off on
this rant and Hazel's boyfriend ex-lover
I'm assuming or currently
I don't know what's going on decided to
put him out there saying that he's only
with hazel because of the show and what
she's gonna give him and once he gets
what he wants out of this situation then
pretty much she's out he not be a mess
for her no more so I'm like okay so
you're just using her okay cool but then
he went a step further to put a burning
I'll put it right there
a burning gay flag and to pretty much
prove how much of a straight man he was
cuz I mean if you put her eyes dude you
did more damage than help I hope you
know little boy so that she decides she
wants to go ahead and comment and I'll
put that as well that says they all
shall burn in hell like it says in the
Bible it was funny and then I'm just
kind of like okay cuz I know that her
hairstyle is her ex hair sellers now he
used to be a trans girl and I think they
were pretty new with one another and you
know Hazel's hair always look like
garbage girl she always looked like she
just she got the wig shook it out
sometimes she needs shake that she just
put it on and then let it go I mean just
saying she has the worst style in the
entire season okay and that's including
the kids so I'm like really okay
so then she goes ahead a step further
and decided that she wants to talk about
how she put a picture of just hilarious
Brooke by the time Shonda from loving
hip hop that a Willys wife and it was
one more person but I don't recall who
it was I think it was my niece and she
decided to say my mother told me that in
my life that dark-skinned girls are
gonna hate me because I'm like skin and
you bitches are mad because y'all can't
pass the brown paper bag test now let me
tell you something I don't know what's
gotten into hazel I don't know how much
snorting she's done in this last 12
months but she got the game so up
it's not even funny
I'm not gonna even get into the gay
stuff right now I'm gonna go straight
into the dark-skinned stuff
hazel-e Erica I hope you understand that
no matter how light your skin is girl
you still look like a baboon I hope you
understand no matter how light your skin
is you still purchased your boyfriend I
hope you know that no matter how light
your skin is Brooke Moniz Shonda Lupita
viola Whoopi Bernie Mac all still look
better than you bitch so if your mother
told you as an individual that she will
be the best bitch on the world because
of the color of your skin that didn't
work okay
I hope she lied to you and if you're
gonna be mad at anybody should have put
a poster of her ugly ass up there to let
that bitch know she failed you as a
mother you are one of the most
unattractive women I've ever seen in my
 life
not just because your
whole pickle knows but the fact that
your attitude is bad you had surgery
after surgery after surgery understood
and you're still ugly all this money
couldn't buy you any class none of it
you wanna be jet-setting all oh let me
let me explain some to y'all I know a
lot of people who know hazel and I
remember when hazel used to live with
teairra not before not not during living
if I before loving ever she lived in a
cot on her couch had nothing and her
only claim to fame was she was a
publicist well let's be honest here hey
lose the all of her clients to try
to get some cloud and get somewhere and
it didn't work she's always been the
ugly girl she's always been the I
smashed we don't tell nobody girl she's
always been the bitch with the big nose
so you and your snout needs to figure
something out because the problem that I
have with girls like hazel is that
you're attacking other people because of
what one person said so she hurt excuse
was
well I still attached and someone said
this so that's why I said what I said no
if I don't give a if there's a
woman of color that's coming at me that
that bitch is getting it so Cassandra is
bout to get it
but Ashley tiffani-amber Monique none of
them did to me
so therefore I'm not gonna just say oh
 all you bitches because what I
could say
I tell you about fake-ass bitches in LA
like bitches like hazel-e who don't have
no talent and will they
wait to no-fucking-where and now she's
unemployed with a grown-ass child and
her wig still look a mess Mitch did you
see our interview with TMZ
what are your roots pick a struggle
bitch either you gonna be ugly
destitute broke can't rap bad wigs but
you can't be all of them okay because
that's the problem so pick which one you
gonna pick a struggle bitch because for
you to sit back and talk all this
and have nothing to stand on you were
fired from loving upon okay and
apparently that came before when you
actually exited the day of the reunion
you got fired because you're so busy
trying to go hard with you and mr.
burgundy meanwhile he got a mouthful of
dick his whole breath smell like dick
booty hole and you going so hard then
you're gonna dim the dude he was talking
to time I leave him alone me girl you're
damn near 40 okay if you're not 40
already I don't give a water
Wikipedia say bitch I know the real
Erica is damn near 40 so Hegel's issue
is that she believes that money fixes
everything money couldn't fix your nose
your teeth your attitude that then that
wig that outfit or that body you got
more of a box body and I've ever seen in
my life but you are the
wrong example of what I bet you are you
are actually V and the epitome of a bad
bitch and every negative connotation
that there is you can't dress you can't
rap
you can't bet you can either fight you
mistaken was by some drag
you lucky security was there you lucky
cuz my secret was a drag show
 ask for everything and
maybe you should have stitched your wig
bitch and then on top of that so cuz you
ain't gonna compromise you do what you
ain't gonna do is come from our
dark-skinned girls that's what you ain't
gonna do because there's a lot of
dark-skinned girls who out there rooting
for your old fat ass too and now look
soon as she talk about them ugly ass
gladiator sandals that she has with
ShoeDazzle
well shoe downs will decide to let them
know and let me read
their quote because I don't want to get
my words miss my phone so ShoeDazzle
said on twitter and i quote we are aware
of the recent social media post and I
thank and thank our friends from
bringing it to our attention
at ShoeDazzle we believe in love and
equality for all and have removed all
content associated hashtag love is love
so remember that million-dollar
ShoeDazzle deuce you talking about gray
was one pair of gladiator
senders and three colors
bitch and you know how to shoot down
somewhere girl you get it for one month
you can probably get through all three
of them within a two month period so a
girl I don't know what nobody's a
million dollars bitch please there are a
billion dollars there are a billion
dollar company bitch you got that much
sake in it and now you don't got
anything cuz now you just are you
gladiators about to beat you know nice
and raw
okay and rolfe t.j.maxx witty and i'm a
maxxinista but not for her so you lost
that deal you were fired from Love &amp;amp; Hip
Hop nobody gives a about this Oh
big no girl Inc and then on top of
that you own as trying to act like
you really that bitch and you not miss
nicki has a place we don't need
 bum ass hazel ass who was
a crook credit card fraud she I mean
there's so much I can say about hazel
that I know personally and it just to
see a girl who actually has potential to
do something not what she's trying to do
that's that Hazel's issue she wants to
be the star so bad but the only thing
that you really honestly should do is be
behind the scenes your face is made for
radio your face is made for laying the
 down your face is to get hit
doggystyle because nobody wants to look
at you in the face you were see you you
ran after a dude first season who didn't
want you and told you and you still
crying about it you still mad at Masika
because Berg is he's nowhere to be found
he is on the radio though but he don't
you don't care about this no more
you're the only one that's still here
your wig still look a mess you stink you
still look a mess you still delusional
you still 34 years old and you
keep trying cuz you know you
can't rap that what you doing so
for me hey Louise done she's cancelled
and two miles sir Brock who wanted to
defend his friend I get being boy is he
a friend I do and he was like when she's
not home before
but she's gonna she is yes she is
because you listen I could be the
madness as I wanna be okay when you're
mad you work off emotion and emotion
usually comes in for something that you
truly feel so if you say something or
you cosign something because you're mad
that's how the you feel so I'm not
going to racist rant and say well I was
only mad for that moment I didn't mean
anything that I said no I think before
us to me because that's part of being a
 adult and that's what she get
that for she and got she I can't
wait to see her ass on the bus oh my god
I want to just be like oh girl yes
remember girl I'm out here doing a
Maserati you are a rental Queen you
ain't got you ain't never gonna get
 to do that you wait suck dick and
you mad about it
so I don't know what to tell you but
quite frankly hey Louie you are the
epitome of what girls dislike when they
look at girls from LA you are the like
the full epitome of just a coon you're
an epitome of just like why girls like
halo I would never kick it with it I'm
born and raised in LA and I've been to
situations where I've seen this girl
I've spoken to her one time ever in
 life and that was already cuz
you could tell she was so worried about
who she was because she was on TV and
did somebody give a you're not that
girl girl nobody cares
and but you know you rose burgundy ain't
gonna care - as soon as he found a
 pocketbook with a dick attached
to it that's bigger than yours girl he
tired of sucking on your nose so as far
as that goes
don't disrespect any girls from your own
community your dumb ho and on top of
that you want to talk about well it says
in a Bible you should read them
scriptures about being a harlot
bitch cuz I listen the way to chiasmus
oil you you should be stoned so when I
see you bitch
