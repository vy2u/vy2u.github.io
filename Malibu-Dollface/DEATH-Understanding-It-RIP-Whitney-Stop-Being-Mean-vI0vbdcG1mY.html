videos again um and today I'm gonna do a
video a lot of topic I don't normally
talk about in that topic is dead um the
reason why I decided to do this topic is
because in the entertainment business
we're losing people like clockwork it's
ridiculous how many celebrities are
dropping like flies right now and it's
just not celebrities you know its people
in the world that are dying you know and
I don't want people to think that i'm
doing this video because it's
celebrities like it's kids dying in
Africa and you know it's kids committing
suicide and it's just death is just
among us like no other right now and
that's why I decided to do this
spectacle II give a peace of mind of how
I feel about the situations that are
going on right now I personally said
that I wouldn't do a video about Whitney
Houston and this video is not about
Whitney um because I respect her and I
respect her family and um I said my
piece about how i feel about celebrities
passing away with the amy winehouse
video I did I wish she passed away but
the reason why I decided to do this
video's today is because um I've seen a
lot of things said on Twitter and said
on facebook um that I don't necessarily
agree with as far as like no one said
anything that was in their RV who says
some things that are insensitive but um
I just basically want to give my take on
it um and just in general I think we do
you think is him forever be a great
talent you know um and she was a great
mother and sister you know when daughter
and you know godmother and mentor to a
lot of our favorite celebrities like
Brandi and Mariah and you know um but I
think what people often forget about
celebrities like we used
and amy winehouse michael jackson is
that these people have been up and they
have been down and they are human like
you and I and there is nothing in this
world that can make anyone a vincible
vincible invincible to drugs um to
heartache to enablers to any of that
because at the end of the day addiction
is addiction at the end of the day
consequences from the things that you
may have done 20 years ago will come
back to haunt you unfortunately you know
I have a lot of people in my life who
have I've lost because of prescription
drugs illegal drugs drugs in general you
know and as much as you want to help a
person a person can't help their self
unless they're ready you can't force
someone should do something so she could
have been trying to get her life back to
where she wanted it to be but
unfortunately circumstances have came
about and there's really not much that
you I or anybody else could have done to
really stop the situation um Brian be
did a video recently that I commend him
one about Whitney um because he said
something I was just definitely true
about her Michael um a lot of these
celebrities were passed away and we were
as respectful to them in life as we were
in death they probably would still be
here we never understand how much ours
as fans non-fans stands disrespectful
whatever the hell you want to call it
can really affect someone's way of
dealing you know I see district
disrespectful things written about
myself I'm not even a celebrity but just
in general when people don't like the
things that I do or say or how I look
and people will write things about me on
the Internet that shit hurts like these
are people who don't even know you
you know so you have total strangers
sitting back talking so much shit about
you and you see it and your friends are
calling you in and you got family seeing
this and it's just embarrassing you know
um and when it's on a mass scale like
that sometimes people don't know how to
deal with that some people turn to
certain things to deal with coping with
certain things but the thing that people
need to also understand is that these
are human beings these are people they
have feelings do you know they go
through things too so you have to keep
in mind that they see what you write
they see what you do they see how much
disrespect you have so no matter what
you say after they passed away you still
said it it's still stuck it still was
disrespectful and it was still wrong so
that's what people need to also
understand about people this is not just
Whitney this is not just Michael it's
not just me this is not just whomever
this is anybody because these are kids
out here killing yourself over words
that are typed on a computer and I
really didn't want to do a video based
on suicide but I have to because there
are a lot of young kids who watch my
videos for a way to look and I hear a
lot of letters about how do I cope with
this you cope with it so well I'm
learning just like everybody else I'm
not perfect um I walked a long mile but
I still got a lot of miles to go and I'm
learning just like the next person so a
lot of times I don't have answers for
certain things you know how i make cope
with something somebody else make up
with a totally different you know it
takes a lot for someone to hurt my
feelings but when they are hurt it does
feel a certain way and I'm sure that's
what anybody you know it's just not just
me as anybody um but the thing that I've
learned about death in general is all of
us were here these bodies that we have
basically been issued um
are just that they're here to help us
get through life your spirit and your
soul is what makes up an individual
that's why you say people he has a very
nasty soul you know he's beautiful but
his attitude is bad you know if that
soul was in a different you know that
that show with someone else that person
would be beautiful on the inside and out
so it's what's in here that matters not
what they look like you know I'm saying
or the physical being that is that
person I'm gonna die one day my mother's
gonna die my sister's gonna die my
friends are gonna die but our
personality we've done what we've said
well we have not said we'll all be
remembered and that's what you have to
understand I'm not trying to get
religious here but God gives us a chance
to be here sometimes it's longer for
others sometimes it's shorter for others
sometimes it's right smack dab in the
middle we don't know you know sometimes
we're issued things that we're not
necessarily ready to accept what we have
to we don't have a choice because your
time is your time no matter what the
situation is and sometimes you have to
really take into account ability that
you have to live every single day like
it's your last because you do not know
what will happen and I feel like this
Whitney Michael the little boy down the
street whomever when they pass away
they're going home this was a vacation
they're going home back where they came
from okay and that's how I feel about it
Whitney was a gift to us okay she gave
us beautiful music a beautiful voice
beautiful movie movies you know but
everything that is beautiful has a dark
side to it as well so do you get what
I'm saying it's a contrast this woman
who had everything
thing that you could desire have a
problem that money could not help so
that's why when people say they want to
be famous and they want to do this and
they want to be known by the world
sometimes that can be the biggest
nightmare dependent on the person she
wasn't always like that you know it
years upon years of doing the things
that she did Michael hooman but Amy all
of these people didn't start out like
this a lot of times it's the positions
that they're put in is the things that
they see it's the things that they go
through and this is no different from
the stuff that we go through the only
difference is there in the public eye
i'm sure last week there's a woman who
overdosed on probably something last
week that nobody cares about because she
didn't give us beautiful music but she
probably had the same problem Whitney
had nobody cares they don't care and
that is the issue that i have with
society today is that we glorify certain
people when the only thing that they
really want is a friend is a helping
hand is someone to understand what
they're going through and a lot of
people and the entertainment business
are just simply enablers and they'll
give you whatever you want in order to
get what they want and that's why I am
the way that I am getting into this
business I am very very choosy about the
things that I do the people that I
affiliate with and who I surround myself
with and why my circle has been the same
for the last four years with the
exception of some people but for the
most part I keep people around me that I
know when I'm doing something incorrect
I'm checked on it now no matter what the
fuck I'm doing or how big I may possibly
get they don't see me in that light and
that is a lot of times that is the
problem I don't want to turn to
something like drugs or you know
whatever the situation may possibly be
because I'm not happy
doing with what I'm doing that for a
long time I wasn't happy doing YouTube I
I'm revitalized I'm happy now you know
I'm saying I'm in a better place in my
life where I'm happy to do this again
but when I wasn't happy i didn't do it I
took a break I said I can't do this
someone I'm not it's too much on my life
is taking up too much of my time it's
taking up too much of me and when I got
back to the point where I felt like it
was ok i came back i'm doing a video
right now but people don't understand
that and just like a lot of times you
guys will come to me and say well why do
you having did a video and so long is
because i'm tired you know I've been
working I've been doing this I had to go
to eat event I had the photo shoot I had
to get the site stuff from a local kids
I had to do all of that you know I'm
saying it's like to do all of this and
then come home into a video that's a lot
so imagine when celebrities go through
they gotta do this they stack that fact
that fact that people expect them to be
on all the time sometimes drugs is the
only thing that you can turn to in order
to get you through today and that one
little situation can turn into a years
of problems so that's why I never judge
Whitney Michael Amy whoever the woman
down the street I don't judge them
because I don't know their life and I
don't know what they've been through I
don't you know and I think I said a lot
of you guys have to also realize to you
can't say that if I was in that
situation and I went to you you're not
in that situation so you can't make that
call you don't know what happened to her
you don't know what she's been through
you don't know what he'd been through
you don't know what they've been through
I never judged somebody who's homeless a
crackhead crack babe I don't know I
can't judge these people because I don't
know what transpired for them to get to
that whether it was self-inflicted for
them to not do what they were supposed
to do or it was uncertain it was
unfortunate circumstances that they end
up doing it whatever the situation is it
doesn't matter because I'm no better
than you you're no better than me
we're no better than them and as soon as
the world is able to grasp that concept
we will be able to be a better medium
for each other that's how I thought we
would just be able to just be better for
each other so my heart goes out to
Whitney her family Michael's family
people who have passed away you know
kids who have illnesses people who are
good my prayers go out to everybody
because you know what we live in a very
very cold ass world it is it's a very
cold world and some of the strongest
people can survive in it it's just about
of mine and a lot of times we need as
much prayer as we could possibly get a
much support as we could possibly we
just it doesn't make any sense for
people to be so cruel today you got kids
12 year old kids killing themselves it's
crazy when somebody could have simply
just came to them and told them that
they care you know so basically that's
what I had to say about it we're not
here to we're not here to be here
forever you know we have to go at some
point and just because you felt like
that person should have stayed here
longer that's not your call you know you
pay respect you bow your head and you go
about your business they're all right
you're gonna be all right we're gonna be
all right ok so just live every day like
it's your last cuz you never know what
could possibly happen i'm trying to
scare nobody but i'm just telling you
the reality of what it is you know the
reality and the truth of what it is who
knows what could happen tomorrow we
don't know so yeah you guys keep your
head up be nice to each other stop being
so goddamn mean he'd like for real like
just stop support somebody you see
somebody doing something say you know
big ups to you and what you doing right
now you know you did that it's not gonna
hurt if you feel like you could do
better to do better period that's all
you gotta do all right guys oh so y'all
