STIs Yano Haro but this is from Dina's
wings and this is a very very natural
wig this looks like the you know a lot
of girls who are natural or they're in
the midst of going natural and getting
out of relaxers I see a lot of girls
what they're kind of like this so what I
did was I kind of went online and looked
at some of the natural styles and how
girls are wearing their hair now you
know in its natural state which i think
is beautiful it's just not for me
personally you guys know I already did
the hair knots this video then after
hear a nice video you guys know how I
feel about natural hair I think it's
beautiful but it isn't not for everybody
however I do want to try something that
was a little bit different and kind of
out of my box for the girls I know who
are probably just did the big chop or
they're in a mess of transitioning but
they don't want to necessarily wear
their regular their real hair out right
now because it's not in its best shape
so this wig is from divas wigs it's Q
numbers CC 0:05 the length is 16 inches
the color is a 1b so that's an off black
the texture is a lack light yaki so I
would almost let me just go there real
quick what I think they did was they
made a took some light yaki air and then
they processed it and he's very tight
ringlet curls so it could have a lot of
value because again this hair is not
even pulled all the way through it I
haven't really fluffed it like I could
but it's just gonna continue to get
bigger and bigger and bigger
so we're not gonna do that i capsizes a
petite and the cap construction is a cap
number 3 this is an actual full lace wig
this is not a lace front the lace goes
all the way from the front to the back
there isn't an adjustable strap in the
back so I can pull
this it's tight or make it as loose as I
need in order for it to fit and because
this isn't more of a natural unity
you're gonna kind of be running your
hands to it and kind of being like
whatever with it then you want to make
it pretty tight
so that you can kind of pull and it
feels like it's a natural vibe but going
on with this but I do think that it's
cute I do think that is beautiful and I
do like it on me I just don't love it
because you guys know I'm very
accustomed to my nice familiar hair but
I do think it mimics a lot of natural
hair that I've seen very very very well
and I think for any girls or guys who
are in the midst of trunk wanna see what
they would look like and now from here I
think this is an a great option I really
do because it's given me a lot of
fullness has given me a lot of luster
it's giving me a lot of curls what I did
looking like I'm trying too hard this
very well could be my hair you know this
kid I go walk down the street I think
and nobody will kind of bet they're like
that's not really his hair you know I
think people would be like yeah you have
some beautiful natural hair again
natural hair is something that takes a
lot of maintenance and the reason why I
say that is because this hair does shed
a bit and the reason why I shed is
because you see how tight these are when
you start taking your finger and doing
this with it it's gonna eventually you
see how at the end it kind of got kind
of nappy you know it's not really a curl
no more it became like a frizzy curl so
then eventually once you keep doing it
and doing it and then you're gonna start
to get that just excess hair at the
bottom or you just want to pull it apart
like this and this is what I keep
getting a lot of you know but if you
don't plan to do that or you don't want
to really want to run your fingers
through it like that then you should be
good and now I've had this unit for not
that long it hasn't been that long I
think I've worked twice since I've had
it
I wore this too I think someone's little
get-together and nobody recognized me
which is good because if I really want
to be incognito
I really could wear this somewhere and
not really like pay nobody that you go
somewhere like to your family's reunion
or something like that you just don't
want to deal with nobody just wear some
different hair and nobody will recognize
who you are
um but nobody who I was nobody I mean I
did my makeup the same my hair was the
same it's a people to Congo oh oh you
know it's like that it just do them off
because I'm so accustomed to wearing the
same look which is either a side part
middle person way you know they're used
to me with the long flowy they're not
used to me like this at all and a lot of
them were like only a couple people said
they didn't like you but a lot of people
were like I really do like it
it's a beautiful unit and I think that
it's great that divas wigs is offering
something that is more on the natural
side leaves are protective style you
know and most natural people like know
like to keep their hair in protective
styles so it's great then you kind of
get best of the both world so if you are
in the myth you know in the midst of not
really not sure if you want to do the
big chop or you want to kind of go in
that direction I would definitely get
awakened and see how you like it and see
if you could deal with your natural hair
everyday because in all honesty this is
how my real hair looks on a regular
basis when I wash my hair out it's just
longer but when I wash it it's really
really thick and full like this so
that's why I take me forever to comb it
out that's me forever
that way every time people that were you
going we don't see your natural hair I'm
like I don't it take me so long to get
it out of this state to blow-dry my
tongue I'm Dylan I'm tired and I'm about
to give me some more braids so that I
can put my wig back that's where I met
with it you know because it is again
it's a lot of work and the thing about
wigs that I do love is that I could take
this off fluff it out and then tomorrow
when I get up I can just put it back on
I don't have to worry about you know
putting in a bantu knot or anything like
that where I'm just like what am I gonna
do with my hair
you know this is this is it's already
pre-done so it's the luxury of a
beautiful wig in a more
actual state where nobody would even
question if it was really yours or not
so if you guys are into this a look I'm
feeling very like you know like mother
you know um I'll click the link below
and let me know what you guys think and
I will catch you guys in the next peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
