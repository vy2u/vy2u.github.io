she's a daily regiment video like what I
use on my face or whatever today I'll
have no makeup on I think I have on
asthma only I've done is my eyebrows
which I did very quickly and sloppy
today but whatever um but this is
basically what I use on my face on a
regular basis like my scrubs my
cleansers my moisturizers and stuff like
that because people have been asking me
since my last channel can you please do
a tutorial on with your daily routine
could be I guess I don't know um so yes
um the first thing that I actually was
using and I still use but I don't use
like as often is the st. Ives apricot
scrub and first skin
I still use this one but the reason why
I stopped using this one every day is
because this one when you wear makeup
this is to cleanse like everything so
when you wear makeup this up does not
close the pores it isn't I make them
smaller just not reduce them they make
them larger so you look like you have
pin holes in your face when you kind of
finish this so if you do use this make
sure that you have something like a
toner or something that you use after to
kind of snap your pore shape because
it's not it was not looking the greatest
but as you can see I still this is
pretty much gone it's like a little bit
left and I believe and getting my
products so I will cut this over here
before I buy some more um this is
usually when I go it's like a $3 and for
scented Target or something like that
when I was like three almost four
dollars now but um that worth it though
it says 25% more so as you can see
because this one is there is a size
difference um the other one that I use
is the st. eyes timeless this is the one
I use every single day like I was doing
that one but I use this one every day
because this one says timeless skin
apricot scrub visibly tones and firm
skin so this actually is good for your
pores um and this is good for getting
makeup off this is really good
um for when you have breakouts and
stuff like that I'm really doing this
based off my own skin I have dry skin so
this is pretty these are the products
that I use for dry skin I'm sure some of
these products working you can use for
everyday whatever skin but I use these
personally for dry skin um this is um
they're 100% both of these are 100%
natural ingredients and exfoliant this
one is really rough like it's like
cement um but it doesn't hurt it's just
that you might want to give it a little
bit of water before you use it um but it
does work and because me right in like
the bridge of my nose and up in this
area right here I tend to uh it gets
like gritty like you know because my
skin is like a build up or whatever so I
have to make sure that I use something
every day that has a greediness to it
and that's why I was using this this one
is not as greedy this one has more of
more of a like a the base of whatever is
in this um is more of a quick nut creamy
it's more of a liquid whereas this is
like a cream risk of what a lot of beads
in it this one has more of a
watered-down feel to it but it smells
great and so does this one
um but the bees are not as harsh and
they're not as they're not as frequent I
guess that's the crook where they're
nice frequent um as this one I love them
equally but I you just tend to use this
one a little more and I use this one
twice a week um on my skin and yeah
water does help both of these products
but with this one I don't use water this
one I have to because I run off um
the other product that I use on my face
after I use that is I will use um
noxeema a lot of people ask me what do
you use to shave so that you don't have
the UM like the 5 o'clock shadow
situation up in here because I do have
to shave like contrary to popular belief
I do have to shave
so I use this to shave I don't use
shaving cream I use this to wash my face
as well but I do use this to shave I'm
because and as you can see this is
almost gone so I will be getting some
more along with that apricot scrub um
but I do use this and will recommend
this only because um it does it does
exactly what I supposed to do and it
cleanses your face and I find that
because I use this to shave when I do
get kind of in the nooks and crannies
and started to pull the hair and stuff
like the it conditions instead of
ripping and then I have to go back and
you know I'm put motorized or regardless
but this does help a lot and it does
prevent um my breakouts so it definitely
because I shave like at least four times
a week so I do have to make sure that my
skin does not start to get dark and
stuff like that because of the razor and
I use like I don't use no special razors
I just used a little throwaway ones or
whatever um just make sure that they
have like the aloe strip at the pot at
the top and at least two blades but I
use these um four so my dudes that shave
and my girls we have to show young
shout-out to y'all um this is actually a
good alternative if nothing works for
you again all these products may not
work for everyone's skin but for my
particular skin these things do happen
to work very well
um this product that I use which is the
set of field um clit daily cleanser I
use it every day
um it's it's for normal to oily skin and
then I have another one - that's for dry
skin no the thing is for dry skin I
don't know this is the only one that
I've seen or whatever but um I used it
it wasn't I didn't see a noticeable
difference I won't lie I didn't really
see a big difference in using it and not
using it it was just good to have like a
daily cleanser to kind of get everything
gone but since I use everything else
it's just I maybe that's why I use other
stuff with it and maybe if I just tried
it by itself but I just like to I'm the
type of person because I do wear makeup
so I like when I go to sleep I don't I
can't sleep and makeup to save my life
and you guys who
please wash your makeup off before you
go to stick because if you keep your
makeup on you get the risk of getting
breakouts bacteria um you can you can
damage your skin your skin can bring
your pores can get clogged you can get
blackheads you can get a lot of stuff
from keeping your makeup on especially
since you have been out all day so the
day is sitting on your face on top of
makeup on top of bacteria on top of dirt
so it's just I don't care how sleepy you
are how tired you are that's what you
use and a lot of people say well I'm not
paying six and seven dollars for makeup
remover because I don't feel like it is
um it costs too much you don't have to
use makeup remover to get your makeup
off properly you could use vaseline or
petroleum jelly if you choose to you can
use even their tummies and I'm not gonna
lie there's times where I rent ran out
um when I was using like makeup remover
and make a path and stuff like that
right now you go in your kitchen and get
you some regular cooking oil some some
olive oil and that will strip everything
anything oil-based will take your makeup
off so that's why some makeup set is
waterproof yes waterproof but um if it's
oil whatever has oil in will take the
makeup off and that will prevent you
from having our dark circles and raccoon
eyes and stuff like that as you get
older because that you know makeup has a
lot of toxins in it and it will sit in
your skin and embed in your skin and
then your going to be mad because you're
going to be like in your 30s and you're
going to have to wear concealer I know
some people so this I would recommend
for people who need a daily cleanser
because it's very gentle but it's just
not some it smells great it's just not
something that I'm just crazy about like
it really didn't make any difference to
me and the last thing that I use for as
far as moisturizing is again I use
Cetaphil this set of field is usually
recommended by your dermatologist but
for me this is for dry and sensitive
skin and because I've tried a lot of
other um having dry skin I've tried a
lot of other moisturizers that just
really didn't do it but this is done it
um this retails this and my local target
is like $12 - about ten dollars but some
places I've seen it up to fourteen
dollars
um this is a 16-ounce jar it's fragrance
free it's a lot in here just brought
this one but as you can see there is a
lot in here um so I just finished my
other one and I had it for like three
months so yeah this is about ten this is
about six this is about four and both of
these are around three each so it's not
you don't have to buy SuperDuper
expensive I know some people use Olay
and AM B and B or a and a lot of other
companies that promise the same things
that those do is just that they're a
name-brand and they claim to revitalize
skin and snap them back and all of this
stuff just really fine within your
budget for you to work for your skin I'm
not paying $30 for a moisturizer my skin
ain't that damn dry like okay I get it
but we're not gonna do that because it
to me that's just stupid and then the to
be this small oh you only need this much
no my skin is dry as hell like I need
something to hydrate and the reason why
I don't some people say well won't you
just use like witch hazel and stuff like
that like I've never had an issue with
acne and usually that's what that's for
to kind of cleanse the acne in your face
and stuff like that um but I've never
had that issue and I'd like to use like
some people they have a lotion like this
too but this is a cream and a lot of
people say that it broke them out um but
it did you like I said it depends on the
skin for me this works because when you
moisturize your skin you have to start
to kind of build upon the layers like
you have you have your dermis and your
epidermis of your skin and you have to
make sure that they're hydrated because
if you're only conditioning top part as
soon as you wash your face all that
conditioning is gone so you have to make
sure that you kind of set something like
thick like this where it will sit and it
will stay and it will penetrate the skin
shop where you'll be iced out really uh
okay I know this stuff because I went to
beauty school so we had to learn it in
aesthetician part portion of it so yeah
that's why I know this but yeah you this
is good if you have dry skin but I don't
know some people who do
I've only skin and they said they
working never broke them out so again it
depends on the person and depends on
your skin you cannot go about with
everybody says you can't go by what I
say or anybody just have to try it out
for yourself to see if it works for you
but if you can also use this on your
body to let if you have a dry feet or
something like I me I don't but it'll
work it's a really really good product
and it's definitely worth the money
um but yeah those are them those are the
only things that I use like people use
like it's 14 things and I just feel like
if you use a cleanser and it use another
cleanser then you use a semi exfoliant
and then it's just your stripping
everything go you're going to be dry as
hell so I can't really give no advice on
oily skin because I'm happy but I don't
have like psoriasis or you know like
eczema or anything but I do have a nice
amount of dry skin every now and then um
so I just have to keep myself hydrated
so those are the things that I
personally use that people kept asking
them out or whatever and if you have any
questions or anything or all of that
stuff let me know I put a detailed list
of all of these things at the bottom so
that you guys know such amateur local
Walmart's targets or drugstore comm if
you need to and yeah I will talk to
y'all later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
