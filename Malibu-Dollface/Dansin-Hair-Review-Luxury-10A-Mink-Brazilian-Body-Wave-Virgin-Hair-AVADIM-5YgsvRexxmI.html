like the New Deal like I'm the big big
club around the block and I'm gonna come
through to my photo shoot and act up and
I'm not going to try to be pretty and
cute I'm gonna be rough and tough
because that's what I do I feel like
that's what I'm giving right now so this
hair which has been literally like the
Breezies easiest body wave I've ever had
because it hasn't give me no issues like
is real cool it's from a company so
learn from a company called dancing hair
yeah dancing hair and this is their mint
Brazilian
this is their mink Brazilian by play now
they this is their ten eighth grade a
body weight mink hair now me is
something that's been thrown around a
whole lot and that's a term that is used
often but for me personally I just don't
see a difference between this hair and
any of the other body waves that I've
ever had like it's not special of any
sort it's just body weight now and as
I've seen I went through I do not
remember let's see if they put my
original limp in here because I don't
remember what they were because as soon
as I got this I could it but I only have
it three bundles and it's real cool like
look it's real food gather from this and
there them using them the term mink is
that because I only have in three
bundles the Harris Fuller's an average
body weight hair and I believe that
that's what the point is here to say
that it's mink hair is if it is virgin
hair but like I said whenever it's this
uniform and if this isn't I can't be
virgin because nobody's here
unless it's person it was all one person
which I highly doubt that a Brazilians
person's hair was this minified know but
it's very nice and I will say that it
definitely doesn't give me any issues it
doesn't give me any problems it stays
like this since I've got it when I do go
ahead and watch it I like to use you
know my Tresemme conditioner and I use a
diffuser and it goes back to this when I
originally got it I believe this here
was somewhere between 22 and 24 inches
when I received it again
having three bundles and it's very full
I think they'd send me a frontal and
that was the one thing that I did not
like I don't know what it was about
their frontal but it just didn't work so
I ended up finding this closure that I
had around to go with this and I just
wanted to front to match the back so
that it could be all as one and I saw
this cute little headband from forever
21 that was bandana which goes with my
gorgeous gets a t-shirt that I made and
these cute little adidas shorts which I
wore once before in the reviewer was one
but I wore it and then I had on these
nice horse glasses that are blue just
like my so it's a blue the red white and
blue thing it's very you know fourth of
July I'm gonna did was I put my closure
in I'll put a little concealer here and
a part so you can see it better because
sometimes on camera like in person it'd
be fine but then when you get on camera
sometimes things just start to look very
faint like you can't see it as good as
you want to so that you guys can
actually see how a party knows you don't
have a mop on my head cause it's without
this this is what this will look like
I'm up and the lipstick that I'm wearing
is lady balls from Too Faced and my lip
liner is pres mystic from Cali so yeah
this hair has legit giving me no issues
and usually by the way here after a
while it won't do this it won't stay
like this you know body weight tends to
droop after a while so I had it I had
worked about a good week in his natural
state it was still in his natural length
and then I was like I just want like a
very just messy bob that I can just go
and throw a headband or a hat one or
just wear it like this and then go about
my day originally you guys know I love
my side parts but I was going to do it
in a five part but I don't think I've
ever done a messy Bob in a middle part
so I wanted to do that just something
that I could literally just go like this
and be good with like it wasn't going to
do anything that was going to take me
you know I could run errands with it I
see when I walk the dogs today I'm like
a little outing or whatever and I wore
this and I wore my hair like this
because I thought it was anything give
me no issues is it's kind of hot here
not as hot as Ben but if I but it didn't
bother me or because it's it's light it
not it looks like it's a lot of hair
because it is full but it's very light
you know it doesn't give me any issues
as far as me overheating or whatever
wanted to downsize about this that I
don't like it the fact that I can't like
just like put it behind my ear because
it's gonna look crazy because I don't
have that frontal but yes the frontal
was just too thin and then first we just
didn't blend like I would have liked it
to blend and that was something that
irritated me like to know in about this
but again it didn't really matter that I
was in the middle part know how I did
like a side part I would have kind of
been more like I really match them up
Russell didn't work out but it didn't
bother me at any sort of this now as far
as the shedding goes I'll run my fingers
through this yeah I'm getting nothing
and when I when I watch it I don't get
any shedding from this hair not that I
can remember up at all and not very you
know very uncommon because of the fact
that usually what happens is with
bodyweight hair you get a lot of
shedding because of the fact that it's
not a straight texture but it's also not
a curly texture that in between so
sometimes you end up with a snap or
sometimes it'll want to nap up or I
guess tangle up is the correct term but
yeah I mean nothing it's cool you know
and you guys know I like to do my hot
little glue gun message for a lot of
units because it's easier it's quicker
um so I did the whole unit as a hobby
because I know it's going to be
something very smooth and easy like this
I didn't want to have to sold out a bob
like it's so unnecessary
so yeah I'm dancing here you guys get
definitely a b-plus for me I'm going to
take off the a because I didn't like my
frontal my front we just wasn't popular
but as far as the hair goes it's good
and his hair is actually all one again
of a uniform color it's not like kind of
a brown here and then kind of black over
here it's kind of a two down here okay I
just had to send hair back again because
of Debbie yeah
I know I got some hey
that was almost before like for real and
they send me three I'm like nobody
noticed that this anyway another video
but yeah yeah I think that's the only
thing I didn't like was the fact that my
frontal just didn't match my hair and it
wasn't going to blend we went to blended
issues once before if it was straight it
would have been so easy because I think
I do is a straight straight in straight
you know but again like I said in a
begin this video I don't see anything
different from this hair as far as
texture goes to make it mean other than
the fact that it is fuller than most
hair now you guys know I did have me
straight there and not here was very
very cool so I'm gonna go cuz I asked
some Pennines what does that mean they
they usually give me like a very vague
answer that just doesn't mean anything
but when I was reading on their site
they were saying that you know great age
means means fuller hair with less
bundles so it pretty much gives you more
bang for you but you don't have to buy
as many bundles because of the fact that
it'll be full enough with just three so
if I can get this with three imagine
what you can do with five you know like
the girl I'm gonna light it up I'm on
brutal
so yeah they get a nice b-plus for me
just work on your uncle when it comes to
texture hair I'm sure there's right here
it's fine
so if you guys are interested in this
nice Bob and again are those we're going
to ask me how I did this I literally
just took it in with three sections I
usually start from the back to the back
let me know how much like where I want
to cut it I just chopped the back chop
the thighs and chop the front and I was
fine and then I left it a little bit
longer in some spaces like here just so
I can feel very messy and big and kind
of just running Rudy but it's still cute
you know you still can get away with you
don't look like I'm like I just got up I
still look kept you know so I will put
the links for this below let me know if
you guys like this I feel like Arya off
of pretty little liars
even though I need to catch up about and
watch but my sister fall in her
snow-white hair because they're just
blunt it was very fun it's so the points
on the causes wig Arya and I'll catch
all in my next good evening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
