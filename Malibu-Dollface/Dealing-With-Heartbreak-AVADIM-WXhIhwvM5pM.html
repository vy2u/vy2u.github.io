missed the topic and I've had a lot you
know like I had enough time to kind of
get my mind together to give y'all a
topic video that makes sense so this one
is going to be like I guess how to get
over heartbreak or heartache or whatever
the you want to call it when you go
through something with somebody the
review for this hair should be up
already if it ain't it's coming in the
glasses the link to these will be slow
so I had my first real heartbreak which
I didn't know that's what it was and
when it happened I just wanted to die
probably gets it I was like 14 I was in
a relationship and for almost a year
like almost a year to the day and the
president broke up with me and I guess
this was a little different for me and I
had a hard time kind of Oh getting over
this or dealing with difference because
I guess the first time in life I had
ever been broken up with usually I am
the dumper not the dusty so the person
that I was with just pretty much look
like I don't want to do this anymore
they were younger than me so I guess
because they were younger they felt like
I was kind of taking their fun away and
now that was in my my point at all it
was just more so at the time I just seen
them one in a direction that just didn't
work if you see somebody moving in a
direction is bad you want to be like say
oh you are hoping oh there's going to be
like a nice little train that's gonna
smack your ass towards the end so maybe
you shouldn't do that but they just feel
like I was you know so I don't cool now
I don't know about you guys but when you
get into relationships you also have
like a friendship the person you are
you're in a relationship with them which
are also in a friendship too and that's
the greatest relationships are because
you guys have you know the jokes and the
good times and all that well I thought
once this was over me and this person
would be able to be friends after this
at least you know and continue
and mmm they don't really see it that
way so they started to do one like very
childish dumb to me dad I what's
really pissing me off and it was really
hard to my feelings at the time not to
laugh at it but at the time it was just
like they were ignoring me which was
along like a anniversary date I had set
up and then that didn't work and it was
kind of like I'm kind of good and they
just went from like here to there in
like 2.5 seconds so this is the person I
spent 90% of my time with and now I said
we can't even have a conversation so I
remember and you guys follow me on
instagram you guys may have known that I
posted a picture girl I mean I posted a
video crying any guys I'll try for
anything but I was really in my feelings
but my phones were so hurt and it after
broke up I found out a lot of things
about this person that were later I
didn't know that was going on with them
like just mentally I didn't know that
that there was issues there so I kind of
so bad in a way for certain ways that I
may have reacted and acted for certain
things and because I really do lost a
friend like that wasn't fun to me so
what I had to do because I've never
loved with it before this I had you know
still been cool with people maybe it
just didn't work out or usually when I
get to the phone where I'm ready to
break up with somebody I'd be so far
over it that once it's over I'll be like
thank God now let's move the on but
for this I just was I was in my feelings
so hard and everything just made me sad
I would cry I remember my friend called
me to get some advice and I just broke
down crying she was like I feel bad
because you're the person that I always
call and something is wrong and right
now you're going through this and I
really can't do anything cuz I don't
have anything to say like you're never
this person you're always the total
opposite so what I did to kind of get
over that and now the person seems to
like unmercifully want to contact me for
whatever reason we ain't don't be cool I
think I wish you the best but I wish Joe
asked away a long time ago just like a
lot of times when people do things to me
especially I don't know about you guys
but when you do something to me that I
feel is unwarranted and I still to today
so like that that was just
Foundation did say I will with you
tomorrow I was bummed when she was
blowing some guilt grandmother's that I
fell off a ledge in a wheelchair with a
broken leg I wasn't give a I didn't
do it to you so remember when you break
up with somebody in it and let's just
say you want to be cool and later on in
life make sure that you you in there oh
my goodness on a good note
make sure you in that you're respectful
to that person if they brought some to
na means something to you because if you
act like they don't mean to you
just know that when they get on and they
move all the light there is nothing that
you can say or do it's going to change
how they feel about you you're going to
always be that up in life you're
going to always be that who
brought them so much and drama and
heartache that they don't want to ever
go back and feel that again
so for me I just feel like the person
should have understood that I have no
intentions of hurting you I only wanted
to help you and I'm trying to get now
but looks a little slate so for me what
I did during that time was I ended up
going I think to New York during that
time I don't know and I to print out
there that was real cool he was just a
friend that didn't have done the you
know y'all be hmm but doesn't like that
or whatever we were cool and I remember
we went out and I was out there for
about we got it snapchat nothing on
Instagram anything I just literally just
need to talk away from social media to
just get myself together and what's
crazy is I was so focused on just
getting back to me I didn't realize that
I'm now like low-key about to get into a
relationship with someone else or
whatever what I didn't do right away we
were very cool but he ended up being the
boyfriend that I was now he ended up
being somebody for me that he just got
me he understands me he understands all
the mark my Forks he understands the
thing that pissed me off he understands
that he can get this work if you want to
be stupid um you know it just it's tough
like he Jetsons
he takes enough so it's just one of
those things where you you're in a
relationship with somebody you're when
you love someone is hard to get over
them you know and that's what heartache
comes from it comes from
as you cared you know and for me I
sometimes kill Oh too much okay that's
using my problem so in that situation
what I did was me and him we we
literally like got to know each other
for about a good nine to ten months
after my breakup so we were friends that
was it we didn't we didn't kiss we
didn't hold hands me to do they were
legit just friends and once it was like
a year of us just being friends
he came to me and was like okay been a
year I really want to just get to know
you at a very personal way I want to get
shot like I think you're dope as
which his words not mind his words and I
don't want to get to know you like I
understand what nobody would not
appreciate as a person that you are and
at that time I was just like I don't
want to get in a relationship with
nobody right now baby not today maybe
mom not today so he respected what I had
to say so wasn't it so everything about
a year and life takes like a year and a
half and then at that point we got
together and we've been together ever
since and this was like mm this was it I
bro so at the end of 2019 14 I think so
so all to 2015 we were cool and then
last year we got together we spending
everything but we've been really cool
that's all I thought you guys asked me
to be a boyfriend at that time I was
like I don't know you know like I don't
know like we're I didn't want to put a
category on it but that heartbreak still
to this day hurts my feelings because I
know for a fact that you know this was a
person that I felt was going to be part
of my life forever no matter what
happened and they decided that that's
not what they wanted so I was cool with
that it wasn't into absolute after we
broke up to this person start going to
everybody that I know trying to get them
to get a message to me saying that they
wish that we could be friends and they
missed what was hot and when you hear
 like that you like or what if I was
always then
hell no no I wouldn't they
honor you as a what stop okay the world
could be in and closable to becoming
 this up and I'll
or a pair shoe because I feel like I'm a
forgiving person I'm done forgave the
president for everything that they've
done but I've never I will never forget
what they've done and when you're a good
person and somebody does you like that
you never want to do with them again
that's not something that you just say
hey I want to go put my heart on the
line and say bitch eggs good know so for
me the best I'm not going to say the
best way to get over somebody is to get
under somebody else although that is
suggested to myself and I'm sure a lot
of you but it's again I got more in tune
in what I wanted to do I remember in
2000 2015 was like dawn overhaul I was
doing I was getting all types of samples
done for my dog I just kind of threw
myself into something that would help me
through this time and I had never been
through anything like that I'm thinking
like only on mr. Arkwright side my
feelings have been hurt but it never was
to that severity like ever like I went
into doc and I'm never gonna watch
movies and people like I'm just my heart
is hurt I wanna die I never know but as
there is no it was that now I get it
now I understand how people and we were
only together for about a year almost a
year to the day I can only imagine how
people feel after five years of being
with somebody or you've been in a
marriage with somebody for years and you
know this person since she was a kid I
understand why it's hard to detach from
a person that that you spent all of your
time with you know saying a lot of times
when you're younger like that and you
spent a lot of your adolescent years
with someone and then you grow up you
know and I had to learn in that
situation I have to allow people to grow
if I see somebody getting the walls and
the first thing I'm going to do is a
druid but again I have to let them go
through those things because I will do
those things you know and I don't think
you know I can tell you how bad it feels
to get a weed put until you get a weave
you ain't going to stand that penny okay
so sometimes you have to let people you
have to let them go to let us why and I
wish the person the best I really do
I just don't let them nowhere near
anything that I'm doing nowhere near me
nowhere near you know any of those
things that mean something to me now you
know saying whether it be the person
that
I feel like I'm going to marry one day
or just I don't want that energy because
if you understand that people make
mistakes I really do it happens we all
do it but there are sort of mistakes
that I'm not going to make towards
people that mean something to me you get
what I'm saying like I'm not going to
put myself in a situation and dog out
somebody that I feel didn't deserve it
you know if ever there's an issue with
me or somebody I'll come to them and say
hey this is a situation like I said it's
the first time I ever been dumped so
maybe that's why sick a little bit
harder but I think it wasn't even just
back because I kind of felt the thing
with it they felt like the relationship
was eventually gonna expire but I wanted
to afford to expire on good terms they
decided that yeah that's what I want to
do that's what they said but that wasn't
the actions that they took so getting
over heartbreak
my best advice to any of you who's going
to go through this or been through this
is put yourself first you know a lot of
times we have a tendency in
relationships who want to help another
person especially if you select the
other person is less knowledgeable then
use a lot less going on just they're
trying to find out who they are so
you're kind of seeing a little bit of
yourself oh and becomes a little bit of
a charity like a build a bitch because
you're trying to help somebody become
the best them but if they don't want to
do that then you should never put
yourself in a position where you're
forcing who you are and what you do and
what you believe in what you see them to
be to own them because then they find a
many for presenting you after a while
and sometimes people are just apples and
they don't realize what they got until
it's gone
and then at that point is just to it and
I'm saying so do you and when you get a
relationships
understand that you don't matter I kind
of lost myself a little bit and as much
as I do videos about self-love and all
that I'm still a human so I still make
mistakes too and I was one of the things
that I had to learn because even now in
the relationship that I'm dealing with
now whenever there's the issue got off
to a little bit about I'd be like on
hello yeah call me call me cuz know call
me back because I don't like it host and
he don't care because he know for a fact
that I wouldn't do this unless I really
felt some type of way about it if I just
feel anyway
about it then he went you know calling
the text about it but that also is how
our relationship is - because he's not
going to say I'm tired of hearing this
but get out of here Nitin don't do it
again
come I was complaining about just
nothing it needs to be a reason so you
know but just understand and be open and
learn from your mistakes from the past
and see it for what it is given time I
didn't get why this was happening it was
that why why for you why that's hot so
but then later did I realize it's all
happen because that wasn't for you that
was an experience that you needed to go
to that was something that you know was
going to help you but that wasn't all
for you and I'm good now no I am so
happy that was so true so I hope you
guys got something from this just love
you and understand that heartbreak no
matter how hard is hurting for you at
the moment it's gonna go away cuz I'm
the happiest bitch I've ever been right
now in the situation I'm in at this
moment okay so I hope you guys enjoyed
this and I will catch you in my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
