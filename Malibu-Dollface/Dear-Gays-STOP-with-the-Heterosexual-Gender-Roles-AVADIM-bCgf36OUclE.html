because I haven't did one in quite some
time and I risk guys on Tuesday so I
posted a and Twitter status that I
couldn't lose because it was too long on
Instagram and it pretty much was saying
everybody especially with when it comes
to the a community things get a lot of
shallow um and what I've noticed is I
always see people complaining all one
goes cuz you see two dudes kissing he
could be whooping his ass and he could
be stealing his money you don't fuckin
know that's why we y'all get on my
nerves with the bullshit the goal is to
be your motherfucking self and figure it
the fuck out not gonna be just like them
I wanna be all know what the fuck they
doing bitch he probably whooping tires
every day you don't know goes my ass but
anyway you often see people complain
about not being able to find anybody but
that's what happen when you fuck
everybody you always end up on a short
stint of the lace and everybody talking
about your sexual endeavors that you can
have with the whole motherfucking
community but that's for here there so I
pretty much was saying you so worried
about what a person looks like and how
you going to be perceived by the public
you don't take out the time to get to
know the person their aspirations their
goals
and they got a job they got a fucking
debit card if they motherfucking social
security number is theirs you know you
just don't know and then you hear people
he stole for me he did this but did you
take all time to get to know this person
or did you fuck them get with him
because he looked good on your arm we
make a cute couple
yeah that's great but trying to find a
cute a wonderful soul mate how about
that okay
and I get you don't find you got to go
through a lot of frogs who trust me I
don't kissed a whole motherfucking
keeper toads but that doesn't mean that
you become cold-hearted and then you
start to do things because other people
are saying I see far too often people
sit back and complain complain sit back
and complain about not being in a
relationship only because they see other
people are doing it
Oh imma be out of hope I don't like I
told y'all I don't understand what this
thing is
oh I fucked you on y'all man this is me
leaving your man's house this is me
after I fuck your daddy like it's just
all this stuff that becomes so demeaning
and this comes from a lot of people who
they have this very crooked way of
thinking about relationships they get
hurt once or twice and they feel like
their life is over and I get it I've
been heartbroken before too but let me
tell you something at the end of the day
trying to impress strangers does nothing
for you okay living your life
vicariously through the next person
isn't always your best if you see
somebody doing something that you don't
do there's a lot of my friends who do a
lot of shit that I'm just not into
period and that's fine that's you you do
what you do you do how you do it you do
who you want to do it but I'm not here
to judge you cuz I'm not perfect by a
long shot but I carry myself um a
certain way and if a person does not
carry themselves that way they're not a
bad person they're just my mother come
over and we can still be friends I'm
just not don't invite me until none of
your little rendezvous um but a lot of
times I see that a lot of within the gay
community a lot of if my friend is doing
it I'm doing it so I'm not going to date
him because he's a bottom and again if
your sexual preference is what it is we
are not straight people people okay so
if you are gay and for whatever reason
you have tendencies that are not like
how you appear on the outside that's
your business
the great thing about we have up be
together up in first place let them tell
it okay so for you to go out and get it
do because you look like Vin Diesel and
he look like being raised and you think
that that's what the society sees
because you don't want nobody to see you
with the Queen that would be mean you
feel as if I'm a date this type of do
not because I'm attracted to him or I
like him but because my society says the
group in which I come from say that's
who I should date because if I date
somebody who just made like Beyonce
Aaliyah Brandi May like a little bit of
makeup a little lipstick too much hair
then I'm gonna look like I'm not more of
a man than he is and I feel like a lot
of times in the gay community we get
caught up on June
Rose you are not a woman okay let's just
make that clear I not a woman
the do that you win ain't normally we
all dudes when Olli is there for the
lesbians okay
and that's another story but that's not
your lane okay so if you are not in a
traditional relationship then why are
you following traditional things why do
you have to have a girl in a
relationship in the boy in a
relationship you say you want to be gay
you say you want to be free you say you
want to be happy you say you and living
is nice beautiful rainbow but when all
is said and done you don't you want to
live like a straight person you want to
follow these same rules that have been
pulling your parents and your cousins
and your homies and your brothers and
your sisters you're the gay one be gay
be happy be free
stop living in this bubble where you
feel like you have to follow everybody
else's lead that's the problem
everybody wants to be a follower and not
a leader you see that bitch do anything
you want to do it now all of a sudden
your friends can jump on following that
ain't cute okay so I see the frustration
is dating it's already a issue within
itself okay it ain't just us gays I
search people go through it too but what
I do find is that the gay community is
making it harder to date because you're
putting all of these I can't I can't I
can't I can into a bucket and then
you're pretty much blocking what could
possibly be a great opportunity for you
he don't look like I want we all have
our fantasies okay but let's come back
to reality everybody ain't gonna be
motherfucking who the fuck you dream
about every night okay the rapper that
you like ain't chill man okay the actor
that you like ain't probably gonna look
your man ain't probably gonna look shit
like that however if the dude is
respectful if he gives a fuck about you
if he wants to make sure that you okay
if he loves you unconditionally Wigga
not if you love you would make up or not
if you love you with you what you have
and you don't have which you're worth
which you're not worth that is when you
start to make proper decisions about
being loved and that's when they become
goals goals are things that you put
forth and you make
happen not things that you look at and
you aspire to be based on the next
motherfucker okay because let me tell
you something there's a lot of
motherfuckers that I see online that be
yelling goals and the people that
they're talking about that are so so
goal-oriented don't have nowhere to live
they don't have any money they're always
on somebody couch their shoes are stolen
they landing back to you what the fuck
they want to post on Instagram so again
like my granny should tell me don't
worry about how the Joneses get it
because you don't know how to heat it
and how to fuck they keeping it either
so you are you you follow your only you
follow your own path to be your own
person just because you're gay does not
mean that you cannot be having
flamboyant and loud okay that's a great
thing about our community we can do what
the fuck we want
how the fuck we want any fucking way we
want to so stop trying to let these
little sissies out here who have nothing
to do but be upset and because they
didn't fuck the world they want you to
feel like you can't date this person or
do this or they go call you this and
people gonna look at you and I'm not
into that type of dude let me do
something right now
if I found somebody who looked just like
me with the golden shopping together
okay cuz if they was just like me and
respected me wanted to be with me and we
was cool that's cool I mean hey call me
crazy call me what you want well and
when all is said and done it's about
your connection not about this this is
great this is what catches my eye but
this is what keeps my you get what I'm
saying this is what keeps me here what's
in here not this cuz this can be fucked
up tomorrow
this can be going tomorrow that you
gonna be sitting back thinking damn he
only wanted me because of what I look
like not who the fuck I was when you get
you a lot of younger or younger you're
gonna understand it when you start to go
through shit and you're dating somebody
you're gonna start to see how much they
really care about you
when you need them to just be there as a
listening ear you get what I'm saying so
stop trying to follow what you you try
so hard to find for don't fight for gay
rights and then start doing straight
shit that's like me yelling about how
being so natural and I love being
natural and then I try to run and say
ain't nothing like that good old 30
four inches of Brazilian straight bitch
which one is it
you get what I'm saying so it's it's
that be happy be able to express your
life and sometimes when you do start to
open up those gates of love and
opportunities and people that you
normally would not I'm gonna tell you
right now when you open up to those
people that you normally just will shut
out things change and the saying goes
when you change things change when you
stay the same everything stays the same
so keep that in mind
don't be a person who sits back and let
somebody who could possibly be great for
you pass you by because you're listening
to your bitter ass friend who's fuck the
entire community and don't want you to
be happy because I need somebody to go
out and be sluts with just say stop
yelling about you want to be in a
relationship but dudes is just this and
this is what do you bring cuz it ain't
just a fall it's something about you too
you know again I've had my fair share of
relationships I have my fair share of
drama I've had my fair share of idiots I
have my fair share of people I want to
shoot their motherfucking face I've ever
seen you got the red light but that does
not mean that I have cut off my
opportunities of love I haven't it's
just that you have to allow yourself to
grow out of being a child because kids
are the one who worry about this kids I
want I want to play with you because of
what you have not who you are okay
adults do a don't shit so it's a lot of
adults out here with kid Mines kid
mentalities and you have to break free
of that if that's your core and the
people that you're kicking it with and
that's all they care about it how fun to
do it is how big his dick is on how much
money he has if your trick on you or not
then were not the friends that you need
because let me tell you something as
soon as he finds something a linear then
you you will be old news okay so do you
want to live your life with having to
lay on your back to get somebody to like
you or do you want to live your life
getting your own motherfucking shit and
if somebody decides they want to add to
what you already have then that's great
the one thing that I love so much about
Barbie is that no matter what whether
she's with Ken or not she got her shit
he asked
what he's not it there is a difference
so think about that okay because I see
too many bitter people on Instagram and
ain't nobody has deuces this and uses
that don't categorize everybody because
we can say you a whole you ain't got
shit to show for it but some followers
we could but that's not very nice so
think about it don't follow don't follow
and my straight followers I want you
guys to get confused is me saying that
that's not bad thing to follow it's not
but being gay is is a different
especially dating it's different then I
had a reception relationship because a
man and a woman's especially private
parts
everything has a point if you have the
same thing then you have options you
don't you're stuck with that option okay
so if you're not there and you don't do
that then and you want to be different
then be different but don't sit back and
allow yourself to be stagnant and you
can keep them planing about the same
thing so let me tell you by time you hit
30 and you still talking about the same
shit there's a lot of people who are
your same age you're gonna look at you
like you need to get grow the fuck up
and get a fucking life because you're
saying just like so hope you guys
enjoyed this one um think about what I
said my fellow gays I love everybody but
I just had to say I had to get that
above my heart get y'all in next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
