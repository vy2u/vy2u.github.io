you guys in a new year I was gonna start
doing videos based on things that I
personally felt and I personally feel
that it's time for me to say something
about this whole Kimbrough situation now
I'm gonna do a lot of cursing there's
gonna be a lot of derogatory language
and everything else in between so you
know everything if you don't like it
click off the view not one for the rants
click off I'll catch you in another one
so this video is about the drama with
Kim Burrell if you don't know who Kim
Burrell is she is a quite poignant
figure in the gospel community and she
has a beautiful voice I think Kim
Burrell is definitely instrumental and
people like Brandi and Fantasia and
Jennifer Hudson and um jazmine sullivan
you know she has this she has a very
poignant and very distinctive voice and
Whitney Houston was of course a huge
supporter of Kimberlin solonai up until
a couple of days ago yes FYI
it's the first and my fucking Christmas
tree is still up but I'm gonna get it
down later on tonight or tomorrow bitch
don't rush me and it's lit so here's
here's where the problem came in Kim did
while she was somewhere with herbs on
you know come ashore I guess and she was
having this conversation with the
congregation about gays and often in the
Christian community there are times when
you're going to end up in a situation
where you go to church somebody asked
you to come to church whatever the
situation is and then you feel people
legit throwing shade at you singling you
out through the whole sermon now I'm
going to use examples in this situation
not every black churches like this so
please for those my church done are
talking about your fucking church if
that's the case I'm not talking about
you okay
so my issue with this is the fact that
she went into so many different things
like this this was not a I feel like
this about this group of people because
I want them to be better this sounded
like I want to fucking but I want
everybody everyone last one in my focus
to die because
you seem like a scorned woman who called
her husband and the bed with another man
that's what I'm taking it from short
story when I was in high school my first
year I had a math teacher I never in my
life had experienced having issues with
a teacher I was always a good student
and I just couldn't figure out why she
didn't like me now I didn't I wasn't
doing my work but most teachers be like
yours you don't wanna do it shit I mean
I got all these wheat I live in
California we gotta fucking classroom
about 60 fucking kids
so bitch who ever want to take it take
it so she just kept fucking with me and
I couldn't understand why it wasn't
until I checked out of the school then
my friend told me oh the reason she
liked it was cuz she was gay and she
found out that her husband had been
fucking her brother and she has this big
thing where she just can't say anybody
who's gay so that was her reason and so
I know when things are vindictive I know
when somebody saying things from a place
of concern and help versus hurt and
hinder and that's right what I felt like
this was her situation I do I feel like
she is to point of a person in the
gospel community and the black community
to sit back and say things and then
would kill me about it
she went into kind of details about
there is no reason why man should have
another man's penis in his mouth and
your point was to say this about people
who were gay then why did you have to
get so graphic about the sexual act in
which they do we're all pretty there
when I think about Michelle Obama and
Barack Obama I don't think about them
fucking I think about two people being
in love so she should have kept it there
so this also let me know that this was a
personal attack she personally felt away
she's out of shape she's bad body built
like a motherfucker she's not that cute
and say she had a beautiful smile but I
happened just I'm her hair as always
fuck it's been fuck since I could
remember who fuck camera was her she has
always been fucked and the fact that she
wants to gots to be gluten and s control
her front is edge control bitch not weed
control so when I sit back and see
people like her that sit back and talk
shit and think that it's okay well being
gay is a sin okay well if that's how you
feel cool fine whatever it says in the
Bible it says a lot of shit in the Bible
that you motherfuckers don't abide by
let's start
I shall not kill we shouldn't be eaten
pork y'all I had I don't know how many
kids out of wedlock that has never
stopped you guys to say oh you know I
have a problem too or whatever but you
want to pinpoint because it makes it
easier to point the finger at somebody
else she seems like a bitch who can't
get dick she seems like a bitch who
cannot motherfucking keep a man she
seems like an angry ass bitch who's that
her asked up on that motherfucking stage
because she was on her soap box and
everybody that was in that congregation
and sitting there watching her agree
what she felt so they put the battery in
her back but she didn't probably realize
that some dumbass bitch who was over
there own an iron a man in which she was
recording this and you supposed to be in
house of the Lord why are you recording
yuto's be here to hear the word because
otherwise you could have watched my
fucking Joel Osteen on fucking TV and
called it today this there was no reason
for you to come into the house to record
this bitch at her terrible ass
motherfucking Sunday's worse talking
shit about a group of people that she
has worked with that's what's killing me
about this she's worked with these
people here's what gets on my nerves she
I don't want to hear the word yes
anymore bitch let me tell you something
and whoever get offended by this is fine
most straight women now use gay lingo as
if they invented it and it's what it is
everybody and they mama was slain last
year everybody was hair with leg last
year everybody got their life last year
everybody sounds like a motherfucking
everybody's quoting in Paris is burning
let's keep that really 100k if you don't
know what Paris is burning is Google it
but when all is said and done is that
what kills me about this situation is
that it's the people in our own
community who do stupid shit like this
and people think that her behavior is
okay but somebody's gonna have an issue
with me calling her a bitch
and I don't give a fuck bitch you and
that bitch can go jump off a fucking
bridge together cuz that's how many
fucks I personally give about you or her
bad body built ass you and her
Decepticon shake that can go off in the
sunset and have nice motherfucking and
bigoted texting I don't give a fuck
because here's the thing that kills me
about the black community in a black
church and Christianity
somebody said in the comments cuz she
apologized but she apologized because it
hurt her too
which is probably ran by somebody gay um
told her that she should apologize
somebody said a real Christian wouldn't
apologize oh wait my question is what
the fuck is a real Christian because all
the Christians I know are bigamous all
of them most of them are there they
fornicate like nobody's motherfucking
business most of these bitches got more
fucking damn babies than alive babies so
what is a real Christian you said you
explain that to me because I'm confused
what does that mean what does that
entail what does that look like
because bitches like Kim Burrell is not
a real Christian you're supposed to be
living by the book you're not supposed
to judge nobody if you felt this
strongly about the gay community would
show stupid ass should've did grab
somebody and say if you need my help I'm
there for you that is what a Christian
does but you want to sit up here with
your little half swing on and think that
she was doing something because you got
a new pair of Uggs for Christmas bitch
and it's stealing again
the Fupa in the front and the fubÃ¡ in
the back does not make you a bad bitch
Kim just so you know gays have been in
the industry lord have mercy this is the
thing I don't like the fact that people
want to make it seem like being gay is
new but we just like we knew like we
started with frontals or something like
we just started in the last couple of
years or people just got hip to us know
gay people have been around for eternity
bitch and we're not going anywhere so if
you want to keep pinpointing and you
want to use a book to condemn somebody
to hell I'm gonna tell you right now in
the black community there's a lot of
motherfucking bitches who remember their
sons be murderers rapists child
molesters then be a faggot and I'ma tell
you dad that's not God's honest truth
and you know why because they feel that
the D masculine of the man is so
disrespectful let me tell you something
right now there are more gay men and
trans women out here who got more heart
than them so called you niggas I'm gonna
just tell you right now because a lot of
you motherfuckers who claim to be so
hard and so this and so that y'all can't
even walk in your fucking truth you are
doing jobs based on this bitch's opinion
you motherfuckin going to school because
your granny wanted to see one of her
grandkids graduate well you should have
told that bitch you should have did a
little better with your kids bitch cuz I
got shit to do
I'm not living my life for biggest like
Kim Burrell and anybody else in between
and I'm not saying that she doesn't have
a right to have an opinion but if you
know for a fact that you're on a
pedestal of some sort and people look up
to you especially being a woman of the
Lord then you should have took a
different route honey because of your
delivery was a little bit different this
wouldn't be a problem so apparently
she's gonna be going on Ellen and I
don't know how that's gonna go um coz
Ellen sometimes gets on my nerves cuz
she want to kind of skim over and be the
peacemaker but I feel like in this
situation you have to be accountable for
what the fuck you said I know say every
motherfucking thing that I feel on
camera everything that I feel in my
heart I don't put out to the world
because I could offend someone I can
disrespect someone I can hurt someone's
feelings based on my personal you don't
have to know everything that I feel so
when all is said and done I'm sure
there's a gay dude who'd beat that bitch
ugly ass face I'm sure I'm sure somebody
had to figure out how to put that
motherfucking wig on that big-ass head
and that low-ass Real Housewives of New
Jersey a hairline of hers
I'm sure so when all is said and done
don't bite the motherfucking hand who
feeds you bitch because you already
motherfucking on fashion police's
biggest fucking list so i'ma let you
know right now the shit that you have on
and the fact that nobody's gonna want to
fuck with you now good luck in 2017
bitch cuz you to start this motherfucker
off with a big fire big roar and I don't
care who's mad because here's my here's
my issue people want to always try to
come for gay people and I don't
understand what the problem is most of
you bitches don't even have a driver's
license most mostly you bitches don't
even know your fucking baby daddy is but
because you are not gay you feel like
somehow you are better and what kills me
about that there are people who are not
black who for the same thing the same
way about y'all as she black ass too but
it shouldn't somebody say something
everybody want to get up in the uproar
and everybody's mad
so I'm mad too now how about that and
for all you bitches want to talk about
you want to care about gay rights and
not black right I care about all
motherfucking rights but i'ma tell you
one thing like this indicate community
we got more motherfucking unity than we
can do in a black community I'm gonna
tell you that right now cuz you got
bitches like her talking shit thinking
that she better than somebody with her
gluttonous ass and she did you just feel
like she just ditched girl and this
not just her there are big churches big
mega churches who sit back and do this
every fucking Sunday and as soon as he
get his own raggedy ass with a receding
hairline out that pulpit what he does is
he takes his ass off that motherfucking
stage he goes fuck some girl who's up
underage
fuck some boy who's up under fucking age
go fuck his wife end up with something
hello Bishop Eddie Long and then you sit
back and you and nobody wants to say
anything about it nobody wants to say
anything now Shifu shaded Eddie long
Eddie long has been flipping it for
quite some time so it's about time that
he got his but when all is said and done
don't try to act like this shitting in
your motherfucking faces and you don't
see nothing I know bitches grannies who
go to the motherfucking Church just too
motherfucking stunned a new Star Wars
2.0 motherfucking hat so that Gertie can
be on and on and giving her side on that
mission coming here to motherfucking
word she have a business motherfucker to
start shit and be a typical ignorant
bitch just like him Burrell's ass that's
what you do so if you don't want to be
in a motherfucking window you don't want
to be smoking a certain way you don't
want people with the world to see you a
certain way stop fucking acting like
that what is the problem what a way that
the world sees me
what's the shut the fuck up what is it
I'm gay I am black I am happy I am nappy
okay and I'm not gonna apologize to none
and motherfucker especially especially a
bitch whose motherfucking hair line is
too motherfucking centimeters from her
goddamn eyebrow bitch never so
understand this in the new year I'm
gonna say a lot about how I feel about
my fuckers who want to suck it stop
coming for the gay people because every
time you come yo ass is gonna get a
motherfucking cease and desist
a return to sender and we gonna like
show ass up each and every motherfucking
time because I'm gonna tell you this
right now being black ain't going
nowhere
being gay no going nowhere and
everything in between and going on
motherfucking where so if you want to
keep on talking about this you want to
keep preaching from this good old good
book that you never abide by then keep
it cuz every time you hit me with
something bitch I'm a motherfuck i'ma
put witty little Kim say about Nicki
Minaj bitch imma put my motherfucking
foot on your neck and I'm now letting
the fuck up until I feel like it that's
what I'm doing okay
so for all of you and the reason why
this gets me so angry and upset is
because she is a woman in a position or
that she should use this for the
betterment of something and she's using
it for the wrong reasons
so everybody wants to talk about
something you know what you do was on it
no she's been blessing abundance in a
lot of us have a lot of you bitches down
here mad about what the fuck you didn't
get for Christmas a lot of you bitches
mad because your boyfriend your
ex-boyfriend got a new bitch and now you
trying to be on her page to be on some
petty shit a lot of pictures want to act
like they so mature and they do so much
no living your fucking truth a lot of
you bitches don't do shit but quote the
scriptures that you want a motherfucking
quote while you got a whole fucking baby
cemetery of fucking babies that show ass
didn't motherfucking half and it wasn't
nothing wrong with you you would be an
irresponsible bitch so therefore you got
a lot of shit to answer to - so don't
try to sit up here and make it see I
never murder nobody okay
so the fact that you got a whole
motherfucking hood of niggas babies
laying up somewhere and God's heaven you
got an answer to that so don't ever in
your motherfucking life think that you
better than somebody because you don't
do what I do
alright everybody wants to make it seem
like I'm doing the worst bitch I am
living my motherfucking life being free
and fucking happy and that's why I am
blessed abundantly because I treat
people the fuckin way I want to be
treated
I don't give a fuck what you look like
where you come from respect this fucking
respect but you got a lot of
motherfuckers out here especially in a
black community who feel like somebody
should give you something
you your old something nobody owes you a
motherfucking thing and as soon as you
get that shit straight you'll be better
off period everybody wants it and you
know Kylie Jenner is always you know
using a cultural appropriation and ma
ain't 99.9 of you bitches and mother
fucka 2016 was using gay
cultural appropriation but I'm
motherfucking made no memes about it cuz
I don't care that much but that's how
petty bitches think so I'm tired of
hearing excuses as to why bitches like
Kim Burrell get a pass for being a bigot
but when I say something you know what
I'm just
respectful your mama would be ashamed my
mama is quite happy my granny is quite
proud my father that I know is quite
proud so I don't have a problem with
being honest about Who I am and where
the fuck and the person that I stand in
because it takes more motherfucking
shrimp to be who you are then it will
ever take to be a fake-ass bitch like a
lot of these holes that are on the
internet they want to talk about shit
I know bitches it was like I think that
gate you know gay marriage is wrong
being gay is wrong but then you fucking
bitches to appease a nigga who ain't
even your nigger
so what are you saying but people have
been programmed to believe that oh well
because I do it it's a mistake when you
do it is just wrong what being gay is
these demonic spirits I remember once I
was in church in this guy the pastor
said there's a lot of demonic spirits in
in here and I was like I'll show you
after demonic spirit meet me out the car
nigga how about that demonic spirit all
right show ass up like you see what I'm
saying
you're opposed to go to the church to
get the word on me happy that's why I
tell a lot of y'all I'm not really
religious like that but I'm very
spiritual as a person I have my own
relationship with God and I don't need
bitches like him Burrell and creflo
dollar's old crooked ass and everybody
else in them in him and him no and this
I think about it is a lot of you
dumbasses give y'all fucking money to
these crooks you you you can't even keep
your motherfucking electricity on but
then you giving this motherfucker all
your money in hopes that you're going to
be blessed because he's a false prophet
aren't you not supposed to believe in
false process he's supposed to give the
Word of God that's what he that's his
job he's not supposed to be out here
robbing motherfuckers why do your path
to need a Lamborghini why where is he
going
most of these niggas pants in the movin
a motherfucking belly anyway if he was
gonna catch a bitch you couldn't get the
shit out so I don't matter but again
you're stupid and you do shit like this
and then you believe and you perpetuate
the shit that they say to other people
to believe that you're here and they're
here but I'm here to tell you right now
we all live in here baby we all live in
here
and when we all die we all gonna be
judged just like this and I can
guarantee you when you do have your day
of judgment God ain't gonna add show
stinking ass shit about me okay so all
y'all who give a fuck about gays and I'm
trying to give it a listen
though God doesn't need you to do his
work okay he doesn't need an understudy
you could never be so let it go I'm
gonna leave it there but I just had to
say that because it's just getting
ridiculous like this is just it's
irritating me bitches want to bite and
do everything you know all these things
all these drag bitches is contouring
through the motherfucking you know and
again I have no problem with women doing
what the gays have done because we do
this vice versa but don't act like
you're better because you're a woman and
you're not gay don't do that because I
there's a lot of shit that I could pull
from you and a lot of these bitches if I
pulled that motherfucking contour that
frontal wall bitch a lot all of you the
original view will show and we ain't
trying to see that
okay so again shriek people like you
want to be treated no matter what they
come from what they do and any anything
in between because a lot of people out
here live in fosston a motherfucker but
feeling like they are living better than
anybody and i'ma tell you right now as
soon as your raggedy ass got it they can
take it away
and I'm gonna tell you she wants to gay
people to die all y'all gonna die in
2017 that's not what she meant she
apologized bitch keep your motherfucking
apologies bitch cuz as she was just
about as low as your fucking hairline
nobody fucking cares
I just never been in the position where
I was sit back and give a fuck about
motherfuckers that I really just don't
care about if I wait somebody else
problem what the fuck do everybody care
you ever noticed when somebody has
something to say about somebody gay you
gay
yes is there questioners at are you
asking are you inquiring or are you
telling I don't I don't like you saying
it like it's such it has such a
derogatory like connotation behind it
because people use it that's very gay of
you pick another word bitch cuz that's
what I did cuz if I said that was very
nappy headed black bitch of you then all
of a sudden I will be very respectful so
again it's the best not about what you
say is
you say because when people say when I
use the word gay they use it in a way
where is to explain or say something
that is negative so if I said that's
very black of you and I wasn't black you
would take that as a pinch right so I
don't think people get that well being
gay is not the same as being black
because being being black ain't a choice
i'ma tell you right now me being gay was
not a choice okay life chose me I did
not choose it and I'm gonna tell you
something right now praying the gay away
does not fucking work I could pray these
motherfucking bills away but I can
guarantee you when the first head dead
motherfuckers are unabie do then I can
pray it to my motherfucking knees it's
red but I'm gonna tell you right now you
are who you are there are people out
here playing with them but I'm gonna
tell you from a bitch like me and
everybody that I know we've been like
this all our motherfucking life so we
cannot change who we are and if it is so
easy and it is a choice for all y'all
who believe that go suck it they can eat
a pussy here's a choice right and you
tell me you can do that and be cool with
it tell me show me come back to this
video and comment below that she was
able to do it it was cool it was a
choice because you can cuz it ain't so
let it go
next time watch your fucking mouth and
you don't fuck with the wrong ones I
just hope you know position ain't over
it ain't by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
