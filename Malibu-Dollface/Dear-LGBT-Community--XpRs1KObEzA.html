today is but anyway it's probably
weekend that's pretty much coming up
this weekend and in honor of that and me
being a proud gay man I want to do this
video um a lot of times this video is
not to make anybody feel any type of way
make anybody feel like they're wrong in
their beliefs and how they were brought
up that's not my point in this video my
point is for you to understand that we
are all the same and I'm over I am over
people nitpicking at the gay community
like we don't matter and we don't have
any feelings so if you don't want to
hear about this so you don't feel like
um anything that I can say right now
we're enlighten you on the person that
you are the things that you've done um
then you can click off that's that's not
my point here for you I'm not trying
this is not a convincing convention
that's not what I'm trying to do here so
I just want you to know I'm going to
speak very passionately about how I feel
oh I've posted something on Instagram
and it pretty much said if being gay is
so easy to turn on and turn off since
there's a choice then you turn it your
straightness off and you become gay and
you just say okay you do it you do it
you just just like I became gon want you
to do it and our way and nobody had
anything to say there was a few
naysayers but of course there's always
people who don't have it if they're
having a pan it is just so it's mm-hmm
so my take on this is this I am Who I am
at the end of the day and I'm not you
know y'all don't have no heaven or know
how to put me in so a really good matter
what you think about me anyway
but for the sake of this video we'll
just say that I do care about what you
think about me um it really wouldn't
matter because you don't do anything for
me you don't feed me you don't put money
in my pockets you don't do anything
that's going to help me become a better
individual in the long run if you're
just talking about me disrespecting me
and this is and when I say me I'm
speaking for every person that comes
from my community okay not even just my
community that everybody who comes
from the walk every walk of life you
know everybody who's different that's
what I mean you know I the thing is
people preach you to you your entire
life about being in
individual about being different about
being not like the next person and those
very same people who have preached to
you this this soliloquy about what you
should do to be an individual or the
first people to judge you for it so it
kind of goes to say like are you setting
me up for failure because if I'm not
like you it's a problem if I am like you
that is a problem so it's I'm damned if
I do and I'm damned if I don't you know
I don't I just want to take this
especially I'm doing this video for the
younger generation who may be confused
about their sexuality or what they're
doing or where they're going or whatever
the situation is let me just say this
and then I'm going to let it be what it
is you're not wrong and who you are no
matter what the evangelist at your damn
church say what your mama say what your
daddy say what your 80 year old
grandmother have to say at the end of
the day your life was given to you for
your for you okay for you
okay and I'm not gonna say this in a
disrespectful way but I'm gonna say
them and what they're going through
because nobody's here to please them I'm
not here on this earth to please my
mother I'm here to please the Lord
that's why I'm here to please so if you
believe in the Lord
I love rosemary whoever you know I'm
saying whoever Rosemary's Baby you know
marry whoever else you believe in
whatever your God is lewder whoever then
that's who you find that's who you have
to answer to at the end of this not me
not the next person you know none of us
them it's you know today it's who you
will have to pretty much answer to
because at the end of the day people
don't understand our struggle you know
and I'm not one foot to sit here and
talk about everything that I've been
through and oh my god what was me and
I've been through this and I'm sure I
could get a whole bunch of sympathy if I
sit here talk about all the things that
I've had to go through in order to get
to this point in my life you would sit
here with your mom hoping like really
like you I'm not going to do that it's
no because that's not me anymore I'm not
dwelling in that particular moment and
with the gay community that's the issue
that I have everybody likes to play
victim so much is we visiting in it
I'm so sad about this and somebody
called me this and somebody called me
that I have been called every
 thing in the book you let
me book every thing in the
book I have been called from training to
shemail to ladyboy - gay - -
everything that you can think of I have
been called but you know the difference
between me and everybody else is I don't
answer to none of that none of it I'm
not offended by none of it because
nothing that you have called me is
offensive in my book so therefore you
can call me whatever the you feel
however makes you feel just don't put
your hands on me and we'll
be good but if you feel like
name-calling is gonna make you feel
better as an individual and it's gonna
make you feel like you're a better
person than me somehow someway or
whatever situation then go ahead I'm
here to make your day I'm gonna make you
happy this good order you can call me
whatever the you want I don't care
because at the end of the day the words
don't hurt me no more okay the words are
not that I'm learning about you putting
your hands on me that is when I
have a problem but y'all running around
here trying to protest and trying to
talk and trying to have an edge
issue and I probably can somebody the
card you out your name
bitch let me just tell you something if
it's not who the you are then
therefore there's no reason for you to
answer to it if I call you a dog-faced
ugly-ass copy fades bitch and that's not
who the you is that you ain't going
even look in my direction if you are
walking down the street and your name is
Brittany and I call you a ugly bitch in
a blue shirt are you gonna turn around
no because that's not you not ugly bitch
in a blue shirt so all of this
protesting and I'm added RuPaul's Drag
Race because they use the word training
and this is that any other and me in the
trans community is now shut up just shut
up cuz you trying to fight something
that is it's the world you cannot fight
the world on how the they see you
because at the end of the day I'm not
insensitive to the gay community at all
I'm not I get it I'm in it I've been
through it I understand but I'm a
grown-ass enduring as decisions about
what I do and I'm not gonna sit up here
and cry because these who
sit up here and want to call me on my
 name bitch if somebody
even called you or training you a
transsexual and you don't like the
verbage they use that's them why the
 they would do
didn't matter about what the you do
why why is there opinion about what they
call you I don't like to become vicious
go it's a lot of things I
don't like I don't like these bitches
weaves out here but they wearing them I
don't like your make a
bitch what you wearing it I don't like
them tiny ass shoes you got on with them
big-ass feet but you wearing them so it
is what the it is there are
 who don't like me right
now for this weave that I got it but I'm
wearing it so it's gonna be what the
 it is and if you don't like it then
you get your ass on y'all stand up
you're trying to fight the world over
something that they personally feel you
cannot change the way the world is going
to feel about you the only thing that
you can do is live within your truth and
they're going to be who gonna respect
you and they're going to people who
don't respect you and at the end of the
day those are the people that you should
be rockin with the who
don't respect you you should even want
their attention you trying to like you
trying to change the world and this goes
for Carmen Carreras that
because Carmen has lost her
 mind okay
now there's a lot of people from the
trans community who are gonna be upset
because you'd understand what we go
through and this is this is missing this
and this and this we all of them been
through something it ain't just you we
all have been through something your
struggle is no better for mind okay so
if you add it cuz imma just be real
blunt right now no matter what you call
your self no matter how
you try to change the verbage no matter
how much emphasis you put on one
word from the other some people in this
world are always going to see you as a
man period that's it I don't give a
what you get I don't give a how
pink your couch is you are always going
to be a man in someone else's eyes so
therefore instead of sitting up there
trying to label yourself something to
get respect respect yourself who the
 you are and move the on and
let it be what it is I'm sitting you
 sitting up here and I don't
want to be coming saying it because this
is what it is you know what at one point
in time queer
it was a very disrespectful and
derogatory term and we took that
back and now this we got this okay we
use that in every day that that is
something that describes us as an
individual as a community
and that's that at one point that was a
very derogatory you take that back
when somebody takes something from you
and try to use it against you take it
and you turn them lemons into
 lemonade and you let it be
what it is I don't want to be called by
this it's not though with you the world
owes you nothing okay the world owe you
a thing just understand it
they don't owe you nothing so you're
trying to fight the word about respect
you're not gonna get it like that how
you get respect and how you got here and
you show these I'm no
different from you you use your actions
not your words cuz talk is
real cheap you should see
my Instagram it's a lot of
I got some cheap ass talking up on that
 who are making a lot of
announcements but they making no
 moves so it is what the
 it is you can say what you want to
say but it's what are you gonna do about
the situation now there have been people
who have came out and said yeah it's
disrespectful to say this it's
disrespectful to say a lot of
 that said but it's
said and and you me or anybody else
can't change that people are going to
say what they want to say you can't
dictate how another person says but they
say what Carmen said was not incorrect
the way that she's carrying herself and
this little crusade against my
the very show that showed
ass was on that got you the platform
that you want to sit back and talk about
you shoulda did this and you shouldn't
daddy did that in a room didn't do this
Andrew didn't do that bitch where in the
 was where were you before RuPaul's
drivers you tell me that you tell me
where the you was because the last
time I checked bitch you was on the
Battle of the seasons you
was on the our cruise for
RuPaul's Drag Race so it seemed like
every check you got with
the exception of two or three has
RuPaul's name at the end of it so before
you bite the hand that feed
you remember where the you came
from because before nobody knew who the
 you were Chris let's just make that
rumor and if anybody is offended by the
way that I'm running on coming right now
you can get your ass up and leave too
because I don't believe in disrespecting
people who have made a wait for you
period
regardless of your personal feelings
about how the they feel if you feel
that strongly about it if you were such
a bad bitch in you was carrying your
 you should have took your
 ass to write a comp you
should have took your ass to muffin the
muff others who make RuPaul's Drag Race
how about that you should have took your
issue to logo not RuPaul if you don't
know rule like that you don't know rules
so there
for that to attack him and say anything
about some somebody who's giving you
nothing but a platform to be where the
 you are
I'm over it this is the issue that I
have with a lot of the african-american
community and this is the issue that I
have with the gay community is that
everybody wants to play victim when it's
convenient for them you don't you ain't
on this crusade when you calm each other
niggas and you guys sitting up here
talking about light-skinned versus dark
skinned you don't care about the racism
then but when it involves your
 ass in it or anybody wants
to get together if you're gonna stand
for something you stand for that
and you do not step down from it don't
stand your ass up when it's convenient
for your well-being now I'm not gonna
talking your around Carmen because I
could really go in and on her but
I'm not going to do that because I do
find Carmen
to be a very beautiful trans woman and
that's if that's what you want I'm not
on cardi out of your name if that's what
you want to be called then that's what
the you want to be called I will
respect you in that that you know the
instance the next is not
going to be so gracious and you have to
deal with that as long as they're not
saying it to your face
and then as long as they're not putting
their hands on you and they're not
stopping your money it it
 matter period because
what's the difference if you're good
this how I feel about it if you're so
 mad about i'ma say this
and imma let it be what it is because
I'm getting real fired up if you were
that mad about RuPaul's
using shemale then you should be mad at
the DMV for putting a woman on your
 driver's license bitch
because the last time I checked you
wanted to be identified as a trans woman
it says you're true just so they're not
identifying you as who you are either
okay so are you or transforming are you
a woman do you want to be Chris or
deetmore Department I mean I'm just I
want to know I want to say because i'ma
tell you right now I've been card
training so many times and it wouldn't
 make a difference because
the trans community I'm not offended by
that so for you to call me that I'm not
gonna sit up here and jump up out of my
seat I was just I would prefer you not
to do that because that's not the
correct verbage that you should be using
because at the end of the day I'm still
up dude
just cuz I look better than your
girlfriend is different so you could say
what it is I don't care but would you
have to understand and what you have to
get it people are going to do what the
 they want to do you can't tell a
 ha
do this and how you should do that and
I'm not telling Carmen that she's wrong
and saying that it's a slur but it
depends on where it comes from because
nigger and nigger nigga nigga it depends
on who it comes from so it just like
that it depends on who it comes from but
for you to say that it's not okay to
call Ellen DeGeneres a lesbian and
innocent Cooper a and RuPaul a
nigger and Carmen career or training
those are things that are not okay honey
that is not the same thing that is not
the same for you to even put
african-american struggles with gay
struggles and trans struggle community
if girl you didn't you overstepped your
boundaries at that particular point
because that struggle is not the same
and the thing that I do not like when it
comes down to certain situations like
this especially in the gay community of
people who want to whine and cry
you can Spence you can stand up for
yourself all the you want I am
proud of everybody who standing up for
our community because standing up for us
has given me a platform to do what I'm
doing right now and have way less
judgement than it would have been 20
years ago people like RuPaul and Amanda
Lepore and Lady Bunny and you know
Laverne all of these people who have
came to our community Anderson Cooper
Don Lemon all these people have helped
people like myself be able to stand on
this platform and do what the I'm
doing
and for a lot of y'all it's judgment
free so I'm not gonna disrespect people
who have come before me to sit you know
and fight them or what the I don't
feel is necessary
cuz if it was that deep in you were that
much of a woman about it then you would
have came to rule like a woman and said
hey you know we as a trans community
don't really think that this is okay did
it no you want to start a
crusade because you want
attention you want attention because you
want to be a Victoria's Secret model
this ain't gonna be it boo this ain't
gonna be your mother this is not
your ticket to be confrontational do you
think that Victoria's Secret is going to
do with you can sue did you do something
that they don't like it's going to be a
problem and that's the problem that I
have with the gay community
a lot of y'all it up for the
rest of us y'all gonna come up here and
just be a
you're the issue and it like to stand up
for some if you want to stand
for something great but make sure that
your cause is a worthy cause and it
benefits everybody else not just
yourself y'all gotta stop that
complaining y'all like so seriously I'm
over it I'm over it is what the it
is if you are a man in a wig if you do
drag if you are a man who are now a
woman if you are one who now is a man
whatever the situation is just make sure
that you own that forever and always in
other people's eyes that is all you will
ever be and you cannot change the
 world just because you
change your gender they're not going to
change their minds if that's the world
get over it grab your nuts no pun
intended and remove the on these
people don't make my life these people
don't do for me if you call me on
my land I'm not gonna cry
I'm not gonna be mad about it so
somebody said well you know everybody
isn't as strong as you and everybody
doesn't have the support that you have
is not nism my social status has nothing
to do with the confidence that I have as
an individual you have to learn that you
can't fight the world in order to feel
at peace with yourself you have to be at
peace with yourself and say the
world that's what you have to do that's
the only way that you're going to be
able to move forward as an individual
period so if I offended anybody in this
video unknowingly I am sorry because
that was never my point but my point is
in a nutshell get the over it and
and learn to be your own individual and
stop letting people's personal opinions
affect you how to you feel about
yourself if you love yourself and you
were able to get up in the morning and
look yourself in the mirror and say I
love me for who I am that's the best
thing that you could ever do and
if he/she or them have a issue
with you about who the you are then
 them with a nice rubber pink dildo
and let it be what the it is
because it really doesn't matter
stop being sensitive because the world
is not dead they're not gonna coddle you
okay stop being sensitive over
dumb it is what the it is bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
