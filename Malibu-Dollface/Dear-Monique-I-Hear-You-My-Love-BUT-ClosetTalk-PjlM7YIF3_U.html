this video which is gonna be about
Monique's Netflix situation a lot of you
guys asked my opinion about it and I've
been pretty like silent about it because
I don't have the most popular opinion
about this so oh well Monique a mom is a
ekat Academy award-winning actress for
her role in precious and she also has a
plethora of other wards that she's won
for that role and other things as well
money is originally a comedian who took
the transition into being an actress so
once the whole precious movie came out
originally it was this big thing then he
had a hard time selling it and then they
actually got his soul and then it became
this like big thing she did her
promotion that she was required to do by
a contract for the movie Oprah Lee
Daniels and Tyler Perry asked her to go
to Cannes Film Festival to promote it
overseas she declined to do so from that
after numerous calls from Tyler and
Oprah she pretty much was labeled
difficult to work with because she just
didn't want to play the game okay
so let's keep that part in mind as I go
down memory lane now cut to now um she
pretty much released a video stating
that she would like for us to boycott
Netflix because of gender bias and um
ageism Womanism everything you could
think of okay now Monique I love you
girl but I am Not sure this one like
auto-pay okay however and I just don't
like to me that's that's not really
gonna do anything um
- I'm not get what she's going with it I
just don't agree but I do have a
difference of opinions and the masses
out here who are just pretty much trying
to drag her fulfill because you just
don't like her or you don't agree with
her she's now being labeled by her own
people in the black community cuz you
know they love you today don't as
difficult and somebody who should just
shut the up and why is she still
talking and while she's doing this and
while she doing that that's pretty much
the consensus around all the social
media that hair
girls Monique again ah okay so okay fair
enough but let's have a conversation a
real conversation that does not involve
her husband that doesn't involve her
gray hair that doesn't involve her used
to being big no let's have a real
conversation about the business and how
things are so most of you who are
watching this video have jobs most of
you go to school so let's put yourself
in her shoes for just a second okay
because the the thing is it seems like
when men do this there's their he
they're not difficult to work with
they're just assertive she's a bitch for
asking what she deserves because she has
one of the biggest accolades that an
actor can be awarded for their efforts
as a person okay so when people get
Grammys being in a Grammy Award winning
artist lets you know that your stake for
producing singing being featured on all
this stuff goes up your money goes up
okay so a lot of people were a more so
upset at the fact that when she made the
comments stating that if she had a dick
Oprah Lee Daniels and Tyler Perry could
suck it if she had one and people felt
like how can you just just disrespect
Oprah Oprah the god
Oprah is not a god Oprah is another
bitch with money okay so if you feel any
way about what I just said and you might
want to stop the video here okay I don't
think that Oprah is a bad person I have
personally nothing against Oprah years
ago I said in a video that I thought she
was unattractive and people pretty much
told me because I didn't have her money
I didn't have the right to say that so
what I'm taking from this is that a lot
of people work on simply money the more
money you have the more respect that you
will get from a person regardless of
what their moral compass is and what the
 they brings to you and add to you
in your community if she got money you
must bow down to her okay Oprah's no
different than Monique the only
difference is their tax bracket okay
let's keep that very clear so if you
believe that somebody who has more money
than you should get and do what everyday
wants and every bitch who got a issue
with Trump should shut the up I'm
only going about what you say I'm only
going about your line of thinking if you
believe that because the person has more
money than you then you y'all should all
love Trump for everything he's doing for
y'all cuz that
nigga Tech bragging is up there but we
don't because you know you see the
quarry as a person right so recently
Monique Oprah was promoting a wrinkle in
time and they asked her about Monique
and she said I will never meet nobody
where they are and that's a very classy
answer as a woman and that's a very
classy answer for a mobile that is Oprah
Winfrey but at the same time honey if it
was Oprah
believe me you she would have a lot to
be said to because let's not forget not
too long ago
Oprah was out of the country I believe
and she decided that she wanted to I
think it was a her med store she wanted
to see a purse the lady that pretty much
was there Roshan racially profiling her
as a black woman who cannot afford the
purse and told her many times that she
was not required to show that purse that
she didn't want to everybody was like
how can you do Oprah like that how can
you say that cuz to you she's God in
other places she's just another woman
now in that situation that was up
and it was very much wrong and I'm happy
that the lady that in what she did was
fired because that's up so let's
apply that same way of thinking to
Monique here's a woman who's literally
done everything okay she's had her own
show she sold out arenas I mean she
sought out clubs okay
she's been in the game since I was
literally a kid I'll be 31 this year I
remember her own comic view okay
this woman has worked her way up from
no-man's land in Baltimore not Baltimore
Baltimore Maryland to be in Hollywood
labeled the fat black woman who will
never be more than just a funny sound
bite has an Oscar and you mean to tell
me that you only believe that she's only
worth $500,000 for two years from a
company who just gave to her
counterparts 20 million apiece if you
believe that that's okay I want you to
apply the same logic when you go to your
job and you've been there for 20 plus
years ten plus years five plus years and
their care come Becky with the good hair
Becky she passed out
drinks
Becky got suckers hang out
here come Becky with the
doughnuts bitch girl Becky God gift bags
and I like Becky Becky cool she she
popular around these bitches back ain't
exactly the smartest cookie in a bunch
but she's getting where she gotta get to
get what she want which is completely
fine so now everybody mama
up her promotion
oh she well John was supposed to get
that promotion but since everybody like
Becky baby Becky got that no a year
later here come Tanya time you've been
working here time in your 12 tobin half
years Becky got it why everybody like
Becky better okay so we got John Tanya
thank God degrees
they worked hard to be here but make you
more popular everybody liked her she
brings snacks love Becky now it's you
now Johnny tanya has suffered in silence
David told you how they felt about this
job they told you about all the work
they put in they decry to you they
didn't told you and you listening they
said none to the boss though they just
took it they took it on the chin maybe
next time now it's your turn you've been
in here 21 years everything you're
supposed to do you run this
like a well-oiled machine
you ain't the highest boss but you close
but no mm-hmm the juice giving bitch she
the one who get your promotion you not
about to just go for that right you
ain't Johnny you ain't on you
you're gonna go to off you gonna
let these know that
regardless of the fact even though I'm
here as an employee I'm breaking my hand
busting my ass I went to school I got my
degree I did everything I was supposed
to do the right way and you mean to tell
me because this bitch is more popular
and the workplace that all of a sudden
that my don't matter to me
tell me you wouldn't have a problem cuz
if you sit up here and say that you
would are you lying
you will be on Facebook Instagram
snapchat Christian mingle black people
meet Mexican people meet my black
planet okay my face you girl you were
being somebody's MSN
messageboards asking what the can
you do to help me so now we go to
Monique she loud she need to shut up she
needs to get over it
see I'm gonna need a lot of y'all broke
people with rich mouths - shut the
up
because $500,000 is chump change to
somebody who is holding an award that
represents that I did my job to the
highest extent that it was required for
me to be so therefore it's like telling
somebody who got a bachelor's degree
that face don't matter all that
time you went to your none of your
degree that you have a bitch you got a
whole shelf full of them but you know
what you don't pass out juice you're not
making everybody up in here laughs so
your don't matter so what was the
point of putting myself in there what
was the point because what y'all don't
understand is some Yahoo asked me before
do you feel like she's worth 20 million
dollars if you call her a legend like
Chris Rock and Dave Chappelle then yes
don't call me something in India if
somebody say that you're beautiful
you're beautiful and then you're
beautiful but I'm gonna give them a
chance and you not you why mm-hmm I just
don't feel like you worth it he's still
pretty but I like the better that's a
cop-out that's it just cuz excuse so if
the people like Netflix said that she
was a legend like the people I just
mentioned why is she not getting legend
money
why was Wanda Sykes who has one of the
well I mean our really big white fanbase
offered two hundred and fifty thousand
dollars well honest I spent somewhere
else and she got an opportunity over
there and whoever's from epics that's
great eeeek and why the psychs
are two separate people and monique is
tired of working
and working and working and working and
working and getting this and getting
that and getting this and still getting
this why am i my stats am here but my
pay is here see if it was all of y'all
y'all would have a problem mostly y'all
don't want to stay off the
work to help clean up y'all out the door
before the store closes
okay so understand there's a difference
when you've literally put in blood sweat
and tears from absolutely nothing from
going to clubs and getting 75 dollars to
do a show to now being an Academy Award
winner and they're still treating you
like you're doing $75 a show so the
other argument was will Monique she's
difficult to work with I can't say I
can't speak to the validity of that but
let's just go with that notion and say
she is who somebody used to people as an
example Christian Bale and Steve Harvey
okay
Christian Bale was on the set if I
believe it was the Dark Knight Rises
telling people that they were stupid
dumb idiots idiotic beneath him and some
a plethora of other things okay
he wasn't labeled difficult it was the
headline for a week was Christian loses
it on a set of Batman ain't her
else he ain't missed a beat since it
seems to me like he's working with no
problems okay we got Steve Harvey tells
the bitch don't look at me don't contact
me don't stand by me don't breathe my
air don't talk my name don't bring me up
don't look me in the eyes bitch okay
send it to everybody a nice little diary
note a little Cliff's Notes don't
with me is what he said headline Steve
Harvey's links to his employees he's
still old family feud right he's still
he bout to do short time as they follow
he's still got the Steve Harvey Show and
you nobody said nothing so we got
Monique
unless she says she did the same thing
what a difference between her and
Christian and Steve I don't believe it
they they have an Oscar okay I don't
believe they have one of those okay so
the difference here is their man and
she's a woman and because she's seen as
the fat black loud woman she's angry and
black because she's asking for what she
deserves
so for all of you who are sitting in
these comments telling her to shut the
 up
you're the same people who would take
pennies that's why you're still on your
job after 25 years and you don't have
nothing to show for it but a little ass
pension and that's it a little bit of a
retirement you busted your ass broke
down your body for these
companies and they're gonna give you
share with you pennies so I don't
subscribe to that
Monique continued to talk continue
to say what the you feel and as the
Academy Award winner you have every
 right to do certain thing and if
everybody cuz the thing that kills me
about this out of all things and that
it's a very people who look just like
her or tell her to shut the up but
it's those very people who had an issue
with a monkey on a shirt
that one of everybody in a mom it's a
boy can't go on hmm
nobody's locations that slow down
including minds you don't want to know
why because you didn't care that much
see Monique is not an asset to you so
let's swap out Monique for Beyonce why
don't we then just I'm just gonna shut
up for my point here Beyonce can't get
out her deal with Columbia let's just
say that's the deal I don't think they
were ever gonna let her ass go cuz she
makes the bank but if hypothetically
pretend question that Beyonce was bike
you know she tweeted my label won't let
me on my deal I want to do music but I
can y'all will take off work y'all would
sell your firstborn
y'all will flash your titties and your
Christian Church outfits y'all will make
sure that your granny's
head was on a platter to make sure that
John se was able to produce a new album
for you host but a woman who ain't never
had shot for nothing
have made y'all laugh the years
it's asking for you to understand like I
said in the beginning this video I'm not
stopping my Netflix that's it I
with Netflix I go to sleep
watching German Holograms okay and I
hate with DVDs however it seems like
nobody even wants to give her the
understanding that she is a person who
is going through something that is
having a issue and she's making this
issue known Viola Davis just said the
same thing but the way that Monique is
going about it I don't think listen
there's a lot of things that people do
that I don't agree with the way that a
lot of y'all come in people's kids in
the same room comments I don't agree
with the fact that you were sit back and
call a woman that you don't know a bitch
alone a because she's had several
boyfriends I don't agree with but that
doesn't still people will understand you
the same bitches who talk about
blac Chyna sucking dick and she bet you
got on a mattress
or dirty mattress with a policy ponytail
by a nigga with a wife and you talking
 see it always makes people feel
better to tell you what you ain't see
when people get mad with me and then you
with everything I love you as soon as
you get an issue with me and I'm a
nigger who will never be a woman that's
fine honey then trust me if I wanted
titties I would have and they would look
better than yours but ma I said all that
to say this learn how to have some
empathy today everybody in their mother
wants somebody to feel and understand
where they're coming from Hollywood is a
beast
okay the machine is a problem all these
women who came out here and said things
about people who have done today
think people have done things to them
y'all tired of hearing it
but when he showed daughter and somebody
on the playground and touch her in a
place that she wasn't supposed to even
know about at that time you want to burn
the school down see that's where the
problem comes in nobody gives a
when it's not them so you mean to tell
me she's only worth $500,000 you
would've took it cuz you got a lot of
broke people with rich mouths talking
they don't know that's the problem so -
you to me I would have said
$500,000 but understand this
this woman has I'm sure a mortgage
family she's taken care of children she
has to take care of and a plethora of
other things so would you really sign
over your life for two years and you can
do else for $500,000 and do you
believe that if somebody told you I want
to give you a corporate job you have a
bachelor's degree you have a disk you
got a degree in social economic I mean
everything and they're gonna give you
the lowest pay that you want to pay your
ass the minimum wage you mean to tell me
you would take it you wouldn't have you
said yes you wouldn't so again do what I
do with Monique is doing right now quite
frankly I can't say cuz I'm not a
comedian who hail from Baltimore who was
called the fat black woman who has
literally climb myself out of little
nothing to get somewhere I didn't do $75
gigs trying to just get my foot in the
door and I'm also not a
Academy Award winner saw with my
 opinion really don't
matter at this point okay because when
all is said and done all of y'all have
had issues with employers all of y'all
have been slighted because of what you
look like who you are and what you feel
and because this woman is telling you
this is what she's going through because
she happens to be a bigger woman she
happens to be known for being loud and
being vulgar all of a sudden all of what
she's going through doesn't matter
because of how you're labeling her so
remember next time this happens to
somebody that you like because all this
is is a popularity contest do I believe
that she should have got what amy
schumer got i can't say because i'm not
in that situation but if i did call her
a legend just like the rest yes she
should have got more okay
so again there's a devalue of the
african-american woman in hollywood
believe what the you want black
panther got
a lot of you bitches out here filling
yourself the same ones yelling from
 Wakanda forever are the same
 that was calling kids
African booty scratcher
it was the same bitches that was sent up
here just a month ago talking about some
I got my ancestry.com back and I'm were
 12% Indian 14% Hispanic I'm 62
percent Laotian and yeah I'm back to you
call a woman of color most of the time a
bitch a black bitch and all she heard
was black whoo black but now all of a
sudden everybody see this is what I'm
talking about you use things like this
as something to say we have come so far
as people hear us roar but yet instill
when it's a person who looks just like
you was literally telling you a yo they
trying to get me they trying to goop the
kid it's girl she better shut up she
 it up for everybody you know I'm
sure somebody told Rosa Rosa probably
told her friend bitch tomorrow
bitch I'm getting up I'm tired you see
these bunnies using these corns bitch I
got gout bitch my feet are
walking on water I'm not getting up and
I'm sure her friend that she told that
to watch them escort her off and said
nothing okay now again everybody fight
is a fight and like I just said I'm not
giving up my Netflix but I can empathize
with a woman who's literally worked her
ass off to be where she is and you
thrown her pennies if you were working
somewhere and somebody came in and took
your mother and again this has nothing
to do with Amy Schumer nothing to do cuz
everything I don't think that Amy
Schumer is funny she has a couple of I
personally for me I think Melissa
McCarthy is way funnier than Amy Schumer
and might be okay but I feel like in
Hollywood there's multiple actresses
that are that are just right that can
have them up there and kill it but it
seems like when it comes to the black
actresses they always want to pit them
against each other and only in the past
year or so have I seen multiple black
women at a pedestal and put up there and
praised by the world at one time and I
didn't started to see this until we got
scandal how to get away with murder an
empire
that's that's when I started to see that
and you seen them more visible but it's
really sad that a man
like Tyler Perry would say that I paid
taraji tomosa she's never been paid but
he never did say if he paid her fare or
not you see what I'm saying you have
people like Tyler Perry who have
situations with Lionsgate who just wants
to produce movies about people getting
aids people getting molested and people
getting raped back that seems to be his
gig but now all of a sudden because
Black Panthers out everybody that looks
like me is saying we say we think of
movies about slaves in a stop money off
we're gonna see 12 years a slave though
nobody told y'all to go see that oh the
critics did right so I did use like a
I'm gonna go see my people make us free
that's what you want to see so again
that's all I gotta say about this
situation all I'm gonna say in closing
is this because you have a woman up here
who was literally the best in her game
getting thrown anything imagine what
your daughter who wants to be a stripper
is gonna get yeah so I hope you guys
enjoyed this I'm Monique if you're
watching this just know I stand with you
I just don't stand with the Netflix girl
I got to watch but I understand and
I think I thank you for making this a
very prevalent and topic of discussion
so next time it does happen people can
understand and so I gonna put Tiffany
Haddish in this and I don't feel like
Tiffany Haddish has anything to do with
this and the whole situation happen with
her and Charlemagne Charlemagne asked me
to be nice with his wannabe beige bitch
he always acts like a bitch period okay
he only with women he only wants
to try to come at women because when
Birdman came up there was we threatened
to sock him in his mouth
he was the radio guy stop supporting
people who are literally making up the
money of the backs of the people like
yourself just just realize who you
support that's all I'm gonna say just
realize are you support because the
people that you think are the funniest
and the ones that you want to Kiki and
lastly when you shoot they're gonna do
the same thing to you remember that and
I will catch y'all in my next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
