falling hair since I've been out all
 night
um I've decided to do this topic
reluctantly because I don't want to
offend anyone I always say this and then
it always turns out being something
totally different I get it I know but um
I have gotten and an abundance of
messages from the natural hair community
um and you know as you guys know this is
a weave um I love it I won't change for
nothing you'll what you say Maile
that's popping thank you um but for
whatever reason okay you guys let's just
let's just start in the beginning when I
first got on YouTube the first thing
that people need or remember me as was
the guy who did the baby here video
that's what I was known for that's cool
by me I don't give a damn um and I had
braids at the time so of course braids
is considered a natural hairstyle okay
cool whatever cut two three four years
later I now was wearing my hair should
my natural hair straight for a little
bit on my other channel which is doll
face Barbie team so you know I'm wearing
my not natural hair or whatever and then
I start to go into wheeze because I
start to see that um my natural hair is
just it's get a little shredder than I
wanted it to be but it was still healthy
I'm still taking care of it like it was
no problem like I don't have a perm I
don't have a relaxer I wear my natural
hair I just happen to wear and not in
this natural state so I've got you
originally I would get messages like oh
thanks for repping the natural community
right and making braids hot and
everybody is trying to copy you and then
it up and I'm like cool what a thing
Europe but I really didn't take heed to
it it was it was kind of like whatever
so now that I mean weaves I get all this
hate mail and these women that I know
they're not girls because these women
are old not old but they're at least in
their 40s and they're sitting on this is
one side card and I've seen a lot of my
pictures pop up in Google searches on
this site yeah and I hope y'all post
this video um oh and I think is
of some hair below my black hair form or
some like that but it's like these
always old women who sit on this board
and nitpick and try to figure out what
is in other people's heads for the
longest time my pictures would pop up on
the site where people basically
critiquing my hair to figure out if I
had a weave if I didn't have a weave if
I was lying if I wasn't lying did it and
I'm like how much time do you really sit
don't you bitches got jobs cuz it how're
y'all got kids so like it's good it's a
government assistance really taking care
of you while you sit down they trying to
nitpick what the is goin up in my
hair so listen I have a very big bone to
pick with every last person on that site
I have a very big bone to pick with
every last person who wants to talk
about people who do not wear their hair
naturally especially in the
african-american community I have a lot
to say because I cannot deal with the if
you're not natural things you're
neglecting your blackness and it's self
hate and how dare you give in to white
supremacy you say that yet you got
Vivica Fox Dina Cali Wendy Williams and
a slew of other bitches out here who
sell hair to the african-american
community okay
african-americans make up 80% of hair
extensions well you don't have to give
it but what look if you have your own
thoughts of how somebody else should
wear their hair then bitch you have way
too much time on your hand because I
don't give a how many grapes
how many nuts how much oil
how much grease how much cash or I don't
give a about none of that if
you want to put the whole
kitchen sink in your hand
bitch that is your business but don't go
around yelling talking to the next
 who got a fly bomb a Swede
and they decided to spend $800 on that
 and anyone a rocket and you got a
problem with it if you want to leave all
the apps you got beat it up
the back of your hair
bitch you do it that's your business but
don't come to a bitch like me and get
mad at the
that I run my head the way that I do
that's not my problem my dear
that's yours maybe you can't rock it
that way maybe that's the problem
maybe you don't have enough edges where
you have you you can't do the side part
maybe later on aren't your thing maybe
you have a problem with all of this
because you're not cute in any aspect at
all and you need to find something to
feel good about yourself
if letting your hair grow natural and
doing nothing to it it's fine with you
it's great with me however I don't want
to hear about you being
 natural when you still dye
your dredges great blonde at the
end that's not natural you wear
deodorant that you put up under your
arms and it goes into your lymph nodes
that's not natural you wear a face full
of makeup that's tested on animals
that's not natural yet you worried about
some goddamn betta beads these bitches
today just got it all up like for
real I don't care what no one else does
with their head there's a lot of people
who weaves are never finished they do
tutorials all the time on YouTube and I
say nothing about it because it has
nothing to do with me so if you got a
problem with a girl who perms presses or
puts extensions braids weaves whatever
in her hair that means that you don't
have enough time of your own and you
kills me is that 9 times out of 10 the
people who talk they're the
 who hair has never done I
don't give a what's your point
maybe if yo ain't never late
whether it's natural or not don't say
 about the next bitch now ain't
nobody came at me I just want to let
y'all know where all this passion is
coming from because they ain't nobody
came in me stupid i'ma
just let you know I heard like people
come to me in a respectful manner and
I'm okay
in a respectful manner like bitch I'm
not gonna fight you how to you feel
however you gonna watch your
 mouth when it comes down
to what the I do because what it
kills me and this is not just the
natural girls either because what kills
me is that girls and some guys like
myself who do where X hair extensions
and you guys want to talk about all this
white supremacy what kills me is
that y'all
on Twitter screaming light-skinned
dark-skinned y'all be on Twitter
screaming Oh y'all hate yourself because
you're out here dying y'all here are
blonde and all this - I'm on Team
black girl team black girls rock are
 like that
meanwhile the same bitch - tweeting it's
got a head for the Indian Air
now limiters on bitch I'm all down for
trying to get your point
across however don't play yourself
because I just made you look
 stupid you want to talk
about this bitch and I love her
 self yet we don't see you
got a full head so in nothing is out no
edges no kitchen no nothin shut up so I
don't understand the whole hoopla in the
end stop and attitudes and all this
not a bitch is hair its
it's protein like really like I don't
have time I don't have time to sit back
and nitpick about something so small
there are so many other things going on
in the world for me to be sitting back
mad at the next bitch because she
decides she wants to wear 12 packs of
Indira me I don't leave that i
don't like pat hair however i'm not
gonna talk about the next vision because
she does wear it that's her business
that's what the she can afford
maybe she don't have a good
relationships with hair companies maybe
she ain't she can't afford to go and buy
four bundles of 28-inch maybe that's all
she can afford so i'm not gonna sit back
and talk about her and then another also
talked about a bitch who decides to go
out and cut all her hair off because
that's what she want to do she feels
good about herself I'm not gonna talk
sit back and talk about nobody who wants
to wear their natural hair in its
natural state I'm not going to do that
because it does nothing for me
it doesn't it what does it move no
mountains and doesn't do anything so
don't go around especially African
American shut up I don't want to hear
about nothing okay yeah whatever you do
on your little boards and stuff that's
cute that's it up it it
 it up I don't care but don't come
to me with the and don't and stop
making videos
about everybody else and how good
natural is and how all this is a bitch
don't give a about that because at
the end of it all your ass
ain't at my house so my hair I'm tell
you is sick as okay it's not bad I
don't have relaxer I don't have a perm I
don't need it but if I wanted to get one
I would get one okay that's why I say in
weaves and I'm him the up
because it makes it much easier to just
deal with this than dealing with all of
this because which you're not going to
do the same bitch just wants to tell me
about how great natural is your natural
 ass hang on be at my house
every morning combing it snappy
now are you know when my starts to
matter when I don't feel like putting
grease in it when I don't feel when it's
getting sweat the out up at the gym
when I go outside and it poops the
up were you then how much you paying you
got think what do you what can I do
because I'm not wearing on with the
 bantu knots I don't do that
That's not me and if you do that more
 kudos to you but that's
not how to I row and a lot of the
bitches I with we don't roll that
way so therefore I respect you with your
afros which your locs with your bantu
knots all that I respect you for that
however do not put somebody else down
because of what they chose to do with
their own hair when it has nothing to do
with you so you can put as many
 berries nuts and
everything else that you want ain't yo
 just don't worry about mine or any
other bitch okay and on that note
I'm through bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
