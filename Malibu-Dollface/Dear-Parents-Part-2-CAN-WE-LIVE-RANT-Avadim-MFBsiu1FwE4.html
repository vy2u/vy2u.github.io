my attitude is set up right now it's a
real stupid I'm on top of this
video can a bitch just live
please so okay this is and this is is
Oliver lace
I feel like regardless of the fact of
whatever the is going on in the
world
if a person asks you to respect what the
 they say and it's not hurting
nobody
respected don't question it don't ask
some other don't ask a bitch
walk just do what the I asked you
to do okay I'm not asking for no money
I'm not asking okay so I was on Facebook
and always throwing Facebook great oh
did you happen so there was a post it
was about a boy and it says a
eight-year-old um
lint on his dream of being a fierce drag
queen and his dad seemed that this was
something that he was interested in and
he loved doing so we all know in the
black community anything that is going
to DD maskull eyes the black man ain't
right there's a little boy in black he's
white
so a lot of people of color were
commenting this one bitch said at eight
years old
yo what the is my cuz it pissed me
off
cuz this right here just pissed me off
immensely and it's just like it's one of
those things where somebody is just so
ignorant to the fact that they don't
 get it and this is why your
 kids are at 14 and
having a making you a
grandmother by the age of 16 your dumb
bitch so hold on okay what a bitch aware
the same bitches here she go so she
plays telling my kid can be president at
eight is so different than
telling my son is dressed as a sea
knows okay do you have kids if you teach
yours the way you do more power but more
power but that and a year older
here to learn to learn read write
correctly and still living under my
 roof I am for my child
expressing themselves but I just learned
how to but you just learn how to spell
correctly why and that's not what we
accept this problem is people stop being
parents are trying to be friends so I
play will you ever cute with gay are
different no so just because you feel
that is wrong doesn't mean that others
do what everything right in the 8 years
old is very organic to them and simply
they just want to do something that's
different out the box because you're
uncomfortable whether you're going to
tell them no because you don't like it
possibly however most of us have had
very same treatment and felt slighted
and left out as kids and I get your
point but it's not about being a friend
but letting your actions as a parent be
true stop telling your kids to be
themselves and as soon as they do
something that you don't like you tell
them to stop now that's right from
 wrong she gonna put man shut
that up making excuses make you and
others look stupid I said see then I
don't know why you mad but it's okay and
maybe one day you'll live in your truth
and our honor will be something that you
can attempt to do because this angry
black bitch is real funny to me so
the reason why I said that is because a
lot of women of color have an issue with
their children especially their sons
being their self when it's not
super duper that is pissing me the
 off and I'm gonna tell you why it's
not at the fact that you feel an issue
with it you mad because of what he'd
going to say was she going to say was
they going to say and how the they
feel that's what I have the
issue and okay this look boy decided he
wanted to be a dragon we okay that's his
 business that's how to
 himself
it's no different from the girl your
daughter wanting to play basketball at
the age of eight the only difference is
you find one to be okay and one not to
be okay I get it
I am NOT a parent but I was a
 child so understand that
what the I'm saying right now holds
a whole bus or a whole bunch away I
compared as a kid to all the other
little boy the with
murderers killer than prison all this
other and yet I am living my life
in my treat and you got a issue
with that
a lot of you mothers would
rather your son's be this or no good
accident girl who's always locked the
 up to him be a drag when you want
to know why because being doing drag is
a negative connotation the funny thing
about it is drag it female impersonation
so that's exactly what a little boy is
doing it's no different from your
daughter wanting to be a princess or
your daughter wanting to
be the president the order different did
you find an issue with one neither one
hurts somebody but you gotta kiss you
with it because you got
insecurities as a parent it's so many
parents I don't even about their
kids and today lay out dead you kick
your kids out of 18 years old because
you feel like oh when you weren't enough
the law says the people in law said your
 six here like the start of
a charge as a adult that's
when you have an issue with the law but
when it's time for them to get about
your hair because 18 years with two
 long from you to be a
responsible parents because you
laid down and had a child
you got an issue you bitches need to
stop having kids that you don't
want to be responsible for for them and
let them be individuals your
mother is up you're raising a
whole bunch of sheep that's the problem
with the world it's a whole bunch of
 sheep nobody knows how to be a
 individual anymore and then you
get mad when your child acts like that
bitch
well why you can't be more like her why
you can't be more like him because yo
dusty-ass I've been working at Saint
tired-ass job for the last 25
years told her all she was good for with
her body so laying the
 down is all she's good for unless
she bought here and get a 9 a
 five because you know why
you as a parent have not instilled in
her that she's more than a
raggedy-ass city job that's why you
failed it the parent you are the
 problem
you are the issue everybody wants to
blame the war and for why something you
have the
or the problem because you sit and you
tell your child be yourself do what you
do and as soon as that person is a
little too often with the you find
to be responsible and acceptable you'll
tell them not to do it so up
your daughter decides mom and said that
I can't go out and try to be a
choreographer because that is we don't
we don't do that in our family I should
go to the post office and get a job
because I got secured money and you know
what that secure money is going to do to
you when you turn 20 five
and you get your Bible being there for
about a good 20 years you got a few
little pension you got a little bit of a
 retirement and that's about
 it you're going to be a paper
pusher for the rest of your life
and you will be dreaming every time you
get on Instagram every time you do
something you're gonna be wishing you
did with the you really wanted to
do but your raggedy-ass mama
you're no good at daddy told you
what the you shouldn't do hey yo
act listened I'm not tellin nobody to
not listen to their parents but what
i'ma tell you the under being an adult
is not based on age because at a very
 young age I had to be a
adult and be responsible for somebody
else that was in myself
okay so I have a lot more sense than a
lot of these parents out here
their mother and not using a
condom does not make you a mother
 parent and it definitely doesn't
make you an authority to tell the person
what they should and they shouldn't do
when it comes down to being themself you
stifle your kids and they go in the
world and they try to figure out who the
 they are from strangers
and you wonder why now my child is
confused about their gender because they
don't understand what it is to simply be
themselves their assumption and they're
trying to find the they are in the
eyes of a whole bunch of
strangers they have no didn't
adjust for them not and the ones who
actually have people who give a
about them you should be blessed because
I have a lot of people and all of the
 life who are there for me who
let me just simply be me no matter what
it was they let me be my self so
I don't have issues with parents being
parental figure so don't take
video wrong but I have the issue
and the black community when you
have a issue with your child
being their self that pip is
made to off
stop trying to cope dude we all have our
own life for a reason okay and
if you you don't want your child to be
hurt by the world
I understand that but what you have to
do and you have to raise that person you
have to raise that child to be strong I
always say people like myself we are the
chosen ones and I'm the reason why I
feel like I'm not like everybody else
because everybody else can handle my
 life the that is said
to me every the things
I've been done to me you have the
to live a very normal life with double
in the corner every day so I
would not be able to be in this position
and still like this if I hadn't been to
anything but it's really sad when I see
bitches who don't give a about they
kids they never around you give
them money that your daughter is out
there telling me look like a nut
on a school night
laid up with your neighbor's son and you
hear that whooshing pregnant at 16 what
the you think they were playing
dominoes but again this is what happens
when you have babies raising
baby so what you should do if you do I
chose I system I did not
want to be like my mother
I did not want to be like that I did not
want to be like my daddy I did not want
to be like my uncle and I didn't want to
be like my bread pears there are great
people but they work regular
jobs all they like and they told
me about the dream they had and what
they never reached I don't want to be
that person so your child has an
interest in something that you may not
do everybody your life
telling you ain't wrong when the do
we start stop letting who
ain't got tell us what the we
should do before this bitch had a
 15 room mansion and the
Palisades busy Ligon Oh
so bitch I'm Beverly Hills okay and
crushed all the Rodale I am the parent
of that child and you ain't the
 parent of me so don't tell
me how to raise my kids
okay so it's not about trying to be your
 kids for him it's about
trying to be their biggest
supreme I'm not sorry first bully was my
momma so forever before I knew a
bullying was I mean that wasn't
 right well black people
don't do this so I see one able to vote
at some point even but just do exercise
everybody right when you need that
Obamacare bitch she was just a checking
and happy right so let's let that be
that if she want to be a
ballerina tried to help her try to push
her in the right direction
stop trying to deter her because she
don't want to be a cheerleader if you
don't want to play football us
all but a bouncing ball and he
want to be an artist
we're being artists why is that oh I get
it because as a parent being a baller
mom you'll get all the perks right
but being Mozart's mama no and the
cheerleader mama you can go ahead and
I'll be cute and go to all the games and
see all other days but at a recital you
can't scream and be ignorant and get
allowed to let them know that show bang
right is that what you're saying so look
at our shoe again it's not about the
kids isn't our shoes or because I'm
gonna tell you something we don't love
the momma don't even support you
in something that ain't hurting nobody
and it gives us just it helps you get to
life and she can't support you why the
 would you think that the world
would give a about you so you know
what kids do they go in a fight a search
and they seek solace from
who don't have nothing but bad integers
for them and then when the kids get
hooked on drugs the trafficking of kids
you have an issue you're on the
news crime I feel the same way when I'm
in IKEA remember whatever
 out that see yesterday and the
 lube world was over now
about with a backs left elbow

I would have been wrong he don't know
what kind of day look happy
I don't know but your parents are
sitting white there when
that age I would know not to give my
 ass up and stand up in a
restaurant or the chair let alone
lean over to the next
table and have the nerve when I look
down you're like hey how you doing how
this thing bitch you see what I'm saying
no I should have simply been a
 just didn't care
I will back flop a child and an old
bitch cuz I don't give a and then
what I want to be just for smacking a
toddler but at the same time the toddler
would have its Max had appearance shut
his ass to sit the down so I think
people have a very big issue with
individuality today if I ask the
 to call me princess
interest I don't want to hear about why
the you don't want to do that don't
address me at all then bitch so I'm on
Facebook some big sets I don't know what
the I am in the color bitch some girl
with a terrible ask icon and a
hands word because all her
Instagram pictures all of the mother but
all her videos look like
surveillance footage she had the nerve
to say something and she said and so
many words well I said I don't want to
be categorized as somebody that I'm not
she says him what are you then I said a
 healing my name is vegan
nice to meet you all she's just so busy
the labels is what kills me yes I am gay
that is the label yes I am a male that
is a label but because I choose to wear
women's clothes sometimes doesn't mean
that I want to be a woman it's no
different than a girl saying this really
I'm going to the men's department and
hmm I like the way it is the cut of
these shirts are and she wear heels in a
purse with it she's not trying to do if
she wears a frame with the that's
just who she is
let just simply be then
why is it that we are in 2017 and nobody
could be themselves because everybody
has an issue with somebody being
themselves where are we now I know
people have had issues because when I
did that Kim Burrell video well why are
you mad at her being a Christian that's
how Christians thing because her
heavy
ass is a walking contradiction you can't
tell me or her or him are they what the
 they doing wrong bitching your
 gluttonous ass is sitting
here having a nerve to preach to
somebody that is not what you do and on
top of that as a Christian your job is
to spread love not negativity okay
period so if it's going to come up wrong
and it's going to hurt somebody that is
considered negative period and as a
pastor and your church that's not what
the you're doing you dumb bitch
so all of you guys who are trying to
make people wrong right it's like me
saying and it's in no way shape or form
the same thing but if your child is
molested by a pedophile and you asked
why did you do this to my child and I'm
still waiting for pedophiles what he
does it doesn't make it right
so stop trying to compare apples to
oranges because it does it doesn't make
any sense just because somebody does
something does not make it okay just
because they say well she is allowed to
be as bigoted because she's a
Christian that doesn't work just like
I'm not allowed to be disrespectful and
club or run up and down the street and
call people bitches and hoes and Tramp
because that's how the I feel
about them so stop getting on social
media stop writing these longest
paragraphs about what other
 should do with their kids
period most of your bitches don't even
know you're here
your daughters is
and sucking a whole block bitch
because you so baby up under your nigga
you don't even know that so i'ma leave
it there because this video is
incredible but that I just had to
do because I'm really tired of so-called
pairs trying to parent and then telling
somebody where you're not a parent and
you don't know where we've all been kids
bitch and I know what a no-good ass
parent is and I see them often on social
media just one one one thing farther
low girl decided she wanted to get up in
my comments and be grown so I'll back
slap that bitch with this verbal
 situation cuz she when I
ever grown-ass Smackdown then I'm grown
ass momma decide she why are you talking
to my child like that because the little
bitch deserved it
wanted to be wrong there she goes and
I'm bitching she won't stick on her
 chest to nobody else I can
guarantee that well why are you talking
to a child like that cached in her
 place that's why don't
talk to me like an adult bitch because
I'm gonna treat you like one and wrong
bitches get that work all the time I
can't put my hands physically on you but
this verbal ass what I must to get you
little bitch you go no show again check
your kids before you get on the internet
trying to check somebody else because
when all is said and done most of the
time they look for the drama when I see
little kids going at it one of them that
started it when I look on a shade room
and somebody talked about something
here you go little Christina want to
give her opinion about a relationship
Misha still got your
starter TVs but you still spotty blood I
wouldn't give a about what the
you feel so just to let you know you
ain't on my level
I'm a lightshow asset so you can
understand you ain't on my level
okay so again closing out let people do
what the they want to do if I work
what's that you call me
nice and mr. doggy em I
want to be doggie dogs every
 and I don't want to hear
about who don't like it if I see a bitch
tomorrow she said I want to be known as
much miss emperess enchantress what's up
bitch shut up ee what you're doing bitch
like I don't hear that has nothing to do
with me
i'ma respect your wishes because quite
frankly you calling yourself something
that I don't agree with and I should you
do it tea in China it ain't something my
mother pockets whatsoever so I'm
a goal for this video is too long
already but I'll catch y'all to my next
one peace and learn let's show
 kids to be themselves
welfare as if they wrong okay but let
them just be there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
