your dear parents and the reason why I
want to do this topic is because I get
an abundance of letters from younger
kids who just don't understand you know
the the parenting that's going on in
their household and and I'm gonna hit on
a lot of topics that I feel are
necessary because not that long ago I
was a kid as you get older sometimes you
distance yourself from your parents at
times you get closer it depends on the
dynamic and the type of family that you
come from the thing that I see the most
in the issue that I hate the most is
when I see parents who just owned their
children for things that their children
have no control over and I know how it
feels to be neglected and ignored and
treated different because of who you are
and I think a lot of times parents and
sometimes unknowingly sometimes it's
malicious and you know calculated words
what you do to your kids I think you
don't really get that so let me take you
back to the point where you found out
you were pregnant right and some of you
guys may have been scared some of you
guys may have been contemplating
abortion but for whatever reason you
decided I don't want to do that I want
to be a parent I want to be responsible
for my actions and I'm going to have my
child and I commend every woman and
every dude who stuck by every woman
who's this is an accident brother was
planned you guys were being negligent
whatever you know having a child is a
blessing it's not something that I think
people should take lightly because
everybody can have kids you know so when
you do have them in you're blessed with
the ability to have them you have to
cherish them and you're now responsible
for a new life and sometimes people
forget that some some of these young
ladies and young men have babies when
they're babies so there's there's no
handbook to be a parent and I'm very
aware of that
there is no handbook to be a parent
because every child is different every
spirit is different and everything that
you do is different and you try your
best as a parent to do whatever you can
in order to make sure that your kids are
good the issue and the problem that I
have is today at today's day and age it
seems like parents because of the
internet and everything that's going on
they pay less and less attention to
their children I've seen little girls
of youngest sixth working in pampers
I've seen mothers screaming and yelling
at their daughters about being hosed on
camera and I'm not saying that you're
right or you're wrong in the way that
you decide to parent because everybody
is different but my whole thing is this
what example have you put forth for your
children to want to be better have you
been the best example possible are you
the person that they can look to to want
to be great in life have you sacrificed
all that you could in order for your
children to have better lives or have
you just pretty much coasted have you
pretty much tried to find any excuse as
to why you want them out of your life
how you wanting to just put them on
everybody else how you just didn't feel
like dealing with them me and all of us
here none of us acts to be here you
didn't poke your head out your mom's
vajayjay and say hey y'all on September
whatever whatever I want to be here
because I want to be on earth and I want
to be your baby that's not how we're
life works when your children do not end
up being what you want them to be and
who you want them to be you tend to just
say okay I don't I don't want to mess
with you no more like you got a yes a
wrap you got a go
how can you disown the very person that
you brought into this world your
everything the one thing that's for some
of you guys helped and made you want to
live why would you disown them because
they happen to be gay or they happen to
be a lesbian or they happen to be
different why is because your son is an
african-american lucky man he wants to
go study neuroscience and you feel like
the only way that he only thing that he
would be good in the only way out of the
hood is for him to play basketball and
he does not want to do that so you would
rather take the money that he could have
for these classes to take some extra
curricular things after school you would
rather take that money and buy him a new
pair of Jordans if your child does not
want to play basketball why the is
you buying him Jordans every
 month why is that
but then he asks you mom I want a
chemistry set so I can try to learn
another house
no no no but you got money that
anyway but you find every month you got
that Jordan money that shows that you
don't care you don't care cuz you want
them to be who you want them to be
you're you're basically telling them
what you like don't matter but what I
like that's the only thing that matters
because I'm the one in here work and I'm
the one that's that's putting in work
I'm the one that's going to work and
putting money into the house it doesn't
always work like that and that's what
you guys got to understand it's not
always about you and unfortunately it's
the truth
when you become a parent and you make
that decision that you want to have a
child
your whole individuality is gone it's
you and baby now it's not about you know
more boo because as soon as you shove
that little baby I should little bitch
AJ it became about y'all okay ours okay
our baby and I never want my children to
be like me I want them to be better than
me but I'm gonna set an example so they
can have something to look up to a lot
of you women out here whether you're a
stripper you're a prostitute
you work at Arby's you work at Denny's
whatever the situation is as long as
you're doing it in order to better your
child's life and not hinder them and
you're not taking that money that you're
working so hard for it about new pair of
Louboutins meanwhile your damn child is
walking out here dirty with a sucker
stuck today tutor today old diaper and a
smell like but what kind of example
are you setting what kind of mother are
you
and for the fathers all that you dudes
out here want to sit up here and
complain about your baby mamas and this
is that mrs. F and she had hope and she
did and she did and she I'm sure she was
all those things when you laid up and
you ran up in her ass - I'm sure she
would and you ladies are the same thing
when you guys have kids by these no-good
dudes who you knew for a fact that he
jumped out at the pan he didn't have
nothing and because you was crushing on
him we always up in high school and now
y'all up in y'all 30s and he ain't got
nothin to show for life you still let
him run a thing you do everything he
wanted to do with you and now your left
foot baby and now he's no good and your
daddy ain't well let me tell you
something
he wasn't when you got with him but
you still laid with him he was crude in
he was good enough for you then
and then when it would kills me is when
y'all turn around talking about them
you late just like your mother
invading bitch or not forget us he's
supposed to look like rather their daddy
ain't or whatever the situation is
your point as a mother or even as a
father is not to beat down the person
that you want Slade with regardless of
what they do if you have a bone to pick
with the father of your child then you
pick that bone but don't have that child
against their their their their father
or their mother because they're going to
grow up and have a complex against that
sex that's why a lot of men don't
respect the women because of how their
fathers spoke to their mothers or how
their mother's boyfriends spoke to their
mothers or how they've never had a
mother you know it's look at Stevie J he
don't even have a relationship with his
mom and you can tell so it's it's you as
the parent it starts at home and it is
such a true statement it starts at home
when I decide that I want to have
children you best believe I don't want
my children to be anything like me I
want them to leave better and when I say
that I mean no matter what they decide
and who they want to be or who they feel
in the inside I'm going to support them
a hundred and fifty percent and I've
seen it cuz I have friends who do this
their kids will come to them and say mom
I want to do cheerleading or I want to
go out and look go for the softball team
or I want to go for the hockey team but
because your son is an african-american
male happens to be what six five in the
10th grade
the first thing you want to do is go buy
him a pair of Jordans and put them on a
court because you feel like that's your
way out of the hood for him to go and
dribble a ball and you guys have got to
remember life is more than just that
because every child is not going to be
the next Shaq every dude is not going to
be the next Kobe every woman is not
every girl who can sing or is not going
to be the next beyoncé those people are
special and I'm not saying that your
kids are not special I'm saying that
that is for them and I'm not saying that
it can never happen for them but you got
to allow
them to do it they want to do when it
comes to their lives with you guys as
parents need to realize is that if you
do not support your kids your babies the
ones you brought in the world the one
that you spent what 72 hours pushing out
if you do not support them they're going
to find support for someone else and
sometimes it's in the arms of a nasty
man who has no just no respect for kids
they're gonna go they're gonna run away
they're gonna do all these things
because their mother their father their
grandmother their aunt
they're all these people that are your
family sometimes your family are the
worst critics for you and they run away
they don't want to do with you guys
because you don't allow them to be who
they are your kids are not going to be
like you they're not going to be like
you but I'm tell you one thing they will
want to do and every child wants this is
a one acceptance from their parents they
want their parents to say I am proud of
who you are who you become and what you
are doing regardless of what that
whatever that is they want back and when
you stop doing that when you stop
showing that because everything that
comes out of your mouth is a damn
complaint they feel neglected they feel
unwanted and what do you say you just
being melodramatic you be an extra you
being is you being that you set the tone
for how your kids will be in life and
the kids you kids you don't always have
to be with your parents want you to be
and you don't always have to be exactly
like your parents at the end of the day
you are who you are and at the end of
the day you make the decision about what
your future will be now if your mother
was never taught how to be a proper
adult then you got to take it on the
chin to understand and when you becoming
in Sedona and understand listen she had
the proper tools to do so you know I'm
saying I'm feeling very wisdom eyes
today because it is great hair so bear
with me but if she didn't have the
problem person to tell her how to be a
parent get on the hell she supposed to
be a parent to you but that doesn't mean
anything because I went through that
very same thing I can come on here and
preach about everything because you know
what I took the initiative to not let
things and people in my past who were
supposed to be for their for me who was
supposed to show me the
in the wrong way to do this is that any
other and use that as a crutch as to why
I'm not doing this and oh my because my
mother was this I don't want to go
through life and do this so I'm scared
to do this or I'm not gonna do this
because my my it ain't got to do
with nothin they ain't got to do it
- you're tryna honey
you went to get off your ass and stop
being lazy and you parents I'm here
stop not allowing your kids to grow just
because you come from Compton that
doesn't mean that you cannot be a
scientist you cannot go out here and
study the ology of whatever you know I'm
saying like all these things are
tangible if you allow them to be you
have to learn how to motivate your
children to do more than dribble a ball
hell you have got to understand to be a
parent has no right or wrong
just try to be the best person that you
can be for your children because the
children are our future if they
up and the way the world is gonna right
now oh whoa it's gonna be a problem so
if your children just come to you one
day they happen to be gay it's not gonna
be a surprise to you because at some
point as a parent you knew you just mask
it you act like you didn't hear it you
act like you didn't know about it you
act like you didn't care about it so now
that they're telling you all the sudden
you will you want to act like it didn't
happen it you don't want to talk about
it okay that's great that's a grand and
that shows that you are a nice beautiful
parent because you're just neglected the
very person that you brought into this
world how can you deny the person that
you brought into the world I don't get
that like what kind of sisters that make
if anybody should be their biggest
cheerleader it should be you when the
so-called family wants to question your
child's being and what they doing and
how they making the family look you
should be the very person up there
telling them to kiss both of y'all asses
and if you can't with my child
and you can accept my child for who the
 they are then you don't have to
talk to neither one of us because the
only reason why we're family is because
we have the same bloodline the respect
level that family should have is not
their bitch so let me tell you something
you can't accept my baby for who the
 they are you can go and you can
take you and your judgments will ask
friends which you dirty
so let it be what it is you have to
learn to support your kids and whatever
the they do except for them being a
murder they want to be a crackhead or
all that other stuff but if they have
dreams and aspirations that don't fit
the situation that you are currently in
try your damnedest in your heart is to
try to get them to where you feel they
should be in like the problem with kids
today they got no passion for they
come out here they are putting they ass
titties vaginas everything you can think
of on the Internet
they have too much idle time that's
really what it is just I know so many
girls on on Instagram who have X amount
of followers because they're ignorant
because they're pretty
they don't say anything worthwhile but
that's that's that's the new goal today
is to be famous or to be known for that
meanwhile you have other little girls
out here who are working and grinding to
get their degrees to do things that they
have to do there they're busting tables
in order to be waitresses and things of
that nature because they want better
things for their stuff in life they want
to do better but chances are nine times
out of ten they've come from a home
where that was the example you have to
work and that's there should be
everybody's life lesson for your
children but as soon as your kids do
something that you don't like you can't
turn your back on them and tell them
that they're not and they're never
gonna amount to nothing
and you're this and you can never come
because you can't be gay in my
 house cuz that bitch ain't
nobody worried about that roach-infested
 house like that bitch cuz
Yoshi and ain't no better than the next
bitch so what you should be trying
to do is motivate your child to let them
know that I'm here for you no matter
what so when somebody comes and talks
ignorant about your daughter because she
wants to dribble a ball or your son
because he wants to be a
scientist or maybe he wants to go to be
a mechanic or he want to do something
that it's so left field to what you feel
or your friends feel or the hood feel
they should be then you should be their
number-one cheerleader and not turning
on and telling them that yeah they right
you know you shouldn't be that just
because people become adults
that doesn't mean they always have minds
of their own a lot of adults still
follow their friends a lot of adults
still want to fit in a lot of adults
have never become adults
just because you become 18 years old or
21 you can roll a blunt and go buy some
Ciroc
and some Everclear that does not mean
that you are now an adult because your
mindset is still that of a child you are
still in high school you are still
trying to fit in while you have these
young kids looking at you and ladies
just because you may be a stripper you
may be you may be a woman in a fortune
500 company there's not a little girl in
this world who does not look up to her
mother and want to be just like her your
kids are going to be exactly who they
are whether you agree with it or not the
only difference is you're going to make
the road for them much harder by not
supporting them that's it it's not about
religious beliefs because the Bible says
and the Bible says that I'm sure you had
your child out of wedlock and and I'm
not talking about all parents cuz all
parents are not like this and I salute
the man out here who are out here taking
care of their children I salute the
women out here who are out here taking
care of their kids and they're bussing
tables are they sliding down that pole
to make sure that they kids got
somewhere to sleep at night ok I don't
judge people and how they get they money
because I'm not putting no money in your
pocket I'm not feeding your kids when
your kids are hungry
I'm not buying them Huggies and
unbinding pampers so therefore I can't
tell you what is wrong and it's right
but as long as you're doing whatever you
can do and your power should be a
 parent whether you rather
you only making $10 an hour whether you
only making $1 an hour as long as you
take in and you split net and you making
sure your kids are good that is what
being a parent is but you have to be
able to be an example in order for your
kids to follow it that's the thing if
you're not doing anything worthwhile
you're doing the same thing and you're
smoking blunts and you're drinking with
your kids because you think it's cute
because you had her when you was 13 and
you think because yarnell equals that
doesn't work because she's never gonna
grow up and respect anything that you do
she's gonna always see you as a peer
she's gonna fight you she's gonna cuss
you out
she's gonna whoop your ass you gonna be
every bitch in the book because there's
no authority there she looks at you as a
friend and you don't always want to be
your friends you want to be somebody
bigger and better so ladies be an
example for your children fellas be an
example for your sons and your daughters
and understand a man is not measured for
how long his penis is how low his pants
sag how hard he can be his chest a man
is measured in his pride and
man is measured in what the he can
do for his family a man is measured in
who he can go to out in the world
and be regardless of who ever has
anything to say so before you start
talking about an example of a man if
your son wants to play with dolls and
you can see no other thing that's who
the he's going to be whether you
accept it or not the only difference
between that and this is that he's going
to go out and he's going to look for
that support from somebody else she's
gonna look at the support for somebody
else and it can be the arms of a very
tragic situation in a very tragic man
it's gonna leave your baby the one that
you brought into this world your pride
and joy that you turned your back on
because you didn't agree with who the
 they were just be the perfect you
and make sure your kids feel comfortable
enough to be the perfect them and life
will be much better we need to learn how
to mine our own business
and worry about what's going on at home
versus worth going on into belongs and
what's going on at other people's houses
worry about your goddamn self and the
world would be a much better place and
on that note I will talk to you guys
later
