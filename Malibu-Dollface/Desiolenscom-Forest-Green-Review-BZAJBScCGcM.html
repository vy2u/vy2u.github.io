contact lenses that I have been rocking
for a probably about a month now you
don't have any of the packaging anymore
I still own it I just don't know where
it said these are from I'll just use
this these are from Desio lenses calm I
think is SEO lenses calm or that's your
eyes calm I'm not sure but we should see
that up above uh before we get started
you I paid my own money for these
contacts
I was not contacted by the company I
have no relation with them whatsoever
this is my honest opinion as always this
is just my opinion personally of these
contacts how I like them the life of
them how they feel the comfort are we
gonna go through all that so I have been
seeing a lot of people so one particular
makeup artist that I follow on Instagram
I think his name is the vanity Ariel if
I'm not mistaken I'll put him right here
he has a lot of beautiful makeup and
I've noted I'd noticed in his video I
mean in a lot of some his videos and his
photos his eyes were a lot of different
colors but they all look natural none of
them looked like that fresh look contact
look I hate this back in the day I used
to wear a lot of contacts from downtown
LA you go down there's a pair for $10 on
a rainy day you can get two pairs for
$10 just saying so when I was in high
school I used to wear like um like a
brownish color it was like a honey brown
color and then I had grey at a point I
think I missed her wool and I had great
contacts and then I had green I have
every color at a particular colors like
amethyst aka purple I never had colors
like that I just thought because they're
natural so when I seen these on his
Instagram page I was like you know what
I want to check them out and see like
what their contacts really are about
because I keep on here and a lot about
their company that they have really good
natural contacts and their contacts are
tailored for people with darker eyes so
I have natural brown eyes they're not
dark brown they're like a off brown in
the sunlight or in like light like this
they tend to look a little bit
lighter than they really are or maybe
that's a true color I don't know but
usually that's the color that I use the
I'm rocking right now are the fourth
green they have I think like I think
this one is wedged in between two souls
forth green it's a lot of green and the
thing that's a darker green if I'm not
mistaken don't quote me so I picked this
color because I looked on YouTube of
course for reviews and the young lady
that I had watched I don't remember her
name or anything but I know she was a
little bit on the more brown complexion
than I am and they looked like beautiful
on her so I'm like okay they look great
on her
the chances are then they're gonna look
very exotic on me because they look very
natural on her um so I was like whoa
they look great on her so I'm gonna see
how they look on my complexion because
sometimes if the color is too stark it
makes me look like I'm albino or you
know how vinyls have like very like very
porcelain sometimes see through eyes I
didn't want that look I was like I
wanted to look like my neck my eyes
could be naturally green because green
is the color that's usually very neutral
I didn't want a brown I didn't want a
grey broken I just wanted something very
very natural so I got these for I think
US dollars I think there were 60 bucks
if I'm not mistaken which is not bad
okay I just wanted to show you guys what
it looks like this is no contact this is
with the contact so it's a big
difference
okay it's a huge difference my I tend to
go more like this with the color versus
this one in my opinion I don't know if
I'm just seeing stuff well I'm seeing
what I want to see but yeah it's not
like a company car like silica lenses or
something like that I was like Renee
from UM and they're like a hundred
dollars so this was actually very
inexpensive for what is the you know the
competitor out there they come from I
think Australia if I'm not mistaken so
when you order them they tell you that
they're gonna take two to four weeks to
come mine came within a week I ordered
on Monday and I received them one on
Monday and I'm in the u.s. I'm in
California I'm in LA okay so that's the
good thing about it they don't make you
they give you like the longest possible
waiting time and then they come the next
week when I receive them they came with
the box that he came in and had an
instruction manual on how to take care
of them it came with this case that has
just you on this side and then it says
it has the art for the right eye and you
know as long as I don't wear contacts I
never put them in the leg this is my
right side this is my I just thought
back up in here and then and whenever
one don't feel right I just take it out
and switch it I don't know if you
supposed to do that because I'm not a
contact where and I don't wear glasses
or anything cuz I got that 20/20 vision
so I can see all the beers but it came
with that it came with instruction menu
when it came in a box that said that
seolin's isn't and at the bottom it said
force green on the you know the color
that I was that I received which was the
correct colors tell me where I've
complained that they got the wrong color
but okay
they came in to two separate things
where you pulled the aluminum off and
then you put them in
I brought some renews it refresh contact
solution at Target and I use those I
usually dump my every time I wear these
I dump the old solution out and I put a
new solution in I find that that keeps
the contacts as fresh as possible and
because I don't wear these every single
day I tend to wear them a lot either
when I'm going out and I dress up or I'm
doing a video but I don't really wear
them just lounge around a house however
I did wear them for eight hours one time
and I will have to say these have been
the most comfortable contact lenses I've
ever used in my life because usually
after a certain amount of hours contact
seem to make me sleepy and I forgot that
I had a minute till I having to look in
the mirror because my face was looking
real greasy and I needed to put on some
powder and I was like oh I forgot I had
contacts in and everybody who sees them
in person
Oh your eyes are beautiful and they
don't look like those really ones with
that pixelated look I hate that and you
can tell somebody especially when people
have big eyes and they put in context or
they get the wrong color that don't
complement their skin tone like if I
stand this far back you were just I
don't know about you but I was just
assumed if I see myself like oh his eyes
are pretty and I will go about my day I
wouldn't really be like hmm there's
something really off about that now when
you get really close if I do that if you
get really close like such it kind of
blends itself out into the natural eye
so the around it you can still see my
natural brow
which blends with the actual green they
said that there are to be used for three
months in the nurse they should be
thrown away after three months I've had
them for about a month and a half now so
I'm gonna order another pair I want to
order another pair of these and I want
to order like a different color but I
don't know what color I want to order I
kind of leaning towards the gray color
but broken really likes grey she gets
them fresh looking and she just like all
into the grays and I don't really wanna
be looking like her you know not like
that but I don't want to be like oh girl
we got the same color
no so I don't really know I think I'll
probably get they have one call like I
think innocent white and it's like a
cream color think so it's something like
that I don't know
i'ma just try something a little bit
different and see how I like it you know
but so far so good I haven't had any
discomfort with these I keep them in a
case I used our fresh solution they
don't feel like I have anything in and
I'm the one that gets very sensitive my
eyes get red real easily am i dead by
the Visine for contacts just in case I
ever got a little discomfort because
there was one time where I was wearing
them and I think this one started to
feel like a little uncomfortable and I
popped them good old eyedrops in and I
was good I was like okay we didn't got
another little couple hours left in this
lo puppy so yeah I like these and so if
you guys are wondering if you should
order from desi Oh to me personally I
would order for them they do have an
option to send in if you have a
prescription you can get them put it
your prescription put in a pair i
believe it cost more I'm certain it cost
more but if you are the person who wears
contacts on a regular basis then fine
these are not meant to be worn over I
think eight hours I think after eight
hours they're best if you take them out
again I wore them for eight hours and I
didn't experience any discomfort but
that was one time I have not done it
since then so yeah that was my review on
this year I'll see what my next ones
bring but as far as my forest green ones
I really do like these they they've done
a good job cuz usually I was very
against contacts for a long time after
my downtown LA contact Fiasco that I
have where they were just not
comfortable and they didn't look natural
it just looked like I was just like I
won't blue eyes so I'm gonna brought me
up here yeah I'll be back and let you
guys know how these are at the end and
then I'll come back with a new color and
another color of these so yeah
I'll talk to you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
