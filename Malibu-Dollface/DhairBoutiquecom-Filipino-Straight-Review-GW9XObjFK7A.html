by saying I really don't know the specs
of my hair right now I really don't and
I didn't realize that in said right now
when I get ready to do the review for it
cuz I'm so freaking in love and I just
had like a Destiny's Child moment
survivor y'all just is that album but
anyway just her that I'm rocking right
now is from D Hair Boutique and you guys
know that I work with them I think last
year
nothing was last year when I had like
the similar style but I had uh but the
Jessica Rabbit up here like it was just
it was very voluminous okay um and I
love that hair and I actually gave the
hair to my sister because she was like
but to slap me in the mouth for that
hair I didn't realize into right now
that I did not know the specs of my hair
but I think one of the girls who works
for the company actually put it in my
comments on Instagram I believe now the
title upstairs may say something
different but I believe this is their
Filipino hair what happened was when I
was are contacted about the review I was
told that they had a new texture and
they had named a jet and I've had his
hair for a little while so I didn't I
had been wearing the hair but when I did
it and I colored it I don't know if you
could tell but up enough front and so
let just a smidgen of a colors like a
little chocolate when I did I was like
this is some really nice hair but I
didn't think what kind of heritage but I
said it is giving me kind of a Filipino
vibe Filipino or Peruvian vibe is what
is giving me okay so let me tell you
look look listen
so okay you guys know I do a lot of hair
reviews and I deal with a lot of virgin
hair and some not virgin hair um on a
regular basis and usually when I do my
wigs I told you guys I always say this I
don't vaccinate opps because usually the
wefts are double tied so that means
they're a little bit thicker when you
get to the top and you don't want this
part to be bulky you want it to lay like
this very smooth and flat right okay so
my closure you
I know is from closure story this is the
Russian straight this is yeah this is
the Russian straight still based closure
okay
now usually when I get to the top I have
to lit the tracks and put them around to
close up my closure
these tracks I don't know with these
girls where they get their hair from
what a vendor is to keep them good y'all
doing a good job okay these are the
flattest West when I say flat tips about
every said this in the past so I take
that back the flat tips that I have ever
had ever
okay when I tell you ever usually when
you're trying to put a lot of hair in
and make it fool you're gonna get some
bulk um at the top because you're trying
to put so much hair and you gotta cut
web so you gotta split tracks none of
that with this this was completely fine
this is what all my bundles and my
closure came in they sent me a closure
but it was a lace closure and you guys
know I'm not likely closer than oh
however his hair made up for all of that
this my dear is how thin the weft is
there are two no it's what they're just
single tie so that's why these are
single tight so that's why they are so
flat usually when you get up if you ever
look at your bundles when you get them
it's usually two of these tied together
in order to make the bundle look fuller
but they just did one which man oh man
it makes a world of a difference when
you're doing your hair because you don't
want the top of your weed to look all
big and bulky um this was the closure
that they sent I'm like I told you guys
it was a lace closure I'm not a big fan
of lace by a long shot so this is what
it looked like so the lengths that I
have in I have not however I'm going to
guesstimate right now when I put them in
I believe this is curled and I believe
that my longest one is a 24 leave that I
have in a 20 or 24 of 22 of 20 and an 18
that's what I believe I have him because
the 18 came a little bit past my closure
and my closure is 16 inches so I would
have guessed to make that's what it is
plus it's curl and I cut it so yeah
that those are the bundles that I'm
walking I have four of them so it should
be a you know 24 of 22 or 20 and and 18
so those are the four bundles that I
have and I colored the hair and it took
to the color very well as you can see
right here there is much lighter than
the rest of the hair but I didn't want
it to be like blonde I didn't want that
I'm British look I wanted something very
sleek very nice very pretty um and just
a little bit of Papa coal I just a
smidgen and I am I thought what I wanted
I've been having this wig done and
rocking it for a look like about two
weeks to half week something like that
it's somewhere in there um but I know
that when I first did this and I curled
it it looked like it was very like big
like all this was very which I loved and
then after I had uh washed it and
deconditioned it and then redid it it
did the same thing but these curls that
I got any day like five six days old so
you know the good thing about curling
your hair is that and you when you wear
wigs is that when you take them off and
you curl them you can throw them
somewhere or put them on a mannequin
head and then when you grip you get
ready to wear them again the curls that
you had left in it now are waves and
it's a new hairstyle so yeah I there's
not many
I don't really get excited like I told
y'all before about hair like that
because I have so much of it I do with
so much but this was so much fun to wear
and this has been so easy to wear
literally minimal to no shedding
literally minimal to no shedding and I
think that has a lot to do with the fact
that they are single tie and there are
double tie when I did after I washed it
the first time it didn't give me no
problems they didn't shed much it shed
it a little bit um when I when it was
wet but as it's been dry I haven't
really experienced any major flaws or
issues I love it this is the Filipino
from dear boutique this is I believe in
a 24 22 or 20 and 18 but I could be
wrong it's kind of natural
it's not like you know to bug do belong
young long hair I think I'm gonna do
this hair red I want this to be like a
Lindsay Lohan red I think this would be
a really cute style from like here down
and it's natural like carrot top red
because I like it this color but I think
I'm gonna try something else so I don't
know we don't see we don't see but I'll
come back and do an update for y'all on
this because I'm not going to color
right now so I'll come back with a
update to let you guys know how the
color turned out and all that but I do
like this like this is very simple but
it still gives me Jessica Rabbit still
gives me Barbie it still gives me sexy
so I'll get you guys in the next one
better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
