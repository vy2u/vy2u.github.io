a gang so sexy dumb originated up okay
so this is going to be review for my
hair my nice summer hair I got all my
one-piece my jacket you know I'm selling
my glasses I'm feeling very summer-like
I'm for like like Malibu Barbie like
black Malibu Barbie 2.0 in actual Malibu
so anyway my hair is from diamond
merchant you can't really see it very
well but I see irrigable diamond virgin
here you guys know that my infamous meek
hair I'll put right here for the new
people are here welcome but this was my
straightening hair this is their
Brazilian curly hair and um off the RIP
because I have never had any issues with
them or their hair I can say off the
rent this this is some of the best curly
hair because you guys know I don't do
curly I'm not a big fan of curly hair
because it's a lot of maintenance and
it's a lot for you to have to do and you
know you can't dry it out you can't put
too much product in it because it weighs
it down then it becomes dry but this
hair y'all about that summer life and
the closure that I have in was actually
not sent by the mist was sent from a
different company and y'all I finally
found my damn one so I wanted the
closure because the closure was at the
ends of it I found this closure randomly
when I was um I'm packing all of my hair
and then I found my flat iron my curlers
and my damn one so thank goodness I have
found those things so I was able to one
the top of closure to blend with the
bottom of the hair so the closure this
is the closure this is a closure with
all of this and then this right here
is the actual hair texture so yeah it
blends pretty well so I have in 426 s so
this is how long 26 is on me
um this here has been co-wash Aiko
washed it twice just to you know see get
a feel for it and I put this argan oil
mask on it after I had um Co washed it
because it was nothing wrong with it but
just to keep the hair hydrated because a
lot of times when I know people buy
curly hair they always complain this is
like so number one here they always say
that Matt's on them or not this hair in
particular but just curly hair in
general they say that the hair mats on
them or after about a monkey's head of
hair that the hair with the hell and you
know and what people don't understand
about curly hair is that it's much more
maintenance than it is or straight hair
because in order to keep the the curl
pattern like it is you can't i
personally don't suggest that people
straighten their curly hair because i'm
sure if you straighten your curling or
whatever and then it will go back to its
original state
but most of the time when nine times out
of ten usually the curl is much looser
than what it was when you first
initially did it so i always say you
know we are in the age of religious or
popping and I like this stuff just go
ahead and get you some shrine here and
some curly hair and then wear one and
you know cuz they don't keep it really
will prolong the life of your hair you
know it really will I know everybody
doesn't have extra money like that it's
just we buy in 700 here 700 air base is
an option because and the long run your
hair will definitely do you um justice
because you will not have burnt out the
crow pattern and all that good stuff but
anyway I'm again I have in off for 26 is
and I think my closure is the lace
closure from I don't remember where but
it is um sing for nothing 16 yeah is
about 16 um one thing I did was after I
co wash did I installed it and then
after I installed it I made sure that
the curl pattern that I think is you
know long has different it's small at
the bottom and is wider at the top so
pretty much I just guesstimate it with
the curl pattern here was to try to
match this at the top this what I posed
to do the other day and then remember I
just I was like I had the fun
she's not turning out like I want to but
this turned out exactly like I wanted to
I had minimal shedding it had a little
bit when I was taking the curls I mean
taking the bundles apart initially to
co-wash tomb um one of them tangled on
me just a little bit but I just run my
fingers through it and it was fine
so I think it was because everything was
so wound so tightly because these are
curls that's and I have that problem
a little more often than not when I'm
actually pulling the hair apart because
it's just like this one big spiral curl
type as far as the smell goes it smells
so beautiful when I got it it is smell
like it have been like washed with
anything you know besides where they got
the vendor from because sometimes like I
told you guys I don't like when people
wash the hair like if you get it from
the vendor and it smells like something
and then you wash it it makes me a
little leery but this hair perfect and
it's perfect for the summer because you
can actually get when it's wet it looks
beautiful
after I co washed it I let it air dry I
did not diffuse it or anything I thought
I did it I laid them all you know pants
hangers you know the other way and then
I just let them dry over my shower and
it's the like because when I first
received the hair which was probably
about four weeks ago
I initially did all of this I put it
nicely back into the box that which you
came and then when I installed it the
week after that um it was just like this
it was big and beautiful and puffy and
you know puffy in a good way
another bad way um but yeah you could
put color to this I'm sure I will take
color very beautifully um the ends of
this hair are not dry you know sometimes
you get curly hair to be really dry but
the ends of this hair is like still
they're still very bouncy and springy
like they don't have that dry I don't
know it just think that's why I don't
wear a lot of curly hair because it is
so much maintenance but when you get
some good hair it is so beautiful like
look how beautiful this area look at the
luster and this was just from a collage
with my giovanni's 50/50 conditioner and
then I used a little bit of my argan oil
coconut conditioner
a little bit and I mix them together and
then I put it in the hair and then I put
in a bag and I let it sit for about an
hour then I took it out and then I
rinsed it with our lukewarm water and
then I just let it dry and then I
haven't put any any product in it or
anything like it's been like this since
I've had it so yeah I don't know how
this would like hold up because it is
like the summer I don't know how this
would hold up in like salt water
I really wouldn't put I wouldn't put
much in salt water let alone my weave
but this you could achieve this look
with a shorter shorter bundles as well
this is 26 but if you wanted something
like like 24 or 20 or you just wanting
like a big curly mane like maybe a short
but you want it really curly this would
be the perfect hair to do so it and
again if you can't find a matching
closure ever you can always curl or one
your other closure to match your hair
it's not really a difficult process at
all that's why sometimes when people
like well why does his closure look like
this in mines didn't or it came like
this in him because I did something to
it I just didn't take it out because the
ends of the closure were very springy
like the hair but the roots of it and of
course anybody who hasn't actually
curling here their roots of their hair
tends to be a little bit more on the
straight side because they run their
fingers through it and it's where the
most it grows out of the scalp that way
and they brush it a lot from the root so
it still looks natural though it has
like this very natural um Beach feel to
it so that's why I object to keep the
pink up and I put on my mosquito pink um
I was a pink I put this bathing suit I
were to pride it was on my favorite 21:1
you sharp you probably seen it in the
beginning of the video and then this
jacket is my Barbie mosquito one but on
pride I wear the white one not this one
but anyway as far as the webscoe to
build the West were very they were I
would say out of a ten I would give them
about an eight only because of the
thickness but I understand why you guys
know I just have an obsession with thin
uh long with a thin flat bundle the
upside about that is that you know it is
curly hair and it you need to want to
put a nice amount in order to get this
full look you know you don't want no
thin curly hair you know let me show
them without mother use somebody as an
example but never mind but yeah it was
fine to the hair is big
so you really can't tell I like that
preferably when I'm doing straight here
because I wanted to lay as flat as
possible so I have so much value into it
and you can really get a sense of that
it don't really matter how thick the
bundles are I mean the weft are but it I
mean it's not a deal-breaker for me even
if that was the case and I've seen
somebody else review to say I probably
would have been like I don't really hear
there's gonna be big anyway so yeah the
shedding again only got a little bit
like when I run my fingers through it
like this and it is curly hair so I got
one strand which was this one and I had
a really wet pool is alone but yeah like
one strand and using when you have curly
hair or wavy hair it tends to shed a lot
because of the state is in so you
pulling it you just kind of like pulling
it out of whatever it's either punched
or wound or tied into which is not a
good thing to do I don't never tell you
go girl run your fingers do your curly
hair it's best to kind of run your
fingers like this and pull them apart
but don't run your fingers through it
that's not a good look because what
happened is it's going to disturb the
curls the curl pattern and you're going
to end up with this big of main of a
mess okay that's the best way I can put
it but yeah this hair is from Diamond
virgin hair um also one thing on my
disappoint out as well that I really
liked about what they did this time
around which I don't think they did with
my other hair but that was a while ago
how you get your bundles and usually
when you receive them they have a rubber
band tied around them and then it's
usually like a ribbon or something
whatever to come and prefer they did
like this cute little white room which
is very minor but I liked it a lot
because I you know in the way but um it
was just a cute little white rope and it
made it cuz I just don't like when I in
my bundles and then because of the
rubber band they've been all so tight
that you get this big dent at the top of
your hair so when you start putting your
hair in all your hair at the top is just
SuperDuper flat because of that
rubberband but they did have rubber
bands on them but they weren't tied so
tight where I couldn't really do much
with them but they're West are very well
constructed that's why I believe that
I'm not getting much shedding because I
don't like to sell my works because it's
a messy and time-consuming process but
um if I needed to I tend to do it
more so on curly hair than I would ever
do on straight here because curly hair
sometimes ends up being um a little pain
in the butt but this one is good like
and I can't really say much more this
hair is really nice it's very curly it
lives up to its name and it does have
that kind of feel of my mouth
straightening hair but of course but of
course it's not straight it's curly
so yeah you guys are interested in his
hair make sure you guys hit up diamond
virgin here I'll put all the information
to this hair below again I don't know
what kind of closure this is I don't
know it was just in my palate closures
and I grabbed it because it was the most
similar to this hair but you could
achieve this with a straight closure
just get a good run I use my rating wand
uh it's like this like the medium sized
one I think I don't recall oh yeah
I will catch y'all in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
