gonna do an update on my hair right now
so this is my diamond virgin hair this
was their wavy slash curly hair that I
reviewed think about a week ago no it
was like two weeks ago and I just wanted
to come through and kind of give you
guys an update on how my hair has been
holding up this fall um what you're
saying right now is definitely not the
original crow pattern that was in it I
definitely changed it but you can get
this look by having I use a wand which
is my Remington wand and I think it's
the smallest one or the second smallest
one that they make and I just wanted all
I didn't brush them out or anything any
of the original curls that were in the
hair which you should probably see
somewhere on the screen right now it was
more looser at the bottom and then what
I did was because I had to my closure
was originally big wavy or straight it
was one of the two but I found the
closure in my bucket of hair and I
thought I'll just use this because they
did not send me one but this is what the
hair looks like um as once I wanted it
and again when you have curly hair of
some sorts and you don't really either
like the texture of the hair or you want
to change it real quick to give it a
different look I would definitely
consider just winding the hair because
it does make it easier to keep and hold
the curls these curl these I wanted this
hair like like three days ago I wanna
see and I put on a mannequin head and I
just kind of let it sit and I just let
them fall I wanted him really tightly
and I just let them sit and do what they
were gonna do and then it ended up being
this beautiful curly situation but I did
um after I did the review you guys know
like I said before I live in the valley
so it's really hot and hair and he don't
always kind of work in tandem they tend
to be not the best of both worlds so
what did I what I ended up doing was I
just wanted to see like how it held
though he got in a pool I got in a pool
with his hair especially with the
chlorine I wanted to see how I was gonna
hold up and it didn't do nothing more
which that's why I came back so quick to
do update like because I kind of send it
to the trenches I didn't post a video
the previous video that I did when I was
on the bike I was shooting my music
video and I was in the heat were in
Beverly Hills so you guys know it's just
palm trees and some trees but it's a lot
of light in that area so my hair held up
through that but I had only wand yet I
think I just the top area you guys know
so you if you just do like the outer
perimeter you can kind of get away with
it and that's what I did and then after
that was over I washed it then I co
washed it just to be on the safe side
and then once I did that um I went ahead
and Raimondi in my hair so yeah you guys
have this hair and you either don't like
the curl pattern or you love it but you
want to try something new or even if you
have just curling here in general I
personally would go ahead and try this
because it's very pretty
um it's very easy it's very bouncy is
very summery just don't do it on the day
when it's SuperDuper hot because no
matter how pretty the hair is it's very
aggravating and irritating to have your
hair this big and this you know and it's
all in your face and it's really hot we
have central air heating so therefore I
don't have to worry about that until I
walk my butt outside but yeah um I hope
you guys did enjoy this but anyway I
hope you guys enjoyed this and I will
talk to you later
say bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
