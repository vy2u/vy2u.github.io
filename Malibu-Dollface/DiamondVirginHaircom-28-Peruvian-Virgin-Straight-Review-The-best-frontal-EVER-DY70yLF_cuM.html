was a latte intro honey but my tresses
you know I always feel at home my hair
is this long 28 is usually my limit on
as long as I could go for a functioning
day and then anything longer I usually
do um so my hair is from a diamond
virgin hair now I have that beautiful
sparkly eyes box I don't know where the
hell I wasted those are guys so I am
wearing their Peruvian Striz a because
my hair is so long I use a step stool
here so you can see so this is one side
and I do put some blue in it as well
because I always just had all this
leftover blue color from my BOB I say
wait night and then this is the hair
pull it off to the front for y'all to
see now it is very very fine which I
love because it's not super thick as you
guys know I have like I think 34 inches
or 40 inch hair and that hair is really
full and then you get real hot real
quick so and I think it's you know my
signature which is my good old fat part
and then I also have a lace frontal by
them which I would say right now is the
best frontal half of 2017 nose even
though we're only in February y'all look
how far back my part goes
my truck don't start into right here so
here is where my trucks are I've never
in my life had a front or a frontal
people let me sit down be like this much
partying space like this is crazy
doesn't person here you guys have won me
over with the best frontal that I've
ever had so far I may have said this
about other companies but as of right
now Diamond version here gets all the
praise like I feel like Adele at the
Grammys to Beyonce thank you so again
look at just a bar girl I've never had
and I don't know what dimensions of
frontal this will be I will text them
and action because I don't remember what
what this would be considered because
under single person by six I was it
dirty before one of those I know what a
sex because usually I smart part usually
suffer got right here all this extra
that they gave me it a girl and the
thing that I loved about this it came
free plus something that I had to do was
um was all you got to do with bleaching
which it should be some footage now
I know
of you seeing how it looks before versus
after and IMAX why do you bleach
not because you don't like I don't think
people understand our frontals are made
with lace is that each each individual
pair is hooked into the lace cap so then
what happens is because all the hair is
knotted at the end you have all of these
knots that are like black and nobody
wants to look at that when you look very
close as somebody part like that to see
all of these last night so you take some
bleach this is the color and it ends up
giving you a very transparent and or
blond feel at the roots so it looks like
a scalp but the hair is coming I just
count because all of your hair from your
stuff and I always say this is about
just like a millimeter of transparency
then it starts to be actually become a
color just look at your scalp Linda oh
so that's what you do it but it bleached
with no problems this hair has given me
no issue guide you see and it is not
like you guys not have had I did the
same style with their me hair and that
hair was very very full and it had like
very um have weight on it this hair is
very light it is not heavy by a long
shot so that's one thing I do love about
it as well because if I'm trying to go
for more of this is great for the summer
just because of the simple fact that in
the summer time usually you don't want
you want long pretty hair but you don't
want it to be worse you know how to tell
that's not what you want so and then as
far as my color goes I just went ahead
and added a little bit of blue here and
a little bit of blue here just because I
was bored why not and also the crow is
here and then I decided against it just
because I like the way that it's blue
you know usually our curly when I'm just
feeling like I'm with you like the
straight looks too much it's cute curl
but it's not really cute but I wear this
either way this this they win either way
with me um they went either way with
what this would mean for sure okay so as
far as my bundles are concerned I do
have
four bundles of 28 inches and no
shedding none then I'm so is that even
hot glue gun this unit I sold this unit
and none I don't know what they're doing
but keep doing it I don't know where
they get the hair from who they benders
are but keep doing it and I also know
that this Harris version because as soon
as I hit it with that bleach to do this
little blue on the front my god it
picked up like nobody's video with
Caucasian honey so I love love Diamond
virgin hair they've never given me any
issues I love this their hair textures I
love the hair quality I love all of this
and again it's one of those things where
you can't really go wrong with the
quality here just because this hair is
really virgin hence why my hair is not
super bone straight but it is straight
it has more about natural feel to it
versus processed hair about me hair it
was extremely straight where it held a
curl but only for so long because the
texture of that hair was so straight so
I have no complaint if you're looking
for some balm straight groove in here I
got you covered but if you're looking
for a bomb-ass frontal girl you got it
this is ridiculous like I selected it
you know I've told you guys in the past
like I prefer I personally I always tell
you guys in the past especially I prefer
for myself for last week's only because
I like a really long part okay I feel
like the longer it is the more natural
is going to look the shorter it is and
more it's kind of telling that is weak
and girl you know change my mind is back
so if you guys aren't interested in a
diamond merchant hair and this year that
I have make sure that you guys hit the
links below and you guys will receive
them or this hair for sure because
officially this is on my favorite hair
and I think it's because of this damn
rock I girl
so again hit the links below thank you
for everybody a diamond virgin hair
thank you for you
sly hookers at home for watching and I
will catch out my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
