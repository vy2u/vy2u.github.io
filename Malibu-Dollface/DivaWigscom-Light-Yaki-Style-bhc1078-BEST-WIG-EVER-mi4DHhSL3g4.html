familiar I'm pretty sure because I said
there's anything I was like I feel like
I've had this before
um when I've seen the picture but when I
put this wig on y'all man so I'm gonna
get close so you can see the texture of
this hair real quick so this is what the
texture of the hair looks like flat
ironed it and I pressed the top of it
okay
this is their light yeah key now mind
you I've had a the first week that I
ever reviewed was a light yaki wig and I
love that wig but if you remember that
review you remember I had to sew tracks
into it because of the fact that it was
not full enough this is the first week
that I've received and I have a couple
of light yaki wigs but this one and this
is why I wanted to try it from them
because this is the only company that I
review for that offhand I can think that
has very good density in their wigs if
you look at how full this wig is this
will be beautiful curled so I'm going to
curl this wig I'm not gonna do it in
this video um but I am gonna curl it
i'ma switch my side part to a middle
part and I'm gonna want curl it just to
see how well it holds a curl because I
know a lot of you guys don't I wear a
lot of my hair straight only because you
know this is just my style this is my
signature this is what I like um but
this is not a still top unit either this
is a lacy unit as you can see there is
concealer all up in through that part
however from a distance it looks
beautiful darling um so that was my only
hang-up as far as this wig is concerned
I wore last night umm I wore to target
you know the girls like your hair your
wheat she said your weave looks amazing
and I was like thank you I didn't even
care to tell her that it was a wigs and
she didn't say your hair looks amazing
your weave looks amazing like I'm gonna
give you guys the specs on this week
this would have been so perfect as a
middle part so I'm gonna switch it cuz
now I kind of changed my mind I'm gonna
do
part because if so it's full enough for
middle part like sometimes the hair
sometimes a lot of times with wigs they
don't be full enough this wig does
by the way um sometimes the wigs don't
be fool enough to do like certain styles
so if it's not long enough then that's a
problem if it's not full enough that's a
problem this is both this is I think
this is 28 inches so this is where it
stops so it's a long unit if you're
trying to go for this long flowy thing I
only put a like literally one layer
which was right here too so it wouldn't
just be like on this side this I has no
layers in it and I did that on purpose
because if I switch this to a middle
part then what's going to happen that
these layers are going to be on this
side so I can cut everything evenly so
that's kind of a trick of you ain't new
so this the length of this wig is a 28
inch so I was right about that um I
think my other ones have been like 24
inches but that 4 inches make a world of
a difference and how the wig it feels in
it lays and because yo I'm just
impressed by the fullness of this wig I
know I did a review for another company
recently make up their density but their
density still was not this I'm just
gonna be honest it was not this so this
is amazing and it doesn't mimic
african-american relaxed hair very very
very like you can still see some of the
ridges and stuff in it which I like
because it looks like from from a
distance until I got a silky wig and
sometimes with silky wigs even when you
lay them very well and you put them on
they still don't look as believable um
because of your hair texture and I only
have just my baby hair out right here in
the front and it blends so well with
this like I love this about to be like
that other light yaki wig I worked that
wig until I could not wear it anymore
like it's I still have it I wonder if I
could find it I still have it matter of
fact this is my first wig I ever
reviewed this is my light yaki wig from
a different company and remember you
guys I had sold the tracks in here
because it wasn't full enough even
holding this
like this it feels full because it's not
bone straight but you can still see you
can still see a little bit of the ridges
in this but not like right here you can
kind of see it but not as much as this
one because this one's like fresh like I
haven't washed it yet so usually once
you wash it those the little pattern it
goes away um but this week is still
holding up the cap and all of that good
stuff is still good in the still top of
it is still good um but I don't wear
this wig as much as I used to because
look the part is just a permanent is it
gonna be in this weird um but I don't
wear this wig as much as I used to
because of wigs like this that I get to
have a lot of more texture to it and
they're much thicker the tracks always
help to add value to it but you don't
want to have to do that especially if
you're spending your money yeah when you
pay that amount of money you don't want
to have to do anything but you know make
it look marvelous and put it on jogging
an a-plus-plus plus extra plus for me
right now no we'll see what this do in
the meantime if it's gonna hold up as
long as that one it's been holding up so
far all my wigs that I do have from them
have held up after Co watches and
sulfate washes so I'll see what this
week does but as of right now I'm in
love this is literally my favorite wig
right now because it's simple it's to
the point it stays on straight the only
hang-up and the only thing I hate about
light yaki wig is that when it gets hot
like the back of your neck they don't
they're not like silky here where there
it goes like this you gotta grab a comb
or something in you know because if you
want girl and start a brush fire back
there because the texture is so
different and it's so dense it doesn't
want to separate like it's supposed to
but other than that I'm good like I love
this wig so I'm going to finish giving
you the proper specs before I got into a
tangent the color is a 1 so it's a
jet-black that's another thing that I
like about this as well it's just jet
black
most of the wigs that I do review is
more of my natural hair color which
would be a 1 like a 1b which is of
course an off black but this is a jet
black ok and oh
I just love black hair y'all ain't
nothin like black hair is nothing like
it like it something about black hair
they just transformed me into a
completely different person I love color
you guys know I love me a good color but
oh it's just somethin bout it my my cap
size is a small so you guys know always
get a size small cuz they they fit
better on because I always put mine
behind my hairline so I don't want like
too much cap because it's gonna get
saggy in the back you doesn't cute the
lace is a light brown of course my
favorite um I'm gonna come back with a
video probably next week cuz this week
is kind of packed um
and I'm gonna do it now I'm not gonna
really call it a tutorial it's gonna be
more of a walkthrough to show you guys
how I kind of wanna curl this hair
because I like the length that it is and
I don't want to cut it in the length off
so if I was to do a style I'll have to
do a lot of cutting which would defeat
the purpose because it will make the wig
thin again
um so like when I do the middle part
with the waves like that's why I only
usually do that on wefted hair because
that hair can take it and I have five
bundles to cut and still have hair left
this hair not so much if I once I start
cutting is gone and I don't want to end
up with a thin wig when it was thick
originally you got I'm sayin so that's
why I kind of tend to like to wear these
wigs straight versus putting a lot of
curl in them but I want to do some long
just big uniform waves in it and see how
it looks so I'll be back with this I'll
put all the information to this wig
below and I can kind of say before even
like get into another week I have this
wig for two and a half weeks so far I'm
gonna tell you it's worth the money
period
and I never say that but this wig is
worth the money if you want a very
natural african-american relaxed look to
your hair this is the perfect hair for
that very purpose so if you want some
long hair but you don't want to look too
Brazilian or you're not trying to look
too shiny you know because sometimes
when the luster is too shiny y'all say
you have a bit of an issue with trying
to make it look realistic so this like
look at this this look all looks natural
is shiny but it's not glistening it
ain't the shining
jacket so I'll talk to you guys in this
next one let me know if you guys like
this one dude cuz to me imma leave y'all
with this it feels different I've had a
lot of side part black straight wigs
before but this one feels different for
whatever reason I don't know if it's the
color the texture the length I don't
know what it is but it feels very
different to me so yeah let me know what
you guys think and I'll talk to you on
the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
