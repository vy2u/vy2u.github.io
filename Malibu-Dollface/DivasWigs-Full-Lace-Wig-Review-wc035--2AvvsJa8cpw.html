hi guys so today is another wig review
um guys not right now I'm like really
obsessed with wigs like I'm just going
in and out of them and I'm loving it in
this one it's no different um this
particular unit is from with the fun of
the box Harris from divas late no divas
week on I was hitting this place with
diva Swisscom um this unit that I'm
wearing is number cold WT 0 3 5 is 24
inches and it's in a 1b okay this is the
box what the box looks like when you get
it is obviously like this it comes with
a little paper to keep in the wig the
lunch lady knit and then it comes with a
brush
now this brush I will say is a very
equality because are there's another
community that I get wigs from that they
send me a brush like a wooden brush and
it's not this one is actually like a
finished brush which I love because you
know what these are good with brushes I
didn't use this one in particular but as
you can see it's a plastic but it is it
also comes with an instruction guide and
I didn't just seen is anyone look but it
actually comes with it says wait cat but
it's a wig liner this is what you're
supposed to do always have to pull the
top out oh that's real cute I don't do
that but that's real cute um well yeah
it tells you on the back what you should
do with the wig when you get it or
whatever
I didn't notice I was wondering what I
had the whole like stuff when I got a
few of them so I'm gonna give you the
do's and not the do's and don'ts so what
I liked and what I do not like about
this particular unit the unit is pulled
behind my hairline and as you can see
right here all of my hair in the front
is left out and it's pulled over to give
me this volume is I so meant the
luminous situation that's going on right
now which I really do like um now when I
received it it had this very
explaining when I received it has this
the the waves are the curls however you
want to pretty much state this
particular unit had these um they were
partnered pretty much like it would be
like kind of how this is it was like
this so I could see through the unit
when I got and I was like okay it's
gonna be thin
oh yeah no I feel about ten units the
more the hair the better you know if
it's distributed ly correctly so I'm
just kind of like I don't think I'm
alike it but as I brushed through it I
use a powder brush kind of like that one
but it's my big silver one I used that
one it broke up the curls and it gave it
this look so the hair looks like this so
has like this nice little wave to it um
I did put hairspray in it because I
needed to hold and give me some value
minutes because it was very flat when I
put it on which is not keep with this
particular type of hair I decided to do
no part today because um this unit one
of the things that don't like is that
the parting space is not a lot it's
probably about this much well follow
that much and then it's like the band
and then it can still ace continues but
that band that's right here kind of
kills the part so then it's like this
big hump and then apart continues which
I don't like so the part explains always
has about four inches give or take um so
that's one thing I don't like about the
unit and I would never wear part with it
because you guys know I like my parts to
be really really really far back like
here and I couldn't do that properly
with this and it's all lace is not still
top now one of the things that I did
notice on the side is that they did not
have any soap pop units which sucks
because you guys know little up
way but they didn't have any but
everybody doesn't like till top just
like everybody like myself just I'm not
afraid to rigs but you know they are
nice so yeah I may already have much
more to say about the particular wig
it's nice as the great are the density
for this particular step I don't know if
you straighten this would it be the
thickest I'm not
really think so I wouldn't do that if I
was you but for this particular wig this
is a nice texture it's kind of a get up
and go type of wig and like I said you
could part it if you really wanted to if
that was something that you were
interested in obvious that go ahead it's
just not necessarily for me in this
situation but yeah again the wig is a
diva's wigs calm I haven't experienced
much shedding just a little bit when I
was coming through with the powder brush
to kind of get through the curls to in
the waves to separate but besides that
that was all oh if you liked this video
