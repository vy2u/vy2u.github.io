forget something it'll be all below okay
but I came to talk about this wig that I
am rocking right so now um this wig is
actually from this front from divas wigs
you guys know I work with divas wig
numerous times and you know that I just
really really recently reviewed a wig um
similar to this one but the roots came
they were really long they came to about
right here and I wanted um like a Barbie
wig but you know I don't I have a wig
you guys my iconic on Versace League but
I had that wig and it reminds me of Kurt
of course Barbie because of the Brutes
are still white but I can't wear that
without either bleaching my hair or
makeup trick that I wanted to do and I
just didn't want to do it with this so I
decided to just put back over my Barbie
mosquito stuff and put my pink backdrop
back up because I felt it was necessary
and I put my blue contacts in um so I
feel like looking I'm looking
um but yeah my goal is to go from RV and
then I got a mosquito belt when I'm
skinny pants um that all came from the
same Barbie collection
um this wig is I will say um by all the
blonde wigs that I've received is
usually something wrong with them and
usually it's either the density or the
UM the lustre and how the hair was
treated after it was colored this I will
say by far is the best blonde wig I have
had because it's great on the density
and the luster is great but it's still
healthy like the bottoms of this hair
they not afraid they're not like dried
out like everything in this hair is
perfect so I'm going to get to the stats
on this week as well so if you're
looking to or
and by the way divas waist is coming up
in the world okay they have given this
new like return form slash pamphlet and
it lets you know like all their
information and their VIP if you want to
return it this is the information it's
very official I like that you can be a
silver or gold member um you gotta buy
at least nine hundred dollars for this
or for silver you have to have three
fifty to nine hundred dollars
that ain't horrid bond weights because
they are very expensive so yes okay so
I'm so into this so to the stats so um
the skewed number is a b HC one zero
seven eight the hair length is the 26
inch not twenty-eight um i did measure
this it is a true twenty-six inch for
sure e my roots are the color of the
hair is 613 but my roots are black so my
bruce will be a one so it's like a one
straight into a six thirteen usually it
goes from black brown like my other one
did this it was black brown and then it
went to the six thirteen but they just
skipped the whole brown part so it goes
straight into um a six thirteen which i
do like i don't mind it at all it isn't
i'm because it's a gradiation it's not
just blunt like i've seen some other
wigs may be blunt but they did a good
job
oh I want to know who they colorist is
the color it's did this okay texture is
a silky texture which is it's very true
this hair is very silky and very
straight as you can see has a very very
straight texture to it
um the my lace color is a light brown um
you guys know eyes get like brown this
is um my concealer it should be over
like bed they're going ah my concealer
is who just asked me about my concealer
from always Missy Lynn asked me and it's
the I think it's the NC forty-three I
don't remember but it'll be below the
concealer that I use for my part um if
you around my color or something similar
to it this short because remember your
part is always lighter than your
skintone not crazy light but lighter
then it usually would be you know um my
cap size is a petite and you guys know
all my cap sizes are petite they just
small because I got small ated um we go
through this every review I got a small
head in the big face okay
the cap instruction is a cap number
three which is glueless lace a lot of
people always ask me what this is the
difference between a glueless wig and a
regular weight and to be honest with you
nothing arm the the purpose of one is
that this one does not require me to
bond it down now if I brought a regular
wig and just cut the lace up I could do
this exact same look so I guess when you
purchase them the reason why they
actually that because they have
different like they when they send them
out they have different reasons um I
don't think that the Swiss lace that
would be on this would be any different
from the Swiss lace that would be on
that one I just think that maybe the
lace the way is put in it I don't know
don't give me the line cuz I don't know
however I like this wig a lot um it came
with you know the normals they came with
a brush which I never use these verses
but they come with them on when I have
my weak self I'm gonna make sure I can
ease with the the week that I'm selling
um and this came with a wig cap and it's
the ones you know I hate the
measurements that don't do nothing but
make it just those are work good with
the silk top cuz they don't you know you
can't see through because this is lace
if I put this over this and before I put
the concealer in my part you will be
able to see every last part of the cap
because of the fact that that's not a
solid cap like under this I have a solid
brown cap one and it just came with this
which is the wig was in this this was
whip in the wig as well and then came
with this paper that there isn't any um
itself um I will say that this hair has
a nice amount of shedding it's not crazy
not excessive and I know when I have
blonde hair and I have one wig I have
one wig um that I had to send back if
you guys know it the wigs are bad I
don't review them I send them back to
the company um and usually these are
newer companies that are just starting
out and this was a company I had never
worked
and they had sent me a blonde wig it was
like probably a little bit lighter than
this and I think that whoever colored it
had over processed it because what I
started having with it was just clumps
of hair of and I had blonde
hair everywhere look like Barbie had a
really drunken night in my house and it
was a problem so I know when you know
blonde hair is not good and it's not a
quality and it's just not the cute you
know thing I know when something is
wrong but as far as this goes it's great
it had lace in the back when I received
it it doesn't have an adjustable strap
so because I have the lace in the back
where you could bond it down if you
wanted to but it is snug so the wig
wouldn't go anywhere I mean if you pulls
it it will come off it doesn't have any
combs in it neither so I don't mind that
because I tend to not like homes because
combs even though they are like bendable
like you know they look like um remember
like old-school banana clips like those
but they smaller and they usually put
them like one in the front and then two
on the sides and it's usually two in the
back but if they don't bend what they
tend to do is make your hair look bulky
and big and boxy because they don't
usually want to UM look flat when you
have your wiggling unless you have like
curling hair a wavy hair but if it's
straight hair like this is really flat
as usually doesn't lay flush to your
head which is not attractive at all by a
long shot when I do have them I tend to
go ahead and cut them out anyway but
this hair mm-hmm I'm feeling just like
I'm Barbie oh well I like it like I'm
trying to get into new colors now I was
I know I say this like every time I get
a blonde wig I'm like I was going to
color it because I was going to color it
this pink not this thing but this thing
and I don't think I wanted to be but
once I tried it on I was like it's
Barbie like well I mean I'm Barbie has
pink hair does but I don't want to be
looking like a Jessica dime penny um you
know I don't only want to look like that
so yeah this is from divas wigs it has a
very good
I saw the luster to it like it's like a
little baby as a very bit straight it's
very straight it doesn't have no type of
texture to it at all it's just straight
and silky that's all you're gonna get
from this but it is nice it's not as
light however as my other my my other
than have more like a that you can't
tell on camera but this one has more of
a yellowish blonde which would be like
Malibu Barbies blonde I'll put her
picture right here this is like the
blonde that I liked the other one was
more like a whitish line um like a white
s planner or pure white blonde but this
one is more like a yellow blonde like a
dirty or no not very blunt this would be
way over but yeah I want to try like a
brown like like this but I want like a
brownish copper color I think that would
be really cute but you guys know for the
longest time again I had issues with
trying to find blond hair that match my
skin tone and you would think it would
be easy for me but it really wasn't it
was very difficult to find some blonde
that was just like popping like this so
yeah make sure you guys check the info
below and um I will catch you in the
next no I'm just like like Barbie though
okay bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
