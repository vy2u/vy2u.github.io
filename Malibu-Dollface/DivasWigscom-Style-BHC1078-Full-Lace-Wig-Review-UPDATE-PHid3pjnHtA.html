an update on this wig that I reviewed I
think oh yeah last Friday because that's
where my reviews went up this is my wig
from divas wigs and this is my one and a
half week post update because I've been
wearing this wig non-stop since last
Friday I wanna point out there is a
bosom rondell that is not respectful to
my face right now so just don't mind
that this big bumpy glare that y'all
lookin at
um I should have went for a more matte
finish today I've been gone it is seven
or seven and I've been gone since 7:05
this morning this wig has I will say I
was a little bit wrong
a little bit having a thinner wig
although I still would have Chu chosen
for this weight to be a little bit
thicker than what it is but because of
how not full it is it has very much work
for me because I will say if this was
thicker like some other units I noticed
that even in the winter months like now
I tend to sweat because it's so much
hair against my neck like if I put on a
beanie or if I have a jacket on or
something and I didn't get that with
this and I've been going all day when I
was at you all day I did my hair cuz I
washed this unit so I've been gone for
over for about twelve hours so I did my
hair yesterday I washed it and shampooed
it I don't know if I ever mentioned this
to you guys but when I wash and shampoo
my are straight units I use Johnson and
Johnson's baby shampoo because I find
that Johnson and Johnson gets the dirt
out um unless the wig is just
ridiculously dirty then I'll use a
clarifying shampoo but you know after a
flatiron and all of this a wig for so
long it tends to make the hair hard and
I noticed that Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson is is
easier on the hair because it's made for
babies it gets the dirt out but it also
keeps the hair feeling very soft and of
course you want your unit to feel like
it did when you first got it and this
hair was ridiculously soft but from me
you know Flatiron it almost every other
day
it wasn't filling and soft as I would
like it it was definitely it still did
this it still flowed it's still moved
but you know I know the difference so
that's what I use I did that what she
says phrase so I did that Wednesday
night so yesterday was Thursday I flat
ironed it reported it which was much
easier this time and I don't know if
that has anything to do with the shampoo
but it just seemed like it was much
easier for me to be part the hair this
time around and it was the first time I
don't know and these are still the
layers that were cut into it when I
first got it nothing has really changed
there and then also I wanted to mention
which I neglected to mention in my
initial review because some people were
asking and wanting to know like if they
wanted this unit like you like the style
and you like the cut or the color or
whatever and you wanted to try it out at
home is there a possible way that you
can get this in a thicker density and
yes most companies if not all hair
companies and/or wig companies offer an
option to have thicker density this was
a stock wig in stock ways are pretty
much the wigs that are ready to ship
this was a ready to ship wig if you
wanted it thicker I took a look at the
site and I will say this their density
prices are way way way cheaper than
other hair and wig sites I've seen
companies are charged up to a extra
hundred dollars just for a 120 density
when their density is only one no it's
an extra ten dollars for 120 and it's an
extra twenty dollars for 150 now let me
explain this is a hundred percent
density okay this is everything that I
showed you this is what you get for 100%
100% density it varies from company to
company so let's use this as an example
Reebok size 7 is not the same as a
converse size 7 you get what I'm saying
so it really just varies some companies
give you more some give you less some
give you the same it just it just really
depends um these wigs are like other
wigs that I told you guys that are way
from different companies that I will
shown I mentioned in this company's
review so what you can do is for an
extra twenty dollars which it is extra
money but it's not crazy
twenty dollars ten dollars it's not
horrible you can get an extra density a
120 density is pretty much our I will go
for a lot of you guys who like your hair
a little bit thicker but not crazy that
would be perfect for you that's an extra
ten dollars it's not gonna hurt um for
you guys who like your hair super thick
um so obviously like a Tamar you want
your bank may be real stupid then you
will go with the 150 density and I've
never had no I have I've had one
one-on-one 50 density wig and that was
when I had the gratings and the reason
why my hair was so full and so thick is
because that unit was custom it took a
while to get to me and cutting those
bangs were held because when they were
cut and they were so thick it's really
hard to deal with the hair when it's so
full and I think I was rushing here too
so it was real thick so think about that
I would say the average for somebody who
doesn't like the hair super thick but
they want it long and flowy I would
stick with this if you wanted a little
bit thicker into your liking with a
little more weight on it go for the 120
but if you just want to get crazy with
it then bump it up to the 150 just
realize that 150 density is thick okay
it may not sound thick but 50% more
density from this is a lot so yeah
that's the difference so if you guys
have any questions again um put them
below remember to visit divas wigs as
well I'll put the link for this
particular wig below as well as my
original review for this wig and it's
holding up nicely I haven't had any
shedding I haven't had I mean I got like
three four strands during the whole
entire washing process which was good it
didn't bother me at all and um yeah I
haven't had any problems because I
washed this wig real good so if it was
mangled y'all would know I was
like y'all miss a ball but it actually
is very very pretty it's still flowy and
it's a little bit I think it's from what
I use this to shine here because I
didn't put anything in this one
afterwards it's too shiny and has a nice
realistic luster to it so yeah I will
talk to y'all in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
