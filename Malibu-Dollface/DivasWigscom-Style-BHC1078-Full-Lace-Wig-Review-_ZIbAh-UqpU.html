I know it looks familiar but it's not
okay so this is from divas wig and you
guys know I think this is my second
review for them I had reviewed like a
loose wave and I kind of worried just
kind of very natural um last week that I
had from them and I was a while ago so
they sent me this wig and this week
looks very familiar to some other wigs
that I have but I'll give you of course
the pros and the cons are the things
that I do and I don't like about this
wig and the specs as well
alright the culture this wig is BHT
one zero seven eight it's a 26 inch in
the color is number one so this is not a
woman B this is black this is very
similar to another wig that I've been
wearing and I probably yeah I wore that
wig in my first part of my love and hip
hop review but it's clearly not the same
company when I received it it came with
this instructional for daily use guide
so that you guys who don't know what
you're doing you can get a little help
it also came with this brush slash comb
that I could have used for the hair
which is really nice I must say I don't
use brushes like this on wigs because
they don't seem to kind of get what I
want but these are good for flyaways
these are good a little spray and it'll
be great um so that was nice yet they
sent this with it as well now the pros
and cons about this particular way um it
took a nice amount of adjusting to get
the wig to where it is right now which I
really don't like me
trying to party was it was a hassle and
I don't really like that because it's
not necessarily the hair its how the
hair is put into the wig so whoever
their manufacturer are the way that
though the hairs are being placed into
the wig are causing the hairs to not
want to lay down when I'm trying to do
it this could have been much flatter
than what it is right now but honestly
my other one is SuperDuper flat I wanted
a little bit of body still left in this
after I did it I'll pull all the hair to
the front so that you can see how thick
it is because it's the the thinness is
kind of crazy so this is how I usually
know when a wig is thin because if my
ear wants to be shown like this then
that means that the hair is not as full
and I wear my when I have long black
hair it's always the same I always make
sure I party on the side of the cap and
then I'll see none of my other ways to
do this but this one is yeah it's thin
it's it doesn't look crazy thin but if I
throw it or something like that
it's then it says it's a hundred percent
it was yeah the hundreds in density so
you might want to go up to like a 120 um
a 130 150 is kind of pushing it because
then that means the Parden starts to get
real thick um but yeah I don't really
like that that's the only thing that I
really don't like you guys know I have
this thing about the fullness of wigs
and because wigs cost a nice pretty
penny you want to be able to get the
most hair you can for it because I only
have this issue with a couple of
companies every company isn't like this
most companies will send me a wig and it
has like my red wig it's it's the
perfect density and I think maybe you do
use wigs and maybe some other companies
might want to up their density just a
little bit because it would allow the
customer to get a little more bang for
the amount of money that they're paying
but besides that it has um adjustable
strap in the back and there are two
combs on each side of the cap
it's for late there is no so top it's
just a regular lace and it flattened
great the texture though it feels a
little yak like it would be like its
lightest lightest yaki I think that's
what I would call it because it doesn't
feel silky it feels like my other yaki
wigs um Phil I mean you can kind of see
it a little bit like you see what I'm
saying it's like it got that little yaki
Ridge in it um but it's when you
Flatiron it it's a really easy the one
thing the one good thing about thin wigs
is that it does not take no time to
Flatiron him to kind of get to where you
want your weight to look like so that's
the good thing about it but the only
downside about it is that this is not
really enough hair to do much of
anything with besides were straight like
if I put curls in this no it's no I
would have four bit curls and it's not
just this company it's a lot of other
companies that should really consider
putting more hair or making their prices
a little cheaper because you know to pay
three four hundred hours for a wig and
the wig is just this thin is not okay
now I have gulags of hair so to solve
this problem I just take oh half of the
left and put it in a wig and then I'm
everything is fine but as far as like
you know laying it it took a little bit
of elbow grease to get the part in
because you know it didn't really want
to do what in I'm not gonna lie some
lace wigs or a little bit easier than
others two-part but most silk top ways
which I'm so used to wearing um they
part like a charm so yeah it could just
be the fact that I haven't really dealt
with the lace wig like this for a while
they usually have just been like silk
tops with lace in the back so I am the
part that wait I don't know but it just
gave me a little bit of a problem in it
you know okay so yeah anyway if you guys
like this wig um let me know I will be
coming back doing an update on this
particular wig and just let me know how
you like it you know it's not really
nothing crazy different from what I've
done before I've done
I part with black hair before it's not
you know new but um let me go Lin also
let me ask you guys cuz maybe it's just
me at the bottom let me know if you
prefer a thinner wig that you can put
tracks in or would you like a thick wig
that you can kind of thin out like you
know or how do you guys like our wake
see y'all like I'm finding you like I'm
thin
do you like a medium I'm like do you
think this is thin or do you think this
is cool like you let me know y'all
standpoint cuz I can only go about what
I like so let me know what you guys like
below and I will talk to you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
