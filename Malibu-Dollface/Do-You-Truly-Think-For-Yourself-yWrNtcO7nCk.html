into the video if I seem a little bland
hopefully it'll pick up in this video
but I am extremely extremely tired like
ridiculous like it took every ounce of
my mean to get up here into this video
today because I know I promised videos
every week and I'm still trying to get
into the mix of getting back to doing
them fully we went to a broken leg show
last night at they pick up so will from
the airport this morning only got like
an hour and half of sleep Oh ladies cool
alright so the oh and for those who are
about to act this hair is still machine
and hair Emporium here this is the same
here that I had in in the last video
it's been about two and a half weeks now
since I've had this hair put in and it's
been I watched it last week and flat
ironed it and everything and it's still
rolling when I flat ironed it is still
had I mean washed it it's still the crow
came back so yeah I'll be doing a full
update on this hair very soon as how is
um been holding up or whatever so yeah
um the topic I'm gonna do today is about
thinking for oneself and when I was on
my break this is one of the topics that
kept coming to mind and the reason why I
can't come into mine is because I've
noticed just looking around in life when
certain situations come up a lot of you
people the viewers the consumers the
parents the children the American do not
listen to your first mine you will not
think with your own mind you will think
with a surrogate mine meaning the news
word-of-mouth gossip but you won't
actually sit back and take
the time to sit back and really research
would sure what you're thinking so
that's basically what this video is
gonna be about and what I mean by that
is a lot of you and I say you because
you know we're all the same a lot of us
I should say will take the next person's
word for something versus take a little
time out of our day to look up whatever
we're talking about whatever we're
whatever this topic may be for instance
I had questions about 9/11 I had
questions about the moon landing I've
had questions about religious things and
everything that I've ever wanted to know
I was able to look up and get a
definitive answer to it and I don't need
a definitive answer to from man I mean a
definitive answer to history most of you
go to church right I mean I mean if you
don't go to church you'll probably have
some type of spiritual foundation such
as the church the Muslims Buddhism you
know your Catholic you know you get it
okay a lot of you guys have grown up in
your religion and you just stick to it
as you grow up which is completely fine
because if that's what you're raised on
and that's what you're taught to do that
that's that's completely fine but a lot
of you guys especially on Twitter I will
see you question a lot of things kind of
underhandedly but you don't really ask
because you don't want to be you're
you're afraid to be looked at funny by
your peers so you'll come out say
something kind of sort of but not really
to kind of see if somebody a bite in a
real what you're saying versus coming
out and simply saying it for those who
follow me on Twitter and when I was very
active on Facebook you know that I a lot
of times I would say things that a lot
of people didn't really agree with we're
just completely fine that's okay I don't
care um but it's how I feel and I'm
allow somebody to dictate how I feel
because they don't they're too afraid to
be just as brave as I am and say exactly
how they feel your opinion is never
wrong
it's all in how you do it so I said that
to say this what you ever in life have a
question something of a mean question
something question about something oh
it's not it's not bad questions okay you
can ask anybody anything is what their
answer is gonna be is it if you are a
Christian and you are in church and you
guys go through palms whatever and you
don't understand something or you don't
feel that this was it made enough sense
and it did not coincide with the
previous chapter then you ask your
pastor you acts a system you ask
somebody in the pulpit you ask the
Deaconess you ask the drummer you ask
somebody because somebody will probably
give you an answer and if anybody in
life ever gives you the answer it's cuz
that's not an answer that's a cop-out so
there is a difference understand that
just cuz it's not an answer that's
because they don't know so I said this
to say that if you are in anything
understand what you're in and if you do
not understand it and ask questions
because it will not hurt questions can
only make your knowledge better
questions can only enlighten you or what
you do not know but if you sit back and
you take other people's advice about
what should be what and what is what
then you're running down the street with
something that somebody made up because
they were too lazy to get they asked up
read about it research and really find
out exactly what it is
so stop allowing the news to be your
news allow you use your mind use your
own because it's there we
as humans we were only used to we only
use 10% of our brain period at that so
if you have that little ad section right
here that you're using
make sure it's worthwhile you know like
you you may know every honest on you may
know every pair of Louboutins came out
last season you I may know every
Barbie's friends name but I am very
knowledgeable of other things that are
going on in life and I don't necessarily
mean going on across the world because
personally and call me what you want but
I don't really give a about what's
going on across the world when our ship
has already up as it is and we
can't even get our right so why
would I give a about what they got
going on over there I'm just saying I'm
not being heartless I'm just being
honest it makes no sense we as Americans
are so quick to go help someone else and
as soon as some happens to us well
somebody come to our rescue
probably not we're broke asses so how
are we so broke helping somebody else
I'm just saying that's just a question
and I'm not beat like I said I'm not
being insensitive I'm just being really
honest right now how the are you
gonna help somebody else if you cannot
help yourself what we have enough tow
people on Skid Row
but you want to send food clean across
the world and there's no jobs there's no
like what like what the so I'm just
saying I understand there are starving
children yes but we have starving
children that are down the street and
you pass them every day but yet until
you send 75 cents every single day
across the land
probably the kids that's probably not
even getting it but you can give this
child that sitting on your doorstep
every morning 75 cents take that
to McDonald's and get them something to
eating you know for a fact that they're
getting it but yet instill you as people
we ask people do not understand
like that we let the mainstream media
brainwash us to believe that this is the
thing
and these are things that we're supposed
to do do you understand that the amount
of you can do for your own people
and I don't say people as far as a race
but I mean people as Americans people as
neighbors people as the people right
next to you these are the people that
you can't you have to build a foundation
in order to branch out a tree does not
float a tree has branches and
the branches will branch off to other
 to make a beautiful tree but there
is no foundation there will be no
 tree it's gonna be brown it's
gonna be nasty and it ain't gonna be
 so when you allow like the
government to put in your head to
believe that this is what really
happened because they want money out of
you then you're gonna keep falling for
this and a lot of this that
I'm telling you right now a that
can be found on the Internet
and these are not crazy people these are
facts these are things that have been
around for as long as your
great-great-great great-great
grandparents so it's not it's
not conspiracy it's not dumb if you
could you wouldn't know because if and
I'm going to say this and believe what
you want we people are programmed to be
a certain way okay understand that we
are programmed to look a certain way act
a certain way drive a certain way
everything has structure because there's
a higher I guess you could say chain of
demand that's making sure that what they
have going on
stays how they want it so do you
honestly believe that if you're hearing
something on the news about a world wide
catastrophe that it is 100% the truth no
it's been filtered because our news is
being told by someone else higher than
the news people
you get it 911 was very devastating yet
and still you have people who can give
you first-hand accounts that you never
see interviewed you have people who were
there that window that lost limbs
that told you a totally different story
that the media told yet still they never
talked about that all this money that's
being sent to these feed the children
foundations and yet in still 15 20 years
later there's still huts with no ground
no carpet no foundation no furniture
still flies and I'm not trying to be
funny I'm just being honest
where's the money going there are people
who donate every single month where is
the money going you guys should be able
to build some found that you shouldn't
be still using the same commercial ten
years later you get do you guys
understand me do you follow me do you
get it you have to be proactive in life
you have to do research for yourself
because the answers that you're looking
for are in your face but if you're so
consumed with like Twitter and
updating your status on Facebook and
worrying about somebody kicking you and
making sure that you got your iMessage
you're missing the point
you're missing the fact that you're
being used as a tool I I'm the type of
person amongst a lot of you who I go to
the beat of my own drum just because I
may look a certain way doesn't mean
that's who I am just because that's the
only thing that you can identify me as
that doesn't mean that's what I am you
get what I'm saying I'm not here to
confirm to I am Who I am no matter
what the situation would you say when
they say what he may say because I only
won't answer to one person that's it I
don't have there's not a on
this earth
the fear of my heart understand that no
matter what they may say what they may
do what they may carry what they may
shoot what they may stab it does not
make a difference to me because I
understand how the game is played and
when you understand the game you know
how to play when you're just a pawn and
the that's when you get lost
and that's what started she starts to
happen
you catch on oh so late that you've been
 play with to the point where
you're out the game what's the point now
you didn't get it but this was
being told to you a lot of dishes that
jumping is funny and it's trendy and
it's in people's names on Twitter that's
just not funny and it's very real
understand it is very much real and
you're feeding into it that makes you a
corporate okay that's like you being a
corporation and I ask you to be and I'm
doing some and I ask you to
come along with me come play this game
with me that's all you're doing you're
feeding into it everything is
orchestrated understand that and if you
look closely you can see through the
lines so learn to think for yourself
learn to use your brain is there for a
reason
learn to use it because once you start
seeing the that I'm seeing and
that everybody else is seeing it was
definitely enlighten you as an
individual to know what is good and what
is not good for you is there open your
eyes okay
