to be disrespectful are rude to anyone
of the LGBTQ community this is simply
our opinions about how we feel based on
our experience with other gays in our
community if somehow somewhere you are
offended then this channel may not be
for you and if you really have a problem
with you can just simply just the fuck
do they make you like that looking like
a hot shitty mess partner okay so this
video is called doll face and stir wheel
while yes it's rude bitches now often
people hit us up and what do they
usually say to you other people or why
are y'all so standoffish do y'all feel
like y'all better now I got an email
from somebody that will remain nameless
you know who you are
bitch but they call a self as the gay
people called I mean we cave arena but
it's a niche I know reading me and that
was read an email so he gonna say you
know what I don't understand I'm gonna
just paraphrase it didn't I say I don't
understand why you want so we'll act
like y'all can't you know functions with
the other gays or y'all don't talk to
the other youtubers are you I feel like
y'all just too much or y'all didn't let
the fame go to your head I want to know
what Fame you're talking about don't you
still say that we still sitting in the
house okay I get no chick huh
yeah yes I mean I'm not getting a check
neither tea we're doing this on our own
motherfucking accord
now listen I give Fame mixed up with
popularity that's the difference okay
so if you throw some type away and be
better rich and I don't know some bitter
hoes apparently them
what I'm trying to figure out what the
issue is if I don't want to speak to you
if I don't want to chew and chew when
you come to my town and I don't talk to
you on Twitter and I'm not trying to be
your bestie and I don't want you to have
my number
bitch get over it we ain't cool I don't
know you're rapping talk to you I don't
talk to you I've always been that type
of person before I got on YouTube so
ain't no Fame change me bitch cuz I want
to know where the fame is coming from
cuz you ain't seen my ass walk across
MTV in about three years so therefore
when you when I get some fame I'll let
you know
cuz this backdrop I have my face on it
yep that's Michael back there that ain't
me so I don't understand that why why
are people get upset at the fact that we
you know we we we mind our own business
I don't let me a lot of people are messy
and cocky and we're not like that so we
just think we might hold my fucking
business and you should too mmm-hmm I
don't feel the need to be friends with
everybody I don't feel like I'm better
than nobody I feel like I shouldn't mind
my fucking business
that's what the fuck I feel pick and
choose who our friends are and we don't
she's my friend right if I just met you
and I subscribe to your channel that on
me you ain't got my number new uncaught
when I when I'm hurt about some personal
shit oh when he's singing mary j blige
from over some Heartbreak Hotel sick
it'll call you he calls me because we're
friends
Sophie okay with that out there now hey
they don't know nothing al could you
just brought it to shit up no anyway but
you know saying that's what friends do
you know I don't talk to you and a
friend is not somebody in my book that
you saw to every so often that you see
every so often you're somebody on
Twitter that I speak to that's bottom
line that's the difference I don't feel
like I'm better I'm not a bitch I don't
you know yeah
I just do me I do here I'm just doing me
that's the difference that's just that
hook line and sinker bottom line that's
it I mind my own business
we mind our own business I'm not in I'm
gonna do I why are you still worried
about let's not be a friends with you
and this is not just one person this is
not - this is not ten this is not twelve
this is a whole no but yeah I'm just
that's my whole thing I mean I don't I
don't understand it I don't hate it
what's with the Kraken what I don't
understand and then people get offended
when we say stuff like this I don't kick
it with gay people here you go some are
only one where the only gay people we
kick it with we are each other's friends
we have other friends like broken she's
gay when she's a lesbian the same thing
but you know um that's it and I have
other friends that are you know but
other than that you know that's about it
you know I keep we keep our inner circle
very small and the reason behind that is
because you have a lot of people who are
bandwagon errs that come along and they
want to be your friend and they want to
latch on to you and they they just
whenever they see something going in a
good direction you know they want to be
part of that when it doesn't matter how
much popularity that you have as long as
you have some they want to be your
friend because they want to be part of
that they want to know what you got
maybe even though you even though you're
on top but I mean wait that's truth
though you know and today being a
reality internet celebrity is what
people want to be alright you see people
on Twitter and Facebook and their name
is almost famous and all types of shit
that has to do with being a celebrity
and when you're when we're put in
situations like this like on YouTube we
have no choice but to take what's given
to us I don't want to be don't forget
even in a celebrity and all in addition
but that's the time that we did because
when you become real popular that's what
you that's just what's given to you we
don't I can't think I want that that
would be something else right no it's
what you're giving that's just and you
take it we take it and we I reap the
benefits from it oh yeah but that's not
what I'm about and I'm not filling
myself or I don't feel like I'm better
than anybody I reply to messages I speak
to people when I'm on the street y'all
know I come up you know I say how low we
take pictures we laugh we giggle and all
that good shit I'll give you a dollar
whatever you need hey it works but
besides that I mind my business and to
be so very honest with you and to just
be so very blunt I'm not trying to be
friends with no other youtubers that's
just bottom line I we don't have an X P
Y hey I'm not a bitch we can speak I'm
an immigrant but I'm gonna be friend my
mom I don't worry friend that's it
that's it that's that goes for everybody
that's just not one person that's not
two people that's for everybody
I'm always been that type of person
where I keep people separate I keep my
friends close and my enemies so shits on
all of that yard that all goes in the
same buggy and I speak to you I'm closer
to you you're respectful to me I'm
respectful you do to you we speak and we
speak and that is what it is I don't
travel with these people I don't you
know when I'm gonna show you yeah I'm on
vacation I go with him I go with broken
I go with my other friends I that's what
we do I'm not like somebody people were
asking me was we going to sizzle in
Miami I believe or Atlanta I don't know
what to do I don't know but no and the
reason why I say no is we
every video anyway this all over that um
basically you know since we're the gays
go converse talk hump sex whatever works
for you um but I'm not a ten person I
don't like to be around a lot of gay
people at one point and especially when
there are events gay people tend to be
extra extra extra did it was pride
yeah and pride was it was a stretch for
both of us because usually we don't do
stuff like that but I did that because
people from that area we're like you and
see you and reach you and all that good
stuff so cool whatever but no it
actually durin says the will be on
vacation somewhere else but um happy for
you um yeah I mean stuff like that I
don't do that's just thing I don't do it
do you do they know he doesn't do that
about funny with the straight people
yeah I agree
I'm not I'm not - I'm gay myself true
but I'm here to a certain extent I'm the
gang straight person you ever meet if
that makes any sense you know I can have
you know it's just the extras is what I
don't like and you know I'm giving you a
lot of extra with the hands but yes I
can't do it that that's too much and
everybody is talking about fuckin
somebody T over here and it's trade over
here you know and it's bitches down over
here and it's I see them sort all they
NIT all these bitches in a life right
now I just I don't know bitch for my
mama gave me my life sign up to my mama

bitch he's not a bitch we're not rude I

get slick on Twitter no he can't be
but I'm gonna watch them work you just
I'm private with my life I don't speak
