give slightly motion talking about the
shame yeah yeah whoever they feel
terrible
like I got some really good soccer booty

granite ever again the fact that we
didn't help you together right now it's
all I'm
who not to be a blender and that's
better yeah I just look better okay not

woman is another but we do sure I see
ship in the back of the hand should

so with their concealer it's LA Colors
the concealer has very little you know
how to say empowering and it's not just
giving me a little bit of highlight but
they're in it like oh you know why
because this is foundation remember how
it is tarnish remember to be really not
no concealer but still fun to use Batman
alright just up just so good right right
where's my now see what happens
yeah nothing you guys use a corner part

actually very interested to see what do
that anyhow is going to be you know it's
the only one only one that they have
with Rose big wrong with base and in the
grossest fashion fandom gonna like are
you look at you
I'm is a really good play I was a veggie
it like can y'all tell look it kicked up
everything that I just all at work I
thought I put like four layers it's like
you might as well bar before because if
you botch to a time you want
I mean girl Apple going one more time
going to shake it up on both sides of
time and hopefully we can but it's not
like either this blend out at all for
one day happy brushes so if we weren't
using a brush this wind it'll be all
