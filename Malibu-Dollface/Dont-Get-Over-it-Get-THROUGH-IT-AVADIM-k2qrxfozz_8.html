felt like after the last couple of days
a lot of things are transpired that with
me I've been good I've been pretty good
people but um if you follow me on
Instagram mean guys know that I had did
a Instagram live about a situation with
another youtuber and you know people in
their life so what ended up happening
was with spark this is because the the
consensus of everything that had
happened in that situation came from the
fact that I said I feel like everybody
in this situation are hurt so we all
know the old saying hurt people hurt
people so it's one of those things where
I felt like we have a tendency to use
the term I'm over it but we really think
about what you're saying is saying I'm
over it means that this is the issue and
then you're here when you get through
something you go through the problem you
get to the meat and potatoes of the
issue so that's what this video is going
to be about to get through something as
opposed to get over something and I'm
gonna use myself in a lot of situations
because again I'm a human I grow I make
mistakes I've done things wrong peoples
army wrong most of the time so oh yeah
so you guys know that I spoke about a
situation with an ex that I'm no longer
who is and I know for some people they
were like you know I understand you know
that you guys are not going to be able
to be cool but why not give this person
at least the decency to you know kind of
explain themselves and for me there is
no point for you to explain what it
happened way back when my thing is this
when a person we do fall out with a
person never do the I'm talking about
you I'm going to law your business I'm
going to because that don't work okay if
you had an issue with somebody you're
best friends with somebody and you guys
sell out and the internet knew that you
guys were friends but you guys are no
longer friends
or you guys no longer speak like that
that's not the world's business to know
as to why you guys are not friends why I
don't see that's between you and that
person or whatever roof you guys are in
that was affected by that friendship not
being a part it's not the public
business so when people fall out today
it seems like everybody wants to go on a
smear campaign and then when somebody
says some about you you want to say
something back and the reason why you
want to say something back is because
you want to clear your name because you
know perception is a if
somebody perceives what another person
is saying about you to be true you want
to defend yourself be like that is not
me at all like that's not what her
person I am or at least not that I
thought I was you know there were
situations where I've fallen out with
people and I wish them well and I wish
them away but there's not one time that
you're going to hear me talking negative
about somebody that I used to be cool
with because I feel like if you were
ever cool with this person and you cared
about them you would not take your first
chance to dog them to the world and then
just run down the street with it and
then be okay with that action because I
feel like that action says that that's
how you feel about them the entire
friendship you know so if I care about
somebody or cared about somebody I can
tell my side of what I feel for the
platform that I have and what I choose
to do with it
if anybody's ever affected by something
that I say and I said and do then that
wasn't my point but maybe at that time
that was the only way for me to express
how I felt you know but what I'm not
going to do is say over around here no
more and it's something that I do a lot
is something I have to work on it's
something to have to understand it's
something that I need to get out of
things and the thing is what the issue
is is not how my processing I used to be
like that we'll just take a situation
and put it on the back burner and then
keep going again I'm I see that person
I'll be like I'm in that desk they're
like they say one thing it's just say
one thing
oh I will let it open heart grease on
you like that's how you feel so to get
out of ways I've just pretty much
processed it in my own time and process
into my own time requires me to just
simply take the situation forward face
value let it be what it is and then go
about my day from there because the
problem
when that in the issue with letting
things go into your psyche and then in
the back of your mind is that they can
be judged up and make you feel that way
when you see that person again because
there are unresolved issues there so you
have to stop saying them over it get
through it get to the point of the meat
of the the issue of whatever problem is
with you instead person so if I have an
issue with my homegirls I was cool with
way back in we don't who we ain't cool
no more i'ma let her know this is a
reason why don't with you no more
because you did a B and C okay and I
might be an XY and Z and know things
just ain't gonna go okay because the
middle part of that entire alphabet has
been so we cannot have the
meetings of the mind oh we're not going
to be cool so I won't say anything about
you don't say nothing about me
we can go about our day I wish you
nothing but the best whether you mean it
or not and if that's what you're trying
to go say it because eventually you're
going to get there but wish them well
wish them the best and wish them away
but what you have to start doing is
every time somebody does something that
you don't to much agree with or you
don't like people who have this very
subliminal way about themselves where
they want to get on social media and
they want to say certain things are
certain things pertain to them whether
being a song or quote I mean whatever it
all pertains to you as an individual but
the thing is and I've done it I am
guilty of doing this when something
pertains to my situation I'll be like
this let me tell you something if this
 ain't the truth but the problem
with that is a person that you may still
be following you you guys may still be
cordial and you may hurt somebody's
feelings in the midst of it and I get it
but like I said in the beginning this
video hurt people hurt people just
because you feel the way about a
situation doesn't mean you keep dragging
the person through the mud say your
piece about it tell them how you feel
about it and then move the on
because and every time there's an issue
and something comes up you keep getting
you keep pulling yourself back into
what's behind you and the problem with
doing things that from the past are
judging up things from the past is that
you can't see what's in front of you if
I keep doing this I think you see what's
in front of me so all these great things
that are coming towards you you're going
to miss them because of that reason it
is very hurtful when people do things to
you okay then a human reaction is to not
feel like somebody got the best of you
so you just say I'm strong I don't care
but you know what for people who matter
to you whether it be family friends as a
niskin other a bitch on the street a
taxi driver
uber driver a lift bitch I don't know
say yo you hurt my feelings
I don't think enough people do it's okay
to not be okay it's okay to not be
perfect it's okay to be in a situation
where you feel that you were blindsided
and disrespected by weight for whatever
cause your feelings cannot be disputed
you cannot tell the person that their
feelings are wrong okay just like a
doctor can't tell you that your burger
or don't hurt so you know it's one of
those things where nobody can argue with
that
which is I feel the way that I feel is
because this is what I feel is real and
then you go from there but if a person
is really your friend and they really
respect you and they really give a
about you they're going to listen to
what you're saying if they choose not to
then that means that your feelings don't
matter as much as it because people have
this woe is me syndrome which means when
the world and in their world when
is wrong they want the whole world
coming together like a Michael Jackson
 music video and everybody gets
together and we gonna do this and we
gonna heal the world and things are
going to be better but when it's anybody
else that isn't them they wants to say
it's not that deep
okay and that's for people who have a
lack of empathy for other people there's
a lot of things in the world that I've
never personally been through but I can
only empathize with somebody's situation
because of how bad I know how it feels
for other situations so that's where the
empathy car comes in it doesn't always
have to be you we just imagine if that
was you your mom your sister your
significant other your dog your foot
anything put yourself in someone else's
shoes see people don't like to do that
because what it requires is work and
people don't like to work these days
they want everything to be given to them
and let it be what it is because they
feel like they are better than like no
so stop trying to say I'm over it
 that get through the if
somebody hurts you as it was your model
this
so when you was 16 the visual daddy was
never there explain those things to them
because for me i'ma just I don't think
I've ever said this but me and my mother
are not close at all okay I love my mom
to death I just don't like her very much
okay she has a lot of growing that she
students to do as an individual and
throughout my life my father has been
incarcerated since I think like 94 so a
big bulk of my life a big all of my
life my father has been an absentee
father I speak about my grandparents a
lot here on my channel and I think
people are under the impression that my
grandmother my grandfather or my
mother's parents but they are not those
are my father's parents and I've closed
it to them than I am with my mom's side
of the family but the thing was when I
was a kid my mom was my primary
caretaker so her feelings about my
father
I pretty much manifest those for myself
so I like somebody that I really didn't
know you know the only thing I knew is
he was a gangbanger he got caught up in
some and now he's doing what
everybody else does dad in my class does
which is serving a whole shitload of
time for some stupid so what I did
was Neela mom had this really big
blowout and we you know that was I
haven't talked to her I think in like
two years
probably a little bit longer than that
now and after that what it did was it
put things in perspective it's like you
know when you think something is so bad
but then something else worse happens
and you were like that ain't too bad so
for me for a long time me and my dad
just didn't talk he any when I did speak
to him he never said anything negative
of a mom like ever my mom not so much
she had a lot to say but what I learned
from that situation is you have an issue
with someone that you don't even know
and you don't even want to give them a
chance because you are harboring
feelings that you haven't even expressed
him how you felt so I want to let me
just let you know that I don't hate you
I actually love you I thank you for my
grandparents you know you were not able
to do what you were supposed to do but
your parents you know I came from a
two-parent household my grandfather was
always around mark Graham
we'll give me the world I did whatever
my parents didn't do they picked up the
slack so I feel grateful for that as
opposed to saying what was me my parents
with young parents is you know the
they was doing for everybody they don't
have people like that you know in the
world was really now I love you mama be
like aren't American kids bitch please
so what it did was one I kind of got out
of my mom's own way of how she talked
about him I was able to give my own
relationship with him and that word fine
you know he wishes we have the birds and
he calls me asking how I'm doing is
never just how are you that's how it is
I'm very proud of who you become as a
person and that is what means the most
to me but for a long time I was upset
with a person that I needed know and he
saw his consensus which I kind of felt
too that he thought I hated him and I
can't really hate somebody that I don't
know you know so when I told him that
he's in Minnesota because what I didn't
want to happen was he leave this earth
and all these years we haven't spoken
had in a relationship he thought that is
his child hated him that wasn't the case
I was just taking on my moms and
Securities and issues and problems that
she had with him and putting them on my
shoulders and that doesn't work so I'm
able to have a relationship with
somebody that normally I probably would
not because I stepped out of being over
it and I got through it and we had a
conversation and a lot of things came on
that conversation that made things
better so understand that if there is a
resolved issue that shoot our people
that people have hurt you it is your
hurts have you have hurt people because
again second accountability for yourself
is a okay
it is aim of the good you sometimes have
to say I was wrong okay because no
matter what the situation is it's
something in it the breakup of a
friendship or relationship you probably
play a part in it may be a small part it
may be a big part but it's still apart
you know a lot of times you hear people
say he's crazy I didn't do anything
some the probably super one-and-a-half
percent times that's the truth but
I mean I was going on percent of the
time that's not the situation you
probably contributed when you didn't
know where you did something wrong or
you did you you
you didn't take somebody else's opinions
fillings into consideration and make
those away and then they react as to
whether they do again it's not an excuse
because every adult is responsible for
everything that they do you can't say
I'm going to smack the out of this
vision because I was mad because she
didn't listen to the fact that I said I
want two blueberry pancakes and not
regular that doesn't work but if you
accidentally can do something we all
have a tendency to be in our feelings
the other tendency to ignore other
people's feelings when yours are not
being met and that's okay to do but
understand that that action is going to
have a reaction and you don't want that
reaction to put you in a situation where
you guys are no longer even on talking
terms because a conversation could have
been had and it doesn't have to be a
relationship it could be anything so
remember that okay I just want to say
just cuz I wanted to kind of get this
off my chest I gotta get ready to go to
this party but I hope you guys have a
good day and again if you have an issues
or a fallout or just something in and
work with somebody or a situation and
you hold it in hardware and stuff let it
go but also we be able to repair it
because sometimes wood you have to
understand - before I go is that being
able to get through something doesn't
always involve the other party it has to
come for you don't try to get over it
because you want to seek to see you as
you're okay be okay for you so it's
genuine it's real it's not that I'm
faking the funk because that's the same
thing as saying I'm over it you're not
over it so don't act like and don't
under false front really be over it and
go through life and be the best you can
be for the next person in the next
situation the next job the next school
the next set of friends that you can be
for you and everything will fall into
place okay so I will catch on my next
one and I hope you guys enjoy this
he's sir</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
