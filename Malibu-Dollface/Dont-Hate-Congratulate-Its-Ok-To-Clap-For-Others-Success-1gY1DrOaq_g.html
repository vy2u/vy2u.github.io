don't hate congratulate so recently if
you guys already watched to review for
this hit well my last review for this
hair um then you guys know that I
recently had a photo shoot with her hair
company and I did it with three other
youtubers which was fabulosity is me ivy
and good Morgan and we had a great time
this is the first time I've ever met
Morgan inside Velocity's me but I met
you last year before she came out here I
think like March so um you know we you
know who having casual talk and all that
good stuff and one thing that stuck
stuck out to me was the fact that I was
genuinely happy to see other people
doing the same thing that I'm doing and
when you give them saying like I I me
personally no I'm not looking for
anybody else but me personally I enjoy
seeing other people be successful
whether we come from the same area the
same job whatever the situation is I
just genuinely like to see other people
living out their dreams and winning from
hard work and perseverance that a
miracle you names and and the vibe I got
when were all together with everybody
felt the same you know nobody was hating
nobody felt much hyper when we were all
laughing we're are joking you are acting
stupid we were all enjoying each other's
company
you know because quiet is kept most of
us as youtubers we don't have issues
with each other people have issues with
us liking each other
you know it's that thing it goes back
the same thing with Oh Beyonce don't
like he's told he's going on like
Michelle Michelle don't like salon just
launched it on like jay-z you know it's
just like behind this thing is you got
like I don't even know fur well ok you
know and in life I see a lot of people
do that they'll see someone get an
opportunity and the first thing they say
right why they asked that bitch and I'm
saying why is this bitch winning well I
can't I win and a bitch I'm better than
her I'm gonna tell me something
something that and one thing that you
y'all have to got to understand in order
to get like and really really enjoy is
that what's for one ain't
okay and what I mean by that is it's
someone else in successful that's their
blessing stop trying to steal their
shine do you guys know how many times
there is a youtuber or anybody that pops
up on any show I get tons of tweets and
Instagram messages that could have been
used that should've been you they should
have never used him and I'm like why
that's clearly if it was for me I would
have had if it was you know it was if it
was for me to go far and do that I would
be doing it but clearly my path is
different than theirs so I'm gonna lay
low mama Lord a Deshawn be happy for
them genuinely and go about my day
I don't listen I'll see Tyler Oakley on
the side of a hotel on Sunset Boulevard
and when I say on the side he is from
the top floor to the damn ground I
didn't do nothing but shout out to him
damn somebody's doing it shout out to
him there I don't have a reason to be
upset because there are a lot of people
who ain't doing yeah a lot more
folks ain't getting no opportunity and
you're mad because you're getting
opportunity but it's not theirs
you're truly reaching for something
that's not for you let them be if you're
in a job and I totally get being
frustrated because you're working so
hard but you're not seeing nothing come
from me you know saying or if you are
seeing something come from me it's not
what they're getting but you can't put
yourself you can't make up you can't
place yourself in a story that doesn't
involve you okay so if a person is
telling you about a story you can't tell
them how to store it is how it's gonna
end or how it should go
you think I'm gonna do it let people
live in and take your blessings no
matter how large or small they are take
them for what they are which are
blessings that means there's progression
going on in your life you're doing
something it ain't what they're doing
but you're doing something if you're
singer and you feel like this vision and
wise then you gotta work a little bit
harder pumpkin maybe it's not your time
do you think that I would be able to
enjoy the success that I have when I was
19 on here I don't think so
I'll because I was born in everybody I
wasn't mature enough to understand what
it was to have a professional button in
a non-professional but I don't think I
would have understood what it was to
have you know this company following me
or this celebrity wanting to kick it
with me or whatever the situation is I
don't know because at the time I don't
think I was ready for that now I can do
it and put on my professional hat and
being able to be able to go and say yo I
can do this I'm capable enough to do
this thank you for the blessing and an
opportunity you gave me with this and go
forward but some people want everything
to be so instant and hard work takes a
lot of time nobody got nowhere
overnight period that's just what it is
whether you're working a nine-to-five
job you working on your dreams you
working on your aspirations whatever
everything takes hard work and
you're gonna hear way more knows that
you will ever hear guesses that is just
the bottom line that's how life works
but that this is how it occurs you to be
better it hones you to wanna do more it
hones you to have dry because if
everything is given to you you don't
appreciate the when it comes it's
just the truth if somebody gave you
everything you're like this is why
people always say this about celebrity
kids or child actors they don't get what
it is to struggle and when they have to
struggle it's a culture shock because
they've never had to work for anything
you know not all of them Lord it was not
a child when ap kid they was playing the
child but they was not a jail um well
yeah you
you have to take you have to take your
journey for what it is it's called a
journey for a reason otherwise it would
be called a trip okay you take a trip to
the store you take a trip to the mall
you take a journey somewhere in a
journey takes time it's not an overnight
thing so stop expecting things that
happen so instant and then when they
don't or you see somebody else and you
got what why they pick her right I do
this but you don't know what her journey
is you don't know how long she has been
waiting for this and working for that
you don't know you know maybe that
Avenue is it for you and sometimes you
got to re-evaluate your dreams not all
the time most of the time what you feel
deep down inside of you is what you're
meant to do because you enjoy it you
love it it breeds creativity and fire
under you to want to do this but there
are people I look I look at all the time
who do to youtube videos and become
phenomenons
y'all know my journey like a lot of
other people was not like that it took a
long time for somebody like me to have a
position and have a lane because when I
started there was only one or two people
doing that you know now it's a whole
slew of others who are doing it but I'm
not mad at it you know I'm saying get it
how you live I'm not mad because what's
for me it's gonna be for me and what's
for you it's gonna be for you so it's
gonna be in a hater bitch if you see
somebody die thing you're saying like
that's not in your language does
something that's great again great
opportunity say you know what bitch
congratulations you did that I am happy
for you there no you know it won't hurt
to pay up somebody a compliment it
doesn't hurt to be happy for someone
post it if not look cute so it's not
acting like y'all gonna die because
somebody that you may not with like
that or somebody that you don't know
like that has done then she
bitch gotta eat too you know we gotta do
something
let her do it well yeah thank y'all for
