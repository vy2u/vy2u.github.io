we're gonna have a nice little
discussion because I'm quite over the
fucker read that is the Internet as of
right now so most of you guys have heard
that Bruce has transitioned into Caitlyn
Jenner and I think that it's an amazing
transition I think that it's needed for
the LGBT community and I also believe
that there's a lot of ignorant people
still in this world so the reason why I
decided to do this video because you
guys usually know when things come up in
the media I usually stand clear and
don't say much I used to be like you
know these are my personal feelings I'm
gonna let them be what it is but it's
just so much bullshit that has been on
the internet since this has come about I
have to say something because it's
necessary first and foremost um I think
that is very courageous it's very brave
and it's very respected that a person
who has been living a lie and their life
to accommodate other people for 65 years
have now taken reigns of their own life
and did what the fuck they want to do
and a lot of judgmental motherfuckers
who are out there to have comments about
this or the reason why your ass still
living in a closet the reason why your
motherfucking ass is in my DM telling me
not to tell your baby momma about what
we're talking about that's the type of
mother fucker I'm talking about so the
first thing that really got on my nerves
was this picture we're gonna put this
here and it is a picture of Michael
Jackson and it says and I quote y'all
judged him or ridiculed him for this but
he is which it should have been a she
it's brave for doing this this that in
third let me explain the difference
between the two because that's like
comparing apples and oranges okay and
it's getting ridiculous
Michael Jackson was a youth who was
brought up in the industry okay he did
he was forced to do a lot of things as a
child that he did not want to do he grew
to become one of the best entertainers
and I we probably will ever see in our
life he had a complex not about
necessarily being black but be related
to his father he had an issue with Joe
Jackson he had an issue with being
attached to that name so
feeling like that was him he decide he
wants to be Peter Pan and you put a wig
on Peter Pan Peter Pan is gonna look
like a woman okay let's just make that
very simple Peter Pan's gonna look like
a woman so he decided to go down this
round later and Michael's life Michael
started to resemble a Caucasian lady
Bruce Jenner now Caitlyn Jenner decides
that at 65 I want to make a transition
from the person that I used to be into
the person that I am okay so there is a
difference okay that's a big difference
but a lot of people that I've seen
reposting this particular mean have been
people of the african-american community
but if I'm not mistaken the people that
ridicule Michael and have such issues
with him and not want to be black were
black people so why are you mad down why
are you so gung ho from my fucking
Michael now he's not here
don't throw him miss roses when he's not
here okay you should have did that why
he was fucking here so I don't have time
to sit here and listen to motherfuckers
with sour mouths don't want to sit on
Facebook because he want likes about
what he feels about Bruce versus Mike so
it was another motherfucker he wants to
start comparing well y'all talked about
the Kardashians because Kim got her ass
done and Kylie got her lips done but
shotgun said what Bruce is do it is not
the same thing okay
Kylie did bad for vanity reasons Kim did
that for vanity reasons she did this
because she wanted to be who she really
was there is a difference okay so I'm a
bitch go out here and get a procedure
because she wants to look cuter for
someone else other did herself or for
herself that's not the same as the
person switching genders and being who
they feel like who they are on the
inside on the outside there's a big
difference people come to me and say the
most ridiculous things you can think
about me you want to be a warm man you
want to be this and you want let me let
me just expand this usually comes from
women this is you it fairly rarely comes
from men because most men don't have
enough intellect to say something of
that magnitude so they'll just you know
start with the foil it I'm a fag I'm
nice I'll be just like you know it's
cool yeah
know that you like me on the low but
it's cool um but with the women the
thing is people like myself for
androgynous I like your clothes your
clothes is nice and it's not my fault
and please women don't take that fuck
with me don't take this offensively but
it's not my fault that I can rock your
shit better than you that's not my issue
that's not my problem okay that's
something that as a woman this you
should be hardwired to do and I can do
this better than you that's the issue
that you need to take what your self
with you usually that's where the
problem comes in you see competition
from not only another person but you see
it from a person that's not even the
same gender as you I've never in my life
wanted to be a woman okay cuz trust me
if I really wanted that ladies my shit
would definitely be a beautiful pink
pussy and my shit will be tighter than
the walls of yours could ever be for the
bitches who have something to say okay
so trust me if that's the lane that I
wanted to go down I would have been done
it but that's not who I am as a person I
dress like this and I also go down the
street like this it depends on how the
fuck I feel in the day the problem with
society today and I did a video on this
it's about the double standard a man
cannot go down the street like this
because this is not acceptable our girl
came dressed just like a boy and she's
called a tomboy there's a difference I
could give a fuck about what another
person says about me and what the fuck I
should do with myself you don't pay my
bills you don't do anything for me and
the main people who are judging Caitlyn
and other people like Laverne Cox who
are transgender orders very same people
who are not living in their truth listen
I don't give a fuck what you do as long
as you are living who you are you're not
hurting anybody do what the fuck you
want to do if you want to just like a
banana but a tomato or M&amp;amp;M that's your
motherfucking business that's your
prerogative to do so this is your life
and I am NOT no God and I don't have no
heaven or no Hill to put you in or how
the fuck you feel but there are
motherfuckers out here well you know
being gay is this and then a Bible that
says this and you're not supposed to do
this and you're not supposed to do this
so the other day there was a young lady
and I'm a card I'm using that work very
motherfucking freely right now there was
a young lady who decided she wanted to
say that very bullshit to me and usually
I try not to require
back but I was having a good day and
then something pissed me off so I was
you know my day was kind of fucked up
okay so says she want to say something
so this this young lady was a little bit
heavier okay and I'm saying it's for a
reason wait to her page
she got McDonald's she attempted to get
some subway she was eating candy I said
you know there's so many ways I could go
with this listen she wanted to bring in
the Bible because she believes so much
in it while she's talking to another
girl's man that she was arguing with but
okay um I said you know for you to say
that to me I understand where you're
coming from because you read your Bible
on a regular don't you young lady
well you know gluttony is a sin as well
okay and you look like you're about 20
pounds overweight where you shouldn't be
so if we're going to hell for sinning I
hope you have a motherfucking seat right
next to me because I'm a motherfucking
get on your nerves until we both ride
how about that since you just older
since you start golly don't try to play
God when it's good for you and the
opportunities of what you're trying to
do but when will you do it it was a
mistake you were pinched of sin and
you're fine but someone else do it
they're going to hell life doesn't work
like that little pussycat could you pick
up that book whenever the fuck you feel
like you doing something bitch don't try
me cuz I know the good book better than
I have a lot of you bitches who out here
giving selective situations okay and
this usually comes from the bitch you
got three baby daddies throw
motherfucking kids been married twice
currently is engaged and with another
woman's man when she's trying to marry
bitch I'm not the one
trust me I'm a lot of motherfucking
things but what I'm not gonna do is I'm
not gonna sit up here and be a punk
bitch because you feel like you can sit
up here and Punk me with the words of
the Bible because you feel good about
your shit these bitches out here fucking
and sucking on married man their
motherfuckers out who are fucking his
brother's wife they got cousins and
brothers and shit like that it happened
in the Jacksons so I mean don't come and
want to be selective about the sins that
you put out there when you want to sit
up there and talk about somebody and if
you guys should understand this if you
are happy with and who the fuck you are
then do you don't worry about what the
next bitch is doing
I salute people who live in their truth
whatever the
fuck the truth maybe there are so many
bitches out here living lies and then
they want to sit up here and try to get
the acceptance from bitches who don't
motherfucking matter then you have miss
Peter Thomas yes miss Liu Peter bitch
from the Real Housewives of Atlanta look
before I get here can I just say Caitlin
came through snatch wigs edges in all
that from Chris and all the rest of the
motherfucking Kardashian's and went
about her motherfucking day right back
to Malibu so right only you sister do
what the fuck you want to do so Peter
decides he wants to put his little two
cents on you I'm not being a hater but
really you're gonna put this on you
gonna put him on the cover is just
something so I took it as if he's saying
it feels away because his wife Cynthia
is a woman of color and this particular
magazine does not put a lot of
african-americans on their cover I
understand that but this is not a race
issue and this is another thing that I
have predominantly with the
african-american community people want
to make everything about fucking race
and i'ma say this and whoever gets mad
you gonna just fucking be mad okay I am
black I am gay I have walked through
Beverly Hills with a hoodie on and a
motherfucking beanie minding my own
fucking business
the cops have ruled by several different
and no one has ever fucked with me no
one cuz I mind my fucking business and I
didn't go out there looking like I was
gonna do something and I'm not saying
that every per every african-american
man who's been through something or has
been shot down has been doing something
wrong but I know my limitations and I
know where I come from and I know what
the fuck I look like so I'm not gonna
put myself in harm's way to believe that
I'm invincible because I feel in my
heart that I should be able to do what
the fuck I wanna do that is what I'm
saying I know that I can't go to certain
areas I know what type of person that I
am I know that if I do this this is
going to be the fucking repercussion so
don't put yourself in a situation and
they get mad when this is the outcome
okay every motherfucking body in the
world is not racist every white person
does not hate black people every black
person doesn't hate white people
okay understand that be
be very honest with you a bulk of the
motherfuckers that have helped me in my
life have been non african-american with
nothing to gain from helping me a little
black boy from the hood so sometimes you
have to reevaluate why certain things
are happening to you or you the cause of
it are you the reason the woman who
whupped her son's ass on national TV for
having his stupid ass out there fucking
riding about her mother fucking cause he
didn't even know much about is what you
mother should be doing y'all kids didn't
my motherfucking in boxes in my
motherfucking comments calling me all on
my name so this one little girl decides
she wants to be molded her mother
fucking calling me on my name I read
that little bitch fulfills her mother
gonna say you need your ass before
talking to my daughter I said you and
your daughter need they ass whooped for
talking to me like that
I don't know neither wanted you not be
head of bitches but she brought it
alright bitch I brought that shit right
back so understand whether it's Caitlyn
or anybody else in the world you do not
judge somebody for the choices that they
make in their life are you living by the
Good Book bitch are you doing what the
fuck you supposed to do as a person as a
Christian as a citizen are you doing
that are you just sitting here doing
with everybody you just spewing this
bullshit because everybody else is doing
it right is that what is that what we're
doing we're still playing follow the
leader
somebody told me just a long time ago
and it will never leave my mind when you
as you grow up there are gonna be people
who tell you to do you and live your
life and they're gonna turn around and
judge you for just what they told you to
do okay so no matter what you do in life
whether you were the perfect Christian
or you as a sinner there's gonna be
somebody who's got something to say so
instead of trying to conform to what
these Oh finally some other fuckers got
to say fuck them life is yours do what
the fuck makes you feel good as long as
you are not hurting anybody else in the
fucking process okay
oh you motherfuckers out here who want
to sit up there and judge Caitlyn the
Kardashians or whoever oh no what she
did this for attention because you know
this part
Chin's are known for telling their
business okay and you're known for
listening bitch so your point is what
Kim wouldn't be who she was if it wasn't
people like you all in a motherfucking
business she tried to be in her lonesome
in Malibu at her house and then there's
pictures of her in the sundress that
popped up from a fucking long angle lens
of her just trying to do her so if
people want to know so bad I'm gonna
show you and why not make a buck out of
it I would too wouldn't you
he should be worried about what kylie is
doing where's your momma knowing what
the fuck you was doing at 17 all the
merry man you was fucking do she know
about that hell no the only difference
between that and her is that she got
money and your ass don't that's the only
difference so I'm trying to act like you
as a stand-up six seventeen sixteen
eighteen year old cuz you wasn't so shut
your ass up let her do her and let her
parents parent her okay that's the
problem
everybody got kids when a parent
everybody else kids your motherfucking
child Ben and why a since he was
motherfucking 13 why you ain't worried
about what the fuck he doing hmm right
cuz you to worry about what the fuckin
Kardashians is doing that's your problem
motherfuckers are not of mind they own
motherfucking business Bruce
Caitlyn and none of your concern and I
want to know for the life of me why is
this such a big discussion among men hmm
why do you care about what a transgender
person is do this should be out of your
psyche this is fun this is the gay
community's issue okay
this is one of ours and before I go I
want to just reiterate this because I
think a lot of people don't understand
what I'm about to say your sexual
preference versus your gender or not the
same thing because if it was then there
won't be a lot of less straight people
in the world there are a lot of
bisexuals there are a lot of women who
like women that doesn't mean if she want
to be a man that means that she's a
woman who likes a woman so understand
because the person is transsexual does
not mean that they want to now sleep
with the opposite sex that's not the
same there's no
or because now Kaitlynn is identifying
as a woman that she wants to go now and
sleep with men that's not the same thing
and before you come through educate
yourself on the the calls and the
subject matter at hand because there's a
lot of research for a lot of you
ignorant motherfuckers to do ignorance
is something that can be changed that is
a choice being stupid now see a lot of
young motherfuckers is born with that
shit so I'm gonna go on that note but
just take what I said take heed to that
okay it's not your business to worry
about what another motherfucker is doing
you need to take care of you
y'all got a lot of other motherfucking
problems and Caitlyn Jenner should not
be one of them
he got bitches like Steve Harvey the
biggest clown around talking about some
you know they said he's bright for doing
this but I could never come home and say
this to my wife let me tell you
something
there was a situation happened to me
when I was like around 12 where I was by
the courts I had to go to therapy
because they were afraid that what
happened to me and it was not sexual for
yahoo but to say it was not that it was
something else um but they thought that
I would have a hard time in life if I
didn't go to therapy I went to therapy
and it made me such a better person I
think that's why I can do this and say
this now from the standpoint the problem
with the african-american community
especially when it comes to
homosexuality or anything that is not
what you are born into is a fucking
problem it's an issue you don't want to
talk to talk about it our business is
not for the world that's that's why we
killing each other because ain't nobody
letting out they angry everybody want to
pop each other in a motherfucking mouth
when they connect instead of talking
about what the fuck is the problem
that's the problem
okay you are the problem I don't think
people fucking get what the issue is
that's why they're predominantly a lot
of DL men or african-american men
because they have suppressed their
desire to be who the fuck they are
because of the community that they come
from okay that's why one girl be like oh
you want to be a chick you want to
listen honey girlfriend okay sister girl
yes your man likes me just the way that
I am pretty in the face and nice in the
pants
that's what they like okay
so before you speak that way trust me I
have something that you don't and you
have something that I don't so there's
two that I can offer him that you cannot
okay so don't say it like you have a
one-up on me somehow because there is
somebody for everybody okay in the main
bitches who like to talk to most shit
are the main ones whose man is creeping
in my DMS trust me okay
you have to be responsible for the image
that you put out and you portray to the
public okay don't be out here like a
fucking dumb bigot because you feel how
you feel and you think your feelings are
correct honey your feelings are your
feelings they're not facts so stop
spewing him like it's the God's honest
truth because it's not what he's doing
is wrong and it goes against God's Word
because God doesn't make mistakes in it
if this is the case and he's trying to
fix God's problem listen I'm not there
I'm not a big religious person
especially with Christianity because
Christianity to me is more so like a
cult than it is a religion a religion
would be I would tell you it would be
spirituality I'm a spiritual person I
speak to God in a higher power all the
time and he's the reason why I am here
so therefore I don't have to sit in a
church house to get the world from a
whole bunch of people who turned up on
Saturday and then here Sunday because
they want they shit to be okay they want
to feel like they're gonna repent they
sell so they can get into heaven that's
not how things work but that's a hot a
lot of y'all act and that's the problem
I think that everything is done for a
reason and I agree with that statement
God does not make mistakes so in with
that being said katelynn Laverne Cox and
everyone from the LGBT community to me
as an example of what is supposed to
happen
Caitlyn was going through her journey to
become who she is now she went from
Bruce to Caitlyn the lack of respect for
a limpid gold medalist to me is crazy
because they're out here free Tinky
freed yzma and did you know this nigga
did something he is on camera
killing somebody you still yelling for
him good okay they just want to buy her
own motherfucking business and that
there is a fucking problem
so that's the thing that I understand
maybe Caitlyn's journey is a vessel for
other people because what this is gonna
do is you bigots and you dumb
motherfuckers who want to sit back and
speak ignorant shit this is gonna allow
your child one day who may be like
Caitlyn to walk down this street and not
be as judged as yesteryear so respect it
you don't have to agree with it but be
respectful because I'm sure there's a
lot of shit in your closet that we can
dig the fuck out that you don't want the
world to know and yo ask any woman or
man enough to come out and actually say
that shit and living your truth it's a
lot of cowards living in closets okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
