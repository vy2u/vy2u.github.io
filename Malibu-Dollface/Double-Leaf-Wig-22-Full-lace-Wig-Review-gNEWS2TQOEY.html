good morning mark but you had a love
life
hello okay so I didn't plan this but you
guys know I like to change on my
backgrounds like after so many videos
and I'll go but you know I'll do
something new so I tried blue have this
nice cute little one piece on and you
know I got my favorite you guys know I
live for thigh part and these earrings
and all of a sudden I'm starting getting
flashes of rock the boat
that's word that's what I'm getting
right now just I just wanna baby a
little screw screw now you guys know
it's been quite a while since I've had
the opportunity like every now and then
I'll get the opportunity to just do a
wig a wig that didn't make a full lace
wig from a company and oh I missed this
once I finished all my reviews I'm going
back to nothing but strictly lace wigs
I'm so over WestEd here but we'll get to
that later this is from a company called
a whole leaf wig I believe that's what
it says the calligraphy on this box is a
is quite but it is it's kind of
different
so I almost I'm assuming that's what it
says so they asked me you know are you
interested in doing a review and I
believe at the time they were trying to
get me to do worth it here and I was
like I'm not I can't take any more
reviews right now for within here it's
just too time-consuming I can only do
weeks right now because wigs are so much
easier they're easier to test they're
easier to put on there is just kind of
like a foolproof way of reviewing where
I don't have to do all of this extra
work and maintenance so you guys know
that I love a good full lace wig I love
my frontals I really do but I ain't
nothing like deuce so to the wig okay so
this has my information on it so it says
I have a full lace wig it's 22 inches
it's a small cap which I should have got
because I'm so used to gluing my wigs
down now I should have got a medium and
I'm small um in my lace is a light brown
so all of their usual things that
happens you get it in the Box they sent
you a lunch lady there
between you guys no but what was random
they send me a pack of napkins which I
just I will use but I just don't know
what the I don't know what they're
trying to say here I don't know if this
was a mistake I don't know if somebody
was under lunch and decided to do a
little extra overtime I don't know but I
don't know what the point of the napkins
was but a double leaf wait can you let
me know what these I'm using them I just
want to show y'all before I use them
okay so we're going to get to the things
that I dislike first okay one of the
things that I dislike is this this way
came with no combs not one so legit I
just like there are no combs for me to
put this in whatsoever so I had to go
back to kind of my old method kind of
which is putting it behind my hairline
hence my kid over here but it is glued
down for sure I just have it behind my
hairline blew down it is supposed to
being in front and the reason why I get
to do that is because after I put it on
and I flat ironed it when I first got it
it was just straight you know this is
the natural texture of it it was
straight because they sent me the wig
and the wig wasn't as full as I would
have liked it I went ahead and sold some
tracks I put about four tracks in the
back just so it could have a more of a
fuller feel to it because I just feel
like like this right here for the
average person is great this is fun I
can rock with this you know this is fine
I could rock with this density it was a
little bit thinner when I got it so what
I decided to do is you know I just took
my good old needle and thread I found a
couple of tracks that I had laying
around and I just sold them in the back
when I did that it made the cap smaller
so because yeah it just made the cap
smaller because you you're pulling and
the whole thing so I wasn't able to
place there right on my hairline like I
would have liked had I got a medium cap
then which I'm gonna start requesting
once I start reviewing just wigs again
just all medium cap so if I don't like
the density or whatever I can still wear
the wig is just not a thin wig that I
don't like now by no means was this like
super crazy thing it had a nice little
fullness to it but I guys know I'm a G
with the lace wig game so I've a lot of
combs
a lot of gone and I just feel like this
was just needed a little bit of more of
a um in order for me to get a little bit
more body because I didn't and I did not
cut any layers into it so not cutting
any layers into it leaves the hair very
flat and once it's very flat and it has
no body or in her life to it and it just
looks ridiculously sleep thin um I
wouldn't personally put a curl in it it
does however her hold a curl I have went
ahead and curled a little bit of the top
when I first got it and I curled some of
the bottoms to just give it more like a
wavy look just see how long it would
last so I did that and then put it on a
mannequin head and let it sit for about
three days and for the most part and I
every day I would you know browse
through the kitchen and just run my
fingers to it to see if they would fall
and for the most part it kept weirdly it
kept its curl being that the fact that
the hair usually the thinner it is the
list of a curl it will hold but didn't
do that so that was a great thing about
it just was wish it was a little bit
full this week did not come with the
density on the tag at all so I don't
know if this is there 100% density which
I would just go ahead and assume it is
but I don't know this is there 100%
density however if it is then maybe we
should up it to 150 because the wig
itself is great the lace great the just
even though the hairline even though I
plucked it it still wasn't as full and
Barbie in like edged up is what I'm used
to getting with lace wigs that I
reviewed in the past now you guys know
as of recently a lot of companies
especially in China are kind of catching
on to the fact that we send things out
pre plucked is easier and the customer
will be a little bit more happier
because you know it's just we don't have
to worry about all of this stuff that we
have to do once we receive it so that's
the great thing about it so I think they
kind of taken that into consideration
with their wigs as well which i think is
great the actual shedding that I have
experienced with this wig has been
absolutely positively none which that's
another reason why
love lace wigs because it's very rarely
there kind of get a wig that's going to
 like crazy and if you do please
send a book but I have not at all uh
received you know any shedding with this
particular hair at all and the hair that
I use to sew into this is the same 22
inches that the wig is so everything is
still blunt at the bottom for the most
part everything is still well it's not
crazy blunt but it could be but this is
definitely a very I'll turn around is a
very very good natural option for
somebody who just wants you know a nice
wig that's not crazy because you're
going to be in the heat or you're going
to be playing with kids or you know
whatever your your job description or
your hobby is this one would be great
even for me if I was to go which I will
be going to I believe on the 19th it is
this year but they have gay night every
year here in California at Six Flags and
are we going and I'm probably going to
wear a wave like this or something
similar to it with the lynching the
density is quite low because you're on
rides you're on and off stuff you're
running yeah I'm saying you're it's just
a lot and you don't want to have like I
would never wear a wig that has five
bundles into it to anything that will
require me to be very active because
then there it gives a problem so double
leaf wigs I give y'all a nice eight and
a half because um y'all Witter got a
nice tan has this density been pop you
know because it just take a bit more
time for me to have to sew wigs into I
mean so tracks into my wig to make it as
full as out like it but um yeah it only
came with an adjustable strap in the
back he didn't come with any combs in it
and normally I cut combs out but I do
like to have that option because
everybody doesn't glue like if I'm gonna
glue the arm like gots to be glue the
front down then I would rather not have
any combs because it's not gonna let his
flight as I want to but if I wanted to
just kind of put it behind hairline I
kind of just sit it and don't go
anything then of course I would need
that extra security and in order to have
that with this I'll have to go ahead and
put a thicker strap because the
adjustable strap on it it only and this
is not just this week as always it only
is going to do so much to keep it secure
if you don't have anything glue down in
the front so let me know what you guys
think this is very very reminiscent of
like what I was wearing when I first
started before the colors before all of
the extra news I was wearing my hair
like this for the most part so I do hope
you guys enjoyed this and I know
somebody's going to ask that has not
watched but the winners of my giveaway
have already been announced in a
previous video so congratulations to
them and I will catch you in my next
pair</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
