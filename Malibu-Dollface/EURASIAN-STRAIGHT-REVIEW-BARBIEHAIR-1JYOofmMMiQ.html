someone all right guys so I know this
looks very different than what I'm used
to and you guys are accustomed to when
it comes to my hair um but I told you
guys this year I just wanted to try a
whole bunch of stuff that was different
and I was new and this is no different
so this Barbie here that I'm rocking
hence my Barbie jacket it's from her
hair company so not too long ago I have
mentioned to you guys that I had went um
to do an actual photo shoot with her
hair company and this is the hair that I
wore to that particular photo shoot and
I've had this hair ever since so I can't
remember even what month that was so you
have to go find one of those videos to
pretty much figure out what month it was
when I went out there but um I will send
his hair because um all of us had
different looks I think Ivy had curly
hair Morgan had curly hair I have
straight blonde hair and fabulosity is
me had straight black hair so um during
that photo shoot I was a little I'm not
gonna say mad but I was just like I
didn't know that I was gonna be the only
person with color but the photos came
out great and I am SuperDuper in love
with this hair because this hair is been
popping ever since and let me tell y'all
I don't know where blonde hair often I
only usually wear it if I'm reviewing it
or I'm having a blond Ambition moment
and best use the other time I'll
actually be blonde otherwise you guys
know I mean so usually my darker colored
hair I'm not really into the 613 like
that but I do love this um and the
reason why I love it is because after
all these months my hair is still white
whoa still blonde and it's still soft
and it's still bouncy and it still holds
a curl so I'll get into this
to this real quick I'm not for sure
about these fixes I've had this error
for a minute but I believe I have in a
20 or 22 or 24 and I think a 28 and 26
I'm not sure because my longest bundle I
believe is 28 cuz this hair is really
long and it's curled so I feel like my
longest would have been 28 I'm not sure
or maybe the hair just runs a little bit
longer
again this was been a minute since I've
had this hair and I've been wearing it
pretty much on and off um I wore when I
did scream queens which um when I did
scream queens for my web series I wore
my web sort I wore one week for a
particular scene that was electro just a
regular lace wig and then when I
received this hair and I had a finished
shooting um
the stuff that I put on Instagram that
stuff was in this particular way except
it was straight and I had like a beret
on to really can't tell you know it just
looked all blonde this hair and washed
very nicely I remember I got some color
in it because originally I was sent a
closure and my closure was white it was
still blonde had no black roots in it so
I had to color the roots the day of the
shoot I believe I had colored the roots
because I had came back from New York
and I was just so it was so much that I
was doing within that little amount of
time I wasn't able to really do what I
wanted to do but once I did it um I
ended up doing the shoot and then the
roots that I did on it was I use like
one of those root touch-ups and it was
like this much black probably about that
much black and then I went back and um I
was actually had a frontal and this is
before I even started messing around
frontals like that I actually had a
frontal that I really liked and I took
my closure out and I had tore that cap
somehow doing something god-knows-what
so I redid the entire wig and then I
ended up just pretty much I took the
frontal that I had which had the same
like roots that was going on which is
this one going and I just took it and
I'll just make the roots a little more
black and I made them a little longer so
they can be like this versus the roots
that I had originally as you guys can
see in this photo my roots were about
two inches so as you guys can see my
roots are a little bit longer now than
they were which I prefer because I want
you to be able to see the dark through
it because sometimes because my real
hair obviously my hair is black I want
to feel like everything underneath here
is black and then it grew out in his
blonde but I accidentally got some of
the black color which was my original
point on this hair and I was actually
able to lift it off um when I soaked it
in some very very cold water and it
actually ended up coming up and I'd have
to like read bleach that particular part
it's still a little bit darker but it
did come off but this hair is really
really nice it's really soft it's really
pretty the tones all the tones are
correct you know sometimes you get
blonde hair and it'd be like a little on
a brassy side but you see I have like
the different tones in it like this is
lighter this is a little bit darker this
is still lighter and the curls
definitely don't they do help to show
the dimension that's in the hair as well
this particular frontal I did not pluck
I'm going through but I just haven't got
around to it and I just kind of wanted
to see how we can make it work before I
flip it and so far I think it's good but
I think a plucking will definitely uh
erase the bar of this to where it needs
to be ah the closure that they sent me
was really really nice I just wish that
I did have the dark roots that I wanted
and I get it it was a very hectic time
for the both of us nothing that I
couldn't do it just that I wasn't really
I thought I was gonna be able to do it
or whatever so yeah for the shoot I wore
the closure that they provided for me
and it was colored which would be this
these particular photos here and then I
went ahead and switched over to this
nice little frontal to kind of give it
the dimensions I feel like I'm giving
you
nene leakes right now which I'm not
happy about cuz you know uh what is the
net though my hair's been holding up
great and this color will take I wanna
die this hair so bad like I love blind
you guys know I love my girl Barbie ah
that's why were just good on jacket
because you know she has this nice big
fluffy blonde hair um but I just I want
to go some color in it so bad and I want
it to be like a blue color or something
like that but I do like myself in this
color I think it works for my tone very
well I think that the thickness of it I
like the fact they sent me a lot of
bundles because I feel like especially
with blonde like you don't got enough
black bundles that's one thing but
blonde if it will show so bad if you get
three bundles and you want this much
hair cuz it's got to look crazy is you
needed to be looking full and it looked
nice because otherwise she's going to
look crazy so if you guys have any more
questions about this hair that I'm
rocking right here make sure you guys
i'll put it below I'll put the link to
this hair and the description bar and my
closure I'll put that also in our
description bar you can use any 6:13
frontal that you want of your liking if
you want to color it cool but yeah I'm
I'm filling this Barbie hair for real
cuz this is really pretty
and it's nice and again I told y'all it
flows it's killing pretty and you know I
had thought little layers in it give a
little height you know little drama so
again my hair's from her hair company of
course check the links below and I would
catch y'all in my next face also don't
forget to visit her ear company.com

year anniversary sale with bundles deals
