feel like I just robbed somebody's
husband of all he's a little dope all
right mm-hmm
you know it's good when I got a vocal to
go with it so I'm here to do a review
for allure I mean at least that's how
Google Holmes said that is a Hitler it's
alien so they contacted me and asked me
did I want to do a review and I said
sure and I said what I've only taken
this is like the start of my only wigs I
still got a lot of what they're here but
this is one of those and um there tell
me the wig so the way came with just
this and you know I get a lot of
eyelashes with China companies but the
thing is that I lied should be sold like
the baby yeah like I can't wear those I
like to see perfectly but I appreciate
it very much so so to the wig this is
their 20 inch lace front wigs so
therefore from here to here is all of
the parting that I have available for
this okay so this will pretty much give
you a typical 13 by for frontal activity
that's kind of what this is given so you
guys know I love my executive realness
look so I decided to go ahead and
recreate that because I've got me a new
jacket off ebay girl you love
my ebay first girl they shared like
mothballs but they cute in the moment
they cute for the club so how do I feel
about this here well I got a few
hang-ups about it that I'm not crazy
about but overall I will say right now I
give them a nine because their hair that
they sent me was not advertised as
anything but what it was so like I said
this is a lace front unit when I receive
the unit it did not have all of this
baby hair realness here in the front
someone sent me a picture of Keisha K or
on snapchat I said is there any possible
way that you could do this look so I
said this would be the perfect time
because with lace fronts is very light
this is the party for the middle but you
know how frontals or lace front wigs
work is that they taper off on the side
for the ear tabs so it gets shorter on
the side so as my part is only this in
the middle imagine what it looked like
on the side so I was like I'm not gonna
be able to do anything with this besides
this whole look so I know this is their
this is their Brazilian body wave unit
it is sad it's pre plucked um it was
pretty flex when I got it but it wasn't
this pre-flood I definitely went back
and did a whole lot more play so it was
pretty floods and it was a body wave
when I got it I didn't like it because
of the density it says it's 130 this
gives me more of a 90 density a hundred
density this definitely doesn't give me
130 okay girl I've been in the hair game
for a minute and we all know that that
is not 130 so I don't so I'm not really
sure about as far as what scale that
they're um you know they're doing this
on not really sure but I'm not getting
130 so there is three inches of parting
space here it pokes out a little bit
here in the middle and then it tapers
off on the side and this 13 in the front
so it's pretty much 13 by 3 so well it's
12 by 3 it is elastic cap in the back so
there are tracks back here there is a
actual column here in the back you'll
see all of the calf construction on the
actual link that is down below if you
want
get a more in-depth look about how the
cap is constructed imma probably change
I have no problem with a tangling or any
type of any of that however I'm not
crazy about it because of the fact that
I looked on their site and they do not
offer regular wigs they only sell lace
front wigs now listen girl no shades or
nobody else but oh here's the world lace
front wigs like girl this is real 2012
like we because the thing is this would
be very cute if I could do like a really
low-key bun back here you know that like
a really low bun with a really thick um
like a cuff that would have been cute
but because the hair isn't is um sick
one I can't do that in two there isn't
actually like actual tab back there so
there's no lace in the back so even with
a 360 frontal I would able to be able to
put this in a ponytail and quite frankly
because it is not as full our ponytail
like this that's really sleek and low
would have been fine with me but because
I don't have that option what are you to
do um I like my parts really long you
guys know like my parts into the back of
my head so I already knew part eNOS was
just not gonna be a thing anything that
require your body of any sort I knew I
wasn't gonna be able to do this hair is
good for this look which is pretty much
just to the point very slick very flat
very bad now I will say this though okay
I will say this before I say that let me
just get back so that's 130 density is
what I said
it is Brazilian body waves and they also
give you other links that will be down
below for their Indian hair as well as
their Indian closures so I'll say this I
clicked on this to see how much this wig
was for those who are asking for a
10-inch wig that's just like this will
be 7609 okay now if you want 24 inches
the most you'll pay for this wig is 150
803 okay okay
now 150 803 is actually less than money
than you would pay for a frontal even a
13 by 4 frontal these days so the fact
that they're giving you our entire wig
even though their tracks in the back is
an amazing deal ok I'm
I'm being honest with you now a 20 inch
wig 13150 16 103 68 12 inch 82 78 so
again if you're a person who is just
looking for a quick way to trying to
figure out how this thing this weight
thing works this is actually cheaper
than most of the beginner-friendly bike
wigs because at least this way you don't
break the bank
I know from schools that run up to two
hundred and something dollars trust me I
just brought him one of my own money so
even though what's a 13-6 stay over I
was like 227 so for the price of what
they're charging I feel like it's
comparable for what you're getting if
this was a hundred dollars more I would
say absolutely not but because they're
so affordable I would go with it if
you're just looking for a lace front wig
that you can throw out one pop one go
for work or do you just want something
that's more of the sleeker side you're
just trying to learn how this whole
weight thing works all of that I would
mess with them they were extremely
polite with me they were understanding
they understand everything that I was
trying to do and get through so from
like I said a 1 to 10 I'll give him a 9
because their wig was not advertised as
anything other than what it was which
was a lace front wig now I would it gave
him a 10 but they said it was body wave
and honey soon as that water headed girl
it was it was a smooth way if it wasn't
really buddy like that no more so again
you guys know I feel about body weight
body wave is usually it's just a name
for me it doesn't really hold an actual
like a thing because it doesn't hold
anything it's just what it is now if it
was curly and you're giving me wavy
that's different but this is body wave
girl it's just an S shape it's gonna
fall out unless you put it back in so
again like I said I really enjoy working
with them I really enjoy my
correspondence with them they again like
I said they gave me a pre plucked unit I
went back and I reap lust it so that it
does have more of this natural hair line
going on I'm not a big fan of this look
on anybody
Rihanna quiche kale or anybody but I
just want to say that at least I tried
it I just feel like it still looks like
a hat you know again when anybody does
it like even cardi in motorsport girl
like they was like don't pluck it just
go
all right it like a deal like you know
girl so yeah I'm not crazy about it but
it didn't come out pretty nice and I'm
not mad at it like you know I'm saying
I'm not mad at I said I went to the
store the lady was like oh my god your
natural hair so cute and beautiful I
said girl girl don't be trying to be
funny but yeah like I said earlier I
mess with y'all can y'all just get some
full wigs please okay
can y'all do some full weeks at $75 -
the current price and I will stay on
your site I don't care about Cassie
here's the thing if it was a full wig I
can still take this and actually like do
all of this that I just did to it put a
part down in the middle put two pigtails
add some hair to it like it could be a
great base for something so even
sometimes when I have wigs and I don't
like the density I can still use them if
they're for wigs this is not that so I'm
still very limited on what I can do but
this is still better than a typical lace
wig that you would get from like your
local Beauty Supply because that like be
real hard girl and it is not gonna blend
in like this it's gonna be a real ugly
harsh line okay not cute so if you guys
are interested in this I will put the
links below um like I said I don't know
about whatever it is shedding none I
mean girl I bet not tangling I don't
have that issue either it was very easy
to Flatiron it keeps it keep straight it
does hold a curl however when hair isn't
as full it's very hard for the hair to
want to hold a curl so that's not really
saying much but overall I'm not mad at
it so if you guys are interested hit up
earlier Allaire hair um down below and I
hope you guys enjoyed this and I will
catch you guys in my next and my
installation video is actually coming
this weekend so I did not forget okay
