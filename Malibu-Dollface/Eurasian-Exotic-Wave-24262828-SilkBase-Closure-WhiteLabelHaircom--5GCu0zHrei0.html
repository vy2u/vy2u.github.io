guys I'm happy this is actually my first
video because I actually missed doing
hair reviews believe it or not um so
yeah this hair that I'm rocking right
now that is also beautiful let me just
kid just look at this young um this hair
is from a company called white label
hair and like I said in my end of the
year our video that is taking me a while
to get to this review because I have
been sick and things of that nature but
this hair is everything oh my god okay
so let me get to the specs of it um
again this is from a company called
white label hair and this is there um
eurasian exotic wave hair i did not want
this hair I did not put no cob like crow
cream I didn't put nothing in this hair
this hair is exactly how it is when it
came out well didn't come exactly like
this out of the shipping bag that they
send it to me in um it was more so you
know like you get hair and has like that
uniform curl to it and you just take a
paddle brush and you just you know go
through it and run your fingers through
it and stuff like that but not too much
to disturb the natural state of what
this is so this is what it looks like
just on its own I haven't done anything
to it but just brush it out and that's
it um I have in a 24 or 26 and 228 and I
have also have a silk based 16 inch
closure to match the texture which is
part like this matches perfectly and
sometimes when I had curly hair in the
past what has happened is the closure
will be to match the hair but it doesn't
match the hair so I have to go in and
try to match the curl pattern with a
wand or a curler or whatever but this is
perfect this is all the hair pulled
forward it's really really full and I'm
sure if I went through this some more
with
how to brush it will get even bigger um
this is what it looks like
you know just one side behind me um this
hair y'all is everything this is some
good low maintenance hair to because
it's so big but yet it's so beautiful
like I love hair like you guys know I
have a fixation for big hair like it
just fits my face very well and friends
my face is a lot of less work than
straight hair I don't have to worry
about everything being late and so flat
I can let it flow when the wind blows I
ain't got to worry about like Gerardo um
so yeah I've actually even wearing this
hair for I think about six days now it's
been six days on and off it has not been
consistently but it's been six days on
and off and this is pretty much what my
hair's been looking like everyday um
since well because I didn't wear this
here on New Year's either so that's why
but I did for you part way before and
also I wanted to just point that out to
probably get to how long I've been
wearing it I do not wear so much anymore
everything that you're looking at right
now is on a cap it is not on um it's not
sewn in I have braids up underneath here
but I don't wear sew ins anymore because
I changed my hair too often to be that's
a lot of work and it's easier to it's
easier to wear you parts and or wigs
because what happens is um you can take
care of the hair a little bit more you
know I'm not going to be laying on the
back of this hair I'm not going to be
you know having to braid it down and go
to sleep I can just take it off and put
it on the dresser and put it back in the
bag or whatever I want to you know where
I hire or store them and do it that way
so that's the good thing about wearing
wigs and I'm actually going to not
promise you guys I'm gonna do this
because actually started I just haven't
like filmed the rest of it but I'm gonna
do like a top to bottom how I make my
you parts it's so many videos about how
to make wigs and you parts on here but I
don't know you know you guys have
preferences so you want to tell I'll do
it so of course that's something else
that I'm going to get into because I
think this is definitely I'm a person
about haircare and I do like the fact
that things like this you know wigs and
stuff help us keep our natural hair
still healthy and good and we can still
rock you know this good all your region
exotic wave on without ruining our hair
and trying to make it blend and it
really just don't blend um so yeah
this hair is oh my god charges it's
bouncing it moves which I love I can
throw it which I love it's full it's
very very full you guys know I love for
hair so I have in a 24 24 or 26 and so I
haven't four bundles imagine if I
wouldn't have five uhm but yeah four
bundles is that you can actually get
away with three bundles with this hair
you know believe it or not you can
definitely get away with three bundles
with this but yeah it's just very
natural and I love like just natural
looking hair I love just to be able to
just throw something on and go about my
day and it can blow and do whatever the
hell they want to do and I'll be fine
like girl yeah mm-hmm my hair is still
pretty though you know that type of
situation but I do want to formally
apologize to wile April here because
anyway for this review for a long time
and they have some beautiful hair over
there what I did not know is my aunt
actually um has the exact same hair from
them and I was asking are like what did
you get the hair from because it's rare
this is before they ever contacted me
for review or anything I had no prior
knowledge of them or anything and she's
like yeah I thought this on place and
are online and it's really nice and
their hair is really pretty and yeah
she's still rocking her so when I went
to her house yesterday I had this hair
on and she was like cuz she got you know
you know all the people they like to get
them like them short bundles like girl
let me get a 12-inch you like we what
you gonna do it that's a that's a curly
bob girl that's a while that's the
Beyonce um but yeah she was like all I
have to go and upgrade my situation so
yeah I know people who are have
purchased their hair before I even did
anything you know which is great I again
I love this hair you guys know I've had
a lot of curly hair on this channel and
um it's some of my favorite hair to wear
because it's so easy to manage so I'll
this is this is going in my keepsake box
okay when I started back doing like
reviews and stuff like that for shows
and stuff like that this will be the
hair that I pulled out when I'm not
trying to do my hair like that because
this was so easy the only thing that I
did was I did the entire wig put it on
I didn't even sew it down it's literally
just snug on my head
and um did my baby hairs on the side
make sure my parts was even up on the
side and that was it and yeah so this
for sure is some of my favorite and it's
the beginning of the year so this is a
great way to start off the year with
some nice banyan fly wavy slash curly
hair so if you guys have any questions
about this please let me know check my
Instagram to which is our Malibu doll
face and make sure you check their
Instagram as well which is at white
label hair and see well if you're not
into curling hair like this see what
else they have they have straight hair
wavy hair um you know everything they
have their closures let me say this to
you guys know I love me some closure
store I really do um and they their
closures are really good because
sometimes when you buy closures
especially silk base closures they're
too light or they're too dark sometimes
they come up gray sometimes they be my
you know like my Scout color but then
you guys are uh you know a browner
complexion you like I can't wear that
it's going stupid there's are not too
light there not too dark they're right
in the middle where they're going to
pretty much work for any body which I
freaking love and also when I receive
closures a lot of times with the issue
that I have is the fact that they're so
like flimsy which is they're supposed to
be they're supposed to you know have
some flexibility to them but when you're
sewing them down sometimes I end up with
a an extra piece and sometimes I just
took it over and sew it down because I'm
not doing that but because this one was
a little more on the stiff side it
allowed me to evenly sew the hair all
the way around
um the perimeter so that it wouldn't
have any folds and it was laying flat
and recessed throughout the entire cap
so that was another good thing that I
really liked about it too and it part's
great it's no issues and matches the
hair texture perfectly which it should
so yeah I hope you guys enjoy this thank
you again why label hair I will be doing
an update for this hair I'm gonna start
doing updates on my hair like every
three weeks with it every three weeks um
so that you guys can kind of see whether
it's a wig or some hair how its held up
in that three week span of me having it
so you guys can be like alright I'll
wait three weeks and see if I really
want to buy the hair or not you know I
think that'll be a little bit better
because sometimes I don't know
come back because I very rarely have
issues with my hair from any company and
before I go I want to tell you guys that
while I wear it's also having like a
bundle sale which is really good because
they got some good I don't think none of
this is even over $300 which is dope
you're reusing exotic ways that's what
I'm wearing right now they have four
bundles of this which are 12 14 16 and
18 so if you're not a long person like
me that just wants all of this but you
want something that's similar to it but
a little bit shorter you can get all
those bundles for 295 295 300 bucks do
you know how much money you're saving
right now because yeah so make sure you
guys take advantage of these deals it's
a lot of more deals they have a three
bundle deal they have closure deals as
well so make sure you guys take
advantage of these um because there are
a limited time only oh yeah I will talk
to y'all later
and I hope you guys enjoyed this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
