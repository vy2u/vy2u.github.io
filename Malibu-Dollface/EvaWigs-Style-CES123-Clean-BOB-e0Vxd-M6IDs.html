you can see and this time it's it was
supposed to be above it's meant to be
above it's not a makeshift Bob so um
yeah this is it's really nice I like
this you know y'all know I live for a
good nice cute Bob you know so this
particular Bob is from evil wig um this
particular eunuch is a silk top unit
it's a circulation so it's no lace
except for the back but the actual
parting is just a soap base now I'm
gonna tell you the pros and the cons cuz
I did run into quite a few issues with
this particular one if they weren't
horrible but they it it caused me to do
a little bit more work than I have would
have wanted to do on a bob the first
thing is again with the 2-way caps
usually when you order wigs from
companies that give you two you know we
caps which I have one up under here the
next thing that it kinda came with the
look happens here your neck it came with
these little clips these snap clips I'm
show you some like everything right here
but um yeah they came with these little
snap clips or whatever and it came what
I think four of those and then they also
gave me this which is a wig home now I'm
gonna get to this little hump right here
in a second because so whatever's on
this way came and it's a pretty unit the
hair is pretty it didn't come with the
card no it didn't come with the card
that tells me all the information about
the week or whatever so if you want to
know
information about what type of texture
hair this is and the length I think is
14 inches if I'm not mistaken I will
post all of that either annotation in
this video or I will put it well I'm
gonna put the link to the wig and
actually um the way expects below when I
received this particular unit it had a
middle part and I don't know for the
life of me why a company would put a bob
in the middle part and you know it's
really hard to part these wigs like
they're very difficult to to part but
this one was the most difficult wig I've
had to part by far because it took me
over an hour to just get it as flat as
it is right now and that's a problem
like I don't want the reason why you
know most people were gonna buy the unit
is because I want to wear it like this
in an asymmetrical you know nice side
parted Bob so to have it with a middle
part and you had to take the middle part
out to put it in a side part is a bit
mm-hmm that's the thing that I had the
most issue with I haven't had any
shedding there is combs in the on size
and in the back there's a just above
strap in the back I think yeah there's
an adjustable strap in the back there
are no combs like around the temples or
whatever and then all of this section is
my sub base but yeah it's the the
parting was a nightmare it because it a
party great once I got into where I
wanted it to go and then another thing
that I didn't like is that you guys know
I like a very plummeted side part like
such a usually my party's a much further
over than this but because of how the
wig is cut if I would have pushed this
wig any further this would have been
this short and this would have been this
long and that would have been a problem
so yeah um I will curl like you know
bump the front of this if I really
wanted to but he's gonna look like my
other one that I accidentally well I
accidentally on purpose made into a bob
but yeah besides that it's a nice unit
it fits well it doesn't hurt because
sometimes when you get
the wigs and I have the combs in them
the comb sometimes they really hurt um
so yeah but it is bump this bump right
here I'm not loving I I don't know what
I'm gonna do I might have to set it
overnight because I just did it you know
so maybe it's because it's still fresh
it's gonna take a second but I've never
had to do that for any other unions
where I've had to put water or set them
overnight or put a scarf on them or
whatever the situation is closures yes
but never an actual wig so I laid it as
as good as I I felt like I could if you
throw if I was to throw let's just say a
curl in the front or whatever and we'll
make them this bump makes sense it's
supposed to lay like this this is what
it's supposed to look like right now
so if it was laid like I wanted to then
my pop would look like this mm-hmm
but because it's not looks like that and
that's not really cute so you put like a
buckle in if I did like this and put
like cut it and then put like a buckle
like a bump right here this would make
sense but because it's straight and it's
just here mm so yeah like I said it's a
very well constructed wig I don't have
any problems you normally I don't have
any issues or problems with companies
when it comes down to wigs or bobs for
that matter unless they have color or
something but this one actually is all
black and this is the first all black
Bob that I've ever had besides the
makeshift one that I made but this one
is the only one that actually came as a
bob the back is nice but it's got really
nice in the back I just didn't really
bump it like I should have because I had
flat iron the entire head straight to
bump it because the bump that it came in
it was a little too grandma
oh yeah it's a nice unit if you're
interested I'll put the link for this
particular link below and you can get
funky with it you can it don't have to
be as structured as mine's is you can
you know get a little crazy it being so
based which I had to get custom so I
took a little bit longer than it nor
with a ticket fit it was a simple stock
wig but I had to wait a little bit
longer and if you guys know if you want
still face to subway certainly cost us
more um but yeah it's cute summer hair
you know like if you want to just throw
in like this would be really cute with
some overalls and like some cubes like a
cute long-sleeve shirt that's cropped or
something like that with the cute Bob
and some like sexy glasses this would be
really cute but this bump just because
he just gives me Wendy Williams is what
it's giving me with this hump right here
well yeah I do like it I think it's
pretty and if you are interested in this
please check the below bar and I will
probably since I'd like to come back and
update you on the Bob's I'll probably
come back with a whole new damn color
for this bob who knows but yeah that's
hot and I was hot see ya later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
