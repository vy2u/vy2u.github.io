hair is very different from what I'm
used to rocking and I know a lot of you
guys always say can you do more natural
wig styles and stuff like that since the
only one I think I've ever did was the
Italian yaki wig so I decided to try
something a little bit different this
wig is actually from Eagles wig with
evil wigs and you guys know I review for
them probably I think a couple of months
ago I had the custom black bob with some
top and I didn't like how the same top
was or whatever but this week I really
really really like um when I received it
is there kinky texture so when I
received it it did not look like this it
had more of a jheri curl ish look to it
so what I did was I took my paddle brush
and I just rushed through all of the
jury curliness and that's word um to get
more of this very kinky Afrocentric very
natural-looking awake type get down um I
love this I will have to say this is one
of my favorite wigs now because although
it's really hard I wouldn't wear this in
the sometime the winter this would be
very very very perfect the parting was
very easy it did not give me no issues
and no problems and I do like the
natural styles you know like the natural
hair Nazis y'all can lie and say - I
don't never take natural hair no more
because I do natural hair look is
natural it just comes off
- um so let me give you guys the specs
on this particular wig this is Q number
I don't know because their handwriting
is really bad so I'm gonna put it on the
bottom it's the natural black and the
length is I don't know it should be
listed below cuz this person to Harden
is important when I received it it came
with thanks thank you for sending me
weight a wig cap and my color now not a
brown one but this light color that's on
the package thank you hang with two
pieces I think the second one is
interesting and then it did not come
with any college that's kind of the
downfall about this entire wig it did
not come with any homes it has the lace
in the back and has a lace around a
perimeter but they give you these these
clips that you can put in the wig the
storm into the wig if you need them or
whatever since i pull mines on and off
that's unnecessary it came with a home
and it came with an instruction manual a
user's manual or whatever so you guys
can go for that decide to purchase um I
had this way for about I want to say
like a week do some change now and
hasn't shed it on me it does get quite
see like it's like real african-american
hair like you know girls be like I've
been wearing my natural hair and they do
a length check and then they go like
this and then the hair is all the way
down here is like that so is that type
of hair where it will bounce back on you
I would not suggest straightening his
hair at any point if you're going for
this natural look because I'm sure that
would knock the original kinkiness out
of it but this could be my hair this
could be just you know I was this
natural Nazi relaxers so you know that
could be the situation if that's what
you want to say um but no it's just it's
really nice and the more that you pull
it the longer it's going to get so when
I first started the video was kind of
short so now as I'm pulling on it as you
can see it's getting longer
longer so I do like this I'd be like
this a lot I will say that um no
problems it's just that when you're
brushing you're going to it you're gonna
get that pop back cuz it's really tight
like when I received it it should be a
picture somewhere up in here would it
look like when I first got it in it was
really tight I was like I don't know
what I'm gonna do with this and why did
I pick this way because I don't you know
but it's really nice though it gives you
this my heavy still I swear my hair like
this like in this myspace days um I just
wear my hair like this
and people loved it so this is kind of
that it was more curly than it is more
so kinky but to be able to just take
this on and take this off is a plus
um so yeah I have nothing bad to say
about this if you want more of a natural
texture looking of a wig and you don't
want to have to do all the maintenance
to have it try to blend in all of this
the only thing that I did was I put it
on I put some concealer up underneath
and then um at the top I put some
concealer just just blend it through but
yeah it stops right here and then this
is my baby here right here so yeah I
love it let me know if you like it it's
a lot of hair though I will say that it
is a lot of hair so you got to get to
learning and I got to remember how you
should take my other hair because I'm so
used to wearing straight here but having
my Italian yaki one they did help me you
know here for this bhishma this is
really cute it's cute for back to school
so I'm gonna just put on only thing that
I would suggest though cuz the lace is a
little light very buttery so put some
clips in it don't just wear it is like
this you know cuz it will slip like as
you can see it
I worship so but yeah I'm not this so
you guys want to know any more about
this wig make sure you visit he was
wicked we'll put the link below and all
information should have been somewhere
within this video for this particular
wig and um I'll come back cuz I'm gonna
be wearing this one periodically just
like our lying Yankee long time and now
I'm still kicking so I'm gonna come back
and let you guys know how this one is
holding up for me or whatever I'm not
gonna put it back in a bag that it came
in
oh one more point that I wanted to make
as well when I did receive this wig this
is what's the downfall that I did not
like um it smelled like relaxer okay
just like it had a very I don't know
what it was but because of the texture I
would assume that it was relaxing so it
did the smell was a little punchy so I
did go wash it first
um and put like a little bit of fabric
softener in it to kind of get the smell
out it wasn't horrible but it's just not
something that I just want to walk
around my head on it and I got this
beautiful kinky Afrocentric hair and as
soon as I walked past I'm smelling like
dirt so I don't know even wig y'all want
to kind of figure that situation out but
I will be honest I mind is my like
relaxed when I when I received it so
besides that though I don't have any
problems and I just wish you had a
comment saying I really do because I
don't have to so nothing up in here but
you know it is what it is so if you guys
enjoyed this and you guys liked it
thumbs up let me know what you like let
me know what you think and let me know
if you guys think I should do more of a
more natural wigs like you know not
something so much always straight more
of like natural wigs because you need to
do like the instruments and stuff on
this so yeah again let me know how you
guys enjoyed this see y'all later after
like Deloris van Cartier from Sister Act
