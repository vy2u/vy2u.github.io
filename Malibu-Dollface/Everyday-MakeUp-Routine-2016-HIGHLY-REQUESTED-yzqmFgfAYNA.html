no brows and we're gonna do this look
brows highlight contour lips so yeah
this is what I wear pretty much every
day so we're gonna start off with the
Mac prep and prime powder
I mean primer which is in skin based
visage and the Rimmel stay matte primer
I mix these two together because I
really think they work to keep me matte
my foundation is the Mac full coverage
foundation in NW 40 and you can get this
only at a pro store so find a local Road
store near you to get those they're like
the Paint Pot for your eyebrows the
concealer and I'm using the mineralized
skinfinish by Mac and then I'm using my
Anastasia Beverly Hills cream contour
kit in medium and I pretty much contour
my face like you see in the diagrams but
I already have a chiseled face so we're
gonna just choose the lid up because
when you put the found a I mean you get
a foundation on it kind of takes all
your features away so I'm just pretty
much putting them back I like to use the
banana color for my highlight and ash
Brown for my contour I had one of the
new Beauty blenders and nude because I
find that the pink ones get really ugly
no matter how much you wash them they
don't only they don't always turn right
back pink they still be a little off so
I find that the nude one just makes it
look a little better um and I just use
the soap that they provide well they
offer you to buy as so for to actually
clean all your Beauty Blender products
um and I love it I like to use um
debuted with the Beauty Blender
excuse me to actually put my banana
powder on this is a Ben Nye banana
powder the luxurious banana pot
everybody loves I like the anasazi of
banana however it's not finely ground
like this is so this actually seeps into
the highlight color and stays so when it
actually cures or bakes as you will um
it still looks like your face is just
flawless so I'm using a pencil from Mac
and spiked to carve out my eyebrows and
this took you know these the browser
they look kind of like the most
important thing other than your contour
and highlight because they pretty much
frame your face so if you do not get
your
eyebrows right then your makeup is gonna
fall flat and it's a give or take
it depends for me I don't know what it
is and I think we all have these you
know eyebrow issues because you know
your eyebrows are sisters never twins
but they don't always look the same so
on my tailpiece I like to use our darker
color which is my NYX or this actually
might be urban decay pencil um and black
bean so if it's NYX is black bean its
urban decay I don't recall what it is
and I take it and I just blend the
colors together so the brown color I use
from the spike and then I use the black
color on the ends to define the
tailpiece and you'll see why in a second
once I actually start to UM conceal up
under my eyebrows to define them you'll
see why I decided to do this when drama
eyebrows on I tend to draw them on a
little sloppy and try to get the the
gist of the shape it does not have to be
perfect because you can go back and
always clean it up but sometimes when
you try to make it super do perfect you
end up having to keep putting more and
more pencil on to try to get it to have
this willies for me I will say that so
as you can see that one is thicker than
the other but later on I'm actually
going to fix that so I'm using my
concealer that is in in c42 to conceal
up underneath my eyebrows and if you
watch here you'll see that all the extra
mistakes I made is fun because it makes
me gives me this nice sharp point at the
end so it looks like that I went and had
a nice wax when actually I didn't one
thing I did was concealed my eyebrows so
if you look at what I look like in the
beginning with the little ticks Alcala
eyebrows they my eyebrows just growing
very sparse and they don't run very full
so I pretty much shave them down so I
can drawing whatever shape I want to so
they can look exactly like I want them
to so pretty much here is I'm going to
go in with the other eyebrow and
concealer like I did that one as you see
there's a big difference and I like my
eyebrows to be kind of not straight
across I like the arch but I like them
to have kind of a longer look I'm not
really a big fan of our super arch just
because my face is
kind of round I don't really like you
know is like Brandis eyebrows kind of
like hers I like her shape because she
has more of a flatter face and I'm kind
of similar like that like I have a big a
big face looks just so good and in here
you see I'm going in I'm just cleaning
up and kind of were there wherever there
gaps I'm putting it back in and I notice
that this eyebrow pad less of the arch
than that one so I'm trying to match it
and here I usually don't do this I used
to back in the day then I stopped doing
it
concealing the top part because I find
that it's just sometimes it does give
you the halo no matter how much you
blend it out so to avoid that I only do
the bottom but today I actually had to
do the top because that fix it and I
take my spoolie which is the thing this
one is from us on your cushion most of
these brushes are my own you got your
brushes and my elf brushes and you just
take it and you pull the color to the
front so it's going to give you this
nice gradient like you have these nice
tweezers and they're still a little
bushy in the front so they look natural
you don't want to leave that nice or not
nice that harsh line in the beginning
because it looks terrible so I'm gonna
take my favorite palette in the world
which is my naked 3 palette from Urban
Decay as well as the original Urban
Decay primer potion and I'm gonna put it
on my eyelids just to prime them a
little bit because I'm gonna do a
natural color I don't want it to look
crazy I don't want nothing I want it
subtle I want it to be a soft color with
a little dimension and here's where I
went back in because I didn't like it
and I'm using my uh Nastasia Beverly
Hills it's like a double sided brush one
has a flat head on other side and the
other side has a belief and I got that
from Sephora so the first color that I'm
going to use it's called nooner and it's
just this nice opaque pinkish color and
um it always starts for me as a good
base I just started using it probably
like later last year because I've had
this the same palette I had since my
last damn tutorial um so you know how
much I don't want makeup but I'm gonna
take the color and Blackheart which is a
glitter
black color and I'm gonna put it in my
crease color now I remember when I first
did this I was still very new to makeup
again these are my selling you catch
your brushes just be tapered eyeshadow
brush and I just pretty much blend the
color out and I'm going to keep
deepening and deepen it until it's
actually as deep as I want but because
my eyes are very small I always tend to
do more of a dramatic eye even if it is
a subtle just because I feel like if I
don't my face just looks very very very
bland no matter how much contour and
highlighter I actually do it just
doesn't look very nice so yeah I'm just
taking that black heart and blending it
out with that nooner color so it has
this nice gradient and creating a darker
color in my crease area I think I was
spending a black first album and I was
really pulling away on this day logic
and then I took or my highlight it's
actually my brow colors called strange
is what I use and then I went ahead into
my finger and dipped it in a color
called the buzz and it's actually a
glitter color very close to nooner and I
just patted it right on top of that just
to give it a little glitter because the
black heart has some glitter in it too
so I wanted to have a bit of um you know
so anyway my liner is the Tarte a
tourist clay liner I think that's how
you say um and usually you guys know I'm
not really one for like doing liner
myself because I find that they dry out
and I really don't like them you guys
know I'm a big fan of the Kat Von D
liner and I forgot I think it's got a
troop and I do use that still but I'm
trying to wing myself off of that to
kind of get comfortable and using the
Axl liquid liner and it will clay line
and however you want to put it this is
actually very well formulated the brush
actually came with the liner itself the
clay itself and it comes in this little
tube so it doesn't dry your product I'm
honest idea Beverly Hills drew that
drove I mean a dried out on me and you
put a little oil in it do come back at
any point
um but yeah this actually works very
well I did a simple liner I didn't want
it too thick and I kind of made it go
out towards my face versus up like more
so a cat eye just because I wanted my
face to look a little cool but not crazy
because again because they look natural
books there's I mean you know you don't
look crazy even if I was doing like a
like a black um smoky eye
then I would have done it a little more
dramatic but you see it kind of pulls my
face up and it matches my eyes to my um
my cheekbones so I'm taking that black
hard color again and putting it on my
lash line I we I'm stopped using
eyeliner as much um just because I
wanted to try something different and I
find out what I do looks like this is
better that I don't use eyeliner and
just use the eye shadow up under my brow
bone I mean my lash line and then here
I'm just dusting off my banana powder
and you see how nice and Cris my face
look now it looks all mattified and nice
sixty so I'm gonna take my uh Nastasia
Beverly Hills um contour kit the powder
one and I'm just I took like a dome
brush and contour my nose just a little
bit more so I'm taking some more of that
Mac mineralized skinfinish and dark and
just going over and it's bringing back
my color so I'm still highlighted in
contour but I still look like myself I
don't look like a clay - now this stuff
is the Urban Decay Naked illuminator and
you can't really tell on this camera cuz
my other cameras having lunch utter
situations so I couldn't use it but in
person you can tell it gives you this
nice pretty eye month ago as soon as I
finish this video I'm going back to
support because I need the other two
that they still but this one is in late
so it's more like a golden is it remind
you comment of max go deposit that's the
best example I give you and then I went
back and I think I took nooner and just
complimented with it
which I just wanted it to be a little
more dramatic so I feel like my nose was
still looking a little too big so you
know the more the merrier and then I
just went ahead and blended it out so it
just didn't look so obvious
and then I took my NARS albatross which
I swear by thanks to your own and I just
used it to add a little more Sheen and a
little more glow enos to my face so this
is Too Faced better than sex mascara
have two I have one in the like travel
sample size and I have the big one
that's in my hand I find that the
smaller one you works better on my
natural lashes because the brush is
smaller and I use it sometimes on my
bottom lashes which I didn't put none on
today and then I like to use the bigger
one when I'm doing falsies and then I'm
using Mac's chestnut for my lips which
is like a Leah's favorite so that's a
tip I got from the leader and she amount
Garbus or so and um i line my lips with
this and then I take my nude beige from
YSL which is one of the moisture shrines
and Kat Von D's Noble and I mesh these
together to kind of give me that
gradient ombre lip that I love also much
since the 90s isn't in a hell of a
comeback and then I just use this um Kat
Von D to put on top of it you know
anticipate the color but it also
modifies my lips I didn't do this on
camera but I use these lashes which are
from lash luxury lashes and these are
the mink
fluff crisscross one's a little bit more
noble on the lips and a little bit more
of that the girl dark mineralized
skinfinish and that's it I hope you guys
enjoy a list of detailed products will
be in the description bar Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
