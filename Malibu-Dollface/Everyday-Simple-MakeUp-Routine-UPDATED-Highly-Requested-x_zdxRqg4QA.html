I don't have any makeup on so I'm gonna
do my makeup first and I'm gonna
probably do a voiceover because I don't
wanna have to talk to everything that
I'm doing because it's gonna take
forever so let's get started I'll try to
show everything that I'm using I'm gonna
use most of the stuff that's in here or
whatever but yeah I'll probably I'll try
to point everything to the camera as we
go so let's get so here I'm just
applying my Rimmel stay matte primer
this helps keep all of the extra excess
oils out and this is my
beautiful
now I'm going to apply my minds clay
foundation in clay to and this pretty
much is gonna cover up and give me more
of a full coverage because my BB cream
was more for a light to cheer coverage
okay
Oh
okay okay this is my NARS creamy
concealer it's in custard it blends out
beautifully and it's great for
highlighting
good
no please
how you feel
this is my wedding while ticket to
Brazil bronzer and I just used this to
pretty much say my foundation and my
highlight just kind of blend them
together a little bit be far go any
further
now if you take your spoolie and you
kind of pull it a little further if your
eyebrows are like mine's very far apart
it would just kind of draw them in and
pull some of that color towards each
other without making them look like
twins we're gonna take the concealer
here and do the concealer trick it makes
a pretty much clean out the eyebrows
from this point away
so from Tunica 3 palette I use three
colors I use limit on my lid I use
nooner in the crease and then I use dust
in my tear ducts so pretty much these
two colors are very new pink colors but
one is darker than get out of so when
it's going to pretty much be the
transitional color and I believe I use a
black the black is color that's in the
palette to kind of deepen up the crease
just a tad
if I never see you
but
so here I'm going to use two different
felt pin liners the first one is going
to be my Kat Von D I used two different
ones because they're easier when it's
better for a precision the other is
better for a wing but they're both they
work great together because they're both
the same dark color but I used a Kat Von
D on my actual water well top whatever
that's called the lid line will get the
eyeliner line and I used this well I'm
still using the Kat Von D here but it's
easier to do then to actually use gel
liner for me and there's just more of
preference you don't have to do this
this is just what I use
this is like the best eyeliner ever this
is the Urban Decay 24-hour glide on
eyeliner it's perfect
now I'm taking Blackheart which is our
use also on my crease and pretty much
rubbed it up underneath my eyes just to
kind of give it more of a dramatic look
you know have everything bloom together
and I'm gonna take some fix+ and put it
in dust and this is gonna be more of
that pretty look that I like and I'll do
this pretty much every time I wear
makeup just because it is cute you can
tell I have own makeup but it's not too
much where I look like
I'm gonna take this really old elf
bronzer I don't know what it's called
it's all broke up the tag is jacked up
but it's great for contouring I love
this it's a powder so I don't have to
set it in this brush is an angled brush
from my ELF set that I love so very much
okay this is my Tom Ford lipstick in
nude vanilla and this is not the color
that I always wear but it's pretty much
similar to my other ones this one is a
little more drying and this is of course
my Turkish Delight from NARS that I love
so very much thank you Kim Kardashian
and this is albatross by NARS which I
love because I see it gives me like this
shiny like dewy look on my face without
my face looking really really wet so
yeah alright this is classic Maybelline
I think this is Maybelline whatever you
know this damn I hate this this mascara
but I'm just trying to get rid of it so
I can get some more any suggestions on
my scale let me know this is my Urban
Decay chill makeup sealer this actually
really does work and that's the finished
look so it's simple is to the point it's
pretty and you know it's like I got all
makeup but I don't look like a clown you
know so I hope you guys enjoyed this and
I will see you guys in the next video
bye bye
