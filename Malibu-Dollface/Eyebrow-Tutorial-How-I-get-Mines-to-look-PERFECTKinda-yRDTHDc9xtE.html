I've never done this before so we're
gonna do an eyebrow tutorial if I look
over the camera that's because I'm
looking at the mirror because I need to
see what I'm doing
so basically since I started doing my
eyebrows a lot of people have requested
that I do a tutorial and let me just
tell you I am NOT a professional I don't
not do this add your hair I don't man do
makeup so if it's a little off or it's
not what you are used to just ignore
this step okay I'm not gonna do nothing
crazy like put you know concealer on my
eyeballs or something like that um so
basically this is just basically how to
get your eyebrows to just look full and
look nice and neat or whatever you want
to call it um so yeah every time I do
this sometimes it doesn't come out like
how one eight other times is like
rubbery so hopefully today it's a breeze
for I'm gonna direct you to someone's
channel name be face honey which is my
girl miss tatianna Ward here on YouTube
with you guys know me you guys know I
have talked about her in the past cuz
she's just dope and I learned how to do
this from her and the techniques that
she showed me and then I took what she
did and kind of add him you know what I
like to do cuz there's some skip steps
skips steps that she does that I don't
do and vice versa okay so what you're
gonna need first and foremost is you're
gonna need like a brow pencil this
pencil is from Mac it's like worn all
off and I highly doubt that y'all can
see any of that but it's basically a
brow pencil crayon from Mac is cost
spiked it's a pencil that looks like
this and you can you know wind them up
at the top so that you can get what you
need from them you're gonna need one of
these or something like it I know Revlon
I think is Revlon has one like this it's
probably half the price you're gonna
need some concealer and this is max NC
42 studio finish concealer this is like
a shade lighter to me I actually use
this to contour my face um well actually
highlight my face
let me use a different color I use this
and just blend it in and it gives me a
nice refreshed look like I don't have
right now like mine I woke up like 30
minutes ago um you need like an angle
brush to put the concealer on this brush
is actually from Ecotools I think it was
that gonna brush that I had so I went up
um you're gonna need a spoolie just to
brush out the brows to make sure that
they not look in but Shanti ish you know
you don't want to look crazy
you're gonna need oh and you're gonna
need this is the optional brush but I
use a smudge brush and you're gonna see
why in a minute some people use a finger
but I don't like to do that anymore I
used to but I don't do that anymore okay
so what you're gonna do
hold on let me make sure I'm close
enough cuz you know I don't do this on a
regular basis you know I'm just saying
um so what you're gonna do is you're
going to take your crayon brush I guess
you could say that's what you want to
call it um some people use the arm like
a pencil like this I mean I hope it
ain't black this is like an off brown
color and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
trace where I want my brows to be no as
you can see there is a nice distance
between both of my eyebrows which I like
some people which I don't get but if
that's what you do that's what you do
will fill their eyebrows in from here
and start feeling here in here and start
feeling here and it just make sure
eyebrows look so unnatural I like to
keep where this starts I don't like to
mess with this only mess with this okay
sometimes I'll go in and shake the same
so it's this dark is this but I don't
like to try and make this longer it
obviously there is a space this long
space between them for reasons so we're
gonna keep it so I'm gonna use this as a
basic outline I plug my eyebrows so as
you can see I was lazy on this little
part but we don't cover them you see
we're concealer um but yeah so what
you're gonna do is you're gonna trace it
my eyebrows have the basic shape that I
want except the only issue that I have
with mine is that they're too low
so basically you see you probably can or
you can see this is a little bit higher
than this line here so that's what we
don't want so we're gonna changed it so
we're gonna do is you're gonna take this
and just small strokes and fill this in
okay
that's basically the tale of the arch
you can make this arch more deeper than
you want as you can see it was like a
nudge in there full hair missing because
I've over plucked it but that's fine
um with the concealer but basically this
is to give you your overall shape of the
eye you can always go back and take an
ad which you do where you don't want so
what you're gonna do is always use small
strokes this is not a coloring book your
face is not a coloring book so don't
just draw like that um because what's
gonna end up happening this is just
gonna be too blunt and it's not gonna
look natural so small strokes always
work and you use less product when you
lose small strokes as well so you're
gonna just comb this up to what you want
and then use this to just blend which
you don't need now what I do want is I
want to arch this side actually has
somewhat of an arch here so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to add an arch
all the way up in here so we're gonna
just take this line and bring it up
okay then just fill this section and
okay so now we're getting the general
shape of what we okay so basically we
have this is pretty much the shape this
one looks more like this one now okay so
if you want to get a little more
dramatic about it you can pull up the
tail piece down you can make this higher
if you feel the need to that's the look
you're going for fill this in alright so
then what you're gonna do is you're
gonna take your concealer and so you can
see there you're gonna take the angle
brush and I just rub it like this I just
rub it in the concealer why not um take
the angle part of the brush you just
fully before you do it because it's
gonna basically blend that pencil now
for that step some people will only use
that pencil to outline and then put
eyeshadow there I don't like to use
eyeshadow because it tends to just make
my face look too I mean my brow is just
too dark this is the perfect color so I
don't like it to be too dark I like it
to just be a little bit like an off
brown um
so you take that what you just dipped in
the concealer and you just trace around
the brow okay and then you take that
same brush some people don't do the top
I personally do
okay amazingly diets which are eyebrow
ends up looking like so you see like
when I traced it in it wasn't perfect
sometimes I do it it's perfect other
times I'll do it it's not so perfect so
it just really depends on the day and
what the hell I'm going through so
basically that's how my eyebrow is gonna
look when I'm all said and done they
finish the eyebrow shape that I like is
how I arched them the shape that I like
who I get the inspiration from is Aliyah
I can't wear my eyebrows just like a
leaders due to the simple fact that her
face shape was a little tad different
demise so if you do see some little
brows that you do like they're not gonna
always look exactly like the persons do
to your face shake I can't have my
eyebrows go from here to here because
someone else is so when that's all said
and done which you can do is and some
people would just take the finger and
fan the concealer out which is cool but
I just find it it becomes messy and I
just don't like to do it so I just take
a smudge brush and we just take that and
smudge the concealer down so you can
still have that highlighted effect which
you don't have to just get off I can
dirty doing it you know and then you go
over it and then once you get it dulled
down enough then you can um you can gone
and smudge it out yourself
now this often happens and I'm sure you
guys just seen that that when I did this
some of my brow right here disappeared
we're just fine because the only thing
that you do is you simply take that same
brush I mean the same pencil that you
had and now you have a very clean line
to go back okay so this is my camera
wanted to cut off this is basically how
the brow looks and this is how the one
that's not done looks so you can see
there is a difference and I don't want
anything dramatic I just want my
eyebrows to looked as if they were doing
you know I don't want to
be looking like my eyebrows I don't know
dry clean eyebrows you know if that's
what you like and that's what you're
going for then more power to you that's
just not what I'm into
so the problem that people have is that
sometimes they want the arch higher and
sometimes the arch just is entire so
what you can do is you can take this
start from here and just go higher like
this and just fill that in now you see
how that little bit of difference just
made a world of a difference in the
eyebrow itself because it made it look
higher and more art sometimes I'll do
them and they don't be exactly how I
want it you just go in it just it's all
about time management and being being
patient you know patience is a virtue
and it's very true especially when it
comes to your eyebrows so you see how
this eyebrow I didn't touch anything
here so it all has a nice flow to it
these are not this is imperfect how you
should do them but because I'm doing
this from a very far distance this is
gonna have to be as good as it's gonna
be um now another issue that people have
is the fact that they can never get
their eyebrows to match they were like I
can't do it they don't never look the
same and that's true your eyebrows are
sisters they're not identical twins so
they ain't gonna always look the same
but what you can always do is you can I
can eyeball it and the reason why I did
this one before I did this one is
because this one had more of the shape
that I wanted than this one so I use
this as a template so now i'ma go in and
fill this one in now you see how this
one already has like what I already need
so and you just I can eyeball it to kind
of get the shape that I want which it
kind of already has and this just means
some height
yeah let's just meet some over let's see
and it's not filled in all the way but I
just want to make sure the basic shape
is right yeah and then what you can do
is when you want that real crispy look
you go fix that with your concealer so
just try and get it to coat as close as
you can to the the basic shape of this
eyebrow so that when you go in with the
concealer you can really jazz it the
hell up and get what you're really
really really not okay now some people
will fill in our eyebrows like this and
in God's house I don't really think
that's cute cuz it just looks thick that
doesn't look thick you see the
difference that isn't look thick
that looks thick and I see people that
do them thicker so you know this
basically has this shape that I want
they're pretty damn close and if they're
not close then I must be belonging
now it's higher we'll we can fix that
okay so basically this is what I want so
we're gonna go back with your mat
concealer or whatever concealer you can
use whatever concealer you want of your
choice just make sure it's a cream
concealer we're gonna rub that in there
and then outline exactly okay so there
you go it has that shape get a little
higher and that's what I mean by you can
change the shape of it how you want now
you just take it some people always get
this part wrong you just rub it just run
it across the top don't ruin this shape
you have but just roll it run it across
the top okay now as you can see this one
comes up a little bit more in this area
then this one does so I'm going to just
take this and
arch it a little bit my there we go it's
a little bit longer but it's fine so you
see how I just changed the basic shape
of that to get it exactly how I want it
okay and then you take again a smudge
brush I've been known to put my
foundation on this brush as well to to
really make this concealer blend into my
skin very well if you put in the eye
shadow the bottom part you can use as a
base for your eye shadow but the top you
wanna always make sure this top is
blended out because you don't want
Casper the ghost you see how this side
doesn't have that but this eye does you
don't know that walking out the house
because everybody gonna know you've been
using a hell of a lot concealer on your
do my brows and thank you
I mean unless just look you going
forward
damn by all means work it out all right
no you still want like witch or eyebrows
you still want them to have that kind of
halo look but not really you want to
have just enough so that they look as if
they're doing you know okay and there
you go so this is my eyebrows now you
know they have a very basic shape
they're actually not the same but
they're very close um oh yeah my face
look different I look a little fuller I
look a little more awake um but yeah
it's not that hard it's just it comes
with practice when I first did them they
were so thick and they were not like
this um but they come and practice and
again leave this area of your you know
your eyebrows alone because this is your
outline
if you cut your eyebrows off then by all
means you really don't have a choice but
if you go like this
and you do this with one of your brushes
from your tip of your nose here then
that I'll tell you where your eyebrow is
supposed to be you know so you didn't
have anything then you would know if you
frown wherever these two pieces come
that's where your eyebrow should start
they should not start in here
that's not it don't look natural when
people were gonna know that you feel
gyros in so yeah and always make sure
you use your spoon to you know take that
color to blend it into your eyebrows
because it's gonna give them a seamless
look like you just want to got them
freshly waxed and you got some really
bushy eyebrows so if you have any
questions let me know
again the products that I used was Mac's
a studio finish in c42 concealer a
angled brush I use Mac's pencil brow
pencil and spiked and a spoolie and just
a basic ol smudge brush and you can have
great eyebrows too so if you have any
questions or anything um let me know and
I'll talk to you guys later okay so I
noticed that because the light behind me
was kind of washing me out he wasn't
getting like actually what I did but
this eyebrow is lower than this one and
there's nothing I can do about that
unless I draw this one in lore which is
just look stupid so this is basically
what my eyebrow looks like and this is
what this one looks like and it's just
what they look like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
