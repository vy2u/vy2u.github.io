irritated right now yo like seriously
I'm just I'm irritated beyond the
fucking max I must've done my hair in a
ponytail cause this shit is acting
stupid today and it's not the hair it's
me cuz I got into the damn shower and my
hair got fucking poopy is hail so that's
an irritation I have right now well I'm
gonna tell you what my real irritation
is coming from at this particular moment
is that I fucking hate eBay and I'm
about to tell you why cuz this shit has
pissing me the fuck off so yeah I'm
doing 22 I'm about to do bone closed
today cuz I'm just like fuckin over it
my hair is poofy is big it's just it's
not my friend whatever so any of you
guys who are familiar with me I don't
say nothing about my hair cuz the shit
is it's poufy whatever I'm not about to
go over it I'm just over it so for those
who know me y'all know I love me some
Barbie okay and I like exclusive Barbie
things that don't nobody owes have
because you know it's just it's just
great you know like who the fuck you
know got a pink Corvette
not many people Barbie was the first
probably I don't know I did my eyebrows
I gonna make a phone so whatever so um I
found in 2009 there was it was Barbies
50th anniversary or whatever so they had
a lot of 50th anniversary stuff one of
the things that they had what they did
was they did like a monogram of like all
the Barbies in the last 50 years
so they did a duffel bag I have a thing
and his obsession with duffle bags
preferably Barbie duffle bags so I'm
just like okay I'm gonna get it my
dumbass just allowed the shit to to just
sit on the site and buy time actually
once I'll get it my fault it was missing
so I called Barbie Collector and asked
them if they were getting any more and
she told me no they would that were
limited edition
a15 no they ate made 800 of them and
they're not getting any more so I was
pissed the fuck off
this was 2009 I was like okay well just
get it on eBay I probably find somebody
even who has a bag y'all seriously there
that bag has not been on eBay since 2009
and if it has I missed it I literally
searched that back for that bag every
single day so that I can get it about a
week ago no it was the 26 which is a
week and some change ago I was on eBay
you know doing my daily search the
fucking bag popped up
do you guys know I was so fucking
excited I said it's here and I'm not
even being funny right now like I was
dead ass serious cuz it had been so long
you know you try to find something and
you kind of forget about it and you go
look for it or you go somewhere and you
see it and you just get hyped okay
that's how I felt so I'm like okay I get
it the bag normal price was $60 so they
had it for $29 for $8 shipping so I'm
just like okay whatever that's nothing
um so I said what I'm what I usually do
on eBay I'll wait into the bid it's up
to not run up the price you know some
people don't do that I personally do
that because I shop on eBay a lot so I'm
like okay whatever the situation is they
said that it will take six days which
was today the third at 6:53 a.m. it the
bid would be over so I said okay I'm
away to like the last minute and put my
feet in or whatever so I did it I did a
bit earlier today well earlier yesterday
and I was the highest bidder for like a
couple hours and then somebody came and
I bid me and I was like whatever I'll
just do it at the end now I went and put
the shit in or whatever and I was good
do you know that somebody fucking outbid
me by a tenth of a fucking second a
tenth of a second and a dollar this is
my issue that I have with eBay because
this is not the first time there's some
shit like this has happened to me which
is why I'm not really surprised but I'm
pissed off because I really wanted that
fucking bag like I know it's a duffle
bag or something I'm like
our mad for no reason no bitch I got a
motherfucking reason to be mad because
this is some shit that I want it really
bad in now I can't fucking get because a
stupid bitch I'm fucking eBay who died
probably one want the back for anything
I don't know what let me just stop cuz I
don't even know what they want they
might like Barbie too but they not
allowed to like her like I do so after
that happened like you guys don't
understand I was this close to crying
and maybe that's cuz I get usually what
I want okay so here's my issue
I have several Barbie items as far as
luggage is concerned and this is what it
is
the bag is this size okay this is
another one of my Barbie duffle bags
from Barbie Collector and it has all of
the Barbie stilettos on it in every
other one of those are piece and it's
lined in you know the Barbie pink or
whatever and then it has the well it
says Barbie and inside or whatever so it
the bag is this size it's huge so what
is in this monogram this is another one
this one is lying in pink too but it has
all of the Barbies that have been out in
the last 50 years and iconic is
basically this on that big ass duffel
bag so I'm like this is so perfect you
know cuz I finally get my six match that
was my point this Barbie Jackie don't
match this but it's pretty fucking
whimsical so whatever that's not beside
the point okay so I'm like okay I'm
gonna get everything to match I'm pissed
off because my fucking luggage don't
match
first off second of all they shouldn't
have that like and it's an automatic bid
that's the thing is I don't think it was
even a fucking person I think they had
to have like that rights reserved shit
where they can put a price and you can't
see the prices you have to keep bidding
until you meet that or more that type of
shit and then relist of the item and
today get the money that they want which
is just fucking stupid my bitch today so
I'm just so over eBay like I'm over
bidding for shit like if this shit
doesn't say
right now I think I'm just fucking over
it if anybody sees the fucking duffel
bag and this monogram don't you buy it
easier talking about somebody you know I
mean I like this table don't do that to
me if you find it and you buy for
yourself I mean fucking tell me
seriously don't tell me cuz that's not
right and you are being rude so I if you
see the monogram like this in this
fucking size then let me know because I
cannot find the bag I haven't been able
to find it for like two three years I
mean it's just pissing me off because
the one chance I had the fucking unity
even wants to be a stupid bitch and not
give me what the fuck I deserved so
excuse me for having a tantrum right now
I can't even do my eyebrows because I
was so motherfucking upset that's why I
should cut over there
so yeah I I hate you BAE
I fucking hate I hate everything about
eBay like I hate you baby like people
that hate fucking Apple in fucking
iTunes
I hate eBay because they are there and
this is not the first time this has
happened to me this is not the first
time this has happened to other people
that I know I'm hurt I'm really fucking
hurt so yeah off of that uh-oh
my hair is acting stupid I'm gonna put
this in a ponytail and it's not the hair
it's just
my shower was just not buffering the day
and did she got poofy so yeah and I was
opposed to do videos today for my
attitude right now it's just not that
some other shit going on too right now
with me as far as production is
concerned with if you guys didn't know I
did a a short film called whiskey girls
and that short film is now being turned
into a webseries so if you want to watch
it the link is below so you can watch it
and yeah I'm just a little irritated
with some other things too so yeah um
that's about it my mother goes to Pitt
boys and get some tires from my car they
having a sale and um yeah I'm gonna try
to cheer up today and I know a lot of
you guys are gonna ask me did you hear
about Moriah and Nikki yes I watched the
video and she
was cutting the fuck up nigga got a
problem but what I will say is this and
y'all know I am NOT teen minaj worth a
damn but the way she was going on sounds
like some other shit had popped off to
either throughout the day or just
throughout this entire experience and
she was kind of fed up because I act
like that too when somebody has just
gotten under my skin and you just let
them have it so it just seems like it's
a little deeper then what people are
saying I don't know I might do a topic a
video about this topic I really don't
know I honestly don't care about either
one of them so who cares so yeah that's
my rant for today I'm just pissed the
fuck off I fucking hate eBay fuck you
eBay bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
