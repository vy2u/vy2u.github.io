that I've been wanting to talk about for
probably like the last month and because
everything is so hectic and I'm doing so
much I haven't had time to sit down and
really do it until now now you guys know
I have Facebook and Twitter which is at
Malibu Dollface and facebook-dot-com
forward-slash multiple dog face and I
see a lot of you guys I got a lot of
followers I got a lot of friends on you
know each side whatever so I see a lot
and I don't say much but I do see a lot
and what I've noticed probably since the
summer started but it was a little bit
before the summer but since the summer
started I've seen this a lot people get
on these social network sites and
everything is fuck love that's just
that's just just just fuck love I don't
understand what it's like what they love
do to you so this video is gonna be
called fuck love are you mad and the
reason for that is because a lot of you
guys are blaming the wrong things on
things that you've done to yourself or
some other people have done but you're
blaming the wrong person when I person
but things really if you could say which
is love now to use the term fuck love
will be that love had to do something to
you
correct um no love is an emotion that is
something that we all have that is
something that we all exude um unless
you're Hannibal Lecter or Jeffrey Dahmer
I don't think that you necessarily don't
feel love towards something or someone
or Casey Anthony um but other than that
those people I think that you've
experienced that are you into it I
understand that people deal with things
in different situations I understand
that people hurt they go through things
and they have situations that they go
through in it we all get through those
things differently but I don't feel that
saying these things or getting on these
social networks and you see someone
that's happy you're willing to beat it
down or everybody's very shallow and you
know it's all about what someone looks
like if they're not cute they're not
worth their time and it's the thing that
I see all the time is like
you get up on Facebook you get up on
Twitter and you keep typing the same
shit about the same type of individuals
over and over and over again but getting
still you keep going back to the same
people over and over and over again so
it's one of two things either you don't
know better like you just don't know any
better
so what you should do or you like it
it's one of the two because it can't be
anything else when people say all Jews
are the same all females are the same no
all the type that you like and seem to
attract are the same that's the
difference
you can't group one gender with a whole
gender you can't group one individual
because they have a penis or vagina with
everybody that's the same difference
that doesn't work because you're not
giving other people a chance and then
people today they don't date I mean
that's the thing I can understand
because it's really hard to get to know
people these days I get it
but if you don't try you're not gonna
know you know and you guys need to stop
being so afraid to tell someone I'm not
sleeping with you on the first night so
what we gonna do you know don't be
afraid to say that because that lets
them know what's not gonna go down if
you sit up there and you're scared and
you don't know what to say and you go on
this date and you feel pressure to do it
you do it and you feel back the next
morning that's your fault cuz you're an
adult you're consenting adults and you
can say no okay you can say no they're
not your parents and just because they
spent five fifty on a movie and cuz
y'all was a matinee or because you know
they drove you there and you feel like
you owe them something it shouldn't be
your genitals pull out 20 bucks and say
thank you for a good night goodbye and
let that be what it is be your own
independent individual that's how I feel
like the situation is so you know but
that's a different story but don't be
afraid to get to know people because
when you black people out you block one
opportunities out and you block
opportunities to see someone way past to
you I mean there's a lot of people that
I'm dated that I never had sex
do you guys get what I'm saying there's
a big difference we never got to that
point we went on a few dates we kicked
it
we had fun it was cool but that was a
you know so I think that's what people
have to understand is it doesn't always
have to lead to fix it don't have to go
that route if you don't want it to but
back to the subject at hand you guys
need to learn not all of you because a
lot of you guys when I speak about
certain things on Twitter or Facebook or
whatever you know with then I see other
people who say things about all my
excess calling me or I don't feel like
dealing with dudes because they all the
same and every dude cheese every female
chick no that's not true because myself
I've never cheated ever in my life I've
been cheated on but I've never cheated
and I never feel it's necessary
I think it's childish and if I don't
want to be with you I'm let you know
that I want if I'm having issues with
you the last thing I want to do is go
and have sex with someone it what is
that gonna do what the problem is still
there I just boned someone else because
of what I was bored or you're not
available or no you took that
frustration that you have with that
person out in some makeup sex for them
that's what you do that's the smart
thing to do okay the smart thing now I'm
gonna tell you no dumb shit but I'm just
sick and tired of seeing people with
this whole fu attitude towards getting
to know people I think people need to
understand that you can be as
independent as you want a lot of people
in the gay community because there is
just a lot of holes I'm going on in the
gay community like all communities it's
just fairly small and but this is really
small so everybody's in slept with
pretty much everybody unless you
teetering outside of that which is DL
whatever the situation is down low or
I'm where am I going with this curious
type situation that just don't mingle in
the same circle or it could you simply
be someone who's gay who's just not
insane and don't do that they they don't
knew he would it is my own business you
know but which is rare because people
have
and most people I know have a certain
type and they won't date outside their
time but let me tell you something
though type that you want is not always
the type that's for you it's okay it's a
give-and-take thing okay most people I
see this all you ever care about what
kind of car I got what do you look like
what did you in this and when your
checklist looks like this you get X X X
for everything else on the other side of
the list so all the outer appearance is
correct but the inner shit
the incidentally I mean infidelity
infidelity and all of that shit is on
this list and they do this shit so you
have it's a give-and-take okay he can't
be a perfect ten and you want this
because you yo fucking owe
penny-pinching ass ain't no ten you
don't need your dirt too so you have to
you can't expect lemonade if you
throwing lemons at somebody else it just
don't work this you give it or it don't
work learn to compromise learn to be a
smart individual when it comes to dating
people and you will not have these
issues I'm not saying that it's going to
completely stop because somebody can
deceive you and lie to you tomorrow that
tells you these things and a lot of you
guys are bruised battered and hurt
because of shit that happened in your
last relationships but I'm here to tell
you something it does not matter get the
fuck over it you bitter ass bitch get
over it if ray ray cheated on you three
months ago
then that's Ray Ray's issue and you need
to move the fuck on Shaniqua and get on
with your life Kelly has been cheated on
you with yo sister then yo blood is
thicker than water and you know sister
need to talk that shit out and y'all
need to forget about him because he is
what he okay I'm not saying that it's
gonna be an overnight thing I'm not
saying this but I'm saying every day
should be a step to getting past this
you keep on rehashing which is on
Twitter and Facebook about what happened
to you way back when Mitchell
you can go go - fuck forward can you
move the fuck up in a line please you
are just sitting talking about the same
shit moving your life is a journey but
you're standing still if it's a one
fucking place just standing there I'm
just I mean he just leave him alone okay
leave him alone and you guys need to
understand when someone does you wrong
being spiteful it's not the answer there
are people who've done me wrong
shit T fucked up just a gutter buck
why did you like but you know what it's
the type of person I know I am a very
headstrong individual but what I never
do and I'm telling you I never seek
revenge on anybody because you know what
that thing called karma is very real
okay and it's gonna they ass back better
than you ever could think in your little
mind to do and it's gonna fuck them up
so bad it's like I got my satisfaction
and my satisfaction is even so good that
I didn't even have to be part of it I
just heard about it like damn I wish you
the best it ain't got nothing to do with
you that in ain't not content enjoying
that because I've moved forward that's
the thing I'm not letting what was
fucked me up and that's a lot of y'all
problems I'm independent I'm doing what
I wanted to I don't need no man I don't
need no female to do it for me that I
can do for my motherfucking self and
that it that it true indeed this is true
you don't need nobody to validate you
but at the end of the day what you gonna
be alone 50 cats and 15 you gonna still
be or at 65 you gonna still be at the
club trying to find somebody trying to
grind up on somebody what you're gonna
do you like need to start thinking about
the long run that's what you need to do
and you need to learn that when you
leave this earth you do leave alone but
you don't want to be on this earth alone
that's the difference between you and I
okay I understand that it's okay to be
hurt it's okay to be leery of certain
people and certain things but to just
cut yourself completely
from an individual or individuals to get
to know them not even on those sexual
stuff none just to know them just to get
to you know go out and have fun in life
you know it's a good thing it's a
healthy thing these are things that you
should do cuz y'all might not be messing
around as a couple but you guys may be
good friends you guys may have something
in common that you don't have been
coming with your friends you know and if
that's okay you know he may tell you
some things she may tell you some things
that you want to get to know you guys
might have a common interest that you
and your friends don't have you never
know but if you don't even try how would
you I see people I was under somebody
that did this I wish I know somebody
that did that but which you ain't even
allowing nobody to do shit for you or
I'll even get to know you because you so
closed off and bitter from what the fuck
TJ did to you ten years ago it's right
and y'all kill me with this fuck love
shit fuck love I got let me tell you
something who you didn't fuck was love
who you fucked was Johnny who you fucked
was Ashley who you fucked was Brittany
that's who you should be saying fuck you
too could love didn't do nothing loveth
any emotion okay it's part of us and we
all experience it so love is here
whether you like it or not so deal with
it
who doesn't have to be here are the
people who fucked you over
so that's who you should direct that
anger towards okay that's the problem
and a lot of you guys I see it so it
comes from a hateful place it's I mean
you guys are hurt and I understand cuz
I've been hurt and I've been down this
road before where I just I mean nobody
I'm gonna do my thing and that is it but
you know what like it's lonely okay and
you see your friends progressing they're
doing stuff they're happy as hell
they're going through you know I'm
saying just that good feeling when you
actually find somebody who completes you
and you don't have that it's hurtful but
you don't always have to be like that
you'll have to stay like that unless you
choose to be okay so guys understand
in it let shit go let it be what it is
and become a bigger and better person
okay
and I know and I like I said before I
know it's not easy it's gonna take
practice it's gonna like I told you guys
in a previous video I got trust issues
you know everybody comes with their own
little set of baggage that they go
through from past shit but what you
don't want to do is you don't want to
take that baggage and start unpacking
that on somebody who wasn't even there
they don't know what's in that bag you
know and that's unfair to them and what
you do is you turn them off they don't
want to do what you don't want to talk
to you they think you're weird you know
anything is just like no I would never
set you up with none of my friends we
wouldn't be talking we wouldn't be cool
we would mean none of that cuz you got
problems that you need to solve and a
lot of you guys got underlining issues
whether it's parent issues relationship
issues emotional issues whatever it is
you need to learn figure that out before
you decide that you want to go off and
venture into doing other things with
other people because if you keep on that
the right that you're going you're gonna
still be at the standstill if you keep
messing with the same people you're
gonna get the same results if you keep
on feeling the way you feel you're gonna
get more deep into depression and you're
gonna be very very bitter and before you
look up you're gonna be 60 60 70 years
old man ain't no more dating at that
point I just want to let you know ain't
no more dating at 60 and 70 life is
about to come to a close okay the last
thing you need to be doing is getting
married at 85 because she was bitter for
85 previous years that don't work that
ain't hot we ain't doing that okay so if
you watching this video right now and
and somebody done broke your heart then
you leave that shit in a shoe box in
your closet and you get up you refresh
yourself if you want to cry cry it's
okay and we all cry I cry like the next
person we all do it it's okay whatever
the situation is let that shit go and
and just have a moment to yourself or
whatever and when you see them just be
the bigger person go to them say what's
up how you doing yeah I'm saying just
let that ride because it's gonna hurt
them to know that
let's something so great go and that's
the thing that we all have to realize is
that when you let the courses of
whatever the situation is take their
course you'll be good you know but just
be a better person be a healthier person
be a happier person you know and you'll
go far
I promise you I'm not lying to you you
will definitely go far but all of this
bitter shit has got to stop I'm an
advocate for non bitterness for real
though because it's just reading it's
rapid rains like it no matter who you
are you have feelings and they do get
hurt don't act like things don't hurt
you because when you try to act tough
you look weak that's period cry if you
have to like I said cry if we should I
do you want to do it by yourself do play
something you want to do while I'm
talking right now do i I'm listening I'm
feeling you I understand what you're
going through
yeah nobody would ever understand the
hurt in the pain that I've been through
and and you know with relationships like
I've been through the wringer for real
but I'm still a happy person I'm still
pushing through and I'm still meeting
great individuals in my life and that's
the great thing that I I feel good about
as an adult now it's because I can sit
back and say you know what man I was
going through it but I'm good now you
somebody else's problem and you going
about your business let me what it is
who cares you know
so yeah I hope this video helped you
