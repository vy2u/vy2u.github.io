Saturday everybody um but I'm come to
you guys what an earlier video that I
planned on doing due to simple fact that
this morning most of you guys like
myself found out that singer Amy
Winehouse passed away at 27 years old
and I must say it saddens me that she's
gone because she rather you agree with
my assessment of her as a person or not
I still think that she was a great
artist and I loved her first album I
didn't know until today she actually had
the second album but I really loved Amy
um Amy's music now some people you know
we leave we lose people all the time you
know that's just that's inevitable and
the reason why I called this video
falling stars is because the simple fact
that we lose people often quicker than
we plan on and if we're not necessarily
playing but you never plan on losing
nobody but earlier did you expect it she
was only 27 um as you guys know this
year will mark aaliyah's um 10th
anniversary of her death which was
August when fifth and you guys know I am
a huge Aaliyah fan no matter hence the
hair no matter how you spin it that is
my hair inspiration for the rest of my
life because Herrera was always done
which is not even that just as a great
person in an inspiration to other people
she's definitely through her music held
me you know just like a lot of our other
artists that I love also we just
recently lost with handlers husband who
was actually the co-founder of Mateo and
Barbie he died at 95 the other day so
yeah you know it's just Ruth handler the
creator of her asthma in the past away
um but you know we lose people he I mean
he lived a full life you know that's
understandable Amy other hand did not
and it's that but it's added me even
more that on Twitter and Facebook people
are making jokes or cracking jokes about
someone's child who's no longer here you
know whether you agree with how she
lived
her life whether you agree with the drug
of choice use whether you like her music
are you don't it's still just
disrespectful when I hear people talk
about the deceased like they're just
nothing you know it's just like I have
an opinion about a lot of stuff but what
I will say is I do not like to hear
people disrespect the deceased because
they're not here to defend themself you
know no matter what the situation may be
just it just it saddens me that as a
society feel like that that's okay like
oh she's dead so what so what's next
who's follow friday you know it just
it's just like wow I'm not asking you to
um just go on and on about it or you
know feel bad about it because you
didn't know where personally but it
still does not negate the fact that
she's a human being that was here that
was living I was born that was from
parents you know that type of situation
you know you guys have to understand and
not everybody did this but it was a few
people on Twitter who felt the need to
just be very disrespectful at that point
in time and say very unnecessary things
in regards to her and her passing um
another person that I've heard people
just you know and if people had opinions
about this too when they said that Osama
bin Laden was dead now although he was a
bad man they say and he did this and he
did that and it was evident that he did
do this and he did do that it still you
don't celebrate death that's I think
that's what I'm trying to get at you
don't celebrate people's def you
celebrate their life you know although
he was a man who where the letter should
going on and he did a lot of unsavory
things to a lot of people it still
doesn't give you the right to celebrate
his demise if that makes any sense you
know and a lot of this comes from people
who believe in certain beliefs which I'm
not going to even go there with in this
video but they believe in certain things
and but they don't practice what they
preach you know you know you're you know
you don't practice which craziness it's
just disrespectful respect the people
who are not here respect the fact that
they may
not so great choices in their life you
know let's just we put it like that not
so great choices because from a
individual like myself I grew up in
inner city a lot of people that are grew
up with are now drug addict so a lot of
people that I seen that were older than
me coming up now do drugs now and
although it's sad to see I don't judge
them because that's something that they
personally are going through and they
are bad on the way anybody who knows
anything about addiction knows the fact
that that's not something that just is a
fly-by-night individual type thing this
this happens to a lot of people in the
world where they get addicted to these
things and I think one hit is not going
to do nothing in 20 years later they're
still doing the same stuff so remember
that this is the ongoing battle drug
addicts are like us with food when we
get hard we have cravings for food they
crave drugs they crave heroin they crave
weed they crave and and I don't want to
hear nobody talk weaving weeding a drug
bitch is a drug because you can't get a
job if you smoke that shit so yes it's a
drug call it what you want but only your
drug you would say some shit like this
so wash your comments below but other
than that I mean I just wanted to come
to you guys real quick and state that
fact like just watch what you say about
people and watch things that you make
fun of because you never know who's is
oh you never know when that could be you
and you want somebody to take pity upon
you or feel where you coming from our
family member or your kids one day just
remember that okay because karma is a
bitch and it's very real and it will so
come back on you and it's gonna come
back on you know where you ain't gonna
never forget so remember that to watch
what you say about certain people and
the things that they do this is not just
about Amy this is just about celebrities
I don't know why people give celebrities
you put him on a pedestal then you beat
them down then when something happens to
them you feel like it's a mockery like
these are ended these are humans okay
they eat
and shit just like you they have
families they go through stuff you know
everybody just because you're in the
limelight that doesn't mean that all
things that are bad are now no longer
going to affect you or no there are more
drug addicts in a music industry than
there are on the streets there is just
something and some things that certain
people do that they live to regret and
we are not here to beat them down or
judge them based on that we're here to
uplift them and help them through it and
I think it was more people helping amy
to her situation her sobriety she
probably would still be here you know if
it wasn't so many people tell her well
you know people don't take you seriously
because you're a drug addict or you know
that people don't do this you know we're
still used as a society to beat each
other down to the point where it's like
what's the point of me even trying they
don't take me seriously they don't care
I don't care so what's the point what's
why you know is that type of situation
and we need to learn how to support each
other and stop disrespecting certain
people I come on here and I talk about
Beyonce Nicki Minaj all of these people
but at the end of the day I still give
them props where they're not gonna feel
if they do come across one of these
videos that I just totally hate their
goods rather my opinion or anybody else
opinion on internet matters I still give
props to those who deserve it some
people just simply the bitch is horrible
she's gonna die you know like I've seen
people just say disrespectful things
about Michael about Elvis about um about
to say Cyndi Lauper sending lover is a
lot of occasions shout out to Cindy um
Marilyn Monroe Anna Nicole Smith all of
these people who have passed away
Dorothy Dandridge all these people have
passed away through from drugs you know
drugs whether there were inflicted drugs
George de Troyes whatever the situation
is these people have passed away from
drugs and people feel the need to make
fun of it like it's just okay and we got
to learn you guys it's not always
fighting games because the very person
that you make fun of you could be in
their City
question one day it's okay to make if
you make it a joke about somebody's
record sales you know Sierra you know
like that you know it Sierra hurting
right now Sierra's in la getting
photographed by everybody on kitchen
Boulevard she's good but I would never
make fun or think it was okay to make
fun of the fact that Bobby Brown has
been through you know I call Whitney
Houston a crackhead all the time the
reason being is because i feel that
Whitney is so above that you know and
it's just I mean it's not correcting
what I'm doing neither I will not sit up
here and try to defend myself if not
correcting what I do neither and I need
to work on that but I'm human just like
the next person and that's the reason
for me doing this video but i think it
people were just not not even just us
because it's just only so much as the
audience that we can do wait this video
like i said before any won't change the
world but there's only so much as people
that we can do but it's just people
within their circle that needs to Connor
say you know where that's not
necessarily the best thing for you to do
at this point in time you never sent or
maybe you should get some help you know
some people are just enabler and they
want to get a cut of what they want to
get up and then it is what it is you
know so yeah just when people die show
some remorse because somebody on your
family's gonna die one day you're gonna
die one day and even if you make not the
best decisions in your life you don't
want people disrespecting you when
you're longing on you're not even here
no more body is cold as ever you know so
just you guys watch what you do you
watch what you say because you never
know how it can come back to you okay
and on that note I'm about to go get
dressed or I can go out and stuff and I
gotta get my eyebrows done yeah
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
