video which is my favorite albums from
the early 2000s okay like my top 10
favorite from the early 2000 okay
so we're going to start off with number
one since this was represented by my
girl Ginny G from before dark it is
before dark album daydreaming now okay
a little backstory when before dark came
out I knew what of them but I wasn't
really too familiar with them I didn't
even know that they lived in LA but a
lot of my friends at the time was like
oh yeah they got holidays I was like
okay and um one of my friends at the
timing Chris was actually in of was in
school he was a thing two of them with
the girl Mia who the liar skin girl and
the short went in the room it was I
giving up the same last name so we said
each other throughout his classes I'm
like okay I'll buy their album got the
album in the literally change my life
like when I tell you okay the and summer
think I was in a seventh grade if I'm
going to take it and IRA listen to this
out all day long my favorite tracks Mar
the intro I love of course how could you
it's a cool song I'm a favorite but I
know the words Monica of course
consensus singles as far as they know
Jam baby be sure in so late it's the
first time I had ever seen so like and
another funny story is that Omarion and
Mia would compromise together and on
Mario the first time I ever had ever
seen him was in this video so you look
at before dark
baby featuring so like he's in the video
he plays the love interest
and yes very short hair no braids always
online is legit my second favorite song
on this album come correct
blood gem she push and shove
okay so daydream is my favorite I'll
come to my favorite song on the album
series that song I don't know who penned
it but whoever did it and I'm still like
it's like um LaShawn Daniels you know
what Sean he is mean with a pig a man if
your little shot he was on time or
events but say what you want he got that
heat honey so I love this album to death
shout out said before all the girls are
doing great Mia is a mom of two now a
Rica is a dancer she went into my home
video she's been is like everything and
then Ginny Jean actually was one of the
head writers on the game from start to
finish about theory so they also get a
coin okay so the next album that I love
from this decade well this arrow was
black album black black was one of those
groups that I love because they were
like TLC but yet so different and of
course Lisa knew exactly what she was
doing with this was I thought oh great
she album I if the only light on that
ever was released to the public follow
like everywhere the black house I don't
even get it like a release relief and
then it was another one I think we call
it biography I don't think no no really
see there it's all black album cover
I would love to redo that ok I need like
two other youtubers that are guys I want
to get into the good old copy outfits
with me so we can a real cute like okay
so I really I remember one me my sister
I used to have like these big ass
coaches went out and come out see the
put on the telephone poles and he's a
big one together take him down and take
one I remember had just a child girl
anyway um this album my favorite song if
I have to pick in probably rain rainbows
ride and it's not about being gay Oh
what is my gym and then Lenny is also
another another song that I love on this
I'm the height to release me release me
with one of those songs that I love
until I figure out Carl Thomas and
little Zayn have the same beat but ever
produced that ain't
the next album from this era that I
really love which was Isis this one a
girl group Isis album which came out in
2001 which is called the way we do and
this to this day it's still one of my
favorite a matter of fact let's undo the
ISIS video as an intro I had a pink
background yes girl um but this album
was just like Oh
Kiera wherever you are girl I not used
on TV margins of the fastest place on
our business goals I think that's it is
gay song to the warmest place she was
the lead singer of that at that
particular group end and of course um
lamai good with Meghan good sister was
in a group and it was two other young
ladies and it was a great album for me
my favorite song okay this will be our -
one of my favorite songs is almost you
didn't because I just feel like that
situation I can relate to at the time I
just like the song because it was just
ghetto and I could get him but then now
they go through stuff is Oh make sense
so yeah oh no she didn't
hater Jam but my favorite true me
because I can't really pick - I like the
most so I will say message to you and
beautiful you or my two favorites and I
think I think with the exception of
black before our album kandi wrote on
that I can kandi wrote on this out move
this bird's got she got a long resume -
she's okay so yeah I love his on the
does it was still it still all these I'm
running there so I'm gonna play today
okay so the next album that I love to
death that was a from the early 2000s
and y'all got to be like what was the
why do fools fall in love soundtrack and
I know I'm a listen its explanation that
needs to be and I will give it to you
but let me tell you something Missy and
Timberland are absolutely beast when it
comes to having some things their way
and when they do something they do it
very well
okay
so how I figured out about this
soundtrack by itself was the fact that
destiny shall have a song called get on
the bus and 20 story about this as well
get on the bus was up obviously are
produced by Timberland and he's only
featured on a song but what I didn't
know until recently was alia actually
helped him with that very terrible
choreography oh come on what is it not
exactly Beyonce's best situation but
it's a nice intuition is my jam though
like I love this song to death no matter
what get on the bus with my jam but the
entire outliving be on the bus it was no
more food which was an invoke song my
jam coming getting contact featuring
Busta Rhymes and Missy is my favorite
already I was about you know the words
um five minutes which was little more
and I was older glad you liked the song
and it had Beatles and Irish dad green
Beatles in this video it was Beatle
central ok you know where my exception
comes from because this is a pitiful
part of my life as far as music is
concerned okay so mr. about you Jam
Nicole red without you Jam I'll
follow math one on there and then they
have song by next called slash and I
remember knowing all the words and not
known as the subject matter of this song
was until I got older and I should not
have been singing this and then my
favorite track on this album besides get
on the bus is Mel be featuring Missy
Elliott I think I want you back
I think it's you back I remember the
video and it was like green and
everything but a honorable mention on
this album that's one of my favorite
tracks is what's the dilly-o featuring
total don't you guys remember last year
sometime I did a bob for um RPG show and
I had this like sequence jacket on that
was a song that was you and I was very
like I love anything total so it doesn't
matter you know so the next album from
the early 2000s that I love today is
Britney Spears is Brittany okay guys I
am before asking me that common little
girl shut up - for real
hey DOM hi when I first heard the beat
drop first late for you I just knew that
this my jam' you know you hear like
three seconds this is my jam big
I don't care what you talk about he can
call me all types of niggas out here
this not jail so knowing that Pharrell
did the beat which I've had the biggest
crush on frozen chicken ass so there you
go but no this album was very different
from hitting middle number time and the
second time was except it was I did it
again
this was more of a mature bringing this
wasn't sad I hate this long and I'm
afraid that - so thank God she don't do
them to her but um yeah this album was
definitely my jam but my favorite song
on your and funny I actually learned to
like this album watching Britney which I
still feel it's her best tour ever which
was a dream within a dream to work and I
learned all these loans I didn't get the
Apple in the first well I got when the
first came out I didn't listen to
everything so watching this on HBO 50
million times I was like something any
long I think I kind of like these on but
my favorite song on here would it is
called what it's like to be me which I
believe Justin Timberlake actually did
which was the jam so the next album that
was one of my favorite of the early
2000s which was market Houston's mhm and
guys know I love me some immature and I
was very sad to find out if they were
not even really Melanie more to this and
their last I was caught in and he was
called
IMX which is been one of my favorites
because that's pillow girl if you ain't
never heard I am it still oh you need to
go Google that okay and I just I so I
didn't think Marcus was gonna do great
by himself
but I bought the album because I think
he was focused on my life
2001 September 11 like that was just
are over dude I think Mariah Carey got
that for glitter girl you know how to
turned out even though I like always say
I like glitter but it got pushed back
and long get there first
and then it turned into September and
then it just came out oh I was over came
out boys of summer left out a row but it
was kind of like a slow release nobody
said anything about it but my minds are
actually still in love with Marcus as a
solo artist Ernest album not so much
unlike other albums but this is like
definitely my favorite um my favorite
and of of Marcus's body of work I think
this is his best to me you know this is
when bondage was popping so you know we
go with this oh so the next album on my
list is anubias and nithya now I know
you're doodle individual is so not
random I had to see between this
complicated and it's kind of folks
because they pulled bomb but like I said
you guys in my other review I'm not a
really big fan of are killing however
I'm a big fan of our killers writing I
like when he does songs for other people
just my news is that's a whole line and
I heard Lindsey I heard of his album I
think before I came out it was just yeah
it kind of just creeped out on me but um
I thought this album was amazing I
thought Nivea's whoa I didn't know she
could sing like that and that was the
thing that and run it to my was kind of
Genesis singers who actually have vocal
range and I was in love and she is
everything right her hair was like if
you live in human owners or whole year
ago she was doggone mmm maybe he was one
of colors it was a southern thing so I
understood now why it was good I was I
wanted to go he's cozy you know like the
molle what a long piece in the back I'm
the one talking with three ponytails but
okay I just think this album is amazing
my favorite song on this album is not 25
reasons it's a nice song but it's a good
song it's that one song that everybody
not on their mix CDs my favorite song is
you don't know featuring feature in the
Canon I don't know why I just
the wedge acedia and if I work I don't
know but she the government says I miss
unity I fear a call or Instagram photo
she's up to she has like CPUs except
she's released but I miss me I miss this
Nivea before the key is Nivea so the
next album on this list is thrill w3 o w
I remember getting this album and
literally going crazy are we relying at
school oh we're gonna go back she's a
good all young days I remember telling
everybody at school that Kimmy was my
cousin don't know why but I love the
group that much in our heart like I said
y'all remember the box right I remember
when it was a new joint whenever I got a
tape somewhere I got a VHS tape
somewhere with that new joint on it
okay I'm gonna find it and show y'all
because I was really about my music
get in there um but this album was the
album that I've seen three different
girls I didn't see what I kind of seen
in a lot of other groups where you kind
of say oh she's the lead singer and it's
the rest of the growth they all did
something even though people want to
shake Mussoorie
she did something in the room and she
definitely left a nice secondary vocal
to Adrienne and kiwi similar situation
dude but she was a great kid rapper okay
I do remember the plastic bTW interview
where she said her and Bao well were
like boo-boos and he was like girls and
group singing here we go for each other
know I have to kind of lump this with
the second album which was a broken Mac
this is the time when the story was hit
with the two-piece and kicked out the
group and down they kind of continued as
2lw and I think they thought it was
going to say has the same effect as
Destiny's Child did when the copy Latoya
had replaced in the group and it just
kind of kept going but it has to
opposite like nobody brought the album
they ended up getting I believe drop
from your label and a girl came back in
this amazing album and it's they're the
same as far as my favorites on the album
but they're very different because the
girl came back is definitely more
grown-up then throw W my favorite album
on 300w is I mean my favorite song
Montreal WI believe is I wasn't getting
some heavy my Adrienne is at least okay
that girl can sing her face off
and I don't know why she is just fit
anything but hey it's not something to
understand she gave me some body music
some puzzlers um my favorite song when a
broken math you crazy
I just I don't know why it just a
beautiful song it's a beautifully
written song it's a beautifully sung
song then they both share it which i
think is amazing about you know so the
next album on this list is fiscals
unleash the dragon said i know broken
would be very happy to hear this oh i'm
girl this this disco album was kind of
like uh sure's confession for him though
like i don't know nobody who didn't have
this album you know like everybody I
think everybody in a mama had this album
everybody has his own and back story so
I was in love I think I was hungry and
there was a boy who went to my school
name and he was in my up in you as a
month fifty reflows and we sat next to
each other he was really cool he was one
of the little popular boys at school all
the girls thought he was cute I did too
oh there's a song I don't know how old I
was at the time but there was a song on
this album called so sexual that just
reminded me of him I'm sure he got kids
now but he would play with cold oh and I
think that's right but really why I like
them in a song kind of meant something
even though I wasn't taking it as like I
wanted to jump you're born I don't even
know what that
yet so it was just more so like I have
this connection with you that I feel
this way so this song reminds me of you
know I don't think about the memo but so
sexual is it's my favorite song and
unlike the dragon is it just a bomb song
wait do I have to grab the back of your
neck that's got to get it okay okay
seven other words where we live music
okay so the next album is Justin
Timberlake justified and I'ma justify
this because Timberland again
did dad okay and I thought this problem
was a great representation of Justin as
a solo artist away from anything I think
that were you're in a group for a long
time people think that you can only
stand with a group and for some people
that's what it is
hence jay-z hence Nicole sure-sure
burger they can't really do anything
outside of the group that people want to
hear we only want to kill you when it's
other people that are backing you and
you're the lead not just you
so I thought that that justified was
literally it's still my favorite Justin
I'll miss Maestas
again it's kind of like Cisco and marki
juicers albums it's their body of work
at that time it was at bondage area area
era where everything was great but the
great thing about this album of the fact
that Timberland and Pharrell were
helping Justin out in it so it was like
telling who bomb first let me go one
sexy who look like a bomb
ass black version of Stuart Little
I was mash but you also have like the
big Chain darling like who what oh I
have a list I cry me a river even though
it was about Brittany some kind of
Britney take you from here I doesn't
first song about Herman town that wasn't
a single Mel's like okay I like that
though
and then nothing else and let's take a
ride
I submit Colorado that I love itself it
was just in what I mean like you know
the thing about this is like bittersweet
is that that was just a time it was a
period as you can see my hair don't do
it guys
it was a time period that you miss which
you don't really want to mess with
because it was for the time it was you
know you don't want nothing up and the
last album on this list
it's Fergie's of the Duchess and I love
this album um if you guys ever played
The Sims but I mean the Sims the herbs
systems in a city you guys know that the
black eye sees were a big part of that
game they were the tagline for that game
everything revolved around them and I
remember specifically getting into
fights with Fergie on purpose trying to
get into the club and we will always end
up in it's like very homoerotic
relationship with habbo I don't know I
didn't try to do that I just know what
the Williams play okay I wasn't
my favorite games later but it was just
one of those things where when she went
against her own really no no Reuben all
is in the London breeches came out and I
didn't like the wrong Joey part I like
with the LA guys out do you do that's
the only part I like a dissolvable then
Park Ellucian came out and I was like
okay I'm first delicious dip I was like
okay then um glamorous came out so don't
everybody
I think I got it I brought there like
the Fergalicious listen I'll come get
the album got the album and literally
lost my mind
my favorite song on this album is the
know megaphone and what's funny about
this is that only perfect show her intro
and we heard sing song was this song but
it was better so if you ever noticed
watching an entire show she always ends
the show it says take it away Fergie and
I was like oh why is she also prefer
like maybe it was different her because
you know what the ditch is Fergie maybe
you know it was pretty but they had to
spend it up for the show because it was
a theme song and then I've come to find
out this is and it slows down and it was
really a song about loving me no matter
what I look like with the makeup without
the makeup without the Loreal and I just
thought it's amazing so these are these
are my favorite album from 2000 to 2005
for short as you guys haven't listened
to any of these albums give them a
chance again
these are moments in time so you have to
kind of go and go in with these with an
open mind just because a lot of these do
sound a they sound like they were made
in 2001 or a particular sound alone at
that time it sounds like that and it's
nothing wrong with that but again if you
are a lover of music especially pop and
army music like I am keep these a chance
honey boo boo oh okay
and I hope you guys did enjoy this um if
you wish I do next like which obvious
I'd like my favorite rap albums I think
that was kind of coming oh yeah I will
catch you guys in my next one again
what is your where were your favorite
albums from 2000 to 2005 you let me know
so you know and I will catch you guys in
my next one
although I think the judges came up 2006
anyway so count</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
