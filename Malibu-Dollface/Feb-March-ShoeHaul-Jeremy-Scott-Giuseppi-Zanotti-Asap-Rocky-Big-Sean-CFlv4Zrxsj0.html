every time I post a pair of shoes on
Instagram people be like you please like
show us a collection of the shoes that
you wear and you buy and what they range
from so I'm gonna do about my top shoes
that I'm like wearing on the regular
basis right now just kind of you know
why not so I'll start with the parent
that I wore on Valentine's Day
and these are my Giuseppe Zanotti these
are the London TR Donna's and Rose they
are a pink a pink crocodile they're not
in the box right now but just so that
you guys know when you guys buy like
shoes that are expensive this is what
you're paying fo you man for all these
down dustbag you paying for all this
extra stuffing you paying for this nice
silk um carry dust bag and in all this
extra damn paper they put these shoes
they always put these shoes in like
really good these boxes and Louboutin
boxes are really well made
like they not show average edita boxes
that's gonna collapse they some good
boxes Oh
to the shoes these are the shoes that I
wore on Valentine's Day you probably
came Hartley's okay these are the shoes
these are the pink um Giuseppe Zanotti
they are not waged although they look
like it but the wedge just that means
you can tell cuz they is the way just
ridiculous um they have the two straps
the one at the top you have the strap
here and then they have this strap here
um with the Giuseppe name here I wish
this was gold like this um and then they
have the two signature zippers on each
side um these were I think 980 I looked
them up I got them as a gift for
Valentine's Day but I did looking with
the CMS because because I did want them
um so I told my look Han
you know Barbie wants some pink I just
said I want some pink giuseppe's I
thought he was gonna give me these are
the ones that they have but
so grateful because I love these a lot
um
buddy look I'm oh I think they're 9 980
I want to say that's what they are and
just a heads up for you guys who are
buying like these shoes always go a size
up and also when there is a strap here
and make sure you get aside like a half
size bigger because this will hurt okay
bad next pair that I have are also just
that B's these are from these are are
they're actually in here extra stuff
damn it
and it's these black and white
Giuseppe's that I had wore to my meet
and greet um I had to put shoe
stretchers in these because they really
hurt when I got them and I was not
trying to send them back because I
needed them but they fit right now but
you guys never seen the commercial about
the stretch genie these things well I
don't know about the little solution
they give you but this actually did work
I got them in my size the problem is
it's just Giuseppe's are very narrow in
like the toe area so they don't fit like
my Louboutins are the same size um I
thought but they're not they have to get
a size bigger in these they're not doing
my Louboutin so I have to get an 8 and
just that B's versus a 7 so yeah kinda
learned my lesson didn't yell because
they kind of hurt um but now they don't
hurt anymore I had to definitely stretch
them and wear them a little bit so they
can give some but I do like these these
have of course the signature zipper just
like these have on the back you have the
zipper as well um and they have the
Guiseppe name in the back and they have
the signature strap but they have the
strap just at the top and they don't
have a bottom strap but I love these
these are actually very comfortable
I think I got these on sale actually
they were there now 870 but I got them
on sale they were 300 and from I don't
know I got them around Christmastime so
they were having like all these flash
deals and stuff like that but I think as
soon as I brought them they went back up
to regular price so yeah the next pair
of shoes that
have and I absolutely adore our even
though the box is ruined
oh my big shine adidas um these are
these were specially made just for Big
Sean um they have like this snakeskin
all the emblems are gold they have the
gold laces they come with a pair of
extra gold shoosh rings but I haven't I
don't think it looks cute with those so
I just keep these in um these are kind
of like shoes that I wear like much is
that means I wear those when I'm like
going somewhere like a club or anything
or something these are the ones I would
like to the mall and stuff like that cuz
you know I'm a Tom girl like I don't
like this what I have on right now is
something that I would wear just came
with a Versace skirt but no so I would
like so um some nice hair and pants or
something like this with this anyway um
these were specially made just for Big
Sean the lace locks that are in here
some of you guys have noticed that my
other white Adidas have the same lace
locks and no this is not the other one
see this I didn't just take one out oh
the shoe fell down there so whatever but
anyway um somebody on ebay actually I
guess they have these and they took them
and then they made a mold in there now
selling them and they feel exactly the
same as these do he's the only
difference is you know my tongues are
not the same this one is just leather
and this one actually has emblem on it
these were very hard to find and when I
buy tennis shoes and stuff like that I
like things that everybody don't have
because I don't like okay because people
got mad at me for saying this I really
don't give a damn but okay they got mad
at me because I said I don't wear
Jordans which I don't I don't buy
Jordans I have Jordans but I don't wear
them um and I don't I don't have any new
ones because these are all the shoes
that I had when I was a kid and just cuz
y'all change the colorway does not mean
that I'm gonna run out and buy them cuz
I don't really see the point you know so
I mean if you like Jordans that's great
but I don't really want to go nowhere
and see seven people in the same shoes
that I have it sucks so back to these um
these were all think I hunt three
hundred and fifty pairs were ever made
which is really hard because I says and
the inside he says I say I'm still
dreaming bigger than I'm living and
inside of there
um just one of his sayings I guess I
don't listen to Big Sean but I think
he's cute and I left him an Ariana
Grande together these are the gold laces
with the gold tips that came with them
um yeah I think I thought these were
great these are in a six and a half yeah
these are six and a half because I did
it to know run bigger so yeah um the
next pair is just all white pair of
Adidas Pro models and they're just like
I mean I gave Big Sean this pretty much
template to work with and I just pretty
much ordered some more lace locks
because these are this is gold and then
this is go to just match those so if I
wanted to just go be a little different
you know there's a pretty simple I think
those were the Big Sean ones when they
came out we're running 150 or 215 and
then those white ones were just think
like 50 bucks or do dollars sound like
that so yeah this will my box look like
now unfortunately the next pair of shoes
are these which are my ID to dark nights
okay so oh these are actually my ID des
ASAP rocky wings so this is what these
look like and you're me Scott has a
perfume coming out based on these you
know I never wore these they still know
at the bottom but I'm gonna um but yeah
I can't wait to that perfume comes out
coming be like yes but these what they
look like these are really dope these
was his collaboration with adidas and um
ASAP rocky these are the straps I mean
they are laces in the back there are the
wings on the side this is like a black
denim material that these are made out
of um and they fit great these are also
a six and a half yeah these are 16 hours
so I love these because when I sit you
know I love these makes that Rocky and
then I also love Jeremy Scott and I
don't have I have some
all black shoes like I have all black
Tim's but I did want something that had
a little spunk to it and I thought these
would be perfect
the
what I usually have with these wings is
that I can't define them in my size I'm
gonna do find my size they are the
colors be too whimsical for all this you
know going on in the back like I don't
want all this to be a color so this was
actually perfect it's neutral but it
still has like texture and stuff in it
so I love these when they came out these
were 215 I've had them since they came
out and so yeah I'm a shoe border last
pair of shoes are another pair of Adidas
and these adidas I sit in line for these
and it's box as big as hell but these
are my Jeremy start journey cart Jeremy
Scott dark knight and these are the
shoes that he have posted on Instagram
around Halloween time and everybody our
singer named Dale had actually posted a
picture in them and people were saying
like oh they're not real they're coming
out as prototypes but they're not real
come to find out they were room um I
wore these shoes one time in the day
that I wore them I was going through
something so horrible so I didn't really
get to enjoy them but these are what
they look like they're very different
looking trust and believe when I tell
you these are not for the faint of heart
you have to have a lot of swag to rocks
inside of the Hedgehog type shoes when
these came out they were 250 as well
that seems to be the price point for
like special edition Adidas and stuff
like that and then the inside of this
little tongue piece actually comes out
of the shoe so it's like a whole
separate Scituate legs dish and then
this is the shoe so you have to put your
foot in here and then slip it in the
shoe which I really don't like um so
Jeremy yeah I didn't quite like that
about this shoe that's probably why I'm
only more than once however when I did
stand in line for them I was going
through something and I just needed some
retail therapy and then when we finally
got in there the guy was like you know
they're only like 12 we only have 12
pairs just so that you know and we only
have we're the only ones inside the
Californian California who have these at
all I was like really so yeah these are
going for like a thousand dollars on
eBay right now if you can find your size
these are in a seven I got a size up
because they didn't have half sizes and
I thought a six might have been too
small which I was right because that
little insole thing is smaller than
actual shoe is oh yeah so those are all
the shoes like right now that I'm just
loving and obsessed with of some I've
wore some I haven't got around to
wearing but yeah for those who are
asking those are pretty much all of the
shoes that um that I love right now and
I have so many more coming and I'm once
I move I'll start doing like more
outfits of the day I wanted to do more
but I just between packing and the space
that I don't have I just can't do it
like I want to so I'll catch you guys in
the next one and I hope you guys enjoyed
