big like the good quality HD camera and
somehow someway the shit got corrupted
and now I don't want to transfer onto
the computer so I can upload it so I'm
have to do this over on my iPad so sorry
about the janky quality you know but
basically just this is about Frank Ocean
and Chris Brown and their little spat
that they have I guess you dead last
night I don't know um and what's going
on with that listen so the story goes
that Chris Brown and Frank Ocean were at
the same studio here in LA last night
and I'm assuming Frank was working on
some music and Chris was working off the
music you know that's to the office I
mean that's what they were doing um
Frank tried to stop Chris from leaving
and he wouldn't move or get out the
doorway or something of that effect that
happened or whatever and words were
exchanged blows were taken and that's
what one source said another unreliable
source basically said y'all know who I'm
talking about but I'm not going to visit
a name said that the reason why this
whole situation went down was because
Frank called Rihanna oh ho to Chris and
Chris just got his incredible hulk on
and just went crazy so I don't know um a
lot of people are saying that Chris um
that Frank's camp and Frank perpetuated
and started the altercation and for once
I'm actually on Christmas side with this
one because usually chris is the one
that's in the wrong but I don't really
honestly think that this time around it
was his it was his fault I i I'm from
what I heard um I don't think that he
had anything to do with this I think
that he definitely probably was evicted
the victim of circumstance and a
basically the police were called and
they said that Chris Brown was going to
be charged for assaulting the alleged
Frank Ocean now the reason why I wanted
to wait to do this video I'm like I
stayed in the one that won't upload that
I don't think that um Chris set out for
this to be something like there's things
in the past that he's done that I would
like he was definitely part of that like
he just seems like the type that was
like we gonna do this and put it out and
give up but this right here I don't
think that he was part of I honestly in
my hearts of hearts believe that he was
honestly just there and some shit went
down and you know I'm future anchor and
Chris Brown don't have the best track
record I think it was last year Frank
Ocean whoa Chris Brown had tweeted Frank
Ocean and said I fucks with Frank Ocean
um you are really talented dude or
something like that and Frank ocean's
reply was I thanks but I don't mess with
due to fuck with that beat women or you
remind me of a young Ike Turner it was
something along those lines and which
was very rude to say and then all of a
sudden it just turned into this big
thing so I think that's where everything
kind of started it manifested from I'm
not sure um but ever since that excuse
me I've noticed that it's been tension
and I thought it was squashed and it was
over but it wasn't now they basically
said that the reason why Frank Ocean was
the alleged victim is because he got his
ass work that's what I'm hearing but you
know on the bad girls club when is two
girls fighting and neither one who can
fight he let them stay but if it's two
girls fighting and one started but the
other one whips her ass the one who
whupped the ass gotta go home I think
that's why he was the alleged victim
because he got his ass whooped allegedly
ok allegedly I don't know if this is
true enough but allegedly so um I just
think that the whole situation
personally for me is just wack because
Chris I think that you should stay as
far as way from day
sure it's possible and if somebody does
try you then just turn the other
motherfucking cheek go smoke some crack
and go about your business and Frank if
you did do what they say you did then
you are just in the wrong as he is
because if you know that this guy is
having such a very hard time in the
industry I don't know not your
responsibility but at least be the
bigger man and just kind of let some
shit fly already with some he said this
is his studio and this is my parking
space and how dare you come here all
this egotistical shit so Frank tweeted
Chris and some dudes jumped me and I
messed up my finger I got some of the
use both hands at the grammy's or
whatever that was basically some grimey
she basically said I'm performing at the
grammys in you ain't are you as you
could say I don't know if Chris
performing or not cuz I like I said I
don't keep up with Chris now i'm not a
fan of Chris because of not because he'd
be Rihanna or because whatever y'all may
possibly think it is I don't like him
because his attitude is bad and he think
he is invincible and he can say and do
whatever the fuck he feels and he'd
never ever taken responsibility or
accountability for things that he excuse
me that he's done so that's the reason
why I don't like Chris Brown I think
he's a great time out to eat you
thinking you dance but he's just not my
cup of tea as far as a person is
concerned I do like Frank Ocean not
because he's gay or bisexual or whatever
the fuck he classified himself as today
I caught him confused ocean because he
don't know which way he wants to go and
if you are bisexual more power to you
all I'm saying is he never clarified it
buddy dear come out and say but not
really with it it was confusing so I
don't know I do like his music I did
play the shit out of channel orange but
I did play Chris Brown songs as well so
I love deuces you know that's much to do
yeah but so I mean it's not necessarily
like I'm picking one side over the other
but in this situation I would say that
either side with Chris due to the simple
fact of the things that I've heard and
the fact that Frank Ocean got on Twitter
and said what he said as if it was a
joke it's kind of like ha everybody's
still picking on you the type situation
so I think it's opera it's just
Hollywood bullshit and this is the shit
that sells records
and this is the shit that people love
all so much so I don't know and honestly
I just don't care because they're both
too talented and have too much money to
be fighting each other like no like if I
had that much money a bitch couldn't say
shit to me about nothing so and I think
with Kris he feels entitled because he
had these little Hoover dudes out here
Hoover is a game for those who don't
know about early game get down that he
pays to basically calling him the clubs
to be his protection you know I'm saying
in these dudes will do anything for a
buck so they're riding around
threatening Frank Ocean and I memory if
you can find it on here on YouTube where
it was threatening him talking about get
out the car and catch fade fade means
fight um you know all of this stuff so
it's think it's it's a buildup of things
in F at some point this was gonna come
to a head I just didn't think it was
gonna be like this like you guys are too
fucking old got too much fucking money
and too much fucking toilet to be
fighting each other in studios looking
like straight great a monkey's just
terrible you are perpetuated what we
know to be a nigga and y'all need to
stop seriously cut the shit out so
that's all I have to say about the
situation I really don't have much to
say sorry about the quality guys but
this is best you gonna get today all
