sorry
me Alice friends always oh my
okay guys listen I have had way too much
fun with this wig I kid you not so a
little bit of a back story on this wig
and I actually have another one too that
I'm going to show you guys so I was on
Instagram
it was either Instagram or YouTube but
this talented ass young lady I seen that
her name was the braid wig Queen now a
lot of you guys know that I wear wigs
religiously that's all I do I do not do
so ends I do not do any I just wear wigs
that's all I ever do so most of the time
when I'm in-between because I'm
literally a new wig pretty much every
day is how I'm rolling these day I I
don't have time to get braids and keep
braids and in I was like well I wonder
if somebody could do a wig now a while
ago I had did a story time I believe or
I mentioned Italian yaki wig that I
reviewed and I said I had a wig but
something happened to it okay so I had a
friend who I asked her to do this and
she said that she could do it and long
story short my wig is missing and I
never got it never got done okay so I
wanted it again but I knew she could
braid super well and the problem that
I've have had with seeing people who do
these wigs is that they don't look
natural they don't look real and I was
afraid that if I went to anybody else
for I try to do anybody else I was going
to end up with that very Whiggish braid
look which I didn't want I wanted to
look like I had a fresh set every time I
stepped out and sometimes normally on my
off days if I am not wearing a wig out
there I'm not going anywhere I just
didn't feel like getting out which is
usually none 9 times of Tim I have on
you know a beanie and I'm dressed down I
don't you know cuz I just sometimes I
just don't feel like dealing with hair
um I don't feel like curling it I feel
like keeping it straight I don't want to
brush with me something so I that's just
usually what I opt for but I was like if
I had a wig a braid wig of some sorts
that I had some nice size on bronze
braids where I could wear the
on a regular basis then I would be happy
and I ran into this chick and she
excuse me uneven color chick she's a
goddess one of the most talented
 that I've ever met in my
life to be able to do this okay so what
happened was we were I seen um I believe
I followed her and if I didn't follow
her she popped up on my popular page or
something like that and I had seen a she
had in a wig and I said it but it had
like a little color in it I think it was
like a looks like a four and I think is
it possible way how much would you
charge for this and black and she hit me
up almost like you know I just you know
I'm a subscriber of yours which I have
seen her in my comments before and she
was like just give me the chance to do
this because I just want you know just
just let me know if you don't like it
it's fine you know I just want this
chance to see if you'll like my work and
from when I seen I already knew I was
down but I was like okay so um what she
did was not this week first she did
another one which was this so she did
this one for me and as you can tell
these braids are a bit smaller than this
so um what she did was she used the
Front's were that she had she bleached
the knots on the frontal hello people
hello she bleached the not on the entire
front so let me get closer and let me
pull this up because y'all have got to
see this okay can you tell I'm excited
Kenya okay so this is the frontal and
all of this she did by hand all of this
look at that
what are you serious like urgh serious
so she did all of this by hand all of
this now this is a full frontal on this
one that I'm wearing as a full wig um
what she does is I guess I believe she
has different options that you can have
so you can have um well I think it's
more I think you I think it's three
options so you can have the one where
it's of a big I believe like illusion
lace or so it's not really lace but it's
a piece that mimic scalp and then you
can have this option which is a full
customized frontal in the back
in the front but in the back it's just a
cap it's a stretchable cap back here
that she literally so that means that
she went individually and berated each
one of these braids and sold them down
to this cap and I will say I was a
little afraid because I was like I don't
know how the back is going to look but
you can tell like you can't tell if you
shake your hair in the back you can't
tell like at all
you can't tell um but as you notice the
one this particular work that I'm
wearing I sent her a wig that I had
which was a um Italian yaki because I
thought okay if it's a mimics African
American hair is going to look more
realistic although this looks very
realistic um and I love the way that she
did the parting and before I get to my
story I love the fact that this one you
can part it here so you can have a
middle part if you want it you could
have a side part on this side or you
could have a side part on this side you
have hel options with this um she I sent
her this wig this was a wig I have
reviewed some time ago and I really
didn't have a reason to have the wig
other than the fact that it was just
laying around um so I send it to her
thinking that it was going to be better
but after she told me she says she had a
hard time which you cannot tell baby she
had no hard time the knots on his puppy
didn't bleach so this is concealer um so
tense y-you can't really see my parts
going this way but don't worry because
when I got photo reasons I'm gonna get
it right um and she said it was just
really dense like she said she likes
someone air the lower density the better
so I don't know if she gives you the
option which I'm sure she should to send
your own wigs in or you could um do the
frontal option or the like illusion lace
option I opted for a I opted for a fool
like you can still see my brave
in-between here like it doesn't stop it
goes back here I wanted you to be able
to see you know if I move my hair that
you can see my braids on the side now
this particular wig that I have
is just our guys to be glued here in the
front because the lace is this kind of
old on this puppy so I didn't roll up in
the fact that it was tension to put the
braids in then it doesn't want to lay
flesh like I would have liked it to but
that was not her issue it was my issue
because it was the wig and it helps
which I had a feeling it was gonna help
if she does have the lace as you can see
the lace is still on this one still um
on here so that means she can pull and
do all that and then you can cut it off
I have tried this one on I just haven't
cut the lace arm off of it and like
actually gossipy glued the front of this
down but you will be seeing this one
because this one when she send it to me
I loved it but they were short they were
shorter than I anticipated and they were
a bit smaller so you can see the size is
um quite the difference and this wig
kind of gives me like um very like I
feel like my aunt would wear her hair
like this and again I'm a hood one okay
so I like the big you know thick ones
not not Cleopatra's they got no idea to
Cleopatra on Instagram and snapchat but
I don't want to Mac thick because I
would have had four but I do like the
fact that they are a bit bigger so these
I feel like Patra you can repair to my
boobs my bumper virtual okay that's what
I'm feeling like with these and I think
hers might have been a little bit bigger
too and these are a bit smaller and err
a bit shorter so this kind of gives me
milli vanilli for me
oh no on a woman this would be you know
nice average nice braids but for me so I
guess I'll just do like a milli vanilli
look or you know I love a thing look um
so I'll do that so once I do that I will
definitely come to you guys with um with
this uh to show you guys what I did with
that look and then I also as you guys
noticed in the beginning to this I
decided to do the militia theme song cuz
you know a little brandy so uh but I
wanted mines are about that long in the
back I didn't want them super long and
girl if you listening I really will
when it's really long but I just wanted
one that came down to like like my
father it's like oh you know but thick
like this but my Theismann she was
saying they are heavy I will say that if
you ever had individuals before they are
heavy so keep that in mind um I have a I
put elastic strap in the back because I
told you the lace on this I couldn't
really glue it all the way down like I
would like to so I had to put a strap in
this one otherwise I would have just
said whatever but because they are heavy
um an extra strap is perfect this one um
I did when I tried it on it was um it
wasn't as heavy it's just one no um and
then because it has a structural cap in
the back it was a little bit different
but if you use a away with a license
track a strap in the back I think you
will be fine oh the great thing that I
love about this option other than the
fact that it's just one of the dopest
things ever is the fact that her
braiding is so consistent and the
problem that I find is a lot of times
when you get people who prey on people
it looks gorgeous but when they have
time to kind of sit back and they're not
kind of up against the clock or you know
they have a person waiting they tend to
get lazy so their braids are very
inconsistent when you look at them hers
are the same throughout the entire head
and I'm super upset but aside from that
this is for people I feel that like
myself I cannot just I can't be embraced
for a week not only can I not want to
just sit and brace for a week um the
painting I do not like how it feels when
I get a fresh pair of even a beehive
it's just uncomfortable and it's heavy
and it's you know it's a lot and you got
to get used to it in your first days
your words day and this eliminates all
that not only does it eliminate the pain
it eliminates having to get them redone
if you are a girl who stays and braids
all the time or you a girl who just did
the big chop and she's now natural and
you are this short and you don't know
like what your option is you don't want
to wear straight hair you still kind of
want to keep the natural look but you
just don't want to go get a loaf a
little jew-fro then you know this is a
great option because not only are you
cut now the pain is a protective style
and you ain't unaware about no new
growth so you don't even have to worry
about getting your hair redone you just
dip the ends and you good you know so I
think this by far exceeds my
expectations of what this wig was going
to be I'm super duper excited I cannot
wait to put that one on and then the one
of the things that I'm most excited more
so about this is that I get to do more
styles that kind of speak true to the
looks sometimes that I'm going for if I
want to go from more of a hood look um
it looks great you know with some red
hair or a straight lead but ain't
nothing like a pair a nice box braids
baby I'm just saying so if you guys are
interested make sure you guys hit her up
I promise you guys it is worth every
single nickel so much so that I haven't
asked her yet
so as you know girl I would like to do a
giveaway where I pay my own money for
two weeks that is four weeks two wigs um
to give away okay so I will pay her
whatever she wants and I'm gonna give
two of these wigs away from my next
giveaway so once this giveaway is over I
want to do this so if you guys are
interested in that type of giveaway make
sure you guys thumbs up at the bottom to
let me know leave a comment and let me
know how do you like these braids
um are you natural you know are you
transitioning from relaxed to natural
you know what what what reason would you
have this ain't the contest you know
this ain't the giveaway so Dom you ain't
got to get deep with it but you know
just let me know and just a side note I
was very scared of this option because I
seen a lot of Oh Trey Zuri I've seen a
lot of those companies do it and the
roots be this loose they look like old
braids they look like some very warrant
and then growth got baby here coming all
down they face Oh before I go
she asked me that I want maybe here on
mines and I told her no for this one so
this little you know this baby here is
actually mines on this one
she actually on this one she actually
left baby hair on it and it was a bit
thicker but I cut it down with some
thinning shears now this is the option
that you have um if you're if you have a
bigger forehead I will go for this
option if you are a person who it's very
sparse edges I would go for this option
if you are a person like me who you have
pretty full edges um I would get it get
it just to be on the safe side and then
cut it down a little bit and then use it
to blend it up with your hair
this one I had none so all the hair that
I have but you also have to remember
when you do get a first prayer a braid
all of your edges around the front are
very tight so it shouldn't be super
duper thick that means that in grip it
right it should be just a little bit so
look like I got you know it looks like
now I just got came back from getting my
hair done when in actuality I just went
in my bathroom included in with the
gossipy glue and a blow dryer so yeah so
I want to personally thank you miss
Sandra for this amazing work that you've
done
I am truly a fan and I'm gonna throw all
my front water told everybody my sister
already up in line so yeah make sure you
guys hit her up I'll put our links below
um as well as her Instagram and I
believe she has a snapchat she doesn't I
won't put that obviously um and yeah let
me know what you guys think and I will
catch you in my next one but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
