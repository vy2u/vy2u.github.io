different space where my bathroom right
now so today is the official kickoff of
a video a day so I'm pretty much gonna
do my makeup
cuz I have somewhere to go and once this
event with my sister for someone I
actually met
I support clothing line and someone I
met at the mosquito party so she's
having her opening tonight I believe for
a new collection so we're gonna go okay
so I'm gonna turn this ring light on
because this is gonna I'm not gonna be
able doing makeup right I usually do it
in this lighting in the bathroom but
this is the primer I don't see if it
works even though I'll just put
foundation on my face you can go ahead
and rub it in when I was at the store
though this was like a really pretty
bottle so that kind of sold me cuz ur
mom your mom lipsticks um but it felt
really good when I put it on so let's
see if it actually works I'll let you
guys know if it works if it'll ever come
to hell out there go easily annoyed by
 and people say oh you know you
should ignore it and that's another
thing that really irritates me and
aggravates me about a lot of people is
they want to tell you how you should
handle the situation as if what they're
saying it means anything to you in the
moment in which you're just irritated
and you're aggravated because even
though you're trying to be the voice of
reason you're really just making the
situation worse
and sometimes I don't want to hear what
the you gotta say sometimes I want
to post what I want to post and do what
the I want to do because it's my
 in my platform to do so you always
have the ones who want to come through
and try to tell you how to act
about that has nothing to do with
them it's like okay and like I said
before and I've said in my other videos
a lot of the people who want to give you
advice need to take their own
advice which I didn't get on here to ask
what the I should do I got on here
to tell you how to off that's the
difference you know and like I've always
said I don't bust out and go out
everybody okay because I don't feel like
it's necessary to go at everybody but
some people will take a joy in getting
 nerds but here's the gotcha
gotcha they are not prepared when you
clap back at the edge and I seen the
video that really modeled it recently
but she was pretty much saying like yo
if I don't like that I see you
doing and you want some other you
trying to start some you want some

then I'm going on the clap back
at your ass cuz I'm not like Papoose I'm
a go off and I don't give
a how you feel and dude everybody
wants to come with the Oh people have
too much time on their hands it's like
that she said it takes two seconds to
block a bitch and go to off in your
comments okay that may be the one thing
you did that entire thing that
pertain to somebody acting and being
stupid towards you there are certain
people that was saying majorly slick
 to me all the time
they still comment on every video they
still comment on every photo but they
still feel like they can say little
stupid little slick to me and it's
gonna ride and then soon as I balance
back and get at them all of a sudden I
need to humble myself and it's like shut
the up you need to humble yourself
and understand who the you talking
to bitch cuz we friends like
that okay so humble yourself is knowing
that we ain't eggs boo mother
Coon like they're for you to be talking
to me and feeling like you can be that
 open I get it but don't do it
because then that's gonna be their
 repercussions and what the
you just did and if you don't
like it then you shouldn't say
it everything that I feel I don't say
everything that I think is a mess I
don't you know st. goar said you should
do this and again what I don't want of
opinions unless a text some people are
way too maybe they stand behind their
computer and it use it is the well I'm
just saying it's like what do you mean
you just I mean you should have said
 bitch cuz I didn't out you
how about that you should have kept me a
little two cents to yourself there
people all the time who acts stupid
um Oh
like for instance I uploaded a video um
upload the video to my Instagram and it
was about well I'll call a video you
and it's pretty much a video that I've
done that I will upload for this month
that I don't think I've uploaded as of
yet and it's pretty much about me unless
I did it must have to leave to do which
I'm try to do but that particular part I
still have and um yeah I was like people
want to give you all this
you're trying to check you on how you
should act in this like bitch you don't
even check your kids homework
bitch how the you checking me on my
 about what the I'm doing bitch
you know over there say that new you be
 who got a life for the last ten
years you go check that but don't don't
check me bitch tonight that one and
sometimes people us as youtubers we
gonna do you don't like or
you don't agree with that doesn't mean
that you have to write a whole
 soliloquy in an essay at
the bottom of my video about how to
you feel about it cuz again nobody asks
you for your opinion I'm telling you
what the I like it what the
I'm doing
now what the you like and what you
do that's your business so a lot of
times when you say stuff like that all
of a sudden you're not humble anymore
because you tell somebody to stay out of
your business and watch
your mouth and respect you that's your
not humble anymore okay are you members
cuz I'm not doing it you got people got
issues with how the way you run
your and the way that you
 act and I never understood
that you have so much time to keep going
back and forth about things about me
that you don't like yeah I'm sure your
bills are not paid I'm sure your
car a note is not paid I'm sure your
loan is still a default I'm sure mother
 and you should have got your
 check engine light off
it's so many other things that you could
be doing right now as opposed to trying
to tell me about myself as if I really
do give a
I really don't the only thing is I don't
care about what you say about me just
make sure you don't say it to me because
then for then I'm gonna have something
to say to you and the thing that is
always there killed me
and they would never say that she told
you I'll never up yet to come and I'm
offering people to come and tell me how
the they feel in person I want you
to oh I want you to but I've never
perience nobody coming to me telling me
exactly how they felt about me
as if they would you online and again
it's just people are talking but at
the end of the day when you put forth
all your effort all your time to do
something great and then you have people
literally they do nothing all day you
know I'm saying they are County
Building recipients who don't have a job
we're not looking for a job who's back
supposedly hurts um trying to
tell you about what the you should
do and have such an opinion about what
you buy and where you going what you
wear and all of this stuff and don't get
me wrong there are people who actually
questions all the time about things that
I do and not always answer I always make
sure that I reply unless it's something
that I've already answered and then it's
up to you to go figure out where I
answered this you know because usually
within a previous department is usually
if it's about hair it's in the condom
for the hair either the clip or the
photo that I posted up answer that
question
some people are lazy and they expect for
you to pick up their laziness and I'm
not doing that
if you didn't see what I wrote before
then I don't know what else to tell you
figure it out because that's how many
folks I really give I'm giving you all
the information and we talked about this
before and I feel like I've done a video
like this before but it never really
goes away it never gets to the point and
people always said you can't handle the
thing and it's like it's not
Fame bitch kids even was famous I still
wouldn't be doing videos on a
regular about regular you know I'm
saying I would be at a fortune 500
company having deals about big so
it's not about fame you guys heard a lot
of times people just don't really give a
 about how other people feel because
in the moment it's funny and it's cute
and it's all of that but then when I
soon as I clap back at your ass
and it's only time I'll run down
and get at you like you didn't think I
was gonna get it you argue the attention
that you wasn't ready for all of a
sudden I'm just the evil is the most
honorable person in the world and it's
like then why are you here just think
about it if there's a bitch that you
just don't necessarily like why are you
there why are you
since why why are you talking to them
why are you having any interest in
anything that they're doing why there's
a reason why I don't follow as
Lu bangs I love this big bee phone but
wait this a lot of times the things that
she's saying the way she Sam um they
come off where I just it's not my cup of
tea it's not really my shoes so I just
don't with her I don't sit on her
page you complain about what she does
because that's her she used she made her
 histogram count she made her
 Twitter account and she did what
the she wanted to do with the
so I'm not about to tell you that you
shouldn't do it or you shouldn't feel
that way she clearly has a reason as to
what her feelings on what they are if I
don't leave her her feelings in the
that she's doing been therefore I should
not follow her I'm not gonna follow my
body Nikki go play and if people
complain like we really give a
bitch you don't do nothing who are you I
just thought I just found out you
existed and there's the last couple of
characters I don't care that's the thing
and then when you say like that
people want to get it out of - again
 attitude I really don't care
like I'm at that point where I just
don't give a like completely I
don't give a anymore
and I'm kind of going back to where I
was still not giving fun um and I kind
of miss it because when I didn't really
give a like that and I really just
look like whatever about I know is
that a lot of we just
leave it alone
but because I'm trying to turn over a
new leaf I don't think me and leaves to
get along um and she was like you need
to stop addressing your haters see when
you tell the person you need to stop
doing something Oh
already you have overstepped your
boundaries bitch other actually
would refer you to tell me what the
I should stop doing
you should stop coming to my
 page Charlie my
mama - so Sheila well I'm just sayin you
know and I listen what people don't
understand is we reply to positivity and
negativity but only thing you're seeing
is the negativity because that's what
you're the most focused on it's not my
father that's what you remember the most
your liberty' god I hope get a refund
you don't remember to grow that I hope
my get our prom dress you don't
remember - I guess the problem here -
you don't remember that you don't know
that
because you're so focused in the fetch
awaited with me popping back at somebody
else so that's the D makes you remember
the most all the giveaways I've done
everything people don't remember this
stuff because they don't want to so it's
not my fault that you're choosing to
pretty much go on the negativity and
keep that in your memory bank
that's not my farm and I really don't
give a if you do feel that way
that's your business
just don't tell me about it cuz I really
truly don't give a and it's really
what the it is you know when all is
said and done if you really got a issue
with me about God knows way who knows
it's hard for me to have the issue of
more I hear you when I don't know her
it's hard for me to have an issue with
Luke him if I don't know her it's the
hard for me to have the issues we can't
be Harry if I don't know where it's hard
for me to have an issue with a database
when I don't know her okay so people
take personal issues or a
you never and probably will never meet
in your life so seriously and if people
start to push you know they want to push
out they chest like they gonna
do something you've never been off your
block but you try to tell me what you're
gonna do when you see me cube I'll be
waiting for their code is just like you
won't be waiting for that million
dollars in John those two I don't know I
don't know it's just like this is what
I'm saying right now is it's not just me
it's everybody feels like this cardi B
is always going off on these rents that
I'm going on right now because she gets
tired and you're only one person and you
can only do it so much for so long until
you just smell and you just get tired of
it and it's not that you can't handle
what's given to you is you get tired of
this it's like when a dumb person in
class
keeps on bringing up stupid and
then you like can we just move on with
the lesson because you just want
to be stuck in a place and you want to
feel like you really doing something or
when the person tries to tell the
teacher that they were on who the
acts you weirdo about anything like you
sit the down
that's how to be feeling about people
sit the down nobody asks you about
nothing but yeah I just
I'm just really at that point where I
just I just don't give a no more
like for real like whatever money
at this point and whoever I got a issue
with how my actions
no no cry on the riverbed bitch
I'm doing foot you know because some
people feel a little too attached to me
like they know you and they can tell you
and reprimand you about what you should
do do you even have kids
and if you do you take care of me
because you ain't too concerned about
another grown-ass person versus your own
children but I wanted to do a video a
day and me again because last year I cut
it short because the whole loving hug
reviews and then acting stupid as hell
for whatever their reason so I wanted to
do it again for the whole month of May
and you guys get to see kind of a
different side of me what I do on my on
my downtime I'm seeing my off days but
every day for me is the day off day and
now yeah I just wanted to do this
because I feel like you guys a lot of
times feel like oh we don't really get
to know you
which is weird because I've been on
internet forever so just kind of you
know not that part of um you know I
wanted to do this before actually
because I know the movement process for
me oh it's got so much it takes
forever but a lot of time you guys
actually like random questions about
different stuff like you I'm gonna get
their house your apartment or and it's
like if I haven't done it yet
there's a reason so stop asking that's
why I feel like some people can be
annoying to that point like to a fault
is that you keep asking me the same
 question
over and over and over again and your
efforts to get a reply are not very
great
just like people got ask me about a
makeup tutorial and I'm like I'll do it
one day when I can you know saying I'm
used to doing my makeup and low-light
like this because I can see all my
highlights and so if you can't see from
here it looks crazy premiere but in his
mirror I can really see I don't like to
be rushed to do things then I'm Sam I
may mention something three months
before I actually do it but that doesn't
mean for three whole months to
be annoying about it and the thing is it
won't be the younger kids that irritate
me immigrants women and it's like for
instance I'm doing a tutorial on how I
make my legs I did another one because
apparently don't want an idea before
people want to complain about
for whatever reason so people were
quested anyone so I'm like okay cool
fine I'll do it but because I've already
done it I'm gonna take my sweet precious
time to do it whenever I just have a
Down moment and I decide to do it but
I'm not gonna be rush to do it every
video it's about three girls who asks
the same question over and over and over
a game and I'm just sitting
there like are you serious like and I'm
gonna say girl women who acts the same
question and it's not like I'm about to
show you anything different than
probably what you've already seen it's
just going to be my technique and my
method of how I personally do it however
I don't need to be a question four or
five times about the same thing oh you
want to go on every video and
ask the same question I'm going to tell
you right now the only thing that's
going to get you is blocked because
you're being annoying
and on top of that people I guess it's
they just think that I don't have
anything else going on like I said at
home like some people in do videos all
day and for some people that's cool but
for me
that ain't my reality y'all I'm sorry to
say but I'm not sorry you know like I
don't have time to sit at home all day
and just record challenges and random
thoughts and stuff like that I'm just
not that type of youtubers and I think
that y'all don't get that you're trying
to mold me in something that I'm not
again when things are fun for me I'll do
them if I have extra time to do it I'll
do them then when I take extra time I
don't have to be doing anything what I'm
trying to do that either
you know nothing doesn't people don't
get OH
I'll be at home um with a friend and
we're will pull something on snapchat or
will pull something who in Instagram oh
you got you do videos and it's like
little water yeah it's like okay so
you think every time we get together is
a camera needs to be out in and we need
to like yeah people will start to think
and look at youtubers like we're a damn
DVR that's not true so it just becomes
it becomes that annoyance that just gets
on my nerves you know like let
me do things when I get ready to
do it stop trying to force these are my
meet ones and these are called
all-natural round which they look alike
oh this I don't know what here I'm
putting on with this job but I just wore
I had a little banana powder on alright
but I'm just wearing some black jeans
this is Giuseppe Bello
this shirt I've worked my hair my total
wave I just found this I found it ain't
seen it since I last whatever was in a
cleaner and I think you know
put it and then I'm aware your knees
Giuseppe's which I'll take off so you
can tell what is cheese which are like a
navy blue and has like the big just let

black from a distance so that's why I'm
just gonna go here don't wear man get

homie up it just every store found them
in Vegas and they ship them to me so but
I love these either come these are about
the most comfortable giuseppe's at our
own it's Becca and what is this new hole
it's pressed harder to topaz it's like
an illuminator should bomb Israel it's
worth every nickel I think it's like $30
but he's so worthy to Too Faced better
than sex and my natural lashes want my
ring although that I just drop hot he
gave me some straight lashes and I
didn't got no false he's armed but this
year were no y
perfume super and look this from
Givenchy which is called very
irresistible this smells so freakin good

what the bottle looks like and it just
smells so good so as you guys can see I
just brought some it's a soft smell so
don't worry I'm not gonna smell like
somebody's Grandmama's couch coming into
the party this is what I do when I'm
wrong places and I'm not taking a bag of
any sort I find ways to like to slip
combs sucking comb my hair to go up
