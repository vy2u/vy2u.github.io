this nice Italian yaki that I'm rocking
right now and this is from Ginny's lace
wigs I think as I said G I in NY place
of Ginny you know Jenny would have G you
know um last week so you guys know that
I've had Italian yaki before I had one
wig previous to this but it was a still
top wig from a different company this is
not a sub table this is just a lace wig
but it's the same length is another one
which is 28 inches um it's really full
but it's not as full as my other one was
which I kind of like um so I'm gonna get
to the specs of this wig and then I'm
gonna tell you of course to do's and the
don'ts and the things that I like and
I've disliked about it so this is the
wig this is a stock photo so those my
papers tour but this is what it looks
like on their site um so I'm gonna give
you the specs it's a 28 inch jet-black
Brazilian full lace wig Italian yaki so
it is I measured it it's definitely 28
inches so it's very long the color is in
the picture so is of course is J black
the capsized circumference is a 21-2
21.5 so it's that's a small cap the lace
color is a light brown and then the hair
density is between 110 and 130 and there
is no so top I would have liked this
with the soaked top because I think it
looks more natural with um these wigs
look a lot more natural with the silk
top you can see like the thickness of
the wig growing out of the scalp where
is with this you can't see it it's just
lace like all this is lace which kind of
sucks because you know close-up this is
not gonna sell you know so the trick but
other than that though it is very very
very occupied it's very full as you can
see it's very full um you can straighten
this hair it's human hair so you can
definitely straighten his hair I will
say this one compared to the one that
I've had before what I will say is
different is the fact that this has that
but that Ridge in it which I don't
really like as you can see like in the
hair
you can see the zig zag I don't really
like that too much because it kind of
gives off the effect that it's not real
like it's a wig because my other one
didn't come like that it was just very
poofy and thick however if you just
simply put some water on this and then
blow-dry it with the blow dryer then
it'll start to come out and start
looking more natural versus having this
uniform zigzag in it um I will I could
tell you based off how it feels if I did
strain his hair it would not be the
fullest it's it's it's like most people
who are african-american their hair is
very full when it's in its natural state
but as soon as you put a hot comb to it
a lot of times it just starts to get
really really really thin so I can tell
you right now cuz if you do whenever you
want to see like how thick some hair is
just take it and do this and however
thick it is in this it's gonna let you
know how thick it is once you're
straightening so this entire section
would be about this thick on this side
and then this side will probably be
about this thick so together it would
give me a very natural blowout but it
won't be extra full like it's looking
right now and I could notice it I don't
know if it's just the light but you can
tell like right here there's a it's like
lighter it's lighter this lighter it's
lighter and I don't know what that is I
don't know I'll have to probably wash
this wig cuz whatever was in or whatever
was on it it'd have this little cheetah
pattern but you can't see it in like
natural light you can't see it but this
ring light is showing that's why I like
it because it shows everything um one of
the things that I dislike about this
week is that it has shed it a little bit
um it hasn't been like crazy wools not
doing it now okay but see like this like
if you run your fingers to it there's a
strut
it is a normal week so sometimes you
have to kind of go through it and get
the the kinks out and then once you
start to wear it a little bit and get
some wear out of and whatever the extra
strands that were left will eventually
just be gone so yeah it like as you can
see I'm taking this nice paddle brush
and it goes through this really easy now
I know when I
did the review on my last one a lot of
people went and brought their wig and
then I met this one particular young
lady at one of my friend's birthday
parties and she's like you know you did
the attire Yankee and I loved it and I
got the wig and I hated it now that was
wrong with it like was it not like mine
she said no it was exactly like yours
but it was just too thick and it was
just hard to do it again this hair is
very natural this hair is not like you
have to understand this is it's
maintenance because it's so thick and
you can't just like okay I'm gonna do
this I'm Ines idem braided it I don't my
other one i braided it I put it up in a
bun I put the ariana grande I did a lot
with that wig so I knew what purposes
that it was serving for me I would never
wear this wig just to be like oh I'm
gonna go out on my errands because it is
so thick and after a while it does get
annoying because it wants to starts it's
kind of like wanna tangle and when thick
hair like this wants to tangle you don't
need a paddle brush because if you don't
you gonna mess around and be very pissed
off that your entire wig is now in a big
knot but if you don't want that what you
could do is you could say I could take
this and I could break this all the way
down right here in the front
we don't just twist it right now cuz I
don't feel like breaking nothing like
this in the front I could put a brave
right here I mean I could do a whole lot
with this to be more versatile so if you
are one of those people who is natural
and you're you you don't want to leave
your natural hair out or you want
something a little more you know
realistic looking to go by one of these
wash it blow-dry it and you should be
alright you can break this down I could
put some french braids into this I could
do a whole lot like you can give the
effects that you can give with this wig
is a lot you know like it's it's it
could come off very very naturally and
give that very realistic look it doesn't
have to always be you know Brazilian
straight you could give like okay this
is my natural hair and I think idea
right here was put some concealer and
then just put my baby hair out right
here and put just a little bit of edge
control because I don't want to put too
much because his hair is not straight so
then it just starts to look like your
edges it's real slick and then it gets
real thick
so I just when I this particular part
right here I just went and took the
president home like I did in my other
one I just took the person home and I
just went in my part to just separate it
so a kid lay flatter cuz if I party like
right here you can see how thick it
would look when you first get it like
it's full so this is how thick it would
be on one side its thick this is my
right here that's trying to be straight
now
um but yeah this is the roots so they're
very very full but again I would have
loved this if it was a still top I
didn't act so it's not their fault it's
just that I really forgot that my other
one was soaked up cause I've had it for
so I've had that wig for like like a
year and a half and the only reason why
I wanted a new one is because now that
wig is something else is being done to
it so I needed just another everyday
Italian yaki wig but yeah again this is
from Ginny's lace wigs and it's 28
inches is jet black is of course Italian
yaki and if you guys are interested make
sure you guys I'm hit the links below
and let me know what you think
if you get this wig tag me on instagram
tag me on Twitter or whatever so I could
see what it looks like on you and I will
catch y'all in the next one
oh and I also want to say because I
always forget to say this sometimes in
my reviews about the combs in the cap
construction it was all it was lace all
the way around so I just cut the lace
off in the front there is some lace
still on in the back and then um there
are combs there are only two combs which
are the two combs that I have right here
there are no combs in the back and there
is no adjustable strap so um if you want
some extra security then you either have
to bond this down or put some more combs
in it so you can feel like your wig is
not gonna go anywhere but this natural
puppy I do like and I will be wearing
cuz you know I like this good old I got
my natural hair hear me roar look but
I'm Brazilian here back into I can
shoulder the next goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
