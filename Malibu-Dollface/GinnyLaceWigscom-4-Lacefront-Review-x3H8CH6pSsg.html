Oh
my bunny okay so now I know y'all think
you look real real real hood right now
and I know cuz the color definitely gave
me an old-school hood vibe I used to
wear my hair this color way back in the
day when I say baby back in the day I'm
in like 2005 um this was like my
favorite color and I seen it and it was
asking me what way do I want and I was
like I kinda wanna do that one what I
did not know though is that it did not
have any black roots to it when I
initially um asked for it so I got this
wig like a week and a half ago and when
I got it I was like oh but I didn't want
to dye it because I'm like some people
might actually like it so I had put it
on like a lot of people put on a wig
swear at me right on the hairline just
to see what it would look like if you
reminded me of the color that I used to
love and wear so often so once I did
that I was coming like okay I like it
but I just look good like I'm getting a
hood baby mama vibe from this color on
me specifically so I was like warm I
didn't wear my earrings and I also asked
me about these earrings they hurt
I usually only wear them for the purpose
of completing the look they were a
dollar - beautifly okay that's what her
um but anyway and then after that I had
like a new lip like my favorite new lip
that I always wear and it just wasn't
working with this look so I just rocked
this blue color from I'm so for the
other day which is echo by Kat Von D and
I was like you know what my girls love
the lipstick so why don't we just go
ahead and throw the jacket on and
complete the look um sorry oh I'm gonna
get to the spectrum stuff on this um
puppy in a minute this is from Ginny
lace wigs which I've never received a
box this beat-up or a box like this
before they usually be like laminated in
a lot of color
I don't know just kind of look like a
box from like oh the food place you know
you guys know the standard there's
nothing new this is what the bag came in
with the way again and then the
information for it was printed on this
piece of paper which is this so this was
the way to look like when I seen it on
their website and I was like oh that's a
pretty color and then I was gonna wear
it like that and then I was gone up or
new originally because I just I don't
know it doesn't have dark roots on the
picture either
I just assumed that it was going to I
was looking at the color not to actually
get so I was going to do a middle part
because I'm like what does it be cute
with some layers timer and Iommi Kimble
hair was just color one time and she had
a pretty middle part with it it was real
birdy around her Tyra Banks uh I'm sorry
I bullied you days so that was not the
case so I'm gonna give you the specs and
then I'm gonna give you a little info
what I did with the wig to try to make
it a little more natural but kind of
keep it hood stop this puppy is 24
inches alone so as you can see the lamp
y'all stole 24 the color is a number
four and this is definitely a true
number four it has the nice luster in it
so I didn't put anything in it this is
what it came like and this is what it's
been like since I've had it I've been
trying recently to put not put a lot of
product in my hair like I usually like
to do or my reviews because I know I
bloggers didn't come with that much
Lester's because I did it they didn't do
it I did this is a clueless cap and it's
a lace front wig again this is not a
full lace or else my part would look
very different right now people it is
only a lace front so it stops about
right here so I just kind of pulled it
over to kind of give it more of a
realistic like there is more parting but
is not it comes with an adjustable strap
in the back and it comes with two combs
on the side so I'm pretty snug up in
here I don't really need much more
like it's not gonna come off I'm not
gonna move it but it ain't gonna come on
is that it's 100% remy hair and it feels
like because it's very silky and very
soft it is no so top and my lace color
is always a lighter brown so what I did
do with the front of this because I just
didn't want that like because this is
very close to my skin tone and I mean
very close so if I want to put this on
my hairline it wouldn't look like I was
running together no matter how much
highlight i did i would look like i was
running together so what i did was i
simply pulled my hair out here in the
front and then kind of put some baby
hair here and try to make it look like
my root MA groups my roots have grew out
like just a little bit since I've had my
hair color now as I was doing my hair
today and it never really registered
with me because usually when I get my
wigs I um I don't have no makeup on or
anything like that when I do it so it
doesn't really give me I don't feel like
anybody or reminds me anybody until I
actually put my makeup in my hair and
you know all this good stuff on but my
hair reminds me stylize and everything
of AJ Johnson who is now I mean she's
like a life coach I seen her own Lindsay
Lohan's um reality show but she this is
what this remind me of every time I see
her she has this same color I seen her
in the mall to like like a month or two
ago I sent her the mother cone she
always wears and for her it's a it's a
contrast between this color and her skin
tone cuz she has like this beautiful um
dark brown skin and you know she has his
lighter number for hair but for me it
just kind of look like I got my hair the
same color as my skin and say I'm
puffing um but the wig itself we're
gonna get off the color for a minute the
wig itself I will say is a very nice one
this is all of the hair pulled forward
so it's not crazy full
not at all but for the color I don't
know if I would really want this hair to
be as full as I normally would if it was
black um but it's a satisfactory fool
it's not crazy full but it's definitely
not crazy thin I just don't think this
would do well with curls you know like
this wouldn't really look cute with
curls because it is not the fullest and
that's the thing if the hair is not full
and you try to curl it it's going to
really show how thin the wig or how many
reps you don't have aside from that I'm
the construction is very good I have got
no shedding so far and I've been wearing
I wore this hair but I had a hat on so I
don't think it counts
well all your hair color is really
pretty but they come only see the East
eNOS that was going on up in here yeah
um but I do like to try that's why I
wanted to try this color I do like to
try different things what I will do
though just because I do like the Widow
a lot I'm going to get a red color like
a more of an orange red color and put it
over this color so it's going to make it
look more like a gingerbread versus the
eesti red and it won't be kind of like
this just number four brown so I got the
cover today so I'm gonna go ahead and do
the color tonight and then I'm see how I
really like it but I do like the wig
don't get me wrong I do like it and it
was definitely easy to blend it here in
the front and me you can kind of see my
lace my right there but it's cool um but
it wasn't hard to blend it at all it
just kind of look like my hair is darker
in the front I could grew out of had
this color for like a good almost a
month you know and it kind of grew out
and I'm still rocking the color but
other than that I do like it I just
wouldn't wear it on a regular basis
because of the fact that it makes me
personally look a little bit more on the
hood side however
if you're lighter than me perfect if
you're darker than me perfect if you are
my color no bueno
um I coulda style this differently and
it probably would have had a different
look but because
I personally feel like no matter what I
do is gonna look better on me period but
hey everybody let me know what y'all
think do you let me know which I think
of this color do y'all like this coming
down I want me to go a little lighter
make it a little bit darker and do you
think that I should make it a ginger red
because this is the tone of a gingers
under color and then it's usually just
red on top of it so it looks more like
the gingerbread you know um so let me
know again this is from Ginny lace wigs
and before I go I'm going to make sure
you guys use cold DM 20 and you can say
$20 on any lace wig so yeah again this
was a lace front it was not a full lace
wig so it does stop right here
and this is what I was saying in my
other videos some lace fronts stop
further forward and others go further
back it just kind of defend it kind of
depends on the manufacturer and the
amount of party space they're allowed to
give you I think this is like two inches
that's not lie you know so that's why I
was very limited on what I could do
because I did honestly want to do a
middle part with this but I can't part
my hair tip back here and it's gonna
look right and I don't think a part this
short is considered a middle part that's
a - that's not a part okay so yeah oh
let me know your thoughts at the bottom
oh and look you know and I will catch
you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
