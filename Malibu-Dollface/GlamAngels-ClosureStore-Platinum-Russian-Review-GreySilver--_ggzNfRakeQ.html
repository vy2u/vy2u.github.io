well
okay so with no further ado we're gonna
talk about this nice golden girls Morgan
Freeman here I have right now um this
hair is okay I love you too and why I
did this color and how I did this cup
well I'll do a separate video about how
I did the color but I'll explain why I
did the color and what cut on what
company is from this is uh from glamour
angels hair and this is their platinum
Russian hair I have in to bundle know I
have four bundles two of which are two
26 s and the other one is 228 and I have
a 16 inch so the best closure okay so I
posted this picture I mean this hair on
Instagram and there were so many people
who loved it and then there were so many
people who hated it which usually is
when you you know something is new and
it's different and it's you know it's
just kind of a little bit out of the box
versus what everybody else has been
doing I've seen a few people go gray but
not really great to my liking cuz
usually it was like something either I
didn't like or the way it was installed
I didn't like or the way that they did
it I didn't like so yeah but this color
that I have right now is gray it is true
grey um I seen a picture of Adam Lambert
a while ago please stop doing that a
while ago
I'll hold this because these curls are
nice and young fresh and new um Adam
Lambert at some award show or a fashion
show not too long ago the picture was
quite old but um his hair was so doe
here like these spikes or whatever I'll
put the picture somewhere here um and I
was just lying how like I want that but
I don't want to bleach my hair and did
have to go gray and I didn't even know
how to get gray or whatever and was
crazy is that the the products that I
used to get this color where things that
I've used them beauty school on older
people um the thing is I had talked
to the people over there and glam angels
and they were we were gearing up for a
new review and I cuz I loved my last one
and it was like you know who do you want
to try next and I was like I think I
want to go Greg and I need some flight
Amer to do so and you guys know my girl
ivy here on YouTube she just went gray
and she had told me the components that
she used to get gray or whatever hers is
a bit different than mine because her
ombre comes further down than mine Stu I
wanted mine is very concentrated at the
root so I was happy that when I got
myself base closure that it was only my
closure starts right here so um it was
only this much that was dark and then
the rest was blonde and when I say
blonde I mean platinum like Jessica
Simpson Britney Spears blonde like Heidi
Klum blonde um in this hair it looks a
bit on the blonde side like you can um
see some of the blonde still in it and
it looks a bit on the lavender purplish
side as well and that's because I used
shimmering lights which is for older
people with gray hair so that you guys
know when people get older and their
hair start to turn gray and they wear
gray you have to use special shampoos
and conditioners on their hair um so
that their hair won't stain when you use
things like um shampoo conditioner
regular shampoo and conditioner it was
sometimes trip the hair out and make the
hair yellow so in order to keep the
color and keeping this like this gray
you use stuff like shimmer light so
that's why it's a it's like a hint of
lavender in it because I used um I
forgot
I'll do a video separate from this about
exactly what I use and show you the
actual bottles and the products but for
right now I'm just coming sing over from
what I remember but I did have ivy and I
text her and I was like would cuz I know
she was doing a video about it and I was
like what are you going to I mean like
what did you use to get great so she
told me um I had brought the color to do
the to put over to platinum to make it
gray and then you put some more stuff on
it to have it sit for X amount of hours
in order to keep it growing
um I the lady at Sally's church she gave
me the wrong volume up volume
she gave me 20 and I was supposed to get
10 because you know anything after 10 it
is not deposited anymore it um it lives
so it lifted my blonde hair and made it
no different I just really said up there
and waited all that time really for no
reason because it didn't really do
anything so I ended up using it it's
like a temporary hair rinse it's called
shoot as in true steal but I gotta
remember what the names gonna be right
here I'll put it right down here
somewhere but anyway I put that on a
hair IV I told me to put it on the hair
for about five to six hours I left it on
for 28 hours so when I rinsed the hair
nothing came out I mean of course I had
extra access but um the excess that was
on the hair came out and it stayed
discolored so sometimes when you don't
keep it on there long enough what ends
up happening is the hair ends up being
uh it'll it'll kind of fade so the the
look that I have with this particular
hair it's more of a more of a it looked
like it was probably lavender and then
faded into gray which I love but this
hair after everything that I put it
through it's still very soft and it's
not dry at all like as you can see it's
still very soft it's not dry I could run
my fingers through with no problems
there's no snags no bumps no shedding I
did get um a healthy amount of shedding
I will say after everything that I did
do to it initially as I was putting
things in and stuff like that but after
that everything was pretty good but I
love the color because there's our
Barbie that out she's like I think she's
like a mermaid Barbie her hair is
actually this color which you know yeah
I love anything Barbie do and it's great
to be able to do these type of colors
like this is I think this is going to be
like my new signature color there are
people who do not like this color on me
somebody said that this is not for me
and I shouldn't do this and here's the
thing you guys I see things on your
pages all the time that y'all shouldn't
do but you know I don't say anything
because it's not it's not my business to
tell you that your closure is installed
horribly or stuff like that so just if
we could keep the
personal opinions about what you don't
like just do yourself if you don't like
it just simply don't come in don't watch
if you knew it was gonna be this color
then why'd you click you know it's just
it's that type of situation but I mean
everybody's entitled to their own
opinion which is great and it's fine but
I just don't like the little extra and
Okita okay really different videos so
yeah anyway so I love this I will have
to say this is my favorite color that
I've done period that I've worn period
from the Reds the blue to the blacks to
the blue blacks everything I love this
color so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to do a series I have two more two
more weeks in this color coming um very
files but it's going to be this color so
I'll do an update video on um in this
hair after I shampoo it to see if it
fades but yeah I love it it's it's
everything I love this if you don't like
Greg we're gonna be great um if you
don't like gray
fine whatever and then somebody made the
dumb is coming I've ever heard won't you
just wait till you get older to have
great here you idiot I so yeah anyway
this hair is from glam angels hair and
I'm not gonna write in this review this
hair is from glamour angels hair and if
you like this and you want to achieve
this look go over to Ivy's paint she
gives a detailed video about everything
that she used
we pretty much you to think well we use
the exact same thing um and I will hit
you guys later
and then I'll come back with a video on
what I do processing which I took again
I have four bundles and a 16 inch
closure I have to 28 and to 220 60s
light layers in the front and then I
have a 16 inch closure assume base
closure that has dark roots and the rest
was blonde and I used armed true steel
on the entire hair and I left it in for
like 28
I'm a little mini so yeah I'll talk to
y'all later
and I mean I would you like if you don't
like it make sure your your Commons
respectful like know everything filling
it up like storm you know saying I know
