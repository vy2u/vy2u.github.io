Oh
Oh
all right I know it's been like it's
been ages since I wore this hair y'all
like it really has but this is my glam
Angel's hair that I had did gray plenty
of many of moons ago I do not remember
when I did this hair I'm sure I'll put
how long it's been since I've had this
hair up above um but yeah I wanted to
give you guys like a quick update cuz a
lot of people have been inquiring and
asking about this hair since this
particular hair me the pictures made its
rounds on Instagram so yeah um but this
is my glam angels here I don't remember
what lens I have but I'm almost certain
that this is like 24 inch I think if I'm
not mistaken but everything from the
original video the original video will
be posted below as well as the specs on
this particular hair but I had to find
his hair because I had wore out and then
um I stopped wearing it and then not too
long ago gray just became like the who
did hottest new thing again and
everybody named AMA Wright was our
rockiness and I had made a comment on my
Instagram about it and I was just like
okay cuz okay so Toya you know a little
Wayne baby mama she had this hair the
color I mean she posted a picture on her
Instagram and then the pro pattern and
the way she the cut the CRO everything
was just like how mine's was I was like
hey Tori I added her just to be funny I
was just like hey Tori you know you
could have said hey you know you got a
spoke if you was over here oh and it was
just to be funny because a lot of times
what people don't understand is it like
when they say like Beyonce copies a lot
of people in knowledge sometimes it
doesn't necessarily be her it be the
stylist and then the artist things oh
it's something new nobody's done they
probably never heard of me but their
stylist is on Instagram just to lurkin I
never said that I was the first person
to ever do gray hair or anything like
that but it just looked very similar
that's all but anyway um it's been a
while and I put this hair through the
trenches
I had lifted it I had read I did they
send me a new silk base closure for the
from glam angels originally just had
dark roots and then it had it was like
white like white blonde and then all of
it matched his hair however the closure
that they resent me when I read I did
which is this one I used a different
color because I was having an issue with
trying to find the color that I had
before so it's like it was an edit match
so if I were to put this in it would
have been like a very darker tone at the
top and then it wouldn't know so um yeah
but I do want to use this one again I'm
gonna use the same color I'm gonna see
if I can get some more bundles but I
think I want like like 34 inches of this
color because this hair seems so short
to me compared to what I've been rocking
lately this seems like a bob because
it's like I'm used to hair all the way
down to my waist and it's just it feels
so short and I was I thought it was long
when I haven't put it in originally
Vietnam clearly not but yeah this hair
has held up the chest and I had to find
a child like it was it was in another
companies box and I was looking I mean
I've been looking for this hair since
partly my I was gonna wear this hair to
Disneyland on my birthday and that's
when I really started like hardcore
looking for it and I could not find it
to save my life but I was going through
yesterday trying to find some other hair
and ran into this I was like yo I've
been looking for this all over cuz you
guys know I've done you know wigs but I
want some more bundles I do want to put
like another like if I could put like
another bundle at the bottom like in the
back just one maybe two um to make it
longer and fuller so it could just be
how my other hair was um I was gonna do
a middle part with this but I didn't do
it because I had already cut this hair
see that's another thing it was cut a
certain way so I can't really change the
curl pattern and how I have to kind of
work in the parameters of how it was
doing originally which I didn't really
like I liked it at the time but now I've
changed how I cut and CRO my hair since
then I think it's been like a year or
some change so you know things change
I'm but this is still holding up my silk
base is still looking silky fine
I feel like storm and then my contacts
are really helping out the situation too
because now I'm giving you like x-men's
teas you know it's like that type of
situation so can't I love this though I
think gray is because I have an issue
you guys know now I found out that six
thirteen blonde is like it works on my
skintone but for the longest time I had
a really hard issue and problem trying
to figure out which blonde works best
for me but now I see six thirteen is my
 however gray is my other option if
I want a lighter color but I don't want
it to be blonde this just complements my
skintone oh so well darling yeah again I
don't know if you guys watched my blog
video yesterday but I hosted it and it's
about these contacts that I have which
are which are my do contacts and these
are in forest green
so yeah I'll be doing a review on these
are um I really like them though yeah
you guys have any questions let me know
I do want to do this hair again though
I'm gonna talk to Glen angels and see
what they talk about over there and see
if they can give me the same you guys
know what my 34 inch air is now 30
inches because okay however my heart
just broke to have to cut it but it
looks beautiful and I want to do that
same style with the middle part with
this but I can't now use the same
closure again use this one and use the
same colors because I really like this
darker version of the grey it's not
insane it has more of this
it looks more of like this box like it's
more on the lines of this box more so
than this this is more like a bright
gray and I'll keep this one for another
option but I think I want to do this but
just really long so y'all let me know
what y'all think and I will keep y'all
posted on what happens and yes girls and
boys good old 50 shades of grey is still
poppin so I'll catch y'all in my next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
