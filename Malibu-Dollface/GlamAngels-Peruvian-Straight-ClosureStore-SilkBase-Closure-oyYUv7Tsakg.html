this hair that I'm wearing which I am in
love with now I'm gonna say that this is
more on the affordable side well
depending on who's asking cuz I get tons
of messages from you guys asking oh my
god can you please do a video on some
more affordable hair the hair you did
for this company is to hide this hair is
too high this is just adding a little
bit okay cool whatever
I got you I believe I found out the
solution to what you need now let me
just make a disclaimer before I even go
into the review what you guys have to
understand for those of you who do not
buy virgin hair who've never wore
version here who never understood why
the pricing is so high for virgin hair
this hair is imported from different
places the quality of this hair will
last you a lifetime if you keep it up
it's not pack hair it's not hair that
you're gonna wear one or twice once or
twice anything you're going to throw it
away this is hair that is gonna have
longevity to it so that comes with the
price now some people will say can you
make a video on some cheaper hair and
let me just say this there is no such
thing as good cheap hair if somebody is
telling you $75 bundles at 28 inches a
bundle then something either that your
homegirl or hung Boyan and hooking you
up or the hair is going to eventually
start shedding you try to color it it's
going to turn orange is gonna be
something wrong with it
okay so I like the word affordable okay
inexpensive let's try those words cuz
those because when you say cheap cheap
means poorly made poor quality and
that's I don't think that's what you
want in your in your virgin hair I don't
um so this particular hair is from glam
angels and the closure that I'm wearing
is from the closure store these are two
separate companies
I think they work in tandem when it
comes down to certain things because
after conversation I was sent
I was actually kind of closure I would
like but I like later still based and I
of course I you know saying um so yeah
so when I got the closure I will say
this it is when I've had many of
closures from different companies and
the issue that I always have with them
and even when I get silk based wigs
sometimes the issue that I have is
because all the hair is put in in one
direction let's just say all the
direction is going back when I try to
part it for a side part it's gonna want
to go do this and it makes this big hump
that you have to find a way in God's
green earth to get rid of and it becomes
an issue this closure was so flexible
and when I parted it was like butter it
party right where I wanted and they just
fell and I kid you not
I'm missing with no other closures but
the corner stores closures for now on
like serious like my hand to God because
they are so freakin good and you guys
know I love a closure I love a good
closure and I love a silk base closure
but sometimes a to gray sometimes they
don't fit sometimes they're too thick it
was the right density I didn't do
nothing to disclosure but put it on my
damn head that was it
sorry for custom but I'm just saying
y'all y'all know what I mean like it
looks so natural it looks so good or
whatever the only thing that's out is my
edges that's it all this is a closure
all this like I just love it and then to
blend perfectly with the hair and one
thing that I will say about this
particular hair is that it took a curl
very well not nine times out of ten when
you first get here because this hair is
more on the straight sideways straight
hair um when you get this hair I make
sure it's straight yeah it's proven
straight so um when you get straight
hair when you try to put a curl in it
sometimes put in a curl in it ends up
being a bit of a hassle because
sometimes it doesn't
oh now I was at Iowa the pictures that I
put on Instagram it's when I freshly did
it did these particular curls that are
in his hair are from a night of flexi
rods okay and I ain't do nothing else
but take the plug flexi rods out the
hair or whatever if you guys want a
styling video on this particular style I
will do one because people have been
asking for that and this is just pretty
much a more toned down version I don't
know if you guys come with months and
months probably some time left early
last year I did a video where I had Lana
Del Rey here and it was like real tall
right here and then it came down pretty
much this with it this is what it was
because I did wear a closure with that
um so people have been asking and asking
this is more of a wearable version of
that hair so you won't walk around the
Glen Jessica Rabbit
you know why you at work so this is more
so that so I'll do I'll definitely do a
tutorial for that because it's very
simple it's very easy it's very breezy
but yeah this hair holds a pearl and you
know unfortunately sometimes when you do
get straight here is mince it just be
straight it doesn't want to stay in a
curl for very long it'll curl great for
the first ten minutes and as soon as you
walk outside and either the heat or the
comity hit it everything drops and
normally when hair drops good hair drops
it drops pretty but sometimes not so
much it a drop where it's these very
loose chunky waves that's not what you
want
so yeah this held or whatever the my
longest length is 28 inches it's not
super thick but it's thick enough like
I'm satisfied you know you know I'm
eighty two bundles but I'm actually
satisfied with the amount of hair that
is on this arm on this cap now when I
received it here it did come with some
glam angels hair care tips and I'll let
you guys if you guys do order read over
these because there's a lot of
information but it's very great
information in this information that you
should read because it is going to help
the longevity of your hair at last now
um
they they tell you everything that you
shouldn't you should not do how to brush
how to comb conditioners that they would
suggest
conditioners they would not suggest and
styling products that will help the hair
look better as you style it so that's
good because some companies don't do
that they just give you the hair and
then they say you figured out watch a
YouTube video figure it out you know
it's my responsibility at that
particular point to tell you how to take
care of your hair and it's not I don't
get paid for that so that's not gonna
happen
so yeah I like this hair I will say this
is affordable all their bundles start at
$75 and up so that's really good because
most bundles started like 120 or 150
depending on what company how popular
the company is sometimes they check up
the prices but this is proven straight
and again I have in 28 24 22 and 26 not
in that order and I have a 16 inch
closure from the closure store now again
I believe that they work the companies
work in tandem but I think that you may
as a person have to order separately
like I want his hair that he has which
is the Peruvian but I'm gonna go to the
closure story on order my closure but
besides that hair is banging oh and this
is inexpensive hair this is not the top
of the line here but it looks like it
and that's what I'm saying you don't
have to spend a fortune on hair just
make sure that you take care of it and
this hair is definitely one of those so
Glen angels good luck and for all those
who are looking for a more inexpensive
way of buying extensions I think this is
definitely the route that you should go
because you can still get beautiful
curly hair and beautiful straight hair a
beautiful way to hear for not a fraction
of the price you would give for other
companies and you know give or take your
preference or whatever but disclosure
whoa yes baby disclosure is everything
you're like mmhmm yes I'm loving this I
love every inch of it hmm all 16 of it
okay are you going in but yeah I didn't
do nothing but curly I put a little
light layering in the front of it so
that you know it wasn't just like boom
but other than that here's everything
every ounce of it so yeah if you have
any questions make sure that you hit me
up in the website is glam angels hair Oh
calm and then the other site for the
closure is closure store calm so I hope
you guys enjoyed this and make sure you
guys check out my pictures on my
Instagram which is at Malibu doll face
and follow at closure store and at
glamour angels hair on Instagram
I know but talk to y'all but he was
