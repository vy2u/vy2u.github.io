so I come to review this hair that has
stirred up a whole bunch of drama just
now on Instagram because every Apple is
in the video that I probably will put it
from be probably seen in beginning of
this and I said who's bald-headed and um
everybody speculated and vicious is no
it's not yes it is you remember it is
he's the winner braids no he didn't this
is this is it I just don't understand
why people are so intrigued by when
other people's hair looks like a certain
way or you know who's bald-headed and
who isn't my questions it matter um but
I'm not buying it obviously but I just
thought it was very funny because people
really take it to heart and they get so
passionate about and I'm gonna use the
word passion because really it's just it
would bitch be mad so yeah anyway um
this wig is actually from one of my
favorite wig companies and the very
first wig company that ever sent me
anything to review which was um April's
lace wigs um they were responsible for
my now famous from one-in-a-million wig
that I love that I wore on Halloween
that I've been wearing and I still wear
to this day that's still kicking um so
yeah they were the company that actually
got me into wearing wigs because before
that I was very scared and I was like oh
my god it's going to look like a wig so
yeah this is the actual wig is so top
unit um
it's 24 inches agree originally we were
supposed to we were discussing a
different hair texture um I forgot which
one it was I really didn't I'm here now
because I'm so in love with this but
they was like we don't have that in
stock we continued the entire yaki
though and I'm just like okay
I've never had a teriyaki however my
girl IKEA star I remember she reviewed
it Italian yaki wig before and I was
like it does look very natural so of
course I got it
love it my hair is out I actually did a
tutorial on how to lay this which is
really short due to the simple fact that
um it's not really much it's just you
want to get your pardon
right in there you go so yeah um yeah
it's very long it's 24 inches so you can
see so yeah it looks like real
x2 african-american hair which is very
hard to mimic a lot of times due to the
simple fact that um when people do it is
too coarse so this kind of reminds you
of braiding hair you know like the
Kanekalon it reminds you of that um I
took the wig off it was really flawless
high and solid which you'll see in the
video but I took it off and messed up my
part so it is what it is but as far as
the wig goes I've been wearing this on
and off um for like a week I want to say
like one an officer all week just just
like this um not out cuz obviously in my
tour you see I can delay some so not out
but just in the house just kind of going
around and seeing um you know how it
feels if it's gonna snag if it's getting
sweaty back here um I wash my car in it
so I kind of throw it up and like a nice
little bun or whatever like this I throw
it up okay no like good but you know I
threw it up in a bun or whatever and
then I put a clip on it and then I was
just you know about missions so you
really couldn't tell so it does look
like it could definitely be my hair like
if I do this then yeah it looks like
okay he just really not be hated yeah so
that's pretty much it uh it's not really
much more to say um there are combs in
it it's it's a silk top unit so the
still top is four by four here at the
top but you know I loved weird crooked
so and of course I got a side part cuz I
just love a good type or I feel like
side parts work well with wigs it's
really hard to make a middle part work
with the wig because it just looks real
good so that's why I always do sideways
but I'll start to do the middle part
okay I do middle parts of my new parts
okay
so yeah um there are four combs in the
inside so you can guarantee it's not
gonna go nowhere it's real snug it ain't
going nowhere so that's the good thing
you don't have to slow it down or
anything like that
the lace is very soft so a lot of times
when I do get wigs the issue that I
start to have at
while after about a week is the simple
fact that the lustre of the hair goes
away and then it's just like I have to
start putting Sheen and shine and I'll
listen to it but soon this hair is not
going to be straight you can straighten
this because what I did was I took a hot
comb to kind of open up the part in a
little bit because it's so full and it's
so thick I didn't want it to just be
like no hard like I had a quick leave or
whatever and then I just pulled out my
edges here in the front so I just blow
dry my hair
well actually I let it air dry and then
I just pulled out my edges here in the
front to give it more you know a
realistic look but for the summertime
let's just say you want to go out and
have like a a natural day but you don't
want to have your natural hair so you
know you could do this and nobody would
know so cute little bun or something
that would be really cute just remember
to leave out your edges because when you
don't leave them out it does this and it
starts to look like a wig but you know
you're gonna leave a little something
out on the side nobody could tell make
it don't try to wear it like it's
straight hair wear it like I said you
know and after you put it in a loose
braid or something put it in a you know
a banana clip or something you know
where you just can't tell like oh here
she got a lot of hair you know but I
love this like this is gonna be my go to
it I'm gonna try to break this wig I'm
gonna try it I'm see with I'll come back
I'll enjoy now um but I'm gonna try to
see what I can do with this because I
love the texture cuz it so versatile and
you can actually because it is human
hair so I can actually take this hair
and press it and Flatiron it like it was
my real hair and it probably would look
like my natural hair now my natural hair
does look like this and I'll put a
picture somewhere in here of what it
looks like when it's actually all blow
blow drying and all that good stuff
when it was a bit longer my hair for
people who keep asking me all of these
damn questions about what I used to have
the braids yes that was on my hair and
the thing about it is when I decided to
go into leaves and stuff like that if
you have this much hair in real life and
you're trying to braid it up you end up
with three beehives you end up with a
lot of pain and you end up having to
take a lot of hair out when it's all
said and done I needed to cut my hair
because my hair was damaged at the end
so I cut it my real hair now is probably
like right here or whatever but from
where it was it was down here so I just
choose to keep it that length because I
never wear it out anymore unless I'm
like in between leaves or whatever but I
become such a leaver harlech at this
particular point as long as I'm not
bald-headed I really don't care I just
take care of my hair underneath and then
I wear wigs and leaves and all of that
good stuff so if one day I just say you
know what I'm over it I don't want to
have to worry about my leave out I worry
about this all my hair look like this
again I can do it and I haven't damaged
it to the point where there's no coming
back from it so that's one of the
reasons why we're wigs and this is going
in my go-to pile because I love this um
if you guys have any questions about the
wig or where to get it or all of that
good stuff um make sure that you just
hit me up hello I don't have the little
tab with the specs on it so I'll put all
the specs on the wig down below and yeah
I will talk to you guys later remember
this week it's from one of my favorite
company April's length wigs and I'll put
the link to this wig below if you are
interested</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
