video how long is going to be but I'm
gonna just do it anyways um I'm about to
as you can see here I got my bags packed
I'm not to take a little vacation just
probably a couple of days maybe a week I
don't know I just need like a break like
not from you guys that's obviously does
I'm gonna video um but just kind of
other stuff that's going on in my life
right now that's just not the healthiest
for me right now and it's not she's not
putting me in a good mood and I'm saying
like this is negative and I don't want
to be around it then that's negative um
so yeah it doesn't mean gonna take a
little bit of a break um only told that
I can have a little sanity of my own I
need that you know so it's just like I
know you guys think Phil me on this you
know you just end up in a situation
where everything just seems to go wrong
and just negative and you just don't
understand and you want to believe
someone but you can't because I've lied
to you you know it is those situations
like I give advice about life often but
I go do stuff too so I think that's kind
of what you some people don't get it
like I don't always have the answers
from our own problems I probably got a
better answer for other people's
problems in my own but right now I'm
going to take a nice much-needed little
vacay not going to say I'm going my
flight leaves in like two hours so I'm
running some errands or whatever and
then my friend is gonna drive my car
back from the airport um until come back
so mmm this is like it's just life stuff
you know that you can't always control
and I think my thing is always one like
I told you guys I want things my way
when it out of my way I feel since I've
away but also when people are doing
things to you that you didn't deserve
are there putting you in situations that
you don't want to be in anymore or
they're just a whole plethora of
that you just don't want to do it it's
one of those situations so you know this
kind of is what it is but i'll get over
i'm not i'm not gonna die I'm gonna live
you know it's not like I'm
that bad it's not something that's gonna
make me or break me it just has me a
little frazzled you know I'll get a
little problem now and then but kind of
his way to do my hair is and fail it
don't matter cuz on a plane i'm going to
sleep cuz i need to get a good night's
sleep i have an asset in the 10 but yeah
I don't know if imma be on Instagram
really because it's must be like a
vacation so I need to really put all the
electronics down and vacay and stop
document in my entire life sorry helping
um yeah so that's about it um I don't
know really what I say at this point you
know you feel so zoned out you have
those those moments where you just feel
kinda zoned out and you don't know what
to do it's one of those days but it's
nothing that I can't handle I just feel
so you're feel like it's a black cloud
over your life that's hot but right now
like the cloud is so black and I don't
know what is this cloud keeps coming in
and out and I don't like that so how
about the relationship issues and
problems just like y'all you know it
just it's different for me because I'm
not used to dealing with the
but it is what it is and I'm gonna get
through it and it's good to have people
around you that can help you do things
but it's even better when you have
somebody around you who's always got
your back and we thought that was other
people and they changed you know I'm
saying like you know you get you give us
some idea Nate they claim to always have
your back and then those things change
you know whether you guys are together
or not it's like well we've been through
we build a friendship and it's night I
like it was before because there's new
people you know I'm saying but people
always go for whatever is new is shiny
and pretty versus what's loyal you know
but it's cool I mean that's a testament
for people and you gotta at some point
realize you can't put your everything
into somebody or you can't trust what
someone always says because they can
always lie to you whether you're
truthful and lawyer or not it's not
going to change
what they do so basically what I'm
saying in so many words is do not pass
up something good and that's good for
something that's not so good or not so
great are just bad for you don't ever do
that because of time or loyalty or
whatever the situation is if something
is if it's not causing you nothing but
to be happy than it needs to go that's
just that's the bottom line and go
doesn't mean like forever out of your
life sometimes you just need to go for
the moment you know so let's just kind
of wait where I am and what it is for me
I like every time I see you got on a
white shirt bitch I know I got sure I
told you guys I got like I gotta
probably about 100 of these forever 21
loves me because I kills these bitches
every summer I gotta get some more
though but um that's pretty much it I'm
cool I'm chilling I'm happy you know for
the most part i'm not i'm not down in
the dumps about anything it just that
when things that mean something to you
go awry and and go kind of less you
can't be happy about that you just kind
of like you know but i think this
vacation right now is definitely needed
um so I'm like to just kind of shut
myself out of life regular life for a
second just to have a moment to get to
know people and be happy and go about my
life and do the things that I should
have been doing it's about to be the
summer you know I'm saying like why not
be single and happy ok so that's what
I'm about to do and I hope you guys have
a great day um I can't upload videos
while I'm gone but the interwar did a
video and broken i did a video so I'm
gonna try and get that to you guys I'm
saying she can upload it for me while
I'm gone hopefully I promise and I need
you to do it for me um but yeah I hope
you guys have a beautiful day I'm ok I'm
not gone I know we go through this
everything I'm not going i'm just kind
of dealing with life's troubles at this
moment but i hope you guys are good and
I will talk to you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
