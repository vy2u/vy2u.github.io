crazy baby I can be up up I can be down
within your city smaller than a town I
can be a ghetto bitch yup
you love me I can be spouting dinners in
the oven my flashing my chameleon I can
turn one into a billion me can be all
things to you okay guys so thank you to
everybody who gave me well wishes I'm
feeling much better thank you
so this video is gonna be about this
hell that I'm rocking is curly man I'm
from grace hair and I'm gonna move back
in a second but this reason why I'm
standing this close
um so this is their Brazilian deep wave
or it is a deep wave I don't think it's
a deep curling and I have in to 22 to
20s and an 18-inch closure now I move
back yeah so with most of the curling
hair that I receive a lot of times my
curly hair has this problem with the
closure it is super straight at the root
so I know a lot of people quite a lot of
people with curly hair and most of them
will tell me no my hair doesn't really
look that straight at the root um I did
this and I could have one curled it and
it probably would have fixed the problem
but usually when you buy hair and you
buy closures and you buy frontals you
really want to know what you're getting
beforehand so this is what I'm getting
which you'll be getting beforehand okay
now let's just get to the hair and then
I'll get to the closure in a second even
why I have a closure
I would hey all right so this hair is
their Brazilian curly well they're
Brazilian deep wave not probably deep
wave and they send me four bundles which
I always usually request because I do
like my curly hair to be a little more
fuller um surprisingly not I haven't had
any major shedding issues with
here and usually a lot of my Aliexpress
curly here I tell you guys I have a lot
of shedding problems um but I did follow
these tracks for this cap I did not I
did not cut them if you want to know how
I made my wigs there will be a link to
the video below that video should cover
every question that you ever had about
how I make my wigs okay hope that helps
umm Leah I haven't had any major shading
issues when I first put it in and I co
washed it I dried it upside down and
then I use my blow dryer I have a
diffuser I told y'all about that got a
diffuser um I went ahead and used it and
it was cool when I made the wig I was
like why are these roots so straight so
what I was gonna do was there was a
picture I seen of Cassie on Instagram
and she had some long hair and it was I
was gonna bleach the bottoms of this but
I just decided to opt against it only
because it was doing such a good job of
not shedding didn't wanna cause none at
least not before not before I did the
review so you guys could see what it
looks like cuz if I did have major
shedding issues it would have been
really mines and not the companies when
people hear shedding they get nervous
so we'll see um but what she did was she
had just two braids so we're gonna part
this off really quick it's and I think
our hair might have been twenty four in
the back or her hair just dropped I
don't know so she had two braids one
right here and one right here
and her hair party it pretty much looks
similar to this but it was just two
french braids right here but because I
do have a closure and not a front oh um
I just never really liked the way that
it looked if I had a frontal honestly
and my hair was just straight in the
front it would look better and the
reason why would look better because
everything in the front would even
though this is quite a lot of
straightness everything in the front
would be the same but because it is a
closure my hair is only wavy right here
and then the rest of this because all of
these are tracks all of these are tracks
everything it just is no way to blend
this to make this look believable people
that's it so this is
kind of the syndrome where girls think
if a crimp they here in the front or if
they do a braid out at the top then it's
going to look like the bottom and it
just does it so the hair itself
I'll give it like a nice like b-plus
okay
b-plus a solid b-plus because it did not
shed the only thing that I don't like
about this particular curly hair is that
the luster is very low indeed like it's
not it's not very big and shiny um like
I would like it has a very more of a $1
look to it and I you know put the
regular things that I put my um Co cream
my my serum everything that I use for my
curly hair I used in his hair but
unfortunately once it dry it dry like
this when I received it it was still
about the same luster so I don't really
think much has changed um so the hair be
plus the closure a d-minus okay it was
it was well constructed but grace hair
I'm nijo to get some closures or a
frontal to match this texture the thing
that I never understand about our hair
companies is that if you have things
like frontals being so just wanting
across the board especially on curly
hair frontals look amazing on curly hair
and it's really difficult cuz when you
wet this like when I when it was
actually wet because I didn't I didn't
put I had planned on putting some layers
right here just to you know go ahead and
shape it up but I'm so used to not
having to do that because I'm used to
frontals so yeah I'm not a big fan
overall we don't give it a solid see
okay cuz my hair on the flow and they
are down my butt crack so that's a good
thing but I'm just not I'm not a fan I'm
just not a fan you know um
this hair could be used for something
else but this is what I did hold on boom
fix that so yeah this is probably the
way that I'll be wearing this hair
Owen is with this very cute mosquito
head I have to swimsuit to go with it
but it ain't here yet but ya know it
looks great you know this is a nice
thumbnail you know moment but yeah I'm
just not I'm not a big fan of it without
a head because I like for my curly hair
to look seamless like right now the hair
is giving me t in Tamara realness you
know I'm standing looks like some
genuinely nice curly hair it's not too
uniform but it's not too frizzy it's not
too big when I did wash it I did get um
a nice amount of shedding just from the
initial wash after cuz I like to when I
make my wigs I like to make them then
wash them I find that it's a little bit
easier than washing each Bundle
separately unless I'm doing color or
something then I will do them
individually because I don't wanna end
up with a whole bunch of color in the
back of my hair and I got somewhere to
be
yeah look how nice now this looks great
you know this is pretty and this is
after a co-wash I'm gonna bleach this
hair though I'm just gonna be there is
ok so there's there's something that I'm
doing and I want to kind of do it to
this hair so i'ma get y'all sneak peek
but I'm gonna be willing to do okay so
my new hair can look like this your
thumb would do okay okay so I kind of
want to do something like that to this
uh if you can um tell me who you think
my inspiration was for that and it was
not Nicki Minaj okay or blood Shauna um
but it's a singer would put your job
oh that was my expression for that and
pretty much will be this so I know I say
I'm gonna come back I'm gonna do
something like update two weeks like two
weeks of just updates on my most
requested wigs and then we can start
talking about that wig still I've been
talking about for like two years
but um yeah I think I'm doing like an
update on some of my favorite stuff so
you guys let me know but I'll do update
on this um particular one and I'm asked
them can I just send me a frontal or
custom fonts or something so I can wear
this without a hat but again if you guys
are interested this is our greatest hair
this is a great hair
this is there a Brazilian deep wave yeah
because I want to take you curly
so bad because I some other here that's
like this but it's deeper so this is
their Brazilian deep wave and it is 222
a 20 and 18 inch closure so if you guys
are interested check the links below and
I will catch all and my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
