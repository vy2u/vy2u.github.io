reasons that I don't want to talk about
but whatever this hair that I'm wearing
is Brazilian body what actually
Brazilian virgin by the way if you are
what I said from HJ beauty on Aliexpress
now I've had this hair for like six
months legit so my hair is an 18 it's a
20 and it's a 22 so I have in three
bundles and my frontal is a 13 by 4 lace
frontal that I come on I think it's cute
I think it's very versatile it didn't
require like a lot of a lot of plucking
I bleached it once now mind you I've
hidden curled all my hair upwards and
then let it drop and then brushed it I
was honest and up so you can see like
how long it hits me and then like the
texture of it as well so this is how
long it actually hits me for 22 which
seems like it's extremely long but it's
not it's just the fact that I'm putting
on layers in it that's pretty much what
is the only thing I layered was this top
piece right here so that it could just
do all of this low brightness and then I
just left all of these big waves in it
to just let them bounce around and I pin
this side back just a little bit just
because I want it a little bit of you
know more going on on this side then yes
I pretty much and I've done this look
similar to and it's but it seems like
when I do like something has like a
really tall bang or a lot of hair I feel
like my makeup don't feel complete
unless it's a darker lip because I did
this like started this video and I just
had like a nude lip and it was so cute
in person but it was atrocious on camera
I'm still not like a no makeup looks
right now to be totally honest with you
but anyway that's not here
there too the actual hair itself I do
like the body way of it I'm just not a
big fan of the frontal because the
frontal I know this has a lot of these
flyaways in it and sometimes when they
pluck when they actually put the hair in
the frontal they'll do like a row of
long ones you know long like a row of
short ones then alone yeah so sometimes
this happens and in real life it happens
so it is not something that leg bothers
me like crazy because only I have to do
is just take some hairspray is it'll go
away but it's just best just one of
those things now I told you I left the
bleach on for not that long for my
frontal so I'm gonna give you our
close-up a with a little leg so this is
after having bleach on my not for about
20 minutes and it didn't really live as
you can see see right here
you can still see there my knots or a
little bit on that a lot of it on the
dark side so this is usually what you're
here we look like can see it bleach like
back here I'm good but riding that
hairline it seemed like it didn't really
want to bleach like that couldn't
explain this to why that was I did what
I could when I was giving some brush I
had to brush this piece out cuz I put a
whole bunch of hairspray so that it was
stay on this side and it was a rough
brushing it up cuz y'all know I like to
use that maximum hold okay the actual
frontal itself okay aside from the knot
situation was actually pretty good I
haven't been having major frontal issues
I haven't had any major front plate cuz
I didn't experience because I wear my
wings like on and off one and off on and
off I didn't really start to experience
like frontal shedding until as of
recently because some of my units that
I've had I've been kind of like wearing
them out or whatever case in point
melody I wore that to the point where I
have to make a new one
cuz I literally wore it out but it's
part like but I like my my frontal was
starting to shed a little bit but as far
as this goes and I've had this hair for
over six months at this particular point
and this is the one I like to pop one
what I musta like wear like a blazer or
it's like a dinner or something my hair
isn't just so big and unruly kind of has
some structure to it so it doesn't feel
like I'm just a hood right you know so
this particular hair as far as my
frontal goes I haven't had any Shetty
issues like that and I parted this hair
on this side I'm worried on this side
I've worked in the middle part it's kind
of been all over the place but the hair
itself the same thing I haven't
experienced globs of shedding or feels
like and then if you look at it -
because it is three bundles it does feel
weight fuller and that's because when I
did do the cross because so what I did
was I went and pin curls all the hair
upwards so that when I would go through
it it would give me this nice like
bounce going on here but I did it when I
was straightening the hair so I kept it
in its original body wave state except
for the top because I can't just like do
you know how the body great roots go you
know so I couldn't do that but I just
went ahead and did it put a little bit
of light holding spray on it because
when I did it I was gonna do it in the
middle part in our opted against it
because I just didn't you couldn't see
my face and there's something weird
going on with the lighting up in here
but I just look like this okay very the
rock about it so then like that now what
I will say is not let's take the frontal
part out the actual hair part bleach is
like a journey so if I was you I would
use this particular body wave to go
ahead and bleach and this could be the
fact that they did say that this was
virgin hair so that could be another
reason why it's very easy to pick a
color it didn't happen you know that
really horrible smell to it were you
it's y'all know y'all know I've heard
more stories and I've had a few myself
but it doesn't have anything like it has
a very fresh kind of pretty much no
smell smell where it just is it smells
clean it smells like you know the hairs
of quality it feels good and you can run
your finger through even though I've put
some holding spray in it it does go
through so that's the great thing as
well because you know what let me tell
you I got this one way that I made it
and then it was
all good and then I did this and it was
like a tumbleweed okay so it doesn't
leave can withstand hair a lot of
hairspray as well as keeping its luster
and its fluffiness cuz I haven't really
put nothing and it's because I haven't
really wanted to disturb the hair is
because I like to say that was in when I
received it like the S shape of course
it was really nice but at the same time
I just didn't want to have to do a whole
bunch of training because if that's the
case I might as well just wore that
straight hair you get what I'm saying
and I didn't want to do that I want it
to be a because I'll do this style with
straight hair but this like all the
dishes because I have played the pin
pearls in it and then left them
overnight and then took them out and
then went from here so as far as the S
shape that you get it falls out so keep
that in mind - it's not gonna stay
forever you can do the flexi rod method
if you choose or you could do what I did
which was the brick pattern of pink
curls and once you take them out it's
gonna fall it's gonna be very very
pretty the only thing about it is it
does fall out as well so this is after
about two days a day and a half and this
is kind of how I was looking at this
point it was much bigger and more
voluminous when I originally obviously
took them out but again the elements it
was a hundred and eleven degrees today
okay okay I'm sure I should be happy for
just this okay um but yeah that's
probably it it's not it's again I just
want to like take this time out to say
the Aliexpress y'all need to find a new
pattern that ain't body wave because
every time I get hit up for a review
this is what they're asking me to review
what this is one of our best sellers
okay but I already done it you don't
sound like I want something that
different so we got kind of find
something else to do I think you know
what be really nice cuz I get this often
let's work on really good curly hair
that doesn't
the doesn't tangle that is it Mangal but
doesn't end up in the tumbleweed let's
do that and then also can we work on
some 6:13 hair at a very low price that
us people who want to save a whole bunch
of money and I have to break the bank to
buy a thirteen by six sixteen 36 by 36
13 frontal lesson in 2018 I plan on
going back to wigs by the way just
regular leave but anyway um I just want
to be able to get a nice amount of
parting face with this I don't have any
parting sprays it stops literally right
here my truck is right here if you was
like next to me you can look down at my
truck because I it's short like and
especially I don't think people get like
when you get frontals in this area it's
longer and then when you get down it
starts to curve down like such this does
to be glued by the way but when it comes
down to your parting space sometimes you
have to go ahead and sacrifice the
holstege no oh look what a traction or
two in orders for your part to look
somewhat real you guys know I hate those
very fake looking parts and I hate when
they me like bad plank girl I can't even
put a curve in a part because my tongue
I start to turn it hit stop but yeah I
just would like Aliexpress and just all
the brands on there who are watching
just understand we are tired of the same
exact thing I've done it I've done it
I've done it I want to do color I want
to do some nice curly bushy stuff I'm
gonna get my Beyonce on I want to be
with to bleach my curly hair without
it's falling out something so my message
to everybody on Aliexpress let's do
something new in 2018 for my actual like
rating for this hair
I'll give it a seven and a half just
because I'm not a fan of the frontals
bleaching process and that's a huge
thing because you want it to look
natural from this angle
probably COO but if somebody look like
I'm right here girl they can't be like
this no dark dark not and I don't you
know and again I used the best products
that I know which are not cheap so not
really sure as to why this didn't bleach
and I'm not gonna try again just because
I just don't feel like it's necessary
and then on top of that its body weight
so body wave is anybody who's doing by
in mind you I've had this hair for over
six months so when I agreed to this
review it was so long ago but now as I'm
going through and getting reviews out
it's just becoming so like every time I
put up a video it's body wave I'm over
it we have to do something else
so they'll get a seven for me just
really for what it is but if you do want
some body wave hair like such go ahead
knock yourself out it ain't terrible you
know it is what it is it's what you've
been saying so if you was looking for
something new
so but just know the next review I do
will be nothing like this and it's body
wave but it's nothing and I'm nothing
like this so I hope you guys enjoy my
review / mini rant and I will catch you
guys in my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
