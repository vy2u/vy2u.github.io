okay so can we just talk about this
length because I really like it so and
it's blunt at the end if you guys can't
tell you for I get it well it was blown
we're not cut it but it starting to look
like layers now whatever but I'll get to
all of that in a second
so this hair that I am currently they're
rocking is from a company that I've
never worked before
called I think it's HJ weave Beauty this
is what the logo looks like through this
and um they contacted me quite some time
ago to do a review good but you guys
know that I just got my tooth pulled so
I was recovering from being fat-faced so
um the hair specs of this little
situation right here so I'll pull all
the hair for first to kind of show you
guys what it looks like and I am only
rocking three bundles people can you
believe me in three okay yeah so I cut
this into a blunt situation however
clearly I didn't do such a hard job
because now it looks like layers it
looks bad to a promise you look way
better when I first got it however I
didn't try it on when I did it and
somebody's hair was behind me so we're
going to kind of cheated was one of
these okay
so I kind of look like this when I first
cut it if that was what I was going for
um so I'm we're rocking three bundles so
I have in a twenty eighteen and a 16
with I believe which is a 14 inch
closure so the first thing we're going
to talk about is my closure because I
had the most irritable time with this
closure okay
a so I kind of actually moved so that's
not my country look low Genki excuse
that but it's like 2:30 in the morning
so my closure when I received it you
guys that are currently watching this
season of Love &amp;amp; Hip Hop you guys have
seen I'll put a picture of Remy Ma part
okay that is one of the cleanest parts
and the skinniest parts that I've ever
seen in closure history this is not a
good example of what real parts look
like and here is the reason why I don't
like lace frontals or closures for the
most part frontals are a little bit
different but our closures mark closure
I don't remember what dimensions this
closure is per se but it's actually much
smaller
it's literally probably like this much
then my normal size closures so it's one
of those very very small closures when a
lot of times I get caught well not even
a lot of times a lot of times when I can
closures and I never understand this
question and I get it but I just don't
understand why you want to do this
people ask me is this a free party or
it's like a three-part closure and what
that means is you can buy a closure with
a part already in it and then that way
you just slow it down and then hero fall
where it may I don't like to buy
closures like that and this closure came
like that because it does not look
natural they pluck the part a butcher so
it should be a video here to show you
what it look like before I actually went
through and plugged it I plucked the
hair line and then I actually plug the
actual closure part and I pluck this so
that some of the hair would be a little
sparse here and I'm saying just to kind
of make it look like a real person's
part and again with any hair that you
get doesn't matter you're always going
to have to tweak whatever you get
especially when it comes to frontal
enclosures so that was one thing that I
actually had to do that I haven't done
in a long time and this is the first
time in the history of me reviewing here
that I've ever had this issue where I
got a pre-existing part in a closure
that was like a stitch okay people
dude what hers look like I'm loving your
problem don't do it to you
so to my hair so I only have three
bundles in all three bundles were
constructed beautifully they all were
very silky they're all were very soft um
they just wasn't as soft as I would have
liked per se I do think the hair is
gorgeous and I'm losing the hair is very
flowy however um maybe I'm just used to
a certain type of hair because it's here
it can it was like very kind of rough or
whatever before I flattened it after I
flat ironed it it was it was great so
maybe that's what it was I don't know
the Brazilian here I rarely rarely ever
get shedding issues and it was the same
for this I got no shedding with this
particular hair um my ends were actually
the reason why I opted to do kind of a
blunt cut on this because the ends of
his hair uh I just didn't really like
them so I decided to chop them off and
usually you just trim them and if I
wanted to do like more of a blunt cut
limbs I might end up doing it might end
up going to like here or whatever and it
might actually be at an angle in the
back I don't know yet cuz I just wanna
kind of see how I feel about this um
I've been rocking this here for a minute
so it just depends on like where I want
to go with this I don't want to color it
because I do like this look I think it's
very cute and you guys know I'm used to
doing straight hair usually if it's a
middle part a soup it's like super long
like this so to have something stop
right here um it's a little bit
different it's something that I'm not
used to are not used to being singing
and opted for something a little bit on
a different size so I'm just so normal
nothing crazy it's not pink and bullet
it's still um or yellow or green implant
but it's definitely um something a
little bit different I will say that the
hair is very nice and for the prices
that they're charging again it's out
express can't really expect the world
but for the price and what they're
giving you I feel like this hair would
actually be something that's very decent
um this is the type of hair especially
with three bundles which you guys know I
am NOT a three bundles type of person
but uh
shot however um I do like it I think
that it's very natural okay people I'm
listening to you and you're saying can
you be a little more natural with the
bundles so natural my makeup not so much
but my hair yeah I do like the natural
look I do like the natural length and
this is a good kind of everyday fun you
guys just know that most of us who are
weave aficionados we do like a lot of
hair
it's just its nature we do like a whole
lot of hair the closure actually aside
from the park issue that I had with it
and actually late very nice um as you
guys can see it's not giving me no lumps
no bumps no uh no shading issues the
lace color was a little off um more so
than I'm used to this our legs seem to
be a little bit darker than what I'm
accustomed to so I had to cut a lot of
it off which I stopped doing to a lot of
my closures and because I've been
wearing more frontals than closures as
of now with all my newer hair that's
coming um and I don't know I just maybe
I don't know what mm-hmm
what I would like is for frontal this
would have been so banging with a nice
frontal so I want to try three bundles
in a frontal maybe similar to this maybe
a little bit shorter maybe a little bit
color I know I have some actually Umbra
here that um I just just finished
constructing like I want to say like
last week or a week before so um being
kind of figuring out what style I'm
gonna do with that as I'm kind of
putting it through the the tests so
we'll see if I'll do with that because I
actually does have a frontal on it
um beer if you guys are interested in HJ
beauty kinda sounds like a beauty supply
um but if you guys are interested in his
hair uh yeah check the links below the
prices are very good they're very
reasonable um I haven't had any personal
issues with the hair per se at all I
think that it actually is
some nice Brazilian air you know I don't
it hasn't given me no shading issues it
didn't smell like anything thank God I
had to system here back yesterday
because it's smelled like a lake and
some feet in God know so yeah if you
guys are interested like I said kick it
below and I'll let you know how this
goes but yeah would you guys feel about
the cut what you guys feel about the
live you know are you feeling this on me
do you like it so you kind of not like
it mmm let me know good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
