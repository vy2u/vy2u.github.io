no so um first off I want to say uh

it's alright though cuz I change my name
I'm good but I want to thank everybody

appreciate you guys even though I forgot
about it like after like a week of doing
it um but I did not forget about the
winner the winner of my contest is her
name is ahmed lo swag mi z z li l SW a
GG and she is the winner of the free
looks addiction case on me and looks
addiction and just hit me up on here or
Twitter and I will provide you with the
coupon code for you to claim your prize
thank you for instant home there and
your icon is cute so we're gonna talk
about hair care products today okay
because people wanted to know a few
things about the things that I use in my
hair and um what would be suggestions
and things of that nature so we're gonna
get to that right now
and some people ask me all the time just
because I broke our braids all the time
and they asked me do my braids break out
my hair and no Tiffany is very uh gentle
with my hair and my braids and I only
keep them in for two weeks at a time I
do not keep them in any longer than two
weeks because when you do that dirt I
have dry scalp and dirt and me do not go
when it comes to Moscow nothing is worse
than your pillow stinking okay so let's
start off the first thing the most
noticeable thing that is my baby here
okay and as some of you guys have went
out and got with this day aloe Fantasia
jail and this one is a hard to hold
which is the pink super hold this works
good on your edges it's flake-free it
holds all day and it smells really good
so this is actually there
product this product is $4.99 so where I
say is $4.99 it may be more it may be
less depending on where you stay so I
would recommend this to anyone who
actually uses gel on a daily basis or
every so often another thing people ask
me about is when my hair was straight
when did I have on my edges I had two
things on my edges one of the things I
don't have because if you guys know
Tiffany my hairstylist does my hair at
the shop so she has some items that I
don't hear half that she does use on my
hair and I will be purchasing um there
is a product by olive oil called edge
control and it works wonders on
anybody's hair
trust me but I actually do use this wax
which is the TGI I mean TIG is Friday I
mean for know Idid how I wax the wax
stick and the wax actually looks like
this it's like just a stick or whatever
and it comes out and Tiffany actually
uses this for my braids when she raised
my hair she used this and what people
need to realize is people say your
razors will need or like you know what
did it first off Tiffany is she draws so
she actually is very good with her lines
I guess you could say and another thing
as well is that when you're doing
someone's hair when someone's braiding
your hair the wax or the grease or
whatever they're used into is gonna
determine how the braid looks along with
their skills of braiding and the
tightness of how their braiding but the
wax basically it's so stiff what it does
is it helps the braid stay in place and
it makes the braids last longer and
here's another tip as well after she
braids my entire head you guys know the
mousse that they used for women who have
shorter hair we use that mousse to put
over my entire head we wrap them with
some black wraps and I sit under the
dryer so when I take this off all of the
little hairs that she didn't
are able to lay down and you can
actually see the design much better so
she just doesn't braid my hair and I get
up and leave actually sit under the
dryer for about 45 minutes under cool to
medium heat and let the little the
little hairs lay down so you can
actually see the design and lays
everything down so my hair is looking
really really nice and this wax actually
works really really good but the this
may be a problem for some people because
this wax is $18.99 so it's definitely
not cheap but it actually works and
actually is a really good product so it
depends on you somebody's products for
an Archie um when I did that alia curls
video another product that people always
want people were noting as your product
but they were asking me what did I use
in my hair and what I used was this
which was the average gloss therapy now
this is the exact I just looked at this
before I did this video this is the
exact same one from that video and this
is how you know how long I've had this
it was only $6.99 and it's the last me
like two years I mean I'm not even near
finished
and it's not even expired to it so yeah
this is great
um but yeah it's just sorry you can use
this two ways you can put this in your
hair when you're after you blow I mean
after you wash and condition and you
still wet you can put in your like a
like a nickel sized running through your
hair blow-dry it and give it a nice
shine so when you press on flat iron or
well however you do your hair it has a
nice shine to it me personally I don't
use that because of the shampoo and
conditioner I'm about to show you it
actually gives it a natural shine so I
don't have to use this but if I do need
like a extra pick-me-up or once I get to
the point where my hair is straight and
I've had it straight for like a week and
a half and it's not looking so bouncy
and cute anymore I'll put like a half of
dime size of this in my hands and
running through my hair and it'll give
me my shine back be careful with using
this though you guys because what it is
is this stuff is
greasing it works but it's highly greasy
so if you use too much if you have a
weave your natural hair whatever the
situation is it's gonna make your hair
greasy and that's greasy pressed greasy
wrap ain't high that ain't hot that is
not okay
so shampoo and conditioner you can use
cream of nature
I've used this I only use this so this
is the two-in-one this is a detangling
and shampoo shampoo conditioning shampoo
okay so this is really good for me
I personally don't wash my own hair I
have Tiffany do it because I have so
much of it and when I'm actually if I
wash my hair in the shower I have to
lean forward and leaning forward for
that long to watch that much freaking
hair makes me lightheaded and that's not
a good selling so I usually have her do
it if she doesn't like if I'm in the
midst of it or my hair because I have
dry scalp if my hair just flaked up so
bad it just gets nasty
um I need something if I'm take my hair
out the night before Tiffany does not
take our Birds um then I'll pre wash it
myself and I'll probably use this or
whatever but do at the shop what she
actually uses on my hair is this and
this is a line called Giovanni's and you
can purchase this at Whole Foods
it's an all-natural product and these
are really really really good now for
the longest con I was using swab for my
shampoo and conditioner and it had
effect on my hair because I had to cut
like five when she actually got to me
seven even doing my hair for like the
last five years um and she's telling me
to stop using that because it's drying
out your hair really really bad and it's
starting to make it break off and that's
the last thing that you want you have
nice hair why are you trying to you know
like this is not good so this is the
all-natural product it has no sulfate in
it
this has sulfate in it and sulfate is
basically what gets the dirt out it is
basically like dishwashing liquid and
most most um products like this they
clarify but they don't deposit moisture
and if you don't have moisture within
your hair your hair is gonna be very dry
and it's not gonna move like it should
move and eventually it's gonna start to
break with this it actually has a meter
on the back of each bottle and it tells
you right here it tells you the
clarifying and the moisture and this is
right in the middle because this is the
50/50 balance line of it so I get
hydrated and clarifying so basically it
deposits and it clarifies at the same
time now the reason why I was using swab
for my hair is because of the simple
fact that I have a lot of it and I
needed a lot of conditioner because I
would use certain conditioners that were
good but they wouldn't they wouldn't
lather correctly I guess you could say
cuz conditioner it really doesn't lab
everybody you know what I mean like it
wouldn't spread through the hair enough
well I've had you know they would work
so I have to use a lot of it so I use 12
because swab was cheaper it was like a
dollar for your not I can get like seven
bottles and be okay with this particular
mind you both of these bottles are on my
phone so long without but with this it's
so thick and it spreads so good this
bottle lasts me two months of pre
washing my hair and I get my hair done
every two weeks I get my hair we Brady
and he says it's not even going yet this
is a great product that he's brought
both of these are like $8.99 apiece and
they have if you don't have dry scalp
they have one from moisture they have
they have so much stuff this is a really
great line and I think it's only
available it may be available a beauty
supply but the only place I personally
know where to get it is arm Whole Foods
now if you can't afford that which is I
mean it is pricey though between the wax
I didn't just showed you like 40 40 50
dollars worth this bug you can actually
use these which is the mint lavender tea
tree shampoo and conditioner now I'm not
a I don't I'm not like a big big fan of
these but for a budget these actually
work because these are about the same
price as one of these and but the only
thing about this is these actually come
with more in them and those do but these
are
and tea tree is actually really good for
people with dry scalp like myself but I
don't use tea tree actually anymore
because I've gotten to the point where
my skull was actually okay and it's
actually doing good cuz at first it was
so nasty it was just gross
and actually the last thing that I use
or hairspray now I know a lot of you
guys use a lot of you guys who are
african-american you guys use pump it up
and African pride and all of those hair
sprays for your hair well the truth
about those products is they are taught
they are tailored towards African
Americans but they are very harmful to
your hair because they are loaded with
alcohol if you buy a product before you
buy any product for your hair always
look at the ingredients on the back and
beauty school that's something that I've
held with me ever since because that
tells you what's in the product you
don't have to get home and say I got a
whole bunch of alcohol that I don't know
it's gone you can read the bag before
you even purchase it that's why it's
there but what I use instead of using
those products don't work for me they
may work for you but they person they
don't work for me only thing that they
do is they wear and tear and dry out my
hair so that don't work but I use this
which is the Tresemme professionals and
this is the mega firm control I mean
from mega firm hold and it is in this
freeze v basically is the most points
are at high as they go I guess you could
say and this actually works really good
as aerosol and it holds but it um it
holds but it's flexible you know so if I
want to do the Kardashians that I can do
it in my hair actually move like the
Kardashians it won't be stiff like
Shawna Jackson and the hood when my hair
is just stiff and it doesn't move this
actually gives me flexibility um and it
actually holds it in my hair is thick
it's not processed so I need something
that's not gonna make my hair revert and
usually alcohol does that to your hair
African Americans and makes your hair
revert so your hair looks
happy at the root and in every so often
you'll have to run a person home or a
flatiron to it so it can look like
something that's not what you want
that's a lot of heat and there's a lot
of wear and tear on your hair now I'm
gonna give you guys a few tips that
actually helped me cutting your ends are
very important people forget to cut
their hands all the time or they don't
want to kind of cut something they're
gonna cut the hair off I just did it
recently um
and I do it probably every four months
or whatever not every six months like
every four months I'll actually get a
nice amount of my hair cut off at the
bottom because it grows back so much
better but you guys have to realize
about ends in fact they are split
they're gonna continue to split and
they're gonna split to the roots when I
get to the root you are you might
as well go Amber Rose with it because
it's no saving your hair at that point
so catch it before it gets there
if your hair is here and this much of
that needs to be cut off just cut it off
because your hair's gonna feel better
it's going to look better you're gonna
feel better
and you're gonna see when your hair
starts to grow back in that the part
that you cut that's healthy will be at
the bottom now so all of this looks good
as a unit now it isn't like it's cute
until you get to here then it starts to
get puffy that's not what you want ain't
nothing hot about that another thing is
that you can't get the grease out of
your hair don't use dishwashing liquid
use lemon fluff it's much better and
less harmful to your hair and another
tip as well if you do have leaves make
sure when you wash your weaves you wash
them in cold water not hot water as well
as when you have your conditioner and
you wash your conditioner out wash your
conditioner out with cold water do not
use hot water because you are washing
out the product which you are wasting
your money the when you you guys should
know the laws of water at this point
hot opens the pores co closes the pores
so if you rinsed that with cold water is
going to lock the conditioner in makes
your hair much luminous luminous and
basically it's going to basically
deposit into the hair shaft
and make your hair look much better and
keep your scalp much moisturize much
longer if you put hot water it's gonna
dry out your scalp and more such a
product basically and you're
um excuse my language for this but it's
how I roll and I think that's about it
for um for this particular a crash
course in hair care but yeah I mean you
guys have any questions please feel free
to ask them on I will be replying to
this video about that indeed and I will
list all the products that were seen in
this video at the bottom and I will talk
to you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
