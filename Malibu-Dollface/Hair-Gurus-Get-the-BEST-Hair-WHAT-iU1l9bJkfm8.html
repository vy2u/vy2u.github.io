video that has to do with hair because I
think this will be the perfect time to
do so because this is something that I
think people don't really understand
about hair reviews and hair reviewers
and how things work I'm not gonna really
get too into depth about the situation
but what I will say is this people think
that we the gurus get all the good hair
and then some companies not all but some
companies will send the consumer you
know you guys to pay your heart or money
the bad hair the the shedding hair the
you know the not of quality hair and
that married a very well might be the
case for some companies since I've been
reviewing hair hardcore there are a lot
of companies that I will not work with
not because I have anything personally
against them but because sometimes their
customer service is not the best for
people that I am speaking to which is
you my audience this is white label hair
if you ain't know my review should
already be up for this also keep this in
mind guys as well when you guys see a
lot of us with our hair installed that's
mean that means that we've have said for
hours to make it look like this
it didn't come like this like for
instance this hair didn't come big like
this it came very uniformed and I had to
brush it out and install it correctly so
that it could look right so there's a
lot of factors that go into your hair
such as your install which you put on
the hair if you do put anything on the
hair how you care for the hair how
you're maintaining it that all comes
into question when you say how good is
the hair if you're taking it right off
the box and it's already giving you a
problem then that means you should send
it back but it's not true there are so
many companies that hit me up to ask me
to do hair reviews and there are so many
companies that I cannot either reply to
or I just will not work with because
they have a bad track record with people
who said that this is that the other now
everybody's issues that they've had in
the past I don't really look at because
you know people make mistakes
so if it's a company who's made a
mistake and they're trying to fix her
mistake that's completely different
because I still believe in with the
product that they're trying to promote
and sell to my core audience so you know
that's what a lot of times I try to give
you guys coupon codes and stuff like
that let's try to keep the
writes down because hair is very
expensive and it's a very lucrative
business and they seem like everybody
and their mama got a hair company but
know just know this from a person who
does hair reviews there's way more hair
that I send back then there's hair that
I review because if their hair if I get
it and the hair is bad or it's giving me
a problem off the RIP I'll hit the
company up and say listen I don't even
think I want you to fix this situation
and I don't want to do a video to bash
your company because whatever my
experience may be with you may be
completely different from somebody else
actually up the street probably got some
bomb banging hair and she loved it and
she raving about it on Instagram that
may not be the same case for me so I
would just rather cut my losses I don't
want to say anything bad about nobody's
company so understand just because you
don't see me work with the company that
doesn't mean that the company has not
hit me up now I'm sure that they have a
lot of them do and you know when
somebody gets to a certain point where
they can promote your product yeah your
your inbox is gonna be flooded with
these people but I don't always say yes
to everybody and I don't always take
everything that's given to me because if
the product is wack I'm not gonna sit up
here and say yeah this hair and shedding
and it's bad and it's because it makes
me look bad even though it's the truth
it still makes me look bad I don't
always have to say anything and you'd be
like oh this company is real popular why
don't you work with them nine times out
of ten there's a reason why I'm not
working with that company there's a
reason whether it be their hair their
customer service there's been companies
in the past who have rushed me to do
reviews and I said okay well which we're
going to do is we're gonna send the
Rickerson hair back and I'm not gonna do
anything and then we're gonna call a
spade a spade cuz I don't like to be
rushed into something if I've had hair
that's been in for only a week then I'm
like alright that's enough time for me
to figure it out because usually what
I'll do is I'll wear the hair for a week
then review the hair after that for a
week so by the time you guys get the
review I've already worn a hair for
about a good six to seven to eight days
just to see how good it is and if it
work or not you know I'm saying if it's
going to shed or not that's how can
everybody give you a detailed review
about the hair that I'm wearing is
shedding matte or anything this hair
ain't on me
no no no you know that's kind of how you
got to think about it I understand that
it's hard for you guys to believe
everybody's work because there are gurus
out there that will work with anybody
and take any hair and rave about it and
we'll never put it on again I clearly
I'm not that person cuz y'all haven't
seen the same wigs
I don't know homie that dev RPG show it
with the middle part that is gonna be
that forever and always my Italian
Yankee I've wore that like crazy my red
wig like I wear these things often and
over and over and over and over and over
again so just understand that it's not
all gurus who do this and just because
you got to see somebody like somebody
the reason why I wanted to do this video
is because somebody I posted a picture
of another company that I'm doing after
this one and they were like um I don't
like their hair and I forgot what what
it was that they had said and then went
into cuz gurus get good care and we get
the bad hair and I'm thinking to myself
like it's really sad that people who
have no prior knowledge of this really
believe that to be completely 100% true
for everybody it's like you're taking
all gurus and saying they all up here
and we're all down here and we get the
good they get the good hair and we don't
know I've got hair that was funky I've
got here that was shedding I got here
that was matted I've got hair that was
horrible I've gotten hair from company
that day my wigs have been crooked they
have been cut wrong I have everything
that you can think of I remember one
time I got a bundle of hair from a
company a very popular company mind you
very popular and they sent me four
bundles of Brazilian curly hair and
every last bundle was Beauty big buck
shop nappy and I'm like what kind of
hair is this supposed to be like yaki
and it was like oh no this is this is
our Brazilian natural you know the names
is what killed me you know people will
market their hair in a certain way and I
mean that's pretty like that's anything
if you go and look at tablet's apples
gonna say they got the best tablet on
the market but then Samsung might have
one that's ten times better but it
depends on that's you you know I'm
saying is at the
today these are companies they're gonna
market their hair and the way in which
they feel like it's gonna sell so if
they say that it is a natural Brazilian
body wave then chances are it's not a
natural Brazilian nothing but it
probably is just Indian hair that's been
processed to a certain way and that's
your nah that's your knowledge to know
if this is authentic if this is not if
they're using of dog hair if they're
using you know I'm saying and that's
what we come in here for and there's
times where I've gotten here that I
could tell was not virgin hair
I knew off the RIP this was some bobby
basta they put a rubber band around put
their label on it sent it to me I know
the difference so I'm like I'm not doing
it cuz I'm not about to tell them that
this is some Brazilian here and it's not
okay so if I if I there's been a lot of
times in my reviews where I've told you
this hair says it's virgin but based on
the texture I don't think that is virgin
it probably was at a point but right now
I don't think that is virgin anymore
because the way that it's be balancing
and behaving and acting it's not it's
not that you know so please keep that in
mind we don't always get the best hair
we go through I think probably worse
than the consumer the only difference is
people feel it that way because it's
free we don't have to pay for it um but
a lot of times we're out of money
because we don't want the hair the
company wants us to keep the hair I'm
like I'm about to keep no trash hair so
I have to come out of my pocket and
start to you know get return labels
that's in their bag because I'm like I'm
not gonna do that that's one of the
reasons why I've yet to get a peel box
because I know a lot of my people who do
real reviews and a half peel boxes how
much hair that they get in their inbox
from companies that haven't even
contacted them to say anything they just
sent it off like review for us you know
a lot is it's it's a dog-eat-dog world
out here in this hair game trust and
believe that and I've definitely seen
that firsthand but yeah I just want you
guys to kind of feel secure I'm not one
of those people and I know my girl Ivy's
not that person they're my girl
look he is not that person like we you
know these are people that I know so you
know if it's bad we've had conversations
like I've gotten horrible hair you know
I'm saying this but it's a conversation
that this is not it's necessarily for
y'all because if I start
the amount of companies that I didn't
work with and it was a bad experience
for me then it makes you to consumer not
wanna mess with the company and they may
have made a mistake they may have done
something that was wrong and they're
trying to fix it but if I blackballed
their company it makes me look bad it
takes money out of their pocket and they
could very well have a really good
vendor who got them some bad hair you
know so I just keep that to myself I
just want review for them if you don't
see it on my channel then you know I
don't mess with it if you know if you
see it on my channel then you know that
I mess with it and I believe in the
product and I would never try to sell
you guys something that's not true
that's the bottom because I listen at
the end of the day if I see fergie
rockets and fly adidas and I gonna buy
those very same adidas and they look
nothing like hers the quality is way
less than hers and I'm like well why you
know I feel the way cuz I had to spend
my money she got him for free so why I
gotta pay my money for something that's
not even a quality I trust me I'm still
a consumer I still buy stuff I still get
it
trust me and $700 702 $1000 for hair is
not cheap so yeah remember that hope you
guys enjoyed this and I hope this kind
of gave you some of you guys some
clarity on the whole hair game and how
its branding you know I don't want to
get too deep in it but you giving them
saying all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
