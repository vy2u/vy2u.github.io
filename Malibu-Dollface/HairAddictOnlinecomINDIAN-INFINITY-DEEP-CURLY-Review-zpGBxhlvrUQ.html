set up right now the way this lipstick
is everybody's outfit is set up right
now I'm gonna go knock somebody in the
mouth I can't find my gloves I'm still
getting ready settled in from moving but
my hair is from hieratic okay so listen
I had some hair from hieratic
like two three years ago um I have some
hair from hieratic like a year ago that
I had actually purchased I wore um in
the video I never specified who it was
from I just I was wearing therefore
there was you can hear and I still have
it I still love it so you guys know if
you don't know um when I do reviews I do
not contact companies ever so if your
company watching is if you ever get an
email stating that I want to review for
you it's not me owning it contact me and
hear I did that and they wanted to know
if I would be open to a review of course
I am very familiar with their um their
company through a lot of my fellow
youtubers here a lot of my subscribers
who have been customers for years just
wanted to know like what my personal
opinion was of this hair so we discuss
she actually pretty much told me
anything you want you can have
so I actually laid my eyes on this
beautiful hair which is there um I think
it's the infinite the Indian infinity
curly please deep curly I believe that's
what it's called don't hold me but I
believe if you're looking at that I
don't know was right so um I received
the hair probably within like a week
span and I've had this hair for wait
longer than I had anticipated this
review is supposed to actually go up in
April and because of just other things
that I had going on and getting ready to
move I didn't have time to do it but I
had already made the wig I made the wig
since I lived in my other part of it so
I've had this for quite some time and I
will say I this is the most pleasant
I've been with curly hair a lot of times
you guys notice our a lot of body wave
hair because it kind of gives me this
not as the loom
but it'll give me something that isn't
straight but it gives me a bit of a
texture this hair has been washed
co-wash I've diffused it
I've never blow-dried it and I haven't
put any heat to it because I just don't
believe in putting heat into my curly
hair because I feel like no matter how
great the hair is after a while it's
pretty this beautiful look goodness
texture will pretty much be gone so I
cannot remember for the life of me what
my bundles are but I'm going to
guesstimate at this particular point and
their limbs work because they usually do
them a scale between 1 and 1 so pretty
much I believe I'm wearing between two
28 and 26 and I think I have another um
between 23 26 and 24 and I believe my
closure is 18 inches so I did they
didn't have a frontal which is my only
thing that I was just so about because
this with the half-up half-down would be
everything but I can't do it because I
only unfortunately have a lace closure
but it still looks amazing so when I
look at the hair and I put it on and I
was playing in it um I actually was
swimming with this hair because it's
been hot as write recently and I wanted
to see how the hair would hold up with
chlorine because chlorine is depending
on the pool you get in a hair harmer a
lot of times and especially for curly
hair it'll cause it to nap up and
because it's chlorine this is bleach you
know is it's so I wanted to see what it
would do with that and this is what you
got so yeah so you guys know I'm a last
review that I did my hair was I actually
wore that hair wet and I'm with this
hair and curls beautifully when it's wet
it looks more like here in the front
it's just very uniform ringlet curl but
I've noticed that I'm just one of those
people I really prefer my curly hair to
be very dry not very dry but to stay dry
like this so this big and it's
voluminous and I don't have to wait for
it to dry the back of my short isn't wet
and it just gives me this big Chaka Khan
Diana Ross feel
which I absolutely love I have had very
minimal shedding I've had cheating but
it hasn't been crazy amounts I haven't
had balls of hair it's been a few
strands here and there but like I said
usually once you install it and I did
cut the West on this even though I could
have folded them I did not actually cut
them I'm just to see kind of how the
hair would do without me still in the
West and it's been great you guys know
when I told you when I have curly hair I
put it through the trenches because I
want to see if it's actually going to
last this hair hasn't given me much of
an issue at all besides a little bit of
shedding that I've received which is
pretty very normal for curly hair it
keeps it's curly from the root all the
way down now my closure isn't because it
is a closure so usually you know you get
a bit of straightness here at the front
and then it starts to get curly down
here but if you would like to do
something different you want to our
curly just take a wand
take like the two inches of the wand and
just curl the roots and then pull them
like spring them and they'll spring back
and I was gonna just gonna look super
duper curly but I do kind of like the
relaxed look here here at the top and I
just pretty much did the flip over I
just pulled it into one direction
I did not bleach my front so I mean see
on the frontal I did not bleach my
closure because I felt like you're not
going to see any of the parting
due to the simple fact that I'm gonna
wear a big with the flip over so was
that extra was so unnecessary um but I
will say I will say you guys know I've
been doing this a lot to kind of tell
you what my favorite is as far as um
hair goes this is my favorite I kid you
freaking not my favorite curly hair okay
this hair is amazing I've had some hair
before this that I actually colored blue
and it definitely reminds me of that
because every single time I put any
conditioner any like water anything on
the hair it curls to its natural and it
is so pretty when it's wet I don't have
unfortunately any pictures of my hair
while it's wet because I don't think I
did I didn't reward like
I've only wore it in this natural state
I did not let this drip dry I actually
let it I use a diffuser because I just
brought it no one's other reason and
usually because it's a lead to a like
buy one get one free and it came with a
free diffuser for the blow dryer that I
brought so why not and this is the look
that I got so it gave me this very big
voluminous curly hair a lot of times um
after you have curly hair for so long it
will start to droop and it won't be this
big it'll kind of come to here after a
while but no I've had this hair they
said that I think in March so it's March
April May June so July is coming up and
yeah so and I've wore this hair a lot
and when I say a lot I mean a lot and I
told you guys once before when I'm
reviewing here I do not post pictures on
social media of the hair while I'm
testing it out because if for whatever
reason the hair does not work out and it
becomes a problematic problem I will
send it back and give it back to the
company so we could either make an
exchange of some sorts because maybe it
was just a bad batch and or we're just
not going to fall through with the
review which then people are going to
ask me about her that they seen on
social media that I probably would never
review so that's why I keep those
pictures away until I'm ready to tell
you my honest feelings about it and I
honestly love this hair so here at if
you guys get an A plus plus plus plus
plus buzz buzz um from me uh because you
guys know I do a lot Alex first reviews
and a lot of times with that hair I'm
super duper disappointed um you guys
should just see the amount of reviews
you don't see in the amount of hair that
I have to send back because I just hate
it so I've had that issue a lot with
curly hair and trying to find some
decent curly hair that is not gonna
droop but it's not gonna be bad and this
y'all this is summertime fine okay when
I got about that pool was a moment so if
you guys are interested make sure you
guys um click the link below I have in
again I'm just going to guesstimate here
because I do not remember because it's
been so long and I do not know where the
cards are for this there's somewhere in
here packed down so I don't know but I
believe I have between 26 and 28
two of those and I think I
between 24 and 26 two of those and I
believe I have a either 18 or 20 inch
arm closure but if something does change
um make sure you guys check the link
below and I'll have the exact I just hit
the owners up to ask them exactly what
there's been a minute and I do not
remember exactly what those are so if
you're going for this specific look
please be patient um and I'll notate it
somewhere in the description at this is
the exact bundles that I have if you're
going for this look so I will catch
y'all yes in my next woman and not Sarah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
