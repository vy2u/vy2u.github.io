don't you know I live for you
listen don't you know I live you so this
is the inside of the wig as you can see
my middle part was actually a side part
I put in and I just turned it but it
comes with three combs at the top as you
can see and these are easy to put into
your braids and then this is the
adjustable strap in the back I never
really cut the lace off the back because
I never put my hair up in a ponytail but
yeah and this is what the part look like
with a little bit like a baby's so this
wig yo it's from a company that I've
never worked with before but it's called
hey hair to the Queen
oh can we talk about the box I'm already
when I received the Box I was like I'm
using this with something else and not
too strongly
okay this is some really good like solid
presentation and one of you already like
it because it reminds me of this
Flatiron so this is a platter I got from
a different company but works great but
anyway this box okay so you guys know
I've been looking for some nice red hair
like some nice original ginger hair and
this definitely is not it this is more
of my ratchet rate than it is like a
natural red but it is red now I
originally when I spoke with the company
I'm supposed to get a green wig so I
went from green to red I don't know how
but it did um but so far I really like
it there's only one hand up but this wig
that I really despise we'll get to that
at the end of the video so I'm gonna
give you the specs on before I get to
the specs i'ma show you what's in the
box so the inside of the box is lined
with this nice filter material and comes
with our card like such and then this
card has all of the information that you
need measure and then asana says the
return policy and replacement for the
product in case you do not like your
weight so this is some nice thick stock
paper usually it's a piece of paper this
this actually has like texture to it
like it's not something you can see but
I got a little texture to it like they
did a really good job I don't know if
this particular model is their model but
she's gorgeous
and yeah and it has a thank you on the
back for your purchase it also came with
you guys know it comes with the typical
lunch lady Ned and then it was wrapped
in this and inside name is packaged in
there and then it came with something
which is really rare it came with a pic
which I don't you know pics are usually
custom for afros not necessarily
straight here I can't do anything with
the pic with this hair but thanks okay
so because I don't know the specs by
heart we're gonna read them off okay
alright so this is hairstyle sc0 73 the
color is a red the length is a 20 inches
on 20 inches which is I believe is a
true 20 inches um the cap size is a
small it is AG Lewis cap my lace is a
light brown the hair Tex texture is a
yaki and it's free shipping on all wigs
and they have monthly specials which
should be down below now when I received
the wig it had it was definitely yaki it
looks silky on um camera because I
really flattened it and like really
really really really really laid it all
the way down so that it would lay down
like I wanted to but it was it had a lot
of texture to it
and not like my Italian yaki not texture
like that but it definitely had a
thickness to it so when you do flat iron
it does give you a nice flow now it
doesn't say what density this hair is
but I'm going to assume that the density
is a hundred percent and usually this is
the part where I would complain about
the density and not being enough but
because this wig I pulled it off for it
for you because the wig texture is a uh
I'm gonna say it's a light yaki it has
more of a natural feel to it so the lack
of super duper fullness doesn't bother
me because the hair texture is a little
bit thicker than silky hair so it feels
a bit fuller than normally so they
actually did a solid they did they did
it both ways good because they save
money and then you get the look that you
want without having for them to have to
pull more hair into the wig and there's
a full lace wig it is not a lace front
which kind of feels good to say because
it's been a minute since I've actually
had like just a full lace wig in a
straight style and I went ahead and did
the middle part cuz it's been a while
I've been killing the hell out of the UM
the side part I know people I know but
you know you just have your moments and
I don't think I've ever had great red
hair with the middle part I think it's
always been a side part so you know I
like it I love this the only thing now
let's get to the thing that I dislike
the most about the league the thing that
I dislike the most is in a winning
different roots and the roots look like
this and this is very bright of Chucky
because it stops there is a big line of
demarcation that goes around the entire
wig and I just I don't understand why
they would do that that's the only thing
that I hate because the hair texture is
great this is the first time I've had a
wig and I think a light yaki with a
color that has been this nice the only
thing is I'm have to wear hat with it
because until I fix the roots because
one it goes like a V and yeah they got
to get the coloring right with this
because they're supposed to be a nice
line of um just it's supposed to flow
into one another it's not supposed to be
this big line like I just took some
black color and one like this let it dry
any or instead so that's the one thing
about this wig that just irks my soul
because in such a pretty color and it
has such a pretty texture but that dye
job on the roots it is not supposed to
look like that and I have a red wig
somewhere I'm not gonna even attempt to
look for but I have I have you guys know
whenever I wear color head I have to do
a dark roots because my real hair is
bike so it's just
that's the only thing that I don't like
is these roots and of course I'm gonna
go back and fix it but I shouldn't have
to fix it that's the thing as a company
they have to be a little more mindful
about this is not going to work because
it isn't real
you know so if I'm a reviewer saying I
gotta go ahead and fix you know the
roots because it looks and it's not
gonna hurt it's not going to take long I
have to buy some box color you know they
have like the the easy touch-up roots
you use those and they give you the
little comb and you just go through and
do it but it shouldn't it should have
came perfect that's the point of the wig
so I have to do less work but other than
that my ramble too much about that
because I do really like the hair um
yeah that's my only hang-up
but the hair is great I did co-wash this
hair just to see if the color would run
because you know sometimes when you get
colored hair and then you kind of like
see if it's gonna bleed a little bit
it's sometimes your whole sink be red
but it actually wasn't I think this is
actually like not a cellophane color I
think this is an actual color color
color and yeah it's turned out to be one
of my favorite wigs I just got to put on
the headband or head cuz can't wear this
out like this I mean some people would
and probably wouldn't care know like
much about it like nobody got really
notice but because I am short this
everybody stands over me so that means
that everybody is looking at my hairline
in my part so that means you're going to
see what my hair looks like at the top
which sucks this hair is from pair of
Queens how take a look at their site
they actually have some really nice wigs
on there they're construction of their
wigs are very well and nice you know
sometimes I get construction I'm like
would whose head is this supposed to fit
but they actually do a good job and
their presentation is great yeah we
could say pay as much detail to these
roots as we do to this box we gonna be
on the summer a nice but I want to take
the company for giving me a chance to
review for them and um yeah I'll put all
the information to this particular week
below as well as the site in any coupon
codes that I had on
was a y'all tune and I would catch y'all
in my next Hey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
