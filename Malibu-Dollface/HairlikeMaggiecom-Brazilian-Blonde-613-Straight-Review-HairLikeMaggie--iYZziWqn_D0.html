though I've been home this whole time
but y'all ain't gone Rick girl my life
has been a mess
in a good in a bad way I've been able to
like kind of like sit and deal with life
but then I lost a tooth I got that
temporary I got a new one coming
sprained my ankle like girl with you
tryin to kill oh how do you guys like my
rainbow well as any a rainbow my more
unicorn hair well it's from hell I'm a
good girl just that though check the
foil though okay obviously my hair did
not come this color but I want to share
with you guys i'ma put a video right
here like how I was when I first first
got it which you know was a 613 now this
is what is left of the hair that I'd
like couldn't fit in or just didn't run
necessarily need a reason so this was
all of the bundles well the the last
little bit of the bundle that I had it
was quite a lot hate like a lot of hair
which I you know I'm always down for
some soon sooner they're moments but I
just love the amount of detail that she
put into the presentation of everything
the actual tissue paper has hair like
Maggie all over it as well as
as well as all of the models at the
bottom hey Cory greicy you bow and then
a detailed list of all of her pricing
for everything I was on this side she's
beautiful by the way I don't know who
she is but she's beautiful and she has
like her fronts was her closures you
know all of the things that she has
going on she has it on here all her
bundle deals for Cambodian Malaysian
Peruvian blonde you know raw virgin hair
Brazilian everything is on here so when
you receive your you get an option to
look at what else they have as opposed
to going to sometimes um beyond it's one
of people's websites is a little
annoying especially when they be trying
to be extra cute about it and it'd be
too much stuff on the site so I love
that she did this also it came with some
lashes from her called blink lashes now
unfortunately I already had this look
planned and they didn't I did not wear
these cuz I didn't go with this but I
will be wearing these which I think are
extremely can't and these are the blink
blink you very much which is so cute so
this is the packaging and how everything
looks when you receive your hair so I am
wearing I'm gonna pull my hair forward
so you can see all of the color what
love is it came out just how I wanted it
like it's the perfect amount of pink and
something perfect about a green a purple
so when I was coming up with this I was
like wait variation of unicorn hair do
you want like how do you want this to
kind of look type of thing and I was
like well I want pink and I want blue
but I don't want it to come off like
everybody else is so I was like I'm
gonna do Pink's but I'm gonna do like a
lighter pink so I use our doors cotton
candy for the top and then this color
right here this greenish bluish color is
aquamarine
then the actual green oh I forgot what
color green this is then the blue is a
baby blue and then the yellow isn't a
door at all this is another brand that I
don't recall which but it worked though
but they have it at Sally's I think it's
the salon care ones where you don't have
to put no developer in it or nothing
like that it's just in cellophane like
pretty much okay here we go so it's
actually the ion writes in lemon that's
what this yellow color here is at the
bottom so originally what I was gonna do
is I'm gonna take my hair you know make
the wig of course and then go ahead and
start the color but I had to make sure
that I did the wig prior to putting the
color on it because I wanted them to
actually blend together sometimes when
you juice and when you see people's hair
and they'll do it you can't tell you can
tell if they did it like separately and
just try to guesstimate and sometimes
that works but that's not what I wanted
so that's not what it is so I went ahead
and put all the color and I left my
color in for at least thing like two
days I just let it get hard and let it
get dry so that you know cool fine you
dandy whatever you know that you already
know how to get down like that so then
what happened was originally this was I
like the pink I let it get much Pinker
and then I put a blue streak in here you
know like look like like melody 2.0
that's what we were going for so I put a
picture here of what it looked like when
I did that and I hated it I didn't like
it it didn't come out the way I wanted
to I was very irritated and aggravated
by it so what I opted to do was I said I
went back so I went and got me some
color remover and I snatched all the
color out of the top of the frontal
because my frontal I'm wearing 228 and
230 so it's it goes 30 30 28 28 like
that and then I think my frontal is a 30
inch or was the 30 inch because you know
hooded eye searching by six girls Maggie
it's it she gets a girl's party back
the crown of my head girl so I went
ahead and did that and took the color
out I redid it hated it even more and
after the color out again and my parcel
did not at all
break burn catch fire or nothing baby is
still out here living in swirling honey
and she's blends and grow yeah but I
love the fact that cuz usually after a
while what's gonna happen is you do it
so many times I only use the 20 volume
to take the color out but out you do it
enough it'll fall out you know it'll
start to get thin and start to really
fall out on you and it did not do that
and I was so proud of her from eating
quality blonde hair because I'm gonna
tell you fine and 6:13 hair it's pretty
easy finding good qualities it starting
here now that's another question that's
another task so what I ended up doing
was I put the pink back on and I just
let it heat all pink but I concentrated
the pink towards the back and kind of
left the front of my hair a more of a
almost back to blonde I didn't want it
to go all the way back to being actually
pink like how my roots are much Pinker
and then it seems to almost be like a
super baby baby Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson type
of thing so then what I did was I do a
couple of layers in it and then curled
it and that was pretty that's pretty
self-explanatory so to my actual bundles
themselves so one of them so she sent me
four bundles and I like I said it was to
30s and then it was to 28 with the one
of my 30s I have to say that it was born
the dry side a little bit and that's
normal because usually when you get six
13 hair hair that has been pre lighted
because it doesn't all come from the
same person sometimes you're gonna end
up where the hair is a little bit dry
all the thing I did was put some
conditioner on it popped it in the
microwave and it was just like the rest
of them so that tends to happen so when
you first get here that's why it's
always better suggested that you co wash
your hair because then it'll make sure
that everything whatever was pointed
whatever was in it will be out of it and
you can
Louisiana performs and I've had this
hair for over three months okay
it's been my color this is my thing I
went to the club and what other wouldn't
everybody was asking me what hair was
and I had to tell them that it was hair
like Aggies because they was like words
the review I'm like it's coming guys
with Ja its water lines where stuff and
then put it up because when people do
that so I will say if I'm gonna just
give y'all a grade off the RIP I would
say that this is definitely a 9 out of
10 just because I had to Co wash it and
I'm gonna beat you I was gonna do that
anyway because I plan to put color on it
and most of the colors like a door or
conditioning agent so therefore they're
going to condition your hair regardless
of what you do but it is very smooth
like and you can see in the color oh my
god I'm just a bass and I like the fact
that it's like it's not typical to what
I was gonna do I was gonna put some
orange in here but I feel like that was
gonna be like unicorny like that joke
just was mm-hmm so I've been out to do
to orange because I just feel like all
of these colors had a cohesion to them
that did make sense I wanted to put more
of the lighter colors at the top and the
bottom and then concentrate more of the
aquamarine ish here at the bottom so I
will have to say that I really do enjoy
this hair like Maggie's okay and my hair
is always cute and actually no Maggie
well you known each other for a couple
of years at this point and I'm proud of
her I'm so happy that she did this and
one thing let me just say this too she
is not just an e-commerce brand she's
actually a brand that you can go into in
New York and she has a storefront where
you can go in and touch the hair and
feel the hair and and you know ask
people about what's your best option
sometimes when you guys watch reviews
for us for me my best option may not be
a best option depending on what you're
trying to do sometimes the communication
is definitely start because it's one of
me and a whole bunch of y'all but you
can go to the store I will put the
address here at the bottom if you want
to go and look around and ask questions
and all that if you're in the New York
tri-state area whatever Jersey whatever
make sure you got going
like Maggie I would put all information
below and I love that because today is
much cheaper and easier to actually have
a incomers brand where you just simply
go and you go to my site and you buy it
and you just hope for the best
this actually gives you the opportunity
which I'm very happy that she did you
can go in the store you can see if it
works for you can see if you like it you
can see you can touch you know touch it
feel it make sure all your bundles feel
the same make sure that this texture is
what you exactly want where you're not
guesstimating much looking at a photo
that's what I love about this so yes
hair like Maggie definitely gets a 9 out
of 10 for me and would have been perfect
across the board if I didn't have to do
that but again I have to take points off
for certain things but overall I would
totally wholeheartedly suggest this and
I would suggested too because that way
again if you're in that area you can go
touch the hair that is very important
you know so make sure you guys go
support Maggie Maggie I love you I
notice took forever but girl I couldn't
be able to get snaggletooth looking like
a Beverly hillbilly girl but yes yes I
wanna do next I wanna kind of do this
and Bob form though like I don't think
I'll be able to get all these colors in
a bob but you know I'm saying yeah and
this hair takes colors so well all of
these colors literally look like what
the bottles look like so I'll put a
detailed list of all the colors below as
well as all my bundles again hair like
Maggie and I will catch you guys in my
next one Hey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
