forever which is the company I am
currently a raw Kane it was really cold
today and I don't feel like checking
down my wigs no we decided to you know
French it up today and it worked very
well so this is the hair that I reviewed
from them don't recall when it was but
it's hard enough pretty good I haven't
had any issues as of yet pretty much the
same and as you can see I wear this like
one little pop of color so I had a
meeting today so they liked it so it
learned as far as y'all on social media
like I know Beauty forever it's not the
biggest company but I did work with them
I have a video you know clearly working
with them and I'm getting every time
they post this video is like me and a
whole bunch of other youtubers that have
worked with them it's like a collage
video everybody like oh they're stealing
your stuff you're still in your stuff
and I'm like no they're not I actually
worked for the company and if you would
have went to my page and seen the photo
or the video that they're using is clear
as day and I get that people want to
help don't get me wrong I'm not
unappreciative of people but before you
come just do a little research you know
that's why my page is never like not
down it's always up cuz you have to
whenever you think something might
object scroll to my videos like
everything is there so yeah I have work
with beauty forever before anyway so
they're having a Halloween giveaway for
you guys and I want to give you guys the
rules and then once I give you guys the
rule oh not the rules but I give you
guys the information of like what the
prizes are then I'll give you what you
have to do which is really pretty simple
so we're gonna go through prizes the
first prize winner will get a 22 to 20s
and an 18 inch closure the second prize
winner will get three 18s and a 16 inch
closure and the third winner will get to
16
14 in a 14-inch closure now sometimes
that I do find that these companies use
closure and frontal interchangeable so I
don't know if this is gonna be really a
frontal or is it gonna be a closure now
that's still to be determined because it
says closure here so you're looking for
a frontal you might have to buy down
with yourself stop to the rules of what
you have to do okay you have to be
subscribe to their channel and all the
information of the rules that you have
to do would just be below so everything
is gonna be a click away
so you say you go ahead and you
subscribe to their YouTube channel you
have to follow them on Instagram so -
you have to just follow them on
Instagram which I'll post below but it's
IG Beauty forever and then you have to
like them on Facebook as well and then
for you have to choose your favorite
hair stuff and then comment below like
this I like option this and the hair
type and then the link and then your
email and then please so pretty much
make sure that you guys write all of
your info in that in the comments of
what they're asking you to do so because
this didn't specify where you were
supposed to do it I'm assuming you're
gonna do it on this video so below just
make sure that you follow them on
Instagram you subscribe to them on
YouTube you've liked them on facebook
and below this video let them know what
you what option of hair that you like so
there's a whole bunch of links there are
six links so click on those links and
tell them which option you like and then
put your information which they're
requiring your email address and the
hair type and please leave your contact
info just in case you win so also I'm
just gonna say for this put your
Instagram to just because I think it's
gonna just be easier I don't know who
did this but it wasn't the clearest
which I don't because there's a language
barrier I like like sometimes in China
they don't understand that you're doing
like ten more things that is it would
make it so much easier you know but this
is a pretty good deal because it's you
could use a link for $4 coupon which is
beautiful
17:09 if you do choose to actually
purchase something but yeah you're
getting three bundles and a closure for
free so I found a jar I would actually
decide to go ahead
see what this do - I'm lucky opener -
but uh yeah
and it won't hurt or whatever you can
you know definitely so just put below
like what type of hair that you like
what style you like I don't remember the
exact specs of the hair that I'm
currently wearing but it will be linked
the video that I did for this will be
linked below so you can watch that as
well and the link to that will be in
there - which I'm sure it's part of
these one through six options so if you
guys are interested check out Beauty
forever and again guys if you see me on
their site I actually wore their hair so
they're not doing they're not stealing
my stuff but I love y'all though I love
ya so I hope you guys enjoyed this and I
will catch you guys in my next one cuz I
gotta go do quasi talk huh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
