the basket I'll meet you down beneath
the ground control my purse well attach
the ground like a seat remember my name
cuz you're gonna see me Oliver
so and I'm like a day late the dollar
show but I have fun so this is my Joker
/ Harlequin inspired look Harley would
obviously be the silhouette and then a
joker would be the green in my hair and
the damage tattoo so this hair that I'm
rocking is from halo lady hair and this
hair is their deep loose wave now this
is not the original state of this hair
you know you put flexi rods in your hair
like your straight hair and then you use
like the medium sized one so didn't have
this wave that's in them that's what it
looked like when I received the hair I
went ahead I had this hair for seven
months
just mind you so when I went ahead and
constructed this wig the wig was just a
a frontal and I believe my frontal is 20
inches and I believe I'm rocking two
bundles of I believe it's 22 inches and
two bundles of 24 inch if I'm not
mistaken I don't remember legit what my
lengths are but judging from this
because if I pull is it cut so maybe
it's like maybe either 422 or 220 mm
twenty-fourths I cut this hair too so
again it's been quite some time since
I've had this hair so I don't have any
of the original box or any of that and
this came in when I construct the leg I
did it as just a basic wig nothing
really any different then after having
it for about I think I did this like
right right after I seen Suicide Squad
if I'm not mistaken I don't recall my
whole goal was not to be I did not want
to be hardly playing for Halloween that
was not what I was trying to do because
I knew it was gonna be a hot-ass mess
and everybody was gonna run free with it
so I did this because I wanted to do for
Halloween a more wearable Harley Quinn
look so if you guys sing the movie then
you guys know when they all get their
stuff back that they're known for like
she gets her mallet back in her Jester
Costume she has lower pigtails and she
has the two pieces just in the front I
wanted to go ahead and do that look
verse
the tip you know the the signature look
that you guys seeing all the pronouns
just because everybody has done it's
nothing a little different I wanted to
do this because I knew for a fact if I
would you know if you want to do this
look I could go outside like this and
you would notice that my hair was two
different colors but I don't think you
were too much minded of course this is
the crimson red that I have on this side
and this is more like the I use
aquamarine on this side so yeah it's
kind of washed out a little bit since
I've had it cuz it's been in here hard
and done um yeah I just used that
because I wanted it to be more of a ring
than a blue because I wanted it to look
I wanted to do what was gonna do a look
that was Carly and the Joker together
but it was going to be a wearable of
obviously wearable does not mean put
damaged across your forehead or you know
the extra ish on the side or even this
but if you take that away and you just
so we can just do this if you do this
then yeah I can in the red lipstick it
could work you know and you have I just
cut this on the hers was tattered and
they had it sewn up and now I don't got
the time or the strength for that but I
just wanted more a wearable look now to
the hair the hair yeah this hair I will
say off top did not take color the best
it did not take color very well um and I
noticed as soon as I put the color on it
it is it wasn't going to keep this
natural state of what it was
I used a thirty developer on all the
hair and I did it all at one time
now the crimson red is a color that
actually came so this crimson red in
this box which is the Harlequin crimson
red box that came from splat hair now
what I did not not paying attention
people make sure you guys learn how to
read before you buy stuff I thought this
color came with two colors and it came
with one and I was like okay I'll just
do like I was going to do some of the
blue at the bottom
and I was going to bring it top then I
opened it and realize there's crimson US
obsession that means one color home so
therefore I didn't give wasn't wasn't
too smart with this but the color
actually paid off very well it came with
bleach in it but I didn't use that
bleach I just used the bleach that I'm
used to because I didn't want one side
of my hair to be darker and once because
it was gonna be two super colors so I
didn't want it to be like once I was
darker than any other side was like I
didn't want that so what I did was I
just went ahead and used the aquamarine
like I said on this side that I had and
then obviously if I had a middle part
that this part would be on this side and
then this would be just my red so as you
can see it is two separate colors colors
this is cute
and then I just went ahead and parted it
on the side so that this color would
fall on this side so you see more of
this because I have on all this red now
once I bleach the hair the hair got
really really really really brittle on
me okay it did and I was really mad
because I was blow-drying it and I was
like are serious then I put the color on
top of it and then once I rinsed it
everything felt tsuki again so I've
experienced it a few times when
reviewing hair like it'll be in a moment
where everything feels like it's just
downhill from there I'm like okay
they're gonna hate me now because I'm
about to tell them like desert looked
but after I bleached it then it you know
it came back so as you can see is silky
it does everything that is supposed to
do um I didn't too much care for the
color like that I got cuz the color that
I I was trying to achieve was a little
bit lighter than what I got but I didn't
want it to be overpowered cuz I'm like I
can leave at least as if if it's too
light I can just go ahead and dull it
down but if it's not light enough then
I'm kind of just stuff but I do like
what I ended up getting because it does
give me more of a wearable look which
was my point in the first place was just
a wearable look that I can wear any time
this would be really cute if I took the
pigtails out and then I was
to just part it in one section and then
you know let it all fall because you
have these two colors this hair has no
layers in it except for this little bang
piece in the front that's bothering the
hell out of me other than this I didn't
cut any layers or anything into it just
because I didn't feel like it was
necessary and in the movie her hair was
all one lens um I'm sure whatever wig
that they used on her they was redoing
her pigtails quite often because his
hair does I mean the color runs a lot
when it's um like this in it this
happens with a lot of my other colour my
blue um it bleeds but it doesn't bleed
like it got shot it don't bleed like
that it just bleeds then let's see the
West I really really enjoyed the West
because when I did this I did notice
that I like what's that are really small
like and when I say small I like when
they're like really like that but they
got a lot of hair on them I don't like
when my lips are too like tall because
it feels like you stacking them it just
seems like it starts to get heavy but
when they're really thin like that it's
easier to lay this here so that it can
lay as flat as I would want it to be now
I often not to do the high pigtails like
I told you once before in the beginning
for a reason but also because this isn't
a 360 so if I trying to pull it up in a
ponytail on my arm kitchen gonna be on
the bag and we're not doing it
so halo lady hair I'm gonna get y'all
like a six and a half just because I
like the construction of your webs I
just didn't like the way that the hair
bleach I didn't like that it got dry
after I did it
miraculously a door and splat in crimson
oh were my friends but I do like this
look you know I definitely do like this
look well I try it again probably
because I will be able to get like more
of an even color like I wanted to but
because in the movie Harley's look is
not put together at all it's a mess so
it worked you know it looks I can be in
the movie just like this you know give
me a mallet and ah Oh so if you guys are
interested in this look of any swords
thumbs up this video if you guys love
Suicide Squad which actually comes out
on DVD on Thursday I'll be guinea Koza
the movie waste
be um then yeah and I will catch you
guys in my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
