people but I'm getting over this little
ugly cold that I caught in this past
week so I just wanted to come you guys
because it is December 31st 2014 this is
my last video of the year and I just
wanted to come you guys and kind of give
like some words of encouragement and
some thank yous to you guys for just
sticking with me man I mean to this year
was a monumental year form of animals
well okay um I got my hundred thousand
of subscriber plaque and I'm only said
200 subscribers now which is crazy I
guess that first little hump you know
y'all just dare buddy flock in keep
flocking um but no besides that though I
got to meet a lot of you guys in person
this time I did not get to do a
meet-and-greet this year like I said I
was gonna do last year but that was only
because of it was just so much going on
but I'm not gonna promise next year but
I'm gonna try my damndest in my hardest
for sure to do so but besides that um I
just want to come you guys and say like
a lot of you guys have hit me up and
asked me about like how do I feel about
like the way I've grown since I've
started doing YouTube and stuff like
that and i would say that I feel much
better in which confident as a person um
because of me being myself and doing
this for so long and sometimes there are
things in life because I know this year
for sure for me there are a lot of
things that definitely took me out of my
element and out of my character like
yesterday but you know things happen but
nobody's perfect we all have to learn
from our mistakes and as long as you
don't continue to keep making the same
mistakes then you're going to grow as an
individual just remember that whatever
you want to do with yourself in life you
have to apply yourself 135,000 percent
to whatever you're doing if you only
apply half of it you're going to get a
half-assed product if you only apply
half of you know the the passionate you
for something else then it's not going
to really work out to be something that
you really enjoy so remember in a new
year if you guys are making resolutions
I don't make those because I never keep
them so it's really no point for me to
do so um play for you
we're going to start New York New Year's
resolutions and kind of stick to them
and not do the things that you did this
year next year it stick to those because
what is it going to allow you to do as a
person is grow and like I always said
growth is the biggest thing as humans
that we want we grow from little
children's into other adults and we
don't want to start making teenage
decisions while we're growing as people
it's just not cool so um if there's
somebody telling you that you shouldn't
do this and you shouldn't do that and
you shouldn't be this person and they
don't feel comfortable because of how
you live your life or that's not
practical in the field that you want to
go in all that do what you want to
do you know I'm saying it and be happy
as long as you're not hurting nobody and
as long as you're trying to be a bigger
and better person for you at the end of
the day you know family is what it is
and it's great and everything and it's
great to have a support system but a
support system is not supposed to put
you down yeah I give tough love to my
friends too and I told them the truth
that they're trying to do something that
doesn't necessarily seem like it's going
to be um they're gonna stick with you
know when you know somebody you know
they they're gonna be with this for
about 10 minutes and then it's going to
be over so you you know if it's like
that you know still give them some time
some type of words of encouragement to
want to keep doing it but always be
honest and be honest with yourself stop
trying to be people that you're not stop
trying to stunt on Instagram stop trying
to be someone that is not you like
hardcore you beautiful you are these
 want to talk about you and
talk about you and then when I call
you this and they call you that you're
doing something right because listen I
can't be a hot topic without an audience
remember that okay and what you do is
you swing your mom there and be
like and I did that mm-hmm and you
watching bitch make sure you just be
confident in what you do as well don't
do something and then feel ashamed about
it after you do it because it didn't
makes it seem like it's not authentic
when you really don't give a about
what people think about you and the
things that you do in life and the
things that you want to do any
 could say anything but I'm
still that bitch at the end of the day I
still feel good about myself it seems to
be that you are my deal with the problem
so maybe you should you know stop trying
to tell me why you don't like me and
figure out why you don't like me you
know so
I'll be back next year I was without
some hair reviews up for white label
hair as well as diamond Eric company and
I have not done notes because i have
been sick so those will be an RPG show
12 and i would give away for a wig what
this so um remember um look out for
those as well but yeah I want to
apologize to those companies in advance
I did not know it's going to get sick
but yeah I'm not gonna stop rambling now
you guys have a beautiful posterous with
a beautiful safe um new year and um
bring it in with love no hate don't be
on Instagram fighting about who said
what when it's going to be a new year
this is a point for us to all start out
fresh you know um yes you did you did in
the past ain't gonna be raised it you
can't delete it like a tweet but you can
start off for yourself and I
everybody else but for yourself you can
be better and want to move forward and
do the things that you do what I want
you guys nothing but the best and happy
new year and I'll see y'all next year
cuz a bitch like me is going to differ
