booze eggs and this luscious hair from
her hair company you guys know that I
did a renewal review and I did like uh
kind of like an unboxing when I first
received his hair so I'm back to give
you my final thoughts on this hair I've
had this hair for some time now I've
washed it I tended to color it and it's
still kicking like this is all here
before by the way so you guys know
before I did the review for our company
I had heard about them because a lot of
my fellow youtubers have review for them
or brought their hair or whatever and I
know some of you my subscribers
subscribers have when I put the initial
review if you guys like I love this
company on Instagram y'all were going
crazy like this is some of my favorite
hair and yes this hair I absolutely love
like it's I call this my hat wig as you
can see I would have put on a different
shirt but I can't find the shirt that I
was gonna put on so you know this is
gonna have a suffice for now however
this hair yah is still in such a good
shape after look after I've colored in
and everything it's still kickin it's
still acting right it hasn't mattered on
me or started shedding really bad or my
West or not you know falling apart or
anything look this and this is after
several washes with this hair when I
went to go recolor it it still gave me
that fresh cuz hair is different when
you first get it and then after a while
of wearing it and then coloring it and
then putting heat on it the texture
begins to start to shift and change a
little bit and even though it's you know
that's usually a sign of just kind of
wear of the hair this hair flat-ironed
like it was fresh it might have
something to do with what I'm washing
you know I'm shampooing it with still
fresh you know and what I love is that
the company has hit me up periodically
like how is the hair doing you know how
are you having any issues are you having
any problems like you know any of
which I much appreciate because most
companies that I do review for I get
sent to here I do the review and then
until there's like me doing another of
you I usually don't hear from them so
you know that's a sign of a good
customer service which comes with
anything that you purchase you want to
feel I mean I wish Apple did that you
know you buy an iPad make all you six
months later like hey is your iPad still
kicking but you know everybody is not
fair company so you know we don't have
to deal however yeah I know I said that
I was gonna put a little color at the
bottom I was asking y'all like what
should I put any color in it you know
what should it be
but I decided not to because I feel like
the bangs is enough so to add some color
to it it was gonna start to get real
ratchet and ghetto and that's not the
look that I was going for I was going
for more of a sleeker feel I didn't want
that who would feel you know not for
this you all know I have my hood waist
but not for this um but yeah overall
everything is still acting right so I
can't really say anything more but I am
thoroughly impressed with this hair yeah
I hope you guys enjoyed this and if
you're interested make sure you guys

this hair below and I will see you guys
in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
