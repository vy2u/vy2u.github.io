guess you could save my full review on
my hair which is from her hair company
and you guys know that I came to you
guys with like an initial review on this
hair and how I felt about it which was
all good thing so it's been about I
think I'm gonna say like two weeks since
I made this wig I think it's been about
two weeks since I made this wig and I've
been wearing these bangs I haven't been
wearing them as often as I would like
because it's been a little hot in LA so
yeah and those who are gonna ask my hat
matches my shoes you just can't see them
so don't worry about it okay as I'm sure
you guys noticed in the beginning of
this video you guys seen what it looks
like with no head um and also that you
guys see that I did this with a still
based closure here in the front this
fringe um and I like it I like it a lot
you guys know I did say when I did a
different review that I have never I had
never had bangs before and somebody did
correct me because that was a lie I did
have bangs I had gray bangs that was the
first and only time I've ever had bangs
on this channel
I've had other wigs that I've received
that were supposed to be been equal
another wig and I ended up making into
about but anyway um to this hair so you
guys know that I said that I was gonna
die this hair blue-black and all the
precautions to go forward were taken and
it did not turn out to be blue blood it
just made it like gel black um so yeah
it was the not the hair but it was a
girl that Sally he's talking on some all
of you used this developer than this and
I told her that it wasn't gonna work and
she lied and said it was and clearly it
did not um
but aside from that um it didn't make
the hair a little more lustrous I feel
um it has a lot of movement to it which
you know it's always a good thing I
don't think I would ever curl this
particular style like I've seen people
with straight bangs because these bangs
are definitely straight they just got a
part on the side but this hair is it was
it was very free-flowing when I first
received it and then I put the color on
it and then I went ahead and cut it and
it came out cute I feel like a little
geisha or something though so I really
do like this the hair was very easy to
put in as far as the West go the West
were very well made they were very
tightly round but not too tight where
they don't want to like bend or press
because you notice you know when you get
to the top of your weave or the top of
your wig and then you start to like sink
well I do single the tracks sometimes
they still too thick at the top where
you got it like really sew it down but
it actually didn't give me any problems
far as the closure went on the closure
matches in my opinion very well you can
use seamless in my opinion okay you
can't see the difference the density of
this hair it seems like it feels like I
got in like eight models when I only
really have in the dirt or where all my
bundles came in so this was a 28 25 or
26 I can't tell a 28 a 26 and a 24 oh I
got 22 from maybe that other one was a
22 I don't recall but it all flow very
nicely initially I remember the
conversation that I had with the owner
yeah let me know that he they were gonna
send me an extra bundle just for
fullness which I'm actually very happy
that they did because now everything
flows like he's supposed to us nice and
thick and yeah it was very easy actually
to colored his hair they didn't get you
know sometimes I mean the color that I
used was only a deposit only color I'm
gonna show you what color I used to so I
use this color which is this aged aged
beautiful anti-asian color so this color
is made for people with gray hair um
that one to like died over there gray
hair are they're getting right here
whatever these usually since I work very
well on virgin hair because it takes
very easily
however I've used this color before cuz
I am did like my friends hair she had
like a I think it was like a copper
color and we used this color and it was
great but for whatever reason blue black
is very hard to get as a color but I've
half the color before I just
what I used and this was a permanent
liquid cream that I used and I used blue
black and I use another company that was
called darkest blue and that one was way
bluer it was like it was way bluer than
blue black plus I was gonna do like two
bundles one color and in two bottles
another color so that when I did do this
you can see the difference this hair is
nothing but black it did not change my
hair color at all and I kept it on for
the extended amount of time that was
recommended and then some but it didn't
change the color I used the right volume
and everything and it just did not work
out so yeah unfortunately my blue-black
project was a fail but it's cold oh um
because my hair is still fly you guys
know I'm a big fan of black hair I've
been I love black hair no matter what it
is but I thought a little spunk would
have been cool um but yeah she didn't
know what she was talking about and I'm
good they said if you ain't satisfy you
gonna get your money back I'm gonna get
my money back but aside from that this
hair I've been wearing for literally
every time I will go out in one of these
hats I will pop this on because see I
don't have to worry about the front of
my hair um bitch it's been a little bit
happy because I do have a convertible it
does help you know that I got to worry
about the bangs flying to win and that's
all this hair has been Co watched since
I've had it it was what was washed first
once I colored it I had to rinse the
color out then I co wash it again last
night and then I flat ironed it indeed
all this last night as well so it's been
holding up very well this is after to
sulfate washes and it's been about two
weeks everything blends great the bangs
to me blend perfectly with the hair um
how do you guys feel about the bangs do
you guys like film because I do I just
feel a lot like my mom but yeah I do
like this this is very different it's
Prezi for somebody like me who always
has like a middle part or side part this
is something I always wanted to try
something a little bit different I'm not
scared of bangs um they just always seem
to come off looking a little crazy do
this is what I don't like them when they
look like this
when they start looking like very
blow-up doll ish and you can't see or
you all look like I'm in a hair magazine
this is what I usually don't like them
very much
they ain't very even either if you ain't
noticed um because I told y'all
bangs ain't my strong suit I really
don't like to cut them and I don't like
them like that but to me it's easier to
wear them like this because they look a
little more natural and they ain't all
up in my face cuz if you cut them
shorter what tends to happen with them
is they go everywhere and they just
become this big thing and yeah
but I know a lot of my friends say when
they have bangs they get like them one
they start to sweat - they get them bang
bumps up under and that's not attractive
at all so I didn't wanna I'm asked a
good thing about wigs and beautiful
luscious hair like such is that what you
can do with it is you could take it off
I will say cuz I used it was a deposit
only so I used only a ten value you know
peroxide but I don't know what will
happen if I lift this hair you know cuz
I got one more review which is my final
review to let you guys know how I really
feel about this hair and so far so good
but maybe I should do like an ombre -
like here and maybe I should make it
like gray just at the bottom or make it
like a warm copper color just to see
because you know the bottoms of the hair
is the most porous so it's gonna take
really quick and it's gonna be like a
release in four ombre so I think I'm
gonna put like a color from probably
about here down just to kind of see how
this hair deals with color because so
far what I've done ain't nothing because
the color didn't take so it pisses me
off it feels like I didn't do anything
and I sit here with all them fumes whoo
Lord oh that's not like the color
because it just is it's a very dangerous
and treacherous situation but I know our
pretty girl Angie she just died down
here gray like remember I'm under here
was she is the same color like the ice
gray color and she used it I think the
same hair or I know it's from her hair
company I know that much it took the
color very very well but I want to try
it I may do just great at the tips just
to kind of give it a little pizzazz but
it looks so great jet-black like this
because that's what the color did I mean
just take it from a natural black to a
jet black because there's not virgin
anymore but this is her heir companies a
virgin whoa used to be virgin brazilian
straight hair and uh you guys let me
know how do you guys feel about the
bangs and do you guys like the lustre in
this hair I didn't put Jack nothing in
his hair this is what it after i
conditioned it this is what it looks
like and I you still using my organics
the the water shampoo that and I use to
clarify it I use my GM Giovanni's of tea
tree as well
so yeah I'll be back with my final
review on this yard and let me know
should I or should I not color the
bottoms and on burrito lets me know oh
okay alright</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
