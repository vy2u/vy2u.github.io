review for my hair which is her hair
company and um you guys know that if you
guys do know but as a recently driving
get to my hair I went to a photo shoot
for her their company and had a great
time I wanna start off by saying thank
you to Eric and oil for being so great
Eric's mom is amazing um everybody in
the company was just great like it's I
don't a lot of times especially
reviewing hair you don't really get to
meet people behind it and it's great to
see people who are living their dreams
and providing quality product um to
people and doing great things so I want
to say thank you and I got to meet a
president IV before but I got to meet
fabulosity is me um Morgan so we all got
to work together
it was super duper fun had an amazing
time and can't wait to do it again but
anyway to my hair so since we last spoke
and my actual review I have Co washed
his hair again and I put a little bit of
pearl sermon just like just a smidgen
not a lot but it's mentioned and it
didn't really need it I just wanted to
put it in just to kind of see what it it
did and it just looks like this so this
is what it still looks like I did
straighten a piece and I did I washed it
while I wet it and then I washed it I
went back to this now I don't know again
a person who wears a lot of his hair um
wavy and curly I'm still not an advocate
for straightening it and
a lot because no matter how great it is
it doesn't always stay like that you can
definitely burn the curl pattern out of
hair if you do it weights walking so I
would watch that but it did it
definitely didn't go back this is all of
it it's so easy and it still is so flowy
it is so like natural and you know it's
awful it - the best videos see all of
what it looks like and all of my bundles
that I have it as well as my closure
length will be listed below if it isn't
below its above but I can run my fingers
through it look in your steal eggs in it
looks very natural it blends um if you
pressure hair I'm sure you can get this
to blend with whatever hair you have I
don't think it's going to take a rocket
Ines - unless you have like really
coarse hair then I would definitely uh
give yourself like a nice hard press
just to be on the safe side so that it
will definitely blend and and do I look
like till tee-time
alright so deep below pumpkin but I'm
like who do I look like with this hair
these earrings in his jacket in this
tipsy time so I love her so I'm gonna
say it before anybody else says it
didn't really plan on it but you know on
the info for this jacket definitely
would be oh yeah this is well this is
what I call loving some hair long tear
yawning - been winter on the world with
this Mo's on what you plan and it's just
so effortless I feel like I could get
away with this
if you see me like walking down the
street like okay hair popping nothing
yeah make sure you guys check the links
below for our hair company um can't take
any other great things about the company
the hair this is overall this has been a
great experience for me because lately
I've been getting a lot of hair I'm
facin back and you know it's just not a
quality it's not great it doesn't do
this it's not flowy I can't do this with
you know like look at look how easy that
is
and I braided this hair down and
everything else is still hot hmm
I did I opted for no color I know I
asked you guys about all that Java :
didn't ever do it
oh it's just because I didn't want to
mess up the pattern and I do like it
black and I can't really see this hair
in any other color honestly but black I
would like to and maybe in the near
future I will but as of right now I just
don't know cuz I really do enjoy it and
I really do like it so you guys and like
it and enjoy it
um definitely check the links below and
I will check y'all and talk to y'all
later
