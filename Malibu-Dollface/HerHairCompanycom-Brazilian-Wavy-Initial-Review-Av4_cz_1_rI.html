review for my new her hair company hair
and it is nothing here that I'm wearing
um this is I believe so do not call me
but it will be in the title I believe
this is their Brazilian wavy hair and I
have five bundles and a 14 inch lace
closure but always you get a blissful
form of hair extensions which is a care
card and explains your extensions to the
tee of what you would not to do not too
much clothing what shampoos you should
dry use if you should air dry before you
install it tells you about do not
massage the cuticle rinse thoroughly
with warm water apply conditioner comb
through of what alcohol-based products
to avoid drying out your investment and
always till your webs
I have not sealed my lips and I don't
know how long it just really depends on
the person but for those who have
constant wear or you are a person who's
gonna saw your leave-in then I
definitely would so I would definitely
say my lips because again like they said
and here is not cheap and if you do not
fill them and they start to share you're
gonna think it's the company but really
it's just kind of a wear and tear of
hair so if I was you I would definitely
read this entire card and it's signed on
the back so I pretty much to let you
know that it has its quality control it
also comes with a phone number as well
as an email if you have any questions
about your hair
so all of my brothers came and deep
plastic bags and they all have her hair
company on the front like such and each
bundle is in a bag like this and then
each length is on the top corner so this
one is a 22 I have a 24 I have a plain
and I have a 14 inch lace closure my
closure looks like and this closure kind
of have more of a body weight to it were
versus the way that this is but if you
do pull this apart then
you should be big fine it'll blend right
right because when you disturb by the
way the ends up becoming like a more
above or normal way jingling so this is
what the hair looks like just in its
natural state
it has nothing has never been Co watched
hasn't been touched since I received it
and anyway this is what it looks like
and it has a nice pretty weight to it
I'm almost certain I know how this hair
is gonna turn out one shot actually
install it it's gonna have more of a
natural look to it but it's not gonna be
so I had did a picture Lauren I did a
review on a actual wig wig this is gonna
be made into a wig but it's actually a
wig and it was just more of an natural
look to it and they kind of had this
pattern in it but it is very nice it is
very soft it doesn't have any tangles
and I can actually run my fingers
through it and I rig
shoestring no that's actually one folded
so one so let's do the King and I got
nothing time nothing so this should
actually be good
it has the double tie and the thing I
like about her hair company is that you
pull this down
there's no rubberband right here a lot
of companies will put a rubberband right
here which causes the beards to be worse
right here and then it also causes the
hair to have a big dent in it so when
you do sew it down is all your bundles
have this big dent in it what you try to
get out I usually use a flat iron to do
it but they just use this nice it's not
a ponytail holder because once you take
it out it's just going on right boom but
it's great that you don't do this
because rubber bands tend to tear the
hair um especially because it'd be like
three and four to it sometimes I get in
there wrapped around and I just cut them
out so yeah I don't let you guys know
exactly how this turns out you guys
shall see this shortly and I'm thinking
about actually probably pretty lifting
this the color of this hair um but I'm
gonna wear it in its natural state for a
little bit before I put any color on it
because I do kind of look you want to
bleach it um
and then I'll Flatiron it and just like
a test to show you guys if it
water hits it if it actually goes back
does he think that people don't
understand is sometimes when you get
like curly hair or sometimes lady here
wait here is a very loose curly hair of
course should be much tighter than this
but wavy hair is pretty loose so if you
do end up flat ironing and sometimes it
does not go back and you end up with
straight hair that it used to be wavy
that's why you guys know I used to flat
iron my curly hair and some of my lady
here and I stopped doing that because it
loosens the curl pattern so after a
while all that heat it eventually just
goes away and then there's nothing left
and then you just have a loose wave
weave that you have to wear straight
because it looked stupid kinda sorta
wavy it just looks off so again this is
from her hair company this is their
Brazilian body wave nor is the Brazilian
wave and it's in two twenty fours 220
220 and a 14-inch closure so you guys
stay tuned for this and I will</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
