guys so I'm worried
so this hair is giving me like Janet
Jackson if vibes you know um
so this hair is from her hair company
don't mind my box it ripped and then I
took it everywhere um but I'm gonna give
you guys all the specs about this hair
plus I didn't even use it all so before
we even get into it this is what I have
left this weft and I have this left and
I'm sure if I tried I could squeeze this
in well because my hair was already so
full I was like I'm good I'm fine I
don't have to put it in there but I'm
probably gonna try to squeeze it up in
here you know um so you guys know I did
my initial review this is for her hair
company of course um this hair is one of
the easiest in ourselves I think I've
ever done because it's so free-flowing
and it kind of gives me this very just
it's very just kind of get up and go
like all right I must to go I'm just
gonna throw my wig it's kind of how my
remember when I have the curly hair and
it was like very Rick James's that's
kind of the kind of the same thing
because when you have here that is so
effortless like this and I go wash this
hair three four times so I'll Co washes
hair for time since I've had it because
I've been wearing it of course on and
off you guys know me if you guys will
see me
within a week like in person like the
lady at Whole Foods she like your hair's
always just so different I'm like
giggles I'm Justin out here to see if I
like it or not but this you can't get no
better than this because it's so low
maintenance like you can do no wrong
with this that's why I'm just like oh I
love this this is much I don't have to
have a part it's very free-flowing
I can just throw it anywhere the the
wave is not so defined where you know
sometimes when you have curly hair or
sometimes with here um sometimes it's
it's more defined in some areas and in
other areas is not so different I don't
really like when my hair does that so
I'll go back and trim like okay I'll
curl this one I got to curl this to try
to make it
look like it's all one um and of course
real here it's not like that I know a
lot of my friends who have hair like
this just naturally and they were like
my hair patterns don't never match like
my real hair patterns they don't never
match sometimes because I spray my hair
more in the front it kind of gets more
wavy and in the back is more curly it
just really depends on the person in the
texture of hair but I have in to 24 to
20s you know to 24 is to 22 and 120 and
then I think my closure to match which
is lace is a 14 inch closure um and it
gives me like this bang piece here in
the front
but yes guys I I will say this I've
never had an issue with her hair company
ever okay ever and as of lately I've
been having a lot of issues with other
companies but never hire company they've
always been respectful they've always
been nicely always to me great hair and
everybody that I don't know who has
purchased their hair loves it even
before I started reviewing people like I
guess some of my best hair ever so they
pay attention to quality when it comes
down to it quality is what hair should
be and when you don't have quality hair
it shows you know it's a lot of times
this would not have lasted four whole
options if this was um some other type
of hair you know are from a different
company not every company because I've
had hair that's been very similar to
this but I've put this hair in a bun i
braided it down i've unbraided it and it
still goes back to this and as you guys
can tell my hair texture still matches
this heritage like if I do this and this
here hasn't been co-wash or anything
this is you know what it looked like
when I first put it in it still matches
to the tee nothing's changed and a lot
of times once you wash hair call I
should put color in it or whatever it
changes like nobody's business
now you guys know I have this thing
where I'm really really really really
wanting my hair to be like a ginger red
like Amber's from clueless like I really
want that so I'm thinking about doing it
on this hair so I can be like a very
wavy scene here's here's my dilemma
hair that's this beautiful it looks so
effortless when it's black sometimes
when you put color and hair for me
personally I just on him I just don't
like how it looks it starts to look a
little ratchet when you put a little
ratchet red on it or any color for that
matter it's just like nothing is better
than that good ol black y'all know how I
feel about my black hair so I don't know
what do you guys feel like should I just
keep it like this
and have these nice you know virus
swimsuit y'all poppin so oh yeah I've
had this hair for a little bit of time
but I've been wearing it a whole lot of
time I didn't put any products in it
none at all this is just natural this is
what it looks like um after I let it air
dry I do not however I will not never
blow-dry my curly or wavy hair I always
let it air dry into the natural state
that it is just like a lot of times when
people buy curly hair and then you wash
it and you be like oh it doesn't really
look like how when I first got it if you
wring it out and then let it dry upside
down all of the nice pretty curls will
come back but if you start going through
with heat the heat relaxes the curl and
or the waves and it kind of ruins the
hair so if you don't have any extra time
then just wait because I would ruin my
hair because this is some beautiful hair
y'all it is so beautiful and it's so
soft and manageable but even though I
have in five bundles it's very Airy so
it gives me the fullness that I want but
it doesn't give me the bulk that I don't
need and a lot of times I see a lot of
people with a lot of bulk in their weave
especially here during around the top
you can't tell that you know there's a
separation here usually when you see
people's weaves as Brazilian tree it's a
lot up here and that's why I like to
make the bottoms really full and then
make the top just what it is because
that's how real natural hair is you do
not want your weave to look unnatural
that is a waste of money um so yeah it's
beautiful pan
this is right here and it's just so so
natural you know I feel so natural um
that's what it's giving me like I just
have this natural beautiful hair yeah
you know but yeah this is definitely her
hair company this you can tell you can
tell the quality oh it's amazing so you
guys are interested in this hair make
sure you guys click the link below and
then I'm going to come back for my final
review afterwards and I'm attempt to put
a little bit of color in it but I'm so I
just don't want to ruin it and then I
want to you know like make it black
again so we will see but if you have any
suggestions what it would be and please
y'all know purple
I don't like purple and I don't really
want purple but maybe just this kind of
stick to the red family so maybe a
little bit of color at the end that's
like a burgundy um maybe a really plum
no something like that but please y'all
know purple um no great no nothing that
I would have to strip I want something
that I can deposit the color but it's
still gonna keep you know I don't wanna
have to bleach this hair in any way
shape or form I'm gonna keep it just
like it is nice soft and beautiful so
let me know what you guys think let me
get a close-up of as it said Oh texture
yeah baby and again I have no type of
product in his hair whatsoever this is
just how it came and then I just let it
air dry after the words that I've had
song let me know what you guys think and
I'll talk to you guys a little bit I've
never been so caught up but now I was
brought up
oh no for too long</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
