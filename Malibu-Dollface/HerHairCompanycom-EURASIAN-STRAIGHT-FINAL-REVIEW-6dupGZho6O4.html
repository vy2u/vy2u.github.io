messing up fellas so this is gonna be my
final review for my nice elections a
bombshell miss that is my blonde
platinum hair from her hair company so
the last time I got I seen you guys with
his hair if you do not follow me on
instagram would have been when I met mr.
Jeremy Scott so I went to a mosquito
event that I was invited to and Jeremy
was there totally recognized me which
something that just it just made my life
um and I decided to wear all of my
Barbie mosquito stuff and of course if I
want to be Barbie I have to be blond so
I decided to opt in wear this hair which
I and you guys noticed in the picture in
here my part is usually over here but I
switched it for that event on this side
so a you know um but I will get to the
hair and how its held up for me thus far
the way slash curls that you see right
now are the same curls that were in
there a month ago
you know like this is the same which
I've seen last time I just literally put
it on and brush it out and and go but so
far literally so good I have never had
an issue with any of my hair company
hair and I will not start with this this
hair is still is beautiful it was from
the day that I received it and overall
her company I feel like is one of those
companies especially a us-based company
that you can't go wrong with because
they do give you nice quality hair and
you guys I did the review me the review
I did the initial Photoshop for this so
many months ago and the fact that my
hair is still is luscious and as
beautiful as it is I want to know who
their render is because um this hair is
gorgeous a lot of times after a while of
wearing blonde hair I've noticed that my
would start to get a little on the
darker side or the brassy brown side I
start becoming a bit of a dirty blonde
as opposed to being a platinum blonde so
um that's kind of the thing that I'm
noticing about this hair is that it's
not doing what I'm so used to so that's
why after a certain amount of time
usually when I do have a blonde hair I
tend to just go ahead and color it
because it'll you know I can just a
color I'll be good now you guys know
initially when I reviewed this I was
itching to put color in it and a lot of
you guys suggested that you guys like
the color that it is and being that this
is some of the first blonde hair I've
ever had where I did not have to fix the
color or color the hair or anything I'm
going to keep it this color because it's
going to be my signature blonde wig if
you will um but yeah if you guys are
interested in some 6:13 here even if
you're going to color the hair I would
suggest them um a lot of times today
especially today when you do look for
our companies who actually carry this
6:13 hair the problem is it doesn't come
as long and the problem usually is it
doesn't come as light sometimes it's
more of a honey blondish color or it may
be a honey blonde with accents of this
color but it's never all this color and
it states this color the only thing that
I do when I wash it that's a little bit
different from my other hair is I do not
wash it with a purple shampoo because my
hair would be lavender right now what I
actually do is I use a neutralizing
shampoo that you would use for like a
relaxer or a perm and you use the
neutralizer shampoo I use that because I
find that that actually clarifies the
hair but it will not dry it out and I
won't leave anything but you can use the
white shampoo you know I'm saying any
shampoo that is I'm not clear but it has
is white it will actually help your hair
I'll be this cuz they actually have
shampoo that's made for blonde hair
specifically which I do own I don't tend
to like it because I don't feel like it
clarifies the hair enough since why I
use
neutralizing shampoo because I just feel
like my hair is not a fully clean and as
much product as I put in my hair because
I do like to have heavy products when
I'm trying to keep a style like such
even though it's doing stacks stupid
here in the front
I'd like to use a lot of product only so
my hair will stay in place and usually
I'm taking a lot of pictures I'm in
front of lights so it tends to work with
me everyday I wouldn't use nearly as
many products in my hair is I would
during a work like review or whatever
you could do a lot with this I wanted to
put some color just here at the bottom
but then I feel like it wouldn't even if
it was pink because you guys know I'm
never dumped in here before but it's
something I spent heavy on my mind just
singing I just feel like it will kind of
take the class out of the sass that is
the bargain here I feel like it kind of
ghettos it up a little bit so I don't
want that to be the situation by a long
shot
other than that no issues no problem so
great a for me to you or to her err
company because I feel like her hair
company is one of those very few
companies still offer great quality hair
without kind of sacrificing price for
quality or quality for price I thought
like they give you everything in one
which is a good thing because a lot of
times fine here today oh yeah I should
see what I go through and how much here
I send back because it's so bad but did
never have these issues here from our
away me here to my Oh straight hair to
this never had an issue so if you guys
are interested please visit her hair
company down below if you do get this
hair please hit me up let me know how
you styled it and how you know you did
the whole damn thing and I will catch
you guys in my next one if I seem a
little somber I'm going to say that in
this video is because I just got my
wisdom tooth pulled and my face is still
kind of swollen so I really don't feel
that great so pray for me people and
I'll guy I will catch you guys in my
next one okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
