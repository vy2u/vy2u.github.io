unboxing / like first impressions video
for her um her hair company is an
company that I know a lot of you guys
have brought from your letter you guys
love a lot of my fellow youtubers have
also worked with them before so it's
matching so I'm gonna take you guys I'm
gonna open the box
cuz I haven't done it this far and I'm
gonna say you you know how I feel about
the hair and all that good stuff
so let's get started so this is the
packaging this is just pretty much me
open it up but I will say I love their
packaging how they put it in the box
instead of a bag okay so here is a this
is like a haircare instructions
maintenance instructions and so I've won
already the one thing I love about this
is that a lot of you guys will spend a
lot of money on here and say I need some
some really good quality hair but then
you don't know how to take care of the
hair so this is actually very perfect
thanks Noel um they signed at the bottom
to let you know that it is quality
controlled and hey I've checked the hair
and all of that good stuff and somebody
is not like they just say here you go
here you go here you go they sent it out
like somebody actually took time to like
do this so so far so good I haven't you
seen here so yeah okay so these are
Wicca bundles come in like this and then
they have the number at the top of what
a length it is so this is a 28 a 28 and
it also says our hair company on the
plastic as well and then this one is a
24 and this one is a 26 so this is five
bundles of hair um so what I'm currently
rocking right now is five bundles so my
hair would be as full as his hair is
right here um I love the fact that
they're individually
but I also like the fact that each
individual rap has these little black
things around it I tend to get the
silver ones which they I don't know what
it is about those but they tend to snag
the hair so we're gonna take this think
this others are 28 and okay we're gonna
see examined our bundles shall we okay
so this is what they look like his hair
is really soft but it's like buttery
this reminds me of my mink hair when I
took it out the bag it was like this so
it moves it shakes the lustre is the
same as the hair I having right now
which is great because it lets me know
that it's gonna it's gonna be into my
needs um let's see this is what the West
look like and the beards are not bad at
all so yeah they're doublelift they're
very flat which I love because a lot of
times who lord y'all know ain't nothing
worse than a thick bundle because
putting it in is gonna be hell and
sometimes you are forced to wear your
hair curly or wavy because it won't lay
flat because the bundles are so thick so
yeah I like this I like this hair is
good this is I can tell by the length
and by the texture of the hair but this
hair will be good really like an aside a
deep side part bone straight this would
be everything but also curling it to
would be an up side as well so I'm
actually excited about this it's gonna
be a beautiful install so I'm actually
very excited for this so again this hair
right now is from her hair company I am
going to start making the wake for this
tonight and probably within like the
next week you guys should see like my
first official review review on that
hair to see how I like it so you guys I
want you guys to put below what kind of
style would you guys like for to see me
do with that hair cuz I have so many
like what haven't I done yeah maybe some
wand curls
I'm also gonna color this hair this is
the hair that I'm gonna call her
blue-black cuz I didn't get to do it for
the other hair that I wanted so this
hair is gonna be color blue black and
then I'm going to install it so let me
know what you guys but what are your
thoughts I'm gonna do what I want to do
anyway but I still want some ideas let
me kind of know what you guys feel would
be good for this because this hair is
very very very nice and I'm sure it'll
take great to color but I just don't
want it to be the same colors just here
you know like I got enough off brown
hair so I did tell them that I was gonna
color they said go for it so blue black
is gonna be the color but what style so
put this down below that you guys think
I should do with this and then when I
come back let's see who won so I'll see
you guys in the next one and that will
be my first like my first first review
but so far so good the hair looks very
very nice it looks very constructive
very well and it's very soft so we shall
see I will catch on and the next one
