right guys so we're trying new stuff um
just getting over a bit of a cold
Ricola is if we kicking it right now so
to my her okay this is the Peruvian
straight from hob duty hair at three
bundles of twenty four inch
however I believe if I'm not mistaken
that my frontal is 20 inches no I think
it's 22 inches lord please are cut it
anyways but so this video is about their
C shaped photos that come already or
Italy come already pre pluck like such
so my frontal came just like this
already plug into the part so what
they're doing now a lot of people I've
seen but you guys asked me in the past
like wouldn't you prefer a free um what
is it a free style frontal or closure or
do you like the ones with like the three
partners and always tell you guys I like
to personally go with the free parts
because I can kind of do it any way that
I want to hence I don't think you guys
somebody probably noticed now but my
hair is parted on this side and you guys
knows where my part on this side so that
was very different for me too because
I've done this before
um I'm just so not used to doing it on a
different size but I didn't really have
much of a choice in this matter because
when I got the front so it was already
parted on this side um and just a side
note I did not plug nor that I bleach
the knots on this frontal this frontal
is straight out of the box and just like
that so let me get a close-up at your
house so as you can see so as you can
see you still can see my knots because I
did not bleach them what I did wear what
I hadn't did was um I probably put some
video of this somewhere in here but what
I did was I just curled his hair with
like literally I did it in like ten
minutes
and I you guys follow me on snapchat but
you should which is Evelyn Malibu
Dollface I nicknamed this lady Angela
Kardashian Angela C Kardashian I wig
because blac chyna when she was in a
belief paper magazine or whatever
magazine she on the cover of right now
we're just like a behind her her hair
her frontal is is pretty much like this
yeah a little more valium right here but
that's because I literally had this
heroine all day and I'm happy my hair
didn't last it so that's just some of
the things right um as far as the actual
hair goals aside from the frontal um no
issues no problems as you guys can see
it definitely is lustrous and beautiful
Desa shine was definitely added because
you guys know let's use my beyond the
zone um are he protecting which actually
works as a shine as well so the luster
this here was definitely not dis much
like this shiny but it definitely made a
difference in the hair and how it looked
and how actually worried because because
look because this look is definitely
like an old Hollywood big waves you
definitely want a lot of shine in your
hair you want your hair to look
expensive and you know like it's been
baking for the last six months
which you want your hair to look
expensive and like it's been baking and
waiting for you to take this out for the
last six months it's just so luxurious
so that this actually goes I wouldn't go
for such a high shine on hair that I
will be wearing every day and because
it's on camera and everything is on HD
it definitely looks like it's shinier
than what it actually is
but again three bundles is all I'm
rocking which I love because a lot of
know a lot of you guys like for me to do
the more believable bundles and I feel
like this is more of a believable look
um and it is very easy to do the only
thing that I did was cut some layers in
it and I used my frontal as a guideline
to actually see where I wanted my layers
and stuff to actually be but I love this
see part situation now there are pros
and cons to it so we're going to kind of
visit those right now so we're going to
go with the cons the cons are because
all of this hair was plucked out even
when you wash it it's still gonna be
bald right there like it's going to be
all of this space right here uh the
other thing is that if you try to change
the placement of your part such as let's
say on the middle part and then I have a
middle part even when I go ahead and lay
everything down how I want that see is
still going to be there it may not it
may be in a different direction
all this hair will be part of this way
but it's still gonna be there so the
wind blow or something like that just
depending on how you wear your hair like
let's just say this see was on Lord was
on this side then if our wind blew like
this then you probably will be able to
see that there was a sea there you know
um another downside
another content is is the fact that you
cannot customize how you want your part
to necessarily be now I don't know if
they offer this to you guys but I'm
saying where is it that you can like
customize it to what you want because my
part would not have been like this it
would have been more it would be bigger
it would have been would've been a
capital C house of that um and this is
more like a lowercase C again this is
more so in my opinion for people who are
not good at parting like I've seen a lot
of people have like great installs but
whoever parted their hair it wasn't
clean it didn't look like your hair was
finished it looked like you just kind of
parted it so that you can section off
some other sections um now the pros of
this the pros are you don't have to do
nothing when you get it
besides bleach it and plug it if you
wanted to but because I'm seeing that up
like I said before and I always say a
lot of these companies are realizing
that the less density they put in their
frontals especially in the front the
less work they have to do in the less
work you have to do so that's the good
part about that um the other upside
about this is the fact that if you are a
person who wears your hair in the same
style all the time you can guarantee
that when the wind blows is gonna be in
that style because you can part this
just like this and then put another part
and I promise you if the wind blow is
gonna go right back into the C shape so
if you are a person um that is you're
used to structure you don't really like
to change much this also will be very
ugly for you if you another good thing
is if you're a person like me who wears
a lot of wigs I have links for different
reasons so this would be my glam wig you
know and I like the fact that the part
is on the opposite side even though I'm
not used to it it's not like my other
wigs one is easier to find to like okay
is on this side but also it's because of
the simple fact that I'm able to
actually
I'm who I'm able to actually kind of
switch it on and off and don't it can
sometimes I will say this when I have
wore my hair on the opposite side it did
took me take me a while to kind of get
the gist of wearing it on the opposite
side and then trying to figure out where
the placement of my part would be with
this you really don't have much of a
choice so it kind of sits where it is
and it depends on how far over you put
your frontal because mine are ear to
hear so that means that the side is here
if I would not put the ear tabs where
they go on my actual frontal then I
could have put this part all the way
over here Ravel like it you know so
that's kind of the upside of it it's
less work and I think this is a smart
move for them it's less work I've seen
this done a lot of times where I've
gotten wigs like for instance my RPG
show wigs for instance you guys know
real quick yes princess you guys know
over with a lot of wig companies and I
told you guys in like a couple of rules
reviews back where I said a lot of the
competition the way companies now are
starting to put the parts in there for
us a lot of those parts are plucked out
so it's like a permanent part and again
if you're a creature of habit
this is great for you and for me I love
the fact that um especially everybody
stop light so that's what I love about
it now here's one hang-up that i must
address there's a big problem if you are
a person who only wears your hair on one
side so this would be my right side so
if i was a person who only go right here
on my left side i will be kind of right
now because i would be very
uncomfortable trying to make this work i
don't know if they give you the option
to do a left or a right part i think a
hug here you guys should implement that
or give options to buy one or the other
because everybody doesn't necessarily
wear their hair on one side but i think
the idea is great it is very smart
because
it does do is it gives the consumer more
of an option and they can kind of see
and what is the biggest thing that I
love about this entire situation is the
fact that my frontal when it came it
came flat so it had a little bit of an
Ibis body in it here in the front
well it's a little more because the girl
did but it had the body in it but it
wasn't that you know you get frontals
and everything
it's plucked backwards so it's clipped
from here here no it actually was the
curve of the seam and then everything
else around it was flat and then where
you would actually put the actual part
or whatever you would do with this
whether you curled it are you wore as
straight had a little bit of lifted but
it wasn't that thick crazy mess that
you're so used to when you get front
tools especially now people are going
crazy an enemy like baby here crazy I
had a little bit of baby here on the
side which I actually use because I
thought was very it like it was plucked
to perfection so if you guys are
interested in these tresses again I have
the Peruvian strengths I believe I have
in 324 s and I believe in my frontal was
a 22 inch all the links for this will be
below I know some of y'all gonna ask me
I'll put the link for this jacket below
too so I'll catch you guys in my next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
