green behind me that means I was lazy
about taking out the background so if I
say anything about the background taking
something out just ignore it feels like
I'm gonna be like I'm in my confessional
for love and hip-hop that's what I feel
like Debbie had the nerve to come to me
and save me she don't even know me like
that but now so to Alette tresses it
feels really good to kind of like be
back you guys know I take my breaks and
this was a longer break than I
anticipated
but I actually did the reviews for this
hair like three weeks ago and the way my
hair line was looking in that video
which I also like a clip or a picture
here so if you follow me on snapchat
that you know you know I had this one
and I did a video whatever I just didn't
like it so I took it out redid it
reflected reapplied it and girl baby
snack so sometimes I have to go back to
the drawing board because in person it
looks a certain way but on camera it
looks completely different so yeah so
this hair is from hot Beauty hair and
I'm gonna I want to say that this is a
wig but I mean it is a wig but it's like
it's it's like a lace front wig but it's
a 360 so my band goes all the way around
my head but the try there are tracks
that they put in the middle and know for
those who are asking it did not come
this color okay
so I'll get to that in a second but I
want to give you guys the specs on this
first and then we can go to the coloring
process and what I did searching this
look so I have a loose wave 360 front
too and I have loose wave bundles that I
went ahead and straightened and I will
say that after I bleached it it did
keeps keep its original form like it
didn't get like very straight on me
although it wasn't as loose wave ish as
it was when I first received it so think
about that cuz you guys know how
chemicals are and if which I'm I'm
almost 99.9% sure that his hair was yeah
of course treated to be a little wave
than that what the bleach was not gonna
keep it in this original statement like
when you receive it but it's not gonna
be nothing crazy loose wave can be
achieved with just
but some waves in it and ring your
fingers to it I mean there's nothing
deep now as far as my bundles is
concerned I don't know how many was in
the wig there are quite a few tracks
back here and I'm gonna say this off the
rips I did not enjoy the way that
whoever sold the tracks to this wig I
didn't like the way that they did it and
the reason why I didn't like it is
because right here on the thigh I had to
like super put a whole bunch of
hairspray
and a whole bunch of guys to be glued in
order to not be in because it was like a
split right here and then you was able
to actually see the West which is a
no-no so that was one thing I didn't
like about this and then they because
they sell them to sell them separately
but the thing is there is a you know you
get like a regular 360 frontal so it's a
hole in it you just have to put over
your head well this actually has a cap
already attached to it so you guys know
when I get like the spanning caps and
then our sodas you don't have to do that
part you just have to slow the actual
tracks or glue the tracks on and then
there you go
so that's what I have it does have an
adjustable strap here in the back which
I am I'm loving because that's what's
keeping my wig on because I got like
it's like my real hair like tucked up
under you as far as the shedding goes
before we get to that I'm explaining the
color and what I used to achieve this
color so this wig was an original it was
this color the color of my jacket and I
was over it I was like I'm really like
if you guys notice like my reviews have
slowed down because I'm still like like
I said before my testing process is a
little bit longer than usual but on top
of that just get a little bored so a lot
of hair starting to have a lot of color
to it some of it I'll leave it like it
is but for the most part if I want to
have some fun I'm throwing some color in
it and then the summer's almost over on
top of that and then on top of all of
that
my little sister wanted a blonde wig so
I was like okay I'm gonna go ahead and
make you one and she wanted this very
Allah this is very well as you can see
from my Beyonce Destiny's Child and TV I
was in her homegirls intro
it was very Destiny's Child old school
Beyonce this bleach which I absolutely
adore so that bleach is actually a it's
great for the hair like yeah I've had no
issues with it I actually use that now
to do all my coloring I don't use me
you believe I don't use Collider colors
or any of that anymore I use that bleach
to actually color my hair and bleach my
are my actual not as well because that
is so thick it doesn't bleed through
like the BW never make it like you have
to make it a specific consistency with
that because it's already thick I just
put some 40 mix it up make sure it looks
like toothpaste
boom-boom-boom 25 minutes rinse perfect
no bleeding through no nothing so if
you're just looking for something you
have like a specific bleach you like but
you need something for your not that's
not working and it doesn't give you that
brassy look God thank you so as you can
see use that so what I did was I did
these probably wherever my roots are
from here down and then I went and went
again I like after a couple of days you
know I put some protein on the hair and
all that just to make sure that my hair
wouldn't fall apart because again this
is my hair that I put in here the actual
hair the wig came like this so I was
like you can't mess it up did you mess
it up you've got to hit the company up
and they gonna be like so what you gonna
do so I was like okay so I went ahead
and did that and then I went back and
put some highlights in it which of these
lighter pieces here but I did it
concentrated it only really here in the
front area and then I went back and did
the base color of it which seems very
backwards but I'm a very backwards
person to get all of these tones so
that's why there's a couple of different
tones that are going on in my hair
because again this is specifically for
my sister so she's lighter than me so
she wanted her roots to be dark and she
wanted it to go into a very blondish
color so yeah it actually turned out
very great so to the shaking part I
received very minimal shedding and
usually when you bleach hair more than
once it ends up being where it wants to
shave really really bad because a hair
gets dried and it wants to you know come
apart but as you can see this is still
very very very nice but if you still
hate me whatever and on top of that it's
full enough for her I'm a person who
would have probably even if it was me
and I actually made this week just
trying out about
another bundle in it probably just
because I'm just that extra and I like
my hair that's full but because she's
not that type of a person I was happy
with this because this is the the
average look for the working person she
works a regular job so she can't just be
out and it's been like a hundred and
fifty five million degrees here so
therefore I haven't been wearing a lot
of my thick hair for that reason I wore
my 613 here at night girl and I felt
like a hole in the scroll because it was
so hot so yeah come as far as the lace
was concerned I don't know if this lace
came with a specific cuz I don't have
the card anymore because it's been so
damn long boy I could've swore I got
like a light brown lace the lace just
seemed like it was much darker after I
went ahead and cut it and put it so I
don't know what it was because it just
seems like I was having a very hard time
concealing my lace with this particular
unit originally and I'm like maybe it's
because you can see and maybe I got
makeup in it I didn't know now I'm able
to you know get through it and be
alright but it took off I took a while
and I don't know what that was I did I
usually I'm like specify I want light
brown legs but from now on I'm gonna
actually ask for transparent lace
because that actually seems to work much
better for me because I noticed that
when I do like 613 here or even when I
see 13 wigs it's easier to conceal that
lace than it is for like when you bleach
your nuts because it changes the color
so transparent I'm with that all day
okay
transparent works so for as far as this
wig is concerned there are a couple of
things about it that I'm not super super
excited about which was I told you guys
which was the track issue of me park
near right here because I did part it
very far over so I wanted to be able to
have that option because you guys know I
had when people part the hair and then
be like right here that's not a side
part that is an off center missile part
that was one thing that it kind of
irritated me the other thing that I
didn't really like about this hair was
the fact that it wasn't full that's the
you know it wasn't full um I could have
put some tracks in here because there is
space in the back I could have put
tracks but I wasn't married to the idea
and again
this isn't for me so I was like I'm
gonna try to see if I could be okay with
just this much but I was a thing it's
like you should they should give you
options to have fuller you know wigs and
then non full of wigs you know the
density you should be able to pick even
though there's tracks in the back you
should be able to pick your density
because you're buying it like this but
for the average person like I said this
definitely so this is what it looks like
all ports to the front so this is how
thick and this is how full it actually
is and again like I said I really like
it because I curl any and I cut layers
into it and you guys know after you cut
layers into some hair girl run for cover
because when you curl it it might look
like a nice little stained mess but it's
actually not it's really nice I did
however have to put quite a lot of
hairspray due to the simple fact that my
hair was not as full in order for it to
stay because it didn't want to go limp
if I have to give it a 1 to 10 I will
give it us an 8 because I didn't like
the way that the tracks are and the
tracks on this unit they were not bleach
herbal meaning because they sold the
track down when I went over them with
bleach they didn't it was because
they're so tight on there they didn't
want to necessarily bleach so I had I
really if I wanted this obviously 13
that wasn't what happened because even
at the roots of that my roots would have
been real weird here in the back now as
far as the whoever showed it to the
track they sold it so tight that if I
don't pull this week all the way down
then I'm gonna get that buckling effect
which I don't really like that was my
one gripe with this that's why I put all
this hair spray on the inside because
you will be right here is a track you
will be able to tell there's a track
right there so in person no you can't
tell look like I just smooth them spank
out of my hair but I know that there's a
track there and if the wind was to blow
all the hairspray and I got
big blue spray that I put it ain't going
nowhere but if I went in my hair to be a
little bit on a softer side at the top
that would have been a bit of a problem
so for those who work on a new to this
just I look me personally I think they
retail for the same price I would just
buy a cap by the the 360 band then buy
the actual hair and didn't do it myself
as opposed to letting him do it because
if you let them do it you're gonna gonna
be stuck with it and you got to work
around it versus what you can do so if
