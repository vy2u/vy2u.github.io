hair that I'm currently wearing and some
of you will probably not believe me when
I say this but this hair is from
Aliexpress okay um this is from a
company called hot Beauty this is a the
box that all the hair came in I have in
for twenty fours and a Subway's closure
from closure store and this is actually
my silk based closure that I use for my
34 inch hair dye was like really long
I use this closure for that so I'm
repurposing it because I'm redoing all
my units with new new caps so I decided
let me go ahead and use this since they
only had Lacey you guys know how I feel
about these closures I just really don't
like them um but we'll get to the specs
of this hair actually um this hair I've
been rocking it's one of those units
that I've been rocking as part of those
five that I've been interchanging and I
cannot tell you guys the last time I
actually had a middle part with curls it
will waves it's been ages since I've
done this style and I really did miss it
like well I love this um it frames my
face very well cuz I cut my um my layers
to frame my prima facie so I'm feeling
very Kardashian esque
today um but to the bundles they were
the bundles because they're all 24 so
some of the bundles were that my third
bundle the first issue that I had was
the fact that it tangled on me and I
don't know if it's because how I'm
wrapped it or whatever but I had to
brush it through but since then I
haven't had such you know such issues
another thing that I did notice is that
the beards on his hair was quite there
like some bubbles had none and then
other bundles had quite a few so the
third and the fourth bundle had a lot of
beards but the first in the second
bundle didn't have many if any at all so
I don't know why that was any different
when I did receive the hair they had
these little cards which I'm sure you
guys seen in the beginning of where the
photo let it have each car which i think
is great that tells you what bundle is
which which was great because it was all
24 so it's kind of like okay um I
shampoo this hair well I shampooed it
once and I Co washed it three times the
reason I did it so many times is because
I wanted to see how the hair was gonna
act once I wet it and I tried three
different shampoos on it I tried my
organics purple wine on the the Moroccan
art yeah that one and then the coconut
milk and it took two all of those very
very very well on a hold to curl which
is great about this like as you can see
this big curl right here it holds
I just reeked Earl just the top part my
closure apart as far as my layers are
concerned what I did was um when I sewed
the closure on again I just let the hair
fall naturally where it's gonna fall and
then I just cut I just take pretty much
I take the hair like such cuz I don't
wanna mess it up I want to take the hair
like I said and I just cut back and then
I keep pushing it this way to see if
it's gonna fall how it's gonna fall and
then when I go and curl it I just curl
it away from my face and then ends up
doing this um
once I'm done and my hair's been like
that it is now eight eight forty-five so
my hair has been like this since nine
o'clock this morning so the only thing
that I redid was this top part because
it really does like the fall and I did
in my hair and haven't really redone in
much sense so yeah so I'm really what
I'm really giving right now is really
like Lauren London that's what I'm
feeling maybe no okay so yeah um but
yeah I love this hair so far what I will
say is that those bundles I mean this is
a realistic four bundles this is not you
know my
you know I like five bundles in a
closure of the front so not like that
crazy you know it's still very realistic
it hasn't given me any tangling up I
wouldn't personally color this hair
because I like the color that it is but
I wouldn't lift it or anything cuz this
is like one of the units like when I
make these units I make them
specifically for reason so if I want the
middle part with some curls I'll pull
this one out if I want a straight one
I'll go get you know my favorite middle
part wig if I want a side part I'll go
that's why I wear so much hair because
everyone serves a different purpose so
this is their Brazilian hair and they
say that this hair has not been treated
at at any point its chemical free
it's unprocessed so from what I'm
feeling and what I've smelled and what
I've experienced because you know hair
is different when you get it wet you
know it turns into a whole different
beast but when I did wet it it didn't
give me any funny smells or anything
like that it still definitely stayed
away it still stayed straight it says
that it's unprocessed and there's
nothing in the hair which I personally
believe because if it was usually when
you start to like mesh chemicals like
sulfate shampoo with whatever they put
in their hair it gets is a real bad
Friedel smell and you like hear
something's up in here that do not agree
with this at all so I can vouch it's
wherever me as far as my concern that
hasn't had anything harmful in it it may
very well be virgin hair I think they're
doing a good job let me just let me just
preface it saying let me just say this
this is some really nice hair like for
the price it is very nice like this is
up here with some of my very expensive
virgin hair so shout out to y'all
because y'all did a good job with this
this is some good good good hair it does
have a very very natural feel to it umm
it does have a very realistic natural
moment to it it's not really like fall
sometimes like with certain hair that I
wear I mean you know it's we've you know
Zen but it looks nice it flows nice but
this has a very natural feel to it like
you see like the luster is very natural
it doesn't have any
extra than it it don't feel like it's
just too much it just feels like okay
you curled your hair today it's pretty
you know that's like that's what it
gives you so they also say that they're
each bundle is from one head and if
anybody knows you like with virgin hair
the cuticles if they're all in one
direction the hair won't tangle but if
the bundles are from me and your summer
front plate if one bundle has like half
of my hair and in half of her hair then
our cuticles are not in the same
direction meaning that's what causes the
hair to tangle a lot this hair detangle
that third bundle that had some beards
it tangled on me however the other three
did not but um so far I haven't had any
matting or you know if I get back here
usually is where you start getting the
most and I haven't had any like in the
back where it starts to Madden and want
to get stupid so I will believe what
they say as far as that concern um I do
like the fact that they let you know
that our hair comes from what each
bundle comes from a specific donor it's
not seven people in one bundle and you
trying to figure out why this hair has
so many grays and so many beards and why
it's so sparse you know and then this
part is so thick so I think I like the
fact that they let you know so it
doesn't me feel good to know like okay
so they did do their homework like it is
I feel like they telling the truth
you know I'm the web that all the hair
is on its double wefted so it says no
shedding but I did experience I'm just a
little bit not nothing crazy but you
know definitely now I'm not getting yeah
I'm not getting any now but you know
when you put in here it you gotta it's
like a trial run you got to see what
works and what does and if it's gonna
act up if it's not but yeah as far as
shedding goes especially when you get
hair wet unless you know like really
what it's about because it starts to
shed like a mangy dog when that water
hit it
so this hair has not given me any of
that those problems so I will say that
they good in that book they say it's
very full and soft I will agree with one
it is very soft but it's not very full I
don't I mmm three ounces I don't really
know
I will kind of say maybe sorta but the
kind of not really um only because of
what I'm used to so it could just be I'm
biased because of the simple fact that
I'm used to wearing like eight bundles
so for especially in 24 inches is it's
longer so the wefts are not as long
meaning they're not as full as maybe
you're 12 um this hair can be dyed and
it can be styled any way that you wanted
this is a style that I personally went
for because um I have not had the style
in ages so I wanted to go back to
something that I really missed so I'm
probably gonna wear my hair like this on
my birthday so hi beauty you guys get an
a-plus for me for this good old hair
because um this is very affordable but
look how great I made this hair look and
it don't cost a fraction of what some of
my other hair does so if you guys are
interested make sure you guys check the
links below I'll definitely be wearing
this oh good old puppy out cuz I do miss
this hairstyle but I probably would do
this same style with just longer hair or
probably just more bundles uh but yeah
let me know what you guys think and I
will catch you guys in the next I got a
close-up on my closure so a lot of y'all
always ask me are you the close up on
your closure so here you go this is my
closure is right yeah it stops right
there and then arrested this is the
sub-base of the closure system so you
can see a little bit of lace right here
because I leave that on for a little bit
but this is what the actual silk base
looks like so from a distance vine scalp
I'll catch you guys do the next quit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
