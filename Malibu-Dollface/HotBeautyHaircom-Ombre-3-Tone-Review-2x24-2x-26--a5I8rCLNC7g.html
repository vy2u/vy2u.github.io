right now is actually from the company
hot Duty here you guys know that I
review for them I think like three
months ago I had the middle part this is
with their hair was the hair that caused
me to go back into like my middle part
obsession so during that time I had did
the middle party you guys know I had the
layers and all of that good stuff
well this time around they sent me this
ombre hair so for those who are trying
to figure out what's going on cuz it
looked like I really colored this hair
this color which I did me but it looks
like I did and I have a closure that did
not match and I made it really whoa
I think I made a match really good the
hair is a ombre ombre wefted hair so
it's a like a blondish like a dirty
blonde down here it's a brown and then
the top is black my closure is my
closure from closure store and it's just
naturally black so what I did was I just
went ahead and curled it into the hair
cuz if I would have were these straight
it would have been very obvious that it
didn't match but the curls actually
helped blend everything together which I
love this hair is really soft and you
know I'm used to very soft hair but this
hair is like a abnormally soft like I
wish she wasn't so soft and you guys
know how I feel about that and for it to
have been processed like the bottom of
it been processed they did one hell of a
job with keeping the lustre and the arm
and the softness in the hair because you
guys know bleach is not hairs best
friend by a longshot
you know bleach is always that one thing
usually like you know like I gotta
bleach it and it's not gonna be as soft
as like usually what happens to me it
I'll bleach this will be after I bleach
it this will be all nice then I get down
here and it'll still be nice but it
won't
as nice appear as far as the texture
goes you just you know it just strips
the hair of its natural oils and all of
that but I don't know what they did and
I would like to find out because they
did a really really great job and I
remember seeing this on their Instagram
page like that is some really nice hair
sometimes you see hair in a photo and
then it looks one way and then you get
it and then it look totally different
but they did a good job with this like
look how beautiful this is at the bottom
and you guys know I'm not a big fan of
the whole um I've never been like a big
fan of the ombre hair so last year you
guys know I have had a similar style it
was just you know my favorite side part
and it was like this but when I
originally had got that hair it was
black and then I had got some dye and I
did it like this I don't think it was
this bright at the bottom but it was
very similar but my hair was really dry
because I used this hot topics bleach
which I shouldn't have used but because
you know it was buy one get one free I
was like why not and it was like 40 and
yeah but this is the look that I wanted
I'm gonna give you a look a closer look
at how the hair is so you can see how
beautiful it is and it goes from this
lighter color then it goes into this
brown color then it goes into the black
color so everything blends gray like
what yes yes yes yes yes and this would
even be very beautiful straightening
that I would have to do is I have to
make sure that my closure which is this
would have to be colored at least this
color for it to have a gradiation
without me actually putting forth a
little color to this it's hard to wear
straight without it looking wonky and
kind of crazy you know so to the specs
of this hair I am wearing a I wanna
believe is a 16 inch Russian still waist
closure from closures door but my
bundles I have been four so I have in
224 is in 226 it's from my understanding
so my hair is actually Peruvian this is
the well it's not virgin anymore
it was because with the color clearly
it's not
but um these are the tags that came with
it they were all Melinda's came with
this wrapped around it says 100%
Peruvian hair and it says ha beauty hair
around the top and then each one of
these has my bundle length on it so this
one I believe they're just a letter 2040
uh I think it says 24 I think this one
says 26 I think this one is the 24 in
the 26 so like I said I think it was 24
and 26 foot and then this is the amount
of hair that I have left it's just this
track is the only thing that was left
and I could have put it in but I just
didn't feel like it I've made this wig
and have been wearing it off and on
right before I moved I actually move
some of my stuff not a lot of stuff but
I'm selling my stuff in here and the
fact that I'm not living in LA no more
I'm in Sherman Oaks now the heat is
different so when when it gets hot
outside this hair does not revert which
I love my curls do fall
now let's get that straight they don't
last as long as I would like them like
probably within another hour they will
be very very loose however for the fact
that this hair is affordable then I'll
take that I'll take one for the team I
just don't like how soft it is not
because if it was straight it would be a
different story I would be really happy
if they were straight but because I
don't you know I was being lazy with the
closure get down you know it's not
exactly in what I wanted but overall I
do like it overall it's very nice
especially for the price it's very very
nice so if you guys are interested in
this hot Beauty hair make sure you guys
click the links below and I will catch
you in the next one and I found out
before I go I found out they have great
like great purplish hair now like this
like it's ombre but at the bottom it
goes listen I'm gonna need that real bad
but I'll let y'all know in the next one
