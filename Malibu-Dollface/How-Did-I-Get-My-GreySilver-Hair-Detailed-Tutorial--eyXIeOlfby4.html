I do to achieve this color my old lady
color um so yeah I give all props for
this application and for this hair
turning out the way it did to ivy so
I'll put I'm sure a lot of you guys who
watch me just for hair videos you guys
know who he is so yeah um so you can go
ahead and subscribe to her because she
has just did a video about this too but
I'm gonna kind of skim over everything
kind of make it in layman's terms or
whatever so I had text her and axed her
with colored issues or whatever and she
told me that she I used this argan oil
color in 9a okay when I got to Sally's
okay they only had two of these left so
I was like well do you have any more in
the back or whatever and she was like no
and Ivy was telling me like you know
this is the color so when I looked at
the color swatches I think that it was
the 10a
was a little bit and they look the same
I mean it was like a shade off so I was
just like it's like the difference
between magenta in pinky sometimes you
can tell the difference sometimes you
can so I said I've had whatever so I got
both of these the issue is you guys know
when you get are when you use ten
developer you most of the time when you
buy a darker color it has ten developer
in it like if you buy like like a box of
color like this it comes with ten
developer in it but the UM when I
brought for these I got a free one of
these why - I think every two boxes of
these you brought you got a free
developer I really didn't pay much
attention because I grabbed a ten she
told me to get ten volume for this color
because it was going to deposit the
color my button I make paying no
attention and I'm looking at the price
that they telling me it was $57 for all
of the stuff you um what ended up
happening was I got 20 developer so when
I went to go do my hair and in my this
hair was originally blonde it was
platinum blonde when I got it
um I went to go put it on there y'all
this hair was I mean like the it was
expanding like you're not supposed to
put things that have developer in like a
bag or whatever but I really didn't care
because I just wanted to herb and turns
on because I was I was doing a lot
whatever so I put it all in the bag I
didn't close I didn't if it all the way
but it was like expanding it was about
to blow up it was hot so I'm just
oh god so I I did my closure too I did
it all with the same developer the
clothes returned but the hair did not
the hair just got like white like pretty
much it just pretty much turn white um
and so many words I mean it wasn't like
why does the walls but it was like this
but it was white enough so I was like
okay but I was kind of a waste because
you know that was pretty much pointless
okay so then after I was done with that
I rinse the hair out and I put I didn't
shampoo it only rinsed it and then there
are some stuff it's like it's a
temporary hair color and I think I threw
the damn bottle away but the bottle is
out it should be somewhere in this video
like maybe right here whatever but it's
a temporary hair color for old people
will for people Webb gray hair okay so I
took that color and I just splashed it
all like I put it in a ziploc bag and I
left of the the the bundles I let the
little things that they use to keep the
bonus clothes so that's why I still have
like a hint of blonde in here because
those pieces that didn't get the gray on
it ended up just still being blonde when
I was all said and done or whatever so I
kind of like the little hint though it's
cute like as you can see like in the
hair likes it like in here it's still
kind of blond so what I ended up doing
was I put that all on her hair now she
told me to put it in the hair for only I
think five to six hours is what she told
me in a text message I left it on for 25
almost 30 hours okay so that was like a
day and some change that I had left that
I did it like late that night and I
didn't
incident so later the next night so when
what did dick look I posted a picture on
Instagram and as you can see in a
picture on Instagram the oh um it's
probably not even meteor but anyway uh
what ended up happening was around like
the left part you can still see it was
blonde but the more and more I let it
sit and I like saturated like I put the
whole the rest of the whole bottle in
there and then I let it stack pretty
much saturate the color as I let it's a
temporary hair color but if you do leave
it in for a long time it will become
permanent because when I went to go
rinse the hair and was like uh it was
you know color was coming out but you
can tell this color was like it was it
was in there like it wasn't coming out
so then when I was done with that I rent
all the hair like real good until it was
like squeaky and then I used the
shimmering lights shampoo
uh well shimmer lights shampoo we used
to use this in school when used to do
elderly people's hair and that's how I
knew what it was because the color of it
is like a purple color oh good because I
don't want this to come all out so I
just open it but it's like it's like a
purple color you break into but it's
pretty much the same is like this color
so I use this and it's pretty much toned
the hair to give it more of this like
lavender looking hue or whatever so
that's why it kind of looks lavender in
some areas because of this because this
does kind of stain a little bit and then
I use the conditioner as well um after I
was done and I let this sit for probably
three minutes or whatever and then I
rinsed it out once I rinsed it out I let
it air dry I did not blow dry the hair I
let it air dry for probably by like a
day and then once it was done I put it
on a you part and I did the same for my
closure my closure was a little bit
different because it's a soap base
closure so I didn't want the Sun base to
get stained so what I did was I took
another ziplock bag I put some of the
color in the bag I put a rubber band
like I typed the top of a closure like
all the hair was down here and then
close your progress up here I put a
rubber band over it put it in there
closed it put a rubber band over that
and then once I did that everything was
all said and done and then I let that
sit - so it all ended up being the exact
same code as you can't tell where my
closure starts and where it begins so
that was good I'll have this same
grayish silver you know
lavender undertone to it or whatever and
that was pretty much it it's really
simple once you get it um the whole
dyeing process because IV did hers and
hers did turn like a grey color I
believe the point is because it's an ash
color it's going to make the hair this
color so if this starts to fade my
favorite probably back blonde or not as
blonde but it'll be kind of long but
this is pretty I watch this hair like
four times and in this think I'm alone
so yeah leave it in here as long as you
feel necessary if you don't leave it in
for a week do it
the longer you leave it in here the more
it's going to stick to here and I did
put mines I put in a ziploc bag and I
put it in a microwave for like the
temporary hair color not the dye I put
it in a microwave for about too many two
minutes or whatever let it get nice and
you know high and then I put it and you
just let it air dry or whatever I'm kind
of poked a little not will open the
little hole so it kind of air out and I
did it that way so that probably could
have also been a reason to because they
helped the hair on the color stick to
the hair and that's pretty much been it
I haven't had any problems or issues
with it at all quite frankly I'm very
very happy with this so yeah if you
always want to try it
tag me in it on Instagram or Twitter or
here or whatever make a response video
if you want to try to gray hair I like
it it's different
um I don't feel like I look like an old
woman but if you do find cool whatever
if I might dandy I don't care
I live it though and then I just took my
one and a half barrel curling iron and
put these curls in and then combed them
out that's pretty much all it took and I
was good I didn't really have to put
much layers in it at all as you can see
this layer is really stupid because I
curled it the wrong way but it's
supposed to be like that but to keep
doing dirt so yeah oh I feel like storm
from x-men that's
kind of how I feel on with this hair
like I want to go and have some wine
eyes maybe I edit that in here for the I
got my storm here well I'm gonna do my
girl um pretty girl Angie I love her
shirts go like this or can you do it but
you know what I mean no look at this one
