old treats I came doing videos but I
normally don't do them
I am currently was today
oh oh so Evans I am on my way to well
later pride I can see America in another
hour and a half I had meetings for
whiskey girls um I'm about to go to
Chipotle but before I go I wanted to do
a video really quick about two things
one loyalty into this whether we have it
okay um they said that it was supposed
to rain today and when I say rain it was
supposed to a poor raining um yeah it's
sprinkling like I don't know if you
could tell on my back window but it's
sprinkling like it's not you know like
not wet outside but it's not crazy
and then I just seen Easter will post
something that I phone to him saying oh
a flash flood warning god I hope I'm not
here for this but yeah hmm
so yeah off that and I'm mad cuz my hair
is like done and is about to be
like but I do got it what's the name I
took it off my other jacket I just took
it off just in case you know cuz I don't
do one in Perlas cuz they always flip up
and you'd be looking stupid and always
laugh at people who should do that so
I'm just saying though so yeah um now
I'm off let's see praying again and I
don't know what I want from Chipotle doe
I'm all off-topic okay so anyway um yeah
about loyalty like I was just thinking
like when I was getting dressed or
whatever um which ain't much uh today we
just don't um like loyalty I've had so
many friends in the past that were not
loyal to me that would drop me at the
drop of a hat because of someone else
and nine times out of ten that one
person that they dropped me for snow
longer around and get them so up
and it's just like
Wow you know the friends I have now
they're very loyal to me you know so
well broken other people in between and
you guys probably never met and every
while we're friends waiting a chart on
me you know in recent years it's just
like so um yeah I think that loyalty
today is very rare and a lot of you guys
like I see um you guys like on Twitter
and stuff and you guys have been friends
for a long time and then not that bitch
from kindergarten not that bitch but
you've been friends for a nice amount of
time and then you let someone who you
don't know who doesn't even live in the
same state as you come and kind of ruin
your friendship with this person which
sucks because especially if they were a
good friend you know you never let
someone who doesn't matter get in
between someone who does matter that
sucks so I will say to you guys like
when it comes down just being real with
somebody and actually being like being
somebody's friend do it all the way
don't half-ass it or or do it a little
bit like do it for Fallout like if
you're doing choreography like bitch
fool it out you know like do it because
if you don't it's gonna show and it's
gonna really affect your relationship
with your friends yeah I mean and I'm
not just saying loyalty as far as
friends is concerned I'm saying loyalty
as far as family good family um good
friends you know good spouse you know
you have to save somebody tells you
something in confidence then make sure
that you're actually using it in
confidence and you're you're not using
it you never use it against them with
someone tell you something you never use
that what they say against them because
that goes to show that you put that when
I told you that that was something that
you put in your pocket in hopes to use
one day against this person you know
like there are things that people told
me there are things I know about people
that did me wrong and I would never say
back to them although they've said very
disrespectful things about me and to me
um I'm not gonna stoop to your level and
be so boom you know it's like what why I
like what's the point what's the point
of me even going
and why that's my whole thing it's just
why like people who do that you know I
could see not being someone's friends or
not being loyal to someone because they
did something wrong to you that makes
sense I get it but if this person never
did anything wrong to you but be your
friend and always there for you and give
you this and give you that in and cool
and all what's the point and what I
cannot stand and I've seen a lot and
I've experienced a lot is that you'll be
cool with someone and then they'll go
and be cool with someone else and then
they act as if they don't know you you
know it's like what are we in like
elementary school but you can't have
more than one friend like who does that
like I don't know like for me that's
just a bit much and it's a little extra
for me say what you want about me but
I'm just saying um yeah I think that we
can all coexist like when I have groups
of friends I think that is great that we
all get to know each other we all get to
kick it we are you know like all the
segregation and this is my friend is
very high school is really is very
elementary school if you ask me like
this is my friend it's gonna play in the
sandbox with me we're not your friend
today type of situation nobody wants
that Lee understand like nobody needs
that first off it's just why for what
reason so I mean today like I said
loyalty is something that is talked
about preached about but never practiced
and y'all gotta understand that these
people out here especially people that
you meeting on Twitter and you mean on
Facebook and you think that your friends
and they turn around with the next group
of people and they talk
buko about you and don't care and
you're you're you're basically giving a
side I just somebody who's been around
and had your back for years like you
know I'm saying even if it's not years
but they've been a good friend
then you should never a li innate
someone who is a positive force in your
life you know you never want to get rid
of someone who's always helping you and
wanting you to do better with yourself
you don't want that bitter Betty ass
bitch that we talked about also
long ago who doesn't want anything good
for you and soon somebody else come
along with a little more change a little
more Fame you know a little more of this
a little more that then they wanna kick
it with you know them it's not
with you you know so that's why I said
you know make sure you evaluate your
friends correctly cuz sometimes who you
think you are friends with is not who
you're friends with and you can you can
definitely learn the hard way you know
especially in your adult life about
stuff like this I'm just saying though I
ain't saying I'm doing so you know
loyalty needs to be something that's
taken seriously you know like it's so
rare it's like it's like trying to find
a pair of old-school Jordache jeans or
trying to find some la gears like the
old ones that light up like it's
impossible and if you do find it you
know it's just like uh what was you
doing all the way in the back behind
everything with the dust like damn so if
you are a very good friend to someone
and you know and don't be afraid to tell
your friends you love them like that's
what friends I love them all the time
because you never know what's gonna
happen you know me losing someone I was
close to me this this year like a couple
of days after my birthday was it was
really traumatic um you know I had the I
did talk to them and for me always
saying you know I love you and I just
want you to know that I do care about
you and I love you made it easier a
little bit easier for me to see him go
and you know the way he went was very
traumatic but you know is his life and I
think that while you're here make sure
that you give your love attention in
time to people who deserve it not people
who wanted or requested because you know
friendship is not a request that's not
something that you need friends are not
needed you know you don't need friends
to breathe that's something that you
choose to have and it's something that
can be very great in a relationship when
it comes down to friends but make sure
it's the correct people don't let it be
you know the wrong as people because
then you learn and I think at a certain
age you should get to the point where
you should be tired of being burned
my friends you should be tired of being
lied to and disrespected in you know
like you you at one point as a person
should grow tired of doing it you know
so I think at this point is just a
matter of when you're tired you know
when it comes down to it when are you
tired when you over it when you don't
give a no more you know when are
you trying to figure out where the real
people are because there are real there
are people who really are real in this
world and there are a lot of people but
it's Jay do you want to be friends with
them that's the thing do you want that
loyal bitch in your life is that's the
thing it's all on you if that's what you
will it is a dime-a-dozen and they all
around it's just that you have to want
it because if you don't want it and you
don't allow yourself to you know have it
in it be in your presence that you are
never you know gonna experience it with
it cuz my friends are my confidence my
friends are the people that I run to
when something goes wrong and I know for
the fact if I tell them something it's
not gonna be all across America and
everybody's gonna be pointing the finger
at me for II I know for a fact that I
can hold I can give them secrets and
they're loyal enough not to run off and
tell the next bitch like it just doesn't
make any sense to me so with that said
pick your friends wisely and if someone
tells you something in confidence then
you take it in confidence don't be a rat
ass bitch don't be um
stupid and run off and tell something
that you wouldn't want nobody to tell
about you you know or even if you do and
you don't give a
respect them enough to know for a fact
that's not something that they want
people to know you know so it's it's a
respect thing you got a know for a fact
that your friends are the people that
you can lean on because if not I suggest
you keep your mouth shut
cuz I see a lot of on Twitter and
on Facebook or people be going in on
people and bitch you did taste and I
heard you did that and I heard you did
this and it's just like wow and I was
your friend like three weeks ago Wow
so yeah that's all I had to say about
that I just popped in my head as I was
driving so yeah I'll talk to y'all later
yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
