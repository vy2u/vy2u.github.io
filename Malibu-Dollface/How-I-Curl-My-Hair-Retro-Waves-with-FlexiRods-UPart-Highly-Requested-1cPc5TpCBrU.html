beautiful bouncy curls they do
alright so finally I got into this or
whatever but this is going to be a hair
tutorial
Owen though the wave slash curls that
I've been wearing probably in the last I
want to say a couple of months or
whatever that everybody and your I've
never gotten so many like requests for
tutorial as I have for this one which is
crazy so no this is now the suit now I'm
not done I haven't even got started but
um it's gonna be basically on the waves
now um or the curls or whatever just
like the soft bouncy curls that you like
y'all like so much um so I don't want to
do too much rambling but these left over
curls are from Saturday and it's
Wednesday and I just have my hand up on
it and just gonna land on it and I just
combed it out and kind of went over my
leave I was a little bit oh and I kind
of get some people requested like how do
I get my leave out straight so I kind of
go over that but I'm just kind of
booking some products that you're going
to need for this tutorial um the first
thing that you're going to need is a
curling iron and I'm using my Conair
curling iron that has the little buttons
here and this curling iron it was 1999
at Target this is the only one that I
use I think it's a 1 in 1/4 inch iron
you can feel this smokin but this iggy
is hot I think it goes up to 400 degrees
from this pecan here Pro infinity I was
gonna get a 2 inch barrel but I decided
not to because across more so I was like
I'm not about to do that but I'm
actually happy I got this one this is
exactly what I need um the next thing
that you're going to need if you're
going to go over your leave out is
you're just going to need a flat iron of
any kind people actually kind of flutter
on I used this old s flat iron I got
tape on it right here is from when I was
in beauty school and we had got our kids
and my came with the golden hot flat
irons
um I've been using these forever I have
like four other firearms but these are
like my go-to that never do anything but
what the hell I needed to do especially
with my figures here so these are the
only ones that I pretty much use um
you're going to need a paddle brush of
any kind of whatever use a comb you're
going to need two rollers like this if
you don't have two rollers it's okay you
can use a flexi rod but I would prefer
these um you need some edge control
which I've already this is the edge
control that I use for everybody who
keeps asking it is it doesn't flake it
doesn't get um white and all of that
miss um and then you're going to need
two sizes in your flexi rods you're
going to need a like this size they
don't have to be exactly that could be a
little bit smaller a little bit bigger
just depends on what you want and then
these smaller ones so pretty much these
are the two sizes that you're going to
need and you're going to need some clips
so um before I got started and I did my
leave out I did it off camera I use this
is like the holy grail of what I use to
keep my hair nice and shiny and to blend
with my weave I use there's a tumbling
degree right now because I just I went
over a real rough but this is the beyond
the zone turn up the heat um heat
protecting spray it has like a citrusy
orange II smell to it or whatever I love
this stuff to death
I actually got hip to this um when I was
in beauty school because um they would
give it they would sell it in the front
or whatever but you see how easy it just
makes everything flow so this is if you
don't review not really great at
blending I mean you only need a little
bit but if you're not great at blending
this actually this stuff is actually
really really good um another thing that
I wanted to say before we get started is
my hair is cut okay I have in a 22 and
18 know a twenty two or twenty eighteen
and a sixteen so to make that in
layman's terms this is a layer
this is a lair as you can see they're
not the same and then this is a bottom
layer so I have it there hmm how can I
put it it's a little thicker up here
than it is at the bottom I didn't cut
the bottom I only cut it too in the
front to frame my face to go down play
the rest of this actually is and I never
cut the back so it's just the sides and
the front that are layer so whenever you
if you want to get your hair cut just
tell them that you want a 3-tier layer
and they just basically here here and in
the bottom layer or whatever okay so
let's get started what you're going to
do is you're going to purchase your hair
in two sections like such and then
you're going to take one section which
would be whatever section you choose and
you're gonna pin it up now some people
work from back to front I tend to work
from side to side because it seems to be
a little bit easier for me so now what
I'm gonna do on this side is I'm going
to just kind of eyeball it and pick a
section which is about this much of a
section we're going to take all of this
and another big and we're going to take
we're going to brush it out we're going
to take our curling iron make sure that
your stuff is only now what I'm going to
do that most people do not do is I'm
gonna curl everything towards the camera
most people will tell you to cut
everything away from your face I the
reason why I throw everything towards my
face is because I like those big billowy
Kirk curls and I hate that when you do
the wings right here when you do curl it
away from your face
when they fall they fall like this and
then it's just big gap and then it falls
and I find it to be also and rugged and
plus I like that 1940s 1960s 50s look or
whatever and that's pretty much the curl
that we're going for so everything that
I'm gonna curl is I'm gonna curl
everything toward pretty much is gonna
take all your hair and you're gonna curl
everything towards your face um it's
pretty self-explanatory you don't have
to do much just keep curling and make
sure you curl just in three full
sections and over during the curls so
that when you take them out they're
bouncy enough flat
you
nice around
okay now when you put the roller and you
press it like against the curl and then
you roll into your face if you were
going to do it a different way though
you put the roller behind the curl and
then you will roll it away from your
face most people get the directions
mixed up but yeah it's pretty it's not
that hard just remember your directions
because sometimes I will do my hair and
I'll start curling our rolling in a
different direction and then realize
like okay enhancer be curly but as you
can see here I'm curling everything any
word so that when I take it out
everything is in the same direction you
can do like one row and one direction
and then one row in another direction
and it also will give you away but if
definis is it gives you more like a
beachy wave and this is more like a
defined a bigger bouncy way
okay you get to the top here you're
gonna curl still you're going to throw
inward but you're gonna curl it's kind
of over director curling iron a little
high and being rolling so that that
world are kind of sits like an offset
day at your hair now right here what I'm
explaining is um everything pretty much
all your rollers go towards your face
and then we're going to put the bigger
roller in the front and what it does is
it's going to add a lot of value I use
Garnier Fructis --is um humidity spray
because it flexes and when you put a
nice amount of hairspray because you
watching to say it's good to have a
flexible hairspray so pretty much here
I'm just curling it it's comment at its
angle not straight up but kind of edit
angle because it's just going to come
and fall in my face um Amy want this to
be a little more defined so pretty much
this house look we're going to use the
roller because as you know I press in my
hair and when you press it it takes all
the body out so this is basically
sitting the body - aim that we check out
vents before with the present on in the
flat iron and you pretty much just wrap
it around and then you two big duckbill
clips um to UM hold them you can use
bobby pins as well if you choose to and
I do spray I you will see me use a nice
amount of hairspray my hair never gets
crunchy it never gets hard but it does
stay in which their whole purpose of
this is that you want your curls to stay
as long as possible um so yeah as you
can see I'm going to respray and then
I'm gonna praise for like two more times
after this but this usually is just the
first time I do it and then after this I
never have to spray it again I usually
just flexi routed and go to bed
California sunshine and I use the
Flatirons way because instep is actually
really good it protects your hair from
any damage obviously but it actually
really does help because they're shiny
install and actually smell good so I use
a quite a bit of that actually got some
valleys beautiful I hide
um I think was about five here as you
can see I had a little confusion but I'm
just pretty much gonna do the same thing
on this side that I did on the other
side and when you put in your flexi wire
to make sure they're pretty tight um
because these things tend to come out
and they tend to not want to stay some
time so make sure you I mean they're
they flex so you can get it ignorant
with them as you choose - um in order
for your hair to actually stay in place
and those clothes to be defined and not
just a side note you notice that I'm
putting the bigger rollers at the bottom
and the smaller rollers at the top
because I want them a little bit tighter
and more defined at the top than I do
the bottom okay so this is pretty much
what you will be left with there is
people always ask me is it heavy it's
not heavy because there's nothing in the
back basically you're doing the
perimeter of your head around the sides
and as you can see my favorite spray I'm
spraying again and this is just to lock
in and it actually helps pull the growth
down a little bit quicker
um but it locks it in and for some more
a little um be protecting spray and I
let them sit for about an hour when I do
so if you don't want to have to sit for
about an hour an option you can have a
juicer footage dry here or as you can
see here I use my t3 a limited edition
garden below dryer and use the school
shot to actually help it's cool clicker
and as you can see this is the take down
for it and it's pretty self-explanatory
you just take them down try not to
disturb the flexi rods when you do take
them down kind of roll them in the way
that you put them in um and as you can
see as I'm gonna get a little snag here
sometimes because of the little plastic
things your hair gets caught sometimes
and as you can see I was having a very
difficult time taking this one out yet I
didn't ruin the curl so just be a little
bit patient and you'll see in a second
what I mean by adding the value back
California sunshine now you're gonna let
them a point out that that side is
actually tighter than inside and that's
because I did that one first and then
this is 1 so it is very imperative that
you let these curls stay in state if you
wanted to be in phenomenal cars every
time this happened to me because I've
been in a rush and really kind of run
into kind of hurry up and pick them out
so I could go
okay I just see my spray um yeah a lot
of people don't use product in here I
actually do it doesn't give me a builder
for anything and actually just helps us
now so better especially when you do
this on fresh air it's really hard to
get the style to stay so this actually
does help I just took up a hard bristle
brush I got from my local boutiques
largest dollar and I use this just comb
my will brush down my leave out that was
looking for join me as you can see and
basically we're gonna just style it at
this point and just comb your hair into
place and this really all depends on the
person you have the pretty much style it
like you wanted I wanted my hair like
there's you clean very big um and you
don't have to have it like this you
could definitely comb these out or brush
them out and have more of a sleeker look
but I wanted them bigger just for
example for position I didn't even put
the - Roger white back here since
eyes on the camera um Lee I used to play
with it pretty much and kind of get the
look that she want especially in the
front and just kind of go from there and
once you get that in place you're pretty
much done and yeah definitely pretty
easy they're very soft and very bouncy
play with it a little bit
all right you know this part is returned
just early and then kind of let it fade
usually I have I live the more valium
right here but I'm not to rewrap it so
it really doesn't serve perfect um but
you know that's pretty much the gist of
it it's not hard to do at all especially
when you get used to it but the flexi
rods do help a lot to give you these
nice pillowy beautiful corals and they
do hold they hold mines usually hold for
a couple of days like I said before this
mind I had the last time I did it was
Saturday so it's Wednesday and they were
still in they were still pretty tight um
so yeah they last you a long time I only
use the the curlers when I first do it
know the reason why I redid it is
because I wanted to show an example but
I do I will do a tutorial on how they
pretty much look if I stomp like thrives
and I just move my head oh this was
highly requested so yeah what they look
like and again I haven't this is my
Shanna's hair emporium hair this is the
body weighed in 2022 2018 and 6:00
for you I will talk to you guys later
