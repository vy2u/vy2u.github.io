do I wrap my hair at night this is not
my weave is sold in it's not sold in
sown in it's not a you party so I can't
take it off um I have to live with it so
a lot of people are asking me what do I
do to wrap my hair at night so I wanted
to show you two ways that I personally
wrap my hair whatever you choose to do
is your business but a lot of people
have asked me for tutorial on it so what
you're going to need for this is you're
going to need a paddle brush whatever
one you choose to use um some small
Clips like this and some bit Clips like
this but it's just the way I do it
personally so you know it's really up to
you so okay
oh and you're going to need a scarf
whatever scarf of your choice I prefer
for people to use a silk scarf because
the silk it is they have to be real silk
it just has to be something that is not
cotton so that it will not absorb cause
cotton will absorb the moisture in your
hair so all this shine I got going on if
I did this with a cotton scarf my song
will be gone in the morning and that
means that my hair is not gonna lay
right uh when I start my day so yeah so
there's two ways that I usually do this
um I take the scarf and I you know do
the basic triangle or whatever you want
to call it and usually what I'll do is
I'll take this side of my hair and do
this and take this side and do this and
then take the scarf and do this okay do
my brows because I'm going on so usually
it will do this and then I usually wrap
it in one direction like this and this
is just so that I can keep the top of my
hair because I'm one of those people
that like my part in a certain
in a certain area so I don't like to
change it some people you know do the
classic roll around and really part the
hair everyday my heart did my hair does
not like the part so I'll just wear my
hair like this
and when I get in the shower I'll put
this up like this and put a bonnet on
and then take it down when I'm finished
and when I get ready to go
I just bust one of these do this grab my
brush do this and I'm ready to go
there's that simple
so if you have you know or even if you
like setting your hair you got flyaways
and you want it to lay down that's a
good technique to do as well
the other way that I do it is a little
more complicated I call it the
crisscross method because again I don't
like to remove my part um from where it
is if you've been wrapping your hair
since a teenager or whatever then you
know most urban people will just
basically do the I call it the spiral
where you just wrap your hair all the
way around you put your scarf on you
just need the scarf so everything can
lay and you take it out with a weave
that's not really an option because
tracks are going to be sliding and
moving and hurting so you don't want
that so what you can do is do basically
what you did before which is take the
side put it behind your ear this side
put that behind your ear and then what
you do is you split your hair in the
middle and a back like this you take
your brush like this and you take all of
this hair and you wrap this side around
like this then you take this side like
this and you wrap this around this side
like this but as you wrap this you take
some clips
and you do this wine with a smaller clip
and then take a bigger clip and you do I
got tracks right here so let me be
careful oh there we go like that
okay now you take this side and you pull
all of this hair just like a criss cross
over here and you do the very same thing
now since I have layers this and if you
are like me this will fall which is
completely fine because you can always
tuck this inside under that's the good
thing is longer since in the correct
direction
okay so you're going to take a clip here
and put it there I put extra clip in a
back just in case it wants to fall in
and stupid and then you put your very
clip here at the top right here so now
you look at oh okay you look really good
and you look like you ready to bust some
heads so what you do after that is you
take that same scarf with the whole V
situation and you put it over all these
damn clips like this you tie its how you
want it you hold it like this and then
you're gonna take these clips out you're
not gonna keep them in some people sleep
with these clips in and the only thing
these clips are gonna do for you as you
sleep is put dents in your hair and
that's not what you want unless that's
the look you going forward then for all
means go ahead so I'm gonna take that
one out I'm just push this back where it
goes I'm gonna take this side went out
from the 10 it's just basically holds
the hair in place just you put the scarf
halfway on you put it a little loose so
you can take the clips out and you just
want this you just did that so that the
hair can stay and know where it's
supposed to go take that one out and
take that back one out and then you take
this like that and you wrap you wrap it
and there you come and my everything on
my hair is in here like it's supposed to
be you take this extra little piece I
always just take this little piece and
wrap it like this and bam there you go
you could go to bed you can have sex you
could do all that um your hair is done
so you you're pretty much good when I
open a gem I roll up I think dude I'm
good
okay so yeah you can wash your face do
your makeup do whatever you got to do
and when you're ready to go you just
take this out and like you did before
take yo calm I mean your brush or you
can use the comb it's up to you and then
just brush down decide you want cuz now
your part is still where it was supposed
to be in the first day in place it has
not moved none and their yoga and your
hair is done you ready to start your day
so it's that simple and you it helps you
keep now as you probably can tell like
right here that's because I put it
behind my ear I always have a crease
right there when I do that unless I pin
it up here but a little run through with
the flat iron just fixes that um but it
doesn't really give me any issues but
the rest of my hair you know I don't
have to go over everything cuz it's like
this when I wake up in the morning I'm
I'm good now I will say if I leave my
hair not done or I leave it wrapped for
like two days I might have to go over
cuz it's gonna be stuck like that but it
gives you no crease in the back or
anything um so yeah that's how I wrap my
hair that's the crisscross method in the
turban method which is the first would
so yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this and
I hope this helped peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
