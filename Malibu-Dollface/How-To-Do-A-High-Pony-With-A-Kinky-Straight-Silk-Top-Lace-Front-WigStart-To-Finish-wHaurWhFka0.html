you can see there is three combs and
this is a silk top area this is the
adjustable strap in the back and as you
can see the tracks the other tracks in
the back as you'll see later on in this
video are just towards the back but the
still top is pretty much like any other
wig so as you can see there is a four by
four section of parting and since this
is gonna go up in a ponytail you really
won't be able to actually see the sub
top area but that's how much space you
would actually have so it's like having
a closure if this I made this unit and
it had a closure it's the same
difference
the only thing that I really don't like
is the fact that I like my silk tops to
be just a little bit just a tad bit more
um it is four by four but the way that
it is put into the wig I'm not a really
big fan of because when it is a silk top
unit I can usually just part it as you
can see all the way back because it's
lace but because these are tracks it's a
little bit different so here I'm just
partying the already cut the lace off of
the unit so I'm just parting the hair
down so you can see this is what the
silk top looks like very natural it's a
little darker than my other ones and
then see you see there's tracks back
here so I would have to stop the part
there I couldn't go further back if I
wanted to and here I just simply comb
the hair up into a higher hairstyle in
the front and left the back down and you
can do this pretty much with any way any
wig that has um tracks like this or a
full lace wig
I just wouldn't try this with a wig that
has a lot of tracks in the back that are
just pretty much you know like I said
like a net cap I don't know how to
explain it but it's kind of like a knit
cap type of situation and then it
probably won't look the best
so you just pretty much gather all the
hair up in the front
make a nice partner back you don't have
to worry about it can see if this was
lace it wouldn't matter but um because
it's not lace it still doesn't matter
because all the hair that is in the back
that you're going to see and I mean if I
were to turn it around you to see me as
a partner back but once it's hair that
in the ponytail it's gonna cover
everything and you just take a regular
rubber band I tend to like to use these
industrial rubber bands on my wigs and I
tend to cut them out I don't pull them
out but they do hold very well elastics
in ponytail holders are not the best
when it comes down to wigs for me
personally so I tend to use these um a
lot more often but see you can't see
anything in the back at all and it's
just that simple the unit is beautiful
it's easy and I just put it right behind
my hairline it's mesh control and there
you go it looks like I have a really
nice tight ponytail and I really don't
