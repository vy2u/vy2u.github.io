how I late this week stay tuned okay so
I'm coming to you
a very unusual today um and that's
because I am going to do a how to lay
your wig from top to bottom with a fresh
wig as you can see right now I only have
my leave out available everything else
it's braided up to turn around
always braid it as you can see these are
separate I'm explaining this because
people wants into my braiding pattern
for you part from the rest of my behind
because when you put tracks on each side
you want it to be really flat and when
you start braiding all of this it starts
to get thicker as you're going up in
here and nobody wants to thick bumpy
braids right here so that's why I do two
single braids right around wherever my
leave out is going to be for eventually
a middle part but this is left out for
the moment um because I have got a new
wig from Wow
african calm they contacted me via
facebook we get it says that it's item
number st w01 the hair color is a
natural the hair length is 22 and it's a
silk top with john oh I love me some
soft rocks go
we're going to just keep umm it has the
the lunch lady net on it as you can see
it feels heavy not heavy heavy but I got
some weight on it which I love look um
so that works because you know I hate a
little thin wig so as to combs on the
side it has the adjustable strap with
the lace in the back and then it has the
lace around the perimeter front part and
then this is what the SIL top looks like
so it actually looks pretty good I think
it's going to be a little on a gray side
compared to my scalp but we'll see if we
can fix that with some good old hit
sealer that I'm gonna cut this off and
then I'm gonna come back to put it on
and we can style and do all that okay so
I went ahead and I cut all the lace off
the front of it um this has a
stretchable cap in here and this is all
of the silk top right here all of this
um so I went ahead and cut that off so
what I'm going to do now is I'm going to
put this stocking cap on these are good
it really doesn't matter what color this
one is because this is so top so you
won't be able to see through it but if
you was wearing like a lace wig make
sure you get like whatever color it
whatever color they have that best
message your scalp please don't wear
this Abunda or black one because it's
just not gonna look right or put a piece
of fabric that's at least that if you're
gonna wear a black police put piece of
fabric over wherever the lace is so that
you know it hides it um so what I'm
doing I'm just gonna put this over it as
a like a natural part in it so I'm not
going to disturb it I'm just going to
make the wig for it um and you know that
usually worked you've gotta make
sometimes you gotta make a wig a little
on a cricket side to make it exactly
what you wanted to be that's we're gonna
do so
remind you I haven't never tried this
wig on or anything I just check it right
out the box so usually this is what they
look like when you first get them
they're very straight they have no
layers in them they're very big um but
this is how long it is
so that's cute this part skull is not
far enough back for me this part needs
to be like she was on the way and never
son gonna come I figured out it wouldn't
know you seen London I thought that I
was fungal couldn't be no wrong
basically off camera I just parted it
where I needed it to be and kind of
defined the part a little bit more and I
just went in with some of this a Garnier
Fructis hairspray just to kind of define
it a little bit better so it wouldn't be
so you know Whiggish it's still a little
further than I would like it but I'm
gonna push it back before right now what
we're gonna do next is um you're gonna
just kind of comb all the hair into
place and since it's a new wig
everything at the top is still rope
Whiggish because you know that's just
that's just what we do but I'm going to
show you how to not make it look
Whiggish and make it look like it's
yours okay so now we're going to do is
you're going to pull the wig back a
little bit like such okay and that's
already looking way better um and then
we're going to find we're going to
define the part so take a rat tail comb
mine's cricket um I have another
it doesn't matter take a rat tail comb
like this okay and they just pretty much
put it to wherever you want that that
part is are the parts gonna be that's
where you're going to pull your hair out
and then you're gonna move it you're
going to pull this back then you're
gonna find where you want your part to
be and then just pretty much brush your
hair and apart pretty much that's like
the best example I could give and as you
can see like that you just pretty much
shift it move it into the direction that
you want so that from as you can see a
distance you really can't tell that the
part is you not connected to yours and
then there's a line of demarcation right
there which is unfortunate I hate that
but there's nothing that a little Mac
concealer won't be able to fix but for
right now we just want to get the
positioning right you just make sure
that's exactly where you want your part
you guys know like a ignorant part so
it's gonna be very far over and pretty
much get all the hairs and we do that is
this you're going to take your hairspray
you're going to spray all of this like
and I mean this much because this is
what's going to get it to hold and then
you're gonna comb it out the way just
gonna comb it where it needs to be and
if it's wet that's perfect because that
means that is gonna give it more time to
hold I'm just pretty much getting to
where you want it for blah blah okay now
we're going to take our trusty old flat
iron and then we're going to gonna just
hit it real hard
maybe did you miss me things have
changed but I'm telling you lady ain't
no fire see these feelings you're
feeling got no feet to walk away yeah I
know you got him but ain't no thing I
rolled the book you can't just turn the
page but it seems to me as you're the
closer that you won't start to see my
way we go always pretty much have it as
late as we can pretty much get it I'm
sure I can get it flatter but it's not
necessary right now I'm not gonna die
but you see I got the AG's out the way I
got the part like I wanted I just now
have to go back in with a little bit of
concealer and conceal that line to make
it all look like one continuous line
right here no game it walk out the door
you'll never be the same you can try if
you're gonna stay away if you wanna it's
a waiting game you're gonna ain't no way
got no fingers I know ain't nobody do it
like me okay don't act the question cuz
you know that the answer is me baby
always I see there you go and this is
work which is where it is owning so yeah
it's a beautiful wig um the cap
construction is great for those who
wanted to know I am going to put up a
review though but that's pretty much how
you lay your wig that's how when you get
a new fresh wig that should be the the
steps or however you want your steps to
go
that's how pretty much it should be
somewhere within there to in in order
for it to look like this before you
leave the house it should be not right
here it should not be looking a mess um
there are too many tutorials on how to
do this I decided to do another one in
HD so you can see it with the fresh wig
like I literally just got this wig out
the box in the mail and yeah so there is
no excuse now for your wig to not look
great okay there's just no excuse I have
literally no hair out but my edges if
you have edges then you can do this
trust and believe they're there this is
not rocket science you just need some
patience a few little tools to help you
out and you can have a late wig as well
so if you have any questions please let
me know I don't think there should be
any questions I think I'm pretty was
pretty detailed about um everything I'll
post everywhere I use the beyond the
zone the Garnier Fructis a paddle brush
a blending brush Mac uh NC 42 concealer
to conceal my part I used the Remington
I forgot what size this is I used my
golden hot
I used my silk elements edge control a
dollar brush some scissors a clip
and a rat tail comb of my choosing and
my good ol handy baby here to brush the
edges but other than that um there's
enough SHINee in a wig obviously you
need a wig or you part or if you have
you can do this with like are you part
with the closure too um if you want to
so yeah if you have any questions like I
said before please let me know this
particular wig was from Wow African wild
African calm um if you wanted to be
interested in this particular unit it is
unit number I think I said it in the
beginning but it is unit number oh oh s
TW 0 1 um and it's 22 inches and it's a
silky texture so yeah I'll talk to you
guys later and I hope you enjoyed this
thumbs up this video if you like it tell
a friend he laid his wig again you know
