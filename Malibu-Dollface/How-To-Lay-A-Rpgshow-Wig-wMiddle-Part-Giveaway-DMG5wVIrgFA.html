have they sent um over the same one it
was custom because of the length so it
did take a little longer than usual but
everything is the same it looks a little
full of their minds because it's still a
little big right here I'm showing you
pretty much I'm going to elongate that
part it is full lace but because of the
cap construction there are areas where
it's a little darker and a little sparse
err because of the cap construction but
I'm gonna show you how to get around
that
I'm back in love
see help
so take any simple holding spray
that you own doesn't have to be this one
in particular and define the part by
spraying it and combing the hair in the
direction you want it to go in as you
can see there looks like there's a ball
spot there and it's not issued because
the cap stops right there and it's not
supposed to go past that but we're
trying to cheat the system here so as
you can see I'm just gonna comb it in a
direction that I want and looks crazy
because it's a white foam head but I put
a new cap up under it so you could see
it here I'm just taking a hot comb
pressing : whatever you want to call it
and this is the best technique to get it
to be real flat because it gets the
roots to lay really really flat you
don't know how to use the pressing comb
do not do this because you may possibly
burn your wig but as you can see the
part is already looking better here
and just take like a brown or black
pencil and just kind of fill in the area
where it looks like it's a space and you
can't see it anymore
well a mix between this hairspray and
the beyond his own gives the beyond the
zone gives it luster and the hairspray
gives it a sort of stiffness what keeps
your hair pinned straight as you wear so
that's all you guys see my hair on
camera it looks very shiny but it looks
very SuperDuper straight because that
flexible holding spray actually helps
the hair hold and right now I'm just
doing a rough pass through it because I
want to go ahead and cut it real quick
but you'll see I'm really getting to
depth of actually laying it down in just
a second
so here I'm just gonna put some light
layers in the front I didn't want to
make them as detailed as mine was
because that was done to frame my face
and that's what layers are for to frame
the person's face and that since I don't
know who's gonna win the wig I can't
necessarily do that because I don't want
them to be too short or too long for the
person so you can take this to your
beautician if you win it and then they
can go ahead and pretty much go from
what I started but that's pretty much
what I'm doing here
just to make it even on both sides and
give it a little bit of umph
I love this beyond his own turn of spray
it is a heat protectant but it also adds
a nice luster to the hair and as you can
see you see that line there here's the
technique if you part just a crown
section of the head and flatiron it then
it'll get the line out so sometimes when
I'm lazy and the wig is not as full as
it normally should be then I can flat
iron it in one spin and then go over the
top like such this is a good spray I use
is usually like nine or ten dollars at
Sally's and I got mines actually to buy
one get one free so if you get this
before hand I would definitely invest in
this because it actually helps the hair
and it smells great and it keeps the
hair very flat
helplessly
it came to me
you're I just want you to see what we
started with versus what we have now
with a little time and effort you can to
make your wigs look like this
and I've done this in the past this is
my old beauty school flatiron but it's
still working and you pretty much use
the corner of your Flatiron to flatten
the roots of this part so that when you
put it on your head it lays recessed and
it's not there you know there's no line
of demarcation between your hair and the
wig everything like it flows into one
and just finish it off with a little
hair spread to get the flyaways down a
little more he protecting just for a
little more shine I'm right after this I
put it right back in the back for
whoever is gonna win this particular
contest but yeah that was it it's nice
and flowy and this is exactly how my wig
looks so you know that's the finished
product I hope you guys you like this
