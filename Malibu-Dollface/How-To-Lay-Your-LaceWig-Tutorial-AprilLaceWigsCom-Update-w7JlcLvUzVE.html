football hinges on hell but I got a
phrase under here so don't worry I'm not
ball headed but um this is a tutorial on
how to lay your neck and um this was
highly requested because a lot of people
after I did the review for the April's
lace wigs might yaki Chinese weight that
I've been rocking everybody name I'm
trying to figure out what did I do to
light my wig so this tutorial is pretty
much gonna show you what I do on the
daily basis or whenever I choose to wear
it cuz I just been in and out of my
shyness hair Emporium you parts and this
wig cuz these are like these are like my
go-to things when I want to get my I'll
have my hair done but I don't feel like
dealing and in my days off where I'm
just like not in the mood to doing all
here and I put on the button they didn't
rock it like this so yeah um yeah um so
this is the wig that I'm going to be
applying which is my April's lace wig
this is the Chinese light yaki um and
this is what the car looks like in the
front um and for those who were asking
for when I need to review on it I said
that the wig was a little on the thin
side so what I decided to do was I just
went in and took some extra wefted hair
and I just put some track
in the inside I think this is its whore
yes for I put four tracks in tomato
water the difference so if you did get
this wig in you because a lot of you
guys have told me that you have brought
the way um and you don't necessarily
like of the thickness of it just get
some lifted hair put it in there and
it's not gonna make no difference as you
can see it did not mess up the
construction of the cap whatsoever it's
just like when you make a you part or
you sewing and sewing is kind of the
same difference
um I have washed his hair so there's
kind of a update / tutorial video I have
watched this entire week and it has not
shed it at all and I don't know what
they did but this did not shed at all I
did that met it not tangle I let it air
dry and he came out just like this well
I did flat iron it says it was a little
on the big side because it is yet but um
other than that though I haven't had no
issues this is like the greatest wig
ever so we're gonna get started what
you're going to need for this is you're
going to need um or any rat tail comb um
some type of edge control of your choice
if you want to use gel you can um some
hairspray everybody was asking although
I did say it in my last tutorial this is
the Garnier Fructis um humidity
volumizing spray that I use you're gonna
need a flat iron and I'm you're gonna
see why in a second not for just
straighten hair / Trinity some next to
me uh and then you're going to need any
oils of your choice you could you
you you know this even use this which I
really do like this or you can use some
of this it don't really matter um
whatever you choose to choose to use is
your business and you're also going to
need some concealer and a brush of your
choice so underneath here I have um my
this the pet the bright pattern and a
half right here is for from when I have
my Sheena's hair frame and I have the
middle out because out of the middle
part that's what the bracelet everything
is rated around and then on the top is
left out but I'm not gonna leave all
that hair out cuz it's a lot of hair in
the front and my leave out so what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna so basically what
I'm gonna do here is I'm just gonna pull
out the perimeter of my hair because we
still want that natural look we do not
want that lace wig look so I'm just
gonna look like a hobo I'm gonna pull
out the my braids are like right there
from my sewing so work for my you part
so basically this is all there that I'm
gonna leave out because I want that
natural look I don't want it to be like
proxy in the front so we're gonna put it
behind the hairline so pretty much you
just put your wig on and you adjust it
to how you wanted and you pretty much
find your part I'm checking out here
under because we're gonna you see where
my scalp is well my hairline is in the
front we're gonna use it this is what I
said don't do do not wear your wigs like
this ladies this is not cute pull it
back so at this point you're gonna try
to find which area I like my parts very
far over to the side like Beyonce at the
inauguration like that just ignorant and
then at this point you're going to just
basically part your hair your real hair
where that part is and just kind of find
where it's going to lay naturally where
that part is going to be because you
want that you want it to look like it
belongs there not like it's not supposed
to be there um
so you just continue to brush and comb
you know the hair up the way make sure
it's still nice and laid um as you see
I'm doing here and as you can see it's
starting to come into place at this
point like it starting to look like it's
supposed to except for that part and you
just kind of play with it to get the
look that you want you know don't be
afraid to get ignorant make it look way
crooked do whatever you need to do in
order to make it exactly what you want
we're going to pull out those sides
because we want that those sides in the
front to look as natural as possible I
didn't do it exactly like I usually do
because I was in a rush when I did this
video but you pretty much get the
concept just play around with it when
you do it in until you get comfortable
with it
and yeah I was just playing with it at
this point and kind of getting to where
I was but I couldn't see so I had to do
a rest off-camera okay so I had to do it
off camera because I'll tell you what I
did because I can't speak that's the
problem but as you can see it's not done
because you can still see that my edges
are not lay like I want them to be and
you can still see right here this is
where the wig stops or whatever so after
that you're going to pretty much chrome
everything into place but you can see
right here because I watched it has just
pump is what you got lace wig pumps that
you don't want and then all the niches
hi we're going to lay all that down cuz
we wanted all to lay flat now remember
when I left some hair out like right
here in the front okay I did that on
purpose
and the reason why I did that is because
when you lay it down like this and we're
going to like all of this you still have
some hair right here so it looks more
natural it looks like it's actually
yours you know instead of have anywhere
cuz it's behind your hairline you don't
want that oh it's not mines look now at
this point if you choose to do it at
this point you can it doesn't really
matter at what stage you do it but you
can take your concealer now and I should
have brought my other brush as I
shouldn't use it I have like a little
fluffy brush I usually use for this but
um you're going to just take it and put
it right here and we're going to bring
it all the way out here okay
now usually at this point I have like a
like you know those blending brushes
that you use for your for your eyeshadow
creases I usually use one of those but I
don't have it with me right now so I'm
in giddy
okay at this point you're just basically
limiting your concealer and blend it out
and try to blend that line there was a
piece of hair so this entire video that
I did not notice until I looked at that
little black piece right there
and I didn't notice it until after the
fact that it was still there and I
should have just reported it but
whatever looks you pretty much get plain
um so you're gonna just keep combing it
we're gonna keep brushing each other
you'll riskily we're gonna try and get
it to lay as possible as as flat as
possible and as you can see I'm going to
use my edge control and we're gonna use
this while I let the hair out in the
front because you see how it kind of
seamlessly blends in the front to source
my hairline it's not this artificial
hair line that obviously as you see my
hair line cannot be duplicated uh but uh
Eddie Munster in front of everything
else so trying to put that right on my
hairline it's not gonna work but to have
that little piece out right there like
everything in the front and have it
pulled back does help a whole lot
because it just makes it look so much
more natural I put some gel on the edges
only because are you go wrong stuff I
have that guy's to be glued that I used
to use it to glue it down with this gel
but it works the glue um but I didn't
use it because I'm not wearing this I'm
gonna put my you part back on but yeah
that's pretty much it as far as to kind
of blend it out and put it where you
want it to be just play with it okay at
this particular point
you should have something that looks a
little like this um yeah it should
initially something like this it's best
to comb like your side hair like the
little hair that you left out right here
it's best to try and comb it like
towards like fish because if you do this
it gives it more of a natural appearance
then it just being like a piece right
here that comes all the way down that's
not necessarily what you want and then
of course these little pieces that are
left right here for my real hair look
like it's just all coming into this now
what I do at this point is I take some
my hair spray and I spray this part and
this part and let me show you why
because I don't like that pump we're
gonna take the flat irons you can do
this with some curling irons too but I
tend to use these just so I don't burn
because I can be you're gonna take this
like the little the pieces right here
that our minds all burnt up from the OH
- flat iron you're gonna just go like
this - and this is gonna make a world of
a difference
and how your hair ladies because you
want it to be able to lay super flat you
don't want no hump no bumps okay and
then just do it right at the part
John put it on if the still top just
time what you want okay you just want to
get it to lay dang okay so they think
they at this point I'm just gonna go
through and you know really just lay it
down like lay it but yeah as long as you
continue to keep doing this you're not
gonna damage your way because when I
watched it they came back and pop back
just like you know it was close to but
you see how there's a big difference as
far as how thick it was at the root
versus how it is now and as you can see
the more I do it the flatter is going to
get now how I got the little piece out
the way this would have been a flawless
install but I was rushing because I had
somewhere to go and I was trying to get
through the video but yeah at this point
I'm just running the flat ironing
through it um kind of just giving it a
little bit of oh I guess you could say
um putting some of the organic coconut
oil mist in it just for some shine and
my favorite heat protection spray just
for a little more I like the smell of it
really and it works well but I really
like the smell and this just going to
get the hair to the lay because this is
a yucky here it does at times one to
tangle just a little so this stuff
actually does help it prevent it from
tangling because it basically gives it
gives you more of a sleep feel so I mean
it doesn't want to necessarily nap up or
get tangled or whatever
and pretty much this is it you can
adjust it as you want you know move it
how you want to and kind of get the look
that you're going for and I just washed
it and that's pretty much it right here
I'm just showing you this flat it's um
really really flat if no bumps no lumps
or anything so that method actually does
work a whole lot and this is the
finished product look myself top is a
little bit darker than my actual scalp
because I washed it so all of the
concealer is now all and if you are
interested in this particular wig this
is 24 inches of Chinese
light yaki um hair over at April's lace
wig and I will put the link to my review
on it at the bottom and I'll also put
the link to the actual wig at the bottom
as well if you're interested like I said
I did add tracks to this because it was
a little on a little too thin for my
liking but since I've added those tracks
so it's perfect I have no issues no
shedding nothing so this is definitely
one of my old faithful this is the
faithful until I get a replacement
that's gonna change this yeah I would
like to try a different texture though I
probably would try a silky texture but I
really do like this I'm putting press oh
good I'm right gonna put some elastic
bands in it so that it doesn't shift at
all like when I move I could do this or
whatever and that's just because I may
be ended but yeah um I hope you guys
enjoy and I will talk to you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
