so you know what that means I mean this
is another laying tutorial so this is
for not a straight wig this is actually
a different wig um this way comes from
April's lace wigs remember like a while
ago I think the first wig I ever
reviewed was for April's lace wigs which
I still wear that way to this day which
was my light yaki one-in-a-million a wig
that's still going very strong level so
this is a new way this is their Italian
Yankee wig um some of you guys nah
posted this on Instagram and I was like
just blow-dried my hair because it looks
so natural and so real like it could be
mines so you know but no it's not mine
but however I will insert a picture I
promise what my hair look my natural
hair looks like when it's blow-dry so of
course it came from DHL you guys know it
came with a wig line it was the wig cap
thank God because I hate one company
semi wig liners and just FYI this little
bump right here just this very drastic
part I got going on this because my
leave out is right here so it's braided
back but because it's hair has so much
value in one meal Brazil embassy yay
came with two away caps and then it came
with the actual wicked so what I'm gonna
do is I never cut the lace off on camera
so I'm going to speed it up without I'll
do it just to show you um of course it
comes with this and then I've already
opened the way justice O has clips in it
so my normal parts gonna be but this is
pretty much the wig it's very cool and
very textured um so it has the you know
the lunch lady cap on the front on the
top rather and I'm gonna take this off
and then this is the unit so the unit is
a still top unit and it's very big and
very fluffy and you know all that good
stuff because I take it out and then put
it back in Drake I like a little bit of
a dent in it but it's whatever okay so
as you can see in the inside it has two
combs right here and then there's two oh
three combs in the back as a stretchable
panel in the inside so it does stretch
to fit your head and then also as the
silk top is all of this right here so
we're going to just cut somebody out a
few people message me and say that they
try to cut the lace off their wigs and
then they cut it too close to the silk
top there is a line right here that you
do not want to go past and sometimes I
leave the line still on there um I mean
well I leave the lace a little past the
line because I used that too if I want
to achieve this down like a little
spirit gum on my part or something so I
won't move I can use that and I put it
on the actual silk top because the lace
can be you know washed off and you can
get the rest of the glue off but you
can't do that on it so top you do that
on it so Stoppers wrap this is what the
scalpel is up top looks like so this is
the lace and this is the so top you see
there is a difference so what I'm going
to do is whenever you receive one of
these wigs what you want to do is where
the hell is that clip okay whatever
um what you want to do is you want to
clip the hairs back away from the actual
lace so this is the lace and this is
what we're going to cut off but all of
this we want to key so this is the side
of the ear tab we're going to take this
you're going to take your scissors and
then you're just pretty much going to
wherever the lace starts is where you're
going to cut it so just simply take this
and get the cut now there are very
sparse hairs because they're baby hairs
I hate what companies for baby ears on
own leagues and I don't really too much
mind on when they are minima but when
they have them like all dipped down like
Brandis Barbie that's not cute
I'm just going to take your scissors and
he's going to cut around the hairline
teach me No
okay now that we have all the lights off
you see now this is what the unit looks
like in the front now or whatever what
I'm doing here is I'm taking like a very
mout temperature um hot comb and pretty
much to open up the part a little bit
because the hair is so thick and
textured just to give it a little more
of a relaxed look it's not so coarse
at the root to get more of this flip
over look okay at this point what I'm
going to do is I'm showing you how thick
the hair actually is I'm positioning my
part where I want it to be in here I'm
going to pull out some hair of course
around the edges just to give it more of
a natural appeal you don't want it to
look all boxy and edge it up like you
like ninis you don't want that um so my
hair is trying to be straight in the
front so it was a little difficult at
first to try to get it to be as coarse
as this but after a while of trying I
pretty much did what I wanted here I'm
just defining the part where I wanted to
be
we need to take your fingers and run
amok my strange
here I'm gonna put just a little bit of
gel on the edges because the hairs of
course you'd only use edge control
because it's for straight hair so this
just pretty much helps to blend much
easier here is the old concealer trick
and we're just gonna put this just to
blend the part in my hair you know
seamlessly so there is no line of
demarcation pretty much it's simple as
to the point you know exactly what it
does it just hides what you shouldn't
see SuperDuper natural-looking
like it looks like okay he has a line
here and it's crazy because my natural
hair looks like this when I when I like
blow-dryer or whatever this is what it
looks like so yeah it's not that hard
for this unit is very easy you can put
this hair in some plots you can actually
like rows over a trace to where I can
actually lay all of this down and then
make this into some actual cornrows and
you wouldn't be able to because there's
um everything is laced in the back so
it's just some top that's here and then
the rest of it back here is actually
lace so the thing about it is is you can
arms you won't know honestly that this
wouldn't be mine because I could part it
all the way down to the back the only
thing is the knots are not bleached on
the neck so I'll have to go and bleach
wherever I put that part or bleach the
whole thing which I'm going to do but
besides that though this is all the
texture that's in it look at that if
this don't look like no relaxed
african-american here I don't know what
doesn't like this legitimately looks
like it could be my look look at my
edges
it looks like it could be mined this is
exactly what my hair looks like if I
wouldn't let it Bend up like this you
get to see how it was a gentle benjin
and when I took it off the damn bag but
other than that is um yeah this week is
available April's lace wigs I'm going to
review it next because I've had it for
quite some time and when I for sometime
for my like a week and that's a long
time for me could you see what I get
wigs I would do them right away but no I
wanted to actually see you know what
does this all wore it a few times um
around the house because obviously I am
walking around outside with the lace on
it but yeah I just worried around the
house and stuff like that and it don't
get me no tangles and I think because my
other one was a light yaki and it did
snag in the back or what get one a
tangle in the back because that's just
what yaki hair does but because this is
all Italian yaki and it's you know it's
meant to be this big it you could still
do this you can still run your fingers
through it because everything is the
same texture it's not two textures in
one so it's trying to mimic something
and the other piece is trying to do
something else oh yeah
I hope this helped and if you are
interested in this wig make sure that
you go to earth box make sure that you
go to April's lace wigs I will put the
link to this week below as well as in my
review video I will put it in there as
