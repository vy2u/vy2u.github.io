a really strong band on it and as you
can see these are what I used to use and
a lot of you guys have commented that
your units were small and these caps
they do stretch but not as much as I
would like them to these are the ones
that I decide to use and as you can see
it's a lot of stretch so I do it's a lot
of more material at the top so I just
fold it down to give me more of a
reinforcement in the back and they
stretch much better okay guys so I said
I was gonna do this again but I got a
lot of people asking questions about the
flip over method what the fold-over
method versus the cutting method that I
used in my last one so I went ahead and
put this together because I wanted you
guys to see what the difference was so
I'm using Mario's hair and I'm using
their straight believe this they're
straight Peruvian um I'll have all
information for that for this hair and
my upcoming review and my install video
but this video is just pretty much to
show you what it looks like and as you
can see I just take one side and I fold
it over I make sure that I for the most
part like I guess you cuz I nail it down
what um so the the method in which I'm
using for this that's kind of why just
do it together because you guys get it
in the UM other video that I did which
I'll link below for the full details of
everything but yeah this is just you
literally just fold one side and you
when you fold them don't literally fold
it over where it's parallel fold it and
pull it up a little bit higher than the
initial track so that you're going to
create this a slight zigzag the slight
zigzag as you're sawing down so
therefore you're going to go up just a
little bit a little bit more what I will
say is for those who are doing this if
you had issues with sizing cap wise then
do not do this method and I couldn't
remember for the life of me like why I
stopped doing this and then after I did
this wig I realized when it was tight as
hell that it does because you're not
cutting anything
it has no stretch so it's really just
pulling from side to side and side to
side which then in hindsight makes your
unit much smaller than you what intended
to be mine's fit as you'll see at the
end it does fit but the problem kind of
that I have is that it's very very snug
so I had to kind of cut a couple of
slits in just for it to fit and because
I'm doing this on a mannequin head if
you do get a wig block to do your wigs
on in this approximately your size you
will not run into this problem but
because I'm using a standard mannequin
head which is actually probably the size
smaller than my head is then yeah that's
where I kind of run into this issue so
remember that this method is a practical
method to minimize or you know have no
shedding at all but you have to remember
that it does require you to use
something that's a little approximately
a little closer to it no matter what um
whatever cap you use it's very different
um when you do this so keep this in mind
so that's pretty much all I'll say about
that I will link the hair that I'm using
a below if you guys are interested in
this before I put out the review and
then later on this week I will post my
initial my review about this hair so
yeah enjoy and I'll see you guys later
three two
now
No
um so I did cut the ends of this even
though I folded them if there's a little
piece left I'm not gonna create a fold
just for a centimeter of a piece it's
just so unnecessary so those little
pieces I am gonna cut but for the most
part everything else is folded over and
at the top I had to cut them because of
course I had quite a bit of hair I
wasn't able to fit all four bundles on
here um because it just didn't give me
as much also doesn't give me as much
space as I would like to because I'm so
used to using four bundles so I'll
double the backs the problem with that
and folding them over is that it's it's
gonna be pretty bulky in the back so
that's another reason why I don't choose
to use this it just if I want as flat as
you guys know my hair is I can not I'm
not cutting my straight hair if I wanted
to be super duper duper flat and I'm
using four bundles it's either I
sacrifice half of a bundle to a bundle
or I have to cut them so it's one of the
two I was a charge upon to Swift and
more than was with her but
it's still less than what you deserve
ask it a baby mine excessively seeing
you with him God tell me yes
yeah
ha ha
I should
ever take
Specter had to come
I shall of
it's a new now that Rococo thought
because I love stone I know that I miss
talking to you when I came through it is
just a little time I'm mama just ahead
of mine
yeah
you
after all the time
No
I explained
try to handle at home I'd like to see
you
ah
late and father
be taken
we take now
oh not sitting on the chair with
some be gone bingo
three let you
now
this time
ha
you
you're waiting for me now I gotta wait
for you yeah yeah
yes I shall know
out here with the house alone engine no
I had my feet home now it's true I built
a fence for you
I was a job but you wanted me to this
way if you're more than was with her but
it's still less than what she'll desert
ask it a baby mine exclusively seeing
you with him God to me yes
yeah
yeah whatever
come on
ha ha
ever take
Specter had Al's too
it's a Nunavut Raqqah not because I love
I know um that mean it works out is it
looks beautiful when you're done I just
tend to do this a lot more on my curly
hair because it's much easier as you'll
see I actually have a version of this
with my curly hair that I'm
contemplating and putting up or not on
the shore but uh we'll see but you'll
see how my curly unit um came out and
it's yeah it's like night and day
but
I expect
try to handle night at home
I bought to see with
Oh
clean and fun
I would be taken
we taken out
nice
oh not charity gonna treat you
No
you waited for me now I gotta wait for
you yeah yeah
yes I should know
out here with my house alone engine no I
had one Vietcong pilot true I built a
feelings for you I was a troubled
reported me Swift and more than was with
her but still less than what you deserve
it ask it a baby mine exclusively seeing
you with him God to me
oh yeah
ah
to make
ha ha
ah okay and as you can see here I'm just
gonna close up the top and then you're
pretty much done so as you can see I see
here I had to definitely cut the top and
like reso really hard to make sure that
them corners were lay down and that's
sort of the problem that I run into is
that if my if I am doing this method I
have to make sure I double triple triple
triple triple double triple og like sew
them down because if not it's every
corner on this wig is gonna show so yeah
just make sure you guys are very
thorough with making sure that this is
as flat as you can get it if it doesn't
feel right if it doesn't look right
so again until it's laying down flat
it's al okay
okay so I do have a new pair of contacts
in right now these are the natural
colors crystal I really like these a lot
but I have like no makeup on at all but
this is what my hair looks like after I
did that I have not put any heat to it
I haven't did anything to it um since I
have constructed this entire week so I'm
gonna do a styling video and an install
video to show you guys what I do once I
cut this off and lay this down and I did
this part based on it being wet after I
bleached the knots so yeah so make sure
you guys look out for the styling
portion of this which will actually be
for to wig it's gonna be this one and
it's definitely going to be for this one
too so yeah I'm kind of swimming in here
right now so um I've been testing this
one out I just haven't cut it off I
don't ever cut it until I'm ready to do
really you know glue it down but I've
been testing this this curly hair not
really like this texture a whole lot
better than my other textures because
it's much more curly and the Front's
whole actually looks good so we'll get
to all of that
soon but I hope you guys enjoyed this
and make sure you check out mine Hanks
