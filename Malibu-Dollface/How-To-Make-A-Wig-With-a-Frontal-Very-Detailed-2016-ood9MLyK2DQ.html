for this particular look I'm using the
same hair just different lengths because
this wig was actually made for my friend
Kiana who played Keesha in my screen
Queens um short film she played my
assistant so this is for her wig so what
you're gonna need is some good old
threads and combs
I like these spandex caps a frontal and
your hair with a Styrofoam cap so this
is going to be a little fast because
this video is very long so I'm using
only three bundles in the front so so
I'm using a 20 or 22 and a 24 and I
believe my frontal is a 20 inch frontal
so we're gonna bleach the nut so I like
to use VW bleach and we're gonna mix
this bleach just so that the consistency
is thick enough that it does not bleed
through your hair so you won't end up
with a whole bunch of blonde edges so
you pretty much mix it in till this part
like cottage cheese it looks like that
like pasty so that it will just sit on
top of the nuts but it will not
penetrate and turn your hair blonde
so um thankfully and I'll do this in a
separate video of this frontal was
already when she cuz she ordered his
hair on her own she I just told her what
the link was they don't know that we
know each other we don't even live in
the same city this is the hair that she
received and they actually are starting
to I believe um shipped their frontals
out already plug because this one was
pre plucked before so I didn't have to
do it but I'll do a separate video on
that as well as the installation this
video will only be for how to pretty
much make and construct the wig not how
to put it on this dolly because it's
kind of lengthy and it's very detailed
so yeah here I'm just gonna keep taking
um the bleach and I'm gonna I'm not
really pressing it and I'm really just
moreso sitting it on top but I'm put
enough to where I know it's gonna it's
laying on top of the knot and it will
have contact with them and
it will be depending on how meticulous
you are I personally like to bleach most
of the lace in the front as well because
you're going to cut it off too but I
don't want to like stop at a certain
point because when you do bleach it it
does change our lace color from whatever
color it was rather be a light brown or
transparent it's going to change it to
more of a nicer color
well more fleshy color rather um 40
minutes is what I usually do because I
find 30 minutes is just not long enough
and it doesn't really pull for me so I'm
gonna here I like to put conditioner on
it after I rinse it then wash it in put
more conditioner I find when I put just
shampoo on it right afterwards it's a
little hard but this actually kind of
counteracts the bleach and makes it a
little bit more flexible and durable and
my the little hair is the baby hairs
that I did bleach aren't so wiry they
seem like the half of this softer um
when all is said and done so that's what
I'm doing here and you can use any
shampoo of your choice just make sure
it's not just really hella cheap cuz it
will definitely tangle your hair so I
just used my Giovanni's 50/50 shampoo
and I use my organics coconut milk
I think conditioner
so this is what it looks like excuse me
afterwards has a very nice natural
looking hair line to it
so these caps I like to fold the cap up
underneath itself if you guys are trying
to having a hard time following this
because it's so fast just slow it down
and the annotation menu so I pin both
sides down like such and I use it pretty
much I pull it to where it's over my
hairline the hairline of it not the baby
here but the actual hairline of the
frontal meets the cap so we're gonna
just go ahead and section that off so
thready it depends on how you do it this
is how I'll do mines I take one piece I
pull it through we make two pieces and
then we cut the ends and we knot it at
the end it's just gonna ensure that you
have some reinforcement and that one
little stitch or that one little piece
of thread rather is not the only thing
keeping your trucks from falling off
your cap this is definitely going to
keep things nice and snug and very very
very very very tight so I like to knot
the ends and cut the little piece off
and we're ready to talk so what I like
to do is I go ahead and cut this egg all
frontals don't come like this sometimes
they'll be comes they'll come without
your lace on the side so it just depends
on you I like to leave a little bit of
lace it gives me a little seam allowance
when I'm sewing so that I'm not sewing
directly into my frontal end it's not so
tight that it starts to pull and rip so
I like to leave a little bit of the lace
on it um and also I hide that lace when
I start to put my track to so you don't
see it when all the sitting
um a little bit of blind you see around
the edges can be plucked out but you
really don't when I was sitting down so
I do the loop and pull method sometimes
you're gonna get like how I got here
a little stuck and it's not going to
pull through its gonna wanna not on you
I'm using nylon thread by the way cuz I
know someone's gonna ask I don't like
cotton cuz it gets really really really
um tangles so I like to use my line so
our so one side down and then I do the
very same on the other side the reason
why I like these caps is because they
stretch so they fit anybody's head so I
don't have to necessarily worry about um
trying to make it fit for one specific
head I could wear this way my sister's
could wear this wig you could wear this
you know I'm saying it's just kind of
versatile for everybody because we're
gonna cut the middle out we're done so
here I'm just gonna do the loop and pull
and I may get a little more in-depth
about how I'm sewing this once we get
towards the tracks because this is super
close together it's hard to explain but
here I'm gonna just I'll explain when I
get to the back exactly what I'm doing
to ensure that your tracks don't buckle
and they don't move or they don't show
okay so once we got the two sides down
we're gonna do now we're gonna do the
top and you pull it in is the hardest
thing to explain but when you are sewing
you're going to sew in a circle pretty
so pretty much you're gonna do the loop
and pull but always make sure that the
the thread is behind the needle when you
do that and you'll see what I mean once
we get to the tracks it's gonna create
this like fenced in type of patterns
which is gonna cause your tracks to lay
flat in there no matter if your head is
small big whatever it's not gonna bubble
and start to create gaps in the back of
your head it's gonna actually look very
natural and
seamless and very slow
this is a very to miss thing this is
what and then this was very hard for me
to do because I'm so used to doing this
not on camera so if I'm all over the
place you know why I did this I just got
out the hospital after asthma attack I
was very tired and I was just trying to
hurry up and get things out because I
was slipping on just my videos I was
exhausted so excuse that but it was
gonna be perfect I just set out some did
okay so this is the top part that I'm
doing and for whatever reason this is
the same meant that I used in my last
video with curly hair a lot of you guys
y'all requested straight hair but this
is about as close to juggling it's the
same difference when I do do the styling
video for some straight hair I'll just
do one that I already did that straight
then um I'll show you how I lay
everything down after I do it but this
is the same method I use for every
single one of my wigs and when you do
show your frontal you want to make sure
that I like to have you see I'm doing
them I'm so I'm very very close together
so these are her bundles I believe this
are 24 inch normally I would double the
backs cuz if I have four bundles but
since I only have three and we have to
stretch this out to make sure it fits
evenly we're gonna just single all of
them so as you see I'm gonna go through
and as you can see it's going to start
to make this fence type pattern which
I'm drawing show here in this ensures
that none of my trucks are going to move
this is the most important thing if you
don't do anything else right you have to
do this partner um and you just want to
make sure that's why I like to fold the
cap because when you do fold it it makes
it extra durable for that backtrack so
therefore nothing is gonna move so you
see all in the back is just as one
pattern and it's very easy to do you put
the thread through I like when they
begin rather let's go to that in the
beginning I like to actually take the
thread and put it through the weft then
I like to make a knot and then I
our two souls so I'll make a through the
web do a nice and then I'll go through
the cap make a knot then I start to sew
so as you can see I'm going through and
I put it through my front to the back of
my front to where that lace was to and I
just made a knot now I'm gonna go
through the cap okay then we're gonna
loop it and then we're looping right
behind right behind right behind
and right behind so that's what you do
when you move around make sure that
that's right is behind so that way you
can make sure that it's looped and it's
pulled like it's supposed to be now when
I do when I started in like as you guys
can see I had ran out of I ran out of
thread sorry and what I did was I went
ahead and started a new one when I do
start a new track I put it through like
I didn't begin and I put it through the
left and then I start looping again if
you don't it's the possibility that
because those two piece of thread are
not connected from one end to the other
you can end up with a loose track so to
avoid that put it through the weft and
then go forward okay
so here we go we're going to go through
through then we're going to make a knot
now we can start looping so therefore
your anchor is very very very tight and
then you just go ahead and you can make
this closer if you want to I like to do
them pretty spaced out because I find it
takes just so much longer for no reason
and I'm using twice as much as thread uh
twice as much thread than I would want
to so you see here so I'm just gonna
look through the back and then you go
ahead may I put it behind and you pull
it so pull it behind and this is gonna
take a little practice for those who are
not if you're not well versed in sewing
or wigs or anything this is gonna
probably take you a couple of tries to
get so this but you see as I'm pulling
it none of our tracks are moving so
we're gonna pull it
and once you get to the end when I get
to the end I like to put it through the
weft again wrap it around pull it hold
it and then BOOM dad not gonna stay at
the end I can cut that off and then I
can cut my truck usually I'll cut the
track first then also I go ahead and
lock it down so that's pretty much what
you're going to repeat for this the
pattern that I like to do is just from
one side to the other some people like
to do up and down it just depends on
what type of person you are and what you
like to do me personally I like to just
go from one side to the other side
because I know my hair is going to be
even um so yeah you just keep going and
I like to put my trucks right on top of
each other um with a little bit of space
so as I'm sewing I'm moving up every so
slightly every time I put another track
so again here at the end is something
that is tedious this particular track
was the last one of that 24 bundle and
because she only had three bundles I
couldn't just take it they not like all
24 so I couldn't take this extra piece
and use it at the top I had to use it in
the back so I'll put it in the middle
and evened it out to make sure that it
was placed directly in the middle I went
ahead and tie the knot cut it then I
went through the arm left again through
the cap and then I started sewing again
so that way I can make sure that
everything is nice and tight so if she
decides she wants to do a back flip in
her damn wigs she can uh this hair is
from amazing hair this was the hair in
the beginning of this video that I had
and I still have um and yup
the hair is cool it's not the greatest
hair ever but it definitely isn't bad in
my opinion you know saying it's very
satisfactory for the prices there um
give
for any head upfront swear that was
already plug which were in very well
pluck might I add um so this is I wanted
to continue to show this because a lot
of people said in my last review they
wanted to see me do the entire way
because I cut some stuff out for time
reasons but okay this which I wonder
sure so again um here I'm just doing the
same method and it's very tedious it
takes for freaking over but um to ensure
that your hair um last and it's it's
nice and it's neat you have to just kind
of take out the time to do so and this
is why it took me so long to do this
because it does take a long time to do
and it's very difficult to do this in
front of a camera in front of a light
you know and I usually I'm just watching
TV sitting down doing it in my lap I
don't have to worry about having it on
the counter in front of make sure my
hands are in view and the um it the
angle is right in that whole thing
so I guess you guys can see that the top
is like extra material on the cap and
that's because that's what you want you
don't want to be super loose but you see
it's a little space so it does get some
stretch so when I do so these are trucks
on whomever will put this wig on can
still fit it um and in the beginning of
this I did cheap you'll see at the end
when I'm done I did cheat a significant
amount of the front will forward so that
when I pull it back it will fit my head
or whomever's head and it covers their
hairline if you put it like a closure
where when you have a closure I usually
put it right on where the cap stops and
I'll slow it down because they're not
going to move but for this you want it
to be a little more forward so that you
can have the flexibility to pull it back
because if you if it's just pulling
because all your tracks are in them back
remember that so your unit is going to
be a little more way down in the back
than it would be with a closure because
you're putting your closure tracks on
the side as well so it's going to
balance it out this is all the tracks in
the back the punches on the front so
remember keep that in mind so to have a
balance and your hair is not pulling
even if you put an elastic band in it
you still want the person to be able to
pull it and adjust it to whatever their
hair line may be because all of our hair
lines are very different okay so now
we're here in the back and at this
particular point it's gonna stop curving
so much you're gonna start to kind of go
from side to side so as you see I'm my
tracks are making a guideline around my
frontal so as you continue to wrap them
you're gonna just keep wrapping and
leave like just a little bit of space
between each track you don't want them
to be super spaced out but you
definitely don't want them to be too
close especially towards the top because
it's gonna start to look bulky and this
is one of the keys of getting your
installs to be SuperDuper do do pretty
flat if you make sure that um
when you're sewing you're sewing them
very close together like this I'm gonna
get much closer here than I would that I
was in the back because here you want to
make sure that curvature of the top of
your head will cause your tracks to be
bulky and show if you don't make sure
it's really really close so that's why
here because it's I mean to me because
it's less hair it's um it gives you the
opportunity to I mean here the tents the
tracks are shorter rather I don't have
to it's not like I'm doing the whole
back part of my head it's just this top
piece so I really don't mind making them
shorter you can do what you want but for
me personally um yeah so here and then
here at the top I'd like to double not
just to be on the safe side so no tracks
are showing no ends are hanging off or
anything there's nothing worse than
seeing somebody you can see all the
tracks it's just tacky and it's nasty in
esteem so here I'm just gonna go ahead
and do the same thing we're going to pin
this down and we're gonna do the same
braiding method that we were doing
before this one I pulled up a little
higher because I'm creating a little bit
of space in between the two what you're
seeing right now may seem like it's the
top of my head but in actuality it's the
back of my head well it's the there's
not a very back but it's sort of the
back because the crunch hole that you're
looking at is actually all the way on
the face of the mannequin so I'm gonna
pull all this back which you'll see in a
second so this is definitely a piece
that um you want to make sure cuz it's
still the top no matter what so you want
to still make sure that this is very
flat and it does not move whatsoever it
needs to look like it's growing right
out of your scalp and it will not look
like that if the top of your unit is
very big and bulky and it does not lay
right
okay and then we're going to do that
we're going to keep going and we're
going to keep doing the same thing that
we have been doing which is we're going
to pull cut and some and this does I
mean the more you practice with it and
you find the things that work best for
you these are things that I personally
do but you make can take some of these
things as a general idea and make your
own that's what I've been able to do um
if you don't know how to thread a needle
if you don't know how to sew tracks in
and stuff like that don't put in the
video or the comments I don't it's too
fast I don't know what you're doing this
is where people who pretty much got a
general idea of how to do it but you
need to understand placement of tracks
and um you know that's because I'm not
about the building classes on how to
make way people I did it once you guys
asked for it again with some different
type here and I did not good do this
again um it's just time consuming and
it's very tedious
to not only do but to edit as well so
this is what we're gonna do we're going
to go ahead and not the ends of it and
here I like to go through a few times
just if I don't feel like the the ends
are laying down like I want to I'll keep
threatening going over it until it's as
tight as I can get it to lay down and
then as you can see here
with a place where you know
and then here we're pretty much we're
closing it up so I'm leaving a nice uh
yeah I don't know it was like a purple
hair I don't know it looks like a filler
to me but um yeah so we're going to go
through this again and we're just
closing it up at the top and as you can
see I'm spreading the hair at the top a
little bit more than I was in the back
because all of that hair and the frontal
is gonna cover anything that you may
possibly see so because she got three
bundles we wanted it to look as nice and
as flat as possible so we're gonna we
have to leave a little bit more space if
this was four bundles I most likely
would have doubled the backs in single
the tops like I usually do I mean I did
that in my other video which will be
listed below as well if you want to
watch Darwin for some extra tips um not
this on up cut it and
so I think this might be he had a second
to last track because I want to leave
yeah it's a second to last because I
want to leave a little space
like I said in between the two of these
so here we go we're almost done
did you just sit around that
my
even prize
and when you start to get to the top
where your readings here at the back of
the front will start to show the track
at the the corners of this track start
to sell those into the frontal so when
you start to scoop and go through the
cap go through the frontal - it's going
to make everything much tighter and it's
going to stay together so just like
allies this is the second semester so
you'll see once I get to that very last
one and I only had like a little bit of
hair that didn't go all the way but I
was able to actually cheated and you can
do so your try placement is very very
very important because if it is not it's
you gonna be able to tell it's just
gonna go your hair you're not gonna hang
right it's gonna look terrible so as you
can see I'm going through the frontal
we're going to cut this piece off and
I'm gonna go through the frontal wrap it
and then knotty and then I'm going to go
ahead and pick
and then this is the last track so you
see I kind of ran out of here just in
this little section but what you can do
if you run out of here and this is only
for a small section if it's a big
section I would take one from the back
or something because it's gonna look
crazy but what you do is you go ahead
and not that last the last track and
just go ahead and scoop it through the
captain through the frontal and you know
by what ever be able to tell it's gonna
be a tad bit of a gap but if you don't
plan on throwing your hair all the way
around town you should be fine
as you can see here I went ahead and
knotted it down and I nodded twice
because I was my last one and cut
alright so now we're gonna take all the
pins and the clips and all that good
stuff up see how I'm pulling it back so
now you see where I was just sewing is
in the very back is not at the top so
that makes if that makes any sense so we
gonna dump all this out I like to use
styrofoam heads because even though you
get this little fall out at the end
sometimes the regular block heads if you
sew through it you're sometimes your wig
it's like sewn to the thing and then you
can't take it off you have to like cut
it out so here I'm cutting the addition
of the this is the cap piece so remember
when I put the frontal on the cap and I
pinned it down all that fabric that was
up underneath I cut out because we don't
need that so then you're gonna take it
and you're gonna put it back on there so
you see now you can see everything so
this looks like a fresh head you can
this is all my bleach knots everything
looks great um it looks seamless can't
tell the hairline looks great in a
second I'll show you what it looks like
actually on me so this is the exact
thing I did for that Blake that was in a
very fun nothing is different from this
one aside from the fact that I plucked
that one and I didn't pluck this one and
I she liked their job much better than
mines so boom there you go you can pull
it up no tracks are showing at all on
this unit can't tell I could do a
front-flip on it and you're good
Caroline what's really really really
good her ghost
oh so this part so a lot of people asked
about the elastic band this is super
simple if you can show him you can show
this you find the ear tabs which are the
ends of your wigs find those and right
behind those so I should find a strap
these traps you can get their elastic
straps you can get them as salaries you
can get them at Michael's Joanne's you
just saw them in and sew it in where
it's a little tight not too tight cause
I've done mine too tight at times in a
hurry here you go here's what the
hairline looks on this one here's from a
little bit distance and yeah that came
out really great she's in love and this
would look like on me before I cut it
and I'll show you the cutting process in
actual styling video but this was a
little lengthy so and chill</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
