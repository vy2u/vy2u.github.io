construct this because there is gonna be
a link at the bottom for that particular
portion this is more dealing with the
plucking and curl diffusion aspects so I
have some slanted mr. tweezer tweezers
and we're gonna just go around to get
this line out this is a frontal that had
no plucking it was not pre pluck for all
you guys who don't know how to do this
I'm here to show you it's very simple
you could use if you're started out
doing this I would suggest you use these
and not the point ones the pointed ones
can if you don't know what you're doing
they can puncture the lace which is
gonna make the situation even worse but
as you can see there I'm trying to take
out this the very obvious line around
here in the front and the reason why you
want to do this is because no one's hair
line looks like this I mean unless and
you know Theresa from Jersey but that's
about it so what you want to do is
pretty much try to make this as not thin
cuz you don't want to bald it out but if
you look at your natural hair line if
you have edges no shade I'm not judging
I'm just saying everybody isn't so close
then you'll notice that it's a little
bit more sparse around the hairline than
it is in the back of the hairline now I
do notice when a lot of people do this
they'll plug it really good until a
certain duct like a certain an area like
let's just say to like behind the ear
and then stop so when their hair is
curly or what you can see that it gets
real dents in the back so you kind of
want to have this same flow so that all
just has this very natural look so what
I like to do is pull where your edges
would be so if you look at your hair
where I just are I like to pluck away
from the rest of the hair for this
particular part just so that we can make
sure that everything that's in the front
so if I put any baby here if I don't
want any baby here if I pull it into a
ponytail it does look natural it does
not have this it's real thin and thick
see that all the time especially on
Instagram it's not a good look
now I had already bleached the knots on
this particular unit so with this
frontal so before I made it so I didn't
have to really worry about all that I
like to bleach my knots first because it
usually gives me a
better outlining them bleach them
because what could happen is if we try
to bleach them beforehand and you
believe okay everything is all fine and
good and well if you try to pluck it
beforehand and you think everything is
fine it's good and then you go ahead and
bleach all those knots
it could look really bad and I mean like
ball spot bad so you want to be careful
of that so once you do this and it's
like let's just say you go ahead and
plug it and then you look at it be like
oh it looks really really good okay you
know you're done but if you know you got
to go back and actually add like put
more bleach it might start looking a
little ball dish and you want it to look
natural but you don't want it to look
like you just made a full circle so if
you're dealing with alopecia or hair
loss or anything you don't want to
repeat this on something that's supposed
to make it look like you don't have that
issue if that makes any sense so as you
can see here I'm just really pulling
about three inches in the front back and
then just going through and where is no
really rhyme or reason and I'm going in
with the shum more of the straighter
ones the sharp ones and this just gonna
pluck out all of those hairs that are in
the front that are just kind of sitting
a little too thick for you I did this
unit based on my real hair line so you
have to sometimes look at your own
depending on or if is your client look
at your clients hair line and trying to
get it as close as possible so that when
you do lay it down
they don't have this very obvious
makeshift hair line and it looks fake
and it looks all minted and it looks
like they got a hair hat or that's not
the look so I do a little bit at a time
as you can see I'm doing one side and
then I'm gonna come back and do the
other side and it's just gonna give me a
guideline to see where I want to go so
you see like how it hooks around for the
side the little side piece here I'm
gonna do that on the same the exact same
side sometimes when you do bleach they
don't bleach all the knots depending on
what you do sometimes you don't leave it
on long enough it just could be a
plethora of things as to the reason as
to why so as you can see this is a side
that has nothing plugged and this is a
side with something plug and this is
literally like roughly about 15 minutes
15-20 minutes I mean just kind of going
in and seeing what I want to do so here
I'm just trying to
thin this big thick section out because
again no one's hair but Teresa's looks
like this and you can look at it
sometimes it's best if you look at it
leave it for a minute and come back
because if you do this too long like
anything else that you do for a long
period of time it's gonna start to blend
together and you're gonna I've done it
before where I've plucked it so much
that I'm like oh God
now I didn't messed it up automate a
word but I didn't mess did it you know
so here I'm just repeating that the same
thing and it good again don't get
discouraged if it doesn't work out when
you first do it because or when you
first start you're not really seeing a
difference it's better to do little by
little then it would be for you to do it
all at once and start pulling really big
chunks because what happens is you can't
put it back okay that's the thing it's
one thing when you don't take enough out
but what's this our girl is how unless
you know how to put these are these
individual hairs back into this lace
yeah it's gonna be a lot of people have
um say what do you do when you have a
frontal and you over plucked it like
what do you do
that's it always simple just buy another
one cuz that's where you went with it if
you do know how to fix it by all means
do what you got to do but for me mm-hmm
I usually at that point cuz it looks it
just looks - it's terrible it just does
make some bangs girl you know whatever
you gotta do in order to make it do what
to do because sometimes that's really
what happens and this is curling here
too so it's a little bit more on the
when it was plucked into the front so
you can tell they use way more hair than
they would for your average frontal and
as you can see I'm going between the two
because I'm like okay I want to thin out
this side the sideburn area a little bit
more just so it look it has more of a
natural feel to it so again your this is
not gonna be something that you probably
get the first shot if you do
congratulations cuz I sure nail didn't
but it's gonna take a little bit of time
but don't get too stuck boo girl it's
late it's one a class in
um don't get discouraged because you
know cumin this is something that takes
skill and it takes a while so this is
all the hair that I had went ahead and
plucked out so I'm gonna go here and
this is gonna show you how I wash my
curly hair and how to diffuse it I get a
lot of questions about this when it's
curly or wavy hair and how do I get my
hair to still looking voluminous and not
flat and not whole things also just a
side note too about back to the plucking
eye if you notice when I was plucking it
out the ends were white and I was easier
for me to pluck it out which means
though the bleach does weaken the hair a
little bit more so it's easier to pluck
out but if you do it beforehand
sometimes you can puncture your lace
because you're trying so hard to pluck
those you know tied hairs out so here
I'm just getting any of the extra hair
that I might not have grabbed when I was
plucking my frontal so what I like to do
when it comes to especially curly hair I
like to diffuse my curls because it
makes the hair look so much better and
it makes it look more natural it's not
too tight but it's also not too loose if
you do it correctly
a diffuser can be brought at any local
beauty supply whether it be the hood one
Sally's they all for the most part sell
diffusers and by the way I did cut my
West for this too so
just dealing with a little bit of
shuddhi but this is the smooth keratin
shampoo that are really perfection
shampoo that I like to use for magic
hair company this stuff works great on
straight hair but it works like miracles
on this because it sometimes what
happens is when you have curly hair and
you try to wash it it's not it and you
try to like clarify it it knots up on
you because again it's locked up and
this is like it clarifies what I need to
do but it's smooth enough where my hair
will not lock up on me so this is kind
of the equivalent to my Tresemme
conditioner but resumes shampoo is not
like the kitten I wouldn't suggest the
shampoo is just the conditioner so I'm
just gonna go through and go ahead and
define I didn't use any crud
or anything just because I wanted this
look to be as you can see in the you
know the end of the review that I'm um
that was gonna go up right after this
that I wanted it more of a natural look
I didn't want to look too done up I just
wanted to look like hey I have naturally
kind of curly hair type of thing so when
it comes down to when you are washing
curly hair always always make sure that
you are going in a single direction now
you can see how that girl here give me
you chilly realness Cherokee so as you
can see it looks very very very natural
and you just want to go in one direction
when it comes down to curly hair because
you don't want to put all this soap into
it and then start mushing it around and
a whole bunch of different directions
because it will tangle and you're gonna
be very mad cuz you're trying to get you
know whatever it is that you have either
is to just build up from any Co definer
or whatever you was using is in it is
now jacked up the hair or whatever but
you never want to like you would do your
natural hair which is at the root you
don't have any roots in this situation
so there's no need for you to be rubbing
back and forth like that because it's
going to confuse the hair is gonna
confuse the shampoo it's gonna confuse
the wig and then you're gonna have a big
confusion on your head and then you're
gonna be mad and say it was the company
was because you didn't you didn't do it
as you notice I keep going and it's one
same motion to get all of this shampoo
out I'm not digging I'm not going up I'm
not doing any of that because we're
gonna do that once we diffuse it this is
not gonna hurt the hair or mess up the
pattern of anything by doing this while
it's wet you just don't want to let it
dry it's stretched out like that because
it's gonna dry and it's gonna just
pretty much be in a very long type of
situation that's not really what we're
trying to hit right now okay so yeah
we're gonna continue to do this and as
you can see I'm just trying to make sure
I get all of the shampoo out because I'm
going to go ahead and do the conditioner
next now the conditioner is a little bit
different and you have to be careful
with lace anything so I decided to use
both of them which was the
the Tresemme conditioner I don't
remember if I showed using the same
magic hair company conditioner I'm not
really sure but I did use this for this
hair but for this particular method that
I'm about to use I use to trust me first
and what you're gonna do is you're gonna
take your unit or take your extensions
and you're going to saturate them and as
much conditioner as the hair can hold I
noticed is seeming a little excessive
but trust me at the end you'll see why
so what you want to do is you want to go
through and get through all this these
pieces that are coming out are pieces
that are cut when I put my front so I
mean when I constructed the wig so go
through and get all through all the way
through this also helps with any
shedding or any additional pieces that
you may have cut as you can see I did
and you're trying to get them out this
is what you want to do and then as you
can see the hair started to look very
very beautifully and what you want to do
is just continue to go through and make
it as saturated as you want to then what
you will you should do is go ahead and
get a plastic bag hold on I'm not ready
there's more I think this is actually
that conditioner I just didn't show it
so you want to go through and literally
like I said stop up the hair because you
want to make sure that what you're about
to do next and I just you I like to put
or with the conditioner I like to put
just a little bit of like top it in
conditioner and water too because when
you put it in the microwave because
we're that's we're about to do sometimes
I noticed that the hair gets a weird
smell when it's not all it's not cut
with water sometimes so I just tend to
do this just out of instinct so you're
gonna take your wig you're gonna put it
in the plastic bag and then we're gonna
pop it and
so you see we're gonna take this and
we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna
stop this up to as well with um
conditioner just in case there's any
parts we didn't get while you know the
hair is gonna obviously saturate that
and then with the heat it's sort of
gonna mesh very well so you just want to
make sure everything is very juicy juicy
juicy like biggie so we're gonna put it
in our microwave and we're gonna put it
in there for about hmm 1 to 2 minutes
but check it periodically because what
you don't want to do
sokka's you what you don't want to do is
put too much heat on it because your
frontal the lace on your fronts will
start to shrink and that's not what you
want to do so you want to grab this from
the very top of where your lace is and
as you can see everything is all nice
and beautiful all that good stuff and
you just want to rinse it with extremely
cold water and what this does is it
locks in all that moisture a locks in
all of the keratin all of the moisture
that came from the conditioner is going
to lock into the hair so that the hair
continues to stay like that after it's
dry it doesn't dry out so for instance
if you're in the Sun if I'm sit in the
Sun and it's just a super stupid hot day
here in LA and the Sun is beaming down
burning the F out of me my hair will be
warm but my hair will not pretty much
dry up and start to get tangled it will
be completely fine so that's why you
want to keep curly hair moisturized
because it isn't straight it doesn't
have one direction and when it doesn't
have one direction and you do not
monster eyes proper properly and
conditioned area properly with a
moisturizing conditioner not suave
people not dollar suave at least you
want to make sure that when you do run
your hands through it or you do go to
detangle it you're don't you don't cause
a big matted mess because that could
happen that's why curly here is some of
the most high-maintenance hair that you
could ever have because of that reason
so at this point I'm just gonna go
through and literally scrunch the hair
until I can't scrunch it anymore and
there's little little to no water coming
out because I want to make sure that
while I'm diffusing this the hair isn't
pulling and it's just not sitting there
like a long mop while I'm trying to
diffuse it you still wanted to have some
balance to it so doing you scrunch it
with the diffuser and you use the cool
air it dries in that state it doesn't
dry and it's super long curly wavy type
that's does not the look
and I'm only doing this to show you guys
because I literally wear this look wait
so you know and you can take a cotton
towel it's completely fine and then just
literally towel blot it to make sure
that you get as much like I said as much
of the water out as possible because you
don't want this to be a situation where
you're doing this forever so now you see
it's giving you some real chill enos
around the front and as you can see that
plucking definitely made a difference
and how natural dis looks and for right
now because there's a white mannequin
head right there you know okay was a tan
mannequin hand looks a little crazy at
some angles but when you have a nude
calf aligned and it's around your edges
it looks very very very natural
today I'm just gonna go ahead and take
my whisper-quiet
blow-dryer and my diffuser and it's such
a lie the damn thing is not even whisper
quiet it's pretty damn loud it's not as
loud as my um my golden hot one but it's
pretty loud so as you can see they sent
me it seems that they sent me like more
of a curly front soul and then sent me
more of a loose wave bundles so as you
can see they don't really blend that
well but I'll show you how to make this
make sense some of you guys would be
like I don't mind it but for me it was
very bothersome so what I did was I took
my blow dryer and I put it on cool and I
just pretty much scrunched it up so that
it could dry like such you can put it in
there you can put it around it but you
just don't want to use warm heat you
want to put this on cool because you
want this hair to dry in a very nice
cool fashion because what's gonna happen
is if you use hot or warm it's gonna
cause the hair to dry and if it's
purposely causing it to dry then all of
the moisture that is locked in there is
gonna be dried out while you blow drying
it so when you go back to use it like
wear the hair again or you have who are
you trying to detangle it all the
moisture pretty much is gonna be gone so
again it's it's just a give or take with
curly hair you just want to make sure
it's moisturized people moisturize
moisturize moisturize I can't say it any
other way I can't say it any other
direction moisturize if you don't
remember nothing else from this video
moisturize your curly and wavy hair just
to be on the safe side and you don't end
up with a big ugly matted situation so
as you can see there are a lot of the
hair is expanding and it's getting
bigger and it doesn't just kind of look
like a wet mess at this point you know
and yeah so as you can see it's starting
to look very very like I have some very
natural curly hair this is something
that came from my scalp it doesn't look
like a wig it doesn't look you know like
a frontal you want it to look is and
most people's hair that I know is curly
kind of looks like this it's not usually
one pattern and if it is one pattern
good luck to them but most people I know
have like bleached or dyed their hair so
it's not all one pattern so I will leave
you guys here for this and then you guys
check out my review for this hair to see
how I styled it and how I wore it I like
to do this method as well with just pin
the hair up and then allow it to dry
this way again you don't want it to be
dragging you want it to have some type
of bounce to it while you dry it and
such because it will stay like that so I
will catch you guys in my next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
