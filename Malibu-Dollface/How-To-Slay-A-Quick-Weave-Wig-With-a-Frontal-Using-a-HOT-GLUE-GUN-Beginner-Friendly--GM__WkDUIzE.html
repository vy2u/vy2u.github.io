um you see that I did cover it with
clear tape because I am going to use the
of course a hot glue gun and I wanted to
make sure that it does not get all on my
wig block
so these are some art mine products the
glue gun was all of three dollars and
then I think the actual glue was like
another three dollars okay so you're
just gonna pin the hair up and this is I
mean this is pretty much standard for
what um what I did in my last one which
is the how to make a live video so this
is the only part that you're gonna have
to sell which is we're gonna sew the
front tool down to the cap now this wig
block is a bit bigger than my actual
head so this week I when it was all said
and done was a little bit on the loose
side and the only reason why it was
really on the loose side for me is
because my braids were just done poorly
like cuz I did them so I don't have a
fresh fresh beehive so it's more space
than usual however I always say go a
little bit bigger than too small cut to
small gives you a headache and then you
end up you know putting attitude it
wasn't that much bigger though so I do
have another one which is a 23 inch wig
block which is pretty standard because
21 20 and 22 are pretty small um okay so
yeah just someone here same thing again
in the last video that I did which is
how to make a wig I go a more depth
about the sewing that I'm doing the
methods that I'm using but this is the
only time you grab this up with this
entire thing
you wasted time you would find what you
have
remember when you put this on like when
you put your frontal on uh in my
previous video that I just spoke about I
did pull it trim it like a whole lot
forward and for this because this wig
block is made for us like actual head
size this is just not like a general
size we're using um you can pretty much
put it on the hairline of the actual wig
block and it's gonna come out the exact
size that you want it to be you don't
have to pull it forward or anything like
that I cheated mine's a little bit more
forward just because I didn't exactly
know how this was going to fit me so
just you know trial and error purposes
um I just I mean like literally like a
couple of scoops and that was it but it
was fine um when all was said and done
it was fine I will need an adjustable
strap just to be on the safe side
even though I do gots to be glued the
front down a lot of people asked about
this lace here on the side and for me
personally I cut that once I actually
apply it and put it on you can cut the
sides which I've shown in the other
video where I'm sewing it you can cut
that off if you like but for this method
I didn't feel it was necessary because
I'm just gonna glue right over it so
whether I cut it off or it just does
nothing make a difference I promise it's
just so not gonna make a difference
okay so we're using three bundles of
body wave and the reason why I went with
this because I did buy the wave last
time and I think it's going to be a
little bit easier for you guys to
understand and see the end result so
you're gonna pin one side and you're
going to measure it once you measure it
then you're gonna go ahead and you're
gonna cut it now take your hot glue gun
I'm using a different one not the one I
showed in the package but this is the
one I still had and I've been using so
you're gonna put it and you're gonna put
it down if you take this glue and put it
all the way across the front of this
what's going to end up happening is the
glue is going to dry and then nothing is
going to stick so you have to do it
section by section so as you can see all
this little extra glue you see you it
peels right off so you're fine so take
it smooth it FYI if you are young or you
are not the smartest with using hot glue
be careful because it does get very hot
I'm not in
to burn you in my opinion but it can so
you see where you pinned it now after
everything else is glue you just go
ahead and glue that last little piece I
left a bit of a space right there
because it's really not going to matter
but I didn't want trucks too close to
where my ear tabs are going to be so you
just because you're going to cut the
rest of the cap off anyway so again
you're gonna go you're gonna cut the
ends off then you're gonna keep that pin
you're gonna put it in the back here I'm
making them a little more on the close
side because I just want to make sure
the fold that I put in this cap is going
to actually stay and then there you go
right up in there you get a little bit
of glue in the hair don't worry about it
cuz it peels right out then here
glue that piece and there you go this
wig literally took me 30 minutes I think
it actually took me 25 minutes I don't
even think of 30 but yeah make sure also
when you're doing this because this
doesn't require any type of um for you
to so besides the frontal make sure that
you do not glue your the corners of
where your tracks are too close to your
frontal because what you're going to end
up happening is you're going to end up
being like creating this barrier where
stick all the way around so keep a
little bit of distance between the
actual you can do it in the back you can
make them close in the back but in the
front don't do that so you see that
piece I just measured I put it aside
because I'm going to use it at the top
for shorter pieces so that was um bundle
one so now we run bundle two and as you
can see this took me probably like 10
minutes so again we're gonna go here so
always pin through like the last little
section of the frontal don't leave too
much space but not make sure it's as
close as possible so here as you can see
there's a big space in between these two
and I'm doing this because I'm only
using three bundles of this hair and I
want to make sure that all the hair fits
and it's even so but that's why I left
that space but you won't be able to see
and print just remember it's in the back
of your head at the very bottom unless
you are upside down and as your business
if you OH
um nobody should know that you have any
type of space back there and it's not
very noticeable but I do like to kind of
put them kind of close and then create a
space put them car clothes and then
create a space when I'm doing about
three only because what it does is it
evenly distributes the hair without it
being very very sparse at the top and
super thick in the back so here I'm
doing the same thing just pulling it
boom boom boom
hold it press it and boom there you go I
cut a little piece off because it was a
little bit longer and then I just took
this piece and I cut it and it's I don't
know what the end of this was talking
about with the left and I don't like
that so it got that again we're gonna do
the same thing so you're gonna go ahead
and pin it stick it then measure it once
you measure it cut it then once you cut
it go ahead and take your hot glue gun
and then measure it boom there you go
hold it then go grab and this is great
for when you do not have time to sew all
night you just don't have the time or
the strength and you really need to get
a wig done for either you may be a
client a family member it's an occasion
you're going to end up having to change
the wig for whatever reason or the one
you had wasn't working out this is great
you just need a spare hour and um slope
just a little bit off um these are art
roles um hot glue guns are great the
only thing that I don't like about these
is opposed to my other one which I did
buy remember when you guys buy these hot
glue guns make sure you guys buy the
right size because there's a whole bunch
and especially I got mine from Michaels
and at Michaels they have so many
different sizes I bought the wrong size
for the gun I brought which actually
doesn't it has like a clip in the back
so it keeps pressing the stick until
it's completely done these have you have
to put the next one in when it gets to a
certain point and start pushing it which
actually helps push the glue out for the
one in the front so that's the only
thing so that's why you probably notice
that I'm kind of pushing my body towards
the back of the gun because I'm trying
to make it
oh but for $3 you can't really beat that
um so damn boom cut make sure and then
imma go ahead and steal this side up and
I notice that why while I was doing this
I was watching loving hip-hop so our
minds got a little crooked so just to
you know even I don't know I just made
it a little higher on one side and cut
it and then they're gonna meet on this
side so bones just took it hold it just
remember do not put it through the hole
wept because you're gonna end up having
a pill it off and then you're gonna be a
little mad at yourself which sucks so I
don't I think I started this wig at like
955 and as you can see on the services
1032 so I'm making great time I was able
to finish this within an episode which
is impossible usually when I'm sewing
and you don't have to do this all the
time but as of recently because just
time restraints and I just don't have
time to you know show a wig all the time
I'll do it every now and then but for
the most part this has been my source
and it works the only thing is when you
wash your wigs make sure you wash them
like two inches from the root down try
not to get water on this because water
pretty much will help you pull off I've
watched for wigs and had every intention
of redoing them and then sometimes I
have to really pull to get it off but if
you just are one of those people who you
weren't curly hair or something like
that just make sure to not try to get as
much water product fine water not so
much on um on the top and you should be
fine and this is the best you know we
quickly I don't like to use naty's blue
with this because it does not stick as
well it takes forever to dry this is a
very quick method it gets straight to
the point and a great thing about it is
it does not ruin your hair but it Loki
Loki actually sells your weft
No
waiting for me got a fortune and this
was the piece that I actually I showed
you guys earlier that I didn't use it
because it was too short
well no pieces were not used for this
particular wig so go ahead and stick
that down measure it cut that off run
the glue through real quick run the
backside real quick and boom and we were
done in less than a twenty five about
twenty five minutes about 20-25 minutes
so then oh I got to do the the last
little tip of it and boom any extra glue
that you see just pull it and it'll come
off so here I'm just gonna take
everything out of it um and boom there
you go you got your nice body wave
everybody's food and then what I do to
pretty much take this off is I peel like
remember to take these remember we put
these in the beginning these pins
remember to take them out and don't glue
over them because they're gonna be bad
so I'll pull your lace front wheel back
and then pull it off and boom kill cut
the inside out so a lot of people are
confused you're just cutting the extra
piece that's up under your frontal
because you want to put a nude cap on so
you don't want it to look black on the
scalp so you just cut that little piece
out and then BAM you've got a brand new
wig with not too much effort so as you
can see put it back on pardonez gray
baby here is great this was pre plucked
so I'm gonna put it on just a guy show
you guys and boom it looks so good and
then the ear tabs are popping and one
thing I do is got to be gluing it down
here is a close-up of what it looks like
it's super flat as you can see and these
little like I bleached the frontal when
I got it but just sometimes I don't it
don't always bleach out I'm gonna leave
it on too long because I don't want to
get brassy I just peel amine pills
um pluck some of the hairs out the front
and sometimes when I do bleach my baby
hairs will get a little bit on the
on side and I don't necessarily like to
just bleach over them because it looks
as you can see a little more natural
when you put it on because some people's
edges are a little bit more on the blond
side then they get black so you just put
plug some of them out not all of them
but some of them and there you go hope
you guys enjoy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
