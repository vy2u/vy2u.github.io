little loop so I went ahead in of course
made the wig that's fine and I parted
the hair in and the direct and middle
first because when you I did wear this
in the side part but you want to do it
evenly on both sides because what you
don't want to do unless you can you plan
to keep it in a specific side part
you're going to be stuck with some very
uneven color since this is more of an
ombre look so what I like to do when I'm
very lazy which is usually all the time
I like to go ahead and just sporadic we
put this in Nice such nice high sections
and I run the color through it I only do
this when I'm doing more of a color
that's going to be on a darker side if
it's going to be lighter in the final
results I like to go ahead and simply
just take it and try to try to make the
best like the best of it but since this
is going to be on a darker side it
really don't matter how this is going to
look because it is going to look more of
an ombre colors going to go from black
select this very Birkin like lightish
burgundy color so all I'm doing here
after I mix the bleach which I've shown
in other videos on how I'm it hard like
this consistency of bleach that I like
I'll go ahead and just put it together
and then here just running through I
didn't do anything to this hair but go
wash it before I started doing this
Annika washed it before actually I co
wash it after I bleached enough on the
frontal so I just did all that at one
time I would let it air dry and then I
installed it so this is the natural
texture of it before I went ahead and
did any of that
so here at the top as you can see I am
getting a little bit I just got I like
to go around once and then let it do
like a light lifting and then I'll go
back a little bit more and then get some
bigger chunks so that way everything is
heaving all the way around but it has
levels to it so it's a bit lighter in
some areas and darker in other areas and
what this does just want you to post
your color it gives you an automatically
natural um
light and under psych a lighter tone and
then of course darker tones and it will
have these different dimensions and
everything is just not really flat but
this is the very rush but effective way
he could do something so this is the
hair all done this is the color came
once I went ahead and rinsed it I used
the L'Oreal Burgundy and I use one
Laurie oh it's me not Laurie I'm sorry
Revlon burgundy and then I went ahead
and used a Revlon it was like a dark
burgundy because they had I ran out of
color so I was like okay whatever is all
Burgundy it should be fine and normally
I would use like a door but I was
nowhere close to LA at this point so it
really didn't matter so as you can see
the color is not as even as I would have
done had this been like the solid color
or would have left it a lighter color
because obviously you don't want it to
look blotchy but because this is a
darker color like I said once before
it's not gonna you're not going to be
able to tell the difference I mean at
all whether you're straight or as curly
you just will not be able to tell so
that's pretty much what this is I like
this color sit for about
once about a day and a half as you guys
are new here I like to let my color sit
for quite some time because I wanted to
be able to take and make sure that it's
very even and make sure that it is very
saturated and sometimes if you because
after a while I just simply stopped
working after about 45 minutes depending
on what the direction say it will stop
working so if that's the situation you
don't don't worry about it over
processing but what it does do is that
when it does dry it will start to stain
the hair itself as just a product and
that's what I like so it makes sure that
my hair when I do rinse it or I do wash
it it doesn't fade as quick so this is
just me pretty much going over all of
the hair and I literally took us a
completely separate bottle and drench
the entire head of this to make sure
that it came out exactly like I needed
it and wanted it to so this is what it
looked like at the end of it as you can
see and then once I rinsed it and
blow-dried it it was this color so this
is the cutting portion of it so what
we're going to do is I'm pulling
everything up in the front that's going
to be like the bang part and cutting it
at an angle just so that everything all
the bang in the front is cool I'm
cutting the ends just because this hair
has not bad dead ends but it was quite a
few so as you guys can see the color
came out beautifully and this is if you
ever just want some layers on the side
pull your hair directly out and cut it
very slowly but surely you want to cut I
like to cut my hair when our color like
this and our section as like three
layers so I like to cut it at the top
layer the middle layer and then the very
bottom layer so as you can see here I'm
just taking it and I'm cutting these
layers and I'm really digging in here to
make sure that when I do curl it it does
give a nice curl to it but I'm not
trying to chop it all the way this was
not chopped nearly as much as my other
one I was a little bit lighter on this
one just because it was going to be
heavier at the bottom as it
to the top but I did have to get a lot
of it I cut a lot of hair oh and here's
just I'm checking to see how it's going
to be once I curl it you know away from
my face this is what I'm trying to check
for to make sure that everything is
going to lay like it's supposed to so as
you can see it's starting to shape up so
this is what I like to do put it the
first layer that I cut behind and then
cut just a little bit below and then do
that so this is not keep checking to
make sure that everything is going to
look right when I curl it so it may be a
little confusing I'll have a more
in-depth video that's just specifically
on the cutting process but I just wanted
to kind of share this part because a lot
of people were asking like oh can you
please tell me how you got this look and
it's very easy to do you just have to
practice at it and then once you kind of
get used to it it's fine so this is what
it looks like after the fact so I'm just
going to start curling this is pretty
self-explanatory I'm going to curl
everything that's going to be on the
sides of my head downward and then
that's what at the very top we're going
to curl downwards on the sides we're
going to curl backwards and at the very
back we're going to curl downwards so
the sides are back and then the top in
the back is away and this is just going
to guarantee that when I let you scroll
set and cool that when I brush it out
that it's going to have this nice bouncy
feel to it so and then also because of
how you cut it will also determine how
your hair is going to look on all of it
and done you want like a nice wavy look
but you also want to bouncy where you
look not really a flat look and here
I didn't put as much value like I did
the previous look I did to this where
was really really tall and voluminous at
the top I wanted to problem to be like
that and I want to just to be a little
more relaxed so when I did push it away
from my face you could tell that it was
more relaxed at the top so you see here
at the top I did it downward and then on
the side I did it away from my face as
you can see this I'm doing this away
from my face as well so that these two
particular parts when you brush it out
they connect and make this one beautiful
curl
just on the side and it's away from my
face so I don't have to worry about I
could put it behind my ear or anything
like that
so cutting and curling directions make a
big difference in how the curls are
going to leg once you brush them out if
you decide to brush the knot so that I
like this looks like Angela Bassett hair
and played into excel when she went off
and she was curling her hair so once the
front is done the back you could
literally do this like the day of you
don't have to really necessarily crow
this if you don't want to but if you
want everything to just be very beauty
clean go ahead but for the sake of this
video I'm just going to go ahead and do
it I made these much bigger in the back
as I did in a month you know rather than
what I did in the front the front was
very like section off the back I just
grabbed as many big sections as I could
just because of the fact that I knew for
effective precise we're going to be very
voluminous I don't really want to look
like I have a helmet on or look like a
Stepford wife because it could very
indie have the kind of way for them to
drop so I wasn't trying to do that so
this is what it looks like when I'm done
as we see in the back I did I'm very big
in the front this is what you want it to
be very section or sectioned off I use
this to make sure I have some saw some
shine and some flexibility to it and
then I went ahead and use my hairspray
to make sure that it held and then I let
these sit for about it mm-hmm I want to
say for about a day and some change
because right after how did this I wore
this look to something I don't remember
what it was it was before my birthday I
know that much and I wore this looks and
then this is what I got so you see what
I mean like all the curls on the side
stay and it gives you this really bouncy
voluminous look without it looking too
thick at the top I don't want my hair to
be if you see how the bottoms are I
don't want the top to look that way so I
hope this helped you guys and I will
catch you guys in my next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
