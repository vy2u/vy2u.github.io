had the same those two caps that are the
same I've used those before but this
newer one I have never used before and
it looked like it would you know it
would be a good candidate and coming to
find out it was actually very perfect so
I usually use these styrofoam hits to do
my wigs on I need a wig block but I just
haven't got around to doing it because I
just been lazy
um they heard that I'm using is the
Brazilian deep curly from princess hair
shop I have 220 60s and 228 and I have I
think a 20 inch a deep curly closure
from closure store what I was gonna do
initially is I was going to start the
hair and then put the closure on
afterwards but I decided to do that I
said let me just go ahead and put the
closure on beforehand I like to double
the bags and single the tops and what I
mean by that is to make the hair fit and
be thicker towards the end and not bulky
at the top you want to fold them like
this and then you sew the where it folds
together so that it does not slip while
you're sewing but it also lays flat when
you sew it down you can do this sort of
for a weave you can do this for you part
you can do this whenever you need the
hair to either fit or you just trying to
UM save space this would actually be
very perfect I knew this hair was going
to be big so I was like I don't know how
big it's gonna be once I brush it out
but I do want to make sure that it's not
too full towards the top and it starts
to look kind of waking so here I just
decided that I wanted to go ahead and
put my closure on because this will make
the most sense to do it first sometimes
I work backwards you guys this is just
my life um I'm probably looking for some
thread but I'm actually using the big
jumbo needles to do this and I'm using
the nylon thread because again cotton
just seems to snap and it also likes to
get very very tangled in
that we don't want to do this so what
you're going to do is you're going to
place even if you're going to have a
side part I would always suggest that
you start you solder closure in the
middle of the head because this is just
going to ensure that everything is
thinner if you do it offset it can work
but yeah I've seen people do that and it
just looks like it was supposed to have
been something else so here I'm just
doing the simple loop and pull anybody
can do this there are other people who
have techniques on how they secure their
webs secure their sewing I'm sorry it
but and I know how to do those methods
as well because this wig is just for me
I don't really feel the need to be so
meticulous about it or neat about it
because it's just going on my head I
could care less how it looks as long as
it's flat and it's laid so um you guys
are going to see me struggle with this
closure because when closures are thick
like this in like around the perimeter
which you need that band because it it
just prolongs the life of your closure
for forever the ones who don't have it
they tend to get stretched out and
sometimes they tear so that thick band
um is great some stylists will cut it
down a little bit I tend to just leave
it and I just leave just sort of track
around that to cover it and it always
works for me but the thing about
closures is sometimes we do sew one side
down you get to the other side it
doesn't want to lay flat so I learned
that if you saw one side pull the other
side slow it down and then sew the back
everything will be flat otherwise you're
gonna have a nice little fold which is
not attractive if it's supposed to be
mimicked in a scalp why does your scalp
have a fold in it you know
my message at the beep tell me open when
they baby
me so why don't you make up your mind
as you guys can see here I was very
careless with my sewing I just didn't
care I was on the phone it was hot this
light was burning my face down I was
over it disclosure was acting stupid so
yeah that's pretty much the life of
doing hair sometimes things just don't
want to accurate when you want them to
but yeah this is pretty much the gist of
it
um I people always ask me so what do you
suggest lace or silk always so silk
always looks more natural than lace
nobody has holes in their scalp so you
know if it's a preference cool if it's
not you know definitely give them a try
because they're very very
natural-looking especially if they're
installed correctly
so usually I'll use stick pins but
clearly I didn't have any so this was
the first think this is the first bundle
yeah this is the first bundle this was
the second bundle put in and as you can
see it's starting to get fuller in some
more life
this was the third bundle as you can see
towards the top I'm getting I'm putting
more space in between versus what I was
doing at the bottom and this is ensure
that it's going to lay flat this was
almost the last bundle and then you see
how full it is at the bottom and then
this was the last bundle put in with the
closure and to close it up I just pretty
much took a tract and sold it right
around that band that's on the closure
so as you can see everything is hidden
because the hair is so big and this is
me being stupid
okay so I just wanted to give like a
demonstration of what I mean because I
didn't record everything on my tutorial
because it's hard to record without me
being in the frame so I want to give you
guys an example of what I mean about the
closure this is a closure from closure
store that I haven't used yet I'm
actually going to use this for some
other hair but I just want to get you
guys an example this is what it looks
like when you first get it this is the
back this is the band that I was
speaking of that you used to these bands
will help your closures last longer so
that you can pull them and they don't
rip every closure does not come with one
of these but they're good to have some
people like to cut them down so they
won't be in the way the only thing that
I do is when I get to the top of the cap
I just take up either a depends on how
thick a website but I'll take either one
or two webs and then we'll go ahead and
sew those around the perimeter of this
to hide that but most of the time you
can't see it because I make sure my hair
is laid so like this hair I left the cap
I mean I left the band on the cap but
you can't see it because of all this
hair that's hiding it
is usually what the silk base will look
like again for those who are not
familiar with the base or you guys are
just trying to try it out make sure that
your silk base closures are not great
because that nobody's scalp is gray it's
light brown or a taupe or an opaque
color but it should never be gray you
know like this hair is so silky it's not
even funny so this is what the silk on a
silk base closure should look like so
this is what the scalp of a silk based
closure should look like it should look
very realistic for those who have a
darker scalp
I know locations ninety nine has a video
about how to dye the silk on this on
your silk base closure if they're too
light to dye them with tea and they'll
darken it up a little bit well depending
on how long you leave it in there
but she has a full-blown tutorial on how
to do so my scalp is very light so these
work great for me so if you are brown
skin light skin in between any of that
or you just got a really white scalp who
actually work Emily when I make wigs um
I use a I was using like a regular man's
dome cap and now companies are kind of
catching on that everybody's making
their own leagues so I brought a couple
of these I used this particular cap when
I did my you ever want to have the red
hair with the dark roots not the wig but
it was actually what it was from virgin
virgin hair obsession when I had the
nice pretty red hair but it had the
darker roots I use this cap on that and
it worked the problem with these caps I
find is that they don't have a size it
says one size fits all which is not the
truth because this one has a little
stretch to it but it's not they don't
stretch enough cap that I'm currently
rocking is this one and this is the
first time that I've actually seen this
cap so I decided to get it so this is my
new go-to so I'll show you guys what the
front looks like it's to make your own
wig and this has the it says with
breathable mesh
Sadam style cap but it has breathable
mix breathable mesh texture um for you
part wigs and faux legs so you I would
suggest these to anyone when you're
putting these on and I'm sure I
mentioned this in my tutorial I used to
cut the band of the of the actual cap
off so I kept running into the issue
like this part I would cut off I would
sell my tracks all the way through up in
here and I will cut this off this time I
did not do that I saw the tracks I
started my double tracks on here so four
bundles were able to fit I mean two
bundles were able to fit on this and
then the rest of these were our single
bundles so I'm sure I mentioned it but
again when you are doing especially
straight hair and you want to get a lot
of bundles onto one cap what you do is
you double the backs and you single the
top so from here to here should only be
should be where you want to double them
to make them fit and then by time you
get to the top depending on how many
bundles you have rather be one more
bundle or two then it should be um just
the single tracks and the single tracks
will allow your hair to lay flatter at
the top of be still be fuller at the
bottom so then when you swing it it has
weight at the bottom but it's not bulky
at the top if that makes any sense um so
yeah I hope this tutorial was in depth
enough I did not show all of the sewing
because it's pretty self-explanatory if
you know how to soul weave if you know
how to sew pretty much anything you
should be able to do so I don't have a
special technique I do the loop and pull
because all the extra stuff that I think
people do is great for them but yeah
it's not really for me you know
um so people keep asking me and I keep
getting and I keep having to say this on
Instagram
I don't provide wigs and I don't make
wigs for people the reason why I won't
do it is because it's very
time-consuming if I have for clients I
need their hair done by next week that
means I will not leave the house for
four days because I'm so gung-ho or
trying to get their hair and do this and
do this and do this and do that
so we tween hair reviews regular life
getting ready to move I just don't have
it in my schedule to make wigs for other
people I highly like making my own so um
there are people that I know who make
great wigs that I would refer you guys
to the first person and I think you guys
should be familiar with is Tokyo styles
yeah he does great wigs um I'll put his
Instagram and all his information below
you can contact him if you're looking to
get a unit made as well as hair by
Raymond Raymond actually does a lot of
the girls um that I know on YouTube some
of their units he's done um you know
just to change it up a little bit they
went to him and I've seen not one
problem or issue with any of his wigs he
makes beautiful units and the other
person is this Latoya but her name is so
effing vain on Instagram she also makes
units um so I'll put all of their
information below if you guys are
looking to get a unit made I'm there for
me with all of them we follow each other
back and forth one Instagram so I would
never refer you to somebody who I think
this shabby work and I'm sure there's
other people out here who you know
provide those services as well but those
are the people that came to me off of
top because I know that the work is
really good so um again I hope this
helped I hope you guys loved this and I
will catch you guys in the next one
peace and what do you guys want to see
next I don't know I mean like what
tutorial do you want to see next because
this was actually fun so let me know
alright guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
