a little lengthy but yeah so I did I
like an unboxing of it but I have no
clue where that footage is so we're
gonna start from here we're gonna start
off by taking out this comb because this
is where your parts gonna go so you just
don't want a comb where like it's just
gonna look stupid so you don't want to
do that because it's super duper
unnecessary and then after this you take
it out you want to be careful with this
because you don't want to pull in tear
your lace as you can see I tore mine's
just a little bit but it's fine but the
more accurate you are with this accurate
that is not a word accurate you are with
this then the easier it will be so now
that that's all you see this a little
bit but nothing crazy I went ahead and
bleach the knots on this unit they do
not want a bleach but you'll see in my
installation video what I went ahead and
did with this so from here what I'm
gonna do is I went ahead and washed it
and I'm gonna go ahead and give put the
part where I want it to be because of
course we want a nice deep side part
that's hot Tiana's hair was and I will
be using my original version that I did
as a reference and for that version I
use the photos of her so this makes it
much easier so we're gonna go ahead and
part and then once we finish part and
we're gonna go ahead and put it into
sections to start the cutting process
this is a fourteen inch full lace unit
with a searchable cap panel in the back
I'll put the link for this exact wig
from a wig encounters below now I did
notice something with this wig is that
when I did the exact same thing I did
with the other one my part is gonna
change a few times so keep that in mind
but I did the same thing but you could
see the cap on this one a little bit
more than you could on the other one so
I'm assuming that the cap construction
isn't exactly the same because they were
not exactly the same so this is the side
piece where you're this is the part
that's going to go behind your ear so
you want to part this a little fur
the back then you would just because you
want to make sure that the whole section
back there is part it so that you can
put a lot of layers on the side where it
will lay flush to your head so this is
the back section and this is where all
of the well this is would be this like
the second section this is where all the
layers would be within the back of the
nape all the way up to the crown of the
head and this is the bang piece that
will go right here in the front so you
should end up with three sections
just like this parted off to make sure
that you're not going to accidentally
cut so we're gonna pretty much cut it
all the same but yeah so dude we're
gonna start here with the size so that's
the one that I wore and reviewed in the
back and this is the one that I'm gonna
cut now so what you're gonna do is
you're gonna pull the hair away from the
actual head like such and you're gonna
cut the thing that you want to remember
with cutting is that when you cut away
from your head and then it falls it
makes a tapered look towards the bottom
if you cut straight down and across it's
gonna be blunt so when you cut like such
and then you go ahead and let this hair
fall it's gonna give that nice tapered
look at the bottom of the hair as you
can see on the other on the other wig
now in this video I could not find my
really good shears so these are some
really bad dole shears that I had
sitting around and then at one point
y'all gonna see me use like some really
just a regular paper scissors just
because I just couldn't for the life of
me remember what the hell my shears were
and I wasn't trying to leave until I was
done so this is the only section you
should be doing this with and this is to
create this back piece you're gonna use
this as a guideline you're gonna use
this for a guideline for the back part
so that it all kind of you'll see once
we get there so you're just pulling out
and you're cutting now this is the
length of this I'm going little by
little because normally I would have cut
way more off because I'm used to doing
this but you gotta remember that if you
cut too much off you can't put it back
but if you cut a little bit and you just
you know you keep trying it on and make
sure and it's gonna vary depending on
whose head it is because some people's
foreheads and faces are longer so
sometimes you might want to leave it a
little bit longer depending on the style
the desires
so for the bottom section here what
you're gonna do is you're gonna go ahead
and you're gonna pull this out like I
said to do earlier you're gonna pull it
out and you're gonna cut it we're gonna
make the bottom portion of this so where
that's part it shorter in the top of
this longer so that you have a like
think of a seven just think of the
letter set I mean the letter seven oh
grow the number seven and how it looks
it's longer it darts out at the top and
then it comes down at the bottom so
that's the shape that you pretty much
want to do with this now I'm doing it a
smaller section just because I want to
make sure that I don't end up with two
slay they're not you're just too short
and listen you can always get scissor
happy believing that you got it and you
killing it and then you look at it and
it's too short so what do you do you
know to have to add tracks to a full
lace wig defeats the entire person
purpose this could have just been a
frontal so to avoid that and as you can
see I'm struggling with these really
dull scissors shears excuse me
I don't got enough Beauty to go girl so
yeah I'm just going through just making
it a general shape I'm only cutting off
probably about two and a half inches of
hair at the most you know not very much
I like personally to do this while the
hair is wet for the initial cut because
it's easier to put the hair in the
direction that I would like it in and
then you'll see we're gonna round brush
it and do that whole thing so just take
your time because that way everything
which is it's gonna make a lot more
sense if you take your time with it
sometimes if it's gonna take you a
couple of days to do it take your time
because again buying a wig
then wasting the money by jacking it up
is not very smart if you're looking to
try this for the first time I would
suggest doing this on a synthetic wig
gives you the same situation you know
it's the same thing all those synthetic
wigs don't really lay like this one at
weight or if you just have a wig laying
down all just laying around and do it as
you can see this is when I transition to
the paper scissors because those dull
ones was just not worked and it did the
job when I go ahead
in text rate and all that I won't be
using this but for the initial cut I
just couldn't take it no more so of
course it's not really what you have is
how you use it I've done full cuts with
these type of scissors I don't suggest
it on real hair because they're terrible
for your ends and it will give you the
worst split ends ever but you know the
proper tools always work but sometimes
when in China mmm When in Rome girls so
going through and we're just cutting it
a little bit more and more and as you
can see as I'm going down it's starting
to get longer at the top and the back is
more of a tapered look because once we
go ahead and start to bump it and curl
it you'll see why this was done now I
don't know what it is about this cap but
it seems like the cap was put on crooked
and then as you can see like that line
it seemed like it was put on crooked so
that's why you can start to see in my
part later on you'll notice you can see
it a little bit which is fine you just
take some concealer and call it a day so
in this section this will be the banging
part which is coming down over the eyes
so when you go ahead and cut straight up
and straight across you're gonna end up
with a the same thing which is this you
see it's blunt there but when you let it
go it's gonna have this nice tapered
swoop bang feel within at the top now
for me I'm cutting this based on what I
see because this it fits my head for
someone else it may be a little bit
shorter sometimes it may be a little bit
longer and always make sure you put I
like to call it fake body in it so when
you do round brush it or you bump it you
know where it's gonna lay because
sometimes if you cut it to the exact
length and you try to bump it it's gonna
be so she's gonna let me be moon Beyonce
levy cutter brings with those paper
scissors like that so here I'm just
pulling it straight out and I'm cutting
so that it could just go ahead and lay
and I'm just giving myself a guideline
to understand that where is it gonna be
short where is it gonna be longer so
then when I do go in and round brush it
and it is longer I can see what needs to
be shorter and what needs to be longer
again this is one of those things that
takes time and after a while you're
start to understand
very easy to do and I'm trying to keep
this as in layman's terms it's easy
because over directed under directed off
based on base that confuses people and
it kind of discourages people so we
gonna just say pull this straight out to
your chest and cut it okay that's what
we're doing so that would be the side
section in some of the bangs but not
really that's really just most of the
side section this section at the top is
the Bank section so I'm just going
through and I'm cutting all of the Bank
section that I sectioned off in the
beginning I'm just cutting it all to one
length so that it feels you know like
okay we're getting somewhere the hair is
getting shorter but it doesn't look
butchered that's that's pretty much what
you want if at this point things are
starting to look a little bit on the
auto nose side resection off everything
and then not necessarily start over but
just reevaluate the whole look that
you're doing does all your three
sections have a section it's some pieces
longer than others so if the back is
longer then the sides you know that's
good if it's shorter than the sides you
got a problem so as you can see now as
I'm gonna blend these into each other
and this is the easiest way starting out
to do this is to understand to work in
sections some people if you are you know
watch professional hairstylist they
don't work in sections because they're
used to it they know what they're doing
and this is something that they do every
day but if you're a person who doesn't
know what you're doing every day
sections will save your life and it will
save your wig and it would save the
hairstyle and always go longer and then
go shorter once you actually put it on
your head this is still a wig block so
again there is no eyeline or whatever
I'm using another wig as my pretty much
my guide so at this point we just have a
short wig with a little bit of layering
in it and that's about it so we feel
like we really did nothing with eczema
off and you think why you just didn't
cut it all even around that's because
you just doesn't that's not the look so
as you can see here it's like goes
straight from this like regular lace and
then the actual cap starts to come in
but I didn't have that issue on this
other one and they're the exact same wig
because they sit me the same exactly I
don't know if the cap construction like
I said was either crooked
or what it was but that was interesting
so on this thought I was looking to see
if I got the same feel like does it do
this on this side too and it did so as
you can see there is a lot of body in it
now some I can see that it's gonna sit
up like I wanted to the part is still
horrendous to me I don't like it at all
but we'll fix it as time goes by so at
this point you're gonna take your blow
dryer I had just round brushed some gray
hair that I'm doing so excuse my brush
but just gonna go ahead and you're gonna
round brush this wherever you see where
there should be a curve should be which
would be at the end of this entire look
all of this look has a bump in it that's
what you want to do so you take this and
you go ahead and bump it at this point I
was just really trying to give it a
shape I wasn't trying really going for
the whole like neat look because I know
I have more cutting to do so it really
just didn't serve much of a purpose
because this part right here in the
front there are three sections that
you're going to want to like bump this
in so as you can see this front section
I'm gonna go this is gonna go towards my
face so the brush should be rolled like
a roller towards your forehead the side
part as you can see this middle part
right here this is gonna go down and
then this back part is gonna go out so
there are three sections in this this
Bank area there's the very beginning the
middle and the bag so don't forget that
because if you try to do this I I'm
telling you you do this part wrong it's
gonna easily turn into somebody's
aunties it's gonna really be the auntie
style I'm just saying you know you don't
something you want the reason why this
is so edgy cuz it's split up and it
looks more effortless and more chic
don't worry about the ends of this being
curly because we're gonna handle that in
a second but all you want to do is give
yourself you see that body in that root
area that's what you want to keep that's
what you want so after a while you
should probably end up with the nice
little school pictures get down popping
off like I could put a barrette missing
and send somebody on their way so I'm
just go ahead and I'm just round
brushing this whole section to make sure
that it has a nice hard bump in it
because I am gonna go through after
and change so you can see all those
layers that we cut are now starting to
pop up all of it is stout now starting
to look like a style starting more
resemble what we're going for
and when here's what this it tends to do
that you just don't know what the hell
it's looking like just saying but I want
to thank fabrics for actually sending me
another one of these wigs to to actually
try this on because again I wanted to
show you guys this and it was my first
time in a long time doing a cut like
this so I didn't want to record it
because I know how frustrating it is to
record you don't know when you're trying
to do something this all of this stuff
that I'm doing right now takes a lot of
work to put the lights and the camera
make sure everything is angle writing
it's in focus for a simple haircut now
as you can see we starting to get some
good old Schmoke guard I mean that I
only submitting that good old bump up in
there and again it doesn't have to be
perfect but it needs to just have some
type of body in it so I can kind of see
how everything is laying and what we're
gonna go with it
so at this point you should have pretty
much short on the side the back should
be longer and your bangs should have a
hell of a bump in it that's where we
should be it again don't worry about the
part because we're gonna go ahead do a
little makeup trick with that that's the
only thing I didn't like about this unit
and I kind of struggle with on my other
one is that the knots didn't they were
very frustrating to bleach so you're
gonna take your pressing calm you guys
know I've been doing this on my channel
for years and we're gonna just go in too
late this side this is the side it's
gonna go flesh up on your the side of
your face so you want this to look as
flat as possible and again this is
you're gonna cut this lace off so you
want it to look like as if it's coming
from your scalp you do a little bit of
edge control and or hairspray on it and
you just went ahead and you know slicked
it behind your ear so you want to make
this side as flat as you can and then
for the roots of this part we still want
that bump in it but I wanted to kind of
go up and then drop because we're gonna
we're gonna straighten those roots so we
don't want it to just be like a full
curl you know so we're gonna loosen this
up just a little bit but not a lot and
it's gonna start to give you this look
which is more of a bump in the feel to
it so once you do that you want to take
your flat iron and you're only gonna go
to the roots I mean no to the ends and
you're just gonna bust one of those and
as time goes on as the one in the
background it'll start to just lay like
that naturally but that bump at the top
with the help of a little bit of
hairspray will keep that you know those
roots very much voluminous like that
it's just the easiest way to do it
without trying all of the over directing
and pin curling and the whole thing
because sometimes people get scared when
you Pinker or something and you take it
out and you brush it out and you'd be
like why's it so tight they don't know
how to so this is an easier method to do
so here you're just gonna go and as you
start to see it's starting to have that
shape of the other one it's starting to
look more like this one now so I'm gonna
re part this part like eight more times
because it was killing my whole soul
people so what we're gonna do now is
because the bank is obviously still too
long we're
do that same method we're gonna go back
and I tried it on at this point to see
like where everything was but I still
knew that it was too damn long so when I
go up we're gonna cut right across so
that's why I'm trying to get everything
up we're gonna go and cut straight
across and as you do this it already has
that bump in it because that we already
did it it starts to lay like that very
naturally so it's not a very hard thing
to do anything that you pull straight up
and you cut straight across will
automatically have a taper look to it
when you let it drop especially when you
put somebody in so now it looks like
that still too long but I want to show
you if you at this point now we'd be
rocking and rolling you and the you and
a good place right now okay so what you
want to do now is go ahead and that's
all I'm doing here is just cutting a
little bit more a little bit more and a
little bit more and a little bit more
just so that it starts to look more and
more like it's supposed to you know now
the back section here is the little
piece that goes in the back where it
looks like I kind of got a bump so it's
just weird we're back at the seven part
okay we're back at seven part so we're
doing the top part of the seven and then
we're doing the lower part so you said
these are just blunt we're gonna go
ahead and pull this straight out so I
can have more of a taper look like the
back of this head does because all it is
as you can see it's all kind of just one
length and I'm going back just to check
everything to make sure everything is
cool and what I like to do when I cut is
to move it in the opposite direction it
lays because it'll let me know how those
layers are gonna look once I bump it in
the back and that's all I did you kick
round brush this in the back if you want
to you could take the same part and do
it while it's wet but I chose to not do
it like that because it's harder to see
for you guys so for all of you guys who
are starting out you just want to keep
going through and cutting checking and
cut and checking and cutting and
checking and that's all you're doing at
this point is checking and cutting to
make sure that the shape is still right
but you're getting short enough where
it's the desired look you don't
necessarily have to do it as short as I
did it you could keep it where it was in
the beginning and Flatiron it and then
keep it pushing you know I like to use
these pins because they kind of give me
the section of an ear you know it shows
you like okay this is where the ear will
go I have longer ones I don't know the
hell yet though so here is the piece
that goes behind my ear so you see it's
a little too long there we're just gonna
go up and cut it some more
and then as you can see here I just keep
looking at this other one I'll put some
photos at the bottom that you guys can
look at as a reference if you like too
I'll link some Tiana's pictures as well
at the bottom so you can use those as a
reference and it's at this point you
should already now kind of get to what's
going on so go back and that's what I'm
doing I'm just going back and cutting
off more and more and more so that I can
get the shape that I want and at this
point you're just going for the shape
that's it and then you're gonna start to
bump it some people will bump it first
and then go and start cutting more so
they can see it cuz sometimes it makes
it easier for them it just depends on
the person
you just don't again I cannot stress
this enough do not cut a whole bunch off
or you're gonna be so mad at yourself so
what i'm doing here is i'm taking some
thinning shears and i'm thinning out the
hair again these wigs are very full
that's why I like I opted to use this
particular wig and this company because
their density is really good and you
just want to thin out especially not so
much the roots but more so just the ends
because you wanted to have this nice
tapered feathery look at the ends and
you really it's hard to achieve that
when the hair is exact it's just too
full and because this is a very short
cut you don't want to end up in a
situation where you out here literally
like you know you looking crazy so here
I just went through and I just bumped it
and kind of call Indians ran my fingers
through it and kind of let it fall
naturally so you see it's shorter this
is one where we cut we cut the other
side short we did the front bank piece
and then we did the back and there you
go you should have something like this
so my next video is gonna be me applying
it with the both hold tape and the
little extra stuff so there you go hope
you guys enjoyed it I'll catch you guys
in my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
