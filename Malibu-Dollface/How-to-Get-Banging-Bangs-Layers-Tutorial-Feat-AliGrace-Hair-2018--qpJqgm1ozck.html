gonna start cutting um you want to see
how I make wigs I'll put a link down
below so you're gonna I kind of gauge
this cuz I had marked my my head where
my eyes would be and how wide I want
them the wider your bangs are the wider
you cut them the water they'll sit on
your face so if you want them to go like
2d like my marriage a blush look where
I'll stick somewhere up in here like
that and you wanted to go all the way
around you would obviously cut these
much wider you want them a little more
of a Chinese blac chyna bang then you
obviously will bring them much more in
these I'm just doing pretty much basic
there Derrick not too close in but
they're also not too wide neither so
what you're gonna do is you're gonna
this is what it looks like Owen as you
guys can see we're gonna go ahead and
take the flat iron and we're gonna bump
this first before we cut it and here's
why when you bump your hair it makes
your hair shorter so if you cut too much
obviously this is too much but if you
cut too much then you're gonna kind of
see that and it's gonna look weird I've
seen it all over Instagram where girls
bangs be super duper like a but I don't
like bangs that are above their eyebrow
I've seen other people do it and it's
cute on them but because I have much of
a wider face and a stronger jawline I
that's not a look it looks like I didn't
know what I was doing so that's what
we're doing here and this is a like a
foolproof way to make sure that your
bangs come out great start them off long
and you're gonna cut up gradually so
this is what we're doing here we're just
cutting off extra after that that was a
rough cut you know but I already know
for myself how I want them to look so
this is gonna be a trial and error
continue to do this on your head keep
checking it on your head if you're
cutting your own bangs this might not be
the greatest for you because if I cut
them too short depending on how short is
too short I can just pull my wig forward
but if they own your head girl they did
and you know bangs are not the cutest
when they're cut wrong so here I'm just
going in and I'm gonna just even out
where I want all of my bangs to hit
because if you do not do this correctly
your bangs are going to look crazy so
because I'm having layers on the side of
my face I'm cutting a just a tad bit
wider than I would previous bangs now
here is where you're gonna call your
layers into so what you will want to do
is take it and put a slight bend in it
because it's gonna make cutting much
easier for you so let's see what we're
gonna do now so here I'm just checking
to make sure that everything is like I
want it and everything is cut properly
and it's even and it's bumped right cuz
I like my bangs with a bump in them I
don't like when they just like how
Barbie's bangs be she don't have no bump
they just straight and straight across
so try to put as much bump in it as you
would want and how you would wear so as
you can see if somebody had a super long
as they pretty much weight this what
their hair would look like when it had a
bit of a bump to it if they had a Hugh
super long forehead but we're not gonna
leave it here so what I'm gonna do now
is I'm gonna go ahead and start cutting
but I'm gonna just cut the middle
because in the finished product the
middle of like my know above my nose
will be higher than the sides of my face
because I'm going for more like a
mushroom ish look if you're going for
more of a a China bang or you know some
Chinese bangs then you wouldn't do this
step you would cut everything evenly so
you would do this part and then you will
go ahead and then you would do the other
sides as well you wouldn't just do the
middle but because mines is gonna have
more of this kind of 2d look to it but
not so much I'm gonna do this so as you
can see the middle is gonna start to get
very very high which is what we want
so here when you cut your layers you
want to pull them and then cut them very
lightly and you're gonna start to see
how the layers on the sides start to
form it's very easy so you just go in
you pull it out away from you and then
you go ahead and just pretty slightly
take your shears and you go down and
just cut so here I'm going in and I'm
just gonna keep doing that and as you
can see once we get a little further
down in the video I'm gonna actually
start pulling it from the back as well
so that I can get more and more layers
so everything just looks like one full
unit as opposed to bangs on the top and
layers on the bottom and you'll see once
we go a little further now for some of
you guys this is probably where you
would stop if you want it little more of
a china bang with a little layers on the
side this is where you would stop for me
I'm going all the way in we're gonna go
home with it baby
just make sure you pray but you know
this is something that is based on
preference and I like for my layers and
my bangs to all be one you see how
there's a gap between the bang and then
right here we're gonna take all of that
out and we're gonna make sure that it
all is one unit
and as you guys see I keep going back
and making sure I'm bumping it just so I
won't cut too much off I already put my
lines in for where I want it to be but
just to be on the safe side so here
we're just doing the same thing which is
just cutting a lot of that bulk off to
give it more of a sleek look in the
front so when the wind blows when I move
my head when I whip my head it's all
layers as all you see is fringing layers
and that's the look ultimately that
we're gonna get this does take practice
if you're not good with shears and
scissors and things of that nature it's
gonna take a minute because again if you
close them too hard they will cut a
straight line so just remember that the
lighter the hand the more of a feather
look you'll get the heavier of the hand
the more of a blunt look you're gonna
get
remember always use your flat iron -
just to make sure we're to see what your
final look is gonna look like sometimes
when you do this and you're either doing
it where you're holding the hair it got
a lot of texture in it you really can't
see until it's done I like to work in
the final product type of thing I think
I get that from working with Photoshop
where you can see what it look like in
its in so with that being the situation
I like to see what my final product will
look like before I go any further cuz I
want to fix something if it's bad before
I get all I've done it before
completely done and I've been mad so
here you can see we're starting to take
shape now now it has more of that
mushroom and should look to it so now
I'm gonna go in and then Flatiron in
layers to make sure that the bump is
exactly what I want it to be because
this is how I would ultimately wait
Oh as you can see we still have like
it's not very even in the bank area and
we're gonna go in and just you know make
that much more neater but here we go
we're gonna do this again which is
you're gonna pull it forward and as you
can see everything is starting to flow
together so it's it's a time consuming I
mean here is time consuming period
that's why you spend more hours getting
it done then you actually do flinging it
in the streets because you tired but
that's what I'm going in I'm just going
in and make sure that all my layers are
one
all of them are flowy they all look
great they all are even and it's gonna
take a little bit more time for you to
refine this so don't get like you've
liked all my looks you know really
choppy that's fine just go back and once
you start to see where everything is
you'll get it it's very like simple into
the fact but you see I'm pulling it from
the back so that I can make sure that
all that has layers in it too so if I
pull my hair forward it looks great if I
put it behind my back it also still
looks great but you just don't want it
to be all one length and less that's the
look you're going for with this that's
not what I'm going for my previous look
it was kind of that this is later this
is kind of like a layer and bangs
tutorial but if you was to do this on
your hair with a middle part this is
what you would do as far as to get your
layers to look like such so when cutting
layers you always want to pull it from
the around the back and then you want to
cut at an angle if that makes any sense
you guys see me do it before it's not
that hard but if you guys need me to do
more in an in-depth on how to cut bangs
and layers I will but I feel like this
is pretty self-explanatory
and again don't be afraid to go ahead
and fire up that Flatiron and while
you're doing is to make sure that that
look is what you want because you can
see pretty much what the ultimate look
will look like and will be so now you
see there's still too long so what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna go I'm gonna grab
a clip and I'm gonna find where the
where my nose is and that's as much as I
want to cut so we're gonna take this and
then we're gonna go ahead and cut it so
since I know exactly where that was now
I'm gonna go and just cut that off and
then make the round out the top of the
bangs so as you can see here if you
wanted to like some china bangs straight
across with a little bump will give you
just that look so if you you would stop
here if this is the look that you wanted
not necessarily the side parts but put
out those this would be some nice neat
china bangs but we're not doing that so
what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna go in
and connect the sides to the middle
and I'm just softening up that very
blunt line so that everything flows
together pointing cotton this is
something that does take a little time
to get used to and it also depends on
the sharpness of the shears sometimes
you know you could use a dull pair and
you get used to that then you get a new
sharp pair and you just tear your whole
wig up cuz trust me I've done it so
don't feel bad but yeah once you get
used to this and used to you know the
sharpness of your shears I need a new
pair but I don't really cut that often
but I'm gonna leave me a new pair for
sure but yeah it just it could be
becomes a I can do this in my sleep now
and I remember being in school and I
this was something I struggled with very
very hard like just to get a blunt cut
that wasn't crooked so practice does
make perfect or close to it so now it
looks like Sharif Azir
and because I was doing this on camera I
kept happen to look into the viewfinder
to see if I was tripping as a monitor I
was like I don't know if there's a peace
there or is it just the angle of it but
yeah just make sure you keep checking it
and checking in and checking and
checking it but I've kind of marked it
as you notice where these pins are where
my eyeline would be so yeah
like I said always going with your
Flatiron and bump it to where you would
actually wear to see if you need to do
more cutting or you should stop because
sometimes it trust me I know it's very
easy to get very scissor happy like why
got this these layers is good and you
put it on and girl as a head so here as
you can see the side was still excuse me
for not shaving but for those who say I
don't grow facial hair lots of Minnelli
hundred lies but here I just went in and
did some work while I was on my head to
kind of see exactly where I wanted it to
be if you're not comfortable with this
don't do this cuz you will light
yourself up it's not really smart but
this is kind of the gist of where
everything was and how I wanted it to
look when it was all said and done so
we're gonna get to the final look right
after this so you should end up with
something like this
layers of galore and a beautiful helmet
made of hair so hope you guys enjoyed
this one again this Harris from Ally
