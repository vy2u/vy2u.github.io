really quick so that's to be glued I
already have used a layer to lay down my
edges so that it will not be loose it's
best if they're intact in quite stiff as
well when you do this because it's gonna
make a bit better for you to just have
just the laced when you're trying to
fight the lace with you know and you got
sparse hairs or problem so I put a layer
a nice generous layer then I use the
blow dryer to go ahead and kind of get
it a little bit tacky kind of how you do
eyelash glue so I like to personally
just take all of the extra baby hair
that is around it and pin it back it
makes it easier usually I like to start
from the the very middle to make sure is
lined up because I don't want to do the
sides and didn't end up with my lace
halfway down my face because this
particular one does not it's not made
for my hairline so the size didn't fit
exactly like I wanted to so had I tried
to force them to fit then I would have
ended up with a hairline that was two
inches from my forehead so I like to
just go ahead and take the piece of the
rat tail comb as you can see here and
just kind of blend a little bit of the
baby hairs that are laying out into the
hairline SOI looks a little bit more on
the natural side so as you can see I'm
just I have the blow-dryer own cool do
not put it on high because going to take
forever to dry put it on cool as cool as
you can get and put it on high so as you
can see is just you have to just kind of
hurry up and wait for anything wait so
then this side I just was going ahead
and pulling it but as you can see it's
not made so I used it when because
nothing usually fits in my hairline
unless I get
specifically made for my hairline I just
like to go ahead and take the glue I
mean in the gel and put it on my
hairline and then just take my baby hair
toothbrush you can kind of pull it down
so we're just gonna look as if my hair
is just kind of not everywhere but it's
going to lay down on the side it's not
going to just be this line of
demarcation where it just looks like I
don't I know you got a little gun we
don't want that so that's the look that
I was going for it here and then I'm
going to do the same thing on this side
but the difference I did on this eye was
I pull it a little bit closer only
because this is my favorite stood and
take it I like to just take it put it
right on the lace as you can see and
then I like to take my fingers and just
go ahead and rub the hair as I'm drying
it towards you know around kind of like
in a circle and what it's gonna do is
you're going to lay those hairs down
it's going to keep the lace to the side
of your head so that it lays down like
it's supposed to
now you see the top looks great and
because I had a middle part in my thighs
would be um concealed for the most part
except for part like one side then
that's the only didn't everyone matter
so go ahead and take your pins out
go ahead and comb and you're pretty much
finished even though I should I usually
do this after the fact but my part is a
skew off because I had did this and I
put a little bit concealer because the
glue got into my part which I didn't
plan to do but I'm not used to doing
this on camera I'm used to doing this in
a mirror but yeah that's really all it
takes it's not hard it's easy again a
little bit of warm water and it will
pill right on up and um yeah I hope you
guys enjoyed this and I hope it was
informative it wasn't too fast but it's
really pretty much self-explanatory guys
you don't really need yeah goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
