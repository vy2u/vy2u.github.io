tutorial on how to layer your wigs or
your weaves or whatever when you first
get them now this particular wigs that I
have on is a new one and I will be
reviewing it is from classic lace wigs
um it is a light yaki um texture but
I'll get into all that for the review
but for right now before I did a review
I wanted to cut it to show you guys cuz
I promised that I would do a review on
how to cut your or your legs or whatever
you choose uh to wear when you first get
them because you know when you first get
these things they're not um like this
out of the package and you know there
there are no layers as you can see this
uh unit is 22 inches so it's it's pretty
long but it's not as long as I usually
wear you guys know I usually wear about
24 I think the longest I ever had was 30
so and I'm only 5'4 so my hair is
usually SuperDuper long um but for those
who want a little less length um we're
gonna base it I'm basically going to
show you the basic way to do um you know
layers or whatever now as you can see if
I do this this kind of shows me where I
want this bang piece to be at some point
and here right here since this is like
my long straight piece I want the layers
to start from my chin and they're going
to go all the way down so what you're
going to need is you're going to need a
regular comb of any sort that you choose
and I have some cutting shears that are
not in here but these were in here now
these are some the ninja trophy
stainless steel or ones they have the
little I don't know the little rubber
thing so they won't clack together um I
have two pairs of these and then I have
a regular pair of shears that I use to
like cut open packages then sometimes
I'll layer with those but these are
super duper short um I have seen
tutorials where people have used paper
scissors and stuff like that and that's
not the best thing to use especially if
you buy expensive hair or an expensive
wig you don't
cut it with something that is cheap
because it tears the hair doesn't cut it
which leads into split in so that hair
every time you may die it or flat iron
it gets worse and worse to the point
we're gonna have to keep cutting it so I
would say invest into a pair of shears
because you will your hair will thank
you later even with you know your real
hair you don't want to cut it with
something that's cheap or I'm going to
say cheap because sometimes cheap is
good but something that is not up
quality don't cut a 200 Allah wig with
five dollar shears or scissors because
you're going to see it so um we're going
to start on this side and and work away
to decide now what I usually do is I
just you know come out everything that I
want and we're going to start long and
then we're going to work our way into
what we want and I'm gonna just do that
for people who don't necessarily know
what they're doing I can do this in one
fell swoop and it's okay but you know
when I was learning um we were taught
you know you start off long because you
can always take off more but you can't
add any so if you take off too much yeah
you don't want to mess up a wig so I
usually just take just the front because
I'm only gonna frame the front and
that's about this much I'm only the rest
of that is going to be just like it is
because I don't like too much hair off
now this is a 22 inch you can easily
turn the 22 inch into a 18 inch if you
cut it wrong okay or sometimes 16 I've
seen it so since we're going to start
from here then we're just going to take
it you're gonna put your shears at an
angle and you're just going to cut down
like this and really small quick strokes
and it's going to start to take off the
hair that don't be scared
you know a little bit for it because
then you going you're gonna see it in
the cut now as you can see now that kind
of gave me a guideline to wear the rest
of them are gonna pretty much go at this
point you know so now it has more of a
you know has more of a cut to it it
looks it frames my face a little bit
more than a day before when it was just
like Morticia Addams trade so then
you're going to go in that same spot
again you're going to take off some more
okay and you see starting seeing like
see like this part now is shorter then
this part and you see how it all flows
together though it's one unit it's not
any gaps or anything and that's pretty
much it like there is no big secret
there is no big thing to it so when you
pull all of this forward it has a it's a
graduation now you know so compare that
to this side you know and it's just
something light in airy and you know
something small nothing crazy now what I
usually will do at this point is I'll go
in to start to go into this area and
I'll match this side with right here so
we'll just take this and we're going to
just go here hold on y'all cuz I'm doing
this on camera I cannot see are you
going to just go here we're not going to
take all this off
we're going to take some off and what
this is going to do is it's just going
to give the hair more of a more of a
volume and it's not going to look so pin
straight it's going to have a little
texture to it which you want like this
you see like how it has a little texture
in here now then it's just being
straight and you would just do this
until you finish the sides so I'm just
gone and do
I wanna pay you gotta pitch with you
okay now you see you have some nice
pretty layers they move they're not too
much you know it doesn't take much it's
not like rocket times you know it's just
it takes patience and it takes practice
because I would say practice on some
cheap air that you may have or cheap old
you part you don't want now for the
front is this all honestly depends on
you and what you want pretty much um as
far as your bank is concerned because I
like mines to be a little on a longer
side although some people like theirs on
the shorter side so it just depends so
you just take this hair and you put it
you just give yourself daily you know
all in place and then you take about as
much as your your your fingers can
handle which would be this much for me
if you got bigger hands then it may
change um now you're going to start this
like I said it depends on you want but
I'm going to start mine at my nose so
it's going to start here and it's going
to go down so you're going to start here
and then you're going to just start to
cut
and you're going to cut out an angle
because you don't want it too long and
you don't want it too short so now you
see at this point this is starting to
look like my other one you know like it
has because when you start from the nose
remember you're going to move the hair
out of your face so you don't want it to
be too long and you don't want it too
short now now you have your guideline
from where your hair was and then you're
going to take like you did on the other
side about as much as you need like this
and you see there's already layers in it
because of what I just clicked already
so now you're just going to take it and
do exactly what you did on this side to
this so you're just going to simply take
take it start from your guideline and
you're going to go
and then you're going to take this I'm
going to do the bottom and then you're
going to go and again here and on this
side you're not going to do as much as
you did on this side only because this
is a swoop you don't want it to get thin
um that's not the look you're going for
and remember this still applies if you
have a little part your part is on the
other side of your head it's all the
same standard procedure it just depends
on how much hair you do want to cut off
remember it's not no wrong or right way
to do it unless this choppy and that's
not which one but other than that you
know you just want to get some basic
body this hair is not the fullest but it
is a little thicker than my other one
ones so you know remember that too it's
not it depends cuz um what's the Sam
you're drooling oh you don't want it uh
this putting layers in your hair as a
body so and adds movement and remember
if that's not what you want then keep it
how it is and only cut the front if you
want some body and some movement and
this is the other then you know this is
a great easy way to do that without
having to go to a shop or go somewhere
and get it done by someone now usually
I'll go half way around my head I never
do the back and the reason why I mean I
can obviously take this off and do the
back if I choose to but that's not what
I'm trying to do I only want it in the
front and on the sides
okay so we're going to do about that
much and y'all should see all the air
that is in my lap right now but it
doesn't make me feel any like usually
when I cut hair depending on what it is
you're just like oh I hate all that good
hair but no I don't feel in this type of
way about it because look how great it
looks now like it has much more body in
it it has much more movement in it it
looks more natural than it did before we
started when we started the video you
know you can do that now it's you know
it has more of a natural appearance to
it versus what it did before and it just
takes a little bit of cutting a little
bit of layers and a little bit of
patience so remember use your face as a
guideline you want to start from under
your chin on this side and you want to
start from the middle between your nose
and your mouth on this side or if you
want it longer you would start probably
between your between your lips so yeah
that's pretty much it and I will be I'm
about to do the review for this wig now
but we have any questions or anything
let me know and if you are interested in
this wig it's on classic lace wigs and
look out for my review for it coming
soon so I will talk to you guys later
and you have any questions let me know
and this is all the hair that I did cut
off so it didn't seem like I cut off a
lot but it was a nice amount it wasn't
horrible though you know I've cut way
more often in other wigs but you don't
want to cut too much off because
remember this wig is only 22 inches so
you don't want to make it into a teen
accident you know
on purpose so yeah I'll talk to you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
