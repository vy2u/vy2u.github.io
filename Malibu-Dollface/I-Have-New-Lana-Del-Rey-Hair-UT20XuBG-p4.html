you guys are gonna accent my hair right
now and I curled it with the flat irons
to give it this wavy this wavy look or
whatever and you guys know I love me
some Lana Del Rey that is just like oh

to do my hair like this based on the
hair that I've seen her I'm here so I've
seen her have like the old Hollywood get
down this hair that I have in is not the
same hair that I had in my previous
videos nothing curling here this is the
scheana hair emporium this is a straight
hair and 28 26 22 and 24 I have four and
a half bundles and I got it on a you
part not a sew-in I did it myself

ol old Hollywood waves get down I bet
