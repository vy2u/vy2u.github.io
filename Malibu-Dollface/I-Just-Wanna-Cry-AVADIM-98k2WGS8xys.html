but if I look like I'm about to cry it's
cuz I am I am having a day a day a day
and I'm trying away from my hair to
finish so I can do it and do this but um
this video is just gonna be a quick into
the point video it's a video on a day it
may honestly how long it was gonna be I
just ate a video if you are going to do
something or you are having like things
in your life are just talk to
somebody okay like legit cuz right now
how I'm feeling I need to go talk to
somebody and it's not like suicide or
anything like that those are you know
obvious reasons to go talk to somebody
I'm going for my hair to say it but it's
like I'm dealing with so much and I
don't know at this point like how I'm
how am I gonna do with all of this right
now you know how that feeling of unknown
in what the I literally and I
always feel like I'm the person who
people come to because they have their
issues and their problems and they're
just trying to figure it out if its
wobbly I'm sorry but today it just felt
like everything was wrong I was going
through everything
 was bothering me it's just a lot
you know and I think people don't often
see that side and I deal with it but
then it's like when I was reaching out
to some of my friends they were not
reaching back they were busy all of
these things and for me as a person that
is the worst ever when you are
going through something and you feel as
if somebody just doesn't give a
about how you feel but yet and still
when they go through everything and then
some you need to be there were bills on
to get them through it and that's what
I'm starting to learn listen I may have
a lot of answers for y'all but as a
person I still got my own that I
deal with and there's some stuff that I
allowed that I know I shouldn't and it
gets to me and then I get to this point
and then I get on the point where I'm
about to record a video and I'm holding
back tears because my feelings are so
hurt you know like it's a lot I'm not
gonna lie to you guys it's a lot this
life that I'm living right now is so
cushy and it's so nice but it comes with
a lot of stuff that I personally I don't
like you know I'm saying I just
don't like it's friendships are ending
friendships are beginning relationships
or any relationships or beginning it's
like it's a life and for me as a person
I like stability I like things to be the
way that they are I really don't like
change very much I don't since my hair
but I'm really not a big person for
change but for me as a person I just
feel a lot of times what happens is
people forget that you're human you go
through stuff when you have your
feelings are hurt like no no stranger
could ever hurt my feelings okay
because I've been like I told y'all
before I've been called worse not better
by people in my own family which like
come on but you feel it my feelings get
hurt by people that I know you know I'm
saying for stuff that they know or
unknown ly do to you and then you feel a
way about it and I just wanted to say to
anybody who's right now going through
something and you may feel away or you
may be in your feelings don't think you
by yourself because even some of us
youtubers who sit up in here with a
whole bunch of brows hair we still going
through something I've literally done
videos where I had to cry in between to
get through it so if you feel alone
right now just know I feel you boo we're
going through it together and we're
gonna get to it but it's okay to not
always be okay it's okay to not always
be your best you it's okay we always got
tomorrow to start over but it doesn't
change in the moment how you feel and
right now I feel like and right now
I feel like crying
and right now I just want to take my wig
off and say I made it I mean I I just
took some medicine cuz I feel like I'm
getting a cold I was a take my medicine
off um
but right now I just want to take my wig
off and go to sleep you know I'm saying
like I don't want to be like I don't
want to do this right now but I know
that I have to cuz I made promises I
made commitments and I took money so I
have to but I just wanted to say that
really quick if you go on through
something just know it's gonna be okay
and sometimes you don't know when it's
gonna be okay but eventually somes gotta
give okay so I will catch y'all in my
next one let me go finish this and I
love y'all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
