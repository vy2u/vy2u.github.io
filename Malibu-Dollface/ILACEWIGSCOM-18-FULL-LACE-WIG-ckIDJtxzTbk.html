huh
whoa whoa whoa whoa vocals so we're
gonna talk about this wig that I'm
rocking right now this is my straight
this bone straight Morticia Addams get
down from a lace wigs and I'm gonna give
you guys the pros and the cons on this
cuz I'll never work with this company
before and this is indeed a lace wig but
there are a couple hang-ups that I
really don't like so we're going to get
to they bring you to the information
first so this particular unit is SKU
number GFL three one of four as you see
there they put on the back which is
something new I've never got a wig where
it was I post on if I always get a card
and this is good because if you keep the
box you won't lose information a lot of
times y'all when I get like cards I lose
them especially if I had the hair for
quite some time you don't know how we're
happy to since that came in the box is
so when I received my way they came in
the container like such it came in this
long bag it has the little unli net on
it and then this clip in the inside
between it when I received it when I
first got it this wig had that cone at
the top like you can kind of still see
it on this side but it was like this
very Cornish shape so it took a lot of
hair spur for me to get it as flat as it
is because I first did not look like
such to the specs of this hair it is a
1d so it is a natural black the hair
length is 18 and I don't know I don't
have my ruler with me so I can't really
tell you how long if it it really is 18
but yeah it is silky straight and that
is very true this hair is very very very
silky it says that it's 110 to 120
density we're gonna talk about that
because I don't think you
neither but okay this is a glueless full
lace wig so I can part this all the way
in the back let's lace all back here
it's no tracks whatsoever it's virgin
hair it is not a silk top unit it says
there's baby hair along the perimeter
which I personally didn't see to give it
more of a realistic natural look so
we're going to start off with the
density the density of this wig is
extremely extremely thin when I tell you
extremely thin this reminds me of a
company that I will not mention um how
they first started off and your wigs
were really thin is if this is 110 to
120 density I do not believe that
because I'm gonna tell you all the hair
pulled together this is how thick it is
this is it this is how thick the hair is
okay this is like equivalent to a bundle
okay um it's just how thin it is
together that's how thick it is and for
some of y'all because I'm wearing it
bone straight y'all might like the hair
like this like oh that's it's a very
natural look don't get me wrong it's
very natural
super natural extremely natural but it's
not my idea of natural because it's so
thin I can only wear it like this um I
think they need to update their if this
is their density in whatever density
chart they're using any two of their
density - at least 150 because 158 gives
you more of a thicker but this is
ridiculously thin okay like yeah
and it looks great like this but I'm
telling you let the wind blow and then
it's just it's thin central like I could
these these wigs that come thin like
this are great for everyone I have the
middle part with the whole Kim
Kardashian behind the ear key down these
are good for those because you see how
easy it is and it's real flat because
the hair is not so thick it'll sit
behind my ear like this don't mind my
cyber and I put no edge control but
and now if I did when I do this it looks
real natural and real like this is what
these wigs are really good for he's
going for a nice little natural pretty
look these are great this is not for the
ba-ba-boom um I want it bundles down to
my socks this is yeah this doesn't
really go break for that that's one
thing that I don't like about the way
the next thing that I don't like about
it is the I don't like the hair line as
you guys see it's behind my hairline
because okay so I'm going to put video
here of me actually showing you what the
inside of the wig looks like it says
that their company is called eye lace
wigs but the problem that I'm having is
there was no lace in the front it was
already pre-cut there's a very thick
piece of lace that goes around the
perimeter of the way the hairline part
so it doesn't lay down exactly how I
wanted to lay down so this will be one
of those units that you would actually
have to take tape and take down your
part in order for it to lay down because
it's not going to do it naturally I
currently don't have any on I just have
it really snug there is an adjustable
strap in the back of this but there is
no lace around the perimeter and you
guys know as I'm doing a lot of more
frontals and for lace wigs I like to
actually customize my hairline for these
particular wigs now and I cannot do it
with this i tempered to do with it but
because it's so edged up it's really
difficult to do so so you're going to
have that straight out the box wig look
if you don't pull it behind your
hairline because there's nothing really
you can do what I actually tearing the
lace trying to pluck out those hairs
around the front it's just that it's not
full like I wanted and I don't like the
perimeter now the actual build of the
wig is very nice the way that they put
the hairs in this way I really like
because you see how it lays down really
really flat and I can go ahead and just
take another bundle that I have just
laying around and so I'm in the back of
this wig and it'll be great but for me
personally I'm not a big fan because I
feel as if
overall the wig I find it if I give it a
1 to 10 I would give it a 5 because I
feel like the hair is really great I
find out the party was not as difficult
as I thought it was going to be in order
to actually do and then I actually I
actually like the length of it as well I
like the shorter 18 inch I don't know if
I asked for 18 inch I'm not really sure
that's what they ended up sending and I
don't mind it at all I think that the
length is very appropriate and it really
works for those again for you guys to
like probably 18 and under this is great
for a little more value but not crazy
I'm just not crazy about the density of
it that's the really thing I think if
the density was thicker I can get over
the lace but since the lace is not their
anti density is not as thick as I would
like it to be that's kind of the thing
so I lace wigs
I like the idea I just don't really like
the execution because everybody doesn't
like their hair to be super thick but
this is not thick enough at all like
this is just enough I can get away with
you know whatever but it's not crazy
full I mean even most people whose hair
is thin this may be a very realistic
like I said you want to bust one of
these this is great for it because if
it's not going to be thick it's not
gonna be crazy full it's gonna be just
enough to get the look that you want and
you can have the look that I had in one
of my other videos but the problem is
you don't want to wear it like this then
you have to find another wig because
otherwise this is not going to do what
you want it to do and it's not going to
be full enough so that's my only hang-up
with this if it was even it says it is
110 to 120 density full if it was like
150 and it was like if I'm putting some
track terms if it was like for more
tracks I would be very happy
I'll be very fulfilled with this but
because it's not I just can't really get
into this it's so here I have to give I
laced with a nice 5 out of 10 because
there's there's a few things you gotta
face but overall the company was
nice on the package it came very well
packaged it came really quick a lot of
times I forget to tell you guys I got
mines with a loop of actually agreeing
to work with them I got it within a week
and a lot of other people that I've seen
that they reviews um they said they got
theirs within a week it's left so I will
I will say that a flatiron beautifully
when I first got it it had like a little
bit of a wave into it because it was in
that bag so it wasn't it's flat and it
straight is this and I run I ran my flat
iron through it and they made sure I
really really made this top because the
top part was extremely extremely fair oh
when I got it which is crazy because the
wig is not that thick but the top was
not having it so yeah other than that
that's that's not kind of all I got here
and I would like to work with them again
because I hope that they listen to what
I'm saying for just a customer and they
kind of up that density to show the
difference and I know sometimes it takes
a company a little bit longer but we
shall see what happens from here but if
you guys are interested in this one
again this is a 18 inch one be a virgin
I didn't tell me exactly what origin of
hair this is I am neither but I'm gonna
take that is Brazilian straight because
that's what I'm getting from it um it
can be either Brazilian straight or it
could be Indian and only to that I feel
like this here would actually that it
resembles um so yeah I bleach all up
later and hit those links below and
check out my next video god of y'all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
