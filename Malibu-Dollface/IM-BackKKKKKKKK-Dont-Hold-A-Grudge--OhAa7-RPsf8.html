and give it up for the new year for the
new you mmm-hmm so welcome to my new
channel which is doll face Barbie Tim
and nothing's changed really much as far
as my channel is concerned the only
difference is as you can see I'm I'm
still in the same place but I am not
literally in the same camera position
and as you can see the camera looks a
little bit better I don't know why they
sure does edition this this video is
just like an introduction for those who
have never been to my channel before so
kind of get an insight on Who I am as a
person and we are going to do a topic
just to let you guys know cool um these
are the shoes that I'm wearing with
these I have some leather shoes on so
but I took them well there was a patron
but I took them off um no particular
reason you know I was just you know yeah
um so okay good anyway I haven't did
this in so long it feels like I haven't
did this shit in ages but I have anyway
I wouldn't give a shout out to all of my
team dogface people like for real let me
just say this to say the least
you listen to all of my team doll face
people y'all are like the dope is and
I'm not just saying the people who run
like $50,000,000 pages which I
appreciate and I appreciate I appreciate
each and every one of those pages cuz
you know it's really hard to kind of get
a team of people behind you but I got it
and I appreciate it and y'all ain't
never gonna hear me talk greasy about
sake um but I do want to say that it
means a lot that all of these people
have rally behind me in this journey to
become successful
it means the world you know it really
does I sit back and be like to hang all
these people in the world I wanna kill
myself in it I don't know if you would I
got my back so anyway I hope you guys
have a great New Year money it was good
my money my new year was good mister
will kick there one of our friends broke
in broke her foot not her lay her foot
who they'll call her broken leaking it
she broke her foot um she went to a rave
and she broke her foot and it was very
traumatic
so she thought she had the cast now um
so well it's doing good everybody's
still cool everybody thinks that we hate
each other or something I don't know why
but they'd be that we hate each other we
do not hate each other they will be on
my channel more so than they were last
year if anything now you know so
definitely um for those who were asking
me about the radio show I don't do the
radio show was broken anymore she does
about herself but I chose personally to
not do the radio show anymore it wasn't
nothing between us or anything like that
but you know I'm spiking I feel as if
this is not really for me but I still
support you so make sure you guys
support broken legs Sunday nights blog
talk radio it's still be John I mean
it's still thought faced and broken I
don't know she's gonna change the link
I'm not for sure but for right now
that's all the information that you have
been getting is still the same um what
else that is going on with me I don't
know I think I pretty much covered
everything so we can kind of get into a
topic now cuz I know you're tired of
hearing me ramble about nothing so we
don't reposition the body and oh and
another thing too on this channel I'm
gonna be doing a lot more videos where
they're just kind of in depth I might do
a video and it might be this close to my
face
um and please forgive me for bad angles
and things like that coming up because
these are going to be more handheld type
situations and things of that nature
and another thing I'm gonna address I am
doing this video via my ipod touch okay
and the reason is because I can't find
the courts my other camera and this
camera happens to be HD and I won't feel
like going on a mother
camera you know I mean I could just
bobby some more shoes out the case so uh
yeah that's not me the stopping I do you
want to discuss with you guys though is
holding grudges and the reason why I
wanted to do this topic is because um I
think it's very important for us to
understand that when you don't kind of
like shit go like for instance the new
year I was gonna do a New Year's video
about this but I did I so decided
against it because I have been just lazy
with I was lazy like the last month yeah
I was lazy as fuck I don't want nothing
I was just like mmm where's your
diagnosis murder
you know and I'd be on a computer or
iPad on my phone all day so if it's not
this is this and it's just it becomes I
am ashamed but it's okay cuz I'm doing
stuff now you know I'm saying you feel
me I'm be honest I'm beyond it doesn't a
new thing I'm about to be porn okay so
anyway holding grudges I feel like in
life when things happen to you our
people do things to you or started
situations happen we need to learn how
to let you go
and when I say let it go I mean let it
go well not let it go for the moment or
let it go right now I mean let it go and
general because what happens is when you
start to let shit kind of get under your
skin
they starts to eat away at you and you
start to miss out on good things that
are happening in your life because
you're just so upsetting you made it
bitter and you mad over some shit that's
not even one thing like forever okay I
had a problem I had a problem with a
particular person on YouTube
yes I did and this person I addressed
the issue with them and I let it go I
mean this person winning Gorham won but
I do respect the person for what they're
doing and I do respect the person that
they are rather me and this person are
not cool anymore I don't have any hard
feelings towards them at all I never
really had like hard feelings towards
them I just was a little hurt by the
things that they did alright they did or
something they did or they said they did
or they really did so you know I
basically told them you know everything
is fine everything is cool I'm good with
you you build me I'm good with you
that's how I feel about it and I'll go
I'll go about my day since the new year
was coming in that's where I was trying
to go it at that point when the new year
was coming in I was going to a video
about holding grudges and how you should
let things go for the new year I don't
even think it's just for the new year I
think it's just in general in life when
you learn how to kind of fucking put it
when you learn how to fun at all when
you learn how to fine a village and kind
of say you know what what she did was
wrong
I didn't appreciate or what I did was
wrong cuz you some a lot of times you
have to make you wrong too
ain't you ain't perfect bitch ain't
nobody a motherfucking Barbie
you ain't perfect so if you did
something wrong and somebody apologize
whether they take your apology or not
you ain't gotta probably judge good ones
bitch you ain't got it under them turn
turn turn turn
no bitch all that is not necessary I'm
gonna tell you asked me once I'm sorry
if you don't get it that's your own
personal shit they got shit to do with
me okay it ain't that's the oh shit
handle it handle your scandal but with
me I miss our person if I have an issue
with someone I will address it and try
to put it you know let it go so we can
move past it if you don't want to move
past it I'm all good
that is so fine with me I'm so fine
about it I'm fine I mean a burn thanks I
just plan but if some people who act
like that though and that's gonna be my
next video cockiness but I was just
joking
but there are people you know who don't
know how to let shit go they don't they
will Harbor some shit for years on end
until they can't Harbor that shit no
more and then you look like what is this
giving you you know what is this giving
you because you miss out on blessings
you miss out on opportunities you miss
out on fun Chi because you're always
bitter mad what did I say on Twitter and
face but I'm not agreeing I think you
better you bro because you bitter and
you bitter because you broke and don't
nobody want to mess with a bitter broke
bitch so if you do have you know some
negativity in your life or somebody you
know who just can't you know get over
some shit they don't need to be a part
of your life your journey you clear you
cleanse their ass like a colonic you
just clear them out and say you know
what you my friend and I love you I do
but I don't respect you for the bullshit
that you putting up in my life and I'm
gonna let you go and if they had to know
just let him go nope that always it is
different relationships with friends
with family with whoever there are too
many people in his world for you to be
stuck with one person dealing with a
bull shit and I live by that model I
don't give a damn with you my momma if
you my mom and I love my mama
we goodly but if she was something else
and I didn't appreciate it I'll have
this is myself of her and we'll talk to
her
that doesn't mean that I don't love you
that doesn't mean that I don't care
about you that doesn't mean that we
ain't who that just mean that we and
cool right now and we ain't gonna be
cool either you know so that's the
difference I think that people don't
understand is that you can distance
yourself from people when they put
negativity in your life and they harbor
resentment towards you for shit that
happened what really we would 10 wit was
tan bitch we 24 now it was tan and you
still tripping over nothing you know it
shit like that and people are like that
is because they bitter you know they're
bitter about those
I know some little bitches I mean just
straight bit her like salty you know but
hey is that shoe that's you and that's
what that's what you like to do that's
what you like to do I don't really care
but for your own the people I'm talking
to now y'all my audience my people if
that's what's happenin that you are what
you just want a harbor shit for no
apparent reason then is definitely time
to let that go and whatever was sand
whatever was done is what it was and
it's not what it is and I think that's
what people forget is that that's leave
the past in the past and let the future
become your future don't Harbor yourself
don't have her to Harbor yourself really
I'm rusty y'all don't trip I'm just
saying um don't hinder yourself is what
I meant to say in regards to that last
comment that was made as such well yeah
pretty much that's all I'm saying
just don't hit yourself don't you know
I'm saying don't don't allow so don't
allow someone else to win y'all know
that's that that's our motto
I go by don't let them win cuz when you
let them win it becomes a problem do not
let them win because they feel like they
have some power on you over you ain't
nobody got no power over you
you ain't no fucking a bunny rabbit with
batteries in the back where they can
just push you you know I'm saying push
your buttons whenever they feel like it
unless you give them the power to do so
and no so that's pretty much it all I
had to say in regards to some regards to
that shout-out to all my subscribers
that are here on my new channel if you
still on my old channel which is da face
Barbie TM um bring your ass over here

bunch of subscribe

I feel like Dollface Barbie TM is like
my first success for our that's hot I
think about stuff it's like an artist
you know I don't think but I do run my
mouth and I feel like that's like I ran
my mouth for almost two years on a
channel that's like that's equivalent
equivalent to how long I am Sasha Fierce
by Beyonce was out I rolled that
motherfucker out until there was no more
track left I did a video for every
single I could think of and now I feel
like Dollface Barbie TV is like my new
album and it's time for me to build and
show y'all why I fell in love with me
that's how I feel because in all honesty
