o'clock there was a robbery and a couple
of died room is okay so I really love
this cut I do I usually forget how great
straight hair can be short because I'm
so used to wearing straight long hair
and this hair was originally that and
clearly that in heaven
so this hair that I'm wearing which is
three bundles of hair that were cut they
it was originally two bundles of 24 in
to 26 inches and this was from I see
hair and they had sent me this as well
as I don't remember what my frontal was
but it's Brazilian straight I don't know
what length of my frontal was I have his
hair for quite some time and it was
boring to me and usually hug you when
things are very born to me I usually be
like okay it's time to change something
so one day I had bored his hair because
it wasn't particularly straight straight
but it wasn't like it was it wanted to
wave over poof up it just wasn't my
favorite so I came in bored I just
grabbed one side and chopped it grab the
other side and just chopped it while it
was still takedown or whatever for those
who are asking me what I use to take
down my wigs I actually use this which
is the boat hold tape they didn't pay me
or sponsored me actually pay I bar like
forties with my own money they come with
these little tape pieces right here use
those around my hairline and it keeps my
wigs on with no problems
because I got to be glued
gotten a little bit on the annoying side
don't take down and I went ahead and cut
it took it off obviously and I evened it
out and made it this really cute
corporate ten o'clock news anchor Bob
and I wanted a very even Bob because I
hadn't had one and I don't think ever on
my channel at least I do a lot of here
off camera that I never upload if y'all
gonna ask me about my makeup I'm wearing
my Rihanna Fenty by the way which I have
a giveaway coming for that too but three
winners we'll talk about in a different
video
so you look at that cheekbone that's run
by the way that's room I was like I just
want something different I want
something that is easy going it's easy
flowing it moves you know it has body to
it I'm gonna turn around for you guys it
moves around and has body to it you know
it's cute or whatever and it's sexy
without it being long and like I said I
love my long hair you guys know I'm
known for my long hair but sometimes it
gets very very very very boring
especially when I'm reviewing hair and I
feel like they're sending me the same
thing then the look starts to become the
same the feel of the hair starts to
become the same um it just kind of feels
like Groundhog's Day type of thing so to
the actual color of the hair which I was
very pleased to know that the color was
actually consistent to what it was
supposed to be which was a natural one
be sometimes what happens is you'll end
up with a one be a bit of a 2 A 1 B and
then something almost as a fan of 4 and
you like King Joss is it just me because
I have what 4 lights right now so
there's two on the side for the
background and there's 2 in front of me
what these two usually in this and in
the lights in the camera I can tell what
color my hair is it's very different
that's why sometimes on camera I'll do
certain colors in the I'll be like why
does your hair look so bright compared
to mines and I did the same thing is
because I'm in front of these lights I'm
not as light as I look right now in
person okay I'm proud
whoa Rihanna in this red astronaut
engine I am a little bit redder than
usual okay and if my eyes are red is
because it is 105 and I am one no hours
of sleep I've been up for literally 24
hours so yeah I was like I just want to
do something that it's very simple that
anybody pretty much can do as long as
you got some clippers or whatever cuz
that's all I did was a clipper good I
didn't do nothing where I had when I
took the Clippers and went straight
across and I went ahead and repart it
bumped it and it was good so as far as
the color was goes I was cool with that
as far as the actual hair goes I didn't
experience any tangling at all even when
it was wet I didn't experience any of
that I did however get quite a bit of
shedding in the beginning portions of me
wearing the hair when it was still long
before I cut it seems like after I've
cut it I've been fine I haven't got
anything I can do this and you know no
issues on our problems but usually
that's how it works once you usually cut
the ends of hair and depending on if
they were split or not from my
understanding this hair did have a bit
of the ends were not is nice
I cut quite a leg at least an inch and a
half off of it initially when it was
straight I don't have any pictures every
straight but imagine my hair with two
twenty fours and two twelve doesn't even
true because I only use three bundles of
this hair because I didn't want my hair
to be SuperDuper thick cuz I had a
feeling that I was gonna end up having
to cut it like soon as I got it I was
like I might cut this hair but I'm not
sure you guys know I'm not sure if you
are aware but sometimes when you do cut
um if I'm getting car cross-eyed it is
because I'm looking directly at the lens
but sometimes when you know you're gonna
cut hair you might want to not put as
much because you don't want your hair to
not be able to do this which is move and
it don't look like a broom at the bottom
because what you're gonna have to do is
take some texturing shears and shear
down the bottoms of the hair so that it
actually curves in like this at the
bottom it doesn't have this big brush
look and as recently I've been seeing
that a lot on the red carpet like when
the BT wards we're going on
love cardi B's hair didn't like black
Chinese hair hated to Mars
whoa nah you know her her performance
wig her red carpet was mess but I
noticed that China's hair was cut very
bluntly but it wasn't framing her face
like such and had like a very straight
blunt and he was so thick at the bottom
that it kind of look like like resembled
a bit of a broom whereas the car Dee's
had a bit of a bump to it and it was
still thick thicker than I probably
would have liked but I liked that one
better overall so if you do want like
something like this get a pair of
clippers take the Clippers I would
personally for me I would cut the hair
first - at least if you're gonna cut it
in it's already long cut it's at least
here Dan you've cut the rest of it with
the Clippers you just take a flat iron
and bump the ends of it and then there
you go it's the same install that I did
with my baby here and all of this it's
still the same as I would do anything
else I did notice that when I did wash
his hair I had to put quite a bit of
conditioner in it so that it would stay
straight because it seems like it did
want a low-key tangle when I when I
washed it so I had to put some good
conditioner on it so I could stay cuz
you know the thing is people always like
why does your hair move like this in my
hair it doesn't move like that it's like
what did you wash it with because it
could just be heavy with a lot of
residue for whatever you washed it with
and it's still in the hair so I won't
move like that I did use a clarifying
shampoo on this hair and then I use a
lot of conditioner so the conditioner
gave me back the body that I probably
lost after I washed it with the
clarifying shampoo so if your hair is
dry and then you try to flat iron it and
get very staticky and it's not gonna
want to move it's gonna have a very
stiff feel to it um but overall I will
say that this is not bad hair for the
price and I do really like the front so
Delaney's my frontals have been pretty
much egg one for me I haven't had any
too too many gripes or issues with the
frontals that I've been receiving I will
say this though I was not a super-duper
fan of the way that the knots bleached
on this front so I wish there I had to
do it twice and usually especially
because of the bleach that I currently
use I usually have no issues and this
one took a little bit longer to - it
lifted clearly if it does look different
between my part that's how I know my
makeup is a different color because
usually my part is the exact color a
must
but Rihanna got me over here looking
real red so yeah I was definitely
inaudible ten nine out of ten I'll give
them an eight and a half because I
wasn't too crazy about the hair itself
it was fine for what it was but it just
wasn't SuperDuper straight like I said
but it wasn't enough to kind of like
curl it or anything like it was just
kind of like whatever so that's why I
ended up cutting it but this this itself
I really loved it I know they're like
screaming right now cuz they send me 26
inches and I cut it down to them near 14
but that's what happens with me after I
live with something for a while and I'm
not crazy about it I used to be like
whatever I'm gonna cut it that's what
it's review for you can't tell me what I
can and I can't do with something that
you sent me to review but I do like it
though I do like it a lot this is my
first time working with icy hair or
whatever and I will say yeah I did a
pretty good job only thing I would say
is upgrade the premium version of
whatever hair that you guys are using
you might want to upgrade it to make it
a little bit more on the straight side
because if it was SuperDuper straight I
would take it over being processed been
virgin just because for me if this was
super bone straight I probably wouldn't
put no pump in it I would have left it
just like that but whatever so yeah you
guys get an eight and a half for me I'm
not I don't I don't I mad at it I'm at
it so I hope you guys enjoyed this I
have a lot more videos coming and I will
catch you guys in my next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
