you can read it's not necessarily for my
younger generation but I did receive an
email here on YouTube um about a 25 year
old person I don't know if this was a
guy or a girl I'm not really for sure um
but they they don't know how to cope
with people's opinion of them you know
especially from family you know it's one
thing when it's coming from a complete
stranger but when it comes from family
so what I want you guys to do in this
particular video is really listen to
what I'm saying to you because it really
applies across the board this is not
just for family this is for a conundrum
of things um one thing I always tell
people is this I don't know everything
I don't know everything I don't I know
enough to understand that being socially
accepted and accepted in general as
always a positive thing versus a
negative thing so I understand when your
family accepts you and really loves the
things that you do it's something that's
great if they say bad things about you
it's not so great which you have to
understand is that family can be a very
beautiful thing and I spoke about this
in previous videos the family to go back
in the ugly but you have to understand
that everybody doesn't have your best
interest at heart and you have to a lot
of times treat family like a person on
the street a complete stranger because a
lot of times they don't want the best
for you you know it's sad you would
think they would but they do not so if
anybody has an opinion about you you
always look at the source because being
socially accepted is very yesteryear be
you are okay if no one accepts your
weirdness that's completely fine if you
have friends who are just like you that
is completely fine but you have to learn
to you have to embrace your flaws and
embrace your indifference because if you
spend life trying to be the next person
you're never gonna find out who you are
and by all means you can take
inspiration and be you know I guess you
could say you can you can be inspired in
and see other people do things a lot of
people email me and say they're inspired
to do YouTube they're inspired to be
their self they're you know watching
these videos I've helped him and that's
my purpose is to help you guys I'm not
dr. Phil I don't know everything across
the board I only give you knowledge of
things that I've personally been through
and fortunately for me in living I've
been through enough
in order to pass knowledge alone that I
might not have known when I was going
through it you know it's it's to help
especially the youth that's out right
now because I'm not speaking to just the
gay kids I'm not speaking to just the
transgender kids I'm not speaking just
to the straight kids I'm speaking I'm
not speaking to just the kids I'm
speaking to everybody but my target for
stuff like this is the younger
generation because our generation right
now is very lost and they're doing a lot
of this whatever you do I'm gonna do it
too whatever you do I'm gonna do it do
whatever you do I'm going to do it too
because I don't know how to be mean you
know and sometimes family will disown
you because you don't follow the path
your friends will disown you because
you're not doing what everybody else is
doing and to be accepted and still be
who you are is very rare today I have
friends who are so different from Who I
am
makes me love them even more I don't
wanna know about who does the exact same
thing that I do all the time that's not
fun that's like having a clone I like
everyone you have people from different
walks of life you're able to have
different
journeys throughout that walk of life
you know when you have the same stagnant
thing you're gonna always get that
everything has to change you notice that
when you go to a store the perfume might
have been over here and you come back
like a month later and the perfume is
over here yeah because you can't keep
something sitting like that
so apply that to life you can't just sit
because when you sit you're gonna just
sit and bore and rot and do nothing so
if the people that you are around are
not the people that accept you for the
weird kooky weird bitch that you are
them are not the that you
need to be around if nobody accepts you
for who you are a lot of us are grown
there's no need to be chasing friends
you are not in school anymore if you are
still in school apply this to school you
are individual everybody has a different
name everybody has a different walk of
life everybody has a different family
everybody has a different journey so
it's okay for you to be different
because while the rest of them are doing
with the rest of the world is doing you
could have been it there's there are
things that I've done five six years ago
that people are doing now
there are things I did a year ago that
people are doing now why because it's
trendy that's why they're doing it you
know so and I'm not like filling myself
or any no no no like that but I'm
just saying in general I was able to
walk my own path and do what I wanted to
do and it's funny how you get here and
people were here laughing at you here
but now they're here and you're already
here that's what I'm you got to stay ten
steps ahead of the game and not doing it
because you need to stay ten steps ahead
doing it because that's who you are
that's part of your life that's part of
your personality and body that learn to
do if you're if you're different I'd
never judge nobody based off the things
that they do whatever you choose to do
is your business I may not agree with
I may not think it's the hottest thing
in the world but Who am I to say what I
can and what you can do you can't do
because you may say the very same thing
to me why is your hair like that why are
you wearing this why are you wearing
that why are you living there why it can
be so much more so never let nobody tell
you about yourself never let nobody make
they feel like they somebody because
they have one okay I've said this time
and whoever watched me on a regular
basis y'all know they have one when any
but somebody says something crazy to you
especially involving something that
you're passionate about that may not be
what everybody else is doing that you
consider the source if the bitch is
raggedy and got no life on
Twitter all day retweeted
nothing but what's trendy on Instagram
posting everybody else's pictures the
bitch trying to copy this home wait 50
what 50 K consider this bitch a lost
cause because this hole has no identity
and she's mad at you or he's mad at you
because you don't own a pair of 750
dollar
Louboutins yet and still you have an
education yet and still you're doing
something better with your money yet and
still you didn't enroll school just to
get the money to get the Louboutins to
take your ass to the club you're
actually learning something so therefore
you consider the source no matter who it
is I don't give a if they got money
falling off they ask their money don't
make you smart okay some of the dumbest
people went to college understand that
and it did them no good so you can't
allow things to be a cop-out or an
excuse as to why somebody will
disrespect you the things that you love
or the person that you are be who you
are no matter what a bitch gotta say
because what a bitch gotta say is just
that it's chitter chatter and the
is cheap and free so nobody nobody puts
value on free you know so if a
bitch want to talk and you did
you this and I think you dad you agree
you're damn right bitch because you know
what why are you sitting up there and
that big ass crowd getting lost I'm
gonna be that one bitch that everybody
knows about I'm gonna be that one bitch
that sticks out and you won't be that
one bitch who if anything happens to you
and your little crew nobody we care
you're just another name why so look at
in terms of that it's not wrong to be
different it's not wrong to be a social
misfit it's not wrong to be an outcast
now it is wrong to try and do these
things for attention there is there
they're all wrong when you want to do it
because it's trendy you're still falling
into what I just told you it's not
necessarily the most proper thing but if
you happen to be a dude who grew up in
the hood and you don't like basketball
that's okay that'll make you gay that'll
make you soft
that doesn't make you that makes you who
you are if you are female who likes
football and you are not gay you are not
a lesbian that's fine
if you are a lesbian that is fine no one
can judge you on this earth because they
have no hell or heaven to put
you in so understand that people want to
play God never let nobody play what you
like that because nobody's worthy of
that understand that never give nobody
that much power I'm laughing off I've
laughed so much in the last week about
 that was said about me on my
stomach hurt I didn't do some nice
crunches because I'm learning as I'm
becoming older and in an adult a lot of
these want attention
attention and I will not applaud you for
your so learn to do that learn
to take people for exactly who they are
if they if they plotting and planning on
you separate yourself if they got a
problem with you being who you are no
matter what it is and I'm gonna say what
I don't give a what it is as long
as you're not hurting nobody
it's okay it's okay so who you been
friends with since she was in
kindergarten cuz apparently that bitch
ain't the same bitch from kindergarten
okay
the bitch hasn't changed the whole
little lifestyle and got a hold of her
him her cousin her mama and now they
living in a two-bedroom apartment but
yet it's still her daddy got a Bentley
picture wrong yeah you know it's just
little stuff like that prioritize your
friends your timing your money because
there are the only things that really
really matter in life and always could
put God first or whoever you believe it
if it's Buddha if it's Mario Brothers if
it's Barbie whoever I'm not gonna judge
you about who your higher power is just
make sure whoever you're praising to and
you're praying to is the person that you
put fern first before anything okay and
if you ever feel alone or you feel like
you can't talk to nobody and you're you
pray it works trust symbol it works okay
you don't have to be religious okay I
went and I hear the word religion in oh
but I'm a very spiritual individual okay
I have a very great connection with God
and nobody can ever take that away from
me so whatever your spiritual connection
is use it it's not going anywhere and
you use it to the best of your abilities
don't let it slip through your fingers
because when you have faith you have
everything and I don't mean to be like a
preacher right now but I'm just being
really honest with you I'm being God
knows I'm being as honest as I can right
now use that if you feel like you have
no friend you have a friend in God
seriously
like for real and stop putting so much
faith in man and put in faith in people
because they will fail you each and
every time okay
don't let somebody's accolades money or
whatever the situation is lead you to
believe that they're gonna be a better
person to you because that's what they
say or they're gonna be a better person
because their position is
or their circumstances are different or
their finances are different people will
 you over no matter what walk of
life no matter what gender what
race what occupation it does not matter
take people for what who they are and
what they tell you that they are if a
bitch tell you that she crazy
take her for that ever do tell you that
he will kick your ass and kill you take
it for that
don't try to test them and then you know
I'm saying they told you this you've
seen signs so if you see somebody then
got your best interest at heart
bounce to the islands okay
get the out
find somebody else find yourself get a
hobby paint plant a tree help
the bitch down the street do something
it's more to life than okay and
you're not wrong for feeling the way
that you feel you're not crazy
for being different okay weird is good
normal who wants to be normal normal is
what a majority that's what most normal
people in America are about 90% there
are 10% who actually live outside of the
box and don't do the myself
included so be who you are don't blend
in stand out and on that note peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
