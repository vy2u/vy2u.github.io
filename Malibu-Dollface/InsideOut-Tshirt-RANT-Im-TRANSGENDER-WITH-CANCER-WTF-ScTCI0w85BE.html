virgin hair and um watch it yeah I got a
text message from them and let me just
start off by saying this a lot of time
you guys always asked me and wonder like
you seem look like complain a lot about
stuff but this this is one of the things
that makes me a bit irritable and
irritated with the bullshit that the
internet brings um because you're I am
sitting on a nice Saturday mining my
good ol gay business and they send me a
text message about somebody saying that
they're me and they would like to do a
review from me of some sorts now here's
the thing I work with diamond version
here uh I think twice so I'm gonna read
you guys what this person sent please
understand that I am not illiterate by
like a longshot
and I don't have dyslexia and I'm not
trying to make fun of anybody who does
so well the way I'm reading is is just
simply how they put it out there hi
diamond diamond hair company that's not
even their name but okay diamond hair
company I want to do an a review for
your hair company and I've been doing
here review for a year and I never did
yours which is crazy because I did
everyone in the game and I don't have an
Instagram but when I call y'all wasn't
open and when I email y'all y'all
haven't emailed me back and you can look
me up on YouTube at Malibu Dollface and
also I try your hair before and I if you
if you don't know I'm transgender um
doesn't correct um and I have cancer
that is super incorrect and I'll get to
that in just a second um and the cancer
is not bad but it can be treat
but when I started at you that's where
it stops is coming your hair coming out
your hair was helping me through
everything and I know you u t sound
crazy but it helped me and I just want
to say thank you
my whole thing is this I don't know who
this person is by a fucking longshot and
this isn't the first time that this has
happened this happens all the fucking
time
and luckily diamond version here was
smart to text me the bullshit that they
received because then I can let them
know one this is not me - they sent it
from an Instagram account they said they
didn't have Instagram but yet they said
they sent it from you send an Instagram
account I mean an Instagram message
through Instagram saying you don't have
one it's not Malibu dog face for 3yz now
I don't know who this idiot is I don't
know who this just this is the shit that
a lot of us deal with on a regular basis
because people are so thirsty over here
and a lot of companies you're stealing
from these companies you are being
dishonest with these companies and then
these companies are hitting me back or a
lot of other um you know other gurus
back saying well we sent you here and
I'm like okay well if you sent me here
that's your fault because I have all my
booking information within my eat me in
my bio of my Instagram page for a good
reason my Instagram page is also listed
on my youtube bio account so therefore
if you didn't hit either one of those up
then it really didn't make any sense for
you as a company to send out here I get
an email at least once a week from a
company stating that they sent me here
and now they're waiting for they're
reviewing for their review and it's been
over two months and they still haven't
got a review and I'm not replying so
then they decide to hit me up on
Instagram which is very funny because
that's not exactly that's not where you
originally was contacted via anything
plus I don't do Instagram I mean
business Instagram anyway so that's
already wrong so you got an email from a
email address that wasn't listed in my
bio but you emailed me from the one in
my body to tell you tell me that you
received a review from me but I haven't
did it yet I understand how people sit
back and be this is honest over hair
it's fucking hair and you can't get your
ass up and go to work to buy proper
bundles then I don't know what the fuck
to tell you but it's very epistles me
off because not only are you stating
something that is not true which is I'm
not transgender and I
discussed that already and trust me I
love all my people from the transgender
community it's just not me everybody
wants to put me in a box and say because
I look a certain way and I do something
I'm supposed to be something it's like
dude I just like the fucking have fun
okay if a girl can wear basketball
shorts because she just want to be Lant
longeing that day then I have every
fucking right to wear a dress a skirt
some eyelashes and a weave down to my
ankles because I feel like and I'll have
to conform and say that I'm this because
I look like this this just we're not
gonna do that
so if you feel away I don't know I
really don't know what to tell you
and you're saying that I have cancer
which is already one not true and to
there people out here who are going
through that on a regular basis that's
very difficult and hard for them and you
said in your wack low life thirsty-ass
lying on me I don't put that on me I
don't want that like are you serious and
saying that I have this in and pretty
much in so many words you said I do have
cancer but it's not the back line it can
be treated like how much tends to do
where are you from who are you
eventually me and this person because I
have a feeling that all these accounts
that are popping up is from this one
particular person if it's enough it's
not then it's multiple people that are
doing this and it's making it's
difficult and it's pissing me off
because it's like you're using my name
for something that's very fraudulent and
it's like when people start lying on
your name is not cool so if any company
that's watching is one I do not contact
companies whatsoever in regards to any
reviews I am backed up to February of
next year in reviews so therefore there
should be no reason where you should be
getting an email from me or anybody
saying it on me that I'm trying to do
review at any time but especially now um
it's just very disheartening and
annoying for this to be like what people
do I just don't like that people do this
and they think that it's okay and then
you get an attitude win we always know
but you get a bit snappy in the comments
because people are asking us the same
thing or did you do this or did you do
that it's like when people hear be able
say did you review for this company I
have an entire channel dedicated to
reviews and all the other stuff that I
do so before you ask somebody a question
about did they do something
check the upload history and that will
answer your question it takes less time
to do that didn't work for me to exit
questioning for you to get an answer and
it's not me being a bitch but common
sense just come on out people like it's
not that difficult to do something so
simple like ever so for me it's again
it's a bit annoying and it just gets on
my nerves like it's something that I
just can't do it I'm just up to here
with it yeah I don't know I just at this
point I don't know what to do with the
situation but I just want to put this
video out to say that no I'm not
emailing companies no that's not me
I may not be the spelling champ of the
of the century but I definitely tell you
I didn't write that shit my punctuation
is pretty okay so I don't know who that
person is but I'm sure you're watching
and I just want to let you know I cannot
wait to the day that I see you cuz I
will it officially is gonna come out
somebody's IP address can be tracked and
I'm eventually see you I just want you
let you know that I'm gonna say every
motherfucking thing that I feel because
this right here is like the lowest of
the low when you take somebody else's
name and you lie on their name to try to
get free hair you're not trying to get
health coverage you're turn out trying
to get health benefits and then on top
of all of that you sit back and you
write a story
I've never reviewed for you I review for
them twice so how much that's already a
red flag then on top of that you're lazy
if you're going to lie be fucking
consistent in your life but you're
fucking lazy so you're gonna lie on me
then you're gonna be lazy about and just
make up a story and I'm sure they done
this with a lot of other gurus too i'm
because i we have conversations y'all
may not know we know each other y'all
may not know we cool but we have
conversations about the same shit that
we go through and this is a common
occurrence in the beauty community not
even just with our hair it's with makeup
too so you have people lying to these
big companies that they made they you
know saying oh I'm this person I'm that
person and I want to work with you
nobody has time for that nobody has time
for that and I think it's extremely wack
for anybody to really sit and think that
that's going to be okay to do like
bullshit 101 I'm not doing so I just
want to get that off my back I'm quite
over this situation if you see anything
suspicious like that make sure you tag
me on Instagram or DME or something and
let me know because I would love to get
them reported and taken down because I'm
just over being peoples weigh in and
they're come up because they want to be
lazy and they don't fucking want to do
what they're supposed to do and they
want to cheat companies out of money
we're just not going to do that don't
you agree Ritchie do not you know see
they so quiet they overeat boom I'm
fucking dinner so I'll toss you out of
my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
