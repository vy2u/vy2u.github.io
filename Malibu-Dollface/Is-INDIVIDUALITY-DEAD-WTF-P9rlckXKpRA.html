and so long and I know you guys miss
these because see I'm starting to miss
them now so this one is gonna be about
individuality and the reason why I
wanted to talk about this because a
friend of mine just had a baby
congratulations to you boo you watch and
I know and she and her husband decided
not to name their son a junior and she
did this after she had a conversation
with me
well we but we all three of us had a
conversation I ain't got nothing to do
with the baby but we just had a general
conversation and I was saying the reason
why I don't feel that naming your child
a junior works is because it does not
give a child a chance to be an
individual straight out the room you
basically being you playing second third
fifth seventh fiddle to somebody else
and I understand some people do that
because they paying tribute to somebody
or it's a legacy they want to you know
create or keep or whatever the situation
is but I personally feel and like I told
her I personally feel like how is a
mother how as a parent do you tell your
child you need to go out there be who
you are be an individual but you are
James Henry the seventh that means that
you are now following the footsteps or
you are now basically perpetuating a
legacy that you have to upkeep now of
someone else you don't have a chance so
if you come from a line of doctors
everybody now is basically told they
have to be a doctor if you want to go
out and be a rockstar that's not an
option no more so my whole thing is the
generation that we have now too many
parents are telling their kids you need
to be the next Obama you need to be the
next Diddy you need to be the next bitch
you need to be the next that when
they're not you're not encouraging your
kids to be the first them and just
because that is not what you feel is
necessary does not mean that it's
incorrect and I feel like when you start
to name your kids things like Junior
then basically Junior means
meaning me of me and I feel like it's
really for guys cuz she she has a sister
and she told me how to talk about this
okay she has a sister and her sister
wanted to name her daughter or junior of
her and everybody was so against that
they were like no that is stupid women
don't do that like it just very like the
 so I'm July how do you think it's
okay for a guy but it's not okay for a
girl when when dudes are born and they
have fathers that get for the most part
they get their father's last name so
whether you're junior or not you're
still keeping the legacy alive because
you carry that last name so not to say
that because you do end up being a
junior that you can't be in an
individual that's not what I'm saying
cuz that's stupid
you choose your destiny but when you're
stole from a little boy that well you
know your grandfather was a great
historian so you need to be that you
need to upkeep this family's legacy you
need to do that that's not really its it
doesn't allow you to grow as a person
it doesn't allow you to be who you are
because you're so stagnant and basically
pressed to be what your family wants you
to be and we have to get out of that
okay let's just go and get out of that
because the thing that I don't
understand is that there are grown-ass
people and I tell you grown who's still
listen to what their mothers have to say
and don't get me wrong this is not no
okay
the meat just disclaimer I'm talking to
the people who are 18 and over here so
if you were 17 and younger do not go to
your mom and say Dollface told me to say
this cuz I did not miss Williams I
didn't say that you so I am 26 years old
okay I don't answer to no one
if somebody asked me where I'm going and
I don't feel like answer then I'm just
simply not gonna answer I have that
right to do so
and not it's not even in a disrespectful
way it's an I'm grown and I do what I
wanna do talk but I'm growing I pay my
bills I'm grown I pay for my gas I'm
growing this is my car type of situation
I'm growing ain't nobody help me type of
situation so I don't understand that if
you are my age a little bit younger if
you are 18 years or older and you still
allowing your mother your mother to
take if you're gonna be an individual or
not that's a problem that's an issue
that you need to take it with yourself
because here's the thing at what point
are you gonna get the balls or the
vagina lips to be frank to stand up to
this person until you tell them this is
what I want to do well my mother doesn't
think that I should it's not about what
some other things it is not because at
the end of the day you have your life
and a today she didn't live to us so why
are you allowing her to make decisions
for you you don't make decisions for her
you don't cause she doesn't call you and
consult you when she decides she wants
to go to bingo she doesn't call you and
tell you oh I think I'm going No she
does what the she wants to do so I
don't understand why you don't do that
either it should never be that when I
get to when I got to a certain age I
could give a damn with my mom and think
about anything that I do because if she
does not like it that's her personal
business that's her personal vibe she
has to deal with it has nothing to do
it's not gonna stop me because she
doesn't console me and she doesn't call
me and I don't want her to when she
makes decisions and she does things cuz
there's a lot of things that I could run
down about her that I don't like that
she does but why that's her and I'll
meet and with two different adults and
it's still a respect thing because of
the simple fact that I love her and I
care about her but it does not change
the fact that I'm still gonna do what
the hell that I want to do and y'all
gotta learn and you can't be as old as
you are out here sleeping with this
person doing this but when it comes down
to your career and what you want to do
with yourself you want to go can so
mommy you wanna go get so daddy because
you don't know what to do your
priorities are up you're not
allowing yourself to grow and be able to
be that grown adult who makes their own
decisions about how you gonna handle a B
C and D you need to know how to do that
you don't need to call your momma every
five minutes I dated someone let me just
tell y'all about this I dated this dude
and his mother I don't want to be rude
right now but his mama was a lazy one
and she didn't want to work and all the
responsibilities fell on him or she fell
on her ass and it caused a rift in our
relationship because he is now her
husband you know it's like a lot of
women today their their kids are their
husbands that's why they're out here
naming them juniors and because
they don't want them to be the man that
the daddy either is
it he locked the up and he getting
beat or whatever the circumstance may
possibly be you don't see these men out
here trying to grow you don't see these
little girls turning into women because
they have no identities of their own
they see their mother go out here strip
to make a living and then when they get
older their mother is not teaching them
this is not what you're supposed to do I
did this because I had to do it but let
me try to because I stripped and because
I did this I tried to me give you a
better life so you would have to do this
but this is not it it's holes out here
in a 40 still stripping they daughters
just turned 18 they got them first thing
smoking on a pole that's not a great
example are you trying to you have them
being just like you you should always
want your child to be better than you
that is what you do I don't want my
child to be like me
I want him or her or both of them to be
better than me and that's the example
that I'm trying to set I don't want them
to be just like me because they're mean
there's no progression when somebody's
just like you there is no progression
they are a mini-me there are a clone so
your identity needs to come from you we
have our own lives our own mounts our
own thoughts and our own ways of doing
things for a reason we are all
individuals for a reason so we need to
learn how to do it
y'all be out here trying to be everybody
 else or this bitches out here
twerking so much work he out here
smoking a hookah so I'm gonna smoke the
hookah she out here sleeping with him so
I'm gonna go sleep that's what y'all do
instead of saying you know what bitch
you can have that I don't want that boy
cuz you can smoke it yourself I'm gonna
go my business and I'm
gonna figure out what I want to do with
myself that's how you become an
individual you don't become an
individual by trying to do what
everybody else is doing and it's sad
because a lot of you guys don't know any
better because of how you taught at home
you start off basically being someone
else well heck gone gone Thomas
Jefferson at seven you better gone cuz
you know your granddaddy used to play
basketball and you just as tall as him
you should play basketball you should
try to be more like the boy down the
street you should try to be like more
like Obama
why can't Jeffery just simply be Jeffery
with it why is that such a far-fetched
thing to tell your child why is that a
far-fetched thing to do why is why can't
you look in a mirror and love yourself
and say you know what I am who the
I am and it is with the it is why
is that so hard for you today and
grown-ass people for that matter to do
because judging from these these
terminology that Sean using and these
trending topics out here that y'all
wanna just just get all gung-ho for the
talent show and sound stupid ignorant
uneducated y'all following a trend yeah
I following each other cuz y'all don't
know where to go y'all have no direction
and I'm not saying everybody but it's
some of y'all is it sad but it some of
you and it has to be said because I see
it all the time there are people I pull
so much inspiration from it's not even
funny my hair is a Leo right now my
necklace maybe kim kardashian my hoodie
maybe Cassie but it's still me at the
end of the day you always gonna pull
from somebody you're always gonna see
something that you like you're always
gonna see something that you wanting
emulating you like but it doesn't mean
that you have to become there and that's
the problem y'all take it too far y'all
go from I like her dress so I wanna look
just like her I'm gonna do exactly what
she did because I don't know what to do
with myself
meeting my mother and my father and
whoever raised me didn't teach me how to
be me so a lot of y'all don't even like
yourself because y'all don't know y'all
self so I I feel a sense of it is of
sadness to see young kids with so much
potential to do so much who don't even
take the opportunity to sit back and say
what do I want what do I want then you
become grown-ass adults you don't know
who you are and now you run into your
mom and you let her mold you into which
she wants you to be so then you end up
at a dead-end ass job doing some
 that you didn't want to do in the
first place because your mother
suggested it and that's the way that she
went because you to know what to do what
you like and I think a lot of this has
to do with the amount of growth and the
amount of the amount of growth but also
the amount of self work you see with
yourself because I feel like I can do
anything in a world there's nothing I
can't do but I didn't get that from my
mom I didn't get that from my dad I
didn't get that from nobody but myself
and I had to go to things and I think me
being gay
me going through the things that I've
been through and being discriminated
against and gentlemen said that all
helped mold me so I used basically the
negativity that was my life and I turned
it into a positive to basically create
Who I am and that's missing you that's
when you turn lemons into lemonade
because at the end of the day nobody can
tell me about myself not my mother
not my grandmother nobody can tell me
anything about me but me because I know
myself better than anyone it's people
out here who don't know their self but I
can read you like a book
that's a problem because if people take
advantage of you they'd do to you
they make sure that they get they they
get you like this we're good like this
and sometimes it's family who do that
and it will work your ass until there's
nothing left because you don't know what
you're doing wrong you don't know that
what you're doing or what you're saying
or what you're into is wrong or it's not
you you're just rolling with the punches
and you're dealing with what is this and
hopefully one day something that come to
fruition and I'm good so y'all gotta get
about it at this 2014 and there's too
much out here for y'all to be doing and
I made a comment on Twitter where I said
and I didn't mean to generalize but it
was a general statement but I said it
seems like everyday dude is a hair
stylist a stylist or makeup artist when
are we gonna learn how to get out of
these stereotypes and start to do things
better and that's not to say that being
those things are wrong at all and I can
tell who's genuinely in it because they
love it and who's doing it because I
think someone else do it and that is the
difference you got to start doing
that you want to do just because you are
a pretty man does not mean that you have
to do hair and makeup just because you
are a butch woman doesn't that mean you
have to be a mechanic and drive a truck
okay you can do do you like to do
I love aliens I want about aliens
all day I don't just sit back and be
collecting Barbies I do other
they're things that interests me and I
have no shame in my game with saying
that to somebody because I am Who I am
and me I'm not a one-dimensional person
and everybody seems to be
one-dimensional you only do one thing
you only facet it in one lane and that
is a problem you guys need to open up
your ears open up your eyes if you loved
if you want to fly kites and do hair do
that if you
a drag race and do drag race then you do
that you know I'm saying it's all up to
you the world is so vast so big in so
much variety and you guys are not taking
full advantage of it so you got to do it
so I hope this helps somebody and and
again just remember who you are and what
you want to do everybody else
everybody else you don't know how to
 they're getting a what they
doing and if they even want to sleep
happy with a self at night so I will
talk to y'all later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
