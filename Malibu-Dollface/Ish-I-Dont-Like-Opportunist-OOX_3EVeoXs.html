topic this I don't know why this
sweatshirt makes me look so big I
promise I'm not fat
but I just look large um but today's
topic is um when did money equal
disrespect you know um for some reason I
don't know if it's always been like this
but I'm going to speak for the
generation that I come from it seems as
if money is no longer the root of all
evil when really money is just currency
bitch that's people that's the root of
all of them to say no um but why is it
that people who have money can get away
with whatever but if you go broke bitch
you gots to sit down and have several
seats what is that about
now I made a comment and some of you
guys are gonna hate me after this I
don't care but I'm just letting you know
I made a comment that I said that Oprah
was ugly okay um
some people think she's beautiful I
personally don't think Oprah is cute at
all but the same for me in everybody
else you know I'm saying that's just my
personal opinion I'm entitled today
right okay so somebody said yeah who
cares cuz she got money she paid though
when do we start talking about her money
we know her money's not making her cute
games in late for you maybe because
that's what you're interested in but I'm
talking about just looks in general as
far as a person as a whole I'm not
talking about her money so why is it
every time you say something about
somebody everybody wants to result back
to what somebody has well she got three
Bentley's or my cousin says she didn't
like Nicki Minaj and her friend gonna
turn around and say well she paid and
she got money to look stupid y'all
bitches out here looking stupid for
nothing
bitch it don't matter if you should get
paid to look stupid it don't matter
bitch this could be the next bitch like
why is there always a defense well she
got money though she got me like money
is not whatever and I see a lot
people like I made a comment on Twitter
and I said I couldn't be someone's
assistant and I already know the reason
why I couldn't be someone's assistant
because one of my attitude is too bad to
my organization skills or too bad three
my irritation level is too bad so I
really can't do many things when I have
to do it with someone else that doesn't
work so somebody was like whoa you know
Venus's a lot of people who are
assistants like Diddy and me and he went
from actually he was an A&amp;amp;R but um
basically helping someone else has got
somebody somewhere else that's fine I'm
not gonna I'm not saying it's anything
wrong with that but I personally don't
feel that me hoping someone else's
dreams come true is gonna help me in the
long run I don't see it if I want to be
the star then why am I playing back why
am I in the background
no that's figuratively speaking if in
real life if I wanted to be an actor
like for throwing of course I would have
to be an extra first and then unless I
knew somebody you know I'm working way
up that makes sense but just to be an
assistant and once somebody racketing
has somebody disrespect me and call me
on my name only because they have money
in there their ranking is higher than
mine I just can't do that I was raised
like that like it's one thing when you
have a job and you have to do it but
it's another thing when you have you're
working for someone and you're basically
someone's lap dog and a lot of y'all do
it there's a lot of people that I know
or I have seen that are either on
YouTube off YouTube friends with
somebody cool with somebody else that
give becomes friends with celebrities
and they become a lap dog and whenever
that person calls they come running but
it's like do you want to be the star or
do you always want to be the friend of
the sister of the cousin of the Twitter
friend of do you want to be the bitch
that's in it like what the is it
just me
like y'all gotta y'all gotta find y'all
worth at some point in time got got to
do it cuz it makes no sense
you should never want to play backup to
nobody nobody wants to be Kelly and
Michelle everybody wants to be Beyonce
that's what I'm saying so
why are bitches get mad at me because of
what I said that's the truth though
unless that's what you want to do and
that's it bitch knock yourself out if
that's what you really want to close in
the back and just make them place it
will be in the background bitch be all
means you do what you got to do I'm not
that bitch so I'm not about to run and
kiss somebody ass in order to gain
something from me you know I'm saying
like I can get my own my own way if
I'm friends with you I'm friends with
you because we cool I'm not friends with
you because of what I can gain because
of what you have money and if you go to
the Grammys or if you become an a-list
actor then I'm gonna be right there like
you know bitch I've been here for the
longest time no all that I don't
know you like that that's why I don't
 with a lot of people because a lot
of people's mindsets are like that
everybody wants fame and fortune
everybody doesn't want to work for the
fame and fortune everybody wants
everybody to just hand in something I'm
a cute bitch everybody bitch you being
cute anger you do with your talent
there's a lot of cute bitches out here
trying to sing dance krump rap model and
still got the ass of a
Instagram airbrushed of a storm and
ain't nobody checking for you cuz you
can't do outs so but then you think
because your friend got money that's
gonna get you where you want to go you
got to be something in life you have to
want to be more you have to reach for
the stars you can't go around saying
well I'm not gonna do this cuz I ain't
gonna get it or I'm not gonna say this
cuz I'm not gonna get it like I don't
like people like that either they got
negative attitudes that they speak
negative into the air I don't I'm
that type of bitch don't do that
with me well you made a bitch imma get
it and if I don't get it I'm gonna get
the next one
we're gonna talk about what ain't gonna
happen cuz I'm not here for that so my
other thing is stop giving people credit
who don't deserve credit or where the
credit is not meant to be placed if it's
not necessary only because they have
money that's stupid
and as childish and as materialistic
everybody want to look at what somebody
have whoa it's like people hit me yeah
well can you do this and can't you do
that and I don't even talk to these
people
it's like how are you asking me for
something when you and I are not even
friends
we don't speak yeah I don't have your
number
we don't kick it like this so while you
asked me to do a favor as I was due to a
friend because you're looking at numbers
you're looking at with someone's
position is and you're like I can
capitalize off that if we cool I've seen
all this people do it to me all the time
and I spit back in our giggle and they
ask me for stuff and I don't reply and
if it's happen to you then you know why
I mean that has anything to do with me
I've worked really hard to get to the
position where I am and the last thing
I'm gonna do is that who
don't deserve eat off my hard work and
that should be for you too it does not
work is one thing to help somebody is
another thing to carry somebody I'm not
carrying nobody's business
nobody's blog nobody's website nobody's
clothing line I'm not carrying cuz
ain't nobody carried my and nobody
should carry my and that's the
point I'm trying to make here when you
get to a certain point you shouldn't be
trying to leech off nobody because of
things that they work for you don't
saying but you should have something of
your own that you can go for don't be
the next bitch black dog be your own
 star bitch you need to
star in your own movie stop being a
co-star to this bitch that don't work so
it depends on the person cuz everybody
ain't me for this and everybody
thinks that fame and fortune comes with
all these perks I'm spitting on YouTube
for like three years and things are just
starting to work out for me
things are good and I've worked hard for
it though I'm not just been sitting here
doing nothing for nothing like I've
worked hard for the in the
opportunities that I'm getting now you
know I'm saying and I appreciate it I'm
not one of those people they're gonna
sit up and throw like bodies by
that give me this give me that and if
it's not well thought out if it's not
gonna be of quality I'm not gonna do it
and that's just not just materialistic
 but that's just me as a person you
guys are not gonna catch me certain
places with certain people doing certain
things because
I don't want to be looked at in a
certain way and I don't go about what
people think of me but I go about what I
think of myself so there are a lot of
people who are willing to do whatever to
get whatever I'm not that one
so maybe my rise may be a little slower
than the next bitch but understand that
when I get to where I'm going I can sit
back and rest my feet and know for a
fact that I did everything that I was
supposed to do the correct way and I
ain't got no regrets and
no shame on my name for that where
 can come back years later
and blackmail me for that I've done
years ago because it always happens so
yeah I mean I guess is it depends on the
person and it depends on the situation
but for me as a person no I I just I'm
not I'm not and people ask me that all
the time
you should be verified on Twitter you
should you do that probably sure if I
talked to the right people I can do it
but everybody wants something and I'm
not willing to give up everything and
it's not just sex it's not just this
it's other
so stop respecting people because of
their dollar amount and start respecting
people for who they are and what they've
done for the better good okay you are
here respecting bitches hoes bitches
used to be hoes niggas you used to be
drug dealers and I'm not saying it there
any less of people because of that but
there are other people that you can look
at who do the exact same thing you
gotten where they want but they did it
with hard work and perseverance just
start to look at your role models and
start look at the that you
really really think that are doing
something cuz a lot of these people that
y'all love and care so much about our
soul miserable they don't want
to get up in the morning they don't want
to do they wish they were still on
a corner selling mixtapes because it's
much better than the that's
really going on I'm just saying so yeah
I love that um I'm about to start a new
t-shirt line I'm like my little kids
that I'm working on a stuff now so those
who know listen listen I told y'all when
I did Malibu kids it was a limited time
only
get down so y'all are hitting me up six
months seven months later told y'all
when everything sells out is over it's
over doing so people wanted to wait is
seven months you don't say I don't know
but for those who wanted to wait that
long
don't worry I got your back I got a new
line coming out with some old designs
from Malibu kids like you know the crew
necks and stuff like that in an t-shirts
and stuff that you guys wanted so don't
worry this is gonna be a little longer
it's not gonna be forever
it's gonna be a little longer than
Malibu kids was um like I said it's a
new name is not Malibu kids anymore um
and yeah why not uh whiskey girls we're
still doing that the next episode is we
tape a thing in two weeks
I think sure yeah um and I have a
project that I've been like passionately
working on to present to you guys um but
the only reason why I haven't did it
because everything hasn't been right
there I'm a perfectionist so it has to
be correct in order for me to present it
to you cuz I'm not trying for sanjana

like for real but it's for something
that I really have dreamt of since a kid
and something that you guys keep saying
that I need and if I had one you would
buy it that's all i'ma say you can't
discuss amongst yourselves at the bottom
what that is and we go from there
so yeah I'm about to go give me
something to eat and then I must go home
cuz I'm tired I've been out like since
early this morning
so yeah and once I go home um and yeah I
will catch ah later later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
