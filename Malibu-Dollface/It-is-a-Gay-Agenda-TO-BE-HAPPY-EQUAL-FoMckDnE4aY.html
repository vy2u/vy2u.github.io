something boiling in my bones I have to
speak about Italian so rapidly they
will-they the public was outraged what
he said about the new mosquito Barbie
commercial which features a little boy
as little Jeremy Scott and he said them
you know Barbie is so fierce and parents
some parents um there's kind of a 50/50
split about this some parents thought
that it was great that Mattel after 54
years of being in the business with
Barbie they finally featured a little
boy and an egg so it was for these dolls
it was for the relief of these are
mosquito Barbie Barbie dolls by the one
and only mr. a Jeremy Scott and I got
three of these I have two black girls
and I have one Caucasian Barbie and they
have the old school 90s Barbie face
molds there are all the same I got hook
up cuz my girl over at mosquito called
me like yeah so those go now you guys
know I have to UM the reason why I
brought three of them is because the
clothes the extra clothes and things I
didn't want to open East because my
dollars actually almost finished and he
needs some mosquito I mean that's only
right right um but I do want to talk
about how people are some people are
saying there's a gay agenda that we are
trying in the press and the people in
the world and the fish in the grass is
trying to press upon people especially
with everything from Caitlyn Jenner
coming out to just a whole lot of things
that are having gay friendly a lot of
people have been very uncomfortable
about that and trust me as a gay man I
understand this and I deal with this on
a regular basis and I feel like a lot of
times adults make things that are not
supposed to be the certain ways into
something that it's not so pretty much
you're finding it tick
and what I mean by that is the look when
the commercial was representing
something that as a child I always
wanted to be a part of I was a little
boy who played with Barbies clearly um
every little boy doesn't every little
gay boy didn't play with Barbies but I
know I did and clearly Jeremy Scott did
too and yes this thing Ennis affinity
towards Barbie that he just loves and I
don't see anything wrong with that what
I do find an issue with is that people
are always yelling about what's not good
for the kids when it's nothing that of
any harm in my personal opinion I don't
have children I only have cousins nieces
and nephews stuff like that and what I
will say is when I was a child there
were things that adults would make a big
deal over that wasn't a big deal and
what people are not understanding is it
is 2015 okay if you are still living in
1902 you're the one with the issue and
the problem because you're not growing
what people don't understand is that if
I had to was if I was able to see
something like what that little boy did
in that commercial
I cried watching that because it
represents something that I never had as
a kid and again there's a lot of things
that people will watch um a lot of women
who have been through miscarriages and
an abortion and cry when they go to like
Toys R Babies R Us or whatever the
situation is because it reminds them of
something that they don't have and it
kind of hits a nerve it doesn't do
anything for me but I'm not saying that
if a woman feels that way or they
represent or they see something or they
have support groups with stuff like that
and stuff like that that it's wrong
because I personally haven't went
through it a lot of these women it's
written and I'm just gonna say what it
is a lot of these is a little hood ones
they have something to say but them it's
not good for kids to be seeing that
like that on TV what's not good for your
children it was not healthy for your
children is the fact that he called your
boyfriend his uncle that's not conducive
for your children's growth pattern okay
still waiting up Virginia's we're his
daddy to come back from the
store bitch that is a problem that is an
issue the fact that you've been on the
county since you had your kids and your
child is going on 18 and now you don't
know what you gonna do next year
that there lies a problem with other
people doing their other life and how a
company chooses to represent something
that they feel passionate about because
you have to understand Mattel is a brand
okay and a majority of the people who
buy Barbies are men believe what you
want they're men and a majority of them
are gaming so no this that was something
that a lot of us a lot of us Barbie
collectors really had a moment with and
a lot of people wanted to come and be
negative and tear it down there's this
gay agenda I stopped watching Empire
because this I stopped watching this
listen honey Empire it's not for
everybody okay
but they did tell a story that a lot of
us have been through okay I've never
been thrown in the trash however it's
been something close to it okay I've
been through a lot there's a lot of
people from my community have been
through a lot of that so to see that
pushed into people's faces to see that
we don't do to we have issues too
don't try to dim my life because you can
uncomfortable how bright I shine that's
that's a problem for me that's a big
issue for me and again I don't accept
I don't ask nobody to accept Who I am
you know have to with me on a
regular basis I don't actually what your
personal feelings are about me because I
really don't give a but what I do
and would like to appreciate is and
there are people in the world who are
making strides for a particular
community don't tell knock them down
because you don't like it you feel
uncomfortable with it cool there's a lot
of that I see on TV all the time
and people are yelling well it's not
good for the children to see this well
as a child I knew that I was gay from a
very small child so you're trying to
tell me there was a straight agenda if
you want to be just 100 with it I didn't
want to see a man in a woman case
because I didn't represent what I did
but did I get mad about it no am i
writing letters about it no and I don't
even mean comments about it no that's
that's how the world is the world is a
moustache of all types of and it's
gonna be that you like and you
do not like but at the end of the day
when you spew hate and disrespect for a
particular group of
for when your group of people have been
in this very same seat it just makes you
look ungrateful and uneducated about the
history and what you come from because
at the end of the day I will never take
nobody's struggle away from them however
you got your on where you come from
that's your business
but I am not about to sit up here and
try to make you feel bad about something
that you really feel passionately about
and I feel like somebody a group of
people had an issue with that
just case in point there was an issue of
American girl that came out recently and
it was a young African American girl who
was adopted by two Caucasian males and
when they found out that she has three
little brothers in foster care they
adopted them too they did a story on her
in the magazine and the Million Moms
decided that they want us to go in and
say that this is a problem and this is
pushing the gay agenda down people's
throats and children shouldn't see this
listen your children are gonna go to
school and your children are going to be
one of two people people who are
accepting our people are not okay
because I'm gonna tell you something
when I was in school I was taught
everything but my name by mother
who didn't understand who I was because
their parents were not educating them on
is more than just straight in this world
there's more than just white or black or
Mexican in this world and that's where
you parents have to come in and actually
educate your children because they are
reflection of you if they're of you're
acting a mess that means
that everyone your ass is acting a
 mess too so therefore you are
only an extension of your child and your
child is an extension of you so if y'all
both is stupid as a the
world is gonna see that and you're gonna
make it very difficult because one day
what you felt understand and realize is
somebody who is gay maybe your boss
they don't even about how you
personally feel about them but this is
why people don't move up in the world
and they cannot go forward in the world
they let personal become business
 and then you up and you don't
have anything because you're like who
your boss sleep would have nothing to do
with you because I can guarantee your
boss them you will who you
it like they don't care are you doing
your job it's that simple there's a lot
of people who dislike me because of
videos like this because I tell the
truth or you don't like it or I have a
child right
it doesn't matter because if you're not
teaching your children tolerance they're
gonna have a very very hard ass life
that's why a lot of times when I see
kids end up in very bad situations I
start to look at the reflection of the
parent the parent want to say that my
child is a victim my time is this and
nine times out of ten they are but that
little 1% is because you didn't do what
the you were supposed to do and you
want everybody to be the victim now you
want everybody to say well my child is
he he he didn't do anything
he did a lot to a lot of
and what he got is what he got because
that's the situation that he was in you
know so my mother and father and granny
and grandparents taught me what to do
and what not to do okay
I am better than no one else in this
world I have to make sure that I am is
just as humble to her as I would be to
him because at the end of the day when
you walk away from a conversation with
me I want you to understand who I am as
a person not this okay not who I sleep
with that night because that's none of
your business
and I don't care about that but who I am
as an individual as a whole I want
people to start to understand that
listen and we both get shot today we
welcome end up in during the same pain
because you and I are no different in
here is you let this determine if you
 with somebody are you done it is a
lot of I don't like there's a lot
of I don't understand there's a lot
of I don't respect but my
opinion is not the end-all be-all and
I'm not going to sit up here and judge
somebody else about what their truth is
period if you don't like it don't
comment and that's it sometimes the best
things not saying are the greatest
things ever cuz what the you don't
say to somebody hey it's what it is but
sometimes what you do say can leave a
lasting and scarring impression on
people so if you didn't like the little
boy in a mosquito commercial that's fine
because there was two other girls in the
commercial too you know the crazy thing
about it is everybody's always yelling
about how Barbie does not represent the
african-american community there was a
beautiful natural black little girl in
that commercial and you know what they
complained about the Caucasian little
boy who just simply was being himself in
this world in this society where we
you can't whip the lose cuz wherever you
product resolution you're gonna always
be another problem you know so again
start to think about how you want to be
treated by people and start to
understand you don't have to understand
and you don't have to accept anything
there's a lot of people from the trans
community who hate Caitlyn Jenner
there's a lot of people who think she's
doing a courageous thing and they call
her sister whatever I don't care at the
end of the day just make sure that
you're respecting people like you want
to be respected and again back to the
mosquito commercial that is a child that
is a child who got a job and did a hell
of a job to represent something that I
don't even think he understands the
cultural impact that's gonna have in the
next 50 years so watch what you say and
watch how you say it about children
that's the problem
everybody wants to be so big and bad and
heartless over the computer remember one
day these can be your children and I
know y'all don't like nobody talking
 about cha kids so I will catch all
in the next one but think about what the
 I just saying because for real for
real
she was getting out of hand and
shout-out to peers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
