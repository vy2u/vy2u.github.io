video as yet but if you guys are
watching it I've come up with some
concoction okay um the review for this
hair which is my eyewear glam hair and
34 inches swing straight should already
be a um if you're watching this so go to
my channel click it or I'll link it
below so this video is going to be about
people who apparently don't look don't
think that reacting in the way in which
they do they don't is appropriate for
you and what I mean by that is you'll
receive you guys know I'm a big of you
are of the good ol shade room right oh
you see celebrities go at it or
celebrities going fans you know I'm
saying people who've been talking
I'm like why would you lower yourself to
do this um when you have this is that
the other so because II no one is above
getting talked about it nobody is above
getting in feelings hurt and I just hate
that people walk around and they just
have this oh it wasn't necessary you
don't even shut up but that she gets up
shut up just shut up
like I don't like that you cuz all of us
we have our breaking point the title
your breaking point so we all have our
breaking point whether it be
relationships family jobs traffic it
don't matter you have your moments where
you completely just lose your and
you go off on the closest person to you
because you go away okay and I just hate
when I see certain things happen or I do
certain things and I replied to them and
people just be you know it was so
unnecessary for you to did it or you
don't even pay them no mind is that the
other and I'm just thinking to myself
like you and your everyday life I'm sure
that there is something or a nerve that
somebody has hit where you just let the
whole world have it so shut that
 up that she gets on my nerves just
like every time I have a video it could
be a type of video I can be talking
about anything and then it'll be a
person you know you didn't have to do it
I don't know the I do and don't
have to do and I don't need a person
that I don't know like that trying to
tell me how to handle my anger I hate
that it listen the other day okay
Venis woman go off at the bank and she
went off because the woman in front of
her cut her and to me I would have just
I would brush it off because I was
having a good day that day I just got
some extra money I brought some shoes so
I was giriboy in show world but the lady
that cussed her out clearly was not
having one of my days and she went off
in the bank teller lady said that wasn't
even necessary and she said bitch you
don't know what I've been through and
don't tell me what is and what is not
necessary
so sometimes unsolicited as advice to
people about how they should handle
their situation is not I don't need that
when I see Tamar I'm going at certain
people I see em burros clap back at
somebody or whoever or the game get out
of hand I don't say you know that was so
intense there sometimes it is
unnecessary however I'm not going to
them out of handle his he could
have an off dates and he could found out
some key that got him in his feelings
and that's why I tell people you have to
be very mindful of how you talk to other
people because you don't know this is
what people like people pick and bully
people and then they end up shooting up
the whole job or the whole school and
you think why would warranted that and
said you don't know what's going on in
there like you won't believe in the
alone you know so it's like you have to
watch our mouths and watching things
that you say I have that issue a lot
with other people trying to tell me what
I should and I should not be doing but
the problem with that is none of these
people are around and I should be paying
my bills and I shouldn't be buying shoes
and I want to make the decision and then
I said oh I'll give you the money for
the shoes and you pay your bills no I do
the right responsible thing and pay my
bills but you're never there when
something is due you're only there when
you feel the need to add a unnecessary
ask comment that's why when I see people
go off if I do comment I'd be like get
that bitch don't know what she did
forget her like it's that's because
that's how you gonna that's how you
operate but I cannot stand a person to
tell me what I should have done and what
no you should look that sorry I think
you've been 114 years still with them so
there you go in ain't none of my
business right but I don't tell you that
because again
that's you that ain't me so we're gonna
let it be what it is but it's other
people who sit back and talk just they
sit in it's a bubble as if they're
perfect and they don't lose their cool
and they don't lose their because
they didn't you didn't have a situation
in way they thought you should there's a
lot of things I think other people
should do but I don't tell them that I
don't feel the need to say that
especially when it's a person who's a
stranger there's so many people I see on
YouTube
whose weaves look terrible I mean just
got off and I could say you're sewing it
in wrong it's not quite on correctly
it ain't flat at the top you need to fix
that but what does me saying is to a
perfect stranger that I don't know what
is it going to do it could help but at
the same time they didn't ask for my
life so I ain't give it it's that simple
now you ask me a question and you want
my honest to god opinion I'll give it to
you raw and uncut it's just what it is
you know but my point is never to be
spiteful or angry or disrespectful or
reason anyone but when people come and
meet off-the-cuff about stuff like that
especially if I'm in my feelings don't
is I the person getting ready to fight
and then you want to hold them back to
not do what you're gonna do sugar like
okay I'm not building your ass out um
but I just I just like that that's one
of the main things about social media
that hurts my soul and sometimes I just
mean it could be something that I'm just
laughing about or something that I
didn't really take that serious and then
let it be what it is case in point there
was a post that I put in it said people
look at my life and think that I'm lucky
but you guys have no idea how much I
prayed and and I put 100 and I put the
prayer hands oh it wasn't that post nor
button it was the other one I said
people look at everything the shoes my
car my hair everything that I have in
assuming that I'm kept by a dude I said
but I don't only think I'm keeping this
myself I do keep I don't you know see
that was pretty much what it is I have
everything I have because of me somebody
say
God listen unlike some other people and
however you you display your
spirituality of via social media is your
 business but I don't have to I
don't need to put a bible scripture at
the end of everything that i post okay
it is my personal faith with the lord
jesus christ and none of your damn
business okay so - for me to plant that
is that when a person has something and
they want to show you because they want
to see so you can know that they have it
it's like but people who actually have
things you don't do that you don't go
around saying I have skin we all got it
for the most part so you don't brag
about that cuz you have it
you only bragging because you want
somebody else to me it's that type of
situation
um where I just it feels like don't you
shut them up
like you you missed the whole point of
the post bitch you did and it's annoying
it's annoying when everybody wants to
try to be around you got the grammar
police
you got the whole police you got the
homophobic police they're all the people
on social media and you just think to
myself what is your life cos there's
something an interview recently that was
just so profound si si she said people
sit on the internet all day and judge
and just- she said people who do that
your spirit is jacked up and I believe
that is listen what I don't say it's for
the best
I know my mouth and I know I converse
about these feelings and I'm sure my
feelings have been hurt plenty of many
times however that's never my point and
I'm just not gonna do that
you never saying like I'm not about to
just be sitting up here going at people
for the sake of Lorna then like it's
back to me but some people sit on social
media and try to other people you don't
even hug it in kids that
you got you they don't Mitchell keeps on
even doing homework but you worried
about me and how I should handle my
and it's like shut the up if a
person was of all here in stock three
bitches in about because I'm bitch look
at her wrong that's her business
I'm not saying that it's right
understand let her handle her her
way and in him your anyway and then
you'll be okay
you give up saying so
want to little bit you know because
people people have a tendency to try to
get up under your skin and I know some
people just want attention y'all if
anybody knows I know I know better than
anybody some of these people don't have
friends sometimes picking fights is on
the way you can get somebody to call
your aspect or reply back to your ass so
I totally get that but sometimes people
don't understand if I pop off I'm not
popping off at everybody who talking
 I'm popping off because either I'm
having a bad day I'm sitting back
watching this bitch laughing and I'm
feeling the need like a bitch since you
feel like you that cute I'll make sure
you really gorgeous so it's little
situations like that I will pop back at
everybody but if I did that there will
be my business you get them saying and
you should let the haters land I'm say
okay but let it be you because if people
don't understand your position into the
in it trust and believe that that's why
I see people or that celebrities and
calling out their name I'll be like
y'all rude as now are I get
somebody going you do 11 your pop but
that is for entertainment purposes I
don't sell these peoples pages and write
the cruel that I say and I try to
censor that as well because there are
people and then you got feelings but it
is what it is but I don't go out of my
way you're talking people sit back on
Kim Kardashian and Justin Bieber's pages
and talk of your whore your this year it
is but you took out that time to write
the hoard you took out that time to
acknowledge the bag so therefore
you like something about them because
telling a person who knows their gated
their gain just lets me know that you
know that I'm gay and I think you should
I tell me something right now that's
what I think maybe not maybe I don't
know but you make yourself look real
suspect I cannot or is always the dumb
bitches this is a dude on my page I'd be
like or you could check my
profile bitch and it says that
clearance day in my hashtags
dummy you thought you did something huh
sit down bitch it's all but it's bitches
what kills me about all of it it's never
the pretty girls that do it it's never
the cute boys that do it it's always the
ashy ass dudes who sparked an EBT card
is just dry as a kitchen the
back of a ear stink and they
want to sit up there and talk about you
and what you got I got shoes worth more
shut the up I can buy your life
like for real
like if all you got is Who I am and
that's what you're trying to use against
me bitch
I don't have a problem who the I am
you have a problem turn it out
so yeah all that note I'm gonna go but I
did miss you guys and I'm doing I'm
promise I'm going to do more subject
videos as well as affecting my glitter
timberlands tutorial is definitely
coming up it's just been a minute
because I have it fixed and stuff but
trust me it is definitely coming you
