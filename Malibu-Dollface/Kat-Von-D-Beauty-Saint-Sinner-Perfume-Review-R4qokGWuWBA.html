fro pretty good so I do have it not a
tutorial I would review for this hair
which is more of a unisex look I didn't
wanted to have like a specific gender
but who doesn't love her like a curly
fro and it income like I've actually did
this myself so that would be in a
separate video but I asked you guys
yesterday on Instagram would you guys
like a review for the Kat Von D st. and
center of fragrance challenge and I got
no nose oh yes oh um decided to go ahead
and do this because one of these I am
obsessed with and one of them is it
reminds me of a fragrance that I've had
in the past so we're going to go ahead
when I got mine so just for you guys
that don't know I get a lot of PR from
honey beauty and everything that they
send me I always use I just haven't had
a chance to do like a tutorial or a
review on it because every time I think
I'm ready I get more stuff so as you
guys are looking when you click on this
video you're probably seen the cover for
it and I have the black and white here
well everything in that particular photo
I use Kat Von D beauty products except
for the shine on my black lips I'd use
mac lipglass with everything else I go
we use witches on my lips like
everything from our line I use in that
look that's why I use it and in return
for this so slow it through it okay so I
don't know and I doubt that these are
going to be sold in the stores like this
but if they are this is really amazing
but this has a lot of weight on it so
they look like this when you first
receive them these are like the
intricacy of the bottles are frequently
like the detail in these bottles are
amazing and I'm
bottle collector like I used like
Britney Spears fantasies I love those
bottles with the rhinestones on them
I love Gaga's like fluid I love the
little powder puffs with Ariana Grande's
re so I'm one for packaging and I must
say that I'm really impressed with how
this looks I'm going to check out the
center first so the center one looks
like this and it has this beautiful I
don't know what's calligraphy those I
think that is so wrong but these
definitely things okay I forgot what
this specifically is called so at the
top of this it says KVD and then the
bottle itself and the sprayer is
actually black as well and then you can
see all the products with them inside
and what this reminds me up honestly it
reminds me of when I'm thinking we'll
get tattoos which she is a tattoo artist
and it looks like a heart it looks like
a heart that has been broken or you can
see music just imagine it's red and then
the fluid would ring I'm working with
the Oh me call like st. Center in
between I don't know but I would I would
probably buy it so okay so this is the
one I like to leave and the reason why I
like it delete is because you got some
references for those who are our love
perfume from what I wear on a regular
basis to kind of get what I'm saying
here I like Paris's can-can I am a big
fan of like I said re by Ariana Grande I
like Britney fantasies anything that has
a very light smell to it I'm not one for
musk at all that's why I don't
personally as a dude I don't like to
wear a cold because most of cologne has
a very musky manly smell to it which
agent says it's not pleasant to my nose
I hate why diamonds I think why diamond
smells like trash juice and this has
musk in it but it's not a much that you
couldn't that's bad it's a must that you
get it especially was being compared
with the saints these are two opposites
now Britney Spears did something very
similar to this when she did see our
twisted fan
see where one side was the pink fantasy
and the other side was the blue fantasy
so it was represented in midnight
fantasy and you can mix them if you want
to that's kind of what this reminds me
of I will say I like this one more
because I'm personal like things that
were no musk in it I don't know what she
did with this but this has got to be one
of the best smelling fragrances I have
smelled in a long damn time guys okay
try to put any on today because I was
waiting for this but I usually like to
total it because it's not enough like I
said I'll be going all day okay now okay
I'm tasting it now
so the reason as you guys seen I'm
pretty heavy-handed when it comes to my
fragrances and that's another reason why
I like them to be light as opposed to
them being pretty much because if I
would have sprayed this much with this
one did with this one yeah I probably
would smell like straight strength you
know it would be rude like did you have
to put the whole bottle on so again
because I'll be out I like because it's
so light you want it to kind of stick
and I notice the difference between the
toilet and the perfume the perfume so
this one would be considered the perfume
okay so this one it would be stronger
than to play list if I believe that's
right um and you guys can't really tell
but these bottles are so freakin
intricate like she went in with the
detail for all of these like scent is
she went in with the intricacy of this
like this bottle is the max freaking
nificent in like the front it says KVD
at the top here and like these are
beautifully designed bottle but I just
want to go like this really good like
you know because I need this inner to
the same center she's gonna call me all
that did it
I brought a little wig and everything I
like this one more than I like this one
this one actually reminds me a lot of my
dog a black fluid
that's what that reminds me of and this
is actually clear but gaga's is black it
has a very very very similar smell to it
a black fluid I actually like like food
better than I like this but this is
going to be gone in about 2.5 seconds
okay you see how much upgrade and I was
looking at this the outage of the Z's
both are 1.7 ounces and I know there's a
3.4 out that I seen on so for calm so
there is a bigger version of this that I
have got to get now these were sent to
me for PR and I only see our stuff that
I really like it's not as no simulation
if I have to talk about it or don't it
just send to me and if I like it I like
it if I don't I don't but I wanted to do
this because I am a perfume aficionado
just like I'm a music connoisseur
I love perfume and there's a lot of
stuff that I don't like like I said I
don't like things with strong stuff to
it that's why I don't like Cologne the
only cologne that I personally like in
jay-z's gold I don't know what he did
because his wife thinks that damn
Beyonce I booked all the rated-r that
Beyonce
Hot Tamale ad kandi that stinks and
I wasn't loved you won by a beyonce
perfume when she can't even wear she's
allergic to perfume and deodorant so I
don't know why you would trust her
judgement so nothing much but this cat
you did this girl this if you like
something light and fluffy to have a bit
of a sweet smell
now Britney Spears manatees are sweeter
than this this is like right on the tip
this smells like what I thought JLo glow
would smell like and it is not so this
is it's a great it's a great of toss up
you know you can make these if you want
to again this isn't my favorite however
I probably will wear this every so often
this is everyday get down for me okay
personally you see all the damn colors
in the back so you get what this would
be you know more so for me than this one
they're both they both smell good though
I think my sister would like this one
more my little sister she likes curious
by Britney
six she also liked white diamonds so
yeah but again like I said this is not
as strong and in here and why got me
this 100 this is about ten okay that's
the difference
oh yeah I didn't catch the first run of
these apparently this is the second time
test doing it but I believe that the
original sinner was a red it wasn't
black but I do like the the tosses of
the blacks I do like have on be beauty I
was buying herself before I started to
receive stuff like this and I'm very
happy that she's not just we makeup
she's actually branching out into this
now I did see on so 4.com that they
actually have like the spray roller
balls that are on the site so you'll be
able to buy these if you're not sure and
this is what I do when I'm trying to
figure out something like friends is one
of my favorites also is G Vaughn she's
irresistible think it I think it's
called irresistible me it's the pink
bottle the long thing bottom and what I
did was I went to Sephora and I just use
one of the samples that they have up
there if you go for and they don't have
samples you can always go or they don't
have that look in the roller bar section
which is like the long little stick
which I actually put on the screen right
now so you guys can see those are like
the travel one I'll buy those to put
them on car if I'm wearing a bag as you
can see any of those bags in the back um
also it in there instead of thinking
this because sometimes these can break
now I believe these are made out of
glass
these are not made out of plastic
however the window on this box is
plastic it is not glass then the actual
bottles themselves feel like they are
made out of a very durable plastic so I
but they like kind of like the 3d print
plastic where they don't break for
anything which is really good because
I've had some stuff kind of break and
it's no good until it's like the whole
bottles in your purse and then it's just
most terrible so cat definitely with me
out of a 1 through 10 we're going to
grace it I'm going to definitely give
this a just strong 9 because I'm not a
big fan of this one that's the only
thing but again you gave me two options
and I love this one so I'll give you a
night it would have been a full ten if
this one would have been a little bit
more to my liking but overall she did
bad so you guys are interested in the
Kat Von D singing Center I will put a
