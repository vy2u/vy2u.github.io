about her not at this moment where I've
been and why I have them in doing videos
or whatever were that that's totally you
really been to what I'm going to talk
about okay we'll get to that later on
there are other videos coming up it is
just by the way but yeah this video is
about Kim is Kim Kardashian she found
for divorce I don't know if it was was
Monday today um and the reason why I'm
doing this video because one I've been
going for a minute now I'm back with the
jump off um and I have to do videos in a
while um and put um I just said that and
because I don't really do videos about
current events such as like celebrities
and stuff like that so yeah this would
be fun you know and I got a nice opinion
about this situation um so yeah I found
out today my grandmother wasn't getting
ready to go to an appointment and she
said you know that Kim Kardashian is
something else she says and even married
a four year she's already getting a
divorce and I'm like what are you
talking about and she said she said on
the news that she's eating the rice at
you online because I was just on TMZ
there was nothing on it there's no more
highly cleans costume so I get on there
and biggest day Kim Kardashian thousand
for divorce from Kris duper's Humphries
I I will get to him in a second so I
chuckled and laughed and and I put it on
Twitter and then I put it on Facebook
and to me the whole situation it when I
first found out she was even getting
married was laughable to me just a
simple fact that there are certain women
in the industry that I could never seek
it and marry and I think you get married
and don't stay married for a long time
one Kim Kardashian to Christina Milian
three Halle Berry and these women are
beautiful women but it's something about
them obviously that they're doing to
either themselves or they're doing to
their spouses that don't they don't want
to be with them it's something about
them you know so I was just kind of like
okay so when I found out about the
situation yeah everybody has an opinion
about her getting married in her was to
lemon Reggie and all of this other shit
so I thought it was quite interesting
she was getting married so quickly cuz
I'm like I don't even know what this
dude is like my opinion really matters
but just like you usually didn't see her
with nobody like him is broke quickly
she treats her a man like a pair of
Louboutins like she put you on she put
you off and she she walked to another
parish ain't got top of it so I was
quite shocked and then yet a little bit
stunned when I found out they were
getting married so quickly so I said
okay you know whatever the situation is
then I found out that they had got
married and they did a special on email
when especially I heard about a two-hour
special about her motherfucking marriage
and I'm thinking to myself like bitch
who really gives a fuck I mean I will be
watching but I'm just saying though who
you know they could think the Royal
Wedding this is a Kardashian event but
whatever she's royalty over there and
because they given there gives a slicing
up some nice Sheva chicks so I'm like
cool okay whatever I'm watching the
entire remind you this is the first time
that any of us have really got as
viewers have got any inside - who Kris
Humphries is what he's about what he
even does who the fuck he is any of that
cuz beforehand I didn't know I'm not a
big sports fan so excuse me for being a
little bit ignorant so what the hell he
is but I just didn't know so then I'm
just seeing them constantly vicar and go
back and forth no mind you it is obvious
that when you first get with somebody or
you guys are dating it's gonna be
tension or whatever especially when the
TV show people forget that they take a
footage of a 24 hour a day or a 12 hour
day and then they put all the fights
that happen within 12 hours into 30
minutes so it looks like it's way worse
than what it is I was giving them the
benefit of the motherfucker it's out so
then I figure out okay so then after
they got married or whatever after the
special like literally two hours after I
watched that fairy
Kimi's fairy tale where the mind you
Kim's not kaykai's pretty so with it not
Kim and Kris is fairytale wedding
knocked on Humphries there's no wedding
Kim's fairytale wedding I said you know
there's something look everybody let's
go back went after like when the actual
way
went down before it was televised the
first picture that you've seen of her
were her and her bouquet body self bitch
will did you just marry your bouquet did
you marry your motherfucking self bitch
why are you alone what was that about
what you're supposed to be together
at least our Jones saggy ass had the
audacity she's kind of her husband
around but cam fuck all a bitch it's the
Kardashian show bitch okay unless it's
Chloe
Courtney a Mason or my mom or Bruce
maybe nobody else he end up in here so
since she didn't marry another him up on
this he was not invited to the photo op
after the wedding I don't know what the
fuck he was doing so I just I feel I
said it on Twitter I said I'd give them
to the end of the year into the end of
the year something's gonna happen and
they're gonna get a divorce I said if
they don't I give in to Valentine's Day
and I was motherfucking right I was
right Miss Cleo ain't got nothing on me
I was so right I knew that something was
gonna happen I knew some day are we you
know I honestly let me just be honest
and very frank here I watch the
Kardashians I am a fan of the Kardashian
clan I think their mother is great
because she makes sure that they get
that money she turned those 15 minutes
into 50 minutes and we are only a minute
20 so I still feel like we got a ways to
go with them girls you know so don't get
me wrong I'm not a hater I think they're
just a beautiful thing but in Hollywood
when you're when you put cameras in your
situation like that is it's only bound
to turn up one way fuck up that's just
bottom line there is no way that you can
function and your girlfriend slash
fiance slash your wife is the biggest
media whore since Paris Hilton and I
love me some Paris but we already know
where the situation stands two shots the
murder affair she falling on Twitter but
I mean I mean this is what they do you
know this is their job her job is to be
Kim Kardashian she doesn't have a job
title Kim Kardashian yes she's a reality
star she's an actress she's the
entrepreneur but all this came from you
know what I'm much
because I respect him a little more than
that but it is what it is
so my hoping about everything with the
marriage was how is this dude didn't
nobody even knew I don't even think he
understood what the fuck he was given to
him to be so very honest no I know
let me just we don't do it a reenactment
okay because I honestly feel this is how
everything went down ken was at a game
one of Chris's games where he was you
know warming the bench and she was just
like she asked her friend oh my god was
that and she was like oh that's Chris
and she was like oh my god Chris who
what does he do and she was like he's
like a benchwarmer and she was like oh
okay so dizzy he doesn't make money is
not like Reggie and she was like no he's
not like why you should okay what may I
try something different so then she was
like okay let me introduce you to Chris
so you know they met or whatever at the
game or whatever and she was just like I
am - and he was like her over there was
you know cause he's so stupid so she
figured out you know a little bit about
him - like no football a little
different stuff you know and then he
came up and said you know that's black
and she was just like oh really and I
have black they have a big penis and he
was like so they decided to you know
smush so when they smooshed her mom car
now mind you you guys this is pure
speculation but I think this is how the
whole situation went down so she get a
call from her mom the next morning after
they sort out what everyone was like
hell heck him and she was like hey mom
and then she like what are you doing and
she was like nothing just kicking it
just with my friend Chris and she's like
who's Chris and she was like oh you know
Chris Humphries and she was like who she
was like you know Chris I'm pretty seems
like a benchwarmer you know he plays
like in practice so she was like okay
he's an athlete she's like yeah she said
okay well I need to talk to you so call
me as soon as you leaving you you know
start today so Kim goes over to her
mom's house you know the Jenner compound
and she was like hey mom and she was
like hey Kim so she's like okay Kim I
have this great idea that you could just
like marry Chris and she was like like
phrase like I just met him and she was
like but you could like marry him as a
publicity ploy to get more money and I
can get my 10% and she had a little her
board out and she had a 10% up in the
corn or whatever so she's like oh I know
you're saying so I could be like the
biggest thing since like hub Britney
Spears and she was like yeah but we're
gonna just do it like a little bit
better it's gonna be real extravagant so
then Courtney walks in and she's like hi
drama and she's like hey cart so she's
like what's up and she was like court
mom it's like saying that I should marry
Chris and she's like who the fuck is
Chris she's like Chris Humphries and
she's like who the fuck is Chris I'm
afraid and she was just like I he's like
an athlete but I'll tell you later okay
it's not important because it won't even
last so she was like so basically what
you're saying is you're gonna marry this
guy you don't even know in order to just
like I'll do it everyone in Hollywood
and she's just like yeah it's just like
good playing Chris good good good plan
Kim I love you guys bye bitch so she
leaves or whatever after everything is
over
so then nobody's gonna tell Chloe
because of course Chloe got married in
like it's less than a month
so okay nobody can tell her because
think Chloe's gonna know that Kim is
trying to outdo her so Josh thing wrong
with this right okay so they have a
conversation and she's like you know mom
I bet you if you make it like a collar I
see Chris hello like pay for everything
happy to pay for everything so that we
don't pay for anything we could be like
a road Sharjah you know it's diamonds
very extravagant and she's like oh my
god Kim it is such a good idea that is
such a good idea so they they get into
clothes they don't tell Bruce or
anything because they don't never saw
Bruce shit so all of a sudden they you
know put out this ploy and then they
call Chris's people so they concrete
people and tell Chris Pratt you guys
just as allegedly this is what happened
allegedly from my own little mind in my
mind um so they call Chris's people they
you know get mr. Jordan you know he's
he's a benchwarmer
okay so mind you he no no money like
that you know so chemists shit all over
him with
money so in order for him to get what
she want which is some more press we she
gonna marry Chris so that he can get
some money out of the situation so that
he won't be as broke cuz he can remember
he can't even play he couldn't even
first up he didn't play in a game second
of all he couldn't pay for his a pastor
to even get yeah I was a galley I think
so um but yeah whatever does he could he
have enough frequent flyer miles to get
his all fucking pastor like really Donna
Trevor so anyway all that happens and
then after the wedding Kim is just
basically like you know and Chris it was
cold and everything you're a cool job
too but I'm already back and this is all
about Reggie anyway so I hope you get
your check in health and I'll see you
you know around I'm gonna make sure I'll
divorce tomorrow so I think that's how
everything went down honestly I do feel
like that's how everything went down if
you don't believe me whatever you call
Kim and ask her yourself
but I think that's how it went down but
all that situation as far as how it
happened I just feel like in Hollywood
people are so quick to jump the broom
because they got the money and they so
money hungry and they stole like just
I'm gonna be famous I want to just be
the I'm sorry I'm still more Kardashian
invoice I just want to be famous and I
want to be in you know the tabloids or
whatever the situation is but it's just
like it's a really sad though because
even gay people some people in certain
countries can't get married
and these people are brainy including
John dog let me some breeding but that
bitch was trippin to her first marriage
this is Kim second marriage they call
her Zsa Zsa
aka um what is that Elizabeth Taylor so
Elizabeth had five husbands so Kim you
got three motive girl onion so I'm sure
those to be televised overeat Kim's
third fairytale wedding you know just
whatever so I just feel like in
Hollywood people just really don't take
the sanctuary of marriage seriously and
then you got motherfucking Paul and John
who've been together since motherfucking
dinosaurs wrong the world and they can't
even get married that's that's just rude
and II know
and you want to get a divorce like 72
days bitch I know people's motherfucking
so means that have lasted longer than
her marriage seriously though like this
is a joke like really no like it did you
plan on staying here when you got
married it was this all part of the game
I'm just saying I don't know but all
bullshit aside though I seriously though
like look first on a photo as a sidebar
don't you hate them motherfuckers that
be on Twitter wish it like this
happening they feel the need to go in
and say whoa y'all talking about her is
the reason why she training and y'all
talking about her sorry was sheer
elevated bitch weak motherfucking know
that she's a lotta fun you know stupid
doofus add up there stating the obvious
stupid we know that shit like you you
know what kills me that had this bi
motherfucker that you care about your
ass will be the first bitch in line with
itinerary and motherfucking notebook
sounding off my how the fuck you feel if
you don't give a fuck shut the fuck up
that's how I feel we should come up with
the fuck out and give a fuck I don't
come in I really like whatever
I don't like X Factor I don't talk about
lunch it's wack to me on for what I
expected you like that and I leave it at
that but then you have them up those who
feel the need to chime in to the
conversation but they want to chime in
in a way where they feel like they doing
something shut the fuck that's why I be
blocking and mutant motherfuckers on
Twitter because they be on some other
shit makes you want to talk about it
when you ready when you moon - so anyway
off that I'm sorry um yeah I just feel
like Hollywood marriages are just
bullshit they shams they you know I feel
like Will and Jada they they think who
people but I just you know y'all know
what I'm done man so it is what it is
you get us all a happy say about mr. Kim
Kardashian and um crew conference um
that's about it so yeah I'm not to do my
review for Alexa fictional ma my face
and um I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
