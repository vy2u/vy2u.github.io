just start by saying is hate the
hairstyle love the hair
okay girls I've gotten so many requests
for this hairstyle I don't know what it
is I will say this a lot of people that
have requested this hairstyle have been
older and I actually show my auntie's I
sent her a picture like about an hour
ago she wears her hair like this I ask
you can I get that yes you can this is
about ten years okay so my inspiration
for this look was of course Olivia Pope
because Olivia's hair is like this all
the damn time I don't even know if
scandal still O&amp;amp;I I watched it I don't
know how long but this hair that I'm
rocking is a body weight texture from a
from a Aliexpress company car I think is
wick here Laki hair and they sent me I
don't remember guys so I'm just gonna
because I do remember cutting it I think
they send me a 13 by 4 somewhere it has
to be somewhere between 20 and 24 inches
that they see me because I see me four
bundles I only actually used three in
this hair because I didn't want it to be
super duper full just because I felt
like it was just very unnecessary it's
just because I knew I was gonna do this
because like you guys do not know how
freaking long and how many people have
come across Instagram Twitter snapchat
asking can you do this hairstyle can you
do this hair so is there any way you can
do a review on this hairstyle like
something with a dark lip better than
just like y'all this is definitely like
to me this is like you know I love my
executive realness which I get the Bob
right okay this would be the boss
that would be the intern this would be
the balls okay a lot of older women like
to wear their hair like it's all I've
seen it on younger girls too but for the
most part I've seen this Wendy Williams
his word is here so I don't know how
many times so what I did was when I got
it it was a typical body wave shape
which was the S shape and I took it and
I went ahead and I put it Wow shampoo
did and I conditioned it of course I
didn't like the way that the body wave
shape was after I wash it it was still
there but it wasn't as prominent as I
would like when I first received it so
that was kind of like mmm typical body
wave you know it's nothing it's nothing
crazy or different and I told you guys
like body wave is the main thing they
want to send you when you do reviews
because it's the easiest you know and
I'm just like I don't want it to stay in
its natural shape if that's gonna be I'm
getting used to looking at myself like
this the longer I sit here but because I
just looked at myself from our previous
review I feel like I don't know myself I
feel like I have 10 kids
I got a multi-million dollar company
address situation I got to work for
Marchesa or something but um yeah I like
to wear trench coats
dark lips hard bangs and a little razzle
dazzle so I was like okay I'm gonna go
ahead and just do so I went ahead and
straighten all the hair first because
usually if you're looking for something
that's gonna have some body in it as you
can see has a lot of body up here what
out happens around brush it or what
everybody ladies actually the perfect
texture to do that because it still
wants to not be super straight which
means once you go ahead and strain it
it's still gonna have a bit of a fluff
to it which always works when you want
to have something with a little bit more
of a body into it when you don't want it
to be super flat so I went ahead and
after I did that I cut it and I'm pretty
much cut everyone did it in of course
three layers because it's shorter but
here so it's shorter here in the bag and
then it comes a little bit longer in the
front just because I didn't want it to
run
my coat back here cuz I know I'm wearing
this coat so like I don't want it to be
where everything back here starts to
wanna do this so I just cut it add a
little bit of an angle like such so it
goes like this in the back and it comes
down you can't really tell unless you're
really thin dead behind me like this to
tell that I actually cut it that way and
it because it has this Wan curl in it as
well so that's the next thing I took my
remington wand and simply went through
just the sides of it and then i went
ahead and cut the bangs cut them across
and then put a little bit of a feather
on the side you really can't tell
because of the fact that my lashes are
killing me right now like they're doing
the absolute most but cuz i'm not like
China like I don't like when my lashes
go up against yeah get him still once I
did that then I put it on I was like
whoa I feel like somebody's mom now you
know but as far as the hair is concerned
the only thing that I'm not crazy about
is the style the hair itself is
completely fine it's typical body wave
and you guys like I was trying to make
my point earlier which is when I do give
body wave now I just have I can't wear
it in this natural state because it's
boring it's boring how many times are
you gonna seemingly wait here it's
boring but as you can see this has a lot
of shine into it and I didn't use
anything specific in the hair after I
did it I didn't put no like I just use
this but that was it I didn't I didn't
go crazy with this so I just took my
wand start it in the back wanted it you
hold it for a little bit like you wanna
promote two seconds you say you let it
go and then you pull it on it a little
bit and then it's gonna bounce back and
create this very even defined look now
this side look like this side where you
can tell that everything is uniform like
such this side has been giving me a
little bit of problems and just I don't
know why but as you can see it's like
this so it is what it is but a lot of
people like this hairstyle and I think
it's because it's very easy and it does
make me want to command a room I mean
yeah I don't know I got on sweatpants
with this but yeah I have some glasses
I can't think if I have any like with me
glasses let me go see let's see and I'm
gonna come back and see if I have some
glasses it's gonna set
Oh with this I feel like this is
definitely command in a room this is
definitely like try me if you want to
little girl just knowing that one you
know it gives you like atomic blonde but
in black so atomic black how do you the
other ones I'm sure not gonna work with
a just a little to guard afraid but why
not I'm not too mad at it these are
decent Versace galoshes that everybody
have I got these as a gift and I never
worn because people were wearing these
like crazy and I D listen y'all know I'm
a gaudy Queen but lord have mercy these
glasses or a lot this gives you command
a room type of feel or whatever for sure
I personally will probably wear this
hair with the bangs were straight and
all of my straight because I feel like
straight will completely change the look
so yeah check my Instagram post tomorrow
I'm gonna straighten this out and see
how I like it because I feel like it
will look better with straight hair
just sayin or this look which is very
Rihanna shut up and drive Jenny Jackson
pleasure principle
fefe Dobson's whole career you know just
all of these similar things or whatever
that's what I'm getting from this so
like I said it's cut in the back it's
cut higher in the back and then in the
front it comes to usually what I do is
when I cut it high in the back are
usually bring it here so as usually at a
point but I decided to go ahead and just
chop it really nice and straight here
and I like this I don't know what
they're what for me I always figure out
like to me body wave is a way of having
straight hair with some you know body in
it but it straightened really nicely
which I really like and then I also
enjoyed the fact that it's really flowy
I was into Ashlee Simpsons it didn't say
boyfriend before it is that's what I was
feeling like you know like you Lindsey
play do you guys like this it was a
performance that Jenny Jackson I
remember doing she had like a way like
this but the wig was like a brown
it was like a asymmetrical bob and it
was real to the front but you got that
shine popping off coming through Sean
another thing I did was I went back and
just use my flat iron and just went over
and took the curls out that was it with
the wand curls out and laid it and now
this is how I cut it originally and I
was like this is really cute but I
wanted to show the body wave ish feel to
it without taking away from you know the
style but I just I can't do the on teeth
the unti wig I can't get y'all know I
like those but I can't do that girl oh
yeah what are you guys feeling about
this I'm like this I'm surprised that
I've never done a wig like this before
I'm shocked because I really enjoyed
this girl I ain't gotta worry about my
hairline so my frontal was very I didn't
pluck it and I didn't bleach it just
because I knew I was gonna wear like
this okay
so I had every intention of cutting
bangs into it and that's the great thing
about cutting bangs into wigs is that
when you don't want to have to do all
the extra work which is like I'll pluck
it or bleach it then and you good but I
did do a strand test and I do like to do
strands has in the back of the unit when
I make it just to make sure ain't
nothing good because there's a frontal
and then there's bundles - I usually do
them separately which is my longest
bundle I'll do that at the end and then
I'll do my front two in the very back
when I did cuz I do test out the knots
to see how the lace reacts to bleach
because sometimes like I told y'all
sometimes frontals don't want to bleach
sometimes you have to do them more than
once just depending on what it is but I
didn't have any issues with this it
didn't know where colors it wasn't
nothing crazy like that
as far as shedding goes I did get quite
a bit of shedding when I initially put
this in but since then is Society and
that seems to happen a lot with
aliexpress hair I don't know why but
usually when I get it up were like okay
you know and I do cut my lip so let's
keep that in mind - I am a weft cutter I
don't follow my lips because it can't be
is I wanted to be with at least not for
me I've seen people like aqua minor
minor E flat I'd be like okay well if
yours is considered flat girl I don't
want you to see I want to see your super
duper flag
girl that may just be right up
underneath my girl so yeah for me
certain times certain looks don't work
with folded West so this was bodyweight
here but I knew I had every intention
and kindness or whatever I didn't know
in the capacity I was gonna wear so I
didn't want to go ahead and fold over
and then be like my hair is a little bit
bigger than I would have liked because I
thought I might to keep it in its
natural state so yeah as far as
bleaching goals you guys know let's let
y'all know by the color no don't do it
take so it's not worth it as far as
bleaching goes it's very pretty like
this and I would just simply keep it
like this so if you're looking for some
basic black hair that's gonna come to
the point this isn't like a 1b so it has
you can't tell under these lights but it
has like a brown a brown undertone is a
dark brown though it's not a light brown
cuz sometimes I'll get him and I'm like
okay girl this is damn near like a
distance of two so overall I will give
licky hair an eight and a half the only
thing that I didn't too much care for
was the fact that it was body wave I
mean that's just a given but if you're
gonna get by the way this would be a
nice by the way to get just remember
that the texture does fall out after you
wash it and that's the only thing that I
don't like and I'm gonna say fall out is
not so uniformed as when you first get
it so as you guys have that are new here
how you doing
but usually when I have those issues
where I feel like my hair is falling out
I'll just go get some flexi rods like
the big gray ones and it wrapped them
and it brings back that S shape but if
you don't want to do that then I would
just honestly wear this hair straight I
think it's better straight than the days
and body later in my opinion so yeah
hope that answered all your questions
and I am out so where is this out and
act of if my eyes are super it is cuz
these banks have been sticking me and I
got some glue in my eyes I'm just being
honest so again if you guys enjoyed this
body wave hair from Lake Huron Alex for
us and I hope you guys enjoyed this and
I'll catch you in my next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
