in like quite some time you know I'm not
gonna even give you a little queer why I
haven't been doing videos it's just that
I had um but I do want to talk about
life today because um some people feel
as if I don't have one and I do but you
know not to say it like that like Oh cuz
I gotta like go out on the videos it's
not that it's just that um you know you
I think when you busy with something
like when you have a hobby or something
and you get busy and you start to do a
lot of things at once it's just like
before you know it it's like the hobby
kind of suffers a little bit and that's
kind of what happens with this I started
and then other things take over and I
start going in different direction but I
do have something that I'm passionate
about that I want you guys to be part of
it's just that I have to get everything
together like you guys don't know my
birthday was Wednesday so thank you guys
pro I got a whole bunch of happy
birthday so thank you guys so much for
that um and yeah I've been good like
I've been really good I've been having
fun I've seen all my friends me broken
in so we'll have done videos I just have
to say um so yes it's been good but as
far as the life is concerned like a lot
of people have been having it hard
either whether it's financially or just
your life isn't going in a direction
that you want and sometimes your dream
like all of us I believe we struggle
okay cause it's hot my hair is father
this is my Sheena's hair emporium here
as you can see it's so high and I got
his damn jacket but it was cold when I
left today yeah life can get a hold of
your ass and strangle you if you don't
allow it to be fun and I think I did
that at some point I think since I've
just had a birthday I've learned in life
a lot of things aren't worth stressing
about and being unhappy about and being
mad about a we get
people Inhumans we get upset and mad at
the dumbest and some of the is
just never worth it like a lot of it is
just not worth it at all so for me I
think that I've learned in all my years
of being born that and being here and
just living and learning that you know
you got to be stress-free and be happy
about the things that you're doing
because if you're not passionate and
happy about them and people are gonna
see that you know so I think that's kind
of where it's at for me as far as much
my time is like a at one point join
YouTube for me was hard because I had a
lot of other stuff that I wanted to do
but I didn't do because I feel obligated
to do these videos and people don't
understand like it's not just it's one
thing because your phone is always with
you or you may have a camera always with
you but sometimes you don't always want
to do a video or always talk about
something you're not always in the mood
to have an opinion about something so I
think for me I feel obligated because of
all of you guys who have supported me so
long I felt as if if I don't do this
then I'm gonna be a sellout like so many
other people and I had to get out of it
it's like no you're you're growing like
I started doing videos when I was like
19
you know sin and I've come a long way
since then so in the path of me growing
things have changed and the way I see
life the way I prioritize my time
everything has changed so I think when
you get into something and you start to
grow up as a person the out looking at
things that were important to you aren't
as important or aren't necessarily not
as important but not as much as a
priority made something else be you know
if that makes any sense
so I'm learning to stop trying to please
everybody
like I often don't take my own advice
when I give it to you guys and I just
shows that I'm still a person and I'm
still flawed just like everybody else I
can admit that a lot of times that I
will say something and I can be so
conducive and help out someone else's
situation but when it needs to be
applied to my situation I don't I don't
do it you know and I think that's
something that I'm learning
to handle and deal with um same thing
with friends you know you outgrow a lot
of friends you gain some friends you
outgrow them a lot of things happen in
life and it's all in how you handle it
and some people as adults don't how to
handle it they handle they still like
children so I think throughout life is
best for us to always hang on our morals
because a lot of people I know that I
started like our friends with that I'm
not friends with anymore then their
morals changed that's like the
underlining thing I've noticed that
their morals change so their actions
change and their actions being changed
changed the way that I looked at them
and wanted to necessarily deal with them
so I think you know as you get older it
is true if the friends that you grew up
with are not always a friends that you
keep as adults because everybody doesn't
have the same Drive and passion for life
that you do you know a lot of times
people will it's cute and and dandy when
you have friends that don't do with
you in high school
Riley even in college but when you
become an adult and you become
responsible and starts to do things for
yourself and grow up and have dreams and
aspirations and your friends don't share
in that you feel some type of way
because I don't know I have like okay so
you don't want to do anything with
yourself you want to be Carly's homeless
and just getting high all day that's
what you choose to do nothing there's
anything nothing anything wrongly
getting high if that's your drug of
choice or your vice or whatever I
personally don't do it but if that's
what you do that's what you do I'm not
hating on you but I'm just saying if you
decide to get high or they are smoked
all day or drink all day or whatever you
decide to do make sure it's followed
with something that is productive
throughout that day and it doesn't have
to be every single day like some people
on Twitter and Instagram be killing me
oh make sure your day is a productive
day every day you ain't got to do
you know Sandra there you go to work or
you go to school sometimes you need that
me time and that's where people don't
know that balance in life you have to
balance having fun and getting your
money and living out your dreams where
it's having some sanity and having some
you time because if those start to clash
and start to blur lines
well you can't remember or understand
what day is from the neck
but yeah just make sure you make that
time out for yourself because you don't
ever want to be in a situation where you
just so unhappy about everything you're
working so hard and you don't have it
basically a moment to smell the flowers
in life make sure you don't pass up
those moments cuz I've done that a lot
where I'm just doing too much at one
point and I'm not getting this done I'm
not getting that done it is a lie you
know so I think the point of this video
of me saying is appreciate the things
that you have and be happy with the
things that you have but also enjoy life
and learn from your experiences that I
cannot stress that enough make sure if
you are putting in a situation and it's
not working out for you or the situation
isn't work you learn from that
experience because that's the only way
you're gonna grow if you air at a
standstill straight manikin then
therefore there's a there's a point and
were you as a person have to say what am
i doing you know like if you ever
somebody break your heart and he was
abusive then you know next time that's
not when you start to see signs you're
not with him it's time to go if
you are in a situation where you were in
school and you slacked off in your
semester and you got all D's and
F's then you know next semester I need
to stop kicking with my friends a little
tow truck and get my ass back in my
books like I'm supposed to and make sure
that I even it out and make sure that my
schooling is more of a priority than my
partying with my friends you know so
it's just like that just don't don't let
life pass you by and you don't learn
anything from it because you're gonna be
a very unhappy ass on irresponsible ass
adult and I know a lot of them so you
don't want that so yeah pretty much
that's all I had to say I do have a
celebrity fuckery video coming with Ray
J um y'all Avanza hmm
though your banks and somebody else I
don't know I would like to say though
about those I know you guys have been
asking I would like to say cuz there's a
lot of going on and I need to
just definitely address but you let's
come to you guys and say that keep your
head up if you guys have anything you
guys like that's bringing y'all down
don't let that faze you cuz it's
only gonna last for a second alright
see y'all later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
