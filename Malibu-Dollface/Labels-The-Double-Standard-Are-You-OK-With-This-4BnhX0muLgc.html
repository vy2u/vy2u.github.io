too high you mama doing T mom I said was
that the furrow all y'all that's
watching tomorrow I said so tell the
debates a was that yeah
shot at City Mama's Father's Day was um
I don't know when Father's Day was but I
did call mom and say Happy Father's Day
to her because she was the bottom father
you know you know how that go um but
today I want to talk about a topic that
I've touched on in previous videos but I
don't think I ever elaborated on really
and that was labels and um I mean labels
and I want to say contradictions but I
know that's not the correct thing
labeled and no I'm really trippin y'all
labels in what do that say up there oh
whatever
levels in other stuff oh and it double
standard there we go
okay wait anyway oh yeah so um you guys
know that in this world there is a big
label problem when I say label I will
elaborate on that a little bit later but
the double standard a lot of times
things are but um you know a certain
group of people labeled can get away
with something where others cannot get
away with it you know and um I just
think it's I think it needs to stop and
I think that we need to take notice of
it because I don't think we really get
it
okay simply if our female is she dresses
her back and clothes she likes to wear
Jordans to her hair in a ponytail um you
know she played basketball you know she
looked up to football basketball players
she's either one or two things labeled a
tomboy I leveled a lesbian there is no
in-between like
ferrozzo misleading she's one of the
other you know whether she said she's
not and she could barely be telling the
truth she not like furniture to say face
but she really telling the truth
you're still gonna label her that
because you know that's what you think
now if there's a guy let's say he's the
same age it's a to grow 16 he's 16
he likes tight jeans tight t-shirts his
hairs a bit long
his favorite thing your maybe Beyonce
you're like a little Moriah up in the
air - you know what a - Janet and he's
free-spirit about who he is but he says
that he's not gay you know you're
automatically going to label him gay
because these are characteristics that
you see being okay and that's yet
another label now this is the problem
that I have here he can be gay in his
trade she can be gay she was straight
whatever the situation may be whatever
they're telling is beside the point but
the difference is the girl is gonna be
treated okay where the guy is gonna get
ridiculed and disrespected because of
what he likes
now this is fake both of them are gay
she still gets more respect because
she's a girl
who dresses like a boy and the dudes can
respect her and the girls aren't a
problem her him being gay is the problem
him being flamboyant is a problem him
like and Mariah and and Janet and Brandi
and Beyonce problem him dressing the way
he is is a problem so why is this a
problem and this is another problem it's
the same difference
why is there a problem why is there here
and no here I want to know the
difference another circumstance
why is he oh she's off he gets praise
she does not give race you know no mind
you I don't appraise no whole activity
period so don't
think that I'm saying yeah you should
praise her - because she a hoe I'm not
saying that I'm just saying it's not
fair because you're giving it to one but
you're not giving it to the other one
and that's the double standard that I
have a problem with like I just feel
like it's so unnecessary and I think a
lot of kids are confused due to this due
to the simple fact that they feel like
well if I was a dude I could do this and
I could be okay with it but since I'm a
girl I can't do it you know and you are
a man and you're raising your son you
should not be encouraging him to go out
and sleep with a whole bunch of man or
women and if you're a woman raising a
young lady in this world you know you
should teach your class greats and all
that is good stuff but at the same time
when you get older you are accountable
for the things that you do if you want
to grow up and be a ho if you want to
grow up and be promiscuous that's your
business just be protected if you ain't
gonna be protected I'm sorry for you but
I just don't understand how you can take
one side and not take the other that
doesn't make any sense to me and I think
we as people the reason why I was like
this is because we elect we let it be
that's why it's like that we can't
change the world I understand and this
video is not to change the world it's
just basically to open and enlighten
people and what things that they're
doing if you have children and you let
your daughter go and sleep over at
someone's house but you don't let your
son go sleep over at someone's house and
it's not for a good reason
that's not figure that's a double
standard you letting her go because you
feel like she's gonna go and do anything
you're not letting him go cuz you don't
trust the way he doing and it comes back
to you as a parent if you're not
parenting your kids to do the right
thing when they're not and your
supervision that's your fault you can't
blame them and disqualify them for life
and having fun because you're not door
correctly so let me tell you though my
momma let me know you watch somebody
else too lame in fear and let me find
out she was tripping let me find out she
without doing some y'all mo uh-huh real
good uh-huh
you ain't gonna you don't want to leave
them all in the world so it comes out to
your parents in with that but just the
whole double standard with their life I
don't understand I don't
and the fall loves to ring during these
videos I don't get it you know I'm
saying it just and it's always somebody
complaining about something I didn't
ever fail y'all just thump it don't be
selling this stuff you know just oh but
what's up with what's up but anyway um
basically I don't get also in with Damon
and straight man why is there a
difference you know a man is a man no
matter what how you put it are you wanna
twist the situation are you under
whatever a man is man but they look at
gay men as less of men because of the
fact that we are not the norm or I guess
you could say the what every other dude
is you know type situation and it really
doesn't bother me that part doesn't
bother me because like I said before I
think pride in the person that I am I'm
not normal I guess you could say oh what
the we wants to be normal I'm a
misfit
I'm Jeff Frank you can't categorize me
in a box you know but I'm often called
transsexual drag queen this is fattening
all terms that are not true you know you
know and it's you have to you have to
know what you're talking about in order
to speak it if that's if that makes any
sense to you you know you can't call me
and try to clean cos I don't dress up as
a woman and go parade down a runway and
you know I'm not saying my face is not
beat to the heavens and my hair is not
as high as the sky so you know type
situation you know how don't compete
with my looks for it I mean that's the
dry clean you know I'm saying so you
have to categorize that in the correct
terms otherwise you just sound stupid
and a lot of times when people label
people certain things it's because of
the simple fact that they have lack
thereof knowledge know what you're
talking about before you say it because
basically calling someone something that
they're not just makes you look stupid
and you think that you're doing
something honey it makes you look much
more dumber when you say something that
just really holds notes
type of anything you just look at done
you know I don't take offense to it
because I know who I am and it is what
it is you know but the fact I I do get a
bad rap and people just like me and who
are androgynous and we can't really
necessarily help the way that we look we
just are who we are
she's like being black you can't help
the fact that you're black you're not
you're spending sure you're Caucasian
you don't choose these things these
things are given to you and you're
taught to live with them and deal with
them not try to be scared of them and
run away from them because when you try
to run away from them
yeah things don't really turn out too
great I'm very proud with Who I am and
every person who's watching this video I
want you to understand that in order for
you to go on and life and be a very
healthy happy person you have to be
happy with inside first before you even
try try to run on the outside ain't
gonna do that that would make you look
very bitter and usually it just really
doesn't work don't fun just be happy
with who you are and you got a
disfigurement if you got issues with you
got whatever if you're broke you know
whatever the situation is be happy but
don't try to hide the individual that
you are you know because it's somebody
out there that's just like you you know
and if somebody's labeling you something
that you're not don't stomp your feet
and cuss and get mad at it because
what's going to do you know what they
gonna do
they feel like they won't even though
they dumbass them called you something
wrong they still feel like they want you
know but I rather enlightened then
disrespect that's how I feel like that
I'll put somebody aside and say you know
what you calling me is it technically
wrong you know but just what you think
you know because you're doing a lot of
this another and not enough it is so it
is what it is to me um when girls are
labeled hoes and things of this because
they've happens to be promiscuous or
they like to sleep around or whatever
situation is I'm hey it is what it is
you may be oh I don't know who you may
be oh you know but who am I to say what
you're doing is wrong if you're sleeping
around that's your business
I can't judge you like I said I'm no guy
you know and I have no hella to put you
in so I can't necessarily say what
you're doing is wrong now I can say I
don't agree with it there is a
difference you know but I'm not gonna
label you something because I feel like
what you're doing is just totally wrong
whatever now you was hurting somebody I
can understand that because they know
that's just wrong you can't be
people and stuff but other than that
there's not really much else to say
about that particular subject just just
and then and we tend to label ourselves
you know on Twitter I see it all day I'm
team I'm on Team time on team big cities
I'm team little booty I'm team you know
itty bitty titty committee you know it's
just come on now come on then you get
bad when you ain't in the mood and you
don't want to be calling none of that
don't call me that
but you got it in your bio this is what
you call yourself all day this is what
you randomly tweet isn't what you
randomly put on your wall on Facebook
you can't get mad and what someone calls
you if you give them the mo to call you
that
that is just eight so instead of
labeling yourself this and team this and
that defect and it's too thick just be
team yourself how about that be label
yourself yourself my name is team Brandi
my name is team Jennifer my name is team
Brandon my name is team Osiris
my name is whoever Otis you know be who
you are don't generalize yourself and
put yourself in a box because we even
know you may be this and be so proud of
it you know even people in the gay
community we're very proud folks of who
we are but don't be so proud to the
point where you you just your pride is
putting you right in a box with the rest
of the bitches were so proud to be there
you know it's just like I'm I'm with
y'all but I am me okay that's the
difference I feel you but I don't feel
you you know I you know do that because
it'll set you apart when you start
becoming the norm ain't nobody gonna
know you when you start to blend in
don't nobody see you and that is the
difference you can always be seeing
without whooping and hollering and after
yell about I missed
I'm matter we did and we did and we did
you know Oh No
okay because the quiet confidence is a
lack of confidence that is the
difference this will just think about it
just think about what I just say to you
okay
just think about it aloud uh-huh it's
true so yeah
come on just come down come down with
the fourth second think about it and
just start to be here with yourself
level-headed in here okay all of this
I'm this I'm that
no okay and when and if you join
something if you doing some more immoral
 you know just realize that when
other people do it come and don't get
mad about it you know just you as I uh I
need you see ur owns whatever you know
