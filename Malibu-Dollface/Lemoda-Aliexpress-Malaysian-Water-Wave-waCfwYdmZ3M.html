friend little little situation yeah
going on or whatever so excuse me I've
been out kicking it and it is because
it's my case no more y'all might leave
the time that's ended back but it is 234
in the a.m. my eyes are bloodshot red
I'm in doing nothing I'm just really
tired because I didn't plan to do this
but this hair I'm rocking right now and
this frontal Oh girls neck honey no-neck
monster don't do that time this hair is
from a company call I believe is Lee
motor hair I've had this here for five
months at this particular point and I of
course I'm here to let you know how I
feel about it
this is their malaysian water wave hair
now there is a story behind this and I
will get to that in just a second but
let me give y'all all of my info my
frontal is 8 13 by 4 it bleached really
good I'm a wild look extra light and
brassy on camera but in person it's
giving you scalp realness yeah
any person or the lesser mighty gram I'm
a girl that but yeah it gives me like
stop realness in real life but on camera
I'm getting new camera anywhere so bad
past that but yeah it's a 13 by 4 ladies
front so it was pre plucked but I
plugged it away more girl and no hair is
out so all of this is actually the front
so this little piece right here is
really bothering me because of the way
that it kind of darts out in the front
we'll get to that and then my bundles I
am wearing four bundles of I think it's
24 inches or 22 inches of the Malaysian
waterway
okay so the company hit me up and they
hit me up like I want to say usually
when I'm doing a review it takes them a
couple of days in order for the mission
sometimes but just recently today a
company took like a month for them to
actually get the hair and stop because I
hear the 616 come in and it took them a
little bit longer because I wanted it to
be available by the time they shipped it
out so that once I reviewed it within a
three-month period I would have it so I
was wondering why I kept testing out
this hair and I noticed that every time
I would wear the wig it would seem like
a different way and I'm like why does it
seem like every time I wear this hair is
different and it's because the company
had did two reviews with me for which I
believe is the thing hair
I'm just being on it but one is a
Malaysian water wave and one is a
Brazilian water wave so I was wearing
the wigs simultaneously because again
you guys know I stopped till out my
review that way and I'm like why does it
seem like every time I want to wear this
my bushiness it seems different is
because it was two separate wait and
because I work like a maniac that's why
it's almost 3:00 in the morning and I'm
doing the video I couldn't figure it out
so when they finally I had did a
different review which was for the other
wig and I was like why does this seem so
what it was like whoa one person was
emailing me and one person was texting
me so I was texting me texting me and I
was getting so confused so it took me a
while to get to this plus it took me a
little bit longer because I have things
about this that I really don't like okay
so to the actual hair itself because
that's what you're here for is this hair
is actually diffused with a actual
blow-dryer diffuser this is not the
natural state of it after you wash it it
will be more like this if you let it air
dry it will have more of a drop to it it
won't be this big and bushy so again
this is a diffuse situation that I got
going on the next thing is the actual
frontal the frontal itself I am NOT a
fan of as far as the pattern is
concerned the actual frontal itself in
the lace I love okay so just know
there's a difference and you guys know
y'all by the human Sadie's for the
hundred and
thousand times I do not like what
companies leave this much of straight
hair and then arrests gets I you can't
do anything but Styles like this with
that because of the fact that if I tried
to wear it is natural state I will have
all of these straight roots and then it
would fall I have hair from companies
who actually had it where it comes from
the rules so alley motive LaMotta
however you say your name can you please
do something about your frontals because
what's about to start to happen now is
every time I get a frontal that I don't
like that does not match it I'm going to
send them back it's that simple
because these cells everybody's not
gonna do this is a style because I was
going out and we better have who was
turning up or whether I had a jacket on
mind you so you know my mom Janet
Jackson was covered up but I just felt
like this is a lot for the average
person I don't always want to have to
wear my curly hair in a kind of
protective style so that it makes sense
so I just straighten the roots even more
and it really do too much straightening
right here so it's a little bit bulkier
here because I wanted is it cuz I don't
want it like keep having the strain and
then I just end up with a straight
frontal cuz then the point of the
frontal was what no the actual hair
itself this hair has to be detangled
before actually wearing Uggs like this
so I can actually do this and have no
issues with it okay so shedding this is
what you're gonna get okay
oh that's what you're gonna get now it's
not a lot but it is again like I always
tell you guys any hair that has any type
of any curls in it usually not really
wavy hair it depends if the hair swells
in any type of way when you do run your
hands through it you're going to get
shedding it's inevitable it's not it
doesn't have to be a lot and again this
was diffused so therefore if I keep
doing that it's just gonna make this
look like a big bush and that's not the
look that I want I want it to look a
little bit more a mother take baby off
but I want it to look a little bit more
attained and not so humongous okay so
then we come to actually
he's constructing the actual wig I will
say like I said about the front so I'm
not crazy about it but I don't hate it
okay
it's the difference I just wish that and
match the texture of the hair much more
than it actually did at the own if the
ends are the only thing that match that
doesn't I think here's my great okay
because it's not terrible here's my
great if this if I was you guys know I
do to Rick James look sometimes if I was
to do the Rick James with this I would
still have to touch up my roots wait
manufacturers of any but especially
China manufacturers because most you
guys watch these reviews because the
hair is more affordable which you will
want to do is have something that makes
I'm telling you right now if you make a
frontal yeah thirteen by six preferably
girl because I got this touching my
sister right thing to my mouth okay when
you have something that matches it's
easier to maintain I would have wore
this hair in its natural state with crow
cream and stuff like that but the reason
I can't do that is because the top of my
hair just simply does not match so it
sucks when you have some very decent
comparable hair with a nice pattern to
it that you just simply can't wear
because the actual root part does not
match you know and I'm just I think the
the disconnect here is the fact that the
people who manufacture this hair don't
wear it so they don't see what the
problem is you know when we do reviews
were contracted by people that are in
China whose their hair is usually just
bone strength thick and black they don't
wear weaves like that they don't wear
wigs like that it's not a staple to them
like it is in the african-american
community so when we do have people who
are manufacturing something that they
don't necessarily use it sometimes gets
just gets very confusing so I'm saying
this loud and clear
we need curly and wavy hair frontals
that match curly and wavy hair bundles
just like we do with this string you see
I can lay out a straight situation
because everything flows together this
can't be my only option for this you
know it can't because if that's the case
I'm just gonna start using some you guys
companies frontals and then y'all gonna
be mad because I'm using other people's
products in your video so it's not to
say that the hair is bad I just need
them to do a little bit more and be a
little bit better about trying to make
sure that everything looks cohesive
everybody doesn't want the wig look I
know I don't you know I'm saying like I
want my still I guess growing from my
head but I cannot do it if it does not
match so if I have to give this hair a
grade between after five months one to
ten I'll give it a strong seven and a
half because of the fact the frontal
takes a lot of that great off because of
the fact that the frontal but aside from
the fact that it was very well
ventilated I didn't have to do too much
plucking and manipulating and then
bleach with no problems depending on
what this light right here is talking
about I would give it that had the
frontal bin cuz y'all knock I mean look
I just I just thought this way I had
like two years ago I just wish it wasn't
a closure I was funny enough about it
I've just seen that picture being sold
on another side while you're playing
your boy is out here in these streets
when I tell you go I am everywhere girl
I'm like a or glass calls roads girl so
yeah I'm happy to be back shot at the
alley motor they were very understanding
to what was going on it was also some
other stuff that I'll get to in a later
world but um I just want to thank you
guys for being understanding and again
take this to I would like to come back
let's just say in the next four to five
months and I would like to do this exact
same texture but I would like to see the
improvements that you guys have made to
your frontals also starting against them
13 by 6 because it's 13 by 4 minutes and
20 20 19 even though this is a 2017
situation it just doesn't work for me
okay I do not want my part to be that
short it looks longer cuz you know I
know how to manipulate but again I do
this as a living I do this on a regular
basis a lot of you guys just simply want
to get some hair that's affordable that
you can wear that you can get up and go
so we're gonna try to put our foot on
their neck and see how far we can get
with this
I'm just saying cuz a lot of this
repetitiveness is a reason why I hate
sometimes to do videos because I'm
telling them the same thing and
like yeah okay so anyway we're not gonna
do that listen to what I'm saying I'm
saying this for people these are your
customers listen to what I'm saying this
is an option it should not be my own
thing so like I said it'll be a seven I
will catch you guys in my next one
love you guys thank you guys for being
patient with me it's a lot going on that
I will get to in a vlog and yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
