before I start I wanna some of y'all
kept asking me like what does the
hashtag I keep hash tagging on my videos
this month me and it means a video a day
in May so since you guys say I don't
blog a lot and I don't do a lot of these
type of videos this was my way of doing
so I'm using my selfie stick
I got the Chanel one and I was cleaning
up see um so yeah this is part of what I
do on a regular basis focused oh we
could talk about y'all this is the car I
don't want to get these people license
plate but yeah I want that one that's
the one I'm gonna get Nick cuz I can
procrastinate like nobody's business
I will wait to the very last minute
that's why I be rushing and irritating
with my Love &amp;amp; Hip Hop reviews because
I'll be like all right
they go up Friday so that means I take
my notes Monday on Tuesday I could take
my screenshots on Wednesday I record
Thursday I edit Friday I upload that was
my plan I'm sometimes doing all of this
at one time which is so ignorant and
stupid on my part because and I make it
harder on myself I don't know about that
your eyes look very green
so I'm gonna review them to see if I
like like them and if I do like them
then I'll get some more colors but it's
not then it's doubled my last pair but
these are the desi oh these are in a
forest green so they're cool
I think they look natural they look very
natural in the Sun the Sun they look
very natural but if I like get under a
light or a lamp I don't really like how
they look but here comes Sun mommy right
here you should be able to see see they
look like mine yeah
they focus was my focused but I look
fell off for that but yeah this is what
I do on a regular basis when I'm just
out like walking because sometimes what
happens is um I spend so many hours on
the computer and I'm gonna do a question
and answer because I was one of my
questions how many hours do you spend
editing it depends on what I'm editing
love and hip-hop
usually it's between like 12 hours if
I'm doing everything in one day then I'm
usually editing for about a good nine to
12 hours to try to get everything damn
they need to repave this I'm on a
computer a lot so sometimes I need to
just clear my mind and get away and this
is one of the good ways for me to get
away is to go working normally I
wouldn't take a camera with me I mean I
think my phone does that's what I'm
using to record on but normally I
wouldn't record you know me walking
don't this house look like a jersey
shore house sometimes I just get really
flustered and I get very aggravated with
Instagram and YouTube and Twitter and
not even just what people say with just
the fact that I feel like I keep doing
the same thing over and over and over
again which is hitting these
apps and I close the one that goes to
another one that close one who's another
one goes another one
and then I would like oh my god you need
to get I need some fresh air okay I need
to see real people I need to see grass
and houses in things trust me I don't
walk in a hood but um I do go walking
cuz it's it's therapeutic and I remember
when I didn't have a car and when all me
and my friends used to buy hang out and
stuff there was a car involved the car
wasn't always working right so a lot of
the places that we went so I got
accustomed to just walking and doing
everything so now I just do it it
doesn't bother I'll be walking mouths
you know like I took my friend with me
she was not having it well I like open a
hair company of my own because I refused
so much hair or makeup line like a lot
of other youtubers and quite frankly
that's not really my focus I love hair
and the transformation of hair and the
versatility of hair as well as makeup
but it's not something that I will one
is like actually parlay into a business
you know like I would be in a dog
business before I will be in a hair
business it would make sense because of
what I do and I know I can hear people
that you can make a lot of money I'm
sure but it's not something that I
really aspire to do and everybody's
different you know somebody asked me why
I never they never see like my family
and my friends and my video
and that's because I think a lot of
people forget that as youtubers we chose
this life you know my mom didn't choose
this my sister didn't choose this my
granny didn't choose this my friends and
chooses I chose that and sometimes
everybody doesn't want to have every
move that they make recorded and put on
the internet you don't I'm saying so and
then sometimes people some people some
of you guys know my sister some of you I
don't know um but when those situations
come about I don't really think it is it
will be the most comfortable for my
grandmother's to be buying chicken and
somebody be like oh can you tell don't
face that I love him you know I don't
think is that type of suit because
people done that I'm not saying that
there's anything wrong with that
I just I'm not one for you and I'm
saying I don't want to put nobody in a
position back I like so that's that's
the reason why I keep it strictly me I
know it would help you guys kind of
understand me a little bit better if I
did put other people in my videos but
that's not really my channel is about
you know I think they're I think I don't
get mad at people from saying that
because there are a lot of youtubers who
you know they say that y'all this Hill
bone I went on a long Street was
Hill yeah that's the reason why I don't
put any of my immediate family
another question was how do I deal with
criticism from the internet and you know
just people in general because of how I
look at who I am and things of that
nature
um I'm real frank with you okay it's a
daily struggle to have to deal with the
opinions of other people but I will say
that me being gay growing up when you're
a child and you hear people call you out
of your name for something that you have
no control over you learn that and if
it's usually family members that are
saying things like this to you it's
really easy to let a stranger say
something and let it roll off your back
when you've heard it from your immediate
family you be like girl you ain't
sending them but I've heard that before
so basically I've heard worse from
better you are right you have to kind of
take it with a grain of salt it doesn't
always feel well it ain't always nice
you're not gonna always handle it with
the best grace but it's life it comes
with the territory of who you are but
it's just not gays or African Americans
are Spanish or hard it's everybody we
all go through it we all have our daily
struggle mine's maybe a little bit
tougher or a little bit easier than
someone else's but we all go through
things I will say that I get a lot of
love from you guys on my worst days so
that's the great thing about it because
what people don't understand is that I
am an individual till I go through
issues and problems and
ever play um sometimes I don't always
want to be the most adult in certain
situations you know like I don't want to
always have to be the bigger person you
know I have a video about being a bigger
person I did not say in that video you
gonna always be the bigger person okay
sometimes you do want to throw check a
bitch because they don't not a
watch their mouth that's just the way
the world works but I'm not I'm not a
angry person you guys know I go to
Disneyland more than I can for them too
so your happiness is based on you as a
person you can't be really upset about
certain things and certain people that
you're allowing to make you sad or make
you upset
you know like to know it's gonna be what
it is incident happened recently where I
lost my cool
this was not on internet comments
ordinarily on the internet but I lost my
cool and I went off and I don't
apologize for the things that I say
because that's how I felt and I think a
lot of times when you feel a certain way
people try to find a way to make you
feel like your feelings are to be
disputed if you feel like a person as a
bitch they are a bitch they don't matter
what you say he said they say you know
I'm saying is that's how you feel so
your feelings are not not valid and I
think people tend to forget that or they
want to be apologetic for how they feel
I'm not apologizing for if you if
you come to me with some I'm
gonna come back at you with some
 if that's where I met with it
yeah I'm saying like you have to
understand everybody ain't gonna be
happy well you can't let people get you
to that point sometimes it's not the
people that get you to the point it
could be something totally different
that can make you feel away about a
situation and they could just be the
catalyst that just pretty much pressed
on that last nerve and you're just ready
to just
boom boom pow and then they like oh
you just lost your cool and then they
don't understand how long you may have
been dealing with the so don't
apologize for how you feel sometimes you
can learn from said situation not to
feel like that I'll react like that but
your feelings are not in my opinion your
feelings are not to be debated if you
come to me right now and say I don't
like you I'm gonna tell you I don't know
what to tell you that sure that's how
you feel and we can move on from that so
it's not gonna change me or how I feel
I'm just gonna say okay that you don't
like me so when I see you next time I'm
gonna let you know you like I'm obsessed
with the moon landing cuz I feel like we
didn't really go somewhere I'm into your
regret anything in life I regret a lot
of pictures I took just in fashion
don'ts
I regret that a lot you know wait it was
cute for the time it's just some
pictures I would never let leak out god
no I'll be reviewing my nail polish this
one is yellow and this hand is like a
white color these are from my Christian
Louboutin nail polish said they came
with a blue color too but I tried it on
it's just it looks better with foster
nails didn't it work with like natural
nails like blue look like you know and
little girls don't really got that much
nail and you put it all on the cuticles
that's what I like so I didn't like that
color but these two colors I like
they're very spring and Easter e'en that
good stuff so do you guys want me to do
like a soundtrack like doll faces music
soundtrack with that cuz some of y'all
be like what song is this and then I
sent you the link and they be like this
ain't the same song or I have a
different version of the song or maybe
the song is no longer available so I
know songs like I'm so very beautiful
like by Michelle I can not say her last
name but y'all know what I think I used
that song in my curl video y'all but
wrapped somebody song
then somebody else didn't know and you
wrapped it like it was yours and so yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
