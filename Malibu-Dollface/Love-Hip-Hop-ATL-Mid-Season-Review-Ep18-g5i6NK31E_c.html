was on my little hiatus that you guys
kept on asking me about was love in hip
hop everybody wants to know my opinion
about love and hip hop at all baby you
know I got one every Monday night you
guys know I do on Twitter I do my
commentary my live commentary on live in
hip hop so yeah you guys like my Bambi
shirt a lot of people sorry I'm not a
lot of people didn't know that memory
was a bully
it was pretty like me just I'm just
kidding
um so yeah a lot of people one of my
opinion on live in hip hop so here it
goes we're all like episode 8 so it's
like a midseason review if you would um
we're gonna start with Jocelyn okay this
is Joe Carroll tackleberry shot to miss
P she does the best weekly updates on
living hip hop but yeah um
Jocelyn Oh Jocelyn Jose Rihanna man
joseline joseline is um is a trip to say
the least I don't understand her stance
she doesn't have one it's just like I
don't like tbh about Olustee because you
know Stevie he he from my brain you know
have you ever really loved me Stevie
she's that type of person and shit like
she's mad at him she's not fucking with
him when she's with him she's with him
so I guess you can call her a writer guy
if writer guys are stupid I don't know
I'm not that type so call me what you
want
um but yeah she to me um I like her I
don't like her music though I like that
my lines then you'll get up chuckle um
when she was TV bust up in the studio
like bitch what you doing up in my
studio where my peoples are cutting
records and you ain't tell me about it
no I told you we ain't doing that song
bitch now Stevie J we don't go to him
next we don't get back to joseline
hold on back Stevie J will go to Stevie
J he is crazy like that nigga got some
some some personal mental anguish when
it
Blin or looking at just I don't
understand why he's on the show I
understand why but I don't understand
why he's on the show if you get my drift
um he's very contradictory for real
he's very crazy he's very creepy
he's just soaked he taught that bitch
don't you ever do that again
you look good nice by the way look who
says that now let's go back like 293
remember what's love got to do with in I
tote in and these words and I quote you
know anime if you die I'm gonna kill you
right I'm gonna kill you know how do you
kill someone where they're already dead
I would love to know I would love to
know cuz you can put me in a casket
right now I would love to know but only
do two got some real mental problems
would say some stupid crazy ignorant
bullshit like that and Stevie J has
proven to be just that um he's him and
Jocelyn's relationship is just it's
stupid it's a we're together we're not
together we're doing each other but
we're not doing each other she says she
don't wanna sleep with him no more but
then she said we can't be fucking around
one more oh you don't you want to give
up all of this you all of this you're
gonna start having sex with me he'd make
a half starts I having sex with me he's
never gonna start having sex with me so
obviously they both like the bullshit
meanie and let me just say this before I
even get some into Mimi I don't respect
weak women I do not respect you because
if you don't see it
why should i why should I try to help
your ass and you don't even get it
she has she she gets the award the 2012
work for the weakest bitch on reality TV
for sure I gotta give joseline more
respect to her because at least Justin
know I can fuck with him for lunch
rocking fun with somebody else Mimi you
he has disrespected not only you but he
has disrespected sure daughter he has
reached disrespect at your household he
has
disrespected the family dynamic in
general and the reason why he does that
is because you let him bitch and you
won't continue to keep letting him do
what the fuck you want to do so stop
crying that's talked about had Obama I
had no daddy girl I know some bitches
from the hood you ain't never had our
parent and still don't go for that
bullshit so don't give excuses because
you're an eight you're an enabler
you let him do that so he's gonna keep
doing it and you're gonna keep crying
bitch and y'all like this shit
so obviously good motherfucking riddance
poor little Eva cuz she is gonna off me
like my mama was just she had no
backbone if a man ever comes to you and
tells you hey you gotta ask him did you
cheat on me that mean it's time to go
that means it's time to get pack your
shit mama pack your motherfucking
pocketbook and get the fuck out because
he's not the one for you a real man is
not gonna cheat on you
somebody who really give a fuck about
you ain't gonna try and hurt you in any
way so Mimi you a weak bitch know that
understand that and do it that shit and
I hope you see this because you need to
understand you are setting an example
for your daughter to be just like you
and she get some odor she's gonna see
this shit you honest something about TV
it never goes away they're gonna be
playing these motherfucking reruns it's
a Eva it's 45 so therefore she's gonna
see my daddy was like that woman my my
mama stay with him so I should stay with
man like that too
it's a pattern you were like that
because that's will happen to your
mother
you see what I'm saying at one point you
have to stop doing it and joseline you
another you when that bitch told her a
man it's gonna be a man you shoulda let
him do what he wanted to do I wanna sock
that bitch squid or motherfucking my
bitch why are you talking to me you
don't even have the right to speak to me
at this point bitch
why are you talking to me I'm trying to
be nice and stay lady that I'm a I will
fuck your ass and he needs his ass flip
too he need about a good foot up in his
ass and a wrench to the face for him to
understand the dynamic of the bullshit
that he's pulling and none of these
bitches have any right or any backbone
to tell him and they keep going back to
him
ethnic he got to have a baby arm up in
pants or something and order for him to
keep getting these women to do this it's
just any but it's them that's the thing
it's them off them three stupid asses
little scrappy I don't really have much
to say about little scrappy because I
just think he's the definition of
ignorant I don't like him he made some
comments recently I'm in regards to
Frank Ocean and gay people that I don't
like so I'm not gonna really spend too
much time on him because he's just
whatever to me he can't wrap to me
personally
he's ATO fool if you want to call it
that because he I'm a living it I was
born in a i'ma die in a we get your ass
off my motherfucking screen a so anyway
um Erica I think Erica is a very good
mom and I think she's a very good woman
I think where she lacks a little bit of
humility is the fact that she's not
willing to open up about what's going on
in her past and obviously something has
happened to her you know in her past as
far as her mom is concerned you know she
said her mom was on drugs and you know
which is I know a lot of people whose
moms was on drugs so that's
understandable
I get that um but I think if she wants
to like have a successful relationship
with someone her communication skills
are gonna have to get a bit better
because I will give scrappy this much
she is saying something that is very
much true she's not a great communicator
as far as what I'm seeing on the show I
don't know about her a regular day so
don't ask me shit cuz I don't know but I
know as far as what I see on the show
her communication skills are not because
she's not saying what she wants she's
just expecting for him to know what she
wants you know so it's like Google can't
nobody read no minds you gotta have to
say what you got to think but I do like
Erica I do like her and she's bounced at
her shit if a bitch stepped to you she
gonna step back at you she won't step on
your foot to let you know how to fuck
she feel so therefore I like her
Rashidah Rashidah shit
her hair is pretty um
k.michelle k.michelle is by far my
favorite cast member because the
righteousness righteousness the
wretchedness that is k.michelle is very
relatable for girls that I do know I
know
girls who act just like that who've been
through that and it's understandable
you know III feel free because I know
women who have been abused and been
through that and and people have lied
and they've been blackballed and you
know people were telling them oh that
didn't happen to you and then another
day and it did you know and people were
there and still don't when I take the
inside because of the fair you know
fucking up their public image so I
understand I get it so I understand it
she just she's just extra I love it
because it adds a great comedic flair to
the show because the rest of the people
that already name they're not funny so
um yeah momma Dean is the same with
scrappy I really don't have much to say
about her because she's extra her bangs
are terrible like why you got them
premature ass bangs and had the mother
fucking gone and the gumption to try and
pump the motherfuckers they was like
right here like this have three seats
bitch in color for real I got time for
you so yeah momma Dee's she's whatever I
could give her take her she's not like
momma Jones she's not like Frankie she
you know she's about her business
obviously but she's not really that
entertaining to me she just she's just
somebody crazy-ass mama you know like
you go over somebody house and you'd be
like you drop them off and anybody won't
come in keep like your mom at home yeah
well I thought to you later so I said
her she's one of those um so yeah not
really feeling her um karlie redd I
remember Carly from scream queens you
guys know I love war movie so I used to
like scream queens all the time she can
act out of a paper bag she was terrible
and she'll got on the show just because
she needed some exposure for what I
don't know I don't care so um yeah she
she's just whatever she's she's she's
looks old
she just looks really old in the face I
don't I don't know how oh she really is
she just looks really old um and she
just seems like a user to me like she's
trying to like claw anybody in order to
get her name out there but yet instead
she's not doing nothing with that mother
fucka Louie Prada Gucci Gucci I got the
cards girl you ain't never seen a
motherfucking black card in person today
in your life and you if you have he was
from a distance but she was Joey lies
coping and shit so yeah I don't really
see karlie redd in the future
as far as music is concerned or in the
big screen as far as the movies are
concerned she just seems like she's just
a cast pillar like Rashida that's why
she didn't get talked about um Shay Shay
is not officially on the show but um
yeah why that unit that she got bitch mm
she look like she's think she looked
like she smelled like pickle juice and
cotton balls like wet dog and baloney
like she don't look like she smelled
like good at all she smoked I think
she's my pretty right um but yeah No
thank you for building um so who else is
left
Arian she is a cosigner she's really
pretty and she makes a lot of sense they
don't get her much screen time but to me
she's just kind of like a cosigner you
know as far as those situation is
concerned um so yeah I believe that
everybody if I forgot somebody that mean
they wasn't that important on the show
so far I think that this this season of
Love &amp;amp; Hip Hop is definitely better than
last season's of New York's for sure
because this one has a form of
wretchedness that I love that is funny
to be so I think that is very very very
much interesting um so yeah I'm curious
to see what's gonna happen I heard that
uh scrappy proposed to Erica at the
reunion show and uh Bucky does that be
shined you can call shaped by me so
Bucky aka Francine don't she look like
Francine y'all she look just like that
bitch um so yeah I don't sound only racy
that that relationship lasting anyway so
they look like they was just having some
good old hot sweaty monkey sex
just because I don't really think that
they were trying to be together like
that but who knows I don't know so yeah
it looks like it's gonna be a really
good season you guys know I'll be
watching all the way into the reunion to
see the bullshit that they present us
thank you vh1 thank you um oh you
um as far as the fighting is concerned
is minimal this season it's not really
much I think it's only been two fights
well two fights in the incident because
the situation that happened with Kali
and a k.michelle don't you ever lie on
me I'm from Memphis bitch so yeah I
think this is a really good cast and the
h1 definitely did a good job with
casting these people I just would hope
next season that Rasheeda is replaced um
and that's the only person I can see
necessarily being replaced because her
storyline sucks and the fact that I
heard that her and on pay Michelle have
been fighting because k.michelle whoa
Rasheeda saying that that's not what
happens her emissions didn't do that and
I'm so disappointed in Toya for even
mentioning Kay Michelle's name and
actually feeding into the drama although
I don't feel cat Michele is lying but if
she is so irrelevant to you and she
doesn't matter to you why are you
speaking to her even if you're asked
about it just because somebody asks you
something does not mean you have to
answer the question or even talk about
it so you just gave her the benefit of
the doubt
Memphis looked her ass obviously it's
pretty damn obvious she wouldn't be
lying on him if she was gonna lie on
anybody it would have been somebody
worth lying you know why in about know
Memphis is not nobody to be lying on
about we didn't know we wasn't she
married you Toya and we only know you
for being somebody's baby mama so I'm
just saying I like Toya but I just don't
like the way that she's handling herself
in this situation came to show has every
right to say what she wants to say she
got her ass beat you didn't so if
somebody with my eyes and somebody said
well you can't speak about it because of
this person's position in the industry I
was spit in your face fuck you cuz she
wasn't there when that should happen to
me I'm just saying though so yeah I'm
just I'm very very very very interested
to see what's gonna happen for the rest
of the season so I think we're all
season eight I mean season eight episode
eight so tomorrow is Sunday so tomorrow
we will get the new episode which looks
very interesting cuz looks like Rasheeda
okay Michelle have it out at the table
it's a lot of Tears so yeah I will do
another review like when the after the
reunion show
to let you guys know how I feel about
that but uh yeah sounds yeah later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
