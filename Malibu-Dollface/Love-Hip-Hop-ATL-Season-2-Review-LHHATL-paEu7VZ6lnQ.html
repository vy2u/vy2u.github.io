normally in due to the simple fact that
I was having some personal technical
issues or whatever you wanna call it a
my hair is like uneven with this hair
that I have in is actually some body
wave hair from Sheena's hair Emporium
and I am loving this hair I will be
doing a review on this hair soon I just
put it in a couple of days ago and I
absolutely love it if you follow me on
Instagram then you know that I have been
talking about this hair and I am
obsessed but and this look that I have
going on right now it's very Lana Del
Rey but my hair is how Katy Perry's was
at the Grammys that's what I was going
for set mine is a little bit longer and
I have more curls at the bottom than she
did but we'll get to the hair in the
later video but I promise you guys that
I was gonna do a Love &amp;amp; Hip Hop review
for a lot supposed to do like a
midseason then I supposed to do when I
was little I go episode then I was a
little Miss season and now it's like
over uhm but yeah I'm just basically
gonna do it because of the simple fact
that a lot of people want to kind of
know although I live tweet every Monday
well I tried to but it kind of it didn't
go too well but yeah I will say that
this season was a little bit boring and
I don't know if because we had more
people on the cast or whatever the
situation was I'm not really sure what
it was about the season but I really
wasn't captivated like I was last season
it wasn't as bad as New York was this
year or last year whenever the hell that
came out with Erica and and Olivia's
manager and all of that shit like it
wasn't that bad but it definitely wasn't
that entertaining um so I'm gonna start
off with scrappy only because I want to
kind of get his ass out the way scrappy
and you know he's the king of the south
or whatever there'll he choose to call
himself these days whatever he's
interesting I'm not I'm not a fan
the only thing that I think scrappy has
done that I actually like is knuck if
you buck and he was I think he produced
that he wasn't on the track besides the
talking part um but other than that I
was kind of sad to see that rumors has
said that soldier boy and diamond were
supposed to be part of the castus season
and obviously they didn't make it so
that's unfortunate also it just seems
like this season scrappy just didn't
have anything to do he wasn't in the
studio making no songs called put them
paws on them or you know any bullshit or
whatever it just seemed like he just did
have nothing to do so scrappy the season
he kind of gets like a f+ to me I mean
even get a good grade last season either
but he got to get like f+ for me because
I'm not really I'm not I don't you know
like it's just you guys know from my
last days I don't like scrappy period so
off him mama D mama D this entire season
with her queen is this and and the
royalty and the palace and all
additional Ashiya roaches like just dead
as she's the way she got roaches like a
lot of roaches to top it off um but I
don't I don't like my mama Deborah hey
hey mama dog I'm not a big fan of hers I
don't really care too much for her
this season she just seemed like she was
just stirring up a lot of trouble
another person who looks like they don't
have anything else to do and if she wore
like her weaves have been the absolute
worst she she needs her ass whooped
because they had let this woman come
outside and her weave has been half of
this is real with the other half is
weave and there if there's a line of
demarcation there there's no blending at
all mama Deborah
delete whatever the fuck your cover the
color is Deb really the BTT awards but
um no you just need something to do you
need a man like I haven't seen her with
a man since the last guy she tried to
get out which was I think the dog sitter
dude I'm gonna hurl that win but yeah
I'm not a big fan of nominees at all um
the next person is it's karlie Redd this
season karlie Redd seems like again
she had her buck teeth like okay let's
just get to this point karlie Redd it is
second season you have got to check so I
don't care I don't know how much your
check was boom but I will say this there
is no reason for wheat for us to be in
second season and you still got them
busted ass teeth there is no reason if
Scrappy's buck to crooked tooth no tooth
ass could get some money to get him some
brand new perfect teeth there is no
reason for your lopsided booty ass to
have them same vampire ass teeth walking
around talking about Carly does this and
that's that and this is that your weed
was not popping this season it was
horrible the color was cute the way that
it was done and what was put in with
this remodel fucking spectacle I don't
give a fuck what you say umm and then
you carry weed and your way you still
look like you use beauty supply here
what the what kind of Brazilian air is
that let me know um I wanted to know why
Carly continues to kind of put her so
she put herself in situations where she
continues to look stupid and fucked up
and just messy that's why I don't I
can't do Carly read to me his wife
period she's not a singer she's not a
rapper she damn sure actress you seen
her own scream queens are horrible um
but uh Carly Rae you get with momma Dee
and scrappy you get a F Plus just
because you made an appearance on the
show and you got a checks on that's
worth something um Erica I like Erica
and I think most of us do like Erica the
thing that kind of bothers me about her
is that a lot of times what you probably
see on camera right now because it is
damn bright as hot as light that's got
going on right now um her face is very
hard she's a beautiful girl and she has
beautiful bone structure but a lot of
times her face just comes off super
duper hard like mine's right now um so
yeah I mean I understand you know she
has a very uh strong bone structure but
other than that though I give her props
she stands up for herself she takes care
of her daughter she doesn't mean she's
supposed to do I just wish she would
kind of kind of shake scrappy Foley
which I'm seeing from the blog she's
done so that's great um so she gets she
gets a B+ for me you know
Benzino you ain't got no neck
um you just get an F period you get our
motherfucking e cuz I just don't like
you you look like Stretch Armstrong
remember when we were kids we had the
Stretch Armstrong I had the Jillian
inside but he had no neck that's exactly
what the fuck
Benzino looks like like dead ass or he
he more so look like this where is just
no neck it's just anyway um the next
person that I'm gonna talk about is
Tracy and drew they're gonna get work
okay this season when I seem to prove
you for the season I wasn't like excited
but when I seen them on my article
they're gonna really bring some like
some drama drama but no they didn't they
didn't bring no drama drama it was kind
of whatever drama alright like y'all
don't understand these motherfucking
this light is fucking bright and it's
hot as fuck I'm melting over here like
that helps I'm still shiny as a bitch
like a penny but yeah drooling Tracy
they they I thought they were gonna
bring something new to the show but they
didn't because they remind me of rich
and Erica with far as their relation
were so rich and Olivia from New York
but I'm not really a fan of either one
of them I'm out
Tracy is a businesswoman I respect the
business women and men who do their
thing and they got their shit however
she does look like duckie the cartoon
I'm just saying she she looked just like
fucking dougie so hey dougie um and I
don't know why drew finds himself to be
so desirable because he's not cute
like he got that roller coaster head
where it's like it's round but when you
go to the side back here it's just
really it just goes straight down like
did anybody else notice that the only
thing that is cute about him is his eye
color and that comes a diamond doesn't
for all the half-breeds like myself
walking around these days so it's not
they could have been I really hope they
don't come back next season because
there really serves no purpose but her
nose to mouth ratio is quite interesting
to say the least so they can give like
they get a C they get a d-minus because
I just don't really I didn't really feel
it was it like I said the season was
boring to me so it's not really like
it wasn't that interesting in my opinion
um the next person that I wanna talk
about is joseline and Stevie only
because they were the show this season
as they were last season and I think
that it's pretty evident that they came
back for a second season because of
joseline and Stevie that's just uh hello
I only watch it because it's a meanie
obviously but I'll get to her ass in a
second um joseline is TV worth there so
this season Jocelyn's weaves were on
point there are a lot of times where
I've seen a lot of myself and her weaves
we're like okay Jocelyn okay you did
that
thank you cuz you needed that um so I'm
happy at the fact that she's upgraded
her look because remember last season we
first saw her she looked like a straight
I use the card mrs. dipped because in
the trailer she just did that dip in the
motherfucking um in a studio that's the
only thing that I knew her for so I call
her miss did but she she definitely
upgraded herself and I'm happy about
because she needed it um
Stevie just looks old washed no he's a
typical dude he's he's an ass and that's
unfortunate because one day Eva his
daughter is gonna have to watch these
episodes and see how his father
disrespected his mother in such a way
where she wasn't on shit but they get an
A+ only because they are the show they
are the show the next person is okay
Michelle k.michelle this season I liked
her a lot more than I did last season
her punchlines were weren't as good this
season but they were good um but I'm
happy I'm happy to see that her was she
to kind of patch things up in that last
episode it doesn't seem like they're
gonna be friends but it does seem like
they kind of got something resolved and
you know something solved so I think
that's good at least she's growing as a
person and she's not still ignorant
bitter and mad thank God because she was
a hard managing blood shit a little too
so like even Mary got over that shit at
some point um the next person is Kirk
and Rasheeda and I would give I'm just
flat-out they get an A+ only because
they actually kept the drama going and I
don't know how much of this drama was
actually orchestrated or what
actually real but they did a good job
I'll say that a lot someone who was
obvious shout-out to Bambi from that's
my Wives LA girl talk about those chicks
you all up in another franchise acting
like us but you know I don't I'm not a
big fan of curtain or Rashida cuz I
think Rashida and her like why does it
always seem like every time Rashida hair
straight it's always pretty cuz it I
mean obviously she has a lot of hair but
she always got one bundle in and it
always be like 34 inches like girl Yasha
is saying you i 4 bundle jaw for full
ass bundles and you think I planned a
review coming soon fuck with me but um
yeah I just heard he just was the
ultimate ass this season he was
disrespectful he was rude he was a nigga
he was which you don't want your
daughter to be with which you don't want
your son to be with what you don't want
your child to be with he was and he kept
saying he wanted to turn up and do him
and it's like you are a grandfather
what are you turning up at fucking I hop
like where you turning it up at the
fucking senior citizens home like you
have grandkids like really Kirk is this
what we gonna do
so Kirk and Rasheeda I mean I I give her
a sheet of credit because of the simple
fact that she did send her guns at the
same time I didn't think that she stood
her guns enough because it is simple
fact that he kind of it seems as if he
still got away with what he wanted to
get away with he came crawling back when
he seemed that the turn-up was over and
then a girl name was Mary Jane like she
probably kick it with Eunice and you
know Elmer Alda and a Joann in him like
really you thinking what a bitch named
Mary Jane okay so they get to me they
get a B+ but strong b-plus because of
the simple fact that they had some nice
drumming because last season they were
too lovey-dovey and they were boring
Mona scott-young so yeah um the next
person is meaning this season Mimi Seema
she came into her own as a woman but she
still seemed like she still has a lot of
growing to do as a person which we all
do so I'm not gonna kind of take that
and kind of say that she's wrong or
whatever the situation is but at the
same time I'm not really feeling I've
never felt Mimi like that because it
there's a certain there's a lot about
her that seems non-genuine which I don't
like she seemed like she has a very fake
side to her she seems very um like a
flip-flopper like she doesn't really
stand her gun and all that wolf and she
was doing an Arian after Ken Michele
about that bitch on my head with him
tulips that you know is you know you
can't how you gonna look at somebody
who's your friend you should look at
that bitch in there singing this shit
like she would have got the business
like the old people she would have got
her ass whooped just like fucking unison
him like you don't let no vision bother
you especially then you know it's gonna
be on national TV and then you gonna go
buck up at your friend an Aryan you are
a good friend because I could not deal
with Mimi she would have definitely be
the last person I call if anything ever
happened to me because she's just not
that bitch but um I like her it's just
something about her that doesn't rub me
the wrong the right way and then this
whole entire season it seemed like she
had nothing to do again she had nothing
to do and then a dude that she was
messing with Nikko let's talk about him
for a second why the fuck did Nikko look
as if somebody like he got into a bar
fight and somebody hit him in the face
with a fucking bottle and then hit him
in the mouth for the Bible his mug was
fucked and she was really like listen
everything always about looks but in
that case it would have to be because
that motherfucker right there was not
the business he wasn't the one to two to
three to seven to eight the ex wildin
woodsy like mmhmm but I'll give me me
like a B you know mmm but okay it is
what it is um the next person that I was
named everybody Oh Aryan Aryan you get
an H I like the season that you came out
your show you said you like girls you
served a purpose you know sometimes it
was a punching bag purpose but it was a
purpose and you seemed except for your
singing bitch let me tell you something
man since you
I always wanted to be a singer mission
but that's not gonna happen today okay
cuz you can go down there with Cassie
ass
y'all can have a little powwow about
what the fuck y'all can't do but no so
let it go bitch
let it ride cuz that's not gonna work
but she does seem like a really sweet
girl and I do hope that at some point
she gets the girl to hump on that she's
been one you know I think she want to
hump me me though
or they might or her and joseline or
whatever you know I guess you know but
joseline it's Stevie take the reins in
this situation for me dude citizen but
oh let's talk about che let's talk about
che and che Mack um che sir will would
like to relay a message to you okay
and he told me to tell you bitch get
your own man
because you have been competing for a
man since you hit the scene so you need
to get off your shit get the fuck over
it and get up your own man would show
32-inch know that was a 42-inch ponytail
that you had and your bangs was about
four bundles but yeah he wanted me to
just relay that message to her and about
her so I'm gonna let that slide che Mack
look like the friendly dragon at the
face I'm just gonna say dad you know and
she had the gates on her mouth like
shout out to everybody who got braces
run out of his face so anyway I'm gonna
wrap this on it yeah che Mack I'm not a
big fan of hers but she kind of serves
her purpose that's kind of a filler she
she was what she was this season with
che was last season unnecessary so yeah
I mean love in hip-hop second season ATL
was it was okay it wasn't
I'll give the whole entire season I
strong C+ you know but it definitely
could have been better because we got
other shows that are out right now that
are killing the game men are very
interesting and you want to know more
about it you want to watch all day but
that wasn't really one this season
catfish is more entertaining didn't
loving him up at this point but
hopefully next season um since
k.michelle is leaving somebody else
comes along and really kind of blows the
lid off this popsicle stand but uh yeah
my review I hope you guys enjoy and make
sure you guys I never say this but
comment subscribe and then follow me on
instagram which is at malleable doll
face and on twitter
that's a malleable doll face and then
I'm bout to delete my facebook so that's
no point to be talked about but you know
it is what it is I'm mad cuz I I curled
this piece and I didn't leave the flexi
rod like this I'm sort of kind of
drugged but that's okay I see y'all
