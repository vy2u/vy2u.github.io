reunion on season I mean episodes one so
this is going to be a review on the
reunion part one Anton joseline what the
fuck was up with that moon bounce dress
that 2-tone dress
no girl cuz ain't nobody got time for
your Technicolor that is also the jaw
cage that Mimi and joseline and Stevie
all had on the same shade of magenta and
they outfits it's like a threesome
rendezvous pop it off I guess it's safe
to say that karlie ass is pretty fucking
old because this bitch do not want to
reveal her age and any cost
bitch all neck is wrinkled why do Erica
have on lingerie
what cuz you're going fit did anybody
else notice that Carly's ass is like
pointy like is is it do this like is in
here okay I mean I'm gay I know a few
transsexuals and some dry Plains and he
adds is steel don't look like dead I'm
just saying
somewhere I woulda got when I was out
black no you don't get another one
because it's fucked up you you ain't
goin that around again I see is no I
have to give it to joseline she's really
real with Hearst cuz she was you know
she really think she wrote when she
wanna be yeah I'm saying like she you
take joseline with a grain of salt and
you kind of throw that bitch out the
window like whatever bitch and Johnson
like the baddest bitch you know like you
got joseline Jackson just mean we'll get
to that in a second
Chanel occur then a court whoever the
will chanela cabana court is I would
love to hear her
about joseline hottest bitch got her
name what stigma she don't put on his
name delica all right bitch I will say
this
joseline is very honest about her
parents she's done to the poor she like
bitch fuck it I'm on vh1 I'm you know
real check I don't have to shake my ass
that I brought ya no more we can tell
all of because I'm good now I've been to
jail enough I'm good we good everything
is cool fine baby whatever it is safe to
say that Carlene is Nettie her hair is
messy fuck girls are messy her jury is
messy her ass is wop sided MSE her age
is old she lived like a dinosaur she
looked like a tropical bird she's a
senior citizen she kicked me with
Harriet Tubman she knew mark dr. Martin
Luther King she used to date Jesse
Jackson that bitch is a whole lot of
shit like hey Michelle do it we're
schita you know we're really like kill
me is when I've been said I had to get
out of my record deal because he they
even let me go like I did you like that
was she said it as if she cared was he
can give a fuck
shoutout to famish Oh screw being creepy
messy like she was low-key messy Lydon
busy with forensics
somebody poor joseline and Stevie aside
and so we gotta let the beauty supply
shake-and-go wig go for joseline
especially for the reunion we need to
upgrade this bitch
so shout out to joseline forgetting our
real weave with some real hair
good job kudos kudos girl you need to
date you anybody notice that scrappy is
a court Anna blood is that just me did
you did you catch that psychotic did you
get it was kind of Ambler you
Eva easily topper yeah but then Jocelyn
really say but I love me me I love I
look fuck John that I do love me me I
care about
since when did loving someone include
sleeping with the baby daddy like I know
that Stevie's call wait really
really didn't I'm starting to think that
it's an alternate relationship going on
here where she loved her in a different
way because she said you know me mean it
was a baby you know it was and now Mimi
keeps saying don't judge her and she she
know every woman's been cheated on and
how dare you sit at home and judge her
all of us on Twitter and all of this
listen Mimi you put yourself in a
situation you put your story out here
and it doesn't mean that every bitch in
the land was cheated on bitch we ain't
talking about everybody else you talking
March Oh stupid ass and now you mad
because everybody calling and pulling
your car maybe that you should have been
talking that shit just TV and joseline
ass instead of talking about us on
Twitter if Mona calls joseline just lean
one more time it is Jay OS e Li in E
naught J OS e L even but his
pronunciation girl is Josh Lynn not just
lean she had her name right one time
over a two-hour show and you the
executive producer
I loved money I let you I'm just because
I need a sure thing so apparently momma
Dee ain't the only cast member who can't
spell cuz he talking about
I am God boo you spell dog backwards
that's all it was Stevie
get one and fit it I have to say shut up
to joseline for making sure that her
chick is gonna be in a meal no matter if
it's with Stevie
Mimi Mona Carlene Rasheeda funky Danny
feh whoever made sure she got her a damn
chick okay I'm just hanging out
I felt bad when I seen what happened
with Jocelyn's mother and how much of a
bitch she really was I mean I don't know
the woman like that to be calling her
nature like that but who else do I know
too early be governing my bitch like
that I'm just saying and take it as you
man but the way she treated her wasn't
exactly motherly if you ask me so yeah
that was kind of sad to see that her mom
did her like that if she went through
all that and you know dramas family
drama so it looks like stevie is not the
only person who got some Ariane lock
because apparently Jocelyn's culture
keeps him running back to the yard as
well so they kind of made for each other
like they like to bump uglies together
and thrive off each other it's very
nasty monkey sex we do it we do
everything we do it all we really need
is no condoms so I know for say they
nasty like that justice should be
pregnant
very soon as the next season airs just
yeah yeah okay
now all jokes aside what is with Shay in
that Detroit hair shows Sheneneh
shake and go half short 320 League well
she could've worn our big unit with the
the folk art and that would have looked
better I'm just saying though I'm not
saying I'm just saying my name I'll be
shameless but she hit a snowbank into
some fucking rusian blush he's been
playing with Barbie and shit girl come
he was on a contour her face with the
stage girl you
but France Dana aka Muffy mama wasn't
bad but intervention with the wigs for
real because that booze you did mama D's
old fucking non spelling ass want to
come and give advice to Chris shut up
I'm not the only one who caught that
scrappy said I called Shay when I ain't
got nobody else to holla at college damn
you just call her a back burner bitch on
national TV because that's all she good
for is to be there what I mean but that
seems to be a pattern with rap because
that's the same thing he does what Erica
and she want to marry him okay I will
say I am very very happy that Erica and
scrappy are getting married
but why scrappy had to say you want to
marry a nigga like what really is that
might be frozen today will you marry me
just don't work no more right oh good so
Stretch Armstrong aka Benzino I didn't
talk about him in my last room because
he's so irrelevant out with you don't go
hug but if we must he was just a cast
filler and karlie needed something to do
because you know her also important
career is just so booming she just
needed something extra on her plate one
thing I did like was the fact that
k.michelle did not she wasn't a hater
when Mona asked her about as far as
Rasheeda pick in her career over I mean
her love life over her career she
actually spit some room
you know shit and wasn't a hater
although you know them sue ain't really
too much or no friends but you give me
so let's just run down what we learnt
this season about this particular cast
Rashida cry is ugly as hell joseline
wore the same wig at least 10 times yes
the black shaking goes short one Shay
accompany joseline to the wig store in
order to get three toned
Detroit shake-and-go wig that she wore
at the reunion
just like Jocelyn's we accept joseline
citizen black Carly is messy Erica is
pretty confused
momma Dee is a really good father figure
all scrappy wanted this whole season was
for somebody to fill him that was it
Stevie J is as dirty as a bum in Central
Station Mimi is weak and weaker area
need a man and some damn business Mimi
says she was done a total of eight times
of this season and k.michelle had
officially 12 hairstyles dissed entire
season oh there were she doe
that was my review for the entire
reunion of love in hip-hop I must say
that the show is very entertaining Thank
You vh1 forgiven us something very
ratchet to watch on Monday nights Thank
You Mona scott-young for being such a
visionary with this isn't this whole
loving hip-hop conglomerate of a mess
and thank you all my Twitter people and
Facebook people and YouTube people will
watch me talk about these hot messes cuz
I might possibly be one of these people
one of these days and just I know it's
gonna be bad so yeah I think overall it
was a really good season I believe that
this season has surpassed New York New
York we'll be back as they said and this
they are getting the new season my
second season for season two of Atlanta
and season three of New York is coming
up it's well as Christie and gem show
which I won't be watching so yeah um if
I miss anybody that means to think we're
not relevant enough for me to talk about
I don't care about Kirk I don't care
about Benzino like good um so yeah if I
miss anybody
it really don't matter he wasn't me to
say something about mama D's misspelling
ass and you know she was a pimp she
could only spell money holes lube
condoms and FBI would you expect by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
