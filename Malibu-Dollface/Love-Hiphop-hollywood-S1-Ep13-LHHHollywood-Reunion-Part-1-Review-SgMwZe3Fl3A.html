Love &amp;amp; Hip Hop Hollywood we start this
episode off Mona's hosting there in New
York
I guess so she pretty much gives us a
back story of everything to happen this
entire season and they pretty much shoe
to each person of the cast and everybody
looks pretty dapper I must say however
some look better than others let me just
point out that Tiaras wig is horrible I
mean I just the color but the texture I
look like some good hair but it just the
whole moment just don't work for her the
color the curls the length all of it is
just wrong
but moniece she listened muddy hit the
roots with a nice little pressing calm
you see she was slicked she looked like
this she was slick Masika is wearing
Jimmy Neutron mama's hair and hazel is
well she's hazel so she introduces the
entire cast in the audience claps
extra-long for whatever reason so Mona
goes ahead and says that it's kind of
weird how everybody is interconnected
April's like whoo-whoo not me not my own
Maury Mitchell aren't we important none
of that they all laughed because I
pretty much know it's true so then she
goes ahead and she acts hazel it is
normal behavior for women to do this in
Hollywood like men do where they just
pretty much sleep with whoever and then
let it be what it is so she's like you
know it's kind of like a cold were you
just like you don't sleep with your
friends ex-boyfriends and before she
could say any fucking thing Berg says
but you for great oh so Ray's like you
really want to start this early this is
what you want to do like right now so at
the bergen Ray J go back and forth mana
axe hazel did you and Ray hook up she
says he hit it first in Hollywood when I
was in college and teairra knew that
she'll be like and they all laughing
like this is just normal behavior like
what the fuck people so the Mona goes
into her mana or her monologue about
everybody you know her voice and then
they roll the package on tear and raise
issues this season so they come back
from the package in them honest like
it's kind of potholes and your stories
here about you and Ray she's like
of course of eight years but everything
on matter any but because you said that
was delusional
so then ray decides he wants to be the
bigger person in the situation and he
starts to apologize and profusely and
was like you know what even after
watching is like I'm sorry like I'm
super sorry I mean I feel bad when I did
it after I did it or maybe in the middle
of when I did it but I still feel bad
though but watching it back I feel
horrible and I apologize to you see I
ain't never want to make you feel like
that like I apologize please forgive me
so she said yeah sidebar why is Tanisha
from the bad girls club
in the audience shouldn't you be over
there hosting a battle of the sexes of
something so he was like a week like are
we good good is she like
well three now well there we go so
Mona's like he seemed sincere do you
think that you gonna forgive him and
then he goes on to say I mean I feel bad
when I did it and then watching him back
though like I I feel bad like I feel
worse so I'm gonna decide she wants to
bring up the Box slash bag of Tiaras
that was like the type of the
conversation most of his fucking season
so then she was like you know what was
missing in the bag so cheer I was like
so hazed with charms and it was like it
it was a little bit time he was like I
know where the other Louboutin was like
ain't no fish Soulja Boy Nikki and
sincere are sitting on the couch and
laughing up a storm like little kids
acting a damn mess at a school assembly
so then Mona brings up the coochie cream
and Sierra's like but you can see that
in Tabasco you seen that on a picture to
his big ass bitch brought the fuck up
back when you see me so he was like
y'all y'all wait wait wait wait
like all I was wrong like no like that
was just wrong like let it go let it go
so they decide they want to introduce
princess this bitch comes on the stage
and tries to still fucking miss joseline
Hernandez chick from her last reunion
when she came an Aryan it was like hey
fake-ass bitch
so she comes on say what's up fake-ass
ho it was so bland like bitch you need
little salt if you gonna throw shade
bitch the book and it was towards Morgan
so Morgan was like oh you're talking
about yourself because you're the only
on the stage so you know the crowd is
out there instigating up as oh bitch did
you hear that what she acts her how is
she and raised relationship and she says
that they are working it out after you
know the little Dunkel situation they
broke up for like two weeks and then
they realized I really love each other
but everything is cool now so then they
roll what happened when that bitch you
know got bo Jackson and pull and raise
watching this shit like it is a movie he
like and this is the first time that
I've actually seen princess smile you
really realize it but the entire fuckin
season this bitch was on stone face like
she didn't do nothing but be upset so
they show all the way up to the end of
the last episode where you know reigns
here were kissing on the beach so
princess you know she wants to get the
clapping or whatever she like you know
that's real cute and this here was like
a me yeah so mana axe princess when she
surprised that Rey reconnected with Tara
and she said no because he told me and
he was like well I told her because she
was gonna see it anyway so what an axe
here so what happened after you and Ray
reconnected she was like she paused and
was like and then for the bitch could
say any fuckin thing hair come princess
nothing
tiara said enough and then princess goes
a whoa clearly not enough you see here
sitting with me Tara said bitch your
pasta to go jump on a date bitch so
princess was like oh I'm the prostitute
so whose dick was you choking on last
week so the audience is instigating it
again and then Ray J add to them was
like up up what so then princess fucking
throws the tea in our face it was like
burg wasn't she sucking on your dick
last week yes or no arranged it was like
like go ahead and say go ahead and be
honest so if that's the truth and birds
not denying it that means that burger
cheated on plastic lips with Tara so
tear in our princess are going back and
forth with the insults or whatever and
rays like you know hold on wait a minute
just keep the peace so teairra comes out
the cut and was like mommy that's that D
for you that Detroit is coming out and
she's ready so for instance was like
bitch you keep it cute you don't want I
got fuckin rhinestones on but in tiara
just takes her metal clutching chuck it
at that bitch so then ray gets up almost
he tries to play peacemaker
okay and was like stop stop didn't I
tell you to stop like for real like he
don't do something princess is like I'm
for that motherfucking wig off cheer we
said to Lina well then I wish you
motherfuckin would bitch pull it off I
guess I get out for like an intermission
or whatever and raised up brushing his
motherfucking hair talking about some
I'm I was nervous I was nervous I was
she had a knife or something okay I
thought I was the one hit with all of he
so I'm gonna ask here or why she said
that Ray J wasn't happy with princess
and she said today Morgan's like and did
I tell you that Jesse anything about
that she's so raised like stop lines
here and stop line you said that she
told you everything she was like so then
Morgan's in the back talking about oh my
mom arrested bees I swear I ain't say
nothing that girl about nothing that she
told me so ray and teairra goes back and
forth about who's really lying in said
situation
- then Mona changes the subject -
princess in the whole pool dunk
situation she like you know you were
trying to look like you shouldn't push
rain of whole but you ended up falling
in the bowl she was like I was then he
gonna say I used to play fag football or
whatever and I stutter stepped or
whatever and you know she fell in a hole
fizz over there sitting watching this
like you know when using school you
would laugh cuz your homeboy your
homegirl was all interacting a fucking
fool with all the teachers that's what
he's giving right now so then she acts
princess what did ray say to really piss
you off and get you to that point she
said we were talking about Morgan and
all of a sudden he started talking about
era and I feel like he brought that up
to get a reaction out of me and the
Mona's like well you brought a Floyd and
she's like well that was after he
brought up teairra like you gonna bring
up your ex I'm bringing my the ex I
don't care about Floyd so it don't
matter
chillin so then she asked Morgan about
the accusation that she made that
princess was on the phone with Floyd the
whole time that Ray J was in jail and
then Morgan really didn't confirm nor
deny if it was true or not so I don't
know
so then princess attempts to try to
clear up the situation and she lied and
so what happened was and then she just
stopped and then Ray was like go ahead
like say what you feel and she was like
I'm not to get upset and he was like
don't get upset if you got a cry cry
just do it real quick like okay fuck my
feelings right so one ice princess how
she felt when Ryan tear reconnected and
she said it was really she felt like it
was her fault and if it was genuine
between the two of them then it would
have happened a long time ago Tanisha
acts Morgan who was better for Ray and
Morgan's answer made no absolutely no
fucking sense I'm like she said Princess
twice maybe she meant teairra I don't
know if it's the way she said it all the
way to edit it but it just didn't make
any sense maybe I made something but he
did making sense he acts princess some
question and as Princess answers the
question ray lays on her or whatever
like a little kid and she was like I
love him unconditionally it doesn't
matter and I would never cheat on him
not he we will never cheat on each other
but I will never cheat on him so alright
good luck with y'all a little situation
girl so then we go to Bergen and hazel
and they wrote a package on their
tumultuous situation ship so after the
package melt Mona's like y'all got a
thing for throwing shit out of bags huh
and Hazel's respond to us because they
some bitch asses that's why so she's
like what is it hard seeing and watching
something like that happen to you from
somebody that you actually cared about
and loved and at this point hazel is
like a wounded bird aside from Nia Omari
in April and a little bit of fizz hazel
was the only person in the cast I feel
still was like a genuine person like had
a heart
anybody else too clearly seen harden
like they didn't really give a fuck
about nobody else's feelings so I do
like hazel I give her a nice little C+
for the season she she made me look at
her in a different way and I thought she
has a good heart she just doesn't pick
her friends very wisely so after she
decided she wants to answer she she
starts to cry and terra like okay yeah
right just kind of like just say how you
feel like say how you feel
so my sake is gonna say her car like she
did she cried on every fucking episode
of something
so hazel does what she does best when
she gets mad get the fucking screaming
and flailing and shit
and she said you shut the fuck up you
you thought what a mug shot
so masika's reply is you shut the fuck
up you 48 year old whore okay you shut
the fuck up you stay in your lane you
stay in your fucking lane with that nice
little vein right here looks like a girl
so they go back so Masika and hayes are
going back and forth acting like idiots
and then Masika says don't dress me
don't fucking undress me ho so all of
the side the hazel pops up jacking off
everything batch tell you something she
get the swinging him hands like is a
West Coast thing like when we get ready
to fight everything in our body just
pretty much go motherfucking limp and
whatever's gonna swing is gonna swing so
you know for the West Coast and
somebody's comes people you know I'm
dunno it's just as that ready I'm ready
to fight type of situation so of course
security steps in and then they kind of
regroup or whatever
so then Mona tells her be in the moment
being your feelings being however you
feel at this moment but be in your seat
bitch you're not in the right frame
being the seat bitch hazel listen cuz
you don't want to not get a check okay
so after they run the package of him in
and hazel she acts Berg do you feel bad
for what you did to hazel and he said
with them fingers and oh that thumb look
like a big toe he said I'm sorry but I'm
not sorry
he says she made up a fantasy about him
and I never told her that I was ever her
man and she was ever my girl only thing
I ever told her that she was was my
Melanie Fiona and my 4:00 a.m. and
that's a song about pretty much being a
side chick bitch that just that and he
don't understand why she just didn't get
that so Mona says this was the most
talked about relationship and before she
could fucking finish Masika gonna say
you mean situation ship so Hazel's like
shut the fuck up and you control your
holds Berg control your hos
so then for whatever reason she acts
fuckin whack-ass sincere with his
fucking blue velvet on his opinion and
he pretty much throws bucco shade and
Hazel and gonna say it's too pretty in
so many words my paraphrase here it's
too many fly bitches in Hollywood new
hot 21 year olds and while I was just
trying to figure out why the fuck is he
fucking with his lead so Mona was like
she is a beautiful girl and he gonna say
yeah okay but she look too old for what
he was trying to do here and trying to
settle down like that well Hazel's like
well I'm only four years older than him
so what are you talking about so then
she gets in on mad and she says well the
reason when he cashes out because his
dick is so little he needs something to
compensate for what you know his little
pint-sized little situation
Berg is defending the little meet and I
know that scheana lyin cuz y'all like to
send me the fucking screenshots and
pictures of this man's situation on my
fuckin Instagram all the time I got it
I've seen it she was like it could fit
in my nostril I probably should fit my
nostril so mother's asked the question
that we all want to know if it was so
damn little why did you say but has a
replies and was like Terra didn't I
always tell you that Berg had a little
fun size dick so Tara was like she said
no can you just have my back for once
just for one thing can you have my back
yes Mona's like a fun sized dick I
cannot with you bitches not today
Mona finally gets today I'm joke but
then Berg goes to defending his little
meat and was like what you know
chicks always want to do that they've
like oh yeah what rage a dick is little
and this is that yep so Roger was like
oh you ain't never gotta say that shit
about my dick you ain't never gotta say
ever
hazel like that ain't true now I don't
know where the fuck you got that from
was that ain't true
so then hazel explains we met in oh six
he was a rapper I was a publicist when
he brought his first house she was there
when she wanted to do her music thing he
was there they was messing around for a
course of eight years on and off but it
wasn't eight years of hazel just chasing
after Berg Masika is over there she is
each and she is panting and she is
giving us faces cuz she cheat each into
so something so she axes Berg do you
feel like you Oh hazel an apology
he gives the screw face and he was like
and I hate when people do this I
apologize if you took it that way then
you could you could elected at I
apologize but because you took it that
way as the problem so then we go to
hazel and her fraud friendships so that
the whole entire package is with hazel
fucking masika's poster up and she says
and that's the closest you'll ever get
to touching man Mona asked her you lost
a lot of friends over Berg was it worth
it so Masika makes it known we were
never friends
so then hazel says well clearly we were
never friends and as far as me and TT is
concerned we didn't really fall out over
bird Mona's like well she didn't want to
support your relationship with Berg and
issues all that one thing you can say
that then so yes bitch she did fall out
with her over Berg so then they're
touching and they're having and then
Mona's like oh you guys are having a
little moment right now and it's you
like because we love each other so then
my secret say oh please she's just
trying to trend she's so fucking
ruthless
okay the bitch came for a fight so then
hazel says I'm gonna be trending for
dragging your ass across this stage Mona
said not this stage so they go back and
forth and innate hazel calls Masika a
whore and Masika said whore
or let me not go down your list girl
bitch good luck
so then mana X Nikki heartache onset
situation and Nikki pretty much lets us
know that the showing is real as we
thought it was side note can I just say
that Miss Nikki murders looks everything
on this from the cutout dress to the
silicone body but it's looking and
sitting right her hair she ain't got
that mullet on more like that really
slicked it and did what the fuck they
were supposed to do where the shoutout
to that face looking at her matte red
lipstick is nice everything that bitch
is ready and she looks everything only
from what nobody's saying so she says
you're sitting on friends all night but
if you filming with somebody and you say
they're your friend and then you turn
around and go sleep with the same man
then people are gonna know people only
go by what we've showed them okay it's
perception they don't know what's in
real life so they like if she was
filming with her then that means that
they're friends we put out there but we
portray Manar gonna say well I hope you
portray your real life exactly so if you
fill me with her and you say that your
friends don't say that you're not
friends now and turn right and sleep
with the man don't do that
erasure gives her a little pound like
bitch I agree you correct in all of what
you just said mana X Nikki you recently
bounded with hazel is that because of
y'all you know equal hate for Masika she
said abso-fucking-lutely Masika chimes
in and says well i mean ii went to white
bitches coming together it's only August
another girl bitch was like who he's
talking to wish I could buy your life
know that the crowd starts applauding
like you know that bitch is right Ray
J's faces like whoo shit bitches you
know the vision okay she's not lying
then she says I'll throw a psyche at you
if I feel bad for you bitch so then my
secret the size of the sheet erectus
wish to filth in one line that she has
selective amnesia she don't she has
selective hearing right now she doesn't
remember she can't hear anything that
she said then Nikki goes forward to
saying and the only reason why you stay
at the W is because you hope for a
living bitch everybody was like bitching
about you all get away with that
so my ax Nikki how long her and Molly
were together before they broke
and she said they were together for a
year and a half but then he was like in
the studio so much and he couldn't
really pay her any attention and she
just felt like you know she took flight
and I get no attention girl for you so
um she just decided that they were going
to break up and everyone go their
separate ways or whatever but she didn't
take it as serious because they always
did they will break up and make a break
you know how people doing relationships
I've done you break up you make up you
give it you know it's just it's a thing
because you get tired of somebody just
need a little moment instead of saying I
need a moment bitches just break the
fuck up let me just mind you as well
Nicki's mama Michelle murderuss is on
the stage this bitch got on her blackest
black lip liner on her eyebrows her nice
little top knot ponytail with the back
down and her pumpkin or mez suit and she
look like she's out for blood with her
cadaver makeup on okay they actin akise
mom her opinion and she said I did not
have a issue until she started to put
pictures on her Instagram and tag Nicki
in those pictures so my secret said I've
never done that a day of my life we
talking about Nicky's mom was like so
you didn't do that to my daughter you're
gonna you reverse it up in here and lie
huh you're gonna sit here and lie she
said let me ask you a question she's not
going for it why did you do that to my
daughter
on Instagram she said aren't you too old
to be on Instagram aren't you too old
for Instagram so Nicky gets up and was
like I bitch don't talk about my mind
bitch
don't talk about my coz I've been ready
to fuck you up bitch I'll be talking
about my mom like that so Morgan's over
here tell him a secret to chill the fuck
out and Masika ignoring the fuck out of
her she just like I are she is she
serious right girl if she really serious
so Nicky and her mom are cutting the
fuck up they both are yelling in two
different fucking languages both
customers bitch out and two fucking
different languages so yeah
and Masika just like isn't she like 70
like are you serious who grandmother
talks like that her mom said I give you
a run for your life bitch Masika say
what old bitch speaks like that is she
serious mom is like oh my god Michelle
relax babe
like cool the fuck down so then her mama
says I take my clothes off you take your
clothes off and we'll see who get a run
for their money bitch so Masika gets
everyone's like did a seven-year-old let
me just say that she's gonna take off
her clothes like really is this what
we're going to do princess and Ray J are
rolling Soulja Boy like he loves in this
shit he like this a my drama engine is
interesting as fuck her mom isn't rip
this bitch's keep going I want to keep
going on and Nikki like mom shut up shut
up stop talking shut up so after the
commercial they come back and there is a
notice to on the screen and I'm going to
read exactly what they said ABAB a time
okay after the taping of the reunion
young boy was arrested in connection
with an alleged assault to his
girlfriend Masika Tucker based on the
severity of the allegations against
Youngberg vh1 immediately terminated its
relationship with him
vh1 does not condone domestic violence
so in other words Bergy got fired so
then we come back into Masika walks to
one of the producers and was like it's
grandma serious like are you sure it's
gross errors so Mona's like we cannot
yell because if we yell we're never
gonna get to the truth so shut the fuck
up so then she asked Nikki why the
hair-pulling was a dead giveaway when
she was talking to Masika about having
sex with Molly so then she's like you
know what I don't even think it was a
dead giveaway anymore because he fucked
three other bitches when he was with
that bitch and one of the bitches and
his same bed as that bitch so it's like
she's trying to one-up Masika by saying
that you know you what you was one of
many but it just made her look bad cuz
like okay so you know that he's just a
ho and you can see you two can take him
back in y'all continue to go back and
forth
she said molly was very open about the
girls that he had slept with when they
were broken up so she were trying to
figure out why is he lying or just her
she just another bitch on the fucking
totem pole so Nikki was like so what I
hit you up and as she said when you were
stalking me huh is that what you mean
when you're stalking me I go back and
forth about that shit for about a good
five minutes and then they get back to
the point which was she said when I
spent with you about Molly what did I
say I said my problem with
he has a lot of women that is what I
said to you so I was trying to figure
out why he was lying about her because
she wasn't nothing but just another
bitch like I said on the list so their
mana axes Masika why do you feel like
Nikki had an issue with believing the
things that you said she said my issue
with nikki is that nikki is so insecure
and when you've had so many surgeries
done before she could get to her
pointing is that bitch you guys hungry
down to bitch but it don't look good and
your lip does not move baby girl
so Nikki's mom is on the side and she
like cabbage is dog cabbage a plastic
dog and all its other stuff but you want
to be just like her you want to be just
like her you wish to be like her look
like her all day long I'm not arguing
with someone's grandma I'm said you
can't kiss my ass all day long bitch
Mona's like oh my goodness really like
shut up get your mama security so Masika
takes the floor and says my mother
taught me how to be respectful to my
elders so I'm not gonna argue with
someone who's old enough to be my
mother's mother she should be at home
knitting and do a macrame meanwhile
she's in 27 year olds business for no
reason whatever issues I have with Nikki
or between me and Nikki not me and Nana
stay in your lane bitch so Nikki and
Masika go back and forth about who smash
tools man after what situation after
Masika brought a fizz's name and then
molly then nikki says Masika you're the
real MVP because you did porn and you're
still broke
then Nikki mama started popping off some
shit about porn or whatever and then
masika's like grandma calm down your
blood pressure your pressure you don't
want to get your pressure calm the fuck
down she keeps on popping at Masika like
bitching at me - I will fuck your life
up bitch I will fuck your like she said
Nana oh my god never you're Memphis so
far oh my goodness
they just Simona just gets over it and
was like let's just introduce Molly more
why nice so he comes out like he just
put his jacket on wrong
he and
he gets up to greet him and she's like
all Masika you want to look at my ass I
know you obsessed with it right you want
to look at my ass
Masika make some home depot dig about
her ass or whatever and then her mom is
still up over there in her own little
world going off talking about some it
take more bitches to get up under my
skin than that bitch you take a million
bitches so that her mom just starts
going on is tangent about Hugh Hefner
and taking off clothes and all of this
other shit so masika's like all right do
it check it off man I took it does
anybody got a ones for Dana Nana one
it's work go ahead and girl chalk it up
so Mona's like Masika be respectful be
