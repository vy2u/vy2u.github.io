so this hair which is 28 inches by the
way and it's from a al Express company
called loving hair I don't believe I
work with living here before I could
have bad overhaul um and this is their
Brazilian straight girl with an 18 inch
of frontal why you playing okay
so you guys know always bring up my
little sister right and she always be
lying to people telling her when they
watch my videos that she was the
inspiration or she came up with this
look for a particular hairstyle that I
have she tried it with the sole touch me
she did it okay so before I said with
you I just want to give you guys a
little bit of background and you guys
notice what my things my intro song was
cuz we all looked I you know right so I
I don't know if you guys die shish so
that this look is definitely
representing an inspiration from the
early 2000 so this is when black came
out where they came on 99 so it was
around black time TLC came out came back
out during his time a group called
before dark
hi Mia
with a girl group that was based here in
Los Angeles they went to a school called
palisade and they were a trio and they
had a song that most of you guys with
know called Monica now only I was
happening to be I brought their album
which is called a dreaming which is one
of my favorite albums from the 2000 I
gotta listen and they have a that when a
Monica's single came out one of the
girls in the room name is Ginny G and on
the front coverage and he was in the
middle her hair looked just like this
and this is when everybody here was
crazy straight if you watches like
shinies videos during that time
everything was so futuristic that she
would have a girl with bone straight
hair and two pigtails and I thought this
would be a perfect thing to do
especially with the frontal so I went
ahead and did it and he came out just
like this and I have to say this is so
fun and this is something that I haven't
done and everybody is doing different
stuff and again this is a very childish
ellipse but I love everything about it
and it definitely gives me black and
away it gives me black album cover oh it
is everything that was going on during
that time so so I don't know some air
okay so this is three bundles three guys
three bundles of 28-inch and then of
course like I told you I have a 18 inch
responsible end
as well and I will say I am in love like
they did that shout out the lesson here
I'm remember that's a raven when Corey
was in that group and I forgot was call
but they had two songs it was loving the
feeling and feeling the love yeah that's
what I'm feeling so so the actual hair
is 28 inches let me get myself school my
outfit too is very mm so my ends I did
not strained I let all of this hair air
dry with the exception of my frontal I
actually are straight my frontal but I
left the ends just like it is so this is
how thick it is it's not very thick at
all but for this particular hairstyle it
works for every day if you're a person
who likes long hair but you don't like
your hair to be
me to hold this would be perfect if
you're a person who's not really into
every sick hair like like I know now a
lot of us we like to wear like 85
bundles but if you're not into the whole
85 bundle get down then this definitely
would suffice for sure our tracks
actually stop right here in the back and
then all of this right here is my front
so I have absolutely positively no hair
out in the front of this is man all of
this is the actual frontal and I'm like
very like I'm shocked cuz it didn't take
me long to do at all and I hadn't
learned his hair just bone straight
because it was debris bundles and I was
trying to kind of get used to it
and then I'm like okay so the review
needs to go up this week which was
supposed to be last week and I was going
to go ahead and do and then my whole
schedule got pushed back so the other
day I was you know going through my my
storage and I found my before dark
Monica single and I was like her hair is
so cute so I put a picture of what her
hair look like it is much more wearable
than mine Z if mine is definitely very
TLC ish but remember in the early 2000s
everybody had a big like really bright
background and everybody would wear
overalls because that was just a new hot
thing but it had to be a futuristic
overall and then everybody had to have
gloss on a list with some bone straight
hair sometimes that's what I'm feeling
okay very bewitched
very dream very TLC very 3lw that's what
I'm getting right now but overall I will
I will give this hair a 10 out of 10 I'm
loving it
thank you living here I'm loving it
there's nothing wrong with this hair at
all the luster that you see in it I
didn't put nothing in this hair like
nothing I Flatiron only the frontal so
that means that everything here in the
back all it is the luster that you see
in back here is what this is after a
co-wash okay that's it I didn't do
anything to this hair that was extra I
didn't do anything to it that required
me to do so much of anything and I like
I just said I didn't slide on the end
because I didn't feel like it needs it
at all now if I wanted to go like I
might shoot something in this and
obviously I would make sure that my
interest rate is possible to give you
the full logo but only because I'm
shooting from here up it really wasn't
necessary and the little s he should put
on here for whatever reason then that's
the great because you're just doing it
just for the hell of it so I definitely
will recommend this hair this is someone
to do a style like this you need a good
frontal and this frontal is really
really good guys like they did that okay
I did Lisa not for this I didn't um they
didn't come bleach but the front did
come pre plucked so I don't think it was
pretty plus more so I think it was the
fact that it had a natural hairline I
did receive a frontal the other day
though that I did have to plug and I had
the company of them was like um don't
y'all think y'all should start selling
free clothes or at least not giving me
because it was edged up okay it looks
like a Steve Harvey lining anybody's on
do that so I went ahead and plucked out
one but this one definitely came with a
nice natural hair line and I cut the
baby here into it which this is probably
one of the only times we're having a lot
of baby here is okay okay we're just
kind of drizzle down your face and I've
seen worse than this on people who have
wraps and I'm like girl you're doing the
absolute most but I love this I love
that a lot of this and again is one of
those I just was 360 tubers so I have
six elastics in my hair all together I
didn't use rubber bands just because I
didn't want to tear the hair at all so
these elastics actually are from you
know you gotta firstly want to be how
like that been and make you spend all
your extra little gas money I went in
there and they have like a whole thing
of them and I just use those or whatever
these are the more Demerol ones that I
use on their black and say like two
dollars for like 25 so yeah love in here
I'm good I'm good guys so mothers are
once this week so I'm going to give it
to her because she is she should killing
me right now
so I'm gonna give her this week because
I can do this doll again but I did what
I did was I
just went ahead and parted it right here
which as you can see it's not even
because I did it on my mannequin head as
opposed to my head but I parted it and
then just part the side and then just
swooped it in swooped it in pulls the
baby here out cut the baby hair to make
sure that it was and separated from the
rest of this and then I took my guys to
be glued and just took it and with my
baby here too were saying yes my same
baby here - worse than I had in my baby
hair tutorial that red one that's the
one that's the og that I only use
because that's the only one that works
and I just went through put a little
baby here and then again it just makes
it look that much more natural looks
like I went and just flick all my hair
we're in actuality ain't none of my hair
oh so it's acting perfecting to do but
once you get it then of course you get
better and better America I think we all
do so thank you guys for watching I hope
you guys enjoyed this and tell me what
is your favorite song from the 2000
