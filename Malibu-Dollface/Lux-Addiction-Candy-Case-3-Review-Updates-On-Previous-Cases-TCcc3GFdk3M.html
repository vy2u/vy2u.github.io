a review for Lex addiction and as you
guys know I've done previous videos
Horlicks addiction in the past and I
wanted to talk about the newer case that
I pretty much got think about two and a
half weeks ago I've had the case for
quite some time and a lot of people were
asking me you know have your rhinestones
fell off what experiences have you had
whatever happened to the infamous tin
can fit you first got so when no further
ado this is the pink case that I got
interested Couture case and to prove
it's the one I had the first time is
that decrepit mermaids that I hate are
just kids during this mermaid but other
than that I love this case I really
didn't have any issues with this one in
particular I think due to the simple
fact that the rise over huge compared to
the one I have right now and it's nice
you know it's pretty it's pink any girls
dream this is for my thinking generation
iPod Touch this was not for that I
didn't get the third one I currently
have the fourth one that's two newest
one and it's hey it's still intact it
still works
it's no issues the chain on it you know
still is intact nothing's came off so
the pink case is good now as you guys
know the second case that I ended up
getting after I buy that one for about
three well three months I guess you
could say and then the new iPod fish
came out and I was like um when and get
it but I don't have a case I had a
rubber case on it and you guys could
know in my last review that I did um I
had a rubber case on it for a while so
nothing could happen to my iPod check
that off I got the gold and black case
which is this case and I like it I love
this case but I did run into issues with
this case and I wanted to express that I
wanted to be very honest about you know
this even though I'm doing a review I'm
going to be honest about it and I won't
say that it sincerely the company
that's the issue I think it was more so
of me not being careful and I'm going to
tell you why the difference between this
case in this case is not the cases it's
really the iPod design the vessel part
were in which your volume markers are
right here that means that this
particular part is the same size as all
of this except for here all of you guys
can see that now on this particular one
the bezel part here is much thinner as
you can see then this one is so in doing
that the rhinestones are smaller meaning
it's only one row of rhinestones here
versus how many instance this is like
three right three rows of rhinestones on
this side so if you have more
rhinestones meaning you have more space
it's it's less I can do more of this and
nothing will come off this only has one
so I would have to be careful in which
moving my hands in this area and when I
had to basically go over all the way to
the side I kept pressing this right here
so these two you know when will
expressed so much it will basically give
and it gave those two rhinestones before
so rest in peace to those rhinestones
but um other than that I didn't have any
issues with all and the second thing was
also what's my fault I was out I have my
pot plane in the car me and Tiffany were
somewhere and I put my ipod in her purse
and the bow that was right here at the
top that was black and cracked in half
and once one half of the pole was in
person that half was that again and I
want to basically be very clear about
this um my cousin has the exact same
case she does not put in she never put
it in her purse she's always kept it in
her car in her hand or dresser you know
and her case is intact mind you I've
never done of this stuff came off on the
bag no rhinestones in the back popped
off or anything but
because the front is a bit fragile
because of the iPod being much thinner
than this heroin you know this has a bow
too but this bow never pops off or broke
or anything is because of the simple
fact that I never manhandle disciplines
like I did this one and I won't I won't
lie I'm gonna be honest I did manhandle
that you guys I have to understand when
you guys buy these cases because some
people were complaining that their cases
were the rhizomes are popping off if
you're not if they're fault if you
they're falling on the floor if you're
throwing them in your purse if you're
throwing them on your bed if you're you
know they're falling off your dresser
things are going to pop off they're not
indestructible they're phone cases
they're iPod cases there are not paper
weights you know they're not things of
that nature then a crystal Roz is where
you know they may possibly own up break
so you have to be very careful because
you're paying for something that is
handmade and very custom if it's
handmade that meaning can break it can
you know that's why it does come with an
extra thing of rhinestones because human
error is something that we cannot
prevent you know so I want you guys to
keep that in mind they're not
indestructible and I understood that
going into it you know because I did
purchase one with my own money for my
sister and my cousin so you know and
they still have there was no problem and
the newest case that I do have which is
this particular case and as you guys can
see the difference already off the bat
between the previous two cases is that
they don't this one does not have
rhinestones here or rhinestones in this
area everything is missing out of that
area which I like I requested this case
after I did so much damage to that there
go to the all-black case arrested
requested this new case because I said I
wanted something that was different
so that's the front and this is the back
of it and it has its candy and all of
the candy on it is pretty much it's
squishing so all of this stuff feels
like real candy on the back of here all
the icing that's on the back or the
icing that's running down the sides all
of that feels like rubbery and the
reason why I like that is because you
guys know
the difference between this iPod which
is the iPod Touch 2nd generation in this
iPod Touch which the iPod for generation
is that this one is thicker meaning the
case is thicker it may not it may look
the same but that's because this one has
more stuff on the back but let's - this
stuff out that's how big the actual iPod
is I should have took it off but yeah
and these cases are a bit difficult in
my opinion to take on and put off
without ruining something because I've
had to use key my keys to get in between
they snap on very well they don't pop
off that's the shore but taking the
morning off when every time I do it is
usually a hassle um so yeah maybe not
for you but for me I have a removable
issues with trying to take them off I'm
never like broke them or anything but it
just take me a minute
maybe I'm just slow I don't know who or
maybe that's what this fine little piece
for who knows but yeah I love the back
of it I love the arm all of the candy
and all of that good stuff
this it took them a while to send me
this case because it was custom when I
requested it she said they didn't have
any more of these little trinkets on
them back um you know because they have
a new line of fully squassi crystal ipod
touch cases and you know iPhone 4s and
all that good stuff so yeah these cases
are not these cases that happened to me
$79.99 are not wondrous Rossie crystals
they have them in there but some of
these are just simply regular iPhones
the ones that are fully crystals cost
more those are like one hundred and
something dollars or one another they
also do iPads some people were
complaining that they didn't aisle
couldn't find their they didn't have
their model for this and I think you
guys have to know from my understanding
that you guys can email them at let's
see which is sales at Lux addiction
accom here's the car which is think with
your a package and you guys know I've
done reviews on this and when you get it
used
comes in a box like this it intersects
with you because another review I'm
doing it to the third and most likely
this is the last review I'm actually
doing for this company because there's
not really much more that I can show you
I don't have an iPad so I can't show you
an iPad case or anything and when you
get them in the mail in that particular
box they come in you know the famed
bubble wrap I love so much as well as
the front and back pieces come with
plastic wrap the damage you can see they
have my names on them to know that
they're at their minds and of whatnot um
so you know I have ample protection and
you can actually store I store my old
ones and these and put them in a box and
put them away so yeah I pretty much
don't have any issues I've had this case
for thus far and nothing fell off I'm
not having I don't know why but I'm not
having the same issues here that I was
having with the other case so I'm not
pretty maybe it's me being a little more
gentle about it and being a little less
careless with the device itself um so
yeah um the screen protector that I have
on here I got off amazon.com I think I
like six of them for like two dollars or
something so yeah it's clear and when
you press the end on but in everything
you can see just fine and yes that is
Dario cuz you guys know I love to argue
and yes my little kids was inspired by
Daria if you read the description so
yeah that's about it if you guys have
any questions I don't believe that I'm
leaving out anything for more
information you know to purchase the
case or get inquiries about the case you
guys can go to Luke's addiction comm you
guys can call them as well at one three
two three five seven zero zero six eight
eight to talk to somebody directly if
you have any questions before buying or
if you want to have it as a gift or
something and you're not necessarily
sure or to see if they have that
particular model it's best to call like
I said you guys can email at sales at
lux addiction calm and that's about it
you guys have any questions or anything
about my previous cases or any
experiences that I had that I didn't
cover please feel free below to get me
up
and asked me um and I think that's about
it uh so yeah right now the case I have
I love it I get compliments all the time
and I'm sticking with that one because
that one's the comfortable is for me and
I love that good old rubber grip so I
talk to you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
