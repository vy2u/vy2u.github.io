a review for Lex addiction and as you
guys know I've done previous videos or
looks addiction in the past and I wanted
to talk about the newer case that are
pretty much got think about two and a
half weeks ago I've had the case for
quite some time and a lot of people were
asking me you know have your rhinestones
fell off what experiences have you had
whatever happened to the infamous pink &amp;amp;
Fitch you first got so with no further
ado this is the pink case that I got the
Juicy Couture case and to prove it's the
one I had the first time is that
decrepit mermaids that I hate I just
kids during this mermaid but other than
that I love this case I really didn't
have any issues with this one in
particular I think due to simple fact
that the rice / huge compared to the one
I have right now and it's nice you know
it's pretty it's pink any girls dream
this is for my second generation ipod
touch this was not for that I didn't get
the third one I currently have the
fourth one that's newest one and it's
hey it's still intact it still works
it's no issues the chain on it you know
still is intact nothing's came off so
the pink case is good don't you guys
know the second case that I ended up
getting after I a hot oven for about 30
three months I guess you could say and
then the new ipod fish came out and I
was like um when and get it but I don't
have a case I had a rubber case on it as
you guys could know in my last review
that I did um I had a rubber case on it
for a while so nothing could happen to
my ipod tick that off I got the gold and
black case which is this case and I like
it I love this case but I did run into
issues with this case and I wanted to
express that i wanted to be very honest
about you know this even though I'm am
doing a review i'm going to be honest
about it and i won't say that it
sincerely the company
that the issue I think it was more so of
me not being careful and I'm going to
tell you why the difference between this
case in this case is not the cases it's
really the ipod design the vessel part
were in which your volume markers are
right here that means that this
particular part is the same size as all
of this except for here all the guys can
see that now on this particular one the
bezel part here is much thinner as you
can see then this one is so in doing
that the rhinestones are smaller meaning
it's only one row of rhinestones here
versus how many instance this is like
three right three rolls of rhinestones
on this side so if you have more
rhinestones meaning you have more space
it's it's less I can do more of this and
nothing will come off this only has one
so i would have to be careful in which
movie my hands in this area and when i
had to basically go over all the way to
the side i kept pressing this right here
so these two you know when we'll
expressed so much it will basically give
and it gave those to rhinestones before
so rest in peace to those rhinestones
but um other than that i didn't have any
issues with oh and the second thing was
also was my fault i was out i have my
pot plane in the car me and Tiffany were
somewhere and i put my ipod in her purse
and bow that was right here at the top
that was black it cracked in half and
once one half of the PO was in person
that half was that again and i want to
basically be very clear about this um my
cousin has the exact same case she does
not put then she never put it in her
purse she's always kept it in her car in
her hand or dresser you know and her
case is intact mind you I've never done
of this stuff came off on her back no
rhinestones in the back popped off for
anything but
because the front is a bit fragile
because of the ipod being much thinner
than this heroin you know this has a
boat too but this boy never popped off
or broke or anything is because it's
simple fact that I never man handle this
one like I did this one and i won't i
won't lie i'm going to be honest I did
man handle that you guys I have to
understand when you guys buy these cases
because some people were complaining
that their cases were the right stones
are popping off if you're not if their
fault if you they're falling on the
floor if you're throwing them in your
purse if you're throwing them on your
bed if you're you know they're falling
off your dresser things are going to pop
off they're not indestructible their
phone cases their ipod cases there are
not paperweights you know they're not
things of that nature then crystal balls
is where you know they may possibly are
not break so you have to be very careful
because you're paying for something that
is handmade and very custom if it's
handmade that meaning can break it can
you know that's why it does come with an
extra thing of rhinestones because human
error is something that we cannot
prevent you know so I want you guys to
keep that in mind think they're not
indestructible and I understood that
going into it you know because I did
purchase one with my own money for my
sister and my cousin so you know and
they still have there was no problem and
the newest case that i do have which is
this particular case and as you guys can
see the difference already off the bat
between the previous two cases is that
they don't this one does not have
rhinestones here or rhinestones in this
area everything is missing out of that
area which I like I requested this case
after i did so much damage to that their
gold at all black case arrested
requested this new case because i said i
wanted something that was different so
that's the front and this is the back of
it and it has its candy and all of the
candy on it is pretty much is squishing
so all of this stuff feels like real
candy on the back of here all the icing
that's on the back or the icing that's
running down the sides all of that feels
like rubbery and the reason why i like
that is because you guys know
the difference between this ipod which
is the ipod touch 2nd generation in this
ipod touch with skype or generation is
that this one is thicker meaning the
case is thicker it may not it may look
the same but that's because this one has
more stuff on the back but let's minus
this stuff out that's how big the actual
ipod is i should have took it off but
yeah and these cases are a bit difficult
in my opinion to take on and put off
without ruining something because i've
had to use key my keys to get in between
they snap on very well they don't pop
off that's the shore but taking the
morning off when every time i do it is
usually a hassle um so yeah maybe not
for you but for me i have a removable
issues with trying to say come I've
never like broke them or anything but it
did take me a minute maybe I'm just low
I don't know who or maybe that's what
this fine little piece for who knows but
yeah I love the back of it i love the
arm all of the candy and all of that
good stuff this it took them a while to
send me this case because it was custom
when I requested it she said they didn't
have any more of these little trinkets
on them back um you know because they
have a new line of fully scruffy crystal
ipod touch cases and you know iphone
forest and all of that good stuff so
yeah these cases are not these cases
that happen to me 7999 are not wondrous
wasi crystals they have them in there
but some of these are just simply
regular iPhones the ones that are fully
crystals costs more those are like 100
and something dollars or one another
they also do iPads some of people were
complaining that they didn't I'll
couldn't find their they didn't have
their model for this and I think you
guys have to know from my understanding
that you guys can email them at let's
see which is sales at lux addiction
accom here's the car which is sync with
your a package and you guys know I've
done reviews on this when you get it you
comes in a box like this intersects with
you because another review I'm doing it
to the third and most likely this is the
last review i'm actually doing for this
company because there's not really much
more that i can show you i don't have an
iPad so I can't show you an ipad case or
anything and when you get them in the
mail in that particular box they come in
you know the famed bubble wrap I love so
much as well as the front and back
pieces come with plastic wrap the damage
you can see they have my names on them
to know that they're at their minds and
whatnot so you know I have ample
protection and you can actually store I
store my old ones and these and put them
in a box and put them away so yeah I
pretty much don't have any issues i've
had this case for thus far and nothing's
fell off I'm not having I don't know why
but I'm not having the same issues here
that I was happening with the other case
so I'm not for maybe it's me being a
little more gentle about it and being a
little less careless with the device
itself um so yeah I'm the screen
protector that I have one here I got off
amazon.com I think I like 67 for like
two dollars or something so yeah it's
clear when you press the end on but in
everything you can see just fine and yes
that is Dario because you guys know I
love to argue and yes my local kids was
inspired by Daria if you read the
description so yeah that's about if you
guys have any questions I don't believe
that I'm leaving out anything for more
information you know to purchase the
case or get inquiries about the case you
guys can go to Luke's addiction calm you
guys can call them as well at 132 357 00
688 to talk to somebody directly if you
have any questions before buying or if
you want to have it as a gift or
something and you're not necessarily
sure or to see if they have that
particular model is best to call like I
said you guys can email at sales at lux
addiction calm and that's about it you
guys have any questions or anything
about my previous cases or any
experiences that I had that I didn't
cover please feel free below to hit me
up
and asked me um and I think that's about
it uh so yeah right now the case i have
i love it i get compliments all the time
and i'm sticking with that one because

talk to you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
