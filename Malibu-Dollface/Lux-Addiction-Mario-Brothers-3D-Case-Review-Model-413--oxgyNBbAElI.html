videos cuz I know I've been going for a
minute and I'll explain it and another I
like again like I said in the previous
video um but I'm gonna do a review I
know laughs Lux addiction video I said I
said this would be the last review that
I was gonna do that's because I was
doing them for my iPod at the time and I
had a black beard of time you already
know that stories that we're gonna be
there um but yeah um but I think they
had new cases new 3d cases on their site
and I just was like oh my god like I
have to do reviewing this cuz you guys
have to know about this like seriously
um so as you guys know when they
the boxes for my new subscribers hello
how are you guys
thank you for coming thank you for
watching um the boxes come usually like
this but usually they're not this large
usually they stop about here but this
one is larger because of the content
that was in it um and as you guys know
that comes with all of the labels and
stuff like that and it comes with excuse
me this is what the actual case within
when I got it don't know I love my
bubble wrap came with Alex addiction
card and the actual case was in this
sleeve when I got it here are the extra
gyms and whatnot so if anything ever
falls off you know like I said in pretty
already know the routine you already got
a routine for those who are new the
links to those videos will be at the
bottom in the description with a detail
bar so you guys can watch that now this
is the case now what I've seen this you
know all my cases have been pink or
clear or silver something saltines or
something a little bit different and who
doesn't love this guy so this is the
case which is
Mario from Super Mario Brothers this is
for my iPhone how the iPhone 4s and I
will explain that situation to y'all
later
yeah this is the case um and this is the
front of the case now I have a thing
about people who have okay oh you can
see me I'm using it on my iPod - I mean
I'm using my ipod to record this mind
you um yeah it stupid case um it's the
front in the back now I thought because
I had a white iPhone that it was
possibly gonna be it would look funny
because the whole entire thing is black
but here she doesn't look bad if you I'm
sure if you had a black phone all of
this would just be black you know you
know all of this up in here what you
probably can't see but yeah all of that
and this part here would be black so it
would be much sleeker or whatever but no
they got a little silver and this
whiteness around his his gloves and had
more all that good stuff
um now I've had this case mind you I got
that i pre-ordered the iPhone 4s so it
came on the 14th and our pre-order on 7
I had this case for approximately two
weeks in a few days and I will tell you
I feel much more secure with this case
in my other previous cases and the
reason is they use big rhinestones
around here this part is the part this
bezel part on the side is a I always
have issues with this because I'm always
typing and intensive on an iPod because
it's sleeker they make the rhinestones
on this side a little bit smaller so
since everything is the same size and
these just feel for whatever reason the
other ones felt secure but for whatever
reason this one feels way more secure
then other ones did um it just feels
like this is not gonna go anywhere like
I just feel like if I drop it on the
floor at an angle eight to hit the floor
not outside when they hit the carpet um
and nothing's popped off like seriously
I've had this case for two weeks and I
mean what's different between this and
my iPod is that my ipod is for my music
purposes only this is for everyday I'm
using this come on Twitter every time
taking phone pause I'm texting all that
stuff I'm using this phone so you know
when you're on it you can be real cute
you know hello um yeah you can you get
rural - it's in the Sun I let me tell
y'all happened I was at the club right
and the lights from the club was hitting
this it was so sparkly it's not even
like right now a camera you can't tell
by just a little light that I'm getting
right in you because it's early it's
12:15 you know so it's really early but
when light hits this it's ridiculous
like ridiculous now I don't know if
these are sriracha crystals but they
sure do shine like them
if so but I believe that they are
because II it's really SuperDuper shiny
um and it's a 3d case so the side of him
for troops out of the case it's not flat
which I love about this case because I
can put this in my pocket but it'll only
go up to here
so if I'm walking around you see all of
this glitter knees you know on either my
foot or on my front thigh um so yeah I
really really do enjoy this case this is
my favorite thus far out of all my cases
that I've gotten from Lux addiction this
by far is my favorite I'm not saying
it's just because they give me this case
but I'm honestly saying this from my
hearts of hearts but other cases I love
I still love them I still use them but
those are from my iPod it's different
when it is for your phone and everybody
has an iPhone pretty much at this point
especially also I'm no longer a support
customer but I'll explain that later um
but yeah I mean everybody has know this
print has iPhone so you have 18 T Sprint
and Verizon we all have this phone so
it's easy
they've come more common than when they
were with AT&amp;amp;T so when you have
something like this that stands out it
makes your phone more unique versus
there's another person with the iPhone
not oh oh do got the fly-ass iPhone with
the fly case you know so it's a sexual
part and I like things that are
different you know I like anything that
blings if it's shiny I love it um and
this is just something to add to my
personality in my case now for my
understanding they only have Mario at
this point but I will
I lie you say I haven't seen other cases
like this because I have seen other
cases like this with different
characters but the only thing I've seen
different that Lux addiction has
definitely done is that when you buy
cases like that I don't know how you
guys feel about the front part but I
like for my cases to have a back and a
front I can't stand to see somebody's
phone and they only have a bit like
that's tacky that's like put on one shoe
you need it needs to be a complete set
in a complete unison me and this has a
front and a back usually when I see and
there would be the same price which is a
$79.99 that this case cause they'll be
the same price but it only comes with
the back piece so it's just like okay
why would I just buy a bag and not a
front so that's the difference I've seen
I don't know personally you can email
them at Lux addiction dot-com they have
all the information there's twittered
the Facebook of their YouTube and as
well as their um their contact
information if you want to ask them
about this case or they'll begin any
other different characters I I've seen a
lot of different characters as far as
cases like this I would love to see like
a Smurfette case and they did give
Princess Peach from Mario Brothers I
definitely would want her because she's
just dope and actually see a case like
this in like all pink with the pink
dress and yellow hair would just be like
super dope so yeah I look out for that
cuz I'm sure it's coming I have a gut
feeling that it's coming but yeah
something like this is definitely
different I know people some people are
very um know in the norm when it comes
to phone cases I'm not most of the
people that I know I'm not for the last
let's see three Luck's addiction um
reviews I've done most of my subscribers
I've noticed have been very in the know
with what's going on and have been
they've expressed the same likes as I do
as far as phone cases jewelry and things
of that nature is concerned so
definitely um I love Mario I can't
honestly in my heart I can't say
anything negative all my ports work like
everything my SIM card slot although we
don't take some guards for this
particular phone all of my things at the
top every
just cut out so I can use you know a 42
pin connector my speaker everything
works
my camera is accessible my speaker is
this doesn't hurt when I'm on the phone
or anything of that nature my camera
it's like everything is good my flash
works like you would think his hat would
cut off but I'm assure you that that has
nothing to do with prostitutes in China
cuz he this is just illuminating as it
wants to be so it doesn't matter no
matter and my pictures come out like
seriously like fly so you know I don't
have those issues at all
so definitely Lux addiction is a good
company I'll have to say it I personally
I know there are other companies out
there that make cases um or whatever but
what I will say about people who ride
these cases what I will say is that you
cannot throw something like this in your
purse if you have a junky purse you
can't if you're a coming clumsy person I
wouldn't recommend it because these are
rhinestones that have been adhered to
this case these are not is not built
into the case this was put on the case
so you have to have some caution when
using something like this this is like a
piece of jewelry okay be careful because
you can't break it and you can f it up
okay so although that you do get these
extra gems in here when you start using
these up and you can have to take it
back to Michaels and buy some more and
that's just it's just like why are you
wasting your money at that point so be
careful if you know somebody who wants a
case like this and they're clumsy either
get it form a little jacket up or try to
find something else but for those who
are very dainty like myself and take
very good care of your things this would
be a great Christmas present a great
birthday present for anybody especially
big Mario Brothers fans cuz I love Mario
so I would love to any have other ones
too I've seen where they're just like
literally like sitting on the back of
the case and that's just too much
because I feel like I'm gonna break it
so this is just enough for me it's
enough protrusion I don't need a big
charm on the back of my phone so yeah
this is great
and thank you till X addiction for
sending me this case and I was
to you guys later I will put a video
link to the video of them actually with
the front with another case where you
can see how much it blings below or you
should see right here across the screen
so you see what I'm talking about as
well as all the details about the price
and if you have any questions just hit
me up down below peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
