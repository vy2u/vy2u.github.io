I'm gonna do a review on let's addiction
once again I'm gonna activate fans and
I'm gonna answer a lot of you guys
questions from the last video that I
didn't get around to and I'm also doing
a review on a new K so yeah let's get
started shall we
of course you guys know when you order
let's addiction and come in boxes like
this um whenever all this is a good
information uh but as you can se see it
says office
two down there so you guys can know that
they did send it to me um like Christmas
all right
so when you open the box is just a box
like this we went over there / - the
over those who didn't see we're going
over again um it comes in its bubble
wrap no no I know when it comes out a
bubble wrap I like - yeah um I don't
know what I did when I opened is to
close it bag I know it stays nude okay
without a word okay so anyway through
all of this bubble wrap
um okay okay and this what rep you get
some extra rhinestones just in case
something pops off like I said Java for
lady dollars and that they should be
popping up but if it says no no matter
um everything pretty much is my old case
I have um it came in here like this
like that and it came with each
individual like the back part in the
front part of the case came in each
individual things so just understand
when you order you in a rookie because
everything comes pretty much a quiz with
what it needs to in order for your case
to get to you nice steak and sound and
all any good stuff so this is the Cape
that I used to use um well it's not my
old iPod okay anybody want to buy I'm
just climbing um no I'm not going oh but
this is my old iPod Seymour asking me
like how to deliver anything pop off
everybody was expecting this whole
section to be gone no I haven't reglued
hot-glued reput on or anything any of
these items that are accompanied on
indicate everything is just how it was
when I first brought it so um for those
who were asking is it worth it I would
say it was worth it because I remember
getting the case done for my thing when
I it was one of I don't know what damn
phone I had but I remember getting the
case done for it and after about a week
something started to pop off and I can't
have him to do a kind of our
back-and-forth going back to these
people to get him you know this case
I've dropped non-contingent how many
times um sometimes it was accident other
times it was on purpose just to see the
durability of the case to make sure that
everything was what they said it was
gonna be in it thus far there's been
true I'm like all this stuff I expected
to pop off so quickly and nothing's came
off and I love that about these cases it
it is it's it's on him snows you know so
this is my older case for my second
generation iPod Touch you know this one
doesn't have a camera or anything like
that it's just an iPod that has internet
this is my new case this is the back of
it this is what I think is a sound
number and I forgot then just to
nineteen if I'm not mistaken but I'll
click the link in here um this case
doesn't exactly look like this on a site
I action to remove some things um down
here
it was a furry um you guys remember on
clueless how shares pins had like the
little furry things at the tips where
the ends
they hat like one right here was black
and then right here under the crown it
said clean I had them removed that
as well because I didn't want that
because um we're gonna probe re-boil on
here and I'll probably show you guys in
another video how I did it and all of
that good stuff and it's gold and black
too so um and this is the back of the
case sorry for the crappy quality of
this camera but I can't use my eye
because I'm using this as a display and
as you guys can see my camera right here
is still accessible just fine and my
speaker so that's not issue right here
in the front my front facing camera also
is accessible and they did an incredible
job
I've had this case for about two weeks
now if I mistake to two or three I think
it's too because I got it right after um
here's one about two weeks um so I'll
have to say if anything's this case is
quite it's good like I have no issues
with it at all nothing's popped off
nothing's broke nothing came off and you
know I'm pretty excited about it all my
port at the bottom are still accessible
so my volume rocker on the thigh still
work
I'm not keep my lock button at the top
still works and you know my home screen
that works too so I mean everything
works
you know I don't have no issues we're
trying to get to anything on or anything
like this now there is a difference
between months there's the first one in
second one the newer one since the iPod
is thinner then the taste of course will
be thinner now they could have just made
it funky just like this one you know so
you see there is a difference between
the two this one is way more robust in
the back then this one is it could be
because it has um this big thing on the
front but I doubt it that's why it is
it's just affected this I saw it heavier
then this one is and this one doesn't
move as well you got this one's
Universal news
um but yeah definitely um I love this
one more than I love this one even
though it's just sum up of any much
money I could but um you know it depends
on the iPod you know I mean I just like
this
a little bit better um but it's lighter
which I loves to it's much lighter in
that one one that one is like kind of a
paperweight mmm this one is not so much
you know and another thing that people
were asking me is do I think that is too
worth it yes I thought it's worth it
because this is a lot of labor that I
think people don't understand
you can bake I don't know what kind of
glue that they use for these cases I
couldn't tell you but this is a lot of
labor to get all of this done on a case
and have it stay on the case because I'm
sure if I brought you didn't you know if
you guys got any suggestions about glue
for those who want to do it there so go
ahead and post them at the bottom but I
just don't have the patience you know a
lot of us you don't have the patience we
don't have the time we don't have the
energy
sweet yeah I would lose my mind if I had
to sit down and do this you know but is
this your passion by all means go ahead
and do it um but yeah I love it I love
the color scheme it's very mean you know
this actually matches my bar boy
earrings and my necklace I'm already so
yeah this would look dope with
everything together which I should have
worked today but you know I just really
cut them with new moons well I like that
done um but otherwise I have no
complaint if you guys have any more
questions please let me know and I'll
answer them below in this case retails
for $79.99 on Lux addiction and calm and
I think this is thou the top of the
style entitled so you guys are know
exactly what it is and I think that's
about it um if you guys have any more
questions please feel free to contact me
about it um as well as lux addiction
peace guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
