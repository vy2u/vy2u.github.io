so I'm doing a review today for a
little-known company that you guys know
that work with before called Alexis
addiction calm and you guys know I've
been working with Lex addiction for
years I think since my last channel I
started working with them so it's been
about two and a half I was probably
three years now since I've been working
with them which is cool because um they
hit me up recently an excavator to
review on you know any case today
they've restocked and have nucleic cases
and stuff he's the last time I did
review I think it's gonna been about a
year since my last one um so yeah um the
case i'm gonna review today is my new
glittery beautiful coca cola case um I
don't have the five iphone 5 yet I have
the five I mean the 4s um and please
excuse my crack that screen but y'all
know y'all follow me on Instagram gal
was there that day it happened um but
anyway um the reason why I wanted to do
and decided to do another review because
a lot of people still ask me about the
cases that I've had in the past like
this case for my ipod um I have another
one for iphone the Mario one I still
have and these cases ice to interchange
them and still use them a lot like these
are not something that I reviewing to
never use the product like you guys see
them in pictures when I take me tricks
like selfies and stuff in the mirror you
guys see that I use these cases all the
time so of course you know what Lux
addiction I think I'll get to the price
in just a second but they they always
ship when I ship them to me the shipping
with my name on them they put all my
information you know any from they
come in this this nice cardboard box
because it ensures that your um your
case won't be crushed and smash when you
get it um it comes the actual case comes
in these plastic covers when you get
them this one has I don't know if
everybody's name is on there is but
Minds was put on mines i think it was
for review purposes um so they cup each
piece comes in one of these then
actually comes in this drawstring
and then it's wrapped in this bubble
wrap and then in this box so when you
get your stuff is not gonna be smashed
it's not going to be squish if it is
broken that means that you have a very
tacky post office that's the only reason
I can think that your case would be any
type of damage um you know when you get
any lucks addiction product they always
enjoy a business card that has a phone
number or email address other twitter
facebook youtube gmail um and then in
each case comes with extra gems now i
have to say this as long as I've had
these cases my rhinestones high popped
off but I've had this one for about a
week and a half and nothing is popped
off just yet um place I've never had to
go over using these amount for the like
and I've used these cases for like a
year straight and never had to use all
the gems that they give you you know
like naturally this is not a natural
thing so something is going to pop off
eventually but it's not like you're not
going the whole coca-cola it's not going
to be missing like I've seen cases where
you have them for a while and then
everything is missing but so far so good
um the thing different about this case
versus my other one is that this this
case seems to fit the phone much easier
and much smoother than my Mario case did
this one seem like it's really tight or
tailored to either tailored for my phone
the other one felt like that too but
this one really feels like it's like a
glove like all of the ports and
everything on this I like everything is
just perfect like it fits so perfect for
the phone the only thing that I have
noticed i went to put my charger in here
and maybe because of the simple fact
that the new iphone chargers are the
little Thunderbolt chargers but this
does split and move just a little when
out because you know the charger port
has a little pocket so it doesn't just a
little I mean it don't open the case or
anything it just moves it a little bit
um and then I've noticed something that
they have changes that as you can see
right here at the top the arm you
probably can't see
but there's other ways to deal way for
you you can put a charm on here if you
want to do if you a charm person and you
like charms then this actually would be
perfect for you um I would have I think
you can get you can get these everything
is handmade so you can get these as
custom I was going to suggest and ask
them cuz they do this in pink for me but
since i have everything that's so damn
pink already I'm not od'd on pink but I
do just want something regular and
normal you know kind of more neutral not
so Barbie ish you know just to have as
an option and I I mean I plan on having
this phone not that much longer anyway
so you know it's cool i might actually
get this for whatever iphone i get next
you know I'm i know i'm not getting the
galaxy so please don't suggest in the
comments below you get I don't want that
phone it's too big it's like it's like
having an iPad again sure it's not me so
um yeah I love this case I don't have
anything bad to say about it nothing is
fell off and as you can see by this case
that I've had for like besides a cup
like this right here I snatched ease off
because a few I came off but all of this
stuff that was on the back of this case
in I reviewed this case like two years
ago still kicking spain case still
kicking so I love the fact that looks
addictions products they do last the
retail price for this particular funny
thing is i mean this case is seventy
nine dollars and personally is what
worth it because um I did purchase a
case from them on my own accord with my
own money um and I had it for this phone
it was just a regular I think was a
Louboutin case it was like all sparkly
though um and I loved it you know I
still have it i don't know where it is
at the moment but i still have it um and
even being it up like i could just
imagine purchasing with their own money
i would suggest this product not because
you know some people review things and
they'll say all good things about it but
I have nothing bad personally to say
about the product because it actually is
it's a great a product so I'm going to
put it on and put a video after this of
it actually in the Sun like I always do
to show you how did how it looks you
know when it's done when it's
again and all of that good stuff so I
hope you guys enjoyed this review if you
have any questions let me know like how
long does it last you know like I said
nothing's popped off yet and I will give
an update in a future video not probably
a dedicated video but just you know
random like it's what it's like now um
but yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this
and I hope you guys have a beautiful day
make sure you guys you guys hit up Lux
addiction which is lux addiction calm
and it is so hot in LA right now talk to
ya later bye yeah i love the case I
can't I've never had a problem with Lux
addiction at all their products are
always great for me I'm personally
speaking I've never had any issues
please excuse my screen I promise I'm
getting new phone soon um but yeah I
love the case to death no problem so far
and I will do it update soon to let you
guys know I was old enough</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
