so deep it's ill pacify the stem chief
okay low as a truck the tables all
starving alright guys so this hair is
from a company called bucks weave and I
think they do come the same thing that
the Aliexpress companies do a name like
like sell the hair it kind of comes in a
like a piece they call each bundle is a
piece so this is a four piece 28 inches
of 6:13 blonde and then they also send
me a frontal which is another frontal
that I'm currently wearing it's a
different frontal which was this frontal
and it's a sub-base frontal which here
it goes ear to ear so this will be just
the still base I was under the
impression that it was going to be so
base from ear to from here to here but
this part is just lace and then this is
the silk top part the frontal itself is
24 inches which is really long compared
to my hair
this is as long as it is now the reason
why I did not use this front so that
they send me a verse is the one that I
have in it's because this one did not
come with black roots it is Barbie
blonde from the roots up and I didn't
want that just as a diamond piece look I
wanted it to look a little bit natural
in the front and you guys know I don't
have a really big forehead so when you
are not a person with a lot of forehead
space um gluing or taping this down to
your forehead and make sure forehead
look this small so I didn't want that so
I opted to just use this one that I've
received from closure store that as you
can see it blends seamlessly and it's
the same exact blonde as this one is
just had already had dark roots already
in it which means it was less work for
me to do however this I will use this
frontal for something else I'm thinking
doing like some really long wavy pink
hair and this actually will be great and
I could actually do probably just like a
half an inch of actual dark roof and
then let the rest be very wild and pink
and big so these definitely double for
other stuff to always keep on frontals
and my closures that I do not use it is
sent to me from the company as far as my
length goes everything is 28 except for
the closure core I mean if we look for
the frontal of course but this is as
long as it is here and this is as long
as it is in the back so it's actually um
just a little bit larger of course than
my 24 inches 28 inches but it feels like
a 30 like I didn't measure it to see if
it was really 28 so I'm gonna just
assume what they saying is the truth but
it definitely feels more like a 30 than
it does um between 8 so far so good I do
like it
you guys know how our front tools work
if you don't I'm going to explain it um
plus I explained it in my video about
closures and stuff like that as well but
so how frontal works is this this part
is the whole entire front piece of my
hair so this will be from ear to ear and
then it would stop here in the back so
we'll stop right here so all of this and
then from here to here is my front so
then once you get to the back part of
this you start putting all your tracks
back here so all of our tracks are just
in the back none of them are in the
front are on the sides so it creates a
lot less bulk when you put your leave in
or you make your wigs which that's one
of the reasons why I really love frontal
they're much more versatile than
vultures I love closures to it just kind
of depends on what I'm doing so if I
wanted to put this is going to look
crazy but fine if I wanted to put a bun
at the job here and I wanted to put like
a bun right here and then leave the back
down I definitely could if I wanted to
um but that's the look that I was going
for because I actually want to do that
look with some curly hair or some wavy
here I don't really want to do
TRAI now to my actual bundles my bundles
were um I I will not lie I had a bit of
a gripe with the bundles when I was
putting them in you guys know how when
you get to the end I don't know how
y'all so y'all wigs and your weaves and
stuff together but usually when I get to
the end
I usually loop and pull through out the
entire weft and when I get to the end I
put it through the web and through the
cab so it can secure and it won't fall
apart I noticed a lot of fraying at the
end of the actual weft as I was putting
it through I noticed that it was kind of
like the stitching was kind of coming
apart which then leads to a lot of
shedding when you do put your we start
to brush and we're now I did not steal
my left foot hairs a strand um let's see
what happens when I do do this see like
here's a strand see and then this is
going to continue to happen unless I
take this apart and I put some of
sealant on my lips which is a lot and
sealant again is another extra step on
top of making a way that you don't want
to have to do because it didn't turns
out to be a lot of work and any kind of
gets a bit expensive now you guys know I
did find my color which is the 613 color
which tends to make me look too much
darker on camera because my hair is so
light but I did do a review for a wig
that was this color down in the same
tone recently which was kind of like my
mosquito Barbie look that was this week
so I think this week is the salmon same
length is this nothing this is like 30
um but it's the same premise and
everything except this is just a full
wig this is not you know any tracks in
it and it's really full but if I wanted
to I could take some webs out of this
wig and then put it in this to make it
super full if that's what I was going
for but yeah I mean this color works
very well
my skin tongue so that's why I'm pretty
much sticking to that with the darker
roots but I do like how these roots are
opposed to these these are a little bit
longer these are just literally like
right here which I do like more so then
the longer ones but it doesn't bother me
much for this but this is a nice
laid-back look because I do have so many
wigs in this or waste or weave in this
particular 6:13 color I'm getting kind
of bored with it so I do think I'm gonna
color this hair pink just because I want
something different or aqua or something
of that nature um because I'm getting
kind of bored with just the regular 6:13
I love the color don't get me wrong but
how many wigs can I have in this shade
you know especially if it's not as
middle part which I've done before or a
side part which I've done before with a
wig not a weave you get it it's a bit of
a difference so it just really depends
on how I'm feeling in and since it's
that I already have something very
similar I'm definitely going to color
this um maybe a red already had a red
here so I don't really want to go Kevin
show wholaver it again but I don't know
I gotta find something maybe blue maybe
like a light till ish blue eye like in
Keyshia Cole hair with blue it was
really pretty until she curled it so
again I have in for 20 the picture that
they send me have five bundles of
28-inch and I started putting my hair in
and then I realized either I misplaced a
bundle that I looked for for two days or
they only send me forward so only having
four and then my frontal is 2412
actually is 16 inches or north 20 this
one is 20 the one a semi was 24 inches
but that of course had no dark roots and
then the one that they send me the
frontal that they send me was a 13 by 4
frontal and it was a 4 by 4 silk top so
pretty much is all of this and then in
the middle of it it was just um it was
just a silk top part and on that one my
lace color was transparent so it wasn't
Brown
and that's I mean clearly you don't want
a brown cap up and they have light hair
because then it just starts to look a
little crazy so you have to get
transparent lace but transparent lace
starts to look very Barbie doll ish when
you put it in if you don't have any
color on it if it just stays this normal
color with no dark roots so like this
particular one has brown because this
part is brown so yeah it's if you don't
get it I understand but I will say
whoever colored this hair did a really
good job
although the 613 that I've had have been
pretty soft but this was this felt like
some really nice straight out the donors
headed virgin hair that had not been
tampered with
so whoever their color and start over
there they should definitely keep them
because they did a wonderful job with
keeping this really silky and really
soft because when you get blonde hair
sometimes it be real crunchy like
extremely crunchy and it's not
attractive and it's not cute and then
when you try to curl it or put anything
to it
I'm never going to curl this before I
color it because I never have no
credible on here my blonde hair has
always been straight so I'm a curl this
it may be like a deep side part in some
waves and then see how I really like it
and then I'll put the color on I'm
running a sale right now we're all four
of these bubbles plus the frontal is 299
so if I was y'all and you was looking
for some really long stripper mermaid
hair to color I would take full
advantage of this because that's kind of
unheard of usually for $2.99
you're gonna get two bundles and that
does not include a frontal so yeah I
follow John I would definitely take
advantage of it make sure you guys check
the links below and I hope you guys
enjoyed this if you have any questions
make sure you put them below and I will
come back with a curled hair video um
it's not gonna be really curled it's
probably gonna be like wavy maybe um but
I'll come back and let y'all know before
I actually put some color on it but it's
probably gonna be like a very mosquito
pink</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
