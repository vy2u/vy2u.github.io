hey I got my down super right I got
loose screws and branches like I said
pull she better be good tonight alright
guys so today I'm going to talk about my
way that I'm working um and I know you
guys noticing like your hair look real
short because it is um I'm actually
rocking my luck sleeve extensions and on
the back they have I think these are the
different types brazilian hair peruvian
hair Malaysian hair Mongolian here
Indian hair rushing here European here
in here not virgin hair recommended so
they tell you what is the difference in
the type hair type which I thought was
very interesting you guys would actually
want to know about this situation so it
tells you like which one is cheap like
Indian hair is considered cheap and then
they have all of the rest and then all
of my bundles came in this drawer that
was really nice and this is the paper
with all of the information for my
current install so this is their
Brazilian hair for peace um it has a
frontal and it has four bundles so yes
right now I have a frontal and I have
four bundles in and I will say that this
is very very nice hair um but I'm sure
you guys are noticing like this part
right here which I'm not understanding
why it keeps doing is I put spray on it
and everything and it just doesn't want
to lay right it's just giving me these
little prickly things that I don't quite
understand but hey it's what it is these
are the two pieces that I do have left
as you can probably tell they are a
natural Brown well I'm getting like a
very natural brown color these
extensions are supposed to be 100% on
virgin hair so therefore you guys know
virgin again I said it's all the time
virgin hair is 100% virgin there is no
extra was not supposed to be any extra
anything so mean
in here would be um a very light brown
or a very natural brown and from what
I'm seeing you probably can't tell on
camera because it just looks regular
black but it actually is brown there are
quite a few gray hairs so that's pretty
much what if that's the fillers that
this hair would have you can't really
tell what it's installed but it has a
nice amount of gray hairs in it which
really doesn't bother me because once
the hair is actually in Sarge you really
can't tell but if you color it you
really won't be able to tell at all so
it's that but there's a lot of beards on
this hair as you can see maybe you can
but there's a nice amount of beards that
go and for those who are watching this
for the first time or don't know what a
beer is on a leave a beard is the top
part of the track where the hair is that
is pretty much short and usually for
poor people who do not wear closures
like Malika and Khadijah um from dash
dolls I think they just do their own
closures when you take two pieces of
hair and you sew them down
like such like this and then you try to
press the hair down what happens is
these little pieces all stick up like
that and that's not attractive and it
takes a lot of product to get the hair
down meaning the hair will not flow any
more naturally like you wanted it to so
I do that I will say we're going to
start off with those cons those are the
things that I didn't like about this
hair um I didn't put these particular
tracks in for that particular reason to
show you guys the example um other than
that I haven't received much shedding if
any at all when it came down to these
they were very easy to comb they were
very easy to install and these curls
that I have have been in here for
forever so they do actually hold a curl
I did not however cut the bottom portion
of this I only cut the bang piece in the
front all of this is how it came to mean
frontal is 16 and I believe that all my
bundles are 16 as well you guys know I
do not wear short hair but I'm looking
out from our short hair sisters but
y'all who just do not like to wear you
know
the stripper hood hair that I'm so into
when I have affinity for um yeah you
guys can definitely get with this and
for the price of this I think that it's
very very very comparable to higher and
hair now I've only had this hair for
about I want to say almost a month so I
haven't had it for a long period of time
so I really couldn't tell you how this
will hold up in six months however um
for the time that I have been learning
because um the weather here has been
kind of on and off this is kind of been
on one of my new go tools because it is
short but it still gives me a spot I
just hate when it's so short that it
don't look like nothing you know at
least I know for a fact I can get like a
little bang and a little layer put up in
here and then you know I feel like I'm
not so ball headed you know and then I
have on my little top might will like a
dress is a dress shirt from Quebec mafia
Thank You cupcake mafia for all the
words and bags and um yeah I thought
that this bandana will go perfect with
this cuz um I'm coming
trying to accessorize a little bit more
because usually when I'm dressed
everything has a specific way you have
to wear it so I was just like okay but
um yeah four bubbles of this um I like
it
I enjoyed this I think I'm gonna do more
of this because it was easy you know the
only thing I will say is the thing about
short hair that I don't like is the
install because you guys know the
install the bundles be so long and
trying to get all this hair on this cap
was very difficult that's why when
people say all you have like 34 inches
and you have eight bundles and it's like
it's equivalent to having 5/16 inch
bundles you know like that so it was
just much longer and I was doubling and
doubling and doubling so this hair is
very very very full like super duper
full as you can see you can't even see
my face about do this it's that much
hair and then I still have those pieces
left and I think I had another piece
somewhere else who knows um but yeah
looks weave there I like them I like
them and their package their package
presentation is very nice too
this actually came with like a bow that
said looks weave on it and it was closed
as well as they gave me some eyelashes
that I'm currently rocking right now and
I think they're they're mink lashes if
I'm not mistaken so these are very like
the ones that I'm used to wearing this
is what these are but yeah I'm if you
guys are interested in this hair that
I'm rocking again this is a lace frontal
meet Brazilian on with four bundles of
the same here which is main Brazilian in
16 inches so everything is 16 I'll put
the links for this below and I will
catch you all in the next one and if you
guys want me to do more short hair like
this or comparable to this okay now let
me just say this before y'all get
devotin it in comments and I am NOT
doing nothing shorter than a 16 so
please don't ask for me to do 10 inches
or 14 inches because it's not going to
happen okay just saying but if you want
me to do like 18 or you know let me know
and I'm starting to think that maybe I
should do like a tutorial like how to
let your hair with like pact hair since
y'all people keep asking about that
let that be something you're interested
in let me know so I'll put the info
below and I'll talk to y'all later peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
