short review because I don't really have
that many lashes left so you guys know I
had did a review for a company called
Lux realize well I thought it was luxury
lash but it's luxury look look three
lash um and they sent me two things of
lashes to try out from pretty much the
entire line of mink lashes so I'll tell
you my personal experience and I'm
currently wearing the all Naturals okay
so um after my last review he asked me
what was my favorite out of all of them
and pretty much I told him that I really
loved the crisp the double crisscross
the murmur my favorites because they
look so great and I wore them you've
already seen an intro and then I wore
them here so I just wanted something
similar to that or you could use in a
whole bunch of those now where the
lashes probably like a good six or seven
times before actually some way so I'll
show you the ones I have left because as
you leave were filled with lashes and
you see I got about three left so the
double ones are these which they're very
similar to the all Naturals that I'm
currently wearing and it's these and
I've worn these or when I'm just having
like a day where I want to look like I
have on makeup but no really
I'll put these on these are called
secret and the secret ones are less
dense but they're longer and these
really work when you want a little bit
of something like you don't want to look
all extra ball I'd it but if you just
want like a little bit of dramatic nice
but you don't want to be like me
so yeah and then the last pair that I
still have left are called city girl
and they are these kind of like wispy
ones now a lot of these lashes a lot of
these lashes that I do have I have
doubled a lot of them up just for more
dramatic nice because when you're on
camera like right
I literally have like I have just a pair
on I don't I was gonna do double pairs
but I didn't but a lot of times when I
do use them I will double them up just
because it gives you more of a dramatic
look you can see them better you have
whole bunch of my scarier and it's just
great and since I've gotten them gotten
those lashes I have literally wore
nothing else but those so the video I do
with my sister was my makeup we
used I think like all natural and like
another I forgot they're listed below in
that video um exactly which ones we use
but we doubled those when I did the
Steve Aoki video I use those when I've
done pretty much every video for a video
a day in May I had those lashes on
unless I don't have no lashes on it um
but they're very good they actually have
you guys know how you buy lashes in like
the rim part where you put the glue
sometimes I find that it doesn't it's
not stiff enough to stay on but it also
it's not soft where it's just gonna
crumble up which I hate but literally
some of my favorite lashes but I will
say my crisscross ones are by just my
favorite one the crisscross fluff is
what they're called I love those I've
wore those here as you can see and I
just is something about I guess the
section of them that I love when I did
the Versace video with the long hair and
I did the my house my rules my pleasure
I had those on one and I had on some
individual bottom lashes too which is
very hard to see in a video but in
person you could do I look like a big
dog but I used in that video I
definitely used two sets of those so
that's my eye
pretty much you can see any of my eye
shadow I had on that many lashes but
they actually last I washed them you
know cuz sometimes you want to rewear
them but you don't want to just take
them off take the glue off in ringworm
sometimes I just like to wash them then
let them dry and then reuse them they
not gonna be as stiff and brand new
that's how you when you're talking my
package but they did last mean each pair
about this
2-8 uses and then at that particular
point I was like okay I'm gonna let it
go one pair I had um I had since the
first time he sent it ain't still poppin
so we gonna see how long if they run but
are you're looking for some very
affordable yet nice lashes I definitely
would check them out and they have a
plethora of lashes that you could choose
from from very natural all the way into
the dramatics I'm not really one because
I am a dude I'm not really one for crazy
dramatic lashes because then I start to
Teeter on dry clean and that's not what
I'm trying to do but if I just want like
these just to show that I have something
on with my makeup it definitely helps
so check out luxury luxury lashes the
link will be below and if you guys have
any questions or if you're wondering
about any past videos and one or what
specific lash but I mean name I had just
put it below and then I'll tell you
exactly which one it has because I have
all of those saved about which ones I
wore that particular day so yeah I hope
you guys enjoyed this and I'll get you
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
