oh ok guys so I'm gonna do something
again a little bit different which i'm
going to review some lashes now you guys
know I love a good lash it's all about
power of lash right so I'm actually
going to review for this company called
luxuria ok so obviously this company is
not called luxury lash I don't know
exactly how you would say this I don't
know if they misspelled it or what but I
glanced at it and I just assumed this it
looks real ash until I want to go spell
it so yeah a lash and um well I guess I
could do this looks real I look at those
hop in all of these ok so the company
contacted me and asked me to do review
and I said we love your lashes and we
love you know the makeup looks like she
do endure that I would you like to
review some lashes and I'm like yeah and
he said the lashes that you want so what
they did was a semi I think two of each
lash that I picked an I think I pick
three different styles so we're going to
get to the current style that I'm
wearing which I love and just to let you
guys know these are soft fiber mink
lashes I love living glish so these came
in a well actually they came in a
container like such and then they came
in this too and then the lashes
workforce in here and in the inside it
says apply luxury lodges with five easy
steps measure your lashes and trim if
necessary apply mascara to your natural
lashes apply glue applied the last
year's finish the touch and after the
glue has dried put the last on your
eyeline to cover any gaps with the kalu
so these are very barbash as you can see
are you close the very Bobby like I love
these and the
these are the ones these are called
shine me and this is the first time I'm
wearing these guys I actually have been
wearing my sister suggested that I get
the grand glamour ones from another
company which I do like and those are
very viable and I like the rubble of
whom but I seem to like these a little
bit better because they do give me
fullness but I noticed that some lashes
that I do where they made me look really
sleepy like I'm a trainer I love trina
no shape but you get what I'm saying so
shiny looks like not on my face they
come in like these and again these are
some mink lashes they vary in price
depending on the type of lash that you
get because they have like kind of like
the standard the middle grade and then
the top great lashes so it really just
depends on what you into okay so these
are a little bit different these are the
all mink lashes um these that i have on
our soft fiber lashes these are the
actual mink lashes these are when I true
% handcrafted mink lashes these ones are
called fluff cross first fluff
crisscross and they go to worry they
look like this and as you can see they
have this very nice pretty crest cross
and they're really long which I like you
know I love a good dramatic lash I don't
give a damn if I want to the corner
store McDonald's or I'm going to a ball
i'm still gonna wear some very dramatic
lashes my eyes are very small so i
noticed that if i wear bigger lashes
they make my eyes look a little bit
bigger and and also depending on how to
do my makeup so these are called pink
girl and these are also one hundred
percent mink and this is what these look
like and these are like a little more
sparse so they're going to give you that
I would wear these if I was wearing some
bone straight black hair I like to match
my lashes with my hair when it comes to
like certain styles like right now I'm
going for kind of a hip-hop
me look so my lashes go with it you know
but if I was doing something a little
more sophisticated or I was doing
something like towards the nighttime a
little bit more I definitely would wear
these because these are gorgeous and I
love a lie that has a point on it I hate
blushes when I see girls I'd be like she
did that because for me that would not
have worked how would get ready with me
video coming up and I actually use these
lashes in that video so you will see
more of these i'm going to show you guys
a glass here that i received which I
believe are the same this is this one is
actually called doll face did y'all do
this just for me hmm y'all night um but
it says doll face on the bag so maybe
they just put my name on it and it says
one hundred percent handcrafted mink fur
lashes and then these are kind of like a
shorter alternative they like a little
more they kind of remind me of my our
deal that's just a little bit um the
natural wispies that's what these kind
of Romania but I'm filling him I'm
definitely especially this pair y'all
like I'm really really my makeup been on
for a minute so I'm gonna get too close
but I really do like these like they are
long and their dramatic as hell but they
work you know they work I wish facetune
work for this or else up because if it
did not be all up in your face but um
yeah I like these a lot and they're very
lightweight they don't feel very heavy i
use my duo glue to apply them um I you
can also use hair glue if that works
better for you I know a lot of people
would prefer that over duo again luxury
lash if you guys are interested in some
lashes again they ran from range from I
think like nine dollars although it's
like 35 dollars it just depends on what
type of blast you're looking for so um
make sure you guys is visit them and I
don't get y'all in my next one let me
know how you guys when you got your
lashes what look did you do with them
okay I'll catch all in my next one
