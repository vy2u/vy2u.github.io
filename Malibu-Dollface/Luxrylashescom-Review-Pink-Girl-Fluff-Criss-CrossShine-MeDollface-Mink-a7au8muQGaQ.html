oh okay guys so I'm gonna do something
again a little bit different which I'm
gonna review some lashes now you guys
know I love a good lash it's all about
power lash right so I'm actually gonna
review for this company called Luxuria
okay so obviously this company is not
called luxury lash I don't know exactly
how you would say this I don't know if
they misspelled it or what but a glance
at it and I just assumed they sell
luxury lash until I went to go spell it
so yeah a lash and well I guess I could
do this look at those these okay so the
company contacted me and asked me to do
review and I said we love your lashes
and we love you know the makeup looks
like you do in there that I would you
like to review some lashes and I'm like
yeah and he said the lashes that she
wants so what they did was a semi I
think two of each lash that I picked and
I think I picked three different styles
so we're gonna get to the current style
that I'm wearing which I love and just
to let you guys know these are soft
fiber mink lashes I love a living flesh
so these came in a were actually they
came in a container like such and then
they came in this too and then the
lashes work force in here and in the
inside it says apply luxury lodges with
five easy steps measure your lashes and
trim if necessary apply mascara to your
natural lashes applying glue apply the
lashes finish the touch and after the
glue has dried put the last on your I
lied to cover any gaps with the coup so
these are very barbash as you can see
I'll get close they're very bobby like I
love these and
these are the ones these are called
shiny and this is the first time I'm
wearing these guys I actually have been
wearing my sister suggested that I get
the grand glamour ones from another
company which I do like and those are
very viable and I like the rubber boom
but I seem to like these a little bit
better because they do give me fullness
but I noticed that some lashes that I do
where they make me look really sleepy
like I'm a Trina I love Trina no shade
but you get what I'm saying
so Xiaomi looks like not on my face they
come in like these and again these are
some I mean clashes they vary in price
depending on the type of lash that you
get because they have like kind of like
the standard the middle grade and then
the top grade lashes so it really just
depends on what you into okay so these
are a little bit different these are the
all mink lashes
um these that I have one are soft fiber
lashes these are the actual mink lashes
these are 100% handcrafted mink lashes
these ones are called fluff cross fuss
fluff criss cross and they they look
like this and as you can see they have
this very nice pretty crest cross and
they're really long which I like you
know I love a good dramatic lash I don't
give a damn if I'm going to the corner
store McDonald's or I'm going to a ball
I'm still gonna wear some very dramatic
lashes my eyes are very small so I
noticed that if I wear bigger lashes
they make my eyes look a little bit
bigger and and also depending on how I
do my makeup so these are called pink
girl and these are also 100% mink and
this is what these look like and these
are like a little more sparse so they're
gonna give you that I would wear these
if I was wearing some bone straight
black hair I like to match my lashes
with my hair when it comes to like
certain styles like right now I'm going
for kind of a hip-hop
look so my lashes go with it you know
but if I was doing something a little
more sophisticated or I was doing
something like towards the night time a
little bit more I definitely would wear
these because these are gorgeous and I
love a lash that has a point on it I
hate blunt lashes when I see girls I'd
be like she did that because for me that
would not have worked I would get ready
with me video coming up and I actually
use these lashes in that video so you
will see more of these I'm going to show
you guys these last pair that I receive
which I believe are the same this is
this one is actually called Dollface the
job dude is just for me hmm yah night um
but it says Dollface on the back so
maybe they just put my name on it and it
says 100% handcrafted mink fur lashes
and then these are kind of like a
shorter alternative they like a little
more they kind of remind me of my ardell
lashes just a little bit um the natural
whispies that's what these kind of
remind me of but I'm filling them I'm
definitely especially this pair y'all
like I'm really really one makeup it on
for a minute so I'm gonna get too close
but I really do like these like they are
long and they're dramatic as hell but
they work you know they work I wish
facetune work for this or as if it
didn't up you all up in your face but um
yeah I like these a lot and they're very
lightweight they don't feel very heavy i
use my duo glue to apply them um you can
also use hair glue if that works better
for you I know a lot of people would
prefer that over duo again luxury lash
if you guys are interested in some
lashes again they ran from range from I
think like nine dollars although it's
like 35 dollars it just depends on what
type of lash you're looking for so um
make sure you guys is visit them and
okay chocolate my next one let me know
how you guys when you got your lashes
what look did you do with them
okay I'll catch y'all in my next wedding
