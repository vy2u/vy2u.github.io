out a lot of videos today because I'm
kind of backed up on my reviews for hair
I've been holding for way too long so
yeah
this wig is a very beautiful unit and it
is from a looks weave yes you guys gonna
see yeah um you guys know I've worked
with look sweet before I don't believe I
ever reviewed a week for them I think
I've only did wet the hair with them and
I have to say so far so good
but this unit has its hang up as they
all do so we're gonna get to that in
just a second but first let's get to the
specs of this puppy show the length of
this is 26 inches which I didn't measure
this time it is actually 26 inches the
color is a 1b so it's a off black my cap
size is a small my cap construction is a
glueless lace front cap and this means
that again it's only this much of lace
and the back is actually tracks there
are no it's not full lace all the way
from the front to the back
it is 100% indian remy hair it has no
snow top and my lace color is a light
brown so before we go any further I want
to show you what this hair was based off
of and then we'll get into what I have
so it was supposed to look like this
picture of Miss keke palmer who's
currently my favorite as a zayday
williams on scream queens and this is
the hair that i have no i will say this
the curl pattern is deadly the problem
with this week versus what she has is a
portion weave but the heard the top of
her hair here has a lot of density in it
and this week does not it's very flat at
the root and it it's great for this look
but it's not very great for that look
because that means I will have to Wan
curl or find some curlers that are round
in size to try to make it match this
hair texture so it could look the same
so I just pretty much tried to flip over
method shut up IV and do something a
little bit different because I just
didn't want to have to put heat in this
and I didn't want to because the hair is
very nice and it is very soft um
because there are tracks in the back I
can't really get away with stuff I would
normally do such as it's kind of like
the half-up half-down that does not work
with this because you'll be able to see
the tracks in the back no matter how you
try to disguise them they're noticeable
so don't try it if you know you can see
the tracks just let it go it's not the
style for this particular way and I will
say that the hair at the bottom I have
not did anything to this hair since I
received it but the hair at the bottom
that these really tight curls they
tangle they tangle like crazy and I
don't really I think it's because
they're they are so tight so running my
fingers through like this it's not an
issue but then what happens is because
they are so tight you get this shedding
this shoe and I don't know if I can
really tell but it's quite a bit hair
that I just pulled out so this is kind
of the issue that I'm I'm kind of
running into with this because it's
because it's so dense at the bottom they
curled it so tight of course to last and
I wouldn't need to really run my fingers
through this or her I mean you know run
my fingers through it or trying to
disturb the curls if the route was the
same as this that means I could've wore
it as one and I didn't have to do it I
can't wear it super super super duper
tight prom curls at the bottom and then
have relaxed hair at the top it just
looks kind of weird but this kind of has
more like a natural wave look to it so
I'll give you guys a close-up on the
hair itself and it's beautiful it's
nothing wrong with the hair at all the
only issue that I have is the fact that
it didn't really mimic the picture much
of what it was supposed to be I haven't
Co washed this particular hair as of yet
but I'm sure when our coop sheet is
gonna relax so much more but this is
it's a very nice unit and it's very soft
and as you guys can see I've been
fiddling with it most of this video
because it is so sloppy just wants to
kind of lay and give you this nice
mix by but just tell me what you guys
think I like it just not crazy about it
and that's because of the way it was
curled and this is gonna be founded like
the natural crow pattern that it is I'm
sure so then it's gonna kind of look
weird you know see how tight this is
compared to this this is the only thing
that kind of bugs me about this because
it wasn't all one but hey somebody I'm
sure is loving this right now so yeah
let me know what you think below and
make sure you guys check out the link
for this again is from lux we've exact
him and I will catch you guys in my next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
