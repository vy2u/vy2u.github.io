haul yeah I never do these so I'm gonna
do a quick haul on the makeup that I use
on a regular and makeup that I buy a lot
of times when I post pictures on
Instagram you guys know I'm not a
professional makeup artist by a longshot
if you guys watch my channel you guys
see me evolved from trying to how to do
makeup to doing the same look all the
time this is the only one I know how to
do so that's why I don't really post
many tutorials because I mean there's so
many on YouTube from people who actually
know what they're doing so for me to do
it it's gonna be kind of pointless but
I'll tell you guys the things that I use
on a regular basis and my face looks a
little bit different than it usually
does and I'm gonna tell you why
because recently I went to Mac and I
went to go ahead after I did the review
for the pro longwear foundation because
I've been wearing my Kat Von D
foundation well I was wearing it but it
was a little too orange like it was too
warm and it was making me look very
Orange II so if you look back on like
January when I did my meet-and-greet my
makeup was very like very very like a
red which I didn't really like I like
the coverage but I didn't like the color
so I didn't go back and renew change it
and get a different color so I went back
to my mom stick my second-to-none
Foundation which is in clay - and I wear
that I've been wearing that for years
but because it doesn't have it's not a
full coverage foundation I wanted to try
something different
plus I like having these stuff that one
just might have been just the wrong
color and I need to go down probably one
more color I'm not really sure yet but I
went to Mac um to get some of that and
they didn't have it but I mean she gave
me the paper in here to let me know
which one it would be which would be the
pro longwear waterproof NW 40 that would
seem to be like very good for my color
so I'm gonna go back and get that ages
and have I was at the Hollywood and
Highland MAC store so she said they
didn't have any more in that color but
when I was there though I got this which
is the dark golden mineralized
skinfinish y'all if y'all own this the
mine is in your dark golden get it in
your color this is a great finish for
your makeup I will not steer you wrong
it has a beautiful like glow
to it like I'll put something right now
because I'm feeling a little on the a
little bit on
$35 which I don't think it's bad at all
because you know everything else had
Matt cost as a million dollars so this
is actually very very very very good and
it's my new is one of my new favorites I
will say for sure because it's really
hard for me to find things that I like
makeup wise I'll start something now
this is cool
and then I wearing it but this arlynn
this is going in by holy grails for sure
the next thing that you guys have asked
me about as far as my makeup is
concerned as you guys asked me what do I
highlight and contour with so I
highlight in contour with these two bad
boys which is the honest eyes I mean if
you ain't heard of these then you might
as well just go climb up under a rock
but you guys know the Anastasia Beverly
Hills kids a contour kids the first one
that I had received was this one which
is the regular one it's the powder one
and this one is in medium so if you as
you can tell I have definitely been
using it um and this was kind of how I
learned how to highlight and contour my
face I kind of had an idea but this
really helped because I had more options
and I'd have to buy like seven different
things to do one thing um but recently
she released the cream contour kit and I
have this one and I think yes medium as
well and this really like these colors
really really really really really work
yes so um I would definitely suggest
these so what I do is I use this to do
my contour and highlight and then I use
this one to set it so there you go so
that was my intention when buying it
because I like how powder foundation I
mean powder contour looks but the cream
looks way better and you can get a
better blend with cream the next thing
that you guys were asking me about was
what primer do I use because they're
like you never look greasy in your
videos which is a damn lie but I'm gonna
let y'all believe it's fine thank you
I use this stay matte primer which is
from Rimmel and this is primer is really
good I remember one time it was so hot
I wore this and it was amazing like it
actually kept my oil down and I have dry
skin so when I get oily is because of my
foundation it's not because I have oily
skin and then recently I brought this
NYX pore filler which looks like this
and this actually works because my pores
seem to look really big when I put my
makeup on which I don't like so this
helps to fill them and it makes my skin
look much more porcelain and pretty than
just this alone and then recently
Alondra who is was who was Miss makeup
artist here on YouTube she doesn't do
videos anymore but she is on Instagram
I'll put her instagram below she
actually I did a tutorial on Instagram
and then she had posted that this stay
matte finished this right here it works
it makes sure that your makeup doesn't
come off and I tried this I wet my face
up real good with it and it helped so
these three things actually helped my my
face they Mac throughout the day the
next thing is this eyeliner pencil which
is what this is what I used to do my
winged liner look I'm not professional
like I told you in the beginning of this
video and it's very hard for me to use
the gel liner which I'm actually
practicing and I'm getting better at but
in order for my eyes to look like this I
cannot use that I would have to use one
of these so this is the Kat Von D ink
liner now when I first when I was me and
Jada who's the owner of princess hair
shop me and her I went to Sephora and
went buck wild and we were like we just
gonna try new stuff we're gonna try new
stuff and um I tried the other one she
has and it dried out on me like the
second day I had it this one
I brought when I went back and
complained it's afford the girl was like
done by that one by this one so this is
the ink liner this works if you're
trying to learn I'm gonna do a tutorial
on this because a lot of people said
they have issues with learning how to do
winged liner or just really thick black
liner because it's very difficult hard
to get it to dry out unlike that other
one the other one was just not about
that life so um yeah I would definitely
suggest this I got it from Sephora I
think it was like uh $19 but I don't do
my makeup everyday so this actually
allows me of there
so if you're not a daily makeup wearer
this would actually be perfect you have
a lot of questions about what I use
while my lips and what are the
components that I use to do my lips
recently I posted a picture on Instagram
because I was planning my makeup and I
did like the Star Trek straight eyebrows
I'll put the picture right here but I
thought it was dope and I did like this
ombre lip it was on accident and I can't
do that look again so I don't know what
to tell you I tried it but it didn't
look like that um but I'll tell you what
I used um I used this lip liner which is
a Mac lip liner in chestnut this is the
one that alia used to always use if you
watch one in a million the video you
will know what I'm talking about because
that's when she was they was making sure
you seen that liner so I use this to
line my lips and then I use this
lipstick which is my Tom Ford this is
nude vanilla so it's number 12 I used
this in the middle of it I think you
just blot like this and then eventually
the colors will start to blend together
and then you'll start to see this ombre
look and then I take my favorite lip
gloss ever which is NARS it's Turkish
Delight and I take that and I put that
over my lips to kind of give it some
shine because what this is a very drying
lipstick okay and if you don't put no
moisture on it you're gonna start to get
those ugly lines right here when you
talk and it's yeah it's not cute use
this what I do you I'll use this color
which is my wire cell this is the nude
beige so this is the color that you guys
have been seeing me wear for freaking
ever is this color however I think it's
this one it I have two of these but one
is a little bit darker yeah that's the
right one because this one is a little
bit like on the darker side but these
are very like nude but they're moisture
shine so they are not drying so if I
don't have I'm gonna go somewhere and I
know for a fact that I'm gonna do a lot
of talking chances are I'm not gonna
wear a ton for it I'm gonna wear this
because I don't want my I don't want you
to be talking to me and looking at the
creases in my mouth getting crusty and
white it's not cute so yeah those are
the things that I use um I guess I can
do a tutorial on this same look I keep
doing tutorials on I don't
it keeps getting better but you know
it's listen I do what I can
um but yeah I also use this uh
everything that I use - which showed you
I used on my face except for the color
that's in my tear ducts this is from my
the glitter from my Naked 3 palette so
that's pretty much it but yeah I keep it
very simple I'm not one person who's
like I use like 85 products I mean it
seem like a lot but it's not as many as
it seems you know but I hope you guys
did enjoy this little haul and I'll come
back when I buy more stuff one more
thing somebody asks me what lashes I use
as you guys can see I brought right
because I use the same eye lashes all
the time but these are the DaVinci
number one black these I get them from
our local Beauty Supply
they're very natural as you can see no I
don't listen I'm extra when it comes to
my clothes but I don't want my face to
be too extra you know so I like to just
keep it very demure and just regular so
yeah um those are things that I use on a
regular basis when it comes down to
makeup I'm not really wanting to have
like I need like 50 foundations and I'll
mix this and I mix that because luckily
I have a skin toned I don't have to mix
but I know my friend she's on she's like
a brown complexion she has an issue
we're trying to find foundations that
work for her or concealers that work
that don't make her look crazy so I hope
you guys enjoyed this and I would catch
y'all in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
