baby mama yeah mm-hmm so this is my body
wave her from a mom mom I'm trying to
pretty pissed off with me because taken
forever but I had to make sure what's
brought okay so we're gonna start cuz I
still have like all of my stuff like
from when I did it try my hardest right
now to remember what my limbs and stuff
work cuz it's been so long so I'm trying
to see if the papers are in here I know
for a fact that oh Lord
so I'm just I'm gonna try to remember
cuz clearly it's not in here I just see
one of these thinking one of these just
say 14 that's it and I believe that was
my front so I think my frontal is a 14
inch it's a 13 by 4 I know that and then
my bundles
I believe are 224 what I went in did was
I took this bond and I did the
traditional wand method which where you
just curl it you curl it from the
biggest part here and then I curl it all
the way down like Serge holds it and
then let it go and then that's how I
ended up with this very spiral situation
there's two things that I don't like
about this hair the first thing that I
don't like is that I don't know if they
change their webs or whatever but the
west's are kind of thick and it does
give you more hair because it is very
extremely full so that's a great thing
about it does give you nice full hair so
I wish I had an example of like another
weft or whatever but I don't but this is
what the weft looks like and usually I'm
used to like Norwest they're like half
of this size with the same amount of
hair on them but they're not so thick
and this is not by any means SuperDuper
thick but it's more thick to my liking
because I do like my hair to be
extremely flat and sometimes when you
have lifts that are a little bit on the
thicker side like this when you try to
put like Joe glass your last track in
and then trying to pin the hair over it
if it is too thick it's harder to
conceal so that was my only thing by no
means are they super thick but as of
recently all the hair that I've been
getting probably the last nine months
have been not this since I've been going
back and doing all of these reviews I've
been noticing like a lot of
inconsistencies in like the different
the different factories in that whole
thing now as far as the the pattern goes
I had to go and put this pattern in
because after I washed it the body wave
it was no more it was it was a slight
wave it does pretty much good but it
pretty much filled out fill out but I
wanted to keep it in like a curly style
something that was very cute into the
point that you guys can see someone let
you guys get closer so this is what it
looked like after I've pretty much been
doing this all day and running my
fingers through it and I just put this
unit on when I'm ready to go out so as
you can see like right here this is
where all of it I didn't calm any of
this out for this very purpose because
after you can see it looks like this and
it eventually become like a pillow like
this and it just gets bigger and bigger
as you run your fingers through it and
then the second thing that I don't like
about this hair my frontal was big you
know like my frontal is a bit bigger
like up under here I couldn't even like
it comes too far forward that means I
would have it
into it which I plan to do but I didn't
want to do it into this review was done
so you can see what exactly what I was
saying I don't want to do it and be like
that's what I did but yeah when you have
frontals that are a little bit too big
and they come too far forward or
whatever you can just cut through them
just to make them bigger I would rather
your frontals be too big than too small
because when H is small it's a wrap
now I did the the typical method or
whatever where I just go ahead and wash
condition
I'll microwave a little bit put it in
and the hair is nice so I can't do this
with no problems for those who are going
to ask about shedding and or tangling
even after I did the wanna curls
baby still does this and everybody knows
if you can't do this it's a wrap so yeah
haven't been getting anything okay well
there you go
all that that was that one so yeah and
as far as like like what I recommend
from from a 1 to a 10 I'll give them a 9
like I don't think there's nothing
that's majorly wrong with the hair that
like a stuff that I personally feel you
probably just wouldn't care about your
numbers in if it was something like
horrible shedding or a digging color or
something like that now I did do a
strand test for a piece of this and it
seemed like it would bleach with no
problems but which you have to remember
is that you're not gonna get a body
later after you bleach it like it's
gonna be demonstrate so keep that in
mind so if you think you're gonna get
this nice beautiful wave after you've
done bleached it to here to Mars know
though you're not gonna do that it's not
gonna retain its it's not gonna retain
its style hence why I went ahead and did
this even though I didn't even bleach it
but if I did want to bleach this hair I
would do it um I actually have some
other hair that I did that was body wave
and I bleached it and made it a color
and it came out beautiful so it just
depends on though the factory it depends
on how their stuff is set up and if they
actually produce good quality hair and
then you know steam process it into this
or do they just have really bad
out here and they steam process it
anyway and then you try to bleach it and
then just fall apart or start smoking or
something like that so yeah they get
annoying for me I haven't had any major
issues with Matt glam not ever though
like I I've always liked their hair and
my reviews I've always had fun with
their hair and this one was no different
it was just that like I told you guys
people want to go body wave crazy so
every time you guys see body wave on me
it's gonna look different it's not gonna
be in its natural state cuz I'm just
really over it but yeah I hope you guys
like this if you got any questions like
I said my frontal was a 13 by 4 frontal
so it definitely stops very close stops
right here um and then again it was a
little too big for me I don't know like
it says 13 by 4 so it should have fit me
like my other ones but for whatever
reason this one just like with all this
space
even after I did my wig and I did them
all the same in the same way cap it just
it comes really forward so I'm just
gonna go when our because I'm wearing
this again girl I'm you mister I'm just
gonna cut like from where these side
pieces are I'm gonna cut these off and
then make it a little bit further back
just to my liking but I do like the
style and I'm probably gonna add the
extra hair that's in that box to this
ponytail so just it's bigger and it's
fuller but I just wanted to give you
guys a look at what it look like before
him before I started doing all of these
modifications for it ya know so if you
guys are interested hit the links below
let me know what y'all thinking and and
I will catch you guys in my next one
