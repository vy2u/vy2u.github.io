okay hey mm-hmm that's not filling right
now so my hair air yeah I really liked
his hair like for real I like the style
I like the hair I like everything about
it and his Le Express I keep telling you
I'm trying to find these gems and they
keep they keep popping up pretty
frequently around Christmas time
coincidentally so this here is from a
new company that I've never worked
before called
uh max glam and I've had this hair since
October the end of October
I've had this hair so it's been on a
nice little ride with me um that's far
so I'm currently rocking the Brazilian
deep wave and I'm rocking uh I'm walking
three on only three bundles can you
believe it only three bundles Jana hi am
I like eight bundles but this is only
three bundles um and I have a closure a
lace closure as well so I have a 24 a 22
and a 24 my bundles and I have a 16 inch
lace closure that is free partying that
has the exact same row pattern so what I
went ahead and did so that this could
match in this particular style what I
did was I took the roots of the closure
and I flat ironed them so it looks like
my hair is slicked into and then I just
went ahead and curled my hair but it
came like this I've been wearing his
hair
ever since I received it and I finally
get to like review it because this is
some really good nice hair and I have Co
washed it one time and my curls I used
some curl cream and they popped back
they didn't leave or anything but they
definitely I came back to his regular
definition as to when I first received
the hair so I think after about four
wears Eiko washed it after another four
layers I washed it then Co washed it
which was the last time before I put it
back in this is on a full wig so hunting
us out right now is my edges and use I
yah
kind of really feeling this a whole lot
like you know either go put in my little
ghetto earrings because I feel like it
went with the thing you know I'm the
hair itself I didn't get much shedding
and because it is a deeper um is a
deeper curl like I told you sometimes
you do get a lot of shedding but I have
not received much at all but I have
received some so it's not like it's just
been free no no no I received some um
the bundles when I received them the
wefts were very well constructed so they
did not really change
they didn't split or break or you know
say or any of that or cause my hair to
start shedding really really bad they
actually were good the ends of the hair
actually matched the top of the hair
when I received the reason why I'm
different this particular style
I'm versus something else is because
I've only done this on my Italian yaki
before and I thought you could actually
see how thick and full this hair is with
only three bundles you know in a closure
that was it it would look like I got
like five bundles in but it's only three
and the bundles were not abnormally long
they were the same length is all the
mothers I get in that particular length
so it wasn't nothing different about it
it's just that the hair is actually some
really good nice hair after wearing it
I've worn up I've worn down I've worried
in like a bun a messy bun I've knotted
it up one time because I have my top
down in my car and I it was everywhere
you know so I was okay and then after a
minute of it blowing it just tend to get
a little bit frizzy if you got a
convertible just so if what I for my
convertible family out there so um yeah
I had to go ahead and do conditioned in
Washington but once I did it it came
back to this again and then again like I
told you guys and a lot of you guys I
think from the last time I said this
y'all have been doing this and it's work
but I dry my curly hair and sometimes my
way to here upside down so since this is
the only entire wig I just take the wig
and I'm you know flip it upside down and
then I just simply let it dry so all the
curls are not hanging they actually are
this way so they sit on top of one
another so when I do dry they stay like
this so it's like
way like when you have a blow dryer with
diffuser on it and you want your curls
to stay beautiful and luminous
that's what you would do but um to be a
little bit different I just simply
wanted to go and do that because again
their units I take them off I wash them
hang them up and then grab something
else and then once they're done I don't
have to wait on it so it's it's
definitely some decent hair and I want
to thank the company for being very
patient because again I've had this hair
for quite some time and I've just been
waiting to review it because I've been
like I just want to make sure that it's
great I want to make sure that is and
it's very very very nice
so this hair is definitely a keeper for
me I mean you guys ever had a hair from
exilim here let me know here store on
Aliexpress if you just want to type it
in although it should be below is Thor
it's al Express for a slash store 4/1
6-2 7-6 7-3 and it says how come was a
little scanner a barcode scanner on it
which i think is convenient cuz you can
just scan your phone and then it'll go
to the site and it says that they claim
that it is 100% human hair now one of
the great things that I've noticed about
this hair versus some of my other
Aliexpress brands um that is are like
curly or deep wave as it had no smell
when I tell you no smell it had
absolutely positively no smell at all
like it was like nothing so I'm like ok
I see I see y'all and it could have been
the fact that this hair possibly was
against sting process which only
requires steam and not chemicals so to
get this to to be in this beautiful wave
and again the more you run your fingers
through it it was bigger yesterday but I
had to throw some crow cream on it and
then kind of calming down so you guys
can see the uniform this of it you know
and so this is the Brazilian deep wave
and check them out
I wanted I want to try some of their and
their their straight hair is as good as
this
here I think I found like one-stop shop
for everything well I don't know what
they wait here is like but we get some
wavy and from straight hair from them
that's like this then I think we're done
with Elias first you know so um let me
know what you guys think of the style
let me know what you guys think of this
hair if you like it if you don't like it
just be respectful in the comments to
myself and went in and then oh and then
yeah we can go from there
merry little Christmas um but um you
guys get this and I will catch y'all
later
