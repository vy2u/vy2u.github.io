different with no light it's just those
lights on let's see okay let me see if I
can get romantic real quick Odom
Oh
hany okay so this is very different well
not really I've done this before but for
I'm doing this in the wig I've never
done this on a wig that I've made you
know I've always left the cutting to
either my sister or some professionals
but felt like I did a nice so this hair
is from Max glam and this is actually an
Aliexpress vendor you guys know I work
with max clan before um some of my
favorite looks one of the wigs that I
did for them which was a it was like a
curly I did like half up half down any
was really curly my sister now owns that
wig and she's totally up says she's a
girl who's very my younger sister she's
very low-maintenance when it comes down
to hair so she needed something that she
can just like put on and go and
literally every single time I see her be
like cause she's in New York so we talk
on FaceTime and I she bug in my hair
you know my hair is so good so she's not
having any issue and from a girl who's
not really well-versed in hair that kind
of says a lot
now this hair is they're Brazilian
straight and when I would what I will
say about the company before I even go
any further is they were very patient
I've had this hair since March okay
I've had this here since nice and March
and they hit me up one time about and it
was like you know we were wondering if
you were going to be able to do it
sometime in June and you guys know I
moved in June so it's been like I just
I'm backed up to the max I'm not taking
no more new reviews until February of
next year like that's how I got to get
everybody done um so they were very
patient they did not come to me they did
not threaten me I've been threatened
before or any of that they were very
very very very nice about me getting to
this and I was very happy because I
wanted to live with this hair a little
bit longer than I normally would for
straight hair just because it went from
being straight and long to being this
short on one side and more
on the other side and I kind of want to
see how it was gonna add so I am wearing
their Brazilian straight and I'm wearing
three bundles 303 I am wearing a 20 or
22 and a 24 and I will say it's a little
refreshing like I said I like to do the
shorter bundles for you guys who are not
into the led thickness um but I did like
the fact that I was able to do it and it
still has a lot of body to it leg
I couldn't blunt when I did it I cut
everything like legit straight across
blunt and I went in and took my thinning
shears and thinned it out so that it
just wasn't oh I have you from LA watch
the news the you know Christine Devine
is and if you know Christine Devine is
if you don't know you're not from LA
Google her her hair has been thick and
blunt since I was a embryo so you know
how thick this hair was once I cut it
now this was four bundles and I cut it I
probably wouldn't have been able to get
away with this but because it was on a
three I was able to get away with
shedding let's get your shedding I did
experience like that much shedding and
that's when I first received the hair I
didn't sell my website this hair I
didn't do anything abnormally different
with this hair that I would do with any
other hair I just kind of let it hit the
elements and let it do it it was now
they send me a 16 inch closure for this
hair clearly you can tell that I am not
wearing a closure I opted to use a
frontal that I had from a pre-existing
wig because it I found a frontal well I
have a frontal that is the exact length
of that hair and I wanted to be like
literally like blunt and just long and
this one wasn't it was I believe it was
16 inches so I opted to take this one
out and put it in this hair so when I
first received the hair I had it with a
16 inch lace closure then I kind of wore
it with that but during the time that
they sent it I was just kind of getting
into frontal so I was like when they
asked me was half a heroine it I just
said I wanted the hair that they you
know they're straight hair and I went
a master enclosure now that I've kind of
graduated thank you um to frontals I
wanted to see what it would look like
and how I would act uh with the frontal
and I loved it much better with this
versus I did with the closure you know
um so that was the only difference from
the initial wear of this particular hair
but after I wore it a little bit I've
noticed that it did stop the shedding
issue stop and it was only it was like
every so often but obviously now I'm not
gonna get anything because I cut all the
ends off and usually that's where most
of the snagging comes from but yeah once
you cut it you're not going to get it so
if you have a person like usually I tell
people when you buy here and you you
know you want to wear it sometimes you
want to wear it straight out the box
just make sure that even if you're
wearing straight out the box you go
ahead and you clip the ends when I do
reviews I very rarely will clip the ends
of hair because I want you guys to know
how it acted as the ends were still
intact
usually right after I'll go in and chop
all the ends the dead ends whatever it
is they're scraggly or whatever in my 40
inch hair I did that some on here
probably 36 inches now cuz I got a lot
of that hair off but um once I do an
update before that hair you guys will
hear more about that but yeah it's once
you do it once you cut that little bit
so if you give a 24 and you cut it to a
22 chances are and you don't have to cut
that much you don't have to cut two
inches or you can cut eight inches of an
inch off or half an inch off and you'll
be fine but that always helps even when
you trim your real hair it does it makes
your hair feel better it makes your hair
look better it gives it more life
because it's not being weighed down by
something that is technically either not
great not intact it's you know saying
but sometimes you do get hair that
straight out the box straight after a
co-wash is great you don't have to cut
anything but if you ever run into that
issue because this is hair that has been
discounted so you're going to run into
things that you may not necessarily run
into if you bought more expensive hair
this is more on the affordable end so
when it's more affordable you have to do
a little bit more to make it last a
little bit longer pretty much as far as
the color goes I didn't put any
his hair I was one of my followers and I
remember who it was I probably haven't
even replies to the message yet but I
did see it on Instagram and she was like
I'm trying to get this look and it was a
girl where Bob like this but it was a
color from here down which I thought was
ridiculously bomb beautiful and I just
didn't have the time to do this like
that but I will find the time to do so
this hair is definitely a 1b for sure um
it has a nice brown it's not crazy black
but it's definitely not a 14 I went
ahead and just chopped it up you know
and then textured it out a little bit
just so we can have a little flow and
then I use the front tool that I have
and you guys can see it right here where
this damn piece of hair is um this one
frontal is and I did kind of go over
crazy with the concealer but just
because I was kind of in a rush because
it is almost midnight so yeah I was
filling on you know you get your little
old school jams and you start really
feeling it that's what yes uh-huh so
after all of these months this is what
my hair looks like and I will say it is
definitely holding up max glam we bout
three for three right now and I will say
this here is some of the nicest straight
hair and the most flexible straight hair
that I've dealt with it did I will say
that my bundles were a bit on the long
side as far as you know width wise it
was a lot of hair and when I did put it
in initially because I have a closure it
fit great but after putting a frontal
line it kind of changed the dynamic um
so I had to figure out how to wiggle it
in I didn't get all the hair in but that
was fine I got most of it in so I will
say their bundles if they're if yours
are anything like mine's then three
bundles should be more than enough for
you to do a forehead or styled like such
I promise you three bundles will be so
much enough and I got a texture at the
bottom some more to make it a little bit
more
um tapered but again because of time
reasons um you know you kid didn't have
it but aside from that I'm super in love
with this oh this cut I love the color I
love the style I love the fact that I
can be um and pink lipstick and a short
haircut but I got on a shirt with myself
where I got on light pink lipstick and
blonde hair so you know I love Hello
options if you guys are interested in
this hair in any sorts any capacity make
sure you guys hit up a maximum for sure
because they're one of those um they're
one of my favorites when it comes down
to UM Aliexpress because they I always
get great hair and I always hear back
great things about them I barely really
hear people speak bad of their name so
if you guys want you just did put that
below and I know somebody's going to ask
two questions am I going to sell these
shirts I don't know yet I got um this
one just made for me um but if you guys
are interested just let me know you guys
know I'm going to merchandise whore like
that so I don't really make things just
to sell them I usually make things for
me and people like a masala and then uh
the other thing is well I do a video
showing how I put my frontal on and yes
I will do that I did it in a got erased
um was it was corrupted and then um well
I show a video on this click in is a
basic cut cut it from here and go down
in the back taper it and bump it
you good so I'll catch all in my next
one purse</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
