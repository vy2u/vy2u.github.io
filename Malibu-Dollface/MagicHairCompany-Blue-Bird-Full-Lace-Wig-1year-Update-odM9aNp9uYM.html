so you guys like my hair ok I don't know
if you guys remember this a hair from
magic hair company that I had reviewed
this hair Oh Lord it's been like over a
year year for sure I'll put the original
video that this was for um yeah this was
a moment ago I felt like somebody from
gym and a Holograms right now that's
what I'm feeling like which I'm loving
um so to this hair this is gonna be a
bit of an update for what's been going
on with this hair since I last reviewed
it and that whole thing so you guys know
this is a full lace unit that I got from
magic hair company many many moons ago
and this particular unit arm was a 613
when I received it and the roots were
already I took it and used aquamarine
from a door on it and I got this color
well this has been the color ever since
I dyed it this is in the color and I
remember specifically doing this because
I was going to a break up during that
time and I remember just being like I
just want to try some because I'm using
video minor but that was like one of the
stupidest things ever but ok anyway so
um I did this color and it's been this
color I believe I only use one color for
this so yeah I used that one color on
this hair and it's legit I have not
redundant hair since I washed it plenty
of many times and yeah baby still
kicking so what I did was I took it and
I just put it in a ponytail here so I
glued it all down I just didn't feel
like I'm gonna be
totally 100 my job I didn't feel like
really flattening out my roots because
this could this was originally supposed
to be two ponytails and then that
changed um so I didn't feel like doing
that so I just thought I'd do like a
fauxhawk mohawk mullet get down
um and then what I did was I took my
wand and I wanted all of the hair so
this is not the original pattern for the
hair but as you can see I pretty much
made my own natural curly look by pretty
much winding it and then running my
fingers through it and I got this so
I've got no shedding since I've been
using and I go through this little puppy
every now and then I'll pull it back out
and try something new and it always pops
back I don't know why the color hasn't
faded on it I don't know if it has
anything to do with the hair the vendor
and or the color it could be all three I
don't know but I'm happy because as you
guys see out on a white jacket in my
color it's not rubbing off on my jacket
whatsoever you guys know that usually
when you do have color especially a
color that is so dark and if it starts
to fade and start getting more of this
would have been a baby blue by now have
this probably been like jazzing or any
of those colors that just don't stick if
it's not a door I manic panic mean
usually it just ain't gonna work
I went ahead and said my god to be glued
and blue baby all the way down so yeah I
can you can literally I can get it off
but it's gonna take a little off to get
it off this is what the I did not did
this curl pattern the thing of massage
ABAB I did this while the hair was in
its natural state so I did not
straighten the hair and then wand it I
just simply let it air dry I ran my
fingers through the because it was more
of uh I want to say like more of a like
a looser wave when it was in its natural
state so I just let it um dry like that
I ran my fingers through it and then I
took my wand so I'll show you which one
cuz I get a lot of questions when I do
barn curls on any of my hair
about which ones at that I use and I
usually don't remember what like barrel
size it is to hold on okay
sorry I was on Instagram and some bitch
decided to have an opinion so I had to
have one too so listen this is the one
that I use I have two of these this one
is pink I think my other one is like
blue it might be Dakota Meyer and I I
only use when I did it only use this
section right here unlike a really tight
tight curl I didn't want a barrel girl
so that's why I just used the this part
I'll hold it for about two three seconds
then let it go and I just did I did nice
big sections and that's how I ended up
with these curls I feel like Prince
child you know Prince could be my daddy
he could have been to bed along too
young but you know that would have been
a nice fortune to be yeah so I just used
this I let it sit and then what I did
was these curls set for about four days
and then I let them kind of start to
draw because they were really tight when
I did it um you don't have to do that I
just did it because I had other things
that I was doing so I was going between
this one and my other blue hair so yeah
what I ended up so I just have time to
let it fall so they kind of relaxed
itself but if you do do this and you
want it to relax a bit quicker which can
do is just run your fingers to it and
kind of hold it for a couple of seconds
and then let it spring back it
eventually start to fall and then it's
going to look more relaxed but as you
can see like if I pull these they'll
start to see but I legit feel like a
member of like Jem and the Holograms
like that's what I'm feeling right now
and I'm loving every moment of it home
that nose contour honey I made sure it
looked like I had a nice nose job could
be like well you should bling your nose
contour no I shouldn't I don't know I
want you to see it I don't want to blend
it no I want you to look I wanted to
look like my nose was reconstructed ya
know so yeah it's been this long and
this hair is still beautiful it still
got luster to it it still got shine to
it it's gorgeous
so magic hair company
youngest you know she knows she doing
and I'm happy about it
so yeah you guys will be seeing this
hair not for sale
I'm not selling this one this one's
staying with Mama I'm telling this one
but um you guys will be seeing more of
it I'll do more styles and stuff like
that with it but I just felt this was it
was necessary and it's different from
what I'm usually doing - um I just try
something I think today was very
different from me okay I tried different
makeup I tried different lip I tried
