than what you guys are used to but this
is the second installment of my great
series of hair um this actually is oh
it's a full lace wig that I'm wearing
and I have a I found a picture on a one
si was Instagram but I want to say it
was maybe Pinterest but it might have
been tumblr I don't know it's so much
stuff out you guys I really couldn't
tell you cuz I don't know but I seen a
picture of like a vintage Barbie which
so much should be somewhere in this
video and she had like a bow in her hair
and she is really even bangs um but I
didn't want them to be blonde I tried it
blonde
I should probably can see it between
here as well I try to blind and it just
didn't like it um but I do want some
bangs and I did want these big full of
female like I don't want human looking
bangs I wanted some some Barbie looking
bangs so yeah this is actually a unit
from magic hair company and this hair
would I received it like my other hair
it was like white when I received it it
was very light it was lifted I think to
the brink so I really didn't have an
issue with trying to get this color I
did the same thing I used the same color
that I used on all my other colors she
wishes should be over there or over here
one of these today I'm never centered in
my video y'all notice that but anyway um
see ya I just wanted to try something
like a little Barbie looker and whatnot
because you guys know I love Barbie I'm
obsessed and I've never had bangs a day
in my life before and I actually really
like them they look better with makeup
as you can see the name
when it's just regular I had on these
earrings which were my actually would be
like this which are my big Barbie
vintage 1987 hearings but they were
really heavy or whatever so they're
really good for future purposes but not
really not really functional as you can
say this unit is a glue this unit is a
silky touch it was silky straight
the color is 613 it's a small cap in the
length of it is 26 I didn't cut much of
it I didn't cut no length off I just put
like a little layer in the front just so
that it could not look so or whatever
somewhere in this video should be
actually another video of me with it
with no scarf on and I like it like that
too but I'm not like SuperDuper excited
about it this is a type of hair don't
get me wrong this is I'm just doing like
a series I don't really wear I wouldn't
wear this to the mall but then again I
probably would know me um if I had the
black roots I didn't put the black from
so I could match my sideburns I didn't
make the roots black cuz I just didn't
have time to do it and I didn't really
want to do it on this way cuz I like it
all grey and you know it's just to do
this color and all that but what I did
was I just took out of the league
wet it put the color in it let it stay
it for and out I posted how I did the
color cuz it's one more big wig I have
to do that it's great to that's another
style as well um when I put on Instagram
that you have to let the color sit for
like like 30 hours people were like or
ouch 30 hours is so long there are 24
hours in one day okay we are clear on
that okay so if you let the damn wig sit
for like a day and a half before you do
it or the hair sit I didn't have before
you do it then there you go it's not
like you sitting up there tapping your
foot like oh my god but again this is a
very thin rinse it is not a thick rinse
so it's not like a door it's not like
these other colors it has no develop
inner is
Arendt if you do not let the colors sit
for a very long period of time what's
going to happen is your hair is going to
be a washed out lavender greyish color
it will not be this color if you're
trying to rush it if you don't have time
to color your hair then this is not the
color that you should do this color
takes no time to do but it takes out
quite some time to process now it
probably might not take 30 hours but I
left mines in for that long because I
had other things to do so I'll just do
it in a ziplock bag through the color in
there
swash it around and in every couple of
hours I would just take it in the bag
and there you go and then once you're
done this would be the whole entire
situation so yeah I love it
it's she I one thing I loved about magic
hair company is that and I had the same
thing with my lacy you part is that the
her units are usually 150 density like
the stock units are 150 density so this
hair is very very thick it's not thin at
all it's actually quite thick and I cut
a lot of it off in order to do these
bangs so you see I think my bangs are
imagine if all that his hair was still
here and I wouldn't you know they're
like a side part or a middle part with
it or whatever it would be way thicker
than this but that's one thing I love
because people forget when it's straight
or it has texture to it or whatever it
was a silky straight I just threw these
curls in here I think yesterday when I
tried this on and I had cut it or
whatever but people forget when you get
these units and stuff like that they're
not styled they look thick and then as
soon as you throw in it just looks
really thin which sucks so yeah but I
can't really say anything bad about this
to be so very honest with you if you're
trying to do like the stand for
Halloween or you want to do bar because
there is a Barbie we're great we right
here and no she is not the old part okay
like I understand why people aren't you
still think that gray is just dictated
to old people no it's not it's a color -
it's not that ashy gray it's not that
jacked-up gray it's nice great like it
has some Sheen has some dimension to it
like in all of my bangs
so I don't get what the haters say I
love it and I have one more color coming
in this gray at another spot I mean
another color a warmer style coming in
the grain but yeah I feel like throwing
on my my Barbie jacket and my Barbie
scarf with this and I guess I'll do a
video I keep saying I'm gonna do it if
you can tie your shoes you can tie a bow
in your hair it's not that difficult
eyes this whole tutorial thing is just
me leaving me to be trying to do
whatever I also kind of low-key feel
like Gaga and pokerface because her
bangs were like this so yeah but I do
love the color though in the texture is
very very soft so you know I'm trying
not to disturb my curls or whatever but
clearly that they're gone because I've
done that but you get what I'm saying um
I didn't get any shedding which I love I
didn't get any shitty not one strand
came out when I combed through this wig
maybe because I didn't lift anything
maybe because I'm the cut anything there
were in the wefts maybe that's why I
don't know but I don't have to cut
nothing but the only hair that I seen
was when I actually cut it so and
sometimes you get lace wigs and then
they shed like a mangy Mutt and it's
horrible it does have two combs as you
know two combs on each side and then it
has lace in the back and a hat lace
around the perimeter so I combined this
down if I wanted to but with veins that
was my point I didn't want to have to
bond it down because yeah because if I
would award this if I would have wore
blond what would end up happening was I
would have to somehow bleach
I mean tin the roots darker or I would
have to bleach my hair in order to make
it that color and we are not doing that
so I decided to just go ahead with some
bangs because one I had never had bangs
before - I love Barbie and this is
definitely a Barbie hair Scott you know
Barbie little things and I just wanted
to kind of make it a little funky
instead of doing a traditional blonde I
wanted to do something like right so
yeah let me know if you love it if you
don't like it just you can say that you
don't like it just say it in a
respectful manner and the
go forward and let me know what you guys
think that my next look will be and I
will talk to you guys later
remember this is from magic hair company
this wig was actually before I go this
way was custom
so it took a minute for me to get
because of the length and the color so
if you want a custom unit she can't do
custom units for you so remember that if
you have like a prom photo shoot or
something that you need something custom
like a color or whatever she did it for
me I don't think she does any other
colors as far as I don't think she like
dies here like she I don't give you no
green hair but you know natural color is
like a brown or a 1ve or a white so yeah
so yeah I make sure if you are in the
Los Angeles area that you visit their
store on Washington I'll leave that
address down below it's a beautiful
store I was just there yesterday and
yeah I will talk to you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
