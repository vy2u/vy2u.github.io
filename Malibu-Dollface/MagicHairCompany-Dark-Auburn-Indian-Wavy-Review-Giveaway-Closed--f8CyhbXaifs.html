I guess I gotta leave you alone
- ah - I okay so I'm here to tell you
about this nice luxurious hair I'm
rocking from magic their company now you
guys know magic hair company was one of
the first companies that I've ever
reviewed and I think that was my
Filipino hair which I no longer have I
think I gave to someone which I really
did like because it was really nice and
full but they still rock the hair to
this very day so yeah um this is about
this particular hair that I'm rocking
and I did not color this here it came
like this which is like something I'm
excited about except for my question my
closure actually had a color result so
let's get to the specs of everything and
um the origin and all the gusto
so I'm rocking four bundles of Indian
wavy and I'm rocking got my notes so I'm
rocking a - I think - 30s yeah - - 30s
and dark Auburn and these are Indian
wavy so these are the tags that you'll
receive if you do indeed buy this or any
other hair with all the information on
it and then I have a 28 and dark are
burn and Indian lady and I have a 26 and
a darker bar dark all burn uh as well so
when we were discussing which particular
hair I went to the store which is what
the information to the store be below um
if you're in the south SoCal area and
you want to go to the extra store to
kind of pick it out and meet the owner
and all that I'll put all the
information on below other dates times
and phone number
but I went to the store and it been had
it's been a while since we worked
together and has been a specific reason
why we haven't worked together just you
know girl I've been on a hair run um so
when I was looking at the hair she was
like what kind of hair do you want and I
was like I just want something different
that I haven't done before because I
promised myself this year especially
with my channel I was going to start
doing things that I haven't done hair
color style whatever and so far so good
so I was like I want to try
something different and then I seen this
color before and I was like I want to
try it the only downside about it is
that she didn't have a matching closure
to go with it so I was like saying what
can I do and I hate happen to bleach
hair is just such it's so taxing on the
hair so I hate to have to do it even if
it's just a closure but you know what
you can do is she gave me a closure that
was like it wasn't a 613 it wasn't that
bright it was a little bit darker and
she was like you could just you know try
to find an Auburn color that should
match this color because it looked brown
on camera but it actually had some red
in it um that could actually match this
so I was like okay so I went and was
searching and could not find an Auburn
for my life to match this color and I
was just like I don't know what I'm
gonna do because I need this to match
exactly so what I did was I was afraid
that when I did find the color which I
use the L'Oreal color excellent in life
Auburn um I thought if I it depends a
little bit darker the closure
and then I put our dark our burn on it
it's going to end up being too dark for
my hair and I'm have like an ombre
situation going on so I opted for light
offering which ended up giving me this
color which I was like I would rather my
hair be a little bit lighter than too
dark because I'm nothing look that I
want because it would have muted out the
color at the bottom of my top was like
if this was this color it would have
just made it look like I had highlights
versus an actual color so this is what
the light Auburn did to the closure that
I had I don't have any pictures of the
closure of what it looked like but
pretty much whatever up under I don't
know what color that would meet up under
a 613
that's what color it was it was more
like a muted yellowish color so when I
received the hair which I'll put some
footage here um it was wavy it was not
straight like this it definitely was
wavy um I have my longest bundles are 30
and they are true thirties because it's
curled and it comes here but if I pull
it it definitely comes to like my pocket
so what I did was I was like okay I'm
not gonna wear this hair it is natural
stay because it's nice and I think it's
pretty but I do want to do a particular
style with this where it's kind of
sleeking you you know
you you you you feel it you know Santa's
put happen because you're not looking
insane boom so what I did was I
straightened all my hair out first
and I noticed that when I was
straightening them when I to do it the
first time my hair seemed a little dry
and it could have just simply because it
was treated and a lot of times color
treated hair does depending on what
color it is it may be a little bit dry
but you can always fix that well giving
it a deep condition and that's exactly
what I did I just took this um shampoo
which is my Giovanni's tea tree shampoo
I put this in the back and I set it in
there I put in the microwave like for
five minutes and then I took it out and
then my hair was SuperDuper soft so what
ends up happening a lot of times is you
will get hair that may not be uh you
know if the hair is good or bad if you
get it and it's just crunchy out of
control and it's still black like
there's no reason for this hair to be
like this but even times when I colored
hair it comes out beautifully but it
needs to be a little bit more hydrated
because that's what happens when you
pretty much you treat your hair so once
I did that I ended up making the wig and
you guys know I have a video and I'll do
an update on how I make my wigs and what
caps I use and all of the techniques I
use and all that to make the way once I
made it I went ahead and cut it and then
I rode it I found I mistaken I have a
video on how I made how you can cut your
hair like this and then go ahead and
curl it I believe I do if I don't please
forgive me and if I don't I will
definitely make one because I'm in
tutorial mode right now so so far so
good I really do like it
it's beautiful hair it's something
different and I'm not used to and I
really do like it
and I think Beyonce had her hair like
this once before it's always the reason
why remember this is a gift that they
always use or I mean they always use if
she's laughing and she's like someone
she in a big hallway but or a big room
but her hair is kind of like this and I
was like I really do like if I find the
picture I'll put it here
um but I really do like that color at
the combination of it being a little bit
lighter and then it goes in and even if
I wanted to lift this hair some more is
too I have the ability to do so
cuz on the way it was treated but if you
do get your bundles or you do are you
are going for this particular look again
I use light all burn by L'Oreal color
excellence on the top I just put it on
there I like to sit into the completely
turned um and then I did nothing but go
ahead and condition the bar pretty much
gave this a co-wash in a bit of a deep
condition to make sure that my color was
still poppin I didn't have to do it to
the closure though only had to do it to
the actual bundles at the bottom so I
will say so far so good
because I feel like this works for me I
did have on like a nude lip when I first
did it and I just didn't feel like it
was enough with this hair so I had to
like pack the make up on some all over
the me little darker um because it did
kind of wash me out a little bit with my
complexion so I have a special little
coat for you guys a little discount code
