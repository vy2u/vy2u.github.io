expected because you get me from all
directions closer where somebody's gonna
point it out but I took one of my lashes
off so I only have one lash in this
video oh we're gonna talk about my okay
so this hair is from magic
so you guys I've always said of magic
hair company is one of my favorite
outcome means like ever to work with
because they're so easy to work with
it's always great quality hair that I
get and this is definitely no different
I had this very spontaneous moment where
I was like you know I think I just want
to do my hair blue like blue from the
root blue it was thinking about like
wait at first I was supposed to do
orange cause people kept on saying
please do orange please do orange and
I'm like okay that's cute everything but
I don't really think I want to do orange
I will do it but just I don't know I am
and as you guys can see I'm in a blue
moment right now very blue velvet um so
I decided that I was gonna go to
Michigan company just to see cuz I
hadn't been there in a while and she
contacted me was like you know how
you've been with been going on and I'm
you know we were just kind of catching
us are just one body just kind of say hi
and she was telling me that she was um
she had had like six 13 blonde hair now
and for the longest I have only known
her to have six 13 up in my full wigs I
didn't know her to have it in what the
hair so we got to talking and I was like
I want to kind of do this all Barbie
blonde moment that's what was my
original intention then
uh Keyshia Cole came along so Keyshia
Cole and I kind of started talking via
Instagram and I for whatever reason we
started we went to magic hair company we
were just talking about um color and
what like companies um offer it and she
was like yeah uh what color do you plan
on doing I was like I was thinking about
doing like a navy blue and then she was
like sounds cool cuz I was I just did
blue not too long ago and I really love
my blue so I googled it when I got home
and it wasn't really pretty which I'll
put right here which is like very pretty
like her roots were like a navy blue and
then it went out to a um like a baby
blue and I'm like I really want to try
that Keisha I think is she's a she's
like a smidgen lighter than I am so I
was like okay well the color is still
work I just want to know um kind of what
color she used kind of looked online
couldn't really find anything but I was
like I really want to do that color blue
so I knew that she had 613 and she had
custom ordered me this closure to match
I got my hair while I was there and then
I had to wait like two weeks I believe
and she got me this one I don't think
this is like 28 inches so this custom
it's 13 from the roots down now what
happened was as I'm getting ready to
color my hair I came across this frontal
that I had I don't remember what company
it was from I don't remember I believe I
brought this one on my own I don't think
this was for review and I just didn't
used it I think this was something that
I purchased and totally forgot about it
no how long have I had I don't know but
he did so base oh okay I was like okay
so um I told her that I was going to use
all the hair and then the closure but
then I ended up changing my mind I
didn't realize until I was starting to
do my color that I had five bundles of
hair so I'm wearing a 32 30s to 28 and a
26 yeah that's yeah so I'm quite
fool around these parts okay people as
you can tell from my hair it is very
very very full I feel like Ariel if her
hair what's below you know that's that's
what this little piece here in the front
and when I was a kid Little Mermaid was
my favorite um
Disney cartoon didn't know I was getting
in that's what they say but okay oh I
was like okay I don't know I've never
done this is the first time ever that I
had a frontal with five bundles of hair
and made every last stitch fit but made
it fit and it's fact so um then it left
me with one last thing which was color
like what color do you plan to do and I
knew that I have planned to do um a
variation of color because after I did
my green I was like okay I really want
to make sure that I do this again and do
the dimensions of color I don't want it
to just be one flat blue I wanted it to
be more after looking at Keisha's hair I
was like okay I want to do that but kind
of like times 10 so I use three colors
so so the first color that I use which
was my base color was a baby blue from a
door so most of the color which I'll get
closer most of the color that is in here
is more of a baby blue color like you
can tell like back here mm-hmm
way all in my damn face you're like
right here you can tell this is kind of
where the base of my color is then what
I did was I took which color see oh this
color which is from Manic Panic and this
is called shocking blue I took this
color and I did my roots this darker
blue color then I ran out of color you
know and then I went ahead and as I was
finishing it off for my roots I use this
color which is adores aquamarine which I
used in my other magic hair company wig
which was my big curly so or that entire
wig is just this aquamarine color so one
side
that I was like okay I think I'm kind of
liking how this goes but then I wasn't
really finished so I took some more of
this shocking blue and I played it at
the bottom of my hair so that my hair I
don't think you can really tell on
camera is darker at the bottom than it
is at the top so that's the look that I
was going for I wanted it to be this
dimension of blue but I wanted it to not
look ratchet okay so this is what it
looked like after I did the wig you can
see all the color in it and you can see
how it's darker at the bottom than it is
at the top and it's a little lighter on
the sides um and Jen I came over and
actually cut my layers for me because
she's way better than it than I am but
you see here you can see the variation
of color much better and then this is
the silk base here and it came out
amazing I had wanted it to come out like
really great and I wasn't sure but it
actually came out really really good
okay and this is what I did to get the
achieve the look that I have now I flex
right at the back and I put big rollers
at the top so that it be more relaxed at
the top and much tighter in the back so
I had to make sure that I blended all my
colors well and I had to make sure that
it looked feasible and and and nice to
the eye which I think it does I think it
looks classy for some blue hair you know
a side part with some curls and some
layers I never steered nobody wrong
that's why it's my go-to so once I did
my bundles my last thing that I had to
do was my closure was my frontal okay
now that was a different situation
within itself because I'm not used to
having to be so meticulous about things
and I'll put a photo here of how it
looked like it was stepped like I had
literally like take a little bit of
color put it on the brush and then do
each and every single part of this
frontal to make sure that it was the
exact color that I wanted but it was
just it was so tedious and I didn't
anticipate this being that I thought it
was going to be like a real quick
situation and I didn't expect it to be
as long and take as long as it did but
okay you know um and then also the thing
that I wasn't anticipating either is I
didn't know that it was going to be this
many colors I really was like okay I'm
gonna do two colors and then it turned
into three colors and then it was like
okay when all was said and done I had to
do all five bundles let those dry and
then I had to do the frontal had to let
that dry and I think if if it was a if
it was a lace closure or a lace frontal
I could literally douse the color all
over it and then use some color remover
to just get it off the lace a little bit
later but it would have been a lot less
time but because this is so base so as
you can see this is silk base it's no
lace at all so because it is
bass I couldn't do that because as soon
as that color hits that soap it's a wrap
so imagine how tedious I had to be to
make sure that my part did not get any
color on it was all people but I'm very
happy with the results um I love this
hair to death if you guys are looking
for I mean you guys know I love 6:13
because it's just so versatile and so
much I can do with it and again I can't
say anything bad because I'm SuperDuper
in love with this look like legit it's
just it's literally my green look times
ten and um yeah I magic hair company
never gets me like any issues and this
is what I love especially about
pretreated hair because a lot of times
you guys know blonde doesn't always mean
great with some companies sometimes it
could be a really bad situation and you
can be okay so to go from this to this
and that means that yeah it has to do
with also it has to do with the color
that you use - that's definitely a must
but it also has to do with the type of
hair that you're worried like you're
working with this is really nice I don't
have any use for this anymore so I will
be returning this to her but um Oh
amazing
she did the damn thing I gotta keep it
she did the damn thing so if you guys
are definitely interested in doing
something like this um I would
definitely hit her up now like I said
about our frontal she had this one
custom-made for me because she had none
of these instruction I don't believe she
keeps 613 in stock um for I think she
probably does but not this long I think
this might be like a 28 inch closure
most closures be like a vet long so yeah
um but frontals as well she can have
those ordered so if you plan on doing
something similar to this or were you're
gonna need just this color then I would
definitely email her and ask her because
she can pretty much get anything that
you want so
we'll go for it it's the summertime
summer is close to being over so if you
plan on doing candy colors it is
definitely uh the time to do it now cuz
I don't think this would be to pop in
during winter you know I mean it could
but I think summer is rusty in the Sun
is super bright and that's not going for
it so if you guys are interested make
sure you guys put the links below again
I use I use a manic panics shocking blue
and then I use our doors aquamarine as
well as um the baby blue which I don't
know where the bottle is I believe I
threw those away so if you guys are
interested in this hair make sure you
guys hit the links below and uh make up
today but it looks good at least to me
adieu I'll catch y'all in my next few
piece and if you are in the LA area or
plan to visit make sure you visit magic
carrier company and 86 38 Washington
Boulevard and Culver City you might see
