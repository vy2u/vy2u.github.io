hands down my favorite curly slash wavy
hair ever well so far and this hair is
the Indian deep way from my favorite
company and then the reason is because
I've been working my magic hair company
now I think this is our third time doing
something together found I'm mistaken
and you guys number one it's like curly
big hair kick right now so well just big
hair in general whether it's curly a
nappy I don't care um but yeah this is
about our third or fourth time you know
I don't know I don't know
third time third time cuz the first hair
I have was my Filipino hair if I'm not
mistaken and I was when I had the middle
part and it was bone straightening it
was so for low E and then the second one
I had was the lace you probably Jessica
Rabbit height and all that good stuff so
yeah um this is our third time working
together and I wanna say I love this
hair now I've had this hair for about
I've had it in for about a week and a
half I was supposed to review it last
week but I wanted to wear it a little
bit longer just to kind of see how the
up key cuz it's different when you have
straight hair because after a while
straight hair you know it's gonna be
good but then when you have curly hair
like this you have to make sure that
it's gonna be good because if it's not
you know in when you first put it in
it's always good but if it starts to mad
after a week then you know that's a
problem I just hear a week and a half
ivko washed it once and it's still
poppin okay
now let me tell you the length that I
have in and then I'll tell you the pros
and the cons of this here okay so I got
this a little mixed up about what's
going on so what I have in is I have in
a 16 to 18 I have in a 20 to 22 and I
have in to 24 to 26 and I have a 14 inch
closure I think the reason why these
links are from one to another as far as
you know an inch or two in between is
because it's it's wavy hair so yeah
the length Barry because of the state of
the hair if it's straight it's one
length when it's wavy it's another so
it's between tore three inches give or
take so the closure matches perfectly
with this texture I didn't put no layers
in this hair I just put it and installed
it how it came with the length and then
kind of went from there so this is I'm
gonna pull all the hair forward so you
can see how much it actually is this is
all there and let me tell you it is
Large Marge and in charge okay so the
pros and cons of this hair the pros of
it that I love is the fact that when I
did put water in it because this is the
natural state of the hair I have not put
anything in it since I co washed it a
couple of days ago so this is pretty
much been the this is how it dry I love
the texture I love everything about the
hair except only one con is that it did
shed a bit when I installed it and I
think it's because the texture of it is
not straight so it did share just a tiny
bit not crazy now it was crazy I'll let
y'all know if it was like oh my god is
everywhere but no it only shed it just a
little bit and now I don't I don't get
any shedding when I run my fingers
through it it's all good it's fluffy so
it's I think it's just that initial
because when you receive the hair it has
more of the texture is more like this I
guess you can not a zigzag but you know
what I'm saying it has if you know
hairdo you know what I'm say
it has more of that as like pattern in
it so when you start to pull the hair
apart to install it it's trying to break
away from this so when I was doing that
I was pulling through and I was getting
a couple of snags here and there but
besides that I haven't had any issues
since so other than that I haven't put
anything in it but this organics are
coconut oil and it just kind of keeps it
hydrated because it does have more of a
wild lion situation to it but you don't
want your lion to look a lion dry mess
you know so you see how just putting a
little bit of this it's a lightness
y'all so don't think I'm going it's
weightless so that's what I'm putting a
little more than I'll shoot it but you
see how it just adds a little listen to
it or whatever and it makes it look real
beautiful and natural it doesn't have
that crazy you know that crazy big nappy
look to it cuz sometimes when you get
curly or and you get cruddy
or wavy hair sometimes it's so course
that the natural hair like pro pattern
never comes through because it's so
coarse so this is light it moves when I
moved like it has a situation to it you
know love it again this is one of my 80s
looks she's a maniac so yeah my shorts
on my shorts my school so don't so yeah
other than that yeah I do really love
this hair and texture and I think I
might want to do a giveaway maybe stay
tuned we'll see if there's a giveaway
for this hair well yeah if you love this
hair thumbs up if you don't like it
don't come back I'm just kidding you
know it's on the preference but yeah I
love this I have my Barbie scarf on I'm
not doing a tutorial on this if you ever
ask me to do so and I'm just because
it's a bow it's you know shoes you know
type up so yeah like I said I have in
four bundles and a closure and if you
