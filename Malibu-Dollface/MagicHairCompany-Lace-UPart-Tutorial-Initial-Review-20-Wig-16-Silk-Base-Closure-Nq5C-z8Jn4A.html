you party has combs at the top has four
combs and as you can see there's lace in
this little parting area so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to sew my
closure down to the actual wig and as
you can probably see this is not gonna
fit so we're gonna just pretty much do
the same method but as you can see the
closure is a perfect match is still
based this is the first time I've tried
silk base with magic hair company and I
have to say this is one of my new
favorite closures because it was perfect
it blended with my skin slamed
seamlessly with no concealer
it feels
as you see here I'm trying to make sense
of this because it's just I was trying
to figure out exactly what to do because
I haven't really done this in a long
time but I was like okay it's clearly
it's not gonna fit
so Gitchell eyes so I decided okay you
understand this so it across the table
because it's the tear texture is more
that has actual texture to it which is
not straight it's completely fun and
I've done this plenty of times on
different units that I've made too small
I use nylon sorry because cotton likes
to get really really tangled and yeah
I'm just gonna pretty much so this all
the way around
it
and I'm so gone you got it
I wanna kiss ya
and I'm so gone
so
all right so you guys know lately I've
been wearing a lot of this beautiful big
hair because I think big hair fits me
better than straight hair but I still
love my straight hair you know I just I
love to get my one-in-a-million on so
it's different but it's it's gonna be
for the people who are lazy like me or
just not very well-versed in sewing and
you just want something that's still
pretty and still kind of to the point
but it's a little different so I think
this will be for you guys
so this hair that I'm having right now
is a deep wave and it is a 20 inch lacy
you part
so that means I'm sure if you guys seen
the beginning of this video that means
there's a section like a slither of hair
that's not there and has lace around it
and you pretty much cut that out and
then you pull your hair out in order for
it to blend I however did not do that I
actually had a closure coming because
the thing is every time I go to magic
hair company I never tell her that I'm
coming I just go and to see what she has
and then we pretty much make up my mind
of what I'm gonna do on the spot so she
had this one / so I was like do you have
any you parts you guys know a while back
this was last year sometime yeah cuz
Jenna's video yeah it was like last year
sometime I had a lacy part from her and
I left my leave out and it was a side
part and I had these in this nice height
right here and it was very Jessica
Rabbit a lot of people loved that hair
to this very day I'm still getting like
screenshots and my DMS and stuff about
how I did my hair like that and what how
many bundles that was intact all
actuality that was a that was a lace to
you part
and what lacy parts are which you should
have seen in the beginning of this video
is they're like having like four it's
like between three and four bundles of
actual wefted hair it imagine that but
it's all put on a lace wig but the only
difference is it's left out in a section
so that you can leave your hair out and
it lays really really flat you can put
your hair in a ponytail you can put your
hair in a bun you can do a lot more with
this thing you can't that you can't do
with a like a regular new part that you
were build or someone will make you
yourself
this hair that I have in right now is
deep body wave is 20 inches and I have a
16 inch 4 by 4 4 by 4 silk based closure
so what I did was most of the time when
you get lace you parts it's a long the
section is long but it's very narrow so
you can't really get a closure to sit
cuz you leak closures are four by four
so to try to get it to stay on is it's
not gonna fit in that little bitty area
so what I did was a technique I call the
layover
I guess you can call it and pretty much
you lay the hair over the section where
it's gonna lay and you still sew it down
you're gonna sell over hair but you're
still sew it down and as you can see
that works out great for me because
everything still lays very flat it's a
great method to use when you're using
curly or wavy hair it works for straight
hair as well but I'm just not a fan of
it on straight hair because sometimes
you can still see the gap because
everything is so laid in really really
straight sometimes you can still see it
a little bit and that's just the
perfectionist in me I just don't like
for it to be that noticeable but if you
want to triad you can if you have like a
Lacey you party you brought one and you
have an actual closure laying around you
want to see how it works you could try
it I just installed this hair so I would
have to come back and do like this is
kind of like my initial review and in
the beginning of this was kind of like a
tutorial but I just installed this hair
today so this hair is actually very
fresh as you seen in the video before
this I just took it out the box so it's
very new I haven't put any products in
it um I don't want to put any product
any because I when I get big hair I like
to keep it like this
I do not straighten my big hair I leave
it like this because I feel like I
brought my big hair to where big and I
used to be one of those people like if
I'm gonna spin an extra amount of money
then I should be able to straighten
curly hair or whatever but now because I
have so many wigs and so many new parts
and weaves and all a everything just has
a purpose so my much right here is
foremost right here am I you know curly
hair is former earlier you know it's
from our curly moments so it just really
depends but this I want to get up closer
you guys can see the texture it's a very
natural texture like this hair is super
natural is this is what some of my
friends who are mixed or
their hair looks like this on a regular
basis and it blends so great I just put
some edge control and I wanted to point
this out too because a lot of you guys
ask me like what edge control do you use
like what is your favorite this is the
only edge control that I use and this is
the silk element straight edges this
stuff works for me like a charm
I posted it on Instagram because a lot
of people were wondering what I use I
use that on straight hair I use it on
curly hair you know it's just it works
and it keeps my edges laid and tamed but
it doesn't keep my hair like very like
um I pressed my hair first I press my
edges first and then I put this on so I
don't have a relaxer or a perm or
anything I just pressed my edges really
really good and it just keeps it down
and it keep it doesn't get like white
and it doesn't get like stupid like
other you know other hedge controls I'm
just I'm not a friend of fan of Hick's
I'm not a fan of design that's the only
one that really that and gots to be
glued or the only thing they gonna keep
my edges down because my hair is really
thick but it worked great and it you
know it flows very like look at the part
you can't even tell see that's what I'm
talking why there's a little dirty so
you know but yeah so yeah I love this
hair so far and I know you guys thinking
like every time you do a review you love
to hear because I don't review nothing
that I really don't like if I don't like
it it just goes back the closure is so
let it blend so seamlessly with this
hair though like this is the perfect
thing and I just finger comb did I will
say something about this hair though
it's very light and airy it's not like
my other hair that I had where it was
very full but it was it has some weight
on it this is very very airy and you can
tell by looking at it it just moves it
is soft and like that and that comes
from the fact that there are no wefts
it's just everything is on a lace your
part so that's the good thing about this
and the thing that I love is that it
kind of eliminates the extra bulk in the
way that you would get from the West and
you will get from doubling the webs and
you will get from actually sewing it the
extra thread it's you know that's some
ounces too so yeah I love this I'm gonna
come back with a full blown review on
this but I just wanted to kind of
you guys Hey look at this beforehand I
had a little bit of shedding when I was
combing through it but it seems to have
stopped and now it's not it wasn't
horrible because it was horrible but no
it's it's curly hair and when you have
curly hair like say I got like one
strand that you can't see um that oh
yeah when you have curly hair you
usually run into a nice amount of
shedding dependant but if you could do a
deep condition on it to kind of get it
out then you'll see but I'm gonna leave
this hair like this I'm not gonna put
any product in it because if you want
your hair to stay like this then you
will one not to weigh it down with any
product water and a little bit of
leave-in conditioner will actually go up
very very far but I hope that you guys
enjoy this and learn something from the
earlier part of this video of me
actually installing is so yeah I'll be
back in another three weeks I'm gonna
wear this hair on and off like I've been
doing my other here I've been pretty
much fluctuating all my wigs that I've
been doing recently just everyday I'm
doing like straight hair curly hair wavy
hair body wave hair to kind of just give
everything a chance to see if I really
really like it and I'm finger combing
very hard and I'm brushing very hard to
kind of see if I really really like it
and so far so good for everything
nothing is giving me a significant issue
at all and like I said I just put this
in so you know it's fresh so it looks
great now but we're gonna see what it
does in another three weeks so while I
was down there she has some great news
that I wanted to share with y'all is
well she also has no credit check
financing now so if you are trying to
get some new hair and you happen to be
in an LA area
definitely go visit her I'll put all the
information to the store below and she
has a lot of in-store deals as well that
I wanted to tell you guys about because
sometimes online deals are great but if
you go into the store as chances are you
can get a way better deal when you're
face to face with a person so in order
to get the no credit check financing you
just need a valid ID or proof of income
and of witty check and you're pretty
much good to go on Monday she has $25
off clipping bundles so if you are a
clip in person and you're looking for
like a full head go on Monday because
$25 off clippings is
a nice amount of money trust me on
Tuesdays it's 15% off for lace wigs so
yeah that would be everything 15% off is
a lot when you're dealing with hundreds
of dollars worth of hair these discounts
make a difference I hope that you guys
enjoyed this I hope that you guys love
