I figured out everyone know you seen one
I thought oh if you follow me on
Instagram then you know that I tweeted
ok let me just start over if you follow
me on Instagram then you know that I had
uploaded a picture of this hair and you
guys went bananas and this hair is from
one of my favorite companies which is
magic hair company and this is actually
a lace you part
umm let me stop being rude come on phone
there cuz somebody don't get it but this
is the Lacey you part so I only I don't
wear Sullins anymore I only wear you
parts so this was a match made in
freakin heaven so um they had asked me
after I did my Filipino here they had
asked me to review they asked me to pick
something on their site again and I had
a pleasant experience with them last
time so I said of course and someone
actually tweeted me and said have I ever
used at least you part and I said I
didn't you know they existed but it's
one of the best inventions ever because
it's one way less time-consuming than a
typical you part
it's a lace flatter than a regular you
part and also it's not explained it it's
it's less bulky I guess you could say I
mean my you person I try to make them as
flat as I possibly can but when you try
to put five bundles of hair on a cap and
your head is not that big that tends to
be a sort of kind of like a problem um
so what I did was I have my hair stylist
um just so me I mean you saw me braid me
um a beehive not the typical two that I
usually do or whatever I didn't get one
of those I just had a little be starting
them back and then just go around and
then leave out this much of my um of my
leave out my hair is dirty right now so
I'm not gonna get all up in a camera
right now but we're gonna just brush one
of those but uh yeah my hair is dirty
because I had I've been
wearing this for like a week and I need
to wash it cuz you guys know I got that
wrong nasty scalp but just just look at
it from the side um yeah it's I want to
say it's 28 or 26 inches but let me know
it's silky its virgin Indian it doesn't
say version any and it just says you
parted silky straight virgin 26 this is
the magic company card
oh but they just came around it and it
came with this net on it I don't know if
I kept the lace usually I'll just throw
it in here and just make this cane you
know the wig was around this way guys
know you've seen my other wigs it's
pretty much like that um so it came with
lace around the entire thing I posted a
picture I probably used it as a screen
cap or a thumbnail for this video but I
pretty much had that I just I just cut
everything off it had combs in it um
which is good for people who do not want
to slow it down
I personally sold it down because I
needed to because of the simple fact
that I planned on to like wearing it and
not taking it off like I have not so I
knew for a fact that I was going to need
to UM I was gonna definitely need to
slow it down but it did come with a comb
in the back like right here it came to
on the side and one in the back I they
were sewn in I took them out because if
I try to keep the combs in and sew it
down it would have been in certain areas
it wouldn't a flexed right and it would
just look stupid so I took those out but
that is an option if you want to and I
I'm glad that they actually put the
combs in as an option they don't take
nothing but five minutes and take out so
okay and you can actually put them back
in if you really wanted to um I haven't
had any shedding with the hair at all I
haven't had any issues with it I did cut
it and I did layer it so it covered my
camera head like so ran out of space
well my bad right on his face but one of
the things that I didn't like that I had
to do was I had to put tracks in it like
I did my open my wig I had to put tracks
in it because it was not full enough for
the length and it was 26 inches and it
was for me it just wasn't thick enough
so I went on and just
like I did just parted it selling some
herring and I actually used some of my
other hair from my you part my Filipino
hair so this still is the same company
it's just a different texture but I just
straightened it and it pretty it just
added some weight to it it added some
you know it just made it feel much
fuller for the look especially with all
this valium I have going on at the top
it made it look a little bit fuller
because if I were to did this and the
hair wasn't as full it would it just not
it wouldn't it gave you your life it
just would've gave you your there so
it's just but other than that though I
have yet to have any issues and that's
why I wanted to wear this hair for a
long enough duration to kind of get it
because you parts and wet the hair are
two different things when it comes down
to how they act especially when it's all
a skew part so like when you throw your
weave in versus having a new part you
get it acts differently because it's on
a cap versus on your head
so I have not got any shedding I haven't
had any issues I haven't experienced
nothing like I will say that magic hair
company they are up quality and I will
say that you know there's a lot of times
out here they'll be like I'll sell you a
bundles of hair for $80 and you like oh
that is a crazy deal but then you get
the hair and instant it's shedding like
a mangy mutt that is an issue so I have
never had an issue with their hair for
this one or the other hair that I
reviewed for and I also wanted to say
that magic hair company is located in
California I know that I don't know
exactly I think they're in Sacramento at
the moment however they are opening a
flagship store here in Los Angeles
whoa in Culver City so if you're in the
Inglewood Inglewood LA downtown heart
thorn Gardena esque Westchester area
then you can there I think they have an
opening at the end of the month so they
actually have a store so if you don't
want to wait for your hair if you feel
like you want to go down to the store I
kind of get a feel for it and you are in
the area I'm believe that that would be
an option for you to go down here and
actually
to somebody to kind of get it and not
kind of be surprised that it's or no
regardless of what I say because the
thing is when I review for companies I
try to give my honest opinion as best as
possible but no matter how hard I
describe but some hair or what the
texture might possibly be or what it
will be or what it feels like it's
nothing like filling it for yourself so
if you do have that option to actually
go to the store and play with the hair
look at it see how flat honestly I how
curly it actually is then I think you
should take that option so yeah I think
that's pretty much about it I love this
um I will be keeping this is going to be
one of my keepsakes because I love my
new parts I really do but a lacy part is
much flatter like it is somebody would
just feel this and unless they felt real
hard it can feel my braids but if you
just kind of do want to do use my oh yes
pretty you would just think that it was
all mines
so that's the one thing I liked about
like I love about it forget like I love
about it because um it curls great that
I have to say it did crowed the first
day I curled it it did not hold a curl
very well and these crews have been in
all day like literally all day and they
have held they Johnny dropped this much
so it does hold a very good curl I was
gonna wear straight but then after I had
got all of this volume up here in the
front there is a picture of Illya where
she is like sitting on like a sofa and
she had on some red lipstick some
glasses and her hair looks like this
well it's down on this side too or it
might actually be like this I'm not sure
but that was my inspiration for this
particular hair it was probably
something else and then it went this way
and I was happy with this way um but I
hope that you guys enjoyed this and if
you guys have any questions about it let
me know and I will be more than happy to
answer and follow me on Instagram and
Twitter which is Malibu doll face for
people who keep asking and then also
follow magic hair company on Twitter and
Instagram which is magic haircut and I
will talk to y'all little peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
