for this hair that I'm okay
this hair is the Filipino hair from
magic hair company they contacted me to
do review I've been on a hair wig review
role you know lately so they did contact
me and I'm very familiar with magic hair
company cuz unknownst to myself they
follow me on Twitter and Instagram
before I even problems them like they I
don't know when they follow me but they
had been following me so I was like okay
cool so I received been here about two
weeks ago and it came right in the world
winner of everything in my life going
like everywhere on top of the fact that
Grand Theft Auto 5 came out so it was
just like oh my god you know I am a game
radical a games you know the same but um
this hair was sent in this package and
package opens like such um each piece
each hair each bundle of hair I got four
bundles
which honestly I did not need four
bundles I thought I was but I'll get to
that in a second but each bundle came
with a tag like search with magic hair
company on this side and it has what
kind of hair the length and what texture
now I got four bundles I got a - 26 or
24 and 22 they also sent me a closure
that came in this smaller box the only
reason why I didn't wear the closure the
time I run is because my braids are so
old you guys and I know for a fact that
if I would have tried to put the closure
on with those old braids it wouldn't
have it would have been cute you know so
I decided to do with this because I'm
going I love this hair like it's you
guys know I like full hair and I like
thick hair and this is like the perfect
in-between but this is a this is the
closure that they sent with it and I
thought the closure was gonna be wider
so I was going to be able to put it on
those two braids but it wasn't wide
enough for me to do
so I undertaken those brains out anyway
because they were old that's why I liked
not sewing my I'll show you guys my
braid pattern when I get my hair redone
but I'm not gonna show these on your
braids because it's just not cute but
this is the lace closure so you guys
know I've had issues with like lace
closures before however I'm going to
give this one a chance and see what it
does for me when I reinstall this hair
this is on au part I did the you part
like two weeks ago before Brenda fado
high even came out but I've been in the
midst of that I got a new computer like
it's just been a lot I've been doing a
lot of press and stuff like that for a
little underground stuff that I'm doing
so you don't and stuff like that so yeah
these are all the tags from the hairs
when I got it it came with this magic
hair company card and it also came with
an instruction guide explain how to co
wash wash Tips &amp;amp; Tricks just a little
stuff like that about your install like
just little smart things that you should
know if you were buying virgin hair for
the very first time then you know and it
also has some of your favorite youtubers
in the inside like Ivy and I'm the
infamous peak meals fabulosity is me oh
and my girl Lakia star which is like my
wheezes oliver so yeah we have like you
know all the same interest so that's why
me her get along so very well but they
do show you like a lot of examples of
what the hair actually looks like and
when you receive it and how I can look
all they have April so you know it's
just I have to say because I'm so used
to have an Indian hair to have this hair
in is a little like when I first got it
I was running my finger spoon and I was
just like oh god you know which made me
scared a little bit because I'm like
okay you just got four bundles of this
and you're it's thick you know I'm
saying which point of the bundles is to
make it thicker because you got longer
bundles I got 26 inches you know so this
is how long it comes on me and I did
layer it a little
well a lot of it because I think there's
a lot off but you know it is my top my
actual real hair up here is brown so if
you see a little bit of brown it comes
in a natural black but this you know up
here is a little bit Brown the back here
you know it's all pretty much it's a
mixture it's like brown on top black on
the bottom as you can see but the
texture is nice like I love the texture
to death like this is my goal to I want
to have these curls because you know
thick hair is really great when you're
curling and you want big hair but you
want it to still have weight to it this
is like the perfect hair so I haven't
done that yet because I just literally
and finished just finished installing
this air so it's still really fresh so
it'll like much better tomorrow when I'm
you know wrap it at tonight and all that
good stuff but when I put my closure on
I will come back but this is the
Filipino hair this is in 20 to 26 or 24
and 22 honestly if you're trying to get
this particular look that I have for
bundles is not necessary you could get
away with two and a half bundles because
his hair so full but if you do want that
extra pump just beware at the fact that
it is thick you know and the thicker
your hair the more you're gonna get any
snags you know in the back which I don't
get much because I did cut it and I did
layer it some so it's not as thick as it
was initially and when I did install it
on the you part when I did cut my webs
it did shed and it shed it quite a bit
it doesn't shed now like I can do this
and I get no strands but when I
initially could which I mean it happens
you know but I've never experienced that
with any other hair that I've had but
it's a first time for everything and the
hair isn't shitty now and I haven't
co-wash it or anything it's just this is
how it is and it's I'm not getting any
shade so it's just probably because I
you know cut some air or whatever the
situation may have been but it's nice
you guys like if you want an alternative
from Indian and you want to try a
different texture but you want like
something similar
this is perfect because a lot of times
with Indian here we have to buy so much
of it because it's so fine to get a look
like this
I mean it's poor like it is heavy and
not heavy like oh my God my neck but
it's heavy like when you throw it it
gives you what you need type of heavy
that's their type of heavy it is so it's
not it's like it's really nice I love
this here like and I've been getting
lucky because I'm yet to run let me shut
up no more you never I don't want to
jinx myself but nothing reviewing here
in wigs and so I haven't ran into
anything that's just been like oh my god
you know I've been getting really good
people and really good vendors or people
who were really good vendors like as you
say um but yeah I love this hair and I
know a lot of companies are hitting me
up and a lot of people watching me up
like you know do you want to review in
that's great
just give me a second to guys because
you know I think I only have one head
you know I can only do so much in but
I'll get to you eventually but I do want
to thank everybody over there at magic
hair company for sending me this
beautiful exotic hair because this is
definitely going into my my goes to pile
of hair there are wigs that I really
really really like again it's one of you
part and I fed every piece of hair that
they gave me on this cap so all for
about those feet
I made them fake and it's not bulky it's
not thick it's not big it's not you know
any of that is still laid it's still how
it's supposed to be it's still it's
still giving what I need you know so if
you have any questions regarding this
hair let me know and I'll be more than
happy to answer them for you and head

have a lot of stuff and I've never tried
Brazilian air before I've installed it
from other people but I personally never
