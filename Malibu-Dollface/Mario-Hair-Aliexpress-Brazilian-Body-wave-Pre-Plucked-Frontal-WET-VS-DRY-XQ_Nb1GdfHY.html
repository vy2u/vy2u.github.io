will say this I think this is like my
best install that I've done on the front
tool yet again practice does make
perfect cuz look at God
all right now oh okay so this hair
doesn't like to move when my head says
um it's from Mario hair just look like
yes I don't know who this is but her her
retouching is nice um so this hair is
the body wave yelling on specials um
it's the Brazilian body wave from
Mario's hair and I have four bundles of
24-inch and then I have a 20-inch
frontal as you can see in the front like
right here it's way less curly than it
is back here like whoa body wave ish you
see the difference um
so of course you guys know I went ahead
and bleached my frontal to make sure
that it was gonna blend here in the
front and it goes all the way around
please laying down some money so if I
want to just bust one of these I can but
I don't um and of course it's there all
the way down the side cuz you know hello
my parliament sorry although I've been
switching it up with the part putting it
on this side but not just wanna see okay
so yeah I got it kind of like stuck on
this side cuz this is what I'm just used
to okay so it's body wave you guys know
body wave is pretty much standard it's
all the same for the most part I didn't
get any major shedding from my bundles
but I did my frontal got kind of thin on
me but it is kind of on the thin side
when I first got it it was really full
but then after I bleached it and then I
rinsed it just seems like it's a little
bit more on the
you a thinner side which it doesn't
necessarily bother me crazy
only because because I know if I ever
want a flutter in his hair that it will
be like super straight like it's gonna
go really flat um so that's the great
thing that I will say about this
although I didn't intend on
straightening his hair at all um it
stays straight for a little bit but it
does it kind of looks like this like
after you straighten it for a little bit
in any kind of reverse back it starts to
look more like this and less like this
here in the back now I don't know why
it's two different textures because what
is starting to look like now is it looks
really natural it's just like this is my
natural hair and you know but the back
is still have this nice wave in it and I
wash them with the same thing I let them
air dry the same and I still don't
necessarily know why per say um I'm
getting the difference in texture uh but
it just seems like I straighten the
front which I did like a little bit of
just to kind of like do a strand test
but I do all of this but it's just
really poofy like see I want it to be
like back like Jesus and it's not so
what I'm probably going to end up asking
to do is wetting it all at the same time
and putting some crow cream in it only
because it seems like it's not going to
just automatically go back to it which I
was hoping it would do but it didn't and
a lot of times when you get in here with
texture in it of any sorts this is
usually what happens you end up with two
different types of texture which
normally I don't mind only because if I
want to manipulate the hair in some type
of way then it will be okay so what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna throw some water
on this real quick and I'm gonna come
back and see if everything starts to
want to blend together so let's just see
okay so this is what it looks like after
I put some water in it so you see how it
goes back to its natural state after you
put a little water in it
see now my hair is just much flatter now
which I'm not the biggest fan of
like my hair to be a little bit on the
big side like I like to poop I like the
valium um but if this I didn't put any
um crow cream and I just only put water
so when it dries gonna dry like this
it's not going to get big unless I start
to run my fingers through it then it of
course it's gonna get bigger so yeah
that's the only thing that I always tell
people expressing a body wave they'd be
like ok with my hair cane when it came
in came in this beautiful S shape then I
worried that I washed it and now it's a
little more on the looser side and I
just was gonna happen
like I told you if you do want the dough
the way that it looked when you first
received it then take your flexi rods
while it's wet let them air dry around
the folks you're on take them on they're
gonna have this this S shaped pattern
again um but my hair is most likely is
gonna dry a little bit droopy just
because I still have it Owen as far as
my bundles are concerned um one of my
bundles were a little inconsistent with
the rest and I'm sure you can tell like
this back here it was the one in my very
first bundle cuz they were I was 424 but
one of my 24 is the the weft was like
crooked like it was spun around so when
I was sawing it in I had to like really
make sure that it was laid down because
it was rap I don't know why it was
wrapped around it was the same density
as the rest of the left it still had the
same look at the as the rest of the webs
it just wasn't um uniformed like it
should have been that's the only thing
it was no shedding on as far as my
bundles are concerned nothing abnormally
crazy because I did cut them so I do get
like a little bit when I first started
but again like I told you guys after you
wear it at least after a day um because
what you're trying to do is when you do
cut your west on you're gonna lose some
hair so that's why I always tell people
like soon as you finish making your wig
or getting your hair installed before
you style it or anything
run your fingers through it a whole
bunch of times and eventually all of the
the extra hair that you cut out that
maybe been snagged cut when you was
installing it was that will come out so
that's normal but after that if you
continue to have those issues then it's
not that is just shedding really bad or
it may be shed it's very minimal but
after I went ahead and cut my hair and
ran my fingers
so that's why I'm like I do this and I
don't have any strands because you know
boom none so that's the upside about it
now a besides what I don't necessarily
like it as far as the the closure being
a little more thinner than I would like
I just don't like the fact that it says
I believe this is a 13 by 4 frontal I
say closure frontal but I still don't
feel like it goes as far back as my
other frontal skull
this one feels like it's a little bit
shorter in the crown area it where it
should be the longest I just did a video
where I had a middle part and I told you
I can do my far back middle part with
this hair I can do a middle part but
it's not as long as that one and I know
for a fact that one was a 13 by 4 so I
don't know like I'm still kind of hung
up on the fence with this I'm not crazy
about it cuz there's nothing different
than I what I've had before but I'm
definitely not hating it because I do
love to install that I did do on it and
I feel like it's very natural especially
here and the hairline because as of
lately I don't know what it is with
girls but I be seeing all of these
hairstylist that post their clients and
no shade to nobody like I know I usually
say you gotta say don't show your shade
but I'm really not whatever your client
requests that's what you're supposed to
do as a you know as a hair stylist but
the baby hairs I'll be seeing like
people just be having the it looked like
Brandis Barbie around here and that's
not even saying much like it's like this
literally I have no baby hair out in
here in the front everything that I have
here in the front is just a
natural-looking
frontal you know I don't want a crazy
amount of baby here that's just out cuz
it just looks like that's when people
see a neighbor like oh you can't even
tell I got on a frontal not only can I
tell you got on the frontal ground shake
I'm seeing however installed it they
know what they was doing because they
put all that baby here to hide that lace
listen listen
so yeah I'm still on the fence if I give
it a 1 from a 1 to a 10 the Mario hairs
gonna they're gonna end up getting at
least I want to say like a six and a
half seven that and our reason wise is
between right there because I'm still
not hating it but I'm definitely not
loving it and I don't like the fact that
my frontal was a little thinner than I
would have liked um it to be and I don't
like the fact that my part in space is
only like I have to do a curved part
which I usually do but I wanted my part
to be like right here at least right
here but on track start right there so I
don't think this is a 13 by 4
personally I don't um overall the hair
is really nice you know like the hair
itself is really nice so I'll pull it
all forward so you could see and I'm
definitely gonna put this in my on my
wig sale only because I have so many
units that look like this you know it's
very similar to what I have had before
so I don't know I don't know what do you
guys think I give you a close-up well of
what the hair looks like so this is just
a little bit of water I didn't go water
crazy but you know just a little bit
sort could give a little rejuvenation
but do you guys like yeah yeah put down
if you're interested in this cuz I
definitely will put this one in yours I
have so I mean like the amount of body
weight that I found is very ridiculous
so let me know if you guys are
interested in this let me know if you
like this and let me know how you guys
feel about the whole of crazy amounts of
baby here on people's front school's as
of lately because most frontals do come
with baby here this one came with
Biggers it's very sparse around the
front but it's not crazy sometimes they
almost look like bangs or Omarion when
he was in b2k in the lineup it starts to
look like our Holly from Dance Moms um
it starts to look a little crazy up in
the root area and then people got all of
this hair this is part of the frontal
this baby hair piece is rather part of
the frontal
this is the frontal only thing that's
out that is minds is palpable yeah
nothing all I say a little piece but not
put it back so yeah everything that I
have in the front here is the frontal
it's not crazy so I don't understand why
people are drizzling baby hair down
people's faces trying for the general
public to believe that this is your
natural hair texture because it's so
large so let me know what you guys think
let me know if you
are interested in this week let me know
do you like body wave over straight
because that's you that's been the big
comparison body wavers straight because
right away we'll curl back up but you
can also wear it straight and it's not
gone it's easier to straighten this hair
than it is like curly here so let me
know let me know and I will catch y'all
in next one hey peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
