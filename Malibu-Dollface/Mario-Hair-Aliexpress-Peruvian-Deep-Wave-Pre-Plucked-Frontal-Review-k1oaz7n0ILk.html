means you're gonna get took it out so
pass the peas and let me fix your plate
so let me see you shake that O'Day so I
can swing my boots yo I start sniffing
like mr. snuffleupagus look a little
familiar I know right um so this hair is
from Mario hair and this is their
Peruvian deep wave so I have in four
bundles and I have a pre plucked frontal
oh it's a lot going on in my head right
now I have a pre plugged frontal so
let's get to the hair I believe that I'm
wearing I do not recall what my limits
are it's been a minute people but I
believe I'm wearing 224 and 222 if I'm
not mistaken I always do this if I can't
remember wherever it falls is used I
continue but this foot is a moment
certain 224 and I believe I got 222 as
well or I could have four twenty fours
might have four twenty fourth listen we
about two inches off depending now our
front tool I believe is a 16 inch um
frontal so it goes all the way on the
side here and all the way on this side
is a well and I will say I had this
style before but it wasn't as tight like
up in here and it slipped as I would
have liked because at the time like I
got like I told you guys it was so weird
and with a closure to that did not help
it was a closure as well so to my hair I
could watch this hair four times and I
do the message that I love all so much
where I dry it upside down so that it
can go back and spring back like it's
supposed to because what ends up
happening is a lot of times when you
have curly hair which even I've seen a
lot of times on other girls
um when I've seen some of my fellow
gurus their hair starts to it kind of
pulls it looks like this so to avoid
that what you do is you wash your hair
and why it's wet you Eve you leave it on
doe cap don't cap and you
just prop it upside down you just take
it you I put pins into a Styrofoam head
and I just prop it upside down I'll let
it sit on if this is going to be
straight then I'll let it sit cos it's
gonna dry flat but it will keep the
curls from springing like such and then
it will keep them gravity won't do what
it does that's what I'm trying to say
gravity will not pull your curls down
okay
now to the actual hair let's start with
the shedding the shedding has been
minimal to none and I guess probably
because I did the photo over method for
this entire wig I did not cut anything
so the shedding was really towards the
end so when I would pull through like
this I would probably get a strand or
two but now that I'm Co washed and worn
it and laid on it and rewashed it and I
actually went go-cart racing with this
puppy home and it looked real cute even
though I put my helmet on and I had to
pull this back and I put my helmet on it
got a little smooch but it propped back
and just a little bit in here it's a
little frizzy just a little bit see then
that I don't experience high volumes of
shedding my hair is still very full
which is great because a lot of times
after a while it will be a mess now what
I will say is this back piece right here
I have to make sure I comb out see I
could do this I couldn't do that if I
was just like wearing it taking it off
wearing it taking off I have a tendency
and sometimes it's not even the whole
wig but up after that day of it being a
little hot a lot of hot look a little a
lot of hot um I definitely came home and
I only co-wash just the bottom like
section so probably much what a bundle
would be I just did that because that's
where most of my I won't call it Maddie
and i'ma call it tangling because if it
was matted this would be a short wig
this yeah so I have to make sure that I
do this and this is not with just this
hair this is any curly hair I've ever
had I have to do this be
if I do not what is going to happen is
I'm going to end up with a mop and it's
going to be a problem so to avoid that
make sure that you're using something
that is hydrating on your hair I can't
stress it enough because it's often I
see people I love my curly hair and then
after about two weeks it mattered on me
and I'm thinking to myself okay so what
did you do so that means what you tell
me is and a to which you didn't wash
your hair and then at that time you
washed it then you put the wrong stuff
in it and it became a problem
I always tell y'all this will save all
of your hair legit I think this whole
bottle like I said before is 5 bucks 5
bucks will go very far in saving your
curly hair your straight hair it smells
great and it does it is conditioner for
moisturizing for dry and damaged hair
any conditioner that is for dry or
damaged hair is always great for your
curly hair ok because it's going to is
made to super hydrate now this is made
for that don't go to get the dollar
suave y'all can't stress the dollar
suave enough because what's going to
happen is you're going to end up with
very dry hair and once your curly hair
and this state starts to dry the next
thing is matting then it's tangling well
its tangling then it's matting and then
it's the trash because it's not going to
last so to avoid that if you can't put
this in it and then run your fingers
through it then you need to let it let
it sit put a little heat to it you could
throw it in the microwave now listen if
you cook your bundles I'm not
responsible put it in there for just
enough so that the heat can hit it and
it's trapped in that bag so that it can
just loosen everything up but be very
mindful of and don't if you have a full
wig like I do do not put it in your too
long because your lace will cook and
then it's going to just Ravel up and
it's going to shrink so don't do that
but be very mindful if you cannot do
that if you are wearing a sewing of some
sorts put this in the back of your hair
and put a shower cap on and sit under
somebody's dryer because guys I have
made the most expensive hair work and
I've made some of the cheap
hair work and it's because I've used the
correct products if you don't know what
to use axe someone but do not just take
it upon yourself wear this until it
turns into a Rick James fro and then get
mad because now there's a bottle of nap
cuz then it's really on you cuz you
worried and you did it and it was
probably some of the worst hair I had I
did not have issues with detangle and to
try to get it to look a manageable
you know look manageable for me even
though I didn't like the hair but I've
seen pictures where it's just a ball of
hair and I can't tell you how long it's
been since I've had that issue when I
didn't know what I was doing when I was
just wearing it sleeping on it doing
whatever in it and then expecting for it
to bounce back that's where I start to
get problems um I know another question
that I'm gonna get from you guys did I
straighten his hair no I didn't I will
not because I don't believe in
straightening my curly hair anymore the
other I mean if you can't afford VOC did
pick one or the other because what's
going to happen is you straighten this
it's going to end up being a body wave
and you're going to be buddy mad and
then your Excuse is going to be my hair
didn't pop back or I had hair from this
company and I straighten it all the time
and it went back every type of hair from
every company is very different so be
mindful of that okay if you got it from
a shaylen's boutique and hers is popping
back cool but if you go and get this and
they don't pop back you can't compare
the two because one in Finnish if
they're both truly version and this does
say I'm process but look at the pattern
people is this is definitely process but
if you go to people I mean if you go to
this end and they're from two different
donors you can't you know I'm saying
hair is it varies and a lot of times
when you are buying hair from you know
virgin hair from the Philippines from
wherever you're most of your bundles are
going to be from very much different
people so they're going to react
differently they're got every girl that
you know got curly hair their curly
pattern is very different so please keep
that in mind the only way that you can
get them to
just to make sure that you definitely
the company is doing they're supposed to
do to make sure their bundles match when
they send them out that's their job it's
not your job you receive bundles and
this one is a loose wave this is a body
wave and this is the ocean wave this end
I'm all back and get your money back so
you won't be in a big wave of a nap
because that's not what you want um but
overall as far as this hair goes I
haven't had any major issues other than
the little snagging that I'm getting in
the back and that's just normal because
it's quite hot in the valley and I
really don't like to wear straight here
when it's SuperDuper hot because I just
feel like I got a whole blanket laying
on my face so this definitely helps to
just kind of go with the flow
have fun look cute and ending summer on
a good note so yeah it still looks good
though it still popped back you guys
know I love my glorying food cheese curl
calm down because it definitely calms it
down so I don't have so my hair doesn't
look like this so it just doesn't look
like this you know you don't want to
like a tree but too often on Instagram I
see girls looking like trees that's not
what you want you want to still look
cute but not overgrown like this so make
sure you guys check out Mario's here for
this particular hair if you guys are
interested in any curly hair I do have
some other curling her that I am working
on right now um that I think you guys
are really going to get a little bit
different um still on the search for a
frontal that is not straight at the
roots although I will say for this one
it was a lot less straight like it was
only probably the roots that was
straight and then it got curly as
opposed to most of it being straight and
then the straightness usually starts
about here so you got to make sure that
your ponytail is left eye high and make
sure it look like this so yeah um it's
all I got to say um but what I will do
um this one will be added to my wig tail
when it when I start my wig sales so if
you're looking for some curly hair and
you really like this one then just hang
on no listen people I ain't got time but
he would tell me I got a whole
- the first whenever it goes up isn't
one is priscila q miss it you snooze you
lose all I got late so I would catch
y'all in my next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
