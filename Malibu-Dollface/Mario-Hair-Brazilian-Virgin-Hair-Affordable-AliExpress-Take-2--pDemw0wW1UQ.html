review which is for the hair that I'm
wearing and this from a new okay so you
guys know I had a review go up for and
Aliexpress company and every didn't work
out so I decided to give it another shot
with a different community just kind of
see you know if it's just that or
whatever the situation is and I will say
so far so good
I've had this hair for a week and a half
and it's nice it's not is here's the
it's a body wave and it's a three piece
and it also came with a matching closure
as well this is a lace closure that I
haven't I opted for no part with this
one only because I just don't like the
way that lace looks when you party it
just doesn't look natural this is the
Brazilian body wave as well as the lace
closure to match um the exact texture
this texture is really nice it's like
everything that you see right here and
all up in here all of this is Holly Kane
for the last week and a half I've been
wearing his hair to run my errands I put
it in like a high bun because I went
running with my friend so I was like all
cowboys here this is kind of see
attested and it was really hot and the
only thing that I've done since then is
I co washed in here because it did get a
little sweaty and I don't like the way
that my hair smells after I've been out
in the Sun all day like I just don't
smell the best so I went ahead and Co
washed it and this is how it is so other
than a co-wash I haven't did anything
this is the natural texture of it I've
had a little shedding but nothing always
say not anything that isn't straight
usually is going to shed it's just it's
inevitable you know um I having three
bundles which is very unusual from you
guys know I'm a 5 bundle or more type of
individual however I think that the
practical people in the world that are
not me um do like to wear you know just
very natural looking bundles Oh
uh these bundles will work for anybody
who you know you you're not a person
that likes really thick big hair um this
will be more of a natural style I've had
to style a lot of times but I've always
done it where I had like like 85 bundles
in okay having a 22 or 24 and a 26 and I
also have in a 16 inch lace closure this
hair was very easy to install
um one thing that I did notice about
this hair that I don't notice on a lot
of other hair is that this hair had no
beards on the actual West and the weft
were very greatly constructed so that
you know webs are just is as important
as the hair that they're putting on the
West because if ever your hair starts to
shed 90% of that comes from the fact
that it was poorly constructed to start
off with so be mindful of that look at
your when you buy hair always look at
your lips if the webs are crooked put
two tracks together and they'll sew them
together to make a thicker weft but
sometimes people just split their lips
but you see that more and pack hair than
you do in virgin hair so um we also keep
that in mind always look at your lips
because it's going to let you know so if
you ever buy hair and you think you like
I don't really know how the quality of
this hair is going to be before you even
put it in look at the West if the web
slip jacked up don't do it because it's
going to make the situation worse and
nine times out of 10 when you buy hair
and you already install the hair or you
wash it are you lint you manipulated in
any way shape or form the company is not
so forgiving about taking the hair back
because you have already altered it and
they don't know what you did to it so um
this hair it didn't give me any problems
or when I co washed it and was no issues
um again I got a little bit of shedding
when I did cohosh it I've been wearing
this hair non-stop for the past after I
did my other wig then I've been wearing
this because I still like the same like
flowy style that it has but I just
didn't want it as tighten as big I
didn't want it to be a little more
uniform so I decided to go with this
um but yeah this is our Mario's hair is
a new Aliexpress company um they have
currently concerning um store on how to
express they have 30%
so with these three bundles and the 31
percent discount that they're giving
right now that would make all three of
these bundles would be 158 I think 14 or
something like that which is great
because that's like I know someone
bundle that cost that much
so you're new the hair you're not really
sure if you want to just try something
out but you don't want to really break
your bank to do so this would actually
be very perfect for you because it's
very difficult to get three bundles of
under $200 and the closure so put the
link to that below because I'm not
really sure about what the closure price
is but I know it's not that much so if
you're just starting out you don't want
to break the bank you just want some
hair to try to you know try it out and
you kind of tight at the packing or then
I would have to give them a try um I
personally haven't had any major issues
with my hair I brushed it I've combed it
ivko washed it I pulled it I put it in a
bun I've let it sit in the Sun all these
all those things or whatever so make
sure that you guys check out Mario hair
I'll put all the links to these three
bundles as well as the UM the closure
below and I think for myself just like
on some personal stuff I'm gonna buy I
think they're twenty I think it's a
twenty-eight a twenty-eight thirty and I
think a 34 I forgot whatever their
highest one is I think imma buy for
myself
just because I want to try something but
I don't want to do it on a really
SuperDuper expensive hair so imma try it
and i'ma let y'all know exactly how I
thought about that as well I'm gonna get
some straight hair though I'm not gonna
do up this body wave but this is
definitely their Brazilian body wave um
smells nice when I first got it it
didn't have that infamous Aliexpress um
corn chip smell that everybody complains
about but need it in my other hair um so
yeah I'll put everything below and I'll
talk to you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
