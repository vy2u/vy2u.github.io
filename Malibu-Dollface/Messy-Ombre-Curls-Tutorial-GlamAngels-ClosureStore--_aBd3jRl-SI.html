can tell by the bottoms I have added
some color at the bottom with some bring
horrible bleach that made my hair so dry
but um it wasn't the hair that got dry
it wasn't the reason why I got dry is
because of the bleach I use them all hot
topics bleach that I got to buy one get
one free didn't matter
but anyway um this is pretty much my
signature hairstyle that I always wear
which is usually a little a little
height right here and then the rest of
this you know is curled inward there's
not too Stella had in my last video but
it was inspired by a style that I had
before and that's that before this is
the steps that I took so you're just
gonna need a paddle brush of any sort a
curling iron and some type of holding
spray if you want to I'm not gonna use
any because I already have some in my
hair so I'm just gonna leave it what it
is so yeah I'm gonna do voiceovers cuz
if I'll walk through this it's gonna
take it's hardly too long so yeah enjoy
so okay here we're gonna just put a
roller we're gonna curl it and put a
roller at the top because this is where
most of the valium is gonna be it's not
gonna be really high but we just want it
to have a little bit of body to it so
we're gonna just take the roller we're
gonna put it there and leave it there
and we're gonna do that first so that he
pulls off completely by the time we
finish this this part we're gonna just
go around the entire
and we're gonna curl everything towards
the face and this is pretty much gonna
give the hair a nice bouncy fluffy look
at the bottom or whatever and it pretty
much helps the hair stay so when it does
drop it still will kind of fold into
itself even when it gets you know big
and fluffy you have those nice Hollywood
curls
okay so here we're gonna just put a
little holding spray just like the vase
estate I'm gonna brush them out but I
still want it to look like I had some
type of curl in it because they're gonna
be very messy it's not gonna be very
structured like how it looks right now
we're gonna just run the brush through
it and run the comb through it and just
kind of put the lid up I guess you could
say just funk it up a little bit but
yeah I like this look it's very easy you
could do this for everyday work or
whatever this closure is still
everything in my opinion this is one of
the best closures if not the blood
special closure I've ever had from the
closure store it's a sub place our
closure and eyes we'll be using them for
a lot of my units that I do not have
closures for yeah so here I'm just
pretty much styling it and kind of
seeing how I like it and you know what
style I want to kind of do with it
so yeah this is pretty much it is very
simple to the point and I hope you guys
enjoyed this and I will see you guys in
the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
