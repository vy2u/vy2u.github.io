when they kiss me one I do
it for the fan I was busy taking trips
with no we just hit the bricks but she
know I'm from New York and now I'm back
in with the don't connect it to me
unless the Commission is the one to play
with
I will comfy in that no but again I'm
diagnosis arrest you try like a ball
pitcher barrettes they can be with that
can afford a project I'm just wish to
keep your britches in yet back in a sec
I ain't busting a sweat yeah but your
sparkly dress cool enough for me but I
love fake yeah oh my feeling right now
okay so I just say how good it feels to
be doing this as opposed to going off
like I don't think y'all understand
isn't therapeutic to me that is true but
in a whole different way
but anyway so to my hair which is from
my Lisa hair on Alex price and grow I've
never done this look before at least not
that I can remember so this is a bit of
Brazilian straight girl get down in a
frying for y'all this is the Brazilian
straight and I have in five bundles of
um 28 inch and I have a hold on let me
check what my front I know my purse was
a 13 by 6 and my friends who is 18 big
ol lot work with was 18 inches girl I
cut baby up so that's why I got all of
this movement going on up in her because
that's where all my laters pretty much
came from now originally I was going to
wear this look with just a regular you
know body wave look that I used the Kim
Kane look can we tell the various things
but I changed it up because I was like
I'll do something I haven't done before
and I wanted to show off my faith in my
voice because y'all know I'm always you
know covering baby up so I had to let
at amount the day so to this actual hair
first off I don't think I can tell
probably not but my frontal is actually
blue if we guys can actually see that
it's blue but I just like I'm very like
a dark indigo blue and you can see a
really good in the Sun I have been 528
and this is what 528 looks like after I
went ahead and chopped it up so this is
how cool it is okay I actually only used
four bundles instead of five I have a
full bundle left so this is houseful of
us with only 400 oh yes now to the
actual weather start with the front so
the frontal I did not glue my frontal
all the way down here in the front I
just brought it behind my ear I only
glued the part here down and you can see
my temper over here because it slipped
back because I didn't do the new message
that I'm trying to about it I'm not
going to do all that just to wear it
like this
is that's a lot of freaking work be
playing what I will say is I really love
it because of how far back it goes so
you can see I got me a nice little cord
- the important one on there girl
it bleached like a dream so oh I took
pictures of it and I was putting the
color on it so you can see that it was
blue and I took it to a almost a 613 and
I went ahead and put the color on it
it's a color very well my frontal gave
me minimal shedding and gave me typical
shedding happening bleach air and get me
that type of shooting but it wasn't
nothing that I was like oh my god it's
going to be bald as you can see my is
really full steal my frontal is not
crazy thin at all because what time what
happen is I was doing a color and I
bleached it and then all the air came
out like if I think I hit up the company
like we're not going to do this because
y'all from fools me I said but they
should have thought out like that legs
girl what you mean like girl listen it
went back I'm not reviewing that but
this hair did not give me those issues
at all it actually was very nice it and
when after I colored it and I flattened
it is
was very nice it still blends with his
hair down here nothing looks different
it all looks like one uni as far as my
bundles were concerned I didn't notice
that there was little to no Shetty with
my bundles they were fine but my front
so I did notice that my frontal for
whatever reason doesn't like to hold a
curl like that and I don't know what the
reason for that is I'm an s-1 another
reason why I opted for different hair so
because it just wasn't seen with all the
hairspray that I was using I was still
it still just didn't want to stay in
this particular style and I use this
hair spray to hold usually when I do
stuff that requires a lot of like height
and voluminous men sometimes I use this
Sebastien brand as well just depending
on what look I'm doing but even with
both of these together my fronts will
just wouldn't want it didn't want to
stay like that and I don't understand as
to why and what reason that is I bleach
the hair so my hair is definitely not
synthetic because it bleach but I just
don't know why it doesn't want a whole
like the actual bundles as you can see
have held their curls now I just took
the rollers I thought they wasn't
enrollee they were pin curls and their
pin curl for a couple hours and that was
it but every time I redo this look I
have to repent curl my hair because if I
don't it will look more like a body wave
as opposed to this type of wave and
y'all know the difference you don't get
this or whatever it was between my
frontal I love the frontal being pre
plucked at all show you a picture here
before actually when it was like fresh
out the box it came free plus it was
very very cool very soft it gave me no
issues other than the fact that it
doesn't want to hold a curl as far as
color and gold great as far as
straightening goes as you can see baby
great but as far as trying to actually
hold a curl that's where I see that it
doesn't thrive so well in that
particular area but Miley bear that's a
minor thing that you guys can fix
because your hair is actually very very
very very much
it's very decent these bundles are still
very soft originally I was going to act
bleached his hair all and do it all blue
but I just not too long ago I did a very
similar look and that was a little too
much work I'm happy I didn't put on
camera you can't even tell that my damn
consoles blue so there you go but yeah
that's all you got to say about this
it's some very comparable hair and for
the prices that they're giving I think
that is actually a really good price for
what you'll be getting with the bundles
and the frontal a lot of you guys have
been asking me about Aliexpress and how
they change a lot of things that they do
as of now I know that every vendor that
on Aliexpress has like a certification
so all of those bad companies who are
sending out bad here got the boot so
that's why you like where did all
companies go all all the companies who
had a long dealing with Aliexpress are
now gone and all of these companies that
I'll be reviewing from this point
forward have to go to a process where
they cannot just open up shots left and
right and on top of that I like that too
because it saves out on the amount of
time for me to see you guys do not
understand this on my head I have to sit
back so I have noticed that this
slowdown up really bad here or companies
hitting me up out of the blue left and
right have kind of slowed down so it's
giving me more time like my my process
for each review I do as a requirement of
three months from when I get it up until
we get to this point so I had to change
that just because I wanted to do some
more quality control so that's what kind
that's why things have kind of seemed
like they slow down because I'm just
taking more time to kind of get to where
I want to be and I will say that my Lisa
hair did a very good job with this just
work on why I don't know why that the
frontal doesn't want to do the same
thing that these BOM bundles want to do
and also Aliexpress one more thing they
do have where you are can only buy from
this point single bundles they don't do
the package deals as of right now for
what I think it could change by time
this videos get up from what I seen in
the right now there is really no like
bungle deals going on so yeah be mindful
of that
but first like I said for the price I
really would like it so if you guys are
interested in this error make sure you
guys hit the links below let me know how
