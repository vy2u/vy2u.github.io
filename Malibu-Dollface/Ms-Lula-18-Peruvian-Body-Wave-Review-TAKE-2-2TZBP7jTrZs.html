inches for bundles of 18-inch Peruvian
um
body wave I got to say are straight but
it's not straight it's Peruvian body
wave and I put a little color I'm a roll
up on you you probably can't tell but
there's color all right in here it's
much browner at the ends than it is
towards the top and I just wanted a
little bit of color but this color I
keep using keep giving me this chocolate
brown color and I was trying to go
lighter you guys know I want my hair to
be red like amber from clueless like I
want like a ginger red color but this
all a color payoff that it pretty much
gave me um and it has less to do with
the hair and more to do with the actual
hair color that I use um but I've had
this hair since September early
September mind you and so far SuperDuper
good um
this hair has been I've curled this here
I don't know how many times and you guys
know I actually guys in one of my videos
do you guys want to see more short
hairstyles because um when I hairstyle
more short hair length then I've been
rocking cuz you guys know I'm good to
rock I'm the super long hair so a lot of
you guys are like yes please because
this is what I pretty much wear to work
this is what is normal to me this is I'm
not into the super long hair so I said
okay well I'm gonna do this same style
that I've done before many of plenty of
times and I think I have a tutorial on
how I cut this hair if I don't have a
tutorial on how to cut some hair um in
this particular style and it curls like
a dream not one issue it curls like a
super duper dream and it also stays on
my pearls do fall they are they're not
our super girls they definitely do fall
after a couple of hours um everything
starts to fall I remember when I first
made the wig I just went ahead and cut
it and then once I cut it I went ahead
and curled it and I did not use these
flexi
that they gave to me because um I didn't
need them I many are actually too small
but I can use these for something else
just not this particular hairstyle it
just wouldn't work with this because
it's just too short um for it these they
need to be a little bit bigger in order
for the curls to come out looking like
this
how many guys it gets you up cola no
there's not much I can do but air is
color at the bottom um well yeah I've
been wearing this here of course on and
off since September and it's now October
and it's still good now I've washed it
here four times
I washed it when I first received it I
washed it after I put the color in it
then I washed it again after I wore it
and then I watched it again before I did
this review so it's pretty it's hit the
water a few times and it still has some
nice beautiful luster in it um I have
not put any of like my sermon in it you
know usually I do but I haven't because
I wanted to see how the natural luster
would be after so many KO washes and in
so many washes only they won't go wash
but the what they wanna wash is that
I've done yeah it should be pretty dull
by now and it's not so that's great so
when you receive your hair um they give
you a 20% coupon a $20 off coupon as you
see here and then they give you haircare
tips as well which I don't believe I
receive and a chance to win a free flat
iron um I do not recall getting I got
this card but this wasn't on the back um
not that I recall back in January so
they could have definitely changed a lot
of their stuff since I'm the West that I
received revered very easy to put the
needle through you guys know I don't not
like tough super hard whips
um cuz you can do nothing with those
after a while they need to be a little
more flexible but they did hold none of
them were split um there were not a lot
of beards of the closure that I received
which is this one the closure is pretty
good I do
enjoy um you guys know I just I'm not
into a lot of lace closures um hey this
is what they sent this is what I use um
you guys know how I feel about my
subways closures I'm just so in love
with them but I am trying to get a
little more back into the lace just a
smidgen because a lot of you guys do
enjoy the lace wigs and the lace
closures everybody is going to still top
so I'm trying to be a person of reason
here you know um but so far really
honestly so good I have not had no
problems with them um business-wise or
hair-wise look how beautiful this hair
curled you know and I've had it for
quite some time and trust me I wear this
look um because I do like the fact that
I will say this this wig is one of the
weeks that I get the most compliments on
because they usually like so long where
can I get some hair like that or who cut
your hair see the layers in this you
know they look more prominent than the
ones in my longer hair because you can
see more of them you know so when it's
longer is just so much that everything
needs to have a place you know so I give
miss a Lula's hair a nice 9 again it's
not perfect by a long shot
um it's not terrible I'm definitely by a
longshot it's actually some very
comfortable hair and it actually is very
nice it's very soft
um the shedding is very minimal it's not
crazy it's not something that you got to
keep picking up hair flow it's not that
at all it's easy to curl it was easy to
color um yeah I don't find anything is
just nothing that is that with it you
know you ever have some hair or
something in your life that is like you
know that's gonna work you know for me
y'all know I like to be like seven
people in one day this is one of those
those leagues where you can just throw
it on and go about your day poplin curls
in it and go it's not you don't need to
do too much and as much as I curled my
curl at 450 degrees okay y'all put that
heat so uh my hair you know you were
thinking
hair burns before that degrees and his
hair did not do that so you guys are
interested um the link will definitely
be below and like I always tell you guys
make sure you guys check out other
reviews before you purchase from any
company to make sure that you're
purchasing your investment is definitely
worth it before you make that leap don't
take my word for it take everybody's
word for it because that's going to be
the determining factor and if you love
versus liking your extensions so shout
out to miss lose hair I'm happy we could
come to a medium a nice happy medium I
love my hair and I will catch you guys
