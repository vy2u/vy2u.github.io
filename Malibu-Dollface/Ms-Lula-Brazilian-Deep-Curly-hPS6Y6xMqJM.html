Venus I'm valedictory y'all in the
morning I've got a 999 vote you got your
hundred and 99 no you go get your where
why can't you see open your eyes I got
you by Lance up y'all next II love
myself
Colgate clown bad bitch ciao catch right
and like it one cook oh my G oh okay
guys so I love this and I don't know
what the hell I did different to my hair
I mean I'm with that too
um but my makeup I don't know what the
hell I did that was different but I've
never been able to be this close to the
camera I feel okay about it okay so okay
so this hair is my brazilian deep curly
from Miss Lula's hair hey guys no at me
and Lula go way back
I've had this hair um I got it at the
end of March and I've had it ever since
you guys noticed that a lot of my March
babies are my wigs
oh they're the reviews are coming out
now because I've waited up thus long to
review this hair now originally they
sent me two bundles of 20 notes this any
four bundles of 22 inch and my frontal
is an 18 inch frontal what I did was I
unbeknownst to miss Lula so I'm sure to
the first time learning about this I had
someone else order me another bump
another two sets of 24 for the bottom
piece
so these 24 bundles were not the
original bundles that were sent to me I
bought these with my own money
just because I wanted to see you guys
know I told you guys I'm trying out a
lot of curly hair as of right now and I
am trying to see like how great it is
but I just want to make sure that the
hair that I'm reviewing is the hair that
you guys are going to receive so has
someone in another state
buy it I paid for it with they paid on
their card so nothing was tracked back
to me from them and they went ahead and
sent me the bundles and as you can see
they match and this hair mind you I
owning all what you guys know I do not
like to post hair that I'm currently
wearing on Instagram or snapchat or
anything but I actually posted this hair
um
and quickly delete it probably like back
in July and people were asking and I
didn't really think of it because I have
another some other hair doll review that
looks very similar to this but it's not
the same and people were asking me like
where is that where is that and I was
like okay hold on not right now because
I'm not finished with this I was still
testing it out and at that time I still
had the 422 s in so I took two bundles
of that out which I still have and I
actually used it for a different way
that I did for someone else so I only
have these in for like I think I had
those two bundles in for about four
months and then I took them out and
replace them with these I simply take a
water bottle like this I put it up you
want to go by percentage it's like hmm
it's about 75% conditioner and about 20%
water because this is curly hair you
want to make sure that you hydrate so
this is what I use the Tresemme
luxurious moisture which is the moisture
rich conditioner this conditioner will
save any hair
this is Aliexpress hair this hair has
definitely been processed it's not
virgin I'm gonna think it says virgin in
the title but it's definitely not
emerging but it's very pretty but what
you have to remember is that when you
get this hair it's going to be when you
go ahead and install it and you're
pulling it apart then it's going to
start to get extremely big so what you
do is usually after is like after I make
my win I'll go ahead and co wash it so I
just throw the whole wig in the sink run
some warm water on it don't put hot
water on it people hot water will tangle
up your wig and this is very kinky hair
so you do not want your your hair
tangled up and it looks amiss because
they are going to be pissed off um so
you don't want that you want to
definitely put it in let it like
saturate all of it and then take a nice
amount of that condition and put it in
your hair once you have saturated and
everything let it sit you can put it in
a plastic bag throw it in the microwave
for about a minute check it don't let it
cook because I
possible for no cooked hair and just
checking that is getting warm keep it
sealed in that back for at least 45
minutes then rinse it out um what it's
going to do is it's going to kind of
make sure that all of the cuticles are
in one direction make sure that all the
hair is nice you run your fingers
through it it's like butter
um because curly hair is very prone to
getting tangled what I do is in between
co washes so when I like for instance I
wear this here today what I'm gonna do
tonight is I'm going to put it on the
mannequin head and tomorrow I'm gonna go
wash it but in between if I were this
hair let's just our three days so I'll
work Monday Tuesday Wednesday on
Wednesday I'm taking a water bottle and
we're gonna go ahead and you know I need
some more water come on now go get some
in here like you know and you're gonna
saturate start from the bottom do not
let up your whole face here and you're
gonna run your fingers through you don't
want your hair to be dripping down your
back that's that's not what we're doing
here and run your fingers do it okay
once you do this then your hair is going
to start to be a little bit more tame
the pulse to how it is so one side of my
hair hasn't had anything on it since
earlier today and the other side does
you see what I'm saying so this right
here you start kind of getting this
where it wants to bunch up a little bit
or just kind of look a little raggedy
take your water bottle and run your
fingers through it and once you run your
fingers it'll all come back so how you
need it see and there you go when I
first got it I definitely did a diffused
curl on it with my blow-dryer
but I found that that didn't necessarily
make a difference because one time I
didn't have the time to do it so I just
set it on a tile and once I finish
washing it I definitely scrunched it up
until all the water was gone I took a
white towel and I blotted it out and
then I made sure that all my curls were
still like this they were not hanging
because this is longer this is this 24
is gonna pull it's gonna do this when
you win a stopping way so in order to
get it
come back and spring back to you what
you want to do is take it and scrunch it
up so that's what I mean like let it dry
upside down which some people don't
understand let it dry upside down
meaning all your curls should be upside
down where their gravity is hitting them
here and they're not pulling this way
once they dry they'll dry like this and
once they dry like this then you should
be fine and this is the natural crow
pattern of what it looks like so I will
say after since March having this hair I
will say I've only run into one problem
with this hair and that was the shedding
in the beginning since then I haven't
had any major shedding every now and
then I'll get it because it is curly
hair I'll get some shedding here and
there but the great thing about this is
because most of us now are wearing wigs
and frontals and stuff like that it's
easier to pull them on and pull them off
I don't even have this one glued down at
all hair is just the baby here that
actually is on the frontal my stocking
cap is just kind of stuck right there um
but other than that the frontal is
really great too and the frontal matches
this matches the hair this frontal
matches the hair perfectly because a lot
of times um baby baby
that's not will be getting around these
parts usually they're too different and
what I've just started to do recently as
a reasoning on my hair because I don't
like for my roots to be crazy straight
is that of you I find if you when the
hair is still stopping away if you put
it on a mannequin head and you party
down the middle you're gonna have a side
part you put it down the middle if you
comb all the hair in that direction once
it dries pull it over and then it'll be
it won't be so flat here at the root and
I have a little bit of valium to it um
if you do it if you want a middle part
then I will part them on both sides and
comb them this way so when you go like
this it will definitely be a nice little
middle part situation going on but this
hair definitely reminds me of Maya's
hair from her first album the moving on
you know this is definitely what this
hair is giving me is giving me clear
from my wife and kids type of tease um
is Lulla hair you guys definitely get a
nice 9.5 from me um because I did I
really do enjoy this hair and after all
this time of having it and I wear this
hair quite often I'm
surprise that it has not going to hell
so if you guys are interested make sure
