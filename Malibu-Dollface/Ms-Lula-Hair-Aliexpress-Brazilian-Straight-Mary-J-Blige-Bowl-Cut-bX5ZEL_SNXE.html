it's not new because I've done it before
so how do you guys like this hi I
personally enjoy this and I think the
reason why I enjoy this is because I'm
not used to it so that could be the
reason like it's not something that I
wear every day or something I wear often
so it's very different but I was
actually watching Wendy Williams and you
know measured works begin the divorce so
that showed this picture of Mary which
I'll put it here and Mary had she been
wearing this for the longest and on a
cover which I think on Friday her album
comes out which is called
the strength of a woman so a girl Marius
hurt him and I think that I was gonna be
really good but she had like this much
lung cut that she's been wearing for I
was the last couple of years and she
wears it obviously in her signature you
know blonde colors very honey blondish
what some 613 highlights here there
depending on which look she got going on
so either I wanted to try this look so I
removed a hat as you probably guys seen
in the intro but I removed it out so you
can see exactly what it looks like and
what this hairstyle really is honestly
it's a bang all the way as a 360 bang
that's all it was um but I wanted to cut
something very similar to this but I
call it the Ike Turner now I turn her
jacket so I don't know where it is now
because I just redid my closet but I
wish I could find it but it had like
this the shingles right here the yeah
and
mm-hmm so this is what it looks like all
the way around this is Miss Lula's hair
this is their this is a 360 so the great
thing about axis 360 frontal is that I
was able to cut it all the way around so
the bottom actually like all of my
frontal was able to be even sometimes
when you do this I could easily do this
with Bundle hair but it was much easier
to do this with just a frontal and
bundles as opposed to a regular front so
that stops from here to here so as you
can do now what I was saying this here's
got a lot of movement people like it got
a lot of movement you know what I feel
like I feel like one of the beasts
little under killer tofu that's what I'm
feeling right now
but it was very easy to cut lob will say
that this was very very very simple
because the fact that the cut is so
simple and easy we just literally cut
some regular china bang and then you cut
the side and you all just be like dude
and then you just go ahead and cut it
you cut it you cut the back as long as
you want it Mary sometimes in very
sometimes it's like bigger back here
like this and then sometimes it's really
short like this based on the pictures
that I looked at so I kind of went for a
more in between look so you can kind of
see the look is but I will say I do
enjoy I do I don't know how often I wear
this look though that's the only thing
and knowing myself I don't know how
often I would wear this now the great
thing about this being a wig as opposed
to it being a weave is if I got the
beauty is if I want to if I want them
real low I can make them real low if
they too low I can make them a little
bit higher you know if I wanted a little
bit on the side I could like you have
all these options when you have you know
you make your units on the way cap you
have all these options down I couldn't
make my bang like really full but I feel
like it already has like the he-man
haircut situation going on I didn't want
it to so much look like a helmet so I
left a little bit of space so that when
I do wear it you can see that I still
have a forehead
it's not like I have this you know force
field of hair that's just not going to
move so this head I got from Urban
Outfitters and I thought it was so
fitting for this because of course I got
I went to Coachella would do I don't
know about this jacket because it
probably was hot as hell but you know it
gives you a very nature cool breeze vibe
it goes when you don't want to wear that
this also isn't just a like our 90s rap
like I've been when all the girls in the
90s we're learning a room here um and
everybody's real hair was you know
burned and pressed to ignorance and it
was just where like my mom a lot of her
friends they would just wear their hair
like this and it was good you know it
was it was in it everybody with all them
damn flips and then when I go ahead and
wrap their hair in a circle with all the
flips and then they would have this nice
little wrap when all of a sudden
finished so this is their Brazilian
straight but I sent me four bundles of a
24 I believe and I chopped it down to
like a 12 I'm really like but I don't
know what I was going to do and that's
the thing I don't know a lot of times I
don't have plans for the hair until I
get the hair and then once I you know
get out of whatever else I'm doing and I
get fully immersed into what's coming up
next
then I'll make the decision but a lot of
times I would like just in me I'll do a
curly style or I'll do something
straight related but I don't know what
that's going to be unless I haven't kind
of pre start out which are usually done
um so as far as the bundles go as you
guys can see it's still a lot of
movement in this hair is not you know
stiff or whatever and I will say I
haven't had any issues with Miss Lula's
of straight hair not ever
it's very bouncy it has a lot of life to
it it does be I like to call it the
plexiglas have you ever skipped like
some plexiglass and like just hold it in
one like this and it was like I don't
know it's weird but it's like that like
when I had the bundles that it was they
were very strange they didn't have these
frankly ends I didn't have any split in
thank God
cuz I something was without a lot where
I'm getting a lot of here with
tremendous amount of split in and then I
always trimmed the hair for my 24 goes
to 22 damn-near depending on what the
hair company is so I did have any issues
there as far as cutting in hair I did
have a little bit of issues with trying
to even it out but that's more so of me
than it is with the actual hair so
that's my technique as opposed to the
company but I didn't have no problems
with cutting it like I didn't want to
cut like it it's not that filler I've
been having a lot of filler issues in
the lately I haven't had major filler
issues with this bank card so that was
good to know that about 99.9% of my hair
was actually the original 1b color you
know and in some areas in looks more
like a - it just has like this it is
ombre look where it goes from like a 1 B
and then adventures off and it becomes a
little lighter at the end now as far as
bleaching goes it is a simple bleaching
just not nothing major if not nothing
crazy however I personally if I was you
I would not bleach - they're just things
um just what I experienced it wasn't
terrible but I can tell that if you try
this multiple times you may run into a
bit of an issue and yeah that's not
something that I'm you know I'm too
excited about before I did cut it
I actually curled it because I wore it
in our warden is like oh when I'm gonna
say it the old school style ain't old
school because we was doing it back in
2001 but just a flip and I just wanted
to see how it would hold a curl and
especially that because it's heavy bang
in the front and they didn't give me any
issue that held the curls with you know
like a pro so that's good because I just
did some hair back that would not hold a
curl for anything in the damn world so
it's happy to know that little baby is
kicking and it
it's still it has a nice flow to it you
know I like when you know you're not got
a convertible so when I weigh and hated
I want you to be able to say see my part
but then it go when I shake it up it
goes back this is giving me very SWV I
believe that koco's here was like this
at some point I got my Coco nails on
girl but you know what I mean so if you
guys are interested you system you know
it's a little different from some very
okay cool straight hair this outlook I
would suggest it here from grading scale
I would give this era name
this is doesn't wrong with it for me but
if you just plan to wear like this are
you plan to wear it straight this is
another good you know okay here there
she should be able to get you through
the summer so if you guys are interested
in this from Miss Lula's hair this is
their Brazilian string that I cut like
mary j blige and um yeah i will catch on
and my deal in the tutorial it is
because the girl is gonna be real
shortage it's gonna be what did you do
get y'all in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
