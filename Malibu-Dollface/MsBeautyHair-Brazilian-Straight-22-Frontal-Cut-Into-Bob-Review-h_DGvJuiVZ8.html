to be extras today because I feel good I
was sick so I feel great now okay okay
so we're gonna talk about my hair I'll
remove my hat in a second
it's working fur but my hair I wanna
definitely let you guys know about this
cuz it actually was very fun for me hmmm
you'll see that just extra but no reason
okay so this hair that I'm rocking is
from a company hold the mist of beauty
okay my hair is they're Brazilian
straight and it is in I do not remember
what my lens toured because obviously
they have been cut so it's been quite
some time and I cut as soon as I got it
so I cannot remember for the life of me
what length it was it was pretty long
and I cut quite a bit of hair off to
achieve this look so if you're trying to
achieve this look or anything close to
it than anything from a 16 hour shorter
could work for you I wouldn't go as
short as a 10 because you won't be able
to get the the level difference but if
you do decide that you want to go for
more of a bhavish look or anything
shorter than that then I will do 16 and
Ryan's head is 2 or 14 just depending
the back has got to be at least a 10
because it's extremely short um but let
me get to the hair let me let me just
let me get to this just because I really
did enjoy this and you see my hair has a
lot of movement
still to it and I actually bleached this
hair a like a for to knuckle for and I
didn't like how it looked with this so I
got it back to a jet-black well it's I
dyed it to a 1b um I wanted to do jet
black but I can find enough boxes so I
just you know when with this look now I
love the fact that it's really full
which some people are gonna be like I
don't leave my hair there for I do I'm
one of my BOB to be asymmetrical and
stupid but I wanted it to be real full
too because I find sometimes when people
get Bob's or you do Bob's especially for
this time of the year I feel like it
just don't be enough hair like it just
be real thin and it starts to look like
moms Mabley like nobody won't dead my
frontal this is this is one of those
fronts holes that gave me no problems
like soon as I put the bleach on it took
solving it with a wrench of life within
under 10 minutes it like took that quick
it didn't take 40 minutes or 23 minutes
or thirty two minutes actually took very
well a 13 is a 13 by 4 because my part
in space is a whole lot more than it
would have been on a regular shorter
frontal and because you guys know I just
if you follow me on snapchat you guys
know I went back blonde for like a day
and that frontal is actually shorter
than what I'm used to so I was like I
don't have a lot of parting face going
on with this particular look now
originally if you guys probably seen in
the beginning the video that I had a
middle part and I tried to make it work
I just do not like myself with short
hair and middle parts it just doesn't
work for me and I don't understand why
but I just don't like it but I do you
got as you can see is this is still kind
of there because I when I put it in when
I did my hair originally I of course you
know use my costumey glue so that it
won't move but I have put the part in
the wig to start off with then I went
ahead and switched apart over to the
side part now here's the thing that kind
of threw me off about this entire look
is that it looks very similar to
remember when I had like the
it was a was a full lace wig and I had I
think this shirt on or I got like 80
t-shirts because when I'm trying to go
to the mosquito fashion shop trying to
find something that was similar start by
like seven different versions and see
which one went best for my outfit but
whatever um I have my sister come over
and she had did the short James Dean cut
on it so it was a wool hide in this and
I probably haven't had a chains on it
was very similar to what's going on
right now so I just switch it up okay
get a little stupid you look
so vogue well now stick I won't think
that this is some really good straight
hair I won't say my baby cuz I'm wearing
I'm not gonna say it's my favorite
straight hair ever only because it is
processed so I did have a hint of a
smell to it that I did not like um and
that smell does I periodically I do
still smell it I gotta get all of the
chemical own I want you to hear quite a
few times but I didn't get it all the
way out that's the only gripe that I
really have with this hair is that it
had a stench of a smell that I didn't
like and I also can smell it when I'm
flat on her hair too far as the actual
hair goes when it comes to a curl I did
like a loose curl situation on this
where it was like ah uh you guys watch
Empire you guys the girl plays Nessa her
hair always like a loose like a little
is it
I like a wan curl like a very loose like
you just hold it for two seconds and let
it go that kind of effortless bad hair
curl it was kind of like that and it
actually held the only thing is that my
hair is so full that is it falls pretty
quick because of the fullness I do have
in four bundles and a frontal so if I
don't think to achieve this look I mean
unless you want it this pool um I was
old for fondles but I think that three
or even two and a half with suffice but
for me just to be on the safe side way
anybody I would say three just because
you don't want your hair to be thin and
again when you do cut your hair
especially in a
especially when you're going to cut in
comment like this words is from here
here is a shorter here and it comes
around you want to make sure that you
have enough hair that's going to support
the the hairstyle because sometimes
people will cut it so short and they'll
put all these foam in bundles in what
ends up happening is the hair starts
looking extremely thin after you don't
cut all this hair out so please keep
that in mind but overall I will say that
I do actually really enjoy this
now I will say I'm gonna I'm gonna
bleach this again um but I'm a bleach
just here so it's going to be from here
down that I'm gonna bleach I'm not going
to bleach my roots or anything like that
and now I'm gonna put a color on your I
like red or Albarn or like a wine red or
something like that
just to kind of jazz it up a little bit
and then I'll probably do more of like a
wand move necessary like a warm curl
type of you know situation just to
change it up and switch it up a little
bit but I will say miss Duty hair you do
you guys definitely get an a-minus from
me because I feel like your hair is
actually up quality and like I said the
most hair after a while ain't gonna do
this and it's been nice in two months
and none of that so definitely keep that
in mind and usually when I review um and
test out straight hair it's much easier
because usually within the first day of
me wearing it I'm walking in it running
in it sweating in it fighting in it
disrespecting somebody in it it'll tell
me what its gonna do usually wet
straight I mean with curly hair and wavy
hair it's much different it's a little
bit harder to kind of test out because
in certain circumstances it may be
better and another one know if the hair
don't stay like this and it won't move
and it won't keep doing this and busting
one of those and that for all the kids
then chances are you that your hair's
gonna end up being very still I can use
a lot of product in this either I make
sure that key blue very low on the
product just because I want to make sure
that the hair still kept afloat and I
can get a big heavy on the product
depending on what look on
but because I noticed was going to be a
very flowy you know as you can see loose
look I wanted to make sure that I did
something that way show you the movement
that the hair actually still has after
the time because I've heard a lot of
horror stories from you guys but I got
my hair and it was really nice and
pretty when I first got it and then it
stopped flowing and then it started
looking at miss and then it got stiff
for me and then I started come on you
know what are you putting in your hair
and they be like oh yeah I use the same
hairspray you did and I used a lot of it
and then I didn't wash my hair for a
week and then I'm like okay so this you
you do that for a week this is gonna be
real stiff on you okay when I did cut it
uh I use I thought I did it with
scissors at first it was a blunt cut you
guys know I did this uh a review like
sometime last year before I moved and I
had like a red a turtleneck on and it
was like blunt here and that's the look
our originally was gonna do again but
just make sure it was even this time but
because I was just kind of getting low
antium crazy when I first got it cuz I'm
like I just want to kind of see when I
pray before my color on I just didn't
really like how they look I had it in
the show like it was like about here and
then I was like mm I don't really like
this and I don't really like the color
so the color changed then I took some
clippers and I did a clipper cut on the
back and then I just Clipper cut it from
here all the way down just because it's
easier with the Clippers is even because
what I wanted was a blunt look because I
know I was going to bump it at the
bottom and it was going to do exactly
what I wanted it to do which was give me
an asymmetrical bob situation without it
looking too thick I mean this is cool
but I didn't want it to be like crazy
thick but I wanted some fullness to it
and I also didn't want to have to keep
cutting when you if anybody is you know
you specialize in cutting you know it
can take a very long time for you to
achieve a look that you want depending
on what look you want with some actual
shears when you can just take some edge
and hit baby in the back and then there
you go as the same thing different
techniques so again
Oh miss beauty here you guys get an
a-minus for me just work on the smell
whatever you guys are processing this
heroin because it says that it's a
Brazilian up I don't think it's that
virgin tell me in the comments if it's a
virgin but I don't think it's a virgin
my thinking is Brazilian hair is what it
says but I think they definitely have
processed this hair because most regular
hair like non process here is not going
to give me this much movement at all
which I don't mind the process just let
me know what I'm buying but I don't mind
it because it definitely I know a lot of
my virgin hair that will not stay like
this that's the thing it stays straight
it does not get poofy on me that's how
those process but I do think it's some
really good hair and I do like the
quality of a yo I can't so let me know
what you guys think I know things are
bit different so we're upgrading for the
new year people or her Joe groans yeah I
know buddies they might not just build
away by myself but anyway I'll catch you
guys in my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
