a sweet tooth and no he got me sugar and
Amar's I'm saying through nobody okay
guys so um I'm back to what I know which
is the gray this hair is from a Miss a
Lula's hair yo y'all know me Lula and
had it out in the past however we've
become really good friends as of lately
they actually what kind of hair that I
want and I as lately you know it's been
kind of I've been trying you guys know
I've been trying to get out the box and
do something that I haven't done before
so I was like I definitely want to do
the gray they had uh you guys know when
I did my gray originally I had actually
colored my hair gray but they had some
already stock right here and I know a
lot of people who said they didn't feel
like doing it or they just didn't want
to do it or it was just too much work so
I wasn't gonna do it I was like well let
me see you know how you guys gray hair
works or whatever um and this is the
result now I am currently wearing a
closure from closure started I color
myself and I'm sure you guys can tell
that the color of my closure is not the
same color as my hair and I explain why
in a moment
I believe my inches are it should have
been in the beginning of this video but
if it wasn't for whatever reason I'm
believe I'm walking to 24 to 22 in a 20
this is the last bundle that they sent
they sent me six bundles but I couldn't
pick this one in this give your idea of
what the hair looks like when I first
received it it has the body wave texture
to it and it has so as you can see this
does match however my closure does not
and this is the reason why normally when
I do great hair I always shampoo my hair
with purple shampoo because that's what
you're supposed to do which is the
shimmering light shampoo however when I
got my hair I looked at it in the bag
and I did not take it out the bag so I
didn't realize it had this very lavender
hue to it like such so when I did do my
closure I did it just the regular grade
that I use and then I went ahead and
rinsed it out and made it like more
about aqua greenish color that's what's
coming up on camera um as you can see it
looked like more of an aqua greenish
color and then it looks like like
lavender purple at the bottom that's
what it looks like so we're going to say
that's what it is um if I wouldn't knew
that I would have went ahead which I
want to do once I finish this review I'm
just going to take the shampoo and wash
my closure with the ending is going to
end up being this color but because I
already had did like four other wigs and
I was testing out some other hair I just
didn't have time to go back and do this
so unfortunately I wasn't able to do
with this time around but I don't have
my other granny Maud because I ended up
cutting it into a bob so it's not long
no more it's very short so I didn't eat
some more this hair curled so good as
you guys can see I'm gonna have a little
camera go you guys him look at recently
her hair been popping
um shut up to Tokyo Styles I like this I
wanted to do something a little
different I tried this excuse me piece
of hair I tried this with a middle part
and I did it originally when I redid my
other hair I tried done with a middle
part too and I just found that it just
meant it was too much going on in my
face so it just did I had to switch it
over so I just pretty much turned my
hair to the side pulled it over and you
know it worked out to be a nice little
side part will comb over throw over you
know um but I do really do like this is
if you guys are looking for somebody to
look home and this hair has been lifted
but look how nice this is you see like
it's buttery so I can show you some
bundles that's rough but it's really
really nice and I rinse my hair because
I my bottom bundle for whatever reason I
ended up getting it wet because I was
doing something else and the bundle was
they were both sitting there with some
other hair that I was
colouring and it got wet so I rinsed it
in nm I like the lavender color none of
it bled out which was a good side I made
my way you guys always ask me like how
was it put it in do you have a you know
we're gonna do you sew it in and so
everything to a cap I sell everything to
a wig I am almost done finishing how to
make a wig my make a wig video with
straight okay so I'm brush through it so
you can see how easy and how it snaps
back after our run a nice little paddle
brush through it so it's kind of because
my lipstick I put on my like four
different black lipstick sitting up with
my Mac of lip glass over it so it had a
like it was much shinier but my hair
keep getting stuck to what I had like
black stuff on my face as a side note so
I had kicked it with Tootsie time and I
listened forever and we had went to the
beach and I decided oh I'm gonna wear
black lipstick wore black lipstick and I
had glasses on and they kept falling
because we were on the bikes
why was there lipstick oh alright yeah
black lipstick you gotta keep my eye on
because it will slide no matter how
matte and liquid drawing whatever it is
so this kind of gives me an old
Hollywood vibe if that's what I was
going for you know how to pull out my
fur cuz I felt you know with the black
on the black on the black with the
braids / lavender um with the black I
just felt it was necessary I know but it
is it's very very pretty well treated
hair like look how beautiful I didn't
put anything in this the only thing that
I did was play after our curl did I put
some of my Chi maximum hold hairspray in
it and then I let it sit overnight so
that my crows could fall cuz I heard
them really really really like super you
do pretty tight and I knew that by once
I got up in the morning that once I went
ahead and comb these out they would stay
but they would last for quite some time
I love love love this hair I wish it was
more of a gray side than it was lavender
however I'm going to go ahead and just
go with it and don't go against it and
go ahead and fix my closure so it can be
the exact color of this I wish I had a
frontal okay I wish I had a frontal I'm
actually wearing my six 1306 13 closure
tick base closure from closure store I
had another one that I actually found
and I used it for this but when I talked
about everything as far as the hair is
concerned I said they didn't have any
closures that matched this color hair
they only had hair and one thing that I
did love about this is the fact that the
roots are black okay like my closure is
the the worst thing is even when I did
my gray hair the one thing that I had an
issue it was when you are putting this
in and it's gray from the bottom to the
top then the issue is I find that if the
wind blows any sort of way you have to
make sure your tracks is good and back
but because these are all black up under
here then I'm good but because when like
when I do blonde hair and it's blonde
from the roots down I have to make other
I just sold the hair in a certain way so
that it will not move meaning it won't
be as flexible as I would like it to be
so yeah I'll put the link to this hair
below as well as their links or social
media links it's worth mines follow me
at Malibu Dollface and I'll catch y'all
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
