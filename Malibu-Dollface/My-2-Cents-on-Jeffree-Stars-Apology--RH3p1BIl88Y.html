to rule going from errands with me today
I haven't talked to you on a minute
either so a lot of you guys have asked
me because I am a makeup lover somewhat
I do like makeup in the whole thing and
yeah asked me like why don't we ever see
you in any jeffree star makeup and then
in a recent video I did mention the
reason why I don't work well I didn't
say why I don't worry jeffree star
makeup I just simply said I don't
support his brand that's what I say now
you guys have been following me since my
old channel and when I used to blog like
my entire life with all of my friends
you guys know in about at least two
videos I am wearing jeffree star
t-shirts and I supported Jeffrey during
that time when he had a lot of
merchandise that was in hot topics I you
survived stuff because I felt like this
guy is cool out of the box
he's androgynous he's doing this thing I
want to support somebody that's like me
you want to support people you feel like
I'll like you because I feel like me and
Jeffrey I don't feel like I know me
Jeffrey are lying a lot of ways we are
not alike in a lot of ways and we all
make mistakes and we all do things and
I'm so this way because these hills is
killing my soul um we are not alike in a
lot of ways so for me I personally don't
necessarily want to just lynch somebody
and say because you said something so
long ago that you know you should be
held to that even though you know what
he said was in a small pickle or
whatever he was talking a lot of
 so cut to the chase what I'm pretty
because I also don't know which if you
don't I
you got back in the day about 12 years
ago Jeffrey sorry did some some videos
well he didn't do somebody recorded him
saying calling black girls nigger
bitches and calling a Hispanic people
Mexican people of wetback convenors is
all types of just at every possible
despicable thing you could say to a
person or whatever he was saying so
those videos when he got on YouTube
which she's been on I think for like two
years now don't get yo started to
resurface back on the internet and a lot
of people took issue with them so then
they started circulating and here's the
word I think a lot of people have the
issue with our audience Jeffrey as he
will address the most minut thing on
snapchat or tumblr or tiny check
whatever they will do go anywhere to get
his point across for drama especially
drama that does not involve him the
two-faced drama didn't involve him the
nigga calling our Nicki getting
involved him but he put himself in that
drama so put into something that drama
he knows how to address something when
it's wrong but I always felt like but
why is it that you can't get on camera
chill dress everything that doesn't have
anything to do with you but you had
instilled for this here
just everything that doesn't have
anything to do him but yet when it's
something that serious like saying that
you are a racist why is it that you
can't get on camera and talk about that
and say if you don't feel that way no
more than say that you don't feel that
way no more but just understand that
regardless of what your feelings are
right now back in the day you said some
 that sometimes for most of us is
unforgivable this person so I get when
you are upsetting you are mad he
explained like you know when I was a kid
I was you know different never the boys
wear makeup like many people talk about
me and spit on me and do all these
things
I went through the same thing you get
what I'm saying I think means I feel
like a year apart play at the same and
you probably got a little bit better
honey just can't even Duncan's mom I'm
just saying play
cut to the chase now after the whole
drama with Jackie I know I will leave a
video below for those who want the whole
entire drama of what happened and the
drama with Jacqueline that had happened
in he I feel as if he didn't he didn't
apologize really for anything other than
the fact I apologize for getting caught
that's what I think it is and for me
personally when you say sorry it's not
sorry but I'm sorry Jesse okay so some
people like walk you want him to
apologize he apologized and now he
apologized anything enough well the
problem with apologizing is the fact
that you can't half-ass apologize or
apologize to a group of people who were
not necessarily directly affected by
something that you said now in no means
am I saying just recalling somebody a
nigger bitch just took me out the game
and I can't do with this life anymore
and what that has hurt me so deep
because they're really good
I live it I've heard worse than better
so it's what it is but the fact is there
are people who are not like myself who
are affected by who look up to him who
think he's a great person who think and
I'm not saying he's a bad person but
he's like the rest of us he's a flawed
person and we've all said things and he
of the moment that it's work we're
recording I probably would have to say
sorry - for - a couple of folks just
saying you know but at the same time it
doesn't give me an excuse to say and do
the things that he did and feel as if
they are okay in their way 12 years to
address it now everybody addresses
in their own time that's your business
I get it but at the same time I
personally don't feel that
what he said addressed anything other
than the fact that I know the jumping
those videos and me acting a plum a
school and I hate the fact that I got to
see me in my true colors at some point
in time in my life that's what I took
from it so in what really drew me off
with that because I went to the apology
with an open heart hoping that he would
say something that made things but the
problem was it was all about I mean
sorry that's what I think it the whole
video it was a selling he was reading
calming of expressing you are despicable
I was despicable what I said and you
weren't asked when I was in asked for
what I said and what she said was
unexpected what I said was so unexpected
you like that's what I took from it
wasn't to me a heartfelt apology of I
 up and what I said was wrong and
I really apologize and at that time I
may have been going through something
but what I was going through did not
warrant the reaction that I gave and
unfortunately those moments were caught
on tape we all have them but at the same
time it doesn't negate that what I said
was wrong and what she did say that and
I think it's more so about how you
saying versus what you say because the
whole best story of what he went through
in it and being a kid from a cop a lot
of us have issues like that too and I'm
sure he tried to appeal to other people
but at the same time that she has
nothing to do with the subject at hand
because what you're pretty much telling
me is the reason why I acted and said
those things because this happened to me
and everybody reacts in a different way
but Dustin is not an excuse it's not an
excuse but it is an excuse because you
used it I'm not going to say something
and then say well let's not know it's an
excuse
don't ask you should have just simply
said that video could have been five
minutes and it would've been over I
apologize from what I've done I'm sorry
so all of the people of color that
Finnick with the words that I spent and
I should not have ever let those like
what I said was disgusting and it just
makes me sick to my stomach so much so
that it's been going around for three
years and you listen to your something
for three years and you incited to say
something to get Jackie I don't put your
ass on blast about what you're saying
because that's what I'm taking it for
him I don't feel like people hate
Geoffrey a lot of people root for him
and I was rooting for him at if we were
all rooting for you and I feel like this
was a very whatever as excuse to kind of
skim over I got my summer lunch coming
and ate it and I want to just make
people who are affected by what I said
still is if that's not what I meant and
I want people who are not black but
support everyone to not want to not buy
my product okay because I'm sorry and
somebody says that I'm a person who's
done something or said something
especially discriminatory the first
thing I'm going to do let's address it
because I want to let you know that I'm
the furthest from that okay so it's all
about watch your mouth that's
pretty much what it is watch him out
those things that he said were
downright rude and disrespectful and I
don't know where I was it um but anyway
I said all this I said all that to say
we all got to be responsible for the
things that we say where the we things a
fool or not we still have to be
responsible for the people that we
affect and the decision she talked about
about the death threats and all that I
go to that too you know and I get him on
that's why there were a lot were alike
in a lot of ways because I understand
how he feels when there are people who
are going to come and say things and
people think that
when IBM pop off on somebody which is
very rare because I don't follow him but
when I watch one of the drama channels
that are talking about Jeffrey going off
on somebody it's never really about ten
going off on somebody cool um wishing
your guts until you go like
group some big-ass tease so it never
like about him going off on somebody who
was like warranted or it deserves it
more so seems like it's always somebody
else's drama that doesn't involve
anybody with him so the problem is the
fact that he likes drama and liking
drama usually makes things worse because
then people start to look at you as just
a dramatic bitch who every time you open
your mouth there's some so for
me go sir for me I just feel like
it was it was a way for him to
try to just address something I keep
haunting him and he did just that and
now he feels that everything should be
over it should be good it should be fine
it should be dandy and we should let it
go and everybody should work jeffree
star cosmetics can't do it those I
actually have some lipstick from him
that Goldie brought for me that I liked
a lot
I like the formula I like all of that
but the problem with it is the fact that
it is you know I can't separate the
artists when they work I'm sorry I
kidding okay some of y'all can and
that's fine and any but I'm not
encouraging anybody not to support his
brand like I said he has good products
but having the products does not take
away so she's good she's a girl
um I wanna some tight that's why um
but having the product doesn't
necessarily let everything that you've
done in the past make it go away you
know then he also I feel like as a brand
owner he has a bad tendency of speaking
too damn much and ending up in a
situation where people are looking at
him like he's crazy because you don't
see the CEO of Apple sitting back and
arguing with people on social media
because they don't like their product I
mean apparently Kim Kardashian ooh
that's Jackie I know but so I don't know
I just can't support Geoffrey and the
things that he done I'm happy that he
did issue the apology for people who
felt like they they needed that apology
for me it was just a little too late and
we all make mistakes and I want to be
forgiven if I did something of that
magnitude but I just don't go around
saying racial slurs to people and feel
it okay about it and they're waiting 12
years to reply because now have a
business and a reputation to now uphold
and keep to keep the lifestyle in which
I've accumulated off the backs of people
that are just pretty much demean and
talked about so yeah that's all I gotta
say about that and I don't care child
about expert okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
