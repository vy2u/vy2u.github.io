video for like a year and I just haven't
done it and I felt like today was the
perfect day because today is Barbie's
55th anniversary slash birthday so it's
also my best friend Sir wills birthday
so if you know his Instagram or you know
his Twitter do please wish him a happy
birthday for me so um yeah I'm going to
do pretty much a haul of some of my
favorite Barbie items no this is not
good this is not everything that I own
but this is a lot of my personal
favorites out of my collection of stuff
these are a lot of things that I really
really do love um so with no further ado
I'm going to start with the jacket that
I'm wearing which is my 1987 Tony Alamo
jacket let me just say if you are from
like if you were like a teen during the
80s and stuff you remember these jackets
Miley Cyrus wore his Beverly Hills
jacket recently and then the price
skyrocketed but um yeah it has it's a
superstar Barbie one some of you guys
may know but Nicki Minaj has this jacket
as well oh if you were wondering but it
has a superstar Barbie here has her name
and has a superstar here and then on the
back I had superstar right here as well
and then on the back it has like a huge
bar-b-que nice team hope so it has a
huge Barbie on the back that's a
superstar um these jackets are really
really hard to find they're very
exclusive
they were very limited quality when they
were made um this is an extra large and
I'm a very tiny person but I like
actually like how big it fits on me like
it actually is very cute a little bigger
because I have a smaller one too
um but if you do find these if you do
want one because a lot of people like a
lot of collectors and stuff for a lot of
people who just like like Barbie want
one of these jackets my advice to you
would be continue to check eBay because
that's usually where they end up um do
not pay over $600 for one of these
jackets because I don't feel like
they're worth over $600 I mean they're
nice jackets and they're very greatly
constructed because everything is hand
painted it's not like a machine but it's
just it's really expensive especially
nowadays to try to find something and a
very good quality of a good price it is
exclusive it is rare so you're probably
going to spend a pretty penny but try to
haggle them down for the price um this
particular jacket was about $500 um my
other one
however the other thing of my collection
is this particular Tony Alamo jacket
this is the bit less you can see there
is a difference this is the beach blast
this is a superstar Barbie um but this
particular jacket
unbeknownst to I guess the seller on
eBay I got this Jackie years ago she
sold me this jacket for $60 and I guess
she didn't know what she had so she sold
me the jacket and then I looked it up
and I started to do research on it and I
was like whoa like chick just missed out
on a whole lot of money cuz I showed
with a baby like five dollars um but it
didn't come with the original
rhinestones I put those there because
these are supposed to be in colors like
the beach blast right here I mean the
ball um but they didn't finish it and if
you guys know anything about Tony Alamo
then you know he's not a very nice man
and Mattel sued him because they feel
like he tarnished Barbies um and
reputation after he did what he did if
you want to know what he did I suggest
you google it but um that doesn't take
away from the fact that he was a
talented guy with a great eye for detail
when it came to stuff like this so when
I do wear these jackets people do ask me
a lot of questions and asked to buy them
off my back and I always tell them no
because as a Barbie Collector there's
really no price unless you're trying to
buy me a new car that I would give for
these jackets so yeah these are very
exclusive I love these they're going to
run you between five hundred and twelve
hundred dollars maybe sometimes even
more depending on who you get them from
so yeah off those um the next thing in
my collection is something I recently
which is this and this is my Barbie
lunch box but I'll actually use this as
a makeup hope
and I hold all of this this is the
makeup that I use pretty much every day
all of this stuff is stuff that I use
every day so I keep all of this stuff in
here my face plus my primer um my my
lips my lipstick um my lip gloss says
all that stuff my um Beauty Blender
everything goes in here and they just
kind of keeps it a little more compact
and a little more organized and having
it in a bag or even like a makeup thing
it's just it's just easier for me so I
do like this
um the next thing is my Barbie Cup which
I just brought another one of these I
have another one and I got this from if
you wondering what this was an inside
it's the paper
how much is $14.99 at the Mattel store
and if you guys are from LA or been to
LA are you going to know that the Barbie
corporate headquarters are here in LA
and El Segundo and at the corporate
office is at the bottom there's a story
so it's called the Mattel store and they
sell exclusive stuff like this um for
like hot wheels and everything that they
make Monster High and of course Barbie
so I got this one and I have another one
as well that I used mr. my car though um
so yeah I love this everybody always
asks where did you get these from and
I'll be like oh I just got them from
making exclusive I'm just playing I play
I got in front of the tell story um the
next thing is how I got my name and it's
the Malibu Barbie I love this dog we're
wrong I have the aisle here go the
Malibu Barbie um this is not the
original Malibu Barbie this is a
reproduction from her 45th anniversary I
want to believe but this is my favorite
Barbie of all time I remember and as a
kid I'm not that damn old but I remember
as a kid seen um they had like this
throwback thing and every showing like
all the old commercials and I seen this
commercial and was like oh my god and
ever since then I've always loved Malibu
Barbie so this is definitely my favorite
we almost the same damn color so yeah um
love her one of my prized positions in
my collection um the next thing is
is and some of you guys may remember
this doll from when we were younger of
some of you guys maybe a little too
young to remember this but you know
Barbies been a lot of things in her life
and one of the things that she was
before Nicki Minaj was a rapper so this
is the rappin rockin Barbie um she was
actually in storage I found her in
storage and freaked out because I really
dug his dog was lost and um I've been
collecting Barbie since I was a kid and
as you guys can see I didn't play when
it comes down like this doll came out in
like 1991 okay
I remember getting this at the KB kids
store in the Crenshaw mall so yeah um
it's all her friends on the back and I
know
okay the commercial is what I remember
the most because I'm sure somewhere too
and it was like oh the boombox the works
but she was like Fredman rockin Barney
and Robin wrecking crew it was it was
something like just look at the damn
commercial I'm bad when they come down
music yeah it was like rubber arm around
me something something something in a
wrecking crew so I want member seeing
the commercial was like oh my god I have
got to have that oh my god got to have
it so um this is one of my favorite
dollars in my collection because her
hair is everything is is how our my hair
now not the style but the length like
it's always to the but always so yeah
love her and then the next doll in the
collection is my Dione clueless doll and
I know you guys are thinking why she's
all dark I don't know I guess they only
had this color dark batter at Mattel I
don't know but um besides the fact that
she's the wrong color I love the fact
that she has our individuals that are
actually brown like the movie these were
based on the show the coolest show not
the movie but you know whatever
um but it does look just like Stacey -
though that's the thing it looks just
like her and I love that and she has
like the little backpack home I remember
everybody in the 90s was wearing these
little bear backpacks
she had this gaudy horrible outfit on
but you know it would be coolest without
they'll fit so yeah I love this dog this
is one of the originals that I still
have from a kid I don't have our box
anymore
but I do still have her and that's good
I didn't get Shearer um or amber because
I felt like they were just kind of like
whatever because it wasn't the original
share and I like amber and a movie but I
really didn't care too much for her on
the show I feel like ty should have been
on ok that's not what we're here for
okay the next thing is the 50th
anniversary generations of Dreams Barbie
which I love this doll you guys know
this is the one I'm afraid I've posted
on Instagram like every other day oh but
yeah I love the dress I love the detail
of all the patchwork that shows you
Barbie throughout the years um and for
those who are about to ask black Barbie
is definitely in here there she go she
over there um well yeah I love this dog
and if you guys know love kisses 99 here
on YouTube she actually brought me the
african-american version which I love
and I was maybe trying to sit her
something for the longest and I keep
forgetting she's been sitting but I will
send it but yeah um I love this doll I
had this in Caucasian and African
American one of still my prized
possessions I have another one that's
like packed down because this one ended
up having a nick in it and then on the
back I don't know how that happened but
yeah
bloom is so yeah I have that one and
then the next thing is these two
particular dolls are two dolls that I I
don't even let people touch because I
love them so much
um but here's the back of the box now I
know you guys are familiar with this
logo so you can only mean one thing and
that is the Christian Louboutin Barbies
I love these dolls they came out in 2009
um they're everything I these are the
best renditions of a designer that I've
ever seen Mattel do I think Christian
Louboutin himself he did a great job
collaborating with Mattel to make these
dogs I like the fact that all the dolls
have red hair and not blonde hair I
think it was something very different um
each at all it's three dollars in the
collection I only have two unfortunately
the first one the cat suit when I cannot
find so if you guys want to be nice to
me and you guys want to buy me something
you guys can buy me that doll it's the
first like a cat suit on its like a
black cat suit
I'm just kidding but no really but um it
came with a calendar it has like a each
month has a different sketch of shoes on
it like how this is sketched at the
bottom but has each shoe and in each dog
comes with a pair of four pairs of
Louboutins
they all have red bottoms they all come
with boxes and they all come with the
red bags so I thought that was the
coolest thing ever because even now like
the shoes on eBay dig separately just
without the doll are like $60 it's like
dead serious so yeah I love this so I
got that one and I have this one which
is the this one is a dolly forever this
one is the amaura and it looks like the
other one on the back umm this is the
third one that second one and I don't
have the first one to Italy um but as
you can see she comes with and I love
her shoes her sugar taupe and I've seen
these um at Neiman's in person they're
really nice but you see she has like the
bow in the back of them like and they
are red bottoms at the bottom um I love
these I love how each pair of shoes
comes with a box so sometimes on eBay
when you do find the shoes separately
some people will sell them with the
actual Louboutin box to match the shoes
which i think is dope as hell and i
think this was one of the smartest
collaborators you know Barbies work with
everybody she's worth for Sachi she's
worked with Calvin Klein she's worked
with I mean like everybody I'm waiting
for her she's worth with Jeremy Scott I
know you guys going to say that she's
work with Jeremy Scott but not for a
doll line it's been for like adult
clothes for her 50th anniversary but
hopefully Mattel will kind of get it and
Ken will get something too you know I'm
just saying though so I've showed you
this particular doll in the beginning
and this is the most recent doll that I
received which is the Sports Illustrated
Barbie and she is a very hard to find
out because she sold out in like a
couple of hours on target calm she was
1999
this is the doll that started oh I
actually have this doll um it's not one
of my favorites so because I hated
Barbie but I think well I wasn't alive
when she was created obviously but I
just don't like our face back then she
just looked real like sluttish so yeah
this is they sold out they're going for
like 150 on eBay right now and I only
paid ninety nine twenty seven dollars
with shipping cuz I ain't got no target
red card but um yeah this is the
exclusive nobody really has these are
very hard to find if you do you're going
to find them on eBay with the prices
number ridiculous I am not selling mines
and when she goes for like 20 grand so
other than that I will be keeping her or
ten uh I will be keeping her but I do
love this dog I think she looks great
and compared to the original like with
the bathing suit I think they did a good
job to update how she looks and she
looks very reminiscent of Malibu Barbie
like the whole glasses and you know that
whole thing the tropical feeling all of
that so that's cool I really do like
that particular I didn't think I was
going to like it but yeah so the next
thing is something that I wore on with
my other jacket and people went crazy
because they like where did you get your
bow from but this wasn't a bow this was
my Barbie generation of Dreams scarf and
it's a silk scarf and what I did was I
tied it in my hair and then I put it up
I'll probably put a picture in this
video of what it look like and everybody
was like where did you get your scar
from what did you get your bow from what
are you usually they're really hard if
they're like everything else I'm about
to show y'all if you didn't get it when
it came out it's gonna be really hard to
find it's a little wrinkled but you know
it's really long it's silk and sometimes
I do use it to wrap my hair though if I
want to just keep this whole Barbie
thing if I'm feeling very barbie-ish
when I go to sleep I'll do it why not um
the next thing is my Barbie generations
of Dreams duffel I mean tote bag um some
of my new parts and stuff I use this to
store that I don't really use this bag
like that I just pretty much use it to
store a lot of my hair stuff that I
don't necessarily use all the time or I
want to keep it for good keepsake I do
have that stuff in here and has um black
Barbie
um and if people brother asks do I have
any black Barbies yes I do I have the
original like my mom's black Barbie
um she's put up though she's not like
available like to just be seen she's
like in storage because I don't have any
more space so yeah I do own that dog
just an FYI but yeah this is um this is
the tote bag from the 2009 year 2009
50th anniversary and as you guys know I
cried and I kicked and I cussed about
not getting this duffle bag and this is
the 50th anniversary duffle bag and I
wanted this so bad I kept getting beat
out on eBay cuz they're really hard to
come by or recently it seemed like they
just been popping up everywhere but for
four years I waited for this backyard
for four years I waited for this bag and
I finally got it so I was very happy and
I was so happy that I got the bag I got
another one so just to show you that I'm
not lying that I do own two of them if
you follow me on instagram you know but
yeah I do own two so two duffel bags um
I'm excited no I do have the body tag
right here that I have on mind um when
I'm traveling as all my personal
information on the other side and then I
have two more it's like there are two
hills that goes on this one too so one
of these is my carry-on and the other
one goes like on the plane um you know
just so you know to mind everything
matches you know and I have a little bit
on duffle bag too but it still doesn't
in my book equate to that one like
that's just like nobody has that and if
they do um good look because they're
very hard to find and the last thing
that I want to show you guys is
something that is very close to me
because I've had it since it came out
and um I found her like two years ago in
storage
my grandmother had kept her because she
brought her from me and they were very
expensive so she never got rid of it but
that is my three-foot-tall
my size Barbie I don't you guys like
really yes I have
my size Barbie she says so much she
stands on my dresser um when I got hurt
and no her hair did not look like this
um she was in storage because when
people try to take my Barbies away from
me as a kid tried it oh my grandma
didn't believe in throw anything away
that she spent her hard-earned money on
and these dolls were like a hundred I
think they're like $200 when they came
out you know and I was about this height
so she was literally like my friend so I
thought that my granny had got whatever
she had never said any she forgot it was
in storage so I found her a couple of
years ago I dusted her off she was still
in her original box which I ended up
getting rid of because it was just like
tore up but she actually still smelled
like fresh plastic she was still I had
the net on her head and everything now I
remember playing with her but I do
remember putting her back when I would
finish like how she came in the box like
I would just didn't want anything happen
to her so she was actually still in very
good condition her hair was a mess
though it was damn near matted because
it was so curly and big so I boiled some
hot water dipped her in there
cut her bangs and there you go gave her
the classic Barbie bangs so yeah um she
came with a skirt oh she all saggy it up
in here girl but she came with like a
longer dress skirt in here but um it was
for like little girls and little boys to
play with so they can put it on um but I
took it off it's actually in my room
somewhere I put up but I just took that
off so she can just have like that and
she still has her ballerina slippers
that she came with but um yeah um that's
one of my favorite things in my
collection because everybody doesn't
have a my size Barbie and I remember
when they first came out this doll came
out in 1992 so yeah a lot of the things
that I showed you guys are very old
because I got them when I was a kid and
I've been collecting Barbies and loving
Barbie since I was a little bitty boy
so to have a lot of this stuff is kind
of nostalgic I look at it some of the
stuff that's into my room I do look at
it sometimes like why I remember when
this came out you know I was I was just
excited you know as a kid Barbie was one
of those things that I never felt weird
about because everybody had Barbies boys
and girls
you know some people like we're not
supposed to play with Barbies but it is
what it is and now I've grown up to be a
Barbie so it's great it's it's come full
circle right out you know but yeah I
hope you guys enjoyed this and I hope
that this kind of gave you it inside of
who I am it's like a Barbie Collector
because I know you guys have been
wondering like how extensive is your
collection this is not nearly everything
this is not it don't even scratch the
surface on the of the amount of stuff
like Hollywood hair Barbie and Barbie no
rockers like I have a lot of that stuff
so I'm sure if you guys grew up on this
thing you know exactly what I'm talking
about
hopefully at one point I will be able to
show you guys everything um but as of
right now no I can't show you oh I'm
missing something
oh I'm ready to show you guys no Pablo
my Brandi Barbie so yeah I don't know if
I showed this or not cuz I did this
video toys but yeah this is my Brandi
Barbie um and I love this Barbie because
she's inspired me to want to have my own
doll because it looks so much like her
baby hair and all like oh my god Barbies
had a baby here you're like I don't want
mine to look like I want it to look more
like on this side versus that that's a
little bit much so yeah um a quick just
a quick look about that but yeah I hope
that you guys enjoyed this and if you
guys have any favorite Barbies that you
guys remember growing up put them at the
bottom or put the commercials like link
me to the commercials of the dolls that
you love the weather's the first Barbie
it was a the one that had the foam or
the pregnant Barbie what wasn't Barbie
was midge if you ain't know um yeah just
a whole bunch of stuff just let me know
um how you guys feel and what you think
and if you have in a collection and you
want me to see it make a video and link
me to it and I'll watch it just to me a
message and I'll talk to you guys later
