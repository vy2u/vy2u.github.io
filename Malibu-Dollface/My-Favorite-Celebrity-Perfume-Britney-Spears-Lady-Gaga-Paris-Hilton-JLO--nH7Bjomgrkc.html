especially when I meet a lot of you guys
in person I always actually would do you
have Owen like as far as with fragrances
I like to wear um and you guys know I am
NOT one of those guys who likes the
musky s man know everything on my
calendar is for women but you know and
most I'm not gonna take most everything
for the most part 99% of the stuff that
I have our celebrity from friends
celebrity sins uh I used to work her
when I was like 16 like male curve and
when it ran out I was just like over it
so these are some of the my like go-to
fragrances that I would suggest to you
guys and before I you guys gotta buy
these there are so many uh perfume
counters you can go to and smell these
things for yourself before you actually
purchase them so the first thing that
I'm gonna do is I did not think that I
was going to like this thing I thought
it was going to stink because of the
color I thought because of who it was it
was gonna stink but Lady Gaga's fame I
thought was going to stink and
surprisingly it smells so good um it
comes in a bottle it comes this is a
smaller bottle this is the one I'm
currently using I've had this one for
like two months it comes in this bottle
where it opens like this I don't know
which size this bottle is this is though
the one full ounce bottle but the big
one looks like this so as you can see
there is a difference between the two
I've yet to use this one but I got this
fruit always in just as a disclaimer go
always go to Ross before you buy any
fragrances go to Ross because Ross
prices are way cheaper than
clothes and we're in Macy's just go to
Ross okay because I usually have them
you can get a big ass I got this big ass
single lady gaga for only I want to say
was 15 or 16 dollars and the same bottle
at Macy's it's 56 dollars you got me
 all the way up if this is your
first review with me sorry but I do kiss
a lot I get over it but I'm gonna give
you the roll okay um so you go to Ross
cuz it's mark but um
this black fluid actually smells good
the fluid is actually black which I
thought this is what threw me off and I
thought I was going to stink and I was
like I bet that's just smell like hot
booty and Knuckles like I bet it was bad
but it actually smelled pretty good it
actually smells good so it had the
smoker because I brought - this one
actually came in a gift set he came with
some body wash and the body wash is
actually black - um so since it's like
Christmas time like around the holiday
season they're having I got mine from
CVS it was $20 um and I think it was buy
one get one it was buy one get one half
off so of any gift set so I brought this
one and I brought my grandmother one too
cuz she tried to take my I said girl
don't get in your mouth so yeah love
Lady gaga gotta give it to her for that
I don't like Oh PARP what is her album
called our pop pop life all that
yeah I don't like that okay so um the
next one is JLo glow you can't go wrong
with JLo glow I mean it's it's classic
like it smells great it smells good this
is a smaller one because I don't buy the
big bottles my mortgage as you can see
after this review I have so much other
stuff but I do keep this just as a I
just bought this one um it's kind of
like a keepsake just in case I want to
try something different that particular
day but she never the hell she was going
with this she did that I imagine this is
where she smell like so JLo glow it has
more of a clean smell Lady Gaga has that
sometimes I like the musky R smell nah I
don't like okay hold on I don't like
musky nothing people feed armpits hair
weaves
I don't like musky nothing but I do like
that it smells darker then that does
like I mean obviously the colors are
different but this one has more of a
darker smell to but it doesn't have that
musk that hit you right up here that old
lady musk like white diamonds
hell no I would I would wanna burn every
bottle why'd I mention stinks but
it doesn't hit you right here has a soft
smell to it that's what I love about
everything that I'm not too sure has a
very soft smell doesn't have a very
putrid ass smell that women want to
throw up or nothing so that's why I love
both of these the next one that I have
is and it's about to be Brittany central
because you guys if you follow me on
instagram you guys know that I am
serious about the bridge
um but it's a Britney Spears circus
fantasy I do not like curious by Britney
Spears and that one smells like old lady
so I don't like um curious but the
circus fantasy comes in this bottle this
is a three-point three ounce bottle um
and it smells it has like a I'm trying
to think what does it smell like it has
a candy smell to it but it doesn't smell
like a child's perfume it does it smells
like what a circus would smell like it'd
have a cotton candy smell to it
not like blue car candy not to pollute
not the pink one yeah it has like a well
I don't really wear this one that much I
just brought this when you know yeah I
got this bit down Ross it's about that
life I got this big-ass bottle that is
usually $59.99 at UM Cove for $13.99 a
rose with me some of them deals see
I'm a frugal Easter I which I get a
lot of but I don't pay for Bryce
buy that the next one is the hidden
fantasy by britney spears i like this
one i got this one last Christmas
um i don't use it that much this one is
kind of like the lady gaga one this is
more Britney's darker smell as you can
see it's a lot left in there but this
one has more of a like if I'm going out
to somebody's birthday party and it's
like at night I like Benihana or
something I'll wear this instead of
being so loud with the other ones I
might to show you but like they have
this she just she has a thing for synth
I don't know you can call me whatever
the she want but you can't call her
as a funky bitch
as far as her sins go beyond I mean talk
about that that's just rude the next one
is the classic original fantasy which I
love so very much because this is what
started my obsession this one is empty
um you know but I have a small gun I
have like a whole bunch of smaller ones
that I use but this one is the bigger
bottle
this is 3.3 ounce bottle um and look at
the box comes in like this it goes it
closes like this and then this goes on
top of it um but this is the original
samurai
first melt this ice melted in a gift set
and I was like oh this smells like what
I always want it like it still it's just
this one has more of a sweet candy smell
to it but it's not like when I say sweet
don't automatically think like candy
think like sweet like if you was in a
bedroom with your boyfriend and you want
it to be sweet for him
you wouldn't want to smell like a child
you want to smell like a sweet ass bitch
like that's the type of oh sweet it is
and then this one that I love so much
it's the midnight fantasy wherever the
hell is it okay okay here we go the
midnight fantasy this was the worst or
will words a lot he's melted on me and
automatically just just went and told my
chick in arms hand he distilled it from
me he brought his own but you know he
want to fight but you know what I mean
but this is this one empty too but um I
have just Oh weird I thought I brought
the smaller bottle but the smaller
bottles come in this box compared to
this box um but I thought I brought the
bottle of the smaller pool who cares but
yeah this is what this one looks like
you know our bottles pretty much all the
fantasy bottles are the same um so yeah
I love this one
this one I have to say is my favorite
out of all the fantasies because it's
something about it it smells I always
say it smells like midnight it has like
a blueberry smell to it but it's not
like it's another her sins are
overbearing where it just make you go
girl what you got on oh it's it's like
what is that like it's so pleasant it's
so soft it her sins feel like they don't
feel like that you know you don't want
them when somebody walking around a be
like pal like them oh that's me that'd
be trying to get at you time on some how
old are you now them no you know they be
smelling like old ass man I hate that
like you got on Kerry Ellis everything
damn so yeah as far as the Britney's are
concerned I got all of those I have the
twisted fantasy which comes with um this
one in this one but it's in like a ball
and you break the ball apart and just
one cent on the side and once it but
it's in my car and I use those you know
because before I get out the club when I
just I like to be like Paris Hilton I'm
going to
asking the ambience speaking of Paris
Hilton one of my favorite scents by her
and my only favorite scent by her I know
a lot of people like the one the girl in
the void that I think it's called just
me by her I don't like those those
things but this is empty
um but it is a can-can by Paris Hilton I
love this I love this more than I
love this this was like my go-to cleans
him but this
yeah it's just oh no it's not in Theia
still a little you know something it's
pretty soon to go for the same now okay
I'm not to smell like every celebrity
and I did this one time I smell like
Rihanna's her sting Beyonce's her sting
I'm Celine Dion's hell no Halle Berry
smell like a lady
um I smell like every female celebrity
that you could think of the how to scent
at a time so yeah
Paris is this I don't care who you are
or what you feel about Paris Hilton if
you like a soft fresh scent this
campaign is about that life these are
usually twelve twelve seen at Ross
twelve nine thirty two dollars was the
original and it's a damn small one the
big ass when you can get that shit'll at
Ross for thirty I think no the big one
like this at Ross is $24 for the Finch
let me tell you Ross is about that Ross
t.j.maxx and where else I don't know oh
and sometimes Oh Big Lots but Oh big
loud my homegirl brought some
Beyonce she said it was still but I
think that's just with the way that
Beyonce smells fail but listen if it
smell good you know who dick okay y'all
are gonna hang me for saying this but I
don't really care you know who did not
smell that good initially with them when
you let that sit I got that mustard
on like Nicki Minaj I smelled hers and I
was like let me give it a chance cuz she
a very fruity type of bitch she real you
know she she looked like these two damn
boxes half at a time so I'm like it
gotta smell good so I smelled it and
know she it up by putting the
in the perfume and that wasn't good
and the last thing that I'm gonna tell
you guys about was it's not a celebrity
sin or anything but this is called the
citrus coconut from CBS this is like a
body sprays essence of beauty it's like
bad the body works but it smells so good
I thought coconut and citrus was gonna
smell like straight ass but it actually
smells good I smelled this because my
grandmother got it for a gift from my
auntie and she didn't want it and she
didn't want to give it to me so that's
why I want to give her my gaga because
she just send you like that but I went
off and snuck off and sprayed it smelt
it and I was like a lot of guts to get a
new one I got to get so I got to I think
at CVS right now they're like three for
$15 so I got two of these and then I got
the lotion so yeah this right here smell
like I said everything that I just
showed you smell it before you buy it
because your nose and my nose are two
different noses you think so and
sometimes my nose don't look like mine's
either when I contour the line so if you
are interested in any of these check out
um like I said Ross TJ Maxx sometimes at
Target they have a lot of gift sets a
target right now um CVS or Walgreens um
TJ Maxx rose and Kohl's post and also
the Britney Spears has another one
called
Island fantasy but the reason why I did
I get that one because I had to order it
off of somewhere else because Kohl's
only had they had the 3.3 ounce bottle
as a sample where you can smell it but
they didn't have it in the case they
only had the one point one ounce bottle
I'm about those little ass bottles for
$34 bitch you got me up so I went
online and found the ship for $22 with
free shipping on the 3.3 ounce bottles
you know sometimes those deals you had a
finding when you gotta find it so I had
to wait a little bit it's still on this
way but I'll let you guys know I've
already smelled it I love it it's
everything it's going to be one of my
new favorites so you know it is what it
is so thank you guys for watching and I
hope that I have opened you guys eyes a
little bit um for some of your sins are
you away have been wondering what is
that celebrity since smell like so yeah
these are all the people
poverty don't ask me to review Beyonce
don't ask me to review Rihanna cuz she
wrong is for that funky I like
round I really do but her oh so
yeah I hope this help and I will talk to
y'all later peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
