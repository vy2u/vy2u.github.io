like it's different when I'm here on
YouTube and then we like have a
conversation versus when were on like
snapchat or Instagram and then we have a
conversation so what are the things that
I had actually guys to do was give me
like a lot of snapshot questions about
my I'm like my favorite music or
whatever well long story short I just I
started using this camera and then I had
to change some of the settings when I
forgot it initial about hyperspeed like
20 times so I couldn't slow down or get
the audio up so I never used it would
like ironic I'm gonna ask the blonde
here and a crunch off the one that was
that day I did it and then it just
didn't work so I wanted to do something
I still do that I'm your half yard but
you know that you own snapchat that you
open it you can see the like don't
work anyway so I just wanted to do a
series worth like my top 10 favorite
something so we're going to start this
this off with my top 10 favorite army
albums ever now this list was narrowed
down from my literally every song that I
know every album that I listened to if I
like it I'm sure on it so I went through
I get all of my albums I have like 5,000
songs on my ipod ok it's really nice
trees so I went through these my phone
my favorite song so we're going to go
through my top 10 favorite army out of
all times my not sure what my okay so
we're going to start off with this album
now I started listening to this album
actually in like 2000 and I want to say
like one or two I started to listen to
the album actually found the tape in my
granny's house and I really would like
rules in a minute since you know I
listened to this outline it first came
out
I was a kid so I'm into the single that
I heard on the radio but that would be
Monica
miss Monica had quite a bit I believe
her last element called Code Red I
wasn't a fan I hadn't liked the Monica
album since Mustaine and usually laugh
at this time it was Monica brandy and
our label came out and those three
albums that came out that year
especially comparing all their first
home together
I still Monica has the strongest outline
and I'm a huge alia thing y'all know
what I love me some brandy but it would
be if I don't break them together guys
it would be marks and album brainy's
almond and I leave oh I'm not a planner
agent number the number only like young
nation and Street bang everything
yeah I'll believe it I'm not a victim
are Kelly and not like that how look
very Chicago very or Kelly not alia like
yeah so I'm not a big fan of her write
about I think was great too but about a
compared to Monica album that definitely
hope you don't know in no particular
order do just all but I just they just
speak to my soul but I have a moment
always the next album is crazysexycool
by TLC and I just feel like again the
second out second album type of bitch
like I really do like a lot of people
second albums versus their birth albums
if you listen if you look at the list of
people that I'm naming here then you'll
know exactly I mean but in all my
flightless
TLC growing up it was they had tone down
the colors they had definitely gave the
music a different swing it kind of went
from the early nineties to the mid
nineties and it everything slowed down
how to groove to it so for me crazy sexy
cool is is my favorite TLC all my
favorite songs on this album or take our
time let's take a time or educator that
one of our more chilling exam song crazy
could be in terrifically inner loops
used to be like
good and you use the licen like they
were songs but they were not swish oh oh
kick kick your game but I feel like
these are songs that will last at the
time so again I'm doing this because I
want you guys that always ask me about
like music or whatever suggests that
they haven't listened to try these if
you have never listened to somebody's
out time my next one is Ilias
one-in-a-million and you guys know this
is my album this is my era this is my
moment this is B and this was right
I'm repeating the one a million video
for the first time from the box if you
guys don't know what box is google it it
was a moment in time now when videos
come out vivo is just there we have to
pay for videos to watch them on the box
you gotta wait for them to come on we
get three digits you said make sure eyes
to write on their bodies new so
when I can order to the kind of Rama my
granny builder brush ordering the one I
gave him her too I got a woman but it's
cool oh wait what'll you book one of
those albums bad again I wasn't a big
fan of aging none but a number
I loved the singles off of there but I
just wasn't a fan of the album which is
a little too much artillery and not
enough Ilia for me this album seemed
like it was nothing but alia and
everything about it was hurt for the
production to the songs to the video to
the era to the look to the hair to
everything my favorite songs are in C
Street and that's an intro and I just
feel like that is like that is how you
start an album when you want somebody to
know where you're going that's how you
start an album okay thank you Tim Berlin
the myth you guys forever let me see
what is my favorite song there's a lot
like I love the whole album bow let's
see one of the money how much fighters
not one of my favorite songs a lot of
people love this Tom Graham just it's
cool even the reaming I like to be your
version more than I like the album
version where
a relaxing feature interests up my jam
the 2d lovers of smoothness grooming is
all too long for me and imitates too
long to get to the new version but I do
like her homage to The Isley Brothers
and you know she did that for the first
office and so I think that was great for
me slitter still one of my favorite song
everything's gonna be alright
jam yeah I'll give you more Jam I got
your back wasn't my jam like nobody I
ran that tape money into this door
Jorgen work write that hot plate it had
no you know like on the taste these
actually print based on which buys on
invite me thought everything was much
talking look like a bling tape
ladies in the house is my jam the one I
gave my heart to but I like the way I
gave my heart to diversion that's the
video version I'm just a video version
type of bitch
hey the video releases because I feel
like they're better than the album
version either Mike Brady's
brokenhearted I still feel like the 101
day is better than the album version
some people will argue with that but the
thing about you know my favorite out so
I feel the one I gave my heart to is
just a video I was going around I
remember business agreeable 2030 and
everybody knows that I was obsessed with
Julia and they were playing that day and
I had all in like a white shirt so it
was just all fitting for me to get an
arena thing I had no monia after that
but it was so worried because I thought
I was hurt I put my shirt on my head and
he was black box with the little it was
a short lead to Gladys who don't ask
about me I was a very different role so
yeah that's my favorite if people ask me
like what is your favorite early album
that would be a is a mary j blige my
life my life my life my life it's
something about this album back
it's a every time I hear this album the
certain thoughts that goes through my
hair there's certain situations I go
through my hair there's certain clothing
there goes my it's in his wagon Ross
today because I thought it would be so
things amiss
right one song on this album beside my
life back in my favorite song is Dumbo
baseline everything about that just hits
me in a way where it is like Oh Mary it
is one of those options that will never
get old it definitely hasn't updated
sound to it but I don't mind the date
just because it's such a great album and
I mean heard of Marriott mr. Benham I
married you you know she is divorced
from about the Cardin can - you can do I
hate to say this but when Mary
or hurt it's different and you think
it's better
oh it hurts it is making good albums I
love you see my next favorite album is
definite out the writing's on the wall
this album is the moment where deaf
child had a lot went under this album oh
Lord
so we had bill blue bill came out then
bubble came out then what - Latoya was
put out family god kill you a I
mean I'm sorry
we got variable then there got the boot
and then we do gotta Beach and all this
happened in the spannabis album
this was the album that I think for me
cuz I love a few shows in the shop
fellas Bobby it was definitely my
favorite member of my little sister's
level player but for me this was the
album that I think in a long time I was
able to listen to it from top to bottom
and every word every song there's like
everything about it all my crew was
amazing
so some of my favorite songs on it so
far Hey ladies
if you leave if you leave I hate sweet
16
how do we do better on and then
I don't like we could I got some other
stuff I know the employer version came
we get on the bus which was on the white
blue spotless contract which is still
one of my favorite albums it's not much
I can put it in this little a doubt
Timlin great okay so um if you leave her
hey lady hold on let me get reckless cuz
I mean mattified mention some of my life
honorary Jam confession temptation
durable out no ocean oh
I think this is like steal one of him I
personally feel a lot of you to say that
deaf people build a business I mean that
album but I don't think so I think the
writing on the wall even those who
didn't let are me like that you love
this album so the right amount of all
this is definitely a classic in its own
right that's why it went platinum 108 my
diamond honey everybody ain't gonna tell
nobody listening one gold they won't let
them survive about question talk about
used by doing them it brings back
memories I remember where I was living
at the time what a question at a time
what homework was due at the time that
didn't do it was fine it was a people 97
or 98 I think it's our man between those
two years and Erica was just new and I
would be so much care for like call my
room I know every word to that song I'm
just not a really big fan of it is by a
single song which is but you know it but
you not get such a favorite yeah okay
that wouldn't be a um play yes I
remember four leaf clover may muscles
used to call it liver gone don't ask me
yeah take a look at charm and then
what is another song like that one that
was everything just like the foot mixes
the remixes certainly are just it it was
a moment where it I think that I won
another thing is the most Erykah Badu
like the most authentic Erica because
she's always evolving she's still one of
my favorite artists although we bought
her a lot
but you love her from this out because
this is just one of those elements just
is I can't you know you can't not say
like not put this on my list because
it's such a great body of work and
inviting music and this during the time
where albums would span over the fourth
of five years where you're releasing
only four times but single would be on
the charts for so long and they didn't
perform them for a long brain you would
appreciate the music now you come out
with an out but bring y'all came out in
August and people don't feel like I'm
with rainy days I'm coming I was like in
the busiest month in division cuz you
know I hear into it so it was a
different moment it makes you appreciate
the music much more to the next is
Brady's and a lot of y'all are watches
Timmy to the walkers y'all have a
favorite Brady albums a lot of you guys
favorite buddy album is everything ever
and the other one is a top favorite is
full moon so my personal favorite is
aphrodisiac and to me I don't know what
Brandis new body of work is gonna be
hope it's nothing like pigs and
including girls don't let the phone for
the video at all sorry Bernie I love you
but I don't love it but after all these
yet all thought wasn't a big fan of
brandy look during this album I just
feel like she was trying a little bit
too hard and judging by her behind you
think she felt the same way but the
music like every song on this I have no
fun okay well I think I beg of you lie I
don't realize the ditty
I know the words credible benefit to it
what if I had a piece of fun but I'm not
the biggest fan of anunnaki will
probably be City but every every song
else I love especially towards the
second half of the album
so I hate you real deep
and funny story so I know every time I
hear this all I think of but but now for
ps2 because I planned that out on just
repeat and plan is being and every time
I hear it I think of like Dudley's
trailer me me and like Malcolm and all
if you played busting out you know
exactly what I'm talking about but it
definitely just holds this this again a
con capsule for me but I just feel like
Brady look at her best with Timberland I
see when I just think because you all
didn't necessarily do the best it
doesn't mean that it wasn't a great
album it just see maybe it was not a
great time to release y'all what I will
say sounds like focus and I try and who
I am
should I say something is a beautiful
song period um you can't ask for a
better production you know I love
Timbaland Ilia together but I look to
money bring together and if she gave
Ilia props in that album which I'm sure
that was definitely a Timberland uh
reference and influence but again
there's no other bring element that top
definitely there I don't care I hate
human I know people are going to die hey
stop out of human eyes I don't even
count that as an album I in my opinion
after aphrodisiac Brandy's neck album
was till we live in because human was
just bad bad I'm sorry it isn't next
album that I have on my list is B two
K's pandemonium I don't like the
and listen I know you guys know that I
was a huge piece of a fan and I am a
little crazy I got them still and
especially since the new edition movies
in caramel
I know be saying an era legacies are and
crazy it was a lot of drama that went on
but because first things that went on
there islands we think there ever be a
movie and there's life time decide they
want to cast you boys Rabi or J bugs are
I'll say anybody I haven't come here
that's how serious I am
oh I would want to see a movie about it
just because I was such a fan and they
were only out for a couple years but it
seems like the body of work of a guy was
forever so pandemonium drops at this
time I was a bit of a hermit I really
did leave the house like that but this
is why I probably have everything that
you say and ever done on TV or take to
the road home
what um everything to my granny to
target and I was like listen girl
there's an album by be petted him out
today all the boys have individual
covers I need all the covers and she
like okay whatever at this time they
were I think when I came on a car get a
pencil our I believe they were $9.99
they're migrating it's not a person for
research if I ask you to do something
especially Janice I'm sure we just
simply do it I've heard about me I build
with a my own name when she asked me why
she's brought so she doesn't get a
call and was like I'm looking at the
back of these albums and they all got
the same song on and I'm late no I want
the coverage you owe $40 worth of albums
because you use one different covers
like no so me being the breath that I
was at the time I got in her face and
heard loving me so dearly but she should
know she should have so bright nothing
he called me back in a little bubble
since you want to act like a little baby
I got you to album with everybody on the
floor I was like whatever bye
so at the time the warehouse was still
open and what you could do which i think
is like a full report now but you could
take an album that and I'll bet didn't
have any scratches in $10 and you could
get a new album and at the world albums
were much more than they were at target
and target did have you know I maybe had
me working at sold out so I was kind of
like
 so I took business so shady I said
my granny's Mitchell a all of them her
voice to men album her bodyguard
soundtrack and I think I took them on my
total team edition Pam and took it up
there and got the covers the problem
with that was that's what I was all
Mariana and I was my favorite member so
I was kind of bummed by that and I don't
think I got that official cover until
like a couple years ago on eBay but my
little cousin had it bossing it city so
maybe u correct machines and I just took
it candid and it's flipping into my
extra dribbles
oh but this album every song I love even
this somehow what you get and it's a
bonus track it actor jenay's dogs but
it's got one more thing like a six
minute track what a my favorite song
from that album I currently own I think
about nine pandemonium Alton I got all
four covers I got an extra days of
attack strategy I think the special
edition I had the regular one I will
never need to buy that I would get a
digital copy to our works in my mind but
um yeah out to me was basic a dress and
I I just felt it you guys listen to the
use Arthur contract those songs that we
got like the hooded call lenient so I
just feel like that's what the third
album would it became kind of totem on
the next album that I loved and I was
late to what a Murray's all I have I I
thought I did get into a memory until
touch him out I'd like talking to me I
didn't like what I was probably loved I
just thought to be able to do that I
thought the songs up and her favorite on
that note I hate it so I didn't get a
memory enough of a chance but when touch
came out that was the first single and I
just thought this was everything why she
that's a big energy okay
when one thing came out that was I heard
it order free spell I heard the beat on
a freestyle Friday on one of its apart
and it was a memory jump joint but
cavity oh yeah that cannot love it then
touch came out was obsessed with it so I
had to get young so you guys know Brooke
and like she used to love a memory when
she first came I said oh she's so
gorgeous and shelter first I felt like
girl with my mom she touched her oh I
probably I was doing 2009 I was just
like going through a whole bunch of
albums and I stumbled across this
somebody that gave it to me literally
changed my life like just died in your
arms tonight alone it solidification for
that album period so for me I'm like
okay so this is what like I think Emery
is a great composer she's a great
songwriter she's a great singer and
she's there simply using shown here she
has like a book club he's the most
mouths manner
we didn't woman ever and I think that
makes me love her even more and she just
had a tepee that came out hard drive
which is dope as hell um oh yeah
aha jam album that on this list is
Rihanna's rated R and this well I think
forever be my favor and OH although I do
like Wow a whole lot but radar just had
g4l in rock star what on what only fun I
don't like on this outfit of what is a
fire bomb I don't know what and it don't
rock park - every time that comes on
just the beginning just makes me want to
 die play I then album was
innocent after the situation to happen
with Chris and she came back and again
it was I think this is that what
happened what he was thought was gonna
happen because of what happened with
Chris they thought she's going to come
back and be like oh my you know what's
crazy to my face I thought she's gonna
do something like that play yeah
that were great that's why they're like
human because before human there was a
brainy Omkar welcome to my world that
was scrapped and she started doing human
well there's all sorry about what I was
carving and I don't like it but she came
back like oh the what's going on
I'm killing the game this is one block
so my hair off I got a perm I'm good and
Rudeboy and just even that intro was one
of those situations where you might yo
this bitch is he's not playing like this
is a real situation photograph is my
favorite song on that album he rolled
again rated R will always have a special
place in my heart for eatery so those
are my favorite army albums of all time
and no surprises people don't say what
about what happened what about that and
what about that but you know again these
around that came up and there's on there
there's a couple of honorable mentions
these are my favorite albums of all time
