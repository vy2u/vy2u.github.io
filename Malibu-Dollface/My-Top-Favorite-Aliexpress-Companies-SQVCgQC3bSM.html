going to give you my top al Express
companies okay again like I said from my
other video if you have yet to watch
that video you can watch it in the
annotation here these are like my top I
guess US companies I would say I'm not
sure um but pretty much they're non
Aliexpress companies and I did a video
on my favorite company so you can go
click that ear room
so let me get into some of my fate
favorite companies thus far that I
worked with you guys know that I was
very apprehensive about working with
Alex Perez I had my fair share of drama
with Ali's worth so but through all that
I found a couple of gems so we're gonna
start off with and these are a note
again no particular order they're just
some of my personal favorites so the
first is Dima hair stem ahead Allah you
say but they were responsible for this
gorgeous look and this was the hair that
everybody was so excited about which was
my body wave hair and I still have this
hair I love it oh it's still beautiful
the white pattern has however changed a
little bit uh since I straightened it
it's not a diss training because I just
want to see um and it wasn't really
straight I curled it and you know me
curly straightened out but it has a curl
but after I wash it it still has a body
with texture to it it's just not exactly
like that was um after I Co washed it so
I did myself
I changed the pattern but it's still
good
my next one is my spring hair and you
guys know spring hair is the hair that I
did a similar look to this but it was
the middle part and then I didn't like
it so then I recently just reviewed that
I really do like their hair regardless
of what has happened in the past they
actually offer
really good quality hair and the thing
about I'll Express that I have learned
from my personal experience dealing with
them even as a reviewer is that things
change and um whatever they tend to go
with whatever is poppin right now
sometimes these Aliexpress companies
they won't kind of stick to what they
know which is Brazilian body waves um
but they actually I like spring because
they actually kind of go with what's
popping right now if you're looking for
an ombre you can find it there if you're
looking for a braid you can find it
there they give you a lot of options so
I do really do like that about the
company I haven't had any issues with my
hair I would definitely suggest them
because they're actually a very good
company the next company will be style
star which I've only worked with them
one time and that was for I call it the
touch me uh which my sister claims it
was created in her what she said created
in with her in mind which so was not the
case she just wants the hair style
that's all it is but this is when I put
the two braids in the front and
everybody wanted to know how I did that
and y'all I promise if you can braid and
you can construct away that will work
but anyway um I really do like that
doesn't tell us more body weight here
too and it's it lasted the UM texture
has not changed however I did take the
braids out because I was trying
something and I did not put them back in
but that makes way for a tutorial for me
to do it the only thing is you have to
do that on your head I didn't do it like
off my head and put it on actually
braided to my edges when I actually did
it but again that's more stuff to come
so why not my next company is halo hair
which I get asked about this hair all
the time and I just took the band no I
just put a man in that wig which is a
frontal and I'm going to do an update
because a lot of you guys were asking me
how does that hair curl so I did like a
full style on it and I curled it or
whatever so I'm gonna come back and show
you guys um how it held a curl come okay
it's better straight my opinion
okay um but the hair itself is uh that I
like how is thick because I get the
amount of bundles of that game but it
did say bone freakin straight straight
no I don't think I've mentioned this
with hammer and it's not expresses to my
eye word glam buddy foreign chair if
anybody was wondering my so blase blase
my silk based um closure from closure
story if y'all was wondering what this
all lusciousness was that's what it is
but um yeah so it's been about three
months since I've had that hair and
that's a long time to be wearing here as
much as I change right here I definitely
like to rotate my wigs so I can get the
best out of them as you guys can see um
and that hurts really good the frontal
it's so based which I didn't know
because when I did it you guys remember
I wore it like my hair was covering the
Front's I didn't pluck it or whatever I
just plucked it the other night so we're
gonna use : with it but I didn't pluck
it and I didn't party when I started I
worried in I didn't party so you
couldn't really but the entire from ear
to ear is still face and I did not
remember that y'all I'm about to be a
problem just sayin
so halo hair yes darling yes my next one
is Miss Lula's hair and I always say you
guys you know me a little it was
fighting but we cool now and um again I
told I will tell you guys no matter what
I do when it comes to reviews if I'm
having issues with the company in any
way shape or form and the hair is still
good quality I'm still going to tell you
if the hair is shitty and the company is
shitty then you got two shitty
situations I don't think you want to
deal with but if it's a miscommunication
or it's a bit of a public relations
issue then I'm going to let you know
however I do like the hair the hair of
 you know they they fix everything
when I go back into that too much but
that was one company that I did have a
prior issue with that I don't have
you with now because they correct their
issue but even when the first issue
occurred I still didn't have a problem
with the actual hair I just didn't have
enough time to really do it like I want
to but when I was able to come back I
was able to do the middle part with the
nice waves and it was short which led me
into some other hair that idea from a US
company
well not hair but a style that I did I
had kind of pretty much got it from that
so I really do like Miss lose hair and
in my recent hair that I got from her my
gray hair will lavender hair um that
I've just recently fixed but it is great
great great quality and for the prices
that shoot you when I say great quality
I want you guys to know that what I'm
saying is for the price that they're
asking for it is great by no means am I
saying that it's the top of the line
great a hair if you need some nice hair
that's going to last you six months
six to nine months and they only are
telling you this to forty four four four
bundles on the closure I would take that
deal because the amount of hair that I
got in right now is over a thousand
dollars worth the hair that I'm wearing
right now okay and that's not even my
closure included so that's why I'm
trying to give you guys a nice
alternative this hair is not going to
last you forever okay because it's not
top right here they a lot of another all
I'll Express companies but a lot of them
do cook corners to try to make it better
so if this straight is usually if it
says straight virgin hair it's a nine
times out of ten it's been a processed
hair now when I think process I don't
mean as in chemical process but I do
mean it's been some type of sting
process it just depends but it's never
specified it just says that it's virgin
virgin can mean a lot of things these
days okay about two thousand in probably
seven two thousand five then that
probably would have really been virgin
and it probably would have cost a pretty
penny but again this hair is
it to last you I always say judging by
the amount that you pay for it okay so
it's usually going to last you if you
pay 244 for it then it should last you
somewhere between two to four months you
know
that's usually how it goes if it goes
past that that's wonderful but don't be
shocked if it doesn't because again you
still got a deal on it you know that's
why there's a difference between us
vendors and Aliexpress vendors there's a
big difference you have to pay for
quality people I don't care what nobody
says I cannot go to the Bentley dealer
and ask them to give me Honda prices
that's just that's how it works and I
didn't make these rules I just abide by
them that's all so the next company that
I really like is Lux
Weaver love sweep was responsible for
some of my favorite looks well that's
when I did a little bandana with the
side part I got the low situation
popping off yes love that hair love the
company and they sent me some of the
best damn lashes that I have ever had
they were better than Vegas neighs they
were better than our Dale I don't know
what they were because they were in
Chinese things too translated before I
see the packaging away just because I
was just so hurt that they didn't last
me that long so they couldn't been that
damn good but they was good
um but their hair has been great um and
that's another big company that I'm
really really really really really
really really loving right now and then
the last company that I'm going to
mention as one of my favorites
is max glam hair and this company has
outstanding customer service they have
great choices of hair um they have some
of the best frontals uh I haven't
personally not that nothing I know I've
have had a frontal from them as of yet
however somebody I know broader frontal
from them and it was really really
really good but there are really good
so those my dears are some of my
favorite Aliexpress companies if you
guys have any questions you can put them
below if you're interested in the hill
that I'm wearing um check the link below
as well and I will hit charlie</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
