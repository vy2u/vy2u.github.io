be a little bit different I have
officially who broke my ring light so I
got this rigged up room piano like while
I wait for anyone so this is going to be
a sit-down review I'm not gonna be
standing up if I only have one point of
light right now because yeah my birthday
is coming and I'm trying to let it get
all of my reviews out of a young my
kitties late
Oh cuz my birthday is on the 10th so I
got or like a week or some change until
you know anyway so this is my hair this
is a Brazilian body wave as you can see
from this bun it's definitely a body
wave texture and it is a 360 form toll
from my fashion hair now this frontal
came free club but it did come it did
not come free bleach and I wanted to try
this look without bleaching and not for
those who either don't know how are
scared to do so I wanted to try to give
you guys an option and say you don't
have to do it necessarily not from a
distance I wanted to go for like a nice
little messy bun and I can still stand
up and I have I found this cute little
windbreaker from forever 21 and then I
don't like some red sweats because you
know the type of girls get down I wanted
to match something that can be like all
this is showing so you can feel like
this would be a real look that I would
wear somewhere or judges so he has this
frontal came free plugs but like I said
not free bleached I'm going to show you
how to back just because
it is probably like a mess back here
because I couldn't see it has this
particular 360 has a adjustable band in
the back so I was able to just make it
really tight so it wouldn't come up you
don't have to glue it down I did not
glue this hair down actually taped it
down so it is a little bit different
here in the front so as you can see it
is you know baby hair realness up in
here in the front and this is how my
hair would be normally I wouldn't wear
my hair straight back into a ponytail so
I wanted to do something that looks very
natural so I less like pieces like this
and like that just kind of scraggly so
you guys can kind of see that this is
what your hair will look like on a
regular day if you just go on out if you
don't want to you in the middle of a
wash day or you may just not have any
hair and you need a natural wig then
this would be a good option for that so
I have four bundles of twenty is 28
inches of Brazilian body wave and in my
frontal is a 20 inch frontal which is
also a 360 spar bleach and it goes like
I said I didn't want to bleach it
because I did I wanted to give you guys
a chance to see what it would look like
before you have to do that process I
know the bleaching process is a lot for
people and it's a little confusing
sometimes you over bleach sometimes you
under bleach sometimes you don't want to
go back and read bleach so I wanted to
give you guys an option that was not
just we always do here on YouTube you
can also use like your foundation glow
you can use a foundation color and I
actually is running across or not
there's a lot of videos about it I won't
do one just because it's coming to the
point but I will say I really liked it
there I do I'm shocked because I thought
because with body weight what happens is
you get it and it looks beautiful
and then you wash it and then that's
usually where the trouble comes in but
this hair after I watched it actually
was still very very very full and imma
take it out of this bun so you guys can
see I think that's only fair at the
review right so I have two bobby pins in
here keeping this bun in and I just
loosely wrapped it around I didn't do it
really tight or anything like that
because again I wanted a messy bun look
I didn't want to end up
with its to meet okay there we go
so yeah well you see when I put it even
in the ponytail I did it very very like
loosely I didn't do it really tight or
anything like that so this is what the
hair looks like after I went ahead and
washed it now just a mind you guys I
wrapped it up so yeah so this is where
my frontal stops which is right here and
then this is where the rest of the hair
is so I didn't mess that idea which was
a hot glue gun method and then I also
did all of my tracks that were in the
back I did them upwards so that I can
actually split it into this ponytail now
a lot of you guys were asking me last
time when I did this could you wear the
hair down and you can wear it down it no
you can do it better with this hair than
you could with straight hair because I
tried it with this hair just to see how
it was going to look I did like the
half-up half-down and it didn't look bad
it didn't look no different than what it
usually looks like but just be careful
just because of the fact that your
tracks do go upward like this so you
have to keep that in mind that trying to
wear it down is still going to look a
little awkward the painting so obviously
my bun almost the same as it did when I
started to be able to target the chips
y'all know what it is it's body way
there's no different than what you guys
have seen before as far as the hair
texture goes this particular vendor
though I do like because it seems like
their hair is much softer and it does go
back to the original the original
pattern after you wash it I did however
notice that if I washed his hair a
little too much what is going to happen
if it dries out really quick so you have
to be careful with the amount of the
amount of shampoo and then also what
kind of shampoo because if it's so thick
base shampoo which most shampoos are
then it's going to such as dry the hair
out and anything that has a texture in
it when it starts to dry out it starts
to nap up and it gets matted so if you
guys are wondering why like your curly
hair your body wave here and even
sometimes your straight here and your
friend here is not 100% straight when
it's wet
what happens when it's dry it just kind
of locks up together and it does not
want it like
itself which is kind of an issue but I
do like this it looks like it looks very
natural looks like I just do my hair up
in a bun and I said I was going to go
run down to the store it doesn't look
like I try and it doesn't look like you
know it's kind of overkill I'll get a
close-up on my actual hairline so you
guys can see so my hairline looks like
this which is not bad you can still see
that I did not bleach these nuts you see
what I'm saying you couldn't tell and
that's kind of the only downside about
not bleaching your knife is that
somebody gets really close they can tell
that you didn't bleach and luckily I
only went to lunch today with my friend
and she wears many wigs undo so we
already know what it is but I did use
this this particular tape that got this
on so good so hold on let me show you if
my eyes are a little bit on the red side
because last time I was already
everybody queues me of smoking and that
was our smoke but I just did have you
probably I don't know if I may use it
for the intro of my I got my contacts in
and what kept shifting like I had a
little wonky ogia gun with it so no but
I use this tape that I've had for a long
time which is called the boat hold lace
wig tape and it's from a company called
the hair diagram that is also their
instagrams to the hair diagram I'm
telling you guys this tape I think it's
like 40 pieces and this will hold a car
together okay and it's not made for let
me just give a little bit of a
disclaimer this case is not made for
your hairline is made for your forehead
but what I did find that works for me
for me is that if I put the guys to be
blue only like put it on and let it get
hard and then I use the tape between my
hairline and my forehead because my
hairline does comes a whole arm so far
forward now when I remove it it doesn't
remove any hair because the gel is
actually keeping it down from actually
moving which I absolutely love
so that was an alternative because when
I brought it I wanted to use it but it
just made my hair look so Wiggy and not
natural so I've been using this tape
just because when I do styles like this
kind of sometimes want my baby here to
be on the dry side and with an got to be
blue sometimes you get it all in your
hairline and then a you you end up with
paste down hair that's not that's not
what you was trying to do and it takes a
little bit longer to it even dry this
works right off the bat I am this is not
sponsored a nobody paying me I literally
brought this with my own money but I
just want to tell you guys to my mother
by like four more packs this stuff work
so if you're looking for a good holding
Cape and check out the hair diagram for
the the bolt holes and that's what I use
for this I was going to try to do it for
the back here and tape it down but this
particular band for me I don't know if
the company does that my size wrong but
it's a bit bigger so I had to cut this
side so it's actually because sometimes
when you get a frontal in a fit perfect
if you go like this it'll fit perfect on
the time but it's too long on this side
or the other way or you end up with too
long ear tabs so I had to actually end
up cutting through the front so so it
could actually fit me correctly that's
kind of the only downside I can see
about this particular unit and I think
that's just with doing sizing even
though there's our adjustable strap in
the back it still is a little bit hard
for me to get something a perfect fit
because like right here I kind of
wrinkled it up a little bit putting it
on now this is the first time I actually
take this unit down normally I would
wear it glueless and you again you can
still wear this up unit unit I mean this
sound
Lisak you want so you don't have to gel
it down you don't have to take me down
but because I am actually wearing this
and I pull my hair in this bun after the
fact I can't really do that because it
would just slip right off so unless you
just put it like I've done before I put
it on a mannequin head and then put it
on my head but again I just wanted more
of a natural careless look and because I
went out shopping today I wanted
something that was outside of my face I
didn't want a whole bunch of hair in my
face because when I shop I need to focus
and it was hot today - so what's hot
where I would be dying in this top or
whatever so obviously this is nylons or
the hot it just gets really bad but it
was a little bit warmer than to have a
lot of hair around my face and I was on
where curly hair today - and I was like
so I decided to wear this and it's so
cool so this is
again my my fashion hair I'll put the
links for them below if you guys are
interested and yes got any questions let
me know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
