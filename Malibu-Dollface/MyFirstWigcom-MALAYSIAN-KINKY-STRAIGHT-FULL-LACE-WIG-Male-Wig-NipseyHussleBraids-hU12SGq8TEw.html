milk goes so damn right before with a go
like geodesy she forever my lady wanna
talk show
I'll tell Maury I'm gonna take care of
baby
hi guys yeah so see I told you guys I'm
trying new stuff why do you want to
believe a player you know all right so
this wig that I am currently rocking I'm
gonna show you my kitchen cause it
probably looks a mess but other than
that I think we're good it's from a
little company cold my first wig now let
me get to the specs PR because I know
some people like to ask me and I just
want to be thorough thorough oh okay
that's not it and I grabbed this with a
vengeance this is not if this is a
natural color it is 20 inches
the texture is silky which is a lard my
lace is a light brown and my size my cap
size is a1 with this they gave me a bag
that came with it like this and this
came with adjustable strapping in case I
wanted to you know slow this in and then
it also came with which I really do like
these clips a whole lot guys like hang
on line these clips be problems and then
it came with I believe this is yes a
comb a rat tail comb and then it also
came with and within the structure menu
I'm gonna do that as well
and it also came with this like wig dust
bag which is cute well sexy and then it
came with my favorites which are the a
double nude caps which I'm wearing right
now I know this is very unexpected even
for me I even arm in it is still off to
me it's different um and this is because
uh my first week had hit me up and was
like you know we're doing a Black Friday
sale we want to teach you a wig do you
have anything uh and in mine if you
don't only have this new very natural
texture coming out which I don't
remember what this one is called it
obviously will be here but it when I
explained it to me I said it's Italian
yeah they hit me up about it I was just
kind of like oh
okay and they was like you know are you
interested in doing another review for
us and I was like okay well depends on
what you're doing it's gonna be
something that I've already done before
no thank you
just give me something that I haven't
done that I can play around with and do
something a little bit different way so
it was like okay well we have this new
texture coming out and the texture when
I explain it to me I'm like telling to
look like Italian Yankee but I'll take
it and it was like you know as a full
you know it's a full lace weight which I
personally prefer full wigs over look
that I have to make because it's one
less time and it's much easier to
obviously manipulate so when I got the
wig the first thing that popped in my
head was don't you do after you guys
really were like really like the look
like the girl and a boy look that I did
from our Toy Story lookbook I was like
why don't I just do something like that
so from now now on a lot of my wigs will
be kind of they may be unisex in a sense
this could be unisex to just depend on
we're gonna grow your um I know right
now I'm looking like somebody's baby
daddy ace Iraqis boo cuz I think you and
yeah so you know I demonstrate eyebrows
I put a very sheer amount of foundation
um yeah and that's about it which is was
great because it took me all of like ten
minutes to get ready so to the wig this
is a full lace wig I bleached the knots
on this I did notice that we just say
this off top if you notice in my sculpt
is a little bit on my brush II thought
that's because I had to bleach this wig
twice because when I first did it it
didn't take the knots didn't take like I
wanted them to and the thing about wigs
that like I'm not good okay how explain
is when you get a wig most of the way
I'll just show you so here from about
here here is always back here is a
stretchable cap so if you will notice
the color that's here is not the same
color that's back here it is kind of
like two different colors and the color
in the back looks more like my scalp
than the top does and that's because
pretty much because I bleached
is kind of over bleach so then I was
kind of left with this and I kind of had
to make it work but I know now that
either
um I'll use a different there's a I'm
starting to use different bleach from my
bleach and even though I haven't had any
issues whatever just want to kind of
give myself a bit of a bit of an option
so I'm starting to use different bleach
uh all I did was after I bleached it I
let it air dry I didn't blow dry
although you can because this is
definitely human hair you can bleach
this hair although I would not because
the texture of this is very much so I'm
sure in the beginning you guys seen how
coarse and thick this hair is so only
thing I did was put a part down the
middle and then I just use some good ol
I use this uh lay right I use this good
old lay right and I use this for when I
have the short James Dean here this is
the palmate that I use for it it's
seventeen dollars but I got it from
Floyd's barber shop I don't know if you
can get anywhere cheaper you probably
just somewhere online much cheaper but I
needed it right then and there but I use
this for the parts to go ahead and comb
everything and then bright everything
down um what I had to do was I used my
bigger wig block to do this and I wish I
didn't know really what I was going to
do when I got it but now I kind of did
the trial and error with this if you
plan to do anything like this or
anything that's going to cause tension
in your hair and your wig at all make
sure you get a size up because this wig
would have fit a little bit better on me
if I had a size bigger because I would
have had to you know I could have
compensated for the tension but I'm
wrong it came out well um my I got my
stocking cap under here so it kind of
slid back as it always does
but um yeah I got all of this right here
are actually my edges and then my wig
starts about here and I just used my
baby here to go ahead in disguise the
lace that is a and around the front of
my head now if like I said if this was a
bit bigger I use bobby pins here in the
back but if this was a bit bigger than I
would have been able to take the lace
that is back here I'll show you in a
second the lace that is back here and I
believe been able to actually just to be
glued this down to and I would have been
good um and also
help if I woulda got me sit like a fresh
beehive right now I just got me some it
looked like this up underneath um so
yeah but I do really really like it was
very easy to braid it took me a bit
longer because I had to make sure that
before just a side note if you plan to
do anything like this do not cut the
lace off until you are completely finish
because trying to redo these braids with
not that extra lace in front to pin down
is a nightmare and I don't think you'll
be able to get it is slick like this in
the front if you don't have that extra
window so if I have to take these out I
don't know what I'm gonna do um but um
yeah I just went ahead and bright at
these through and when I was done I was
like okay my original inspiration for
this was Nipsey Hussle because Nipsey
Hussle
usually wear his hair like this all the
time and I think it's ridiculous I think
he's cute um and him alone letting just
had a baby so congratulations to them
and um I was I just want to do something
that's a little bit on the hood side a
little bit different but still work like
anybody could legit dude if you're not a
braid you can do this I just had to use
the big stick pins like the T pins a lot
of those around the entire perimeter
because you're gonna be grabbing and
pulling a lot and I used my bigger wig
block because I want it to compensate so
it would not like buckle it buckled in
the back because the stretchable panel
on the back is gonna is gonna make it
one two buckle on you so I had to kind
of this was a kind of a trial and error
uh with this this particular unit but
I'll get close so you guys can see what
it looks like I hope it's not leg but
this is what it looks like up close and
yeah nobody moved this was a league
everybody just thought it was my hair
and I just went ahead and braids in my
hair down after like a blow dryer or
something you know it has a stretch I
mean it has an adjustable strap here in
the back and it also has one comb back
here there are no combs here in the
front not that I know of and if they
were combs up here I probably cut them
out because it would have worked with
this it has to be as flat as possible so
if you have no hair this will work great
if you have a very little hair to mold
it back or very small braids in
this style would actually very much work
now the only downside I will say to this
particular wig that I didn't like is
that because this is supposed to
simulate scalp because there are bands
and straps and all the stuff that is but
the construction of this it made it a
little bit harder for me to braid like I
wanted to so what ended up happening was
I had to put more brains than I wanted
to there are four on this side and
therefore one inside up see how so
usually wears three on both sides so he
ends up with six I have eight but that's
the only thing and that's because these
wigs are not necessarily made if I was
going to do this I would have done this
either with one or two things a full
lace wig that's lace from here all the
way back or I would have did this with a
silk top unit because it's still top
unit of the silk in the stretchable
panel in the back are usually the same
color at least for me so once I break
them down um then it would look like the
same thing and I wouldn't have to bleach
anything so I did bleach because a lot
of people are going to ask I did leach
the actual stretchable cap panel on the
back because those are those of the hair
on that still need but they're not still
needs to be bleached but once you bleach
those because there is is more of fabric
stead of lace it just turns more like a
scalp as you can see more of a scout
color here versus up here where it's
more of a brassy color and that's just
kind of my fault because I kind of over
bleach because I to do it twice because
it didn't take the first time so my my
first wig I'm gonna give you guys a nice
tin only because I feel like this is a
great unit it's a great texture um
anybody could wear this and get away
with it it was very easy I haven't had
any major shedding with this I haven't
had any problems with trying to put it
on I hadn't had any issues like at all
and I'm totally in love with this I can
wear this on my bad hair hair days and
actually get away with it so if you guys
are interested make sure you guys hit
the links below they're also having a
Black Friday sales you guys are
interested and yeah all the specs for
this particular will be below and I will
get your mom a salon Prue's and tell me
did you guys like this though
because I'll do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
