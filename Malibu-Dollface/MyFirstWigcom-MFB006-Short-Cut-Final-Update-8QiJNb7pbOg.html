scuba so um this is very different from
the last time I came in y'all because
the last time I came I had a hat on and
things were a little bit different but I
did promise you guys that I was going to
come back and let you guys know what
happened with said wig and this is the
end result yeah I look like a Johnny
Depp and crybaby which kind of that was
kind of the look that I was going for
because I was in forever 21 and they had
these crybaby t-shirts with him just on
a front and I think he was holding I've
never seen a movie personally but I
think he was holding uh he was in jail
possibly I don't remember but anyway um
that's pretty much where this look kind
of derives from it was a mixture it's
kind of like a mixture of Ruby Rose
there's a mixture of I don't know if you
guys watched a TV show scream but
there's one character I think his name
was Karen his hair is always fly every
time I watch it I'd be like they got his
little swoop pompadour thing popping and
there's a girl on your name Aubrey and
her hair is always really nice Maria was
the bulk in the main inspiration for
this look because I was watching it and
I was like her hair looks really really
really really nice okay listen cuz I
just can't do it okay there we go um so
yeah those were the people that pretty
much inspired this look so what what we
decided to do was Jen I came back and
this side actually was crazy is you guys
know usually I wore my part on this side
so I was I had went ahead and cuz
originally when she did it I had already
glued it down like it is now but um it's
easy with the gossipy glue you just go
ahead and you just wash it out it washes
out with no problems and then I was able
to restyle it when I reached out that I
accidentally put the part on this side
because of the mannequin head so I had
parted on the wrong side and went to put
it on I was like I'm she liked it better
on this side
to this I so what I ended up doing was
keeping it on this side and I had her
come in cut this size some more like
much shorter so that I could do this and
lay down like I really really wanted it
to and then the back actually lays down
like it's supposed to however my kitchen
needs to be lined up so yeah but that um
but yeah like I have no hair out like
none and babies haha oh so yeah like
it's I don't know it's not really much
else I can say about it this was a great
alternative for me when it came to just
a wig itself because I just I didn't
hate it it just I couldn't do nothing
with that style and you guys know every
since my total can't you see wig I've
definitely been excited about short hair
I've had short hair for a long period of
my life when I was younger
of course my hair was always short I
always had a fade of some sort for years
I wore a flat top thanks mom
so yeah I was I kind of was over it and
now you guys know I wear X amounts of
hair but I would never cut my personal
hair this short just because it's just I
even I can wear wigs over it and keep
the front long and blended and do all I
want to I just like the fact that my
hair is in such a great condition I want
to keep it like that but have this
option to I just feel like it's fun to
have options like this uh so what I did
was I used this call lay right which is
the originally right I got this from
Floyd's barber shop Jan I used to work
there she told me that this was a great
this was a $17 but she told me to get
this because it was very uh it holds
very well which I believe guess maybe it
holds just right for the play you know
I'm saying so it definitely holds like
it's supposed to because she did a great
job now we are very different because
Jenai doesn't like color and she doesn't
like she doesn't like to lose do color
and she's not really one for doing hair
like that but cutting is her expertise
and she cooked me up some fabulous see I
use this later I didn't use the ultra
whole this is just a regular one but I
am
get the other one just to see how I like
it and which one I like better and which
one holds my hair better so all the
thing I did was I put the wig on I use
the gossipy glute I use the blow dryer
to get all of the ear tabs and all of
that good stuff down and then I went
ahead and put some lay right on the
sides to really lay this down because
when it is are just like freshly driving
there's nothing in the hair this side is
a little bit poofy because there is
still hair over here and unfortunately I
can't find any vendor that I could pay
to get a full like silk base full wig
like an entire wig that's certain
because if I was able to she would be
able to cut this side down right way
shorter and decide way shorter to really
give me um like a realistic that's real
Scout prickly on the side but I can't
find anybody so if you guys know anyone
or if you are a vendor of some hair of
some source and you sell full lace wigs
let me know but anyway I just use a
little bit water a column a rack a real
rat tail comb and I see why they always
have a damn comb because they this hair
does like to slip and slide with nothing
in it so put a little list in it rub my
hands rub it through and because I have
all of this glue down I can pull it and
nothing is yeah my hair is gonna be fine
and my fear was that my hair was gonna
look like somebody's mamma's like you
know girls get like women get short hair
I'm short cuts like Rihanna or Kelly
very like that I just hit one like
somebody's mom and when it's not like no
products in it like this that's exactly
what I look like somebody's mama but I
love this to death and I did have a
conversation with the company and I
asked him like there was a hole you know
would you do you have any suggestions
for new styles and I told him this one
and I said it was too short to cut this
cuz you're gonna see the lace you see no
lace at all so yeah um but there's not
many companies that sell for lace wigs
that are short cuts and that's kind of
that's what the the lace wig game is
missing right now how many people are of
y'all will like a wig this short that
you can switch on and switch off because
I love my 40 and chair trust me I love a
good 45 50 inch
but sometimes you do want to just bust
one of these you know put some glasses
on and call it a day you know sometimes
you interesting but it's so high you
just want something that's a little cool
so I'm excited I like this this is
definitely but to be my new Jewish I
might do a lookbook based on this look
cuz I feel like it's just so many things
and again
um you know I like both sides like
that's why I like to to just play in my
just my life and my hair and makeup cuz
I feel like you know it's easy for me to
do both
girl or boy just it doesn't matter but
um I do like a full face of makeup and a
whole bunch in here sometimes but I do
like this now I do have my makeup trust
me I'm gonna right now but um it's very
minimal I just have on foundation I did
use my eye contour my nose my cheeks uh
well my yeah my cheekbones I didn't put
any highlight highlighter on um and I
use a little bit of primer but that was
it and then I did my eyebrows but I
definitely did them where they didn't
look super artsy just look full like
most men's eyebrows do you know and this
with some glasses got the game so I hope
you guys enjoyed this and yeah let me
know if you guys know any companies that
have full eights wages that are short
you know or yeah just this this is just
ridiculous how nice this came out and in
company I think it's just because it
takes a lot to cook so a lot of
companies that we move to do that that's
just a little too much time we don't
have time it's easier to cut a bob than
it is to do all of this you know so um
but anyway let me guys know what you
guys think about the cut of and what
else do you guys want me to try uh soon
I definitely want to try some more stuff
you guys know I got another color coming
up trans hints well my background
changed but um yeah I'll catch y'all in
my next one
