here one around
okay so yeah okay I'm just gonna start
off by saying I do not like this week as
far as the style is concerned so my
sister is on the way and she gonna cut
it for me and I think I'm gonna have her
cut this into like a pixie or Lord go
varnish because I just do not like the
style at all
and this is the only style that I could
come up with I felt that would work for
this this hairdo so now that I got that
part of the way okay so this week is
from my first week my first wig excuse
me um this is a sister company to RPG
show does bag with the way it came in
and then here's the card which I'll read
off in a second of all the stuff that
we'll all the specs of this puppet and
then it came with one of these which it
believe it's two in here I didn't used
one of these already had one came with a
whole bunch of stuff
it came with a card let's see gift card
cherish with coupon cherish save $12 off
plus wicked expiration date is August
1st 2017
so it's cherish is the just happy oh
it's there this is their one-year
anniversary so that's why they're giving
me all of this good stuff so this is
Doge well thanks I'll make sure I use
that code cherish okay so now to the
specs this wig is is called this is the
Malaysian human hair Bob with sweat bang
it is a hair color as a natural color if
the length is 12 inches in the front 10
inches in the back lace color is a light
brown my cap size the one my wig cap
colors are a brown and my cap
construction is a glueless lace cap I
however went ahead and used my guys to
be glued in
my whole unit down so yeah the puppy
ain't moving nowhere and um I did that
as you see here like all of this is not
mine I think this is mine but all of
this isn't so I get closer he can see
I'm coming
you see so none of this is mine like
none of it that's lace that's so you can
see there's lace here lace I got a
little makeup and I felt like it helped
a little bit make so yeah I don't have
any hero what when I seen the wig it was
a picture of the wig on a mannequin
which had no life to it and then I
actually seeing some customers had
purchased the wig and I was ok I could I
could I could work with this but the
problem that I felt is that it's just
it's way too much hair on this side
versus the amount of hair that's on this
side so what I'm gonna have her do is
I'm gonna have her I'm having a cut like
the top into like a pixie and well the
tops on the side so I think I'm gonna
make her make the sides just as short as
this cut this down and then we're gonna
kind of do a pixie here at the top um
just like I want like uh a James Dean
situation popping up that's what I'm
feeling right now okay my experience
with this week has been very great I
will say that um I have got no shedding
of the the density which it didn't stay
in there how much density was in this
wig but I will say that the density is
quite a realistic for the length of this
unit the lustre and his hair is the
natural luster that it came with um when
I received my way however a distinct um
so okay sent it on um I did bleach the
knots of this week since this my part I
did reach the not only because I felt
like if I didn't then my life was going
to be a little bit on the when you get
light brown or brown lace sometimes it
doesn't always match your skin tone
perfectly but I know if you go ahead and
bleach your nuts the lace usually turns
like more of a brownish color which for
some people that's a problem but for me
is perfect because they
matches my skin tone as you can see very
very very very well like I me like this
much of it gone and then this is one of
these you know we can do something a
little bit funky but I just need
something that's not so blunt and yeah
so she's on our way right now I'm just
gonna come and cut it for me so I can
have more of a style that I'm in love
with because the problem is I can't do
anything with this that's the thing it's
this and because there's such a big
length on each side specially how short
this is as opposed to how long this is I
can just simply take it and put a curl
right here like this and you know it'll
be this but how many times have I or
anybody else have done this style and
you just get so boring after a while
this yeah so um I'm gonna I'm trying to
find the plate to see if I'm gonna have
her we're gonna record her cutting it or
not I don't know we're just gonna see
how it works out but I will say the hair
is very soft it kept and softness even
after the three washes I put it through
because of the smell that they sent it
in and like I said no shedding the lace
it feels really great the there's a cone
here in the back which goes up under
your braids or whatever however there's
adjustable strap here in the back which
is great because it made this all unit
fit very snug so when I was going ahead
and using the gaas to be glued it was
easy cuz they laid down where I needed
to lay and I told you it is not my
favorite that's just the only thing I
think if I could spell it different it's
just really not my favorite but it did
do definitely uh give me the ability to
go ahead and lay this whole down that's
what it did do so if you guys are
interested in my first week guys click
the links below - for that it is their
one-year anniversary so they're having
all types of sales of some sort so you
guys can get you guys a good deal on a
nice lace wig and I will say this wig
isn't it was very well constructed and
um it's not too thick but it definitely
isn't too thin so check them out and I
will catch y'all in
yeah
all the time
wait
would be taken away
don't try to handle it home
okay guys so this is the end result I
will not take my hat off because I don't
have any pomade mushy texture at the
back a whole lot and I feel like it were
furlong in a terminator - you know I
feel like a Ken doll that's what I'm
feeling like right now boom but it
definitely changed my entire um vibe
that's why I changed my clothes but it
definitely changed everything but she
did a great job with what I was given
and I love it I love it a lot so I'll
come back to you guys um in a separate
video about just how I'm styling it and
that whole thing because I've always
wanted a short a short cut but I wanted
with lace so that I could put a part in
it if I wanted to and like really slick
it down because when you buy wigs that
are shorter the problem that you usually
have is the fact that it's all there
tracks look like a 27-piece so you don't
have a chance to kind of manipulate the
hair like you want to because you're
only limited to the tractor in and it's
pretty much in a style with this I could
put a still put apart anywhere because
it was a full what was it is a full lace
wig all over and again I use the gusts
to be glued on my hairline to keep all
of this data that out alright guys peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
