like six months that's what I was
thinking I have been on this great
journey in life like you know what you
know you go through things in life and
you start to feel like when the hell is
my turn gonna come or when it's
something gonna change or when am I
gonna be able to do this and do that at
art when is something gonna just can a
bitch get a break you know you feel like
that um I went through that for a long
period of time that's kind of why I
stopped doing videos for a little bit
because I just didn't have the passion
or the one or the the need I guess you
could say to do it and because you can't
really give advice to other people if
you're not either taking it yourself or
you just don't want to necessarily you
you're not in the mood to try to help
someone else out where you're in a
jacked-up situation whether it be
emotionally financially whatever
whatever one thing that I always try to
make clear to people who watch my videos
is that I make receipt receive free hair
or free clothes or things like that from
different companies and stuff like that
it does not change the fact that I'm
human and at times I do go through
things go through things what is wrong
go through things I'm not getting in
that out you know no matter what it may
possibly be it we all go through stuff
and I think people forget that you may
be going through the same thing that I'm
going through I may be dealing with the
same thing that you're dealing with you
know and I asked why I try to keep
myself as grounded as I possibly can in
reality with doing YouTube because
people forget that they'll see you with
the celebrity or you have a celebrity
friend or you talk to somebody on
Twitter and they they automatically say
you're like them I look at you as better
then and it's like chick I'm just like
you you know I'm saying I get tired I'll
go through things my heart's been broken
I've dealt with this I had on my knee I
do you know saying it's just different
things it's all in how you come
and since I've came out of everything
that I was going through I feel like
such a new better person in general and
there's still obstacles that I want to
go through there's still things in life
that I want to conquer but I feel like
at this particular point in time in my
life I am happier and I just want to say
to everybody who's watching is you
cannot give up on what you truly want to
do in life no matter your age your
gender your transgender your no matter
what you're going through
don't let a person beat you down to the
point where you feel or a situation or
life or whatever the hell you're going
through beat you down - it takes away
that one thing that one spark that made
you happy because when your happiness is
gone it's like your soul is black and
you become bitter I know so many people
who now feel like I don't think that's
tangible because I try to do it and
didn't work and it's like that's because
your circumstances but you allows your
circumstances to be something that did
not allow you to grow and progress you
can't always run when it gets tough you
can't always quit when you want to say
uncle like you can't always do that
because what ends up happening
especially to you and in any life is
that you go through life believing
that's how it's supposed to be there are
so many people I know that look at my
life and say I can't believe that you're
only this age and you conquered this is
that in the other you know and that's
because I didn't let no I'm not letting
nothing holding me back every
opportunity that I get that I feel is
good for me I take it and whether I'm
supposed to be there or not I'm always
gonna learn in life that these things
may not be for me at the moment but that
doesn't mean that they're not for me
ever you know sometimes you you will say
you will meet somebody that tells you no
that's just life and then a note doesn't
mean no forever it means knowing the
moment the case in point I posted on
Instagram
our world Twitter that I have been
contacted by a major network which was
great I was excited then some things
kind of it didn't it didn't work out for
the moment that doesn't mean they said
no forever
it's just that in that moment that was
not what it was supposed to be I'm not
I'm not sad about it it would have been
nice but I'm not sad about it I'm not
gonna stop doing this I'm not gonna stop
my life I'm not gonna be upset and
bitter at this network because of this
they contacted me I was minding my own
business but it doesn't mean that I'm
mad about it it's life and I think
that's what people have to do everything
less especially a lot of people they are
always told yes yes about this yes about
that
your mommy told you yes your granny
tells you yes your boyfriend tells you
yes your girlfriend says yes and when
somebody told you no it's like somebody
just snatched the soul out your body you
have to learn that rejection as part of
life and you become more grateful for
things after you have conquered them and
you do get a yes after all of those
knows it means something now when you
already are always told yes the rest of
your life that you don't feel you
just like because I was supposed to get
it that's what I was supposed to do this
is my life people always told me yes you
can't go through life like that because
if your family's doing that to you then
when you hit the real world it's gonna
hit your ass like a ton of bricks you're
gonna be hurt you're gonna be crying
you're gonna be in your feelings and
that's why I see people a lot of people
on Twitter when they talk about so gay
people are not meant to do this black
people are not meant to do that
so I'm so not who the told you that
 do you think that Oprah Winfrey
went around talking about some because
I'm black I won't be able to have my own
network
do you read that she thought about that
do you think she I will never be a
successful black talk-show host because
there are none on TV that are successful
do you think she went in thinking like
that because when you think negatively
negative is gonna happen to you
you're never gonna prosper because
you're allowing yourself to not grow as
an individual because the that you
people rather is people put it in your
head your community or just in general
you believe it that's what you're gonna
do you're never gonna meet reach
highest potential if you continue to put
yourself down if I go around saying
because gay people haven't conquered
this and they have been conquered and
you've never seen an androgynous person
on TV with the network or a show based
around them then it's never gonna happen
then I'm never gonna be I'm gonna
be that fool from YouTube that just was
doing videos that's what I'm gonna you
know I'm saying if I don't want to go
off and become something more because
you have to start from here it would I
would feel like I cheated child if I
don't go forward and try and be better
than this and I'm saying that this is
better I will ever stop this but I want
to grow and be able to go forward with
this and make it into something that you
guys can fit at home on your TVs and
watch and y'all can DVR you know I'm
saying it's it's a journey for everyone
and I think that when you are around
negative people and you let negative
things get into your mind and you don't
believe and you start to forget about
what your passion was then you're gonna
look back in 20 30 years and be like so
I did nothing absolutely nothing and
look Ryan I'm working at a dead-end job
I don't want it I'm making decent money
but you sit back I don't ever want to be
one of those people who sits back and
things what would have happened if I
would've did that what would have
happened if I took that opportunity what
would have happened if I would have took
that leap of faith I'll never want to be
that person and you shouldn't either you
never want to have a what if in your
life because you're never gonna know I
ready to take it and get a nose and sit
back and scared to possibly get it yes
and you have to know that so whether
your passion if you want to be an
engineer you want to be a singer now let
me say this if you're asking sing bitch
then you need to rethink that dream
because everybody ain't Cassie okay
everybody can't get a good deal and you
know I'm saying do to do so remember
that okay I'm just saying though okay
there's there's some of y'all be
reaching and I'm not saying that you
can't reach for the stars bull's eye but
don't get your ass hit by a
 bullet trying to do the
most okay all right
for me I can do a lot I cannot sing okay
I tried it y'all know I was trying to do
the artist thing I tried it some of the
songs came out good other songs mm-hmm
so I decided to just die do that
okay I just got gonna do it and I'm fine
with that
at least I tried it though it doesn't
mean that you have that everything that
you try you got to pull out I know some
people who cannot sing and got albums
okay mixed tapes and they still trying
and I I applaud I applaud you for all of
that effort cuz your effort was great a
your singing was an f-minus
and I'm sorry about it but it is what it
is and sometimes in life you do have to
be honest with people did doesn't mean
you have to be mean to people okay there
is a difference people you can be honest
don't be rude and I'm a
 ass can't sing bitch you
do oh my god my ears my drums like
that's just being you just used to doing
the most cuz I can tell you something
about your I off a bit
shall we
oh my god show tracks no edges but I
don't want to do that that's cuz what is
that done to you no well you can't beat
people down you got to help people out
sometimes in life you gotta be bueno so
don't give up on your dreams you guys
don't don't ever quit sometimes you can
take a break just make sure if you gonna
take that break make sure you that type
of bitch they pick it back up just some
of y'all will a brick mean I'm done okay
you know you go exercise and even though
I need a break and you sit there and
sweat it dries up and you drink the
water and you really should I'm ready to
go no no you gotta keep going okay cuz
if you don't keep going eventually there
will never be another chance you don't
don't ever pass up a chance to do
something great because you only get one
chance and if you pass it up sometimes
you never get that opportunity again
ever
you don't want to be telling your kids
these stories you know momma could have
been the next beyoncé but I decided to
be with show daddy because he wasn't
 and he was locked up nigga I'm
gonna uh-oh all across the stage
and I seen you last a care
package like Uncle top of that so
no and don't let nobody else sway you to
believe that you can't do it especially
when you've been told by people who know
what the they talking about that
you can do it
don't let that raggedy come
up in here talking about something well
I'm my cousin tried and it wasn't all
the yo cousin I ain't that bitch
so therefore what you're gonna do is get
the about my face and you won't let
me do with the if you wanna rock
wit me didn't make sure you rock with me
don't start rocking with me when the
money come in and I'm on TV now all of a
sudden you believe didn't mean you knew
I could do it those type of people cut
at the knees
cut them good at cutting clean cuz ain't
 and they don't believe in you they
just want you around because your your
convenient you don't want to be a
convenience to anyone okay so on that
note don't give up on your dreams be
happy be healthy and with things in life
come to you especially negative things
that try to deteriorate I could put it I
just just beat you down
don't let it do it fight the back
do not let life get ahold of you cuz
when I get a hold of those drawers and
they start pulling them up your ass
that's what people start to go rogue and
they just they just go all off and it's
hard to get you back don't even get to
that point keep your drawers in check
you build on tight and make sure that
you just get through life the best way
that you can no matter what it is don't
quit cuz once you quit it may be over
try it into the wheels
fall off and I mean that try it
now don't be sixty trying to thing inch
don't girl no miss Billie Holiday no but
that doesn't mean that you can't be you
can't still enjoy your passion you can
still sing you just don't have to be a
singer you don't have to be a artist
that's the difference you know you can
still live out your dreams and just
doesn't have to necessarily be as an
artist you know so yeah I love you guys
and I'll talk to you guys later
and I hope you guys are safe and sound
and yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
