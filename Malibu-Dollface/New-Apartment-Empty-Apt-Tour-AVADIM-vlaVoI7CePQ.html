haven't moved in yet because just to
give y'all overview before I start
putting stuff in so this is obviously
the front door this is the kitchen
um so this is the nice brown white
contrast of a on so the floors it's a B
word is an idea which you're gonna
pretty much play and then they'll be
photos all on this wall so this is what
the flooring looks like which I'm happy
is all harmful I think tape provides
fireplace TVs gonna go there um I've
seen ursua see I don't know which
bedroom is gonna be which so yeah so
this is gonna probably be the room that
I do my youtube videos in only because
it's a smaller room than the other one
I'm still like so we're gonna take this
good ol shade out I thought it went down
but understand alright so yeah it's nice
and shady in here so then I have an
extra clever closet which run out of
space okay so I have this one which is
gonna do come out I'm gonna be a big mug
closet for all my mosquito uh stuff
pretty much and then this side of the
flaws it will be pretty much drink is
like total pay for all of this extra
stuff that I need the dog stuff to the
my own apartment this is pretty much
what I use the section for um this is
the bathroom I'm gonna change the
showerhead although this one
nice of my hands like the extra nozzle
that I use for the actual dog so this is
what I'm looking like today hey I got my
Rihanna creepers yesterday so just to be
for the towels this is the thing which
is not and then these are the cabins
which are really nice up with the clean
stuff down there then I have which one
is this dryer so dryer and then I have
the washer and these are the smaller
ones however in the units like my actual
apartment
we have like washrooms that we use that
we can go to as well if we um need to
draw meeting to wash like our comforters
and stuff okay so turn this off so these
are my glass like stainless foggy doors
so let's see this is just the extra
section if I want to put something in
here which I probably will put like
laundry stuff like my dirty clothes
hamper or go in here and stuff like that
to keep it out in the bathroom
alright so I like these little knobs
alright so this is the second room which
will probably be my bedroom not sure but
this is my second room and I like this
nice carpeting a new dog solid and then
we have the my closet closet which all
like currently I have like my Barbie
stuff up here like Barbie cars and stuff
like that we have these and then
we have hangers I mean hangers here and
hangers there hangers there and then I'm
gonna probably put another makeshift
shelf in there by like you know those
ideas laws that you can Bob doesn't know
we're closed then they're permitting me
to have this right now so from here you
can see to the kitchen and then this is
gonna be my bathroom probably so um yeah
looks like this and it's a nice
beautiful countess darling you have this
towel which I really like and then again
under the cabinet for the cleaning stuff
this will be uh probably not my bathroom
now think about it's probably the guest
bathroom because it's closer to the
front door so I don't think I want to be
that rough underwear the bathroom again
I'm gonna change the showerhead this
then we have this extra closet which is
like the most opera leachate Closet in
the world
bleh this will be like for people's coat
and just bottom upon my what's the name
box in here my iMac bar um and yeah so
kitchen

my seasonings and goodies and all the
 that I up in here
okay then we have uh I'll go put dishes
in there that's whole thing as well as
this one do you do do do do and then you
have a thought and then we have the
preacher the freezer the freezer and
the refrigerator so I'll have a shitload
of popsicles in the freezer because you

just have this area
I like the stove I like these drawers
cuz they saw clothes and then you have
these down there and then we just have
the sink which is a deep s compared to
my other one Plus this get out a nozzle
like such so yes even though I don't
like to wash dishes so we'll be using
the dishwasher and yes I only do the
dishwasher on peak hours like they tell
you to on of water and power
so yeah this would be Ritchie's just so
we have that and then I have the balcony

we have the balcony here which is where
the dogs will go the morning so
from the guests so they'll have time to
run out here and play and drunk on that
whole thing so I'm moving well yeah now

daunting task of actually moving on my
