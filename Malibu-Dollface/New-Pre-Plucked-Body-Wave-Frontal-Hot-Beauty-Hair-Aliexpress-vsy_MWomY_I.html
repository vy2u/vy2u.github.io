eyes take a fly that car is bad little
weight now you've gone yes I gotta leave
you alone
okay so I'm excited because it's
something new so you guys know when it's
something new I get really excited okay
can you believe that I ain't got no hair
out whatsoever and it's one good I don't
have not one elastic strap and this
hairs really bad okay so we don't get to
it this review is for our hot Beauty
hair okay so they contacted me and was
like um would you like to do another
review and if you do would you Ramon
would you mind um reviewing our body
weight here y'all know how I feel I'm so
over body wave and I'm like no no we um
we have some new body weight here once
you do like a different length but we
have new frontals that are already plugs
now I got the emails to prove that they
said they was already plug so if any of
you ordered this hair in this front tool
and you do not have a plug hair line
please let me know anyway back to my
point so I'm like okay so they send me a
picture it looks great and I know a lot
of you guys um I'm gonna be like you
know I don't really know how to plug our
over plug once you ever plug is it's a
Reb you ain't getting that internet so
what can I do this is gonna help y'all
out okay so I did go ahead and bleach
the knots on this because they do not
send it with bleach night so I had to do
that myself but BAE BAE baby okay so my
lace is right here okay oh oh okay so so
what I did was I went ahead and I
bleached my nights okay and I should
have it should be a video up by now I
don't know when you guys can get this
but it should be a video up now needs
one a tutorial on how I make wigs so it
shows you the bleaching process and that
so I bleached the not what I purposely
did was the baby hairs that were in the
front of the frontal I purposely let
them get blonde okay now a lot of you
guys don't really know much about the
way that real hair works even though you
have
yeah you really don't mean never really
look at your follicles most of our most
all of our follicles that are about a
half an inch from like growing out from
our scalp are usually transparent
they're not black so usually when you
and I don't mean like is blue it's very
little that is black so when you pull a
hair out you usually see the ends of it
and usually sometimes they be white or
sometimes they be clear just depending
um so when you look at someone's head or
you park someone's hair like such if
it's just black right here it's gonna
look weird so that's why we bleach nuts
I don't think people understood that so
I went ahead and did it and I left a
little bit as you guys see my like the
close-up a little bit of my not um in
the front I left them a little bit over
bleach on purpose
because I wanted you guys to see how it
looks look at that okay
so I'll do tutorial on how I did this
and I use no glue I don't even have an
elastic band like I said and it's no
tape I can take it off I'm have edges
and for those who have low for hips like
myself this is perfect it's gonna work
wonders okay I promise I'm gonna do it
this weekend I promise uh whenever y'all
get this if it's going if you watching
it now this weekend I'm probably better
Saturday so that you watching is
whatever okay so so the hair this is the
mess that I made when I did it so all my
limbs all right here so I have a 22 I do
not remember I've had this wig for a
4-minute so I've been wearing this puppy
out okay so excuse my body weight
because it ain't all as body weight ish
as it could be I washed it in a minute
okay so that's a 22 or 22 you only got
three bundles in this one I want to say
yeah this feels a little not as full as
I'm used to but it's really cool so they
sent me 322 and they send me a 22 inch
frontal to match as well and this hair I
wouldn't say it's anything different
from any other body wave hair that I've
had but the frontal baby
the frontal necklace okay so um this is
what it looks like pretty much I've had
this hair I have this hair before I
moved matter of fact because my older
dress is on that box um so that kind of
I've been moved for over a month now so
when I received the hair usually what I
do is when I first get hair I will um go
ahead and make the wig and then it gives
me a chance to kind of rotate it with
probably like I usually do like two two
or three at a time within a two week
span so I use the row every day it's a
different wig so I just go ahead and I
rotate em I rotate it rotate them and
this one I kept coming back to but I
hadn't got to the point yet where I
tried this method in the front um to
give my lace to lay down like such and
so flesh looks so realistic you know um
so probably about so like two weeks ago
decided to try something a little bit
different and baby when I'm - you just
work number two do this on normal eggs
but I will say that the frontal has
99.99999% to do with it I'll put a
picture up here of what it looked like
when I first got I believe this is mines
that they sent me and I won't say one
thing about how beauty hair they do pay
attention to what's trending at the
moment and a lot of these companies are
just getting on a gravy train of
frontals but also pluck frontals because
what is what I don't think what a lot of
people understand about when you get a
plug frontal it can make or break your
install most of us want a flawless
install so when you do do your hair is I
would love if every company came with
pluck nuts
I mean pluck frontals why not I think
that's the best option because it's less
work for the consumer to have to do when
you have to do all of that it kind of
takes away from the fact that it was a
cheaper price you know so I think stop
it so I think not I'm starting to
realize like yo this is what's in so
they always even when the ombre hair was
really popping they were on it now these
hot Beauty hair you get an A plus plus
plus plus
plus plus but you get a minus because
she was getting on my nerves
they hounded me like crazy about this
review and I kept telling them give me a
chance give me a chance I did I'm
testing out you know my testing process
sometimes depending on what the Harris
is extensive straight hair usually tells
me off the bat what it's going to do
hair with some texture to it takes a
little bit longer because you got to do
it in the elements our board is Harold
jargon our rotors I wear this hair
runnin
I wore this hair everywhere and I'm
still good I've had no issues with
shedding thank God because I just sent
back to things of hair which I was
shedding terribly um so no issues with
shaking it lays so good the density I do
not know what the density of this
frontal is you have the extranet because
I don't think that gave me that
information
it lays so flawlessly so effortlessly I
could walk somewhere nobody would even
know that I had on a frontal you know so
yes I cannot what I'm excited about this
tutorial because I know for a lot of us
low hairline folks we cannot do the
Nicki Minaj and cheat it down to the
forehead so I have another option I hope
you guys enjoyed this video if you guys
are looking for this particular look
again hop beauty hair is selling
frontals all right deep plug so I will
put that specific link at the bottom
okay this hair that I'm wearing is their
Brazilian body wave this is three
bundles not four but three bundles so

see three bundles of 22 inches
