someone my new puppy Richie Rich so your
pumpkin so you guys know it's been about
I think the Noddy is I think she's seven
months now seven or eight months now um
but I'm gonna do an update video with
her because a lot of you guys probably
don't know but she actually broke her
front leg like three months ago when she
got it off leg she had it on for like
six to eight weeks pretty much but we'll
talk about that and imma do a story time
so but since the knotty
is so small still she's got a little bit
bigger since the last time y'all seen
everybody still really strong um she has
been one of those dogs that has so much
energy and when I have to do things like
this work she just wants to play so why
not give her a little brother so she
hasn't met him yet so it's gonna be
interesting so I just wanted to give her
another little brother and a campaign
who she could play with and so I'm sure
they're gonna have fun cuz they should
be around the same size fully grown so
nothing's officially I think stopped
growing and she's not yet the doctor
said it should be like a month from now
she's a machine you're gonna more bigger
than with years now and when I first got
her I got her at 4 weeks and she was
this size so he's eight in the half
weeks because he was born on October
27th and he's a Pomeranian um and he is
currently I think a pound and he has
this nice beautiful fur so precious uh
you guys know um my car is this color so
I always wanted a dog that match my car
because I like you know soft clothes
like white and stuff like that so I
thought he would be a perfect addition
to our family so now I have my two
children and I think it's not he's gonna
like him I think she likes other dog she
just so used to being the only dog at
home so I will give you guys an update
when I
I've been on her and when she broke her
leg I'll let you guys know how the
meeting between the two of them went but
so far so good he's definitely different
from her when I first got her she was
trying to eat my face and all types of
stuff he's been very very chilled like
he's got a very calming personality and
they say usually with dogs and usually
children uh if you have a boy and a girl
it's usually one of the other the yin
and yang so so far so good he does whine
because he likes to have a lot of
attention so that reminds me of his
sister a whole lot he's got his I
brought him the same color the Louie
Vuitton color that zanotti has so they
can have matching ones and then um I
have the Louboutin carrier but he's
currently sleeping in because he doesn't
like the bed but he likes the carry I
guess because it's like narrow but they
both can fit in it and the luggage tags
I haven't got them hot stamp yet so I
have two of them I brought an additional
one and then I have the one that came
with the Louboutin carrier and I guess
we were time I've never done it I think
I did it love one time with a wallet and
it's like a courtesy thing where they
just cannot stamp your initials on to
stuff that you want so it's it's this
right here so yeah I'm just it's two of
these and then I'm gonna get his
initials put on it and then I'm gonna
get her initials put on the other one so
that they can roll together and then
right now it's just toys in um all cuyps
of doggie stuff in here so that he can
feel comfortable because he really likes
i'm sorry babes oh you'll get used to it
than I did um he currently just likes I
guess the comfort of it he brought it I
got my brand-new bed and he just he's
not really feeling it so nothing on the
other hand when I first got her sheet
that's all she wanted to do was sleep in
the bed he sleeps eats poops sleeps eats
poops peace and that's pretty much it
cuz he is still very small and I
remember when she used to do this now
she just drives him crazy but I love her
um so yeah I'll give you guys an update
but I did want to come to you guys and
show you guys my new little pumpkin he
just looked like a puff he actually
looks like food the little palm that I
got from my
keys hey yo Michael Kors is having a
sale when you use just so you know um
but yeah he reminds me of this very much
um so I got my little teddy bear dog and
then my light one and then I got my cute
little girl um
the naughty is like brown and red now
she's changed colors like crazy but I
hope you guys have a beautiful Christmas
and I will catch you guys in the next
