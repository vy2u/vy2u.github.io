being a dog a lot of you guys wanted me
to kind of doing a QA about her and how
was for me to have a puppy now so she is
now eight weeks
no she's six weeks old now and I get a
lot of questions when I post pictures of
her Instagram what kind of breed of dog
is she and this is that in the third so
she's actually a shih tzu and a Maltese
so she's a mixed I don't know like I
said in my initial video when I got from
my update video I don't know which one
is which what the mom was the Maltese or
the I don't know what did their
temperaments um she's actually very very
very excited she's loves to play
she's very hyper um she I call her my
little tomboy because she's so not a
girly girl she likes everything like
yeah she's really rough and I have a
platform bed so you guys know my bed is
like really high off the ground because
she's so small still she still tries to
get up there she's hit her head she's
failed she's done all types of things um
so she's very very very rough from what
the vet told me because I was asking her
when I went so we went the other day was
today Monday we went Saturday for her
shots and when we went I was asking the
vet I said why is her muzzle right here
changing colors and her Paul's getting
brown and she told me she said is
because puppies shed their puppy here so
she might end up being the color of
prowler she might be like that color
um versus the black that she was in the
initial video that I had when I first
got her so that's cool with me I told
myself when I was getting a dog I said
either I want them to be Brown I want
them to be black or white and she was
black but she will probably end up being
brown she has like a brown hue to her
she's not exactly black black but um
yeah so so far she has three bids she
has this is cute I found it at a brawl
this is a tea bower bed and it was it's
bigger than her of course but I wanted
her to have an extra bed to have in my
car because she's so small then when we
do like go riding and stuff like that
around town she slips in slide cuz I
have liver seats so I decided to get her
that bed for as her car seat so she has
that and she has two bits from I forgot
the name of the company but most of her
stuff that I have gotten for her since
she's since I've had her has been from
that company um the doctor when she got
a clean bill of health
she's fine she's healthy she's doing
everything that she's supposed to do she
matches my hair and she's a bundle of
joy I really love her and the lady that
I got her from was actually a neighbor
of mines before I moved and her dog had
a litter of puppies and she was like um
I really need to I would see the dogs
but I couldn't tell which one was which
I just knew one was a Maltese and one
was the too
but she said I can't take care of all of
them right now and I need to get rid of
them and so instead of selling them she
just gave her to me so she was free um
but she's a bundle of joy is that the
thing is being a puppy owner and having
a dog is very different especially for
somebody like myself because it was all
about just me and then I got hurt and I
remember the first week I got her y'all
I'm not gonna lie I was having the puppy
blues I was like I don't know if I'm
gonna keep her because this is a lot of
work it's like having a infant she cries
she needs to go out to poop and she
can't go outside right now to go walking
because she's too smart she hasn't got
her vaccinations yet so she goes stir
crazy in a house because she's just
sitting there all day now when I first
got her she was just in her bed and she
was in my room then one day I woke up
and she was chewing on the though one of
the spikes on my Louboutins and I was
gonna make her into a little bit um
Freddie flat because she was about to
get it so I had to go and buy her a um a
crate to put her in and the first day
she got it she hated it
but now she knows where I told her to go
get in her bed she knows where it is she
has another bed that I just set out in
the
living room itself so that she can kind
of just say when I'm watching TV or I'm
cooking or something she can be kind of
part of the entire moment she doesn't
feel like she's left out but I would
suggest to people who are getting
puppies and stuff like that crate
trained them first because if they get
used to it in a Nolan Aaron time out
where to go then they have a better
result especially with potty training
and that's the next thing I have so many
pped pads so not even funny Petco and
Petsmart have become my best friends
since I've had her because you know I go
there to get everything for her that is
conducive to puppies don't bite my chain
so it's just little stuff like that but
to having a dog it's a lot of
responsibility and at first because I've
never owned a dog on my own I've always
had friends who have had dogs my little
sister had when we were younger we've
had family friends with dogs but I've
never had my own personal when I've
always want anyone but I've never had
the chance so I didn't understand how
much work it went into and how much you
have to if you're a person who thinks
everything is gross don't get a dog
because between ticks fleas and species
you're gonna freak out okay when I first
seen when I got hurt I don't know how
the living environments were for her
when they were keeping her but she had
like two ticks on her and I don't know
what it was and then I seen one leg in
her bed and I freaked out and that's
what that was and I was going for the
puppy blues and I was just like I don't
want to deal with this but now stuff
like that doesn't bother me and she
doesn't have any now they took them all
off and then she has like the little
puppy stuff that goes on so she would
prevent her from getting anything like
that um so yeah I actually got people
were also asking this you have health
insurance and I did actually got it
through Pet Smart they have the Banfield
hospital for dogs and puppies and I got
hers so that whenever she needs like her
vaccinations dewormed all of that stuff
they call me to tell me to come in when
the do it because I don't know anything
about that so I think it's like $36 a
month because
still a puppy and I think goes it's like
$50 a month or whatever when she gets a
little bit older but it works it's worth
every penny because if you get a dog
whether you get them for free or you pay
for them you don't want them to die and
you don't want them to die of a sickness
that it's not necessary because I know
my uncle had two Pomeranians and one of
them ate another dog's poop because they
were not vaccinated in they died so yeah
if you have to take care of the monkey
we'll take care of yourself they have to
go to the doctor in a hospital just like
you to get their stuff so if you're
gonna invest in a puppy make sure that
you have money because everything from
food to beds to just a towel you know it
comes up to a nice pretty penny Hartz
snacks cost so if you guys are looking
into getting a puppy make sure that you
know that it's a lot of work and you
can't you can't be eating my weave but
you can't let leave them alone because I
work from home
I don't we spend a lot of time together
you know but we have we bond but you
don't want to get a dog anew you go to
Vegas the next day or you leave them you
know and you like the dog doesn't even
get to know you because especially when
they're this small I should have got her
I should have just got her but I got her
at 4 weeks when I should I got alright
six weeks so you know it's been a while
since we've had to bond and she's doing
from her mom so she feels like I'm her
mom so when I leave the room she does
like to cry or things like that or she
know my sleeve she doesn't like if I can
take her with me but I have a tendency
to take her out with me as far as
running errands because she has a
carrier but no walking and no you know
none of that not yet she has her harness
coming so that I could give her a walk
and then we went to Louboutin the other
day and I got her collar which is it has
the Olsen honey that was my lip it has
the LV if you can't see cuz she won't
put her head down it has the LV logo on
it Indian has the monogrammed Louboutin
is still a little big for her because
she's so small still and then it has the
charm here that has Lou Vuitton on this
side and then you get all her
information and great but because
Louboutin is
do it at the store I have to go
somewhere else and get it engraved for
her with her name my information on it
so that if she ever gets lost with the
highly doubt cuz she's always with me
but you never know that's what tags and
collars and suffer for and she have
another one it's like her walking collar
that has her name one and I got it done
they're like the little Pet Smart thing
because I don't hurt her ruling this one
because it was not cheap so I don't want
her to mess it up or ruin it so this is
kind of like when we go out but if you
lock for walks and stuff like that I'm
just gonna give her a regular one and
she can tear apart and do what she
wanted she'll be alright but yeah that's
I think that's everything that people
have asked me how Oh any questions
before I go that I give about her is how
big will she get um the doctor told me
that she should only get like I think
right now she's like 2 pounds I think
she just hit 2 pounds but um she says
she'll probably 3 pounds max so she's
not gonna get any bigger than this and
you notice how she's got a little bit
bigger since I first got her um but you
know that's something I kind of read
everything so yeah um I will talk to you
guys in the next one I hope you guys
enjoyed this and I'll talk to you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
