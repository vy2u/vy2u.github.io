this review somebody asked me to do this
topic which I think actually is a really
good topic and it's talked about giving
your all in a relationship and kind of
the pros and the cons that come with
that way it's just when you meet someone
new like what's the right thing to do
what's the wrong thing to do type of
situation and Hana what would be the
repercussions to certain things so um so
I'm gonna go with the cons first and
then I will go with the pros I maybe
I'll go back and forth I don't know how
this is gonna work I'll say one thing
you did not do something else so um you
know you meet someone new and then it's
like really amazing
everything is always great in the
beginning like everything is always
gonna be one less you get with a
ass but other than that everything seems
to always be like really good in the
making of the relationship but what ends
up happening is people get a little too
comfortable they start acting stupid and
disrespectful and dumb as and then
you know things kind of go wrong so
people will always be very like today
the one thing that I always hear is life
that's thirsty to be like this always
thirsty to be like that like we just not
thirsty to tell somebody how you feel
now it's thirsty if this person don't
even know that you like them and then
you come out the cut I want some you
know I really got feelings for you
 ya know but other than that you
know if you guys have like a mutual
feelings then I don't think that is ever
thirsty to tell us um I think it's more
thirsty not to tell somebody why are you
over there sitting there like you know I
like you like that's childish that's
just so chowder just let me know how to
 you feel all in this extra
that you trying to pull right now I'm
not going for it but okay
and the pros let's go with the pros
first the pros of opening and kind of I
never tell people to give their all to a
person as far as um themselves you got
to keep something for you so if you
can't always just give 100% to yourself
cuz then we do have live I mean once
your person somebody else cuz what the
 you can have for yourself but I
think
that is smart that when you start to
kind of open up to somebody and kind of
like let trust in and you kind of let
people know how you feel and stuff like
that you have to know what type of
person that you're dealing with first
because if this person let's just say
you have a track record for
dating horrible men and women let's just
say I got crazy bitches I got people
that I don't like you know I'm saying
like I just got muhfuckas I don't trust
like my whole track record with my exes
is bad then make sure that this person
is not like them so if you have a
preference let's just say your
preference are thugs you love thugs ones
with no jobs no references damn near no
money no future no car no prospects for
the rest of their life maybe it I could
be wrong but maybe this is not the
person that you should be trying to seek
out and if they are falling into the
same category then it's time for you to
look at you and think well maybe it's
time for me to kind of change the way
that I approach things also the type of
people that I'm trying to approach maybe
that could work for you because I see
all the time people say men and
women ain't it's not that it's the
men you're with eight it's
the women that you keep seeking
out and being thirsty over are the ones
that are not so those are kind of
the pros and the cons when it comes down
to kind of giving your all in the
beginning when it gets to the point
where you guys know each other you guys
have established that you guys love each
other you like each other a lot whatever
whatever then I think it's time for you
guys at some point you guys have to have
a talk and say where do you want to see
this relationship go do is this a summer
thing is just a winter thing is it's a
fall thing is this a long-term thing
where are you going because a lot of
times what I always hear is people say
well we were so I thought we were gonna
being in front of long run but he
thought it was gonna be like the lines
of communication were because
nobody came to each other and said this
is what we're gonna do everybody was
just kind of in it for the long run to
kind of see where the it was gonna
go and he obviously just went nowhere
so you don't want that to happen
that's the worst so make sure that your
lines of communication with this person
is open so that you don't get in your
feelings and they thinking it's a game
cuz then that's where you've become to
get problems and then you get bitter and
you get like no you don't want that so
communication definitely is key you have
to keep an open mind you have to keep
what you want as well as what they want
you know kind of in line so I was just
like hmm what else could be something
that I always hear people talk about and
one thing that I always hear that I
continue to keep hearing is no I'm too
good for this person or I'm the type of
person that's too good for this type of
person but like you know how perfect
example
you're not TLC although Candi wrote no
scrubs they basically did the song no
scrubs everybody that they was whit was
a scrub that was outstanding Maxine and
oh and Ray Rice and they were all scrubs
so I mean it had something but their
women had more than them type of
situations you know I'm saying so that
I'm using others analogy to say this
don't go out talking about you don't
want this you don't want that and you
 around and you get this very no
bitch that's not gonna work
it ain't gonna work like you have to
basically you hold yourself to a
standard to make sure that your standard
is being met by not only somebody else
but yourself you know you can't say what
you doing you don't want what you turn
around and you go out and get that
that's stupid that's like me saying you
know I don't really want black hair but
I sit around all day with black hair
bitch you want that cuz you ain't
did about it so when it comes down
to it make sure that the person that
you're getting with is not a repeat of
your past it's not a person that you
keep saying that you don't want to get
with but there because I mean at the end
of the day it's all about what you want
you could say all day with the you
don't want it's do you are you gonna go
and make the effort to get it people are
so afraid of change they're so afraid of
trying something different so I'm trying
something new I can tell you from
firsthand experience I have tried
especially in a dating world I try to
date different people that may think
probably wasn't my cup of tea
in the beginning but this time when
going on I figured out I got more in
common with them then my preference you
know what I'm saying and I think when
you get stuck in your preference you're
trying to get you get stuck in getting
your heart broken I just say that
anybody can't break your heart but I'm
saying you continue to have that just
that dumbass pattern of don't do
that but I will say that one of the the
pros about getting to know somebody and
giving your all to somebody if you ever
truly truly being in love you know what
that feels like and you know that when
you have a person it's hard to explain
like if you've really been in love you
to have that person by your side and to
have that person as your confidante and
somebody that you love and you care
about that cares about you and you guys
are Bonnie and Clyde and riding to the
end it's a special thing to have and
what's sad is it said that like 80% of
people never experience real love and a
lot of times I I personally believe it's
because they don't let their self they
love their so hurt like you can't let
one it up for
everybody if that was the case I'd be
one bit of mad pass fish cuz it's a
 I would love to burn down
the house I would love to burn de
 ass it's a lot of my
people that will excess we could just
say that yeah I do I just despise and
not because of what they did but a lot
of times my whole thing is how you did
it and why you did it it was so stupid
that's what pisses me off I've never
 about other it's that you
 didn't thought it was okay
you know and I'm a loyal person I am and
I'm sure a lot of you guys are the very
same way where you get with somebody and
you care about somebody there's not
nothing that they want that she won't
get them there's not nothing that they
need that she will not you know it's
it's never a too much if it's in your
reach or your your body your you know
I'm saying it's in your grasp to get
them you will get it for them whether
it's material emotional whatever you
will get that for them if you truly
truly love that person so when people do
wrongful things to you it is it sucks it
does it sucks but you cannot let
cuz it you can't let it your life I
let people I see so many people do this
I'm gonna do me I'm gonna be single I'm
not gonna do this I'm not gonna date I'm
not gonna do this I'm not gonna do that
and what ends up happening is the person
that hurts you is gonna go on and be
happy and have a great life and probably
learn from the mistakes that they made
with you and fix them for somebody else
and I know that hurts when you fixing my
 up to the point where they go out
and be the best they can be for the next
bitch you'll be like really okay that's
real cute you know good
that's why I love the song if you guys
know Jenaya Jenaya Aiko if you give you
knew her from the bouquet days then she
has a song called the worst and if you
listen to the song it is like everything
that you feel about your ex when y'all
break up if it's on bad terms like you
are the worst you wouldn't
 until I got with show ass so I hope
you know that like it's that type of
song that's why I love it like that
was playing before I started doing this
video so I mean I'm good now but you
know I'm saying I just still I still
reminisce sometimes but um yeah you just
can't let it cuz they're gonna go off
and be happy and you're gonna be bitter
about something that happened so long
ago
you don't let so many people just pass
you by that wanting to actually do good
for you in life it's about taking
chances and sometimes every time you get
with somebody you get with a situation
or you give what a dude or you get with
a chick you're taking a chance of
getting hurt and it's up to you to learn
from each situation and know that it's
not a mistake and learn that I'm not
gonna do with this one boo-boo that I
did with the last one I'm not gonna let
this person get away with I let the last
one give way that's how you learn it's
not gonna all like people want a fairy
tale they want to meet one person one
time and it's gonna be everything that
it is you don't learn that way I've
become a better person and I've
understood people are way more because I
have been hurt by people that I've loved
and I've cared about I'm not gonna even
lie to you some people have done me the
dirtiest and to this very day I can I
have no hate in my heart towards them
and you have to learn that in life you
can't have hate and hold like that
because it causes one it causes
cancer it causes you to become a better
person if because you'd become just a
bitter spirit nobody want to be around a
bitter ass bitch that's what Kenya asked
can you morning kind of friends that's
why happy these bitches on Instagram are
always on Instagram and they're always
on uhm Twitter and always on Facebook
making these statuses because no one
wants to sit back and listen to why you
did this and why you heard Oh Dante did
this Oh DeAndre did that oh my god
Braylon did this oh my god Tanisha did
that oh my god she's such a bitch oh my
god Ramona Ramona really but you know
what the I mean you know I'm where
I'm hitting it okay you just cannot do
that so when you get with somebody just
kind of way out the things that wouldn't
you what do you what do you see coming
from this what adds just that what
they talking about right now what do you
as a person as Keshia chante as Darrell
as I gotta get out like ghetto names um
you know what I mean though as you what
do you want to see come from this and
you when you finally figure out what you
want do you ask they ask what they want
and if you guys can't see eye-to-eye or
you can't see it growing into something
to be much better than it's time to go
it's time to be friends it's not worth
it anymore
stop wasting your time for my father's
that you know it's not gonna work out
for now if you want to waste your time
bitch do as you please however
don't get on Twitter and
Instagram complaining about how this is
my ain't this and this
 ain't that cuz you knew
damn well bitch when he told you as she
was a nothing but a mother jump
off the you should have took that
with a grain of salt pull down your
panties and did to do and took your ass
home but don't get all up in your
feelings talking about something he was
this and he led me bitch ain't nobody
led you on and somebody told us
point-blank to the period
that it wasn't that and that's what I
got to get out of stop thinking that you
could change my focus to be what you
want to be if you think he defined this
 in the world and he gonna
do this and he put it down like no like
James Brown that don't mean that he the
 foot your ass that's what
you gotta understand okay he if he tell
you that's not where he had in his life
and that's what he now you want to do
don't go out getting pregnant and they
get mad when you letter
no-good ass baby daddy who don't wanna
do because your ass is the one who
wanted some that was not for you
so get it through your mother
skull bitch every dude that you
with ain't gonna be Prince Charming
everybody is not you ain't Ariel and you
not gonna be dead to do from the
 Disney movie it just ain't
gonna work like that
so understand your worst understand
which one out of relationship understand
you if you don't know who you are you
cannot be in a relationship every person
is not willing to work with you to try
to help you find who you are and they're
not at that point don't try to force it
don't try to pull it on your pennies
every time you want to just cuddle and
you got to do this because you
don't want to do be upfront be honest
you you can they can only tell you yes
or no if they tell you know and they
can't rock with you either all the
that you got going on and they don't
want to go through this then you gotta
respect them for that don't hook weak
them don't be trying to be fake don't be
trying to do all that and then
you be on my crime and I'm
good
okay so just make sure you know what you
want like a clear aspect you know my
part being my hair y'all it be clean
make sure it's that clean when you make
sure your decision about what you want
in a relationship if you are not ready
to be in a relationship make sure yo
 ass ain't trying to do some
 they're trying to hurt and break
somebody hearts because it's next month
look I hate when people do that they get
in relationships with people because
I've been hurt by somebody else and then
they want to hurt somebody else cuz he
hurt people hurt people and you don't
want to get shot like that you never
saying don't play what
they heard thugs are the most sensitive
 in the world niggas with
razor blades and chicks with switch
blades your with them especially
when you sleep that's not a good look so
make sure that who you are and what you
want is very clear when you get into
relationship and if a person can take it
they can take it if they can't they
can't forget to a point in a
relationship where it doesn't work then
no just say no you're like I hate people
who always have to have a man or a woman
like they just can't never stand the
tough stand on their own two feet
