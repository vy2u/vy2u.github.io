so the dis whole video you're gonna see
that Irit a bright there on my right
coming all the way up because she was
not properly glued and or taped down
what she was but you know a day is the
day so it's just on some other stuff or
whatever so okay you see what I'm saying
today has been a day is the new day and
I'm still having the same day so I need
to go to sleep and start over but this
hair that I'm rocking right now is from
NuStar hair Amazon and it's kind of like
the same at this point I think like
Amazon Aliexpress they got a gold hand
in hand if you ask me and this is their
body wave hair that I have straightened
and curled and I'm gonna tell you why
originally this hair was 40 inches long
okay so you know how a body wave has the
S shape and it's really long they sent
me five bundles and my frontal is a 20
inch frontal that they sent me no here's
what cut their because the thing about
body wave here is that after so long you
keep washing it you keep running your
fingers to it eventually the body
worship is gonna fall out so then I
ended up with this long poof okay it was
just a super long poof and I didn't like
it so I guess because it was body wave
the ends of the hair I didn't too much
care for it so I ended up cutting it for
that reason and that reason really alone
and then I was like well I don't want to
cut it into thirty inches or 28 inches I
want to bring it back to a very nice
comparable realistic length so I know
they're like screeching right now like
did you cut it but I had to okay I'm
sorry but I had to so I'll put some
layers and it here just to give it some
body and give it some movement and that
whole thing and then I put a middle part
in and that whole thing know what I will
say about this hair that's different
from my other hair I can tell the
difference this hair definitely feels
more human-like
it feels almost human-like because I
don't believe they giving us horse here
but the other hair usually for five
bundles this hair is extremely full okay
and this was body wave here that I
straighten and then our pearl are
straightened it cut it then grilled it
but this it has more of a realistic like
my real hair feels like this you know
like it looks like this it moves like
this it has more of this you know body
to it as opposed to a lot of times I
have to manipulate my hair I have to put
a lot of parts in it and order for it to
do this effortlessly so when I received
it all of my hair had this beautiful
shape to it this beautiful wave to it I
believe I'm only wearing four and a half
bundles I didn't put on 5 any because
originally I was just gonna wear it and
then I was gonna wet it and put it in
the middle part and then just wear it
all down but baby that was not the
situation because body wave like I said
is only good for that that initial shape
when you kind of first get it after you
don't you know after you had for a while
it just kind of eventually it just
starts to look like it looks droopy and
then when it dries it looks big you know
it just kind of looks like think of like
Julia Roberts hair kind of like that but
not as curly it's much looser so if your
curls are not defined enough they start
to just look like you got a lot of hair
going on and not a lot of hair to be
dealing with when it's hot okay even
when it's cold it's just till I was like
I'm over it so it was in the middle part
and I had been wearing it for a couple
of days and I was in knot of it because
it was just so long and it was too much
of it I said well we're just gonna cut
it cuz I'm kind of over it
and I know I requested 40 inches because
that's what that sent me and that whole
thing but I had to cut baby to about
here so it's curled you know I have some
curl in it so this at this point that's
what you can tell here I was chopping
okay I was I was soft being it okay and
I cut it and cut it and kept cutting
because it was supposed to be originally
it was posed to just be straight I was
just gonna straighten it then was gonna
be long then I just was over the
straightness of it all because I have
another wig that
straighten prior to that that I like and
I was gonna use for that so I mean can
you get into this though can you get a
look though like oh girl she's late and
it's France were they sent though like I
can't take it is the front so I think is
my favorite part of the whole look I'm
beyond with you this was over it I just
wanted to do something that was simple
my Harris fell I have literally been out
all day long
it is 117 in the morning so all of the
body mists and all of the dis greatness
that I had had earlier in the day is
gone and I've had a hell of a day okay
but when I and again you know when you
have some hair to have texture to it you
ever notice that most people have like
really curly hair after often get their
ends cut because their ends look pretty
damaged that's what I was given so I had
to go ahead and put these layers and
into in order to get this or I would
have just had a lot of dead ends know
they say that this hair is 100% virgin
hair it's cut from little girls and
that's what it said anything I'm making
that up they said little girls and all
the cuticle has been put into the weft
in one direction so that well you know
come and combat shutting and tangling
which is what you always want a lot of
times you'll get hair and if you pull it
and then it do this Dana in the right
direction
remember that okay so sometimes if you
pull it in a super staticky you're
probably gonna most likely end up with
hair that is extremely extremely
difficult to keep from shedding and keep
from tangling most of all so what do I
give this hair and out of a one to ten
I'll give them a ten I don't have no
problems with it
the body wave I'm sure they're straight
here does this but for me the body wave
was just a lot I feel like if I woulda
got the body wave in this length I would
have worn in this length but like I told
you that body wave it was a lot of hair
okay
so then me to even do the perm rods
method would not have worked because I
would have been just too irritated with
riding all that hair putting all this
lot of body on it and then letting it
sit nobody wants to do that so I gave
you guys the quick to the point
situation okay that's what I gave you
just I'm more filling this think I'm
kind of getting out of the SuperDuper
crazy long hair because at this point
it's not after the 60 you girl it's not
really functional you know that's the
thing it's very difficult and it's not
as functional as you would like it to be
for the situation at him but I do like
this a lot I love this frontal I love it
I love this frontal okay girl yes come
on realness
yeah she's tented - perfect time they
told me that they're having a giveaway
okay so let me give y'all the details of
the giveaway this here can also be
bleached to a 613 and trust and believe
you know I tried it I tried the hell out
of it and it worked it is it actually
took and it didn't give me weird vibes
which is usually y'all know when you get
Aliexpress hair or Amazon here or here
for a cheaper price even if it's pack
hair like Zuri or something like that
you'll start to see or smell or see the
smoke of the smell when you start to put
your head like the bleach on it and
after about 15 minutes things start to
act real different uh-huh and I didn't
get that at all I actually got a very
even I use a little beast
but I got it even 6 13 out of this and
that's before I even toned it so you
guys do want to get some hair like this
um I would say for me I like the body
weight but like I told you body waves is
kind of a you got a wand it you got to
do that whole thing to it I like it the
straight hair so if I was y'all I would
just go ahead with Australia or I don't
know what their careers talking about I
don't even know if they have girl here
but if I was you I would definitely go
even though that's what I have walking I
think the back because I think because
my hair is body wave so the the cuticles
are more on the swollen side my hair
seems to stay like this much longer as
opposed to if my hair was just straight
I don't know how much it would it stays
like for days like this like legit like
I can just go ahead and let this fall
and do this and take it and put it on a
head and it'll be fine
usually after a while you guys know you
curl your hair and then after about mmm
a couple of days you'll see that your
hair starts to get really droopy because
of course gravity is gonna pull it down
so that's what happens but I just go
ahead I went ahead and use the bold hold
tape I didn't use the glue this time so
like this section is not glued down as
you can see it's been a long day and
then this side right here it's not but
as you can see the tape is here cuz I
just didn't feel like doing all that I
really didn't so if you keep seeing that
tab that tab is my tape okay
so I'm gonna give you guys the rules for
the giveaway um you know ain't nobody
ever said no no no fur here now it was
like this my hair goes like this because
it was supposed to be a side part so all
my layers are kind of good like this
even though I'm wearing my hair like
this I know it's weird I'm weird okay so
here the rules okay listen carefully one
follow NuStar hair bow put the links to
two different instagrams below cuz one
