my nighttime routine was so I decided to
keep the camera rolling after I finish
this video so I usually start off with
my lashes because those usually are the
most irritable for me so I like to use
these miss Regina wipes if you have
sensitive skin of any sorts don't get
the grapefruit ones because I know here
I had a little Joker Harley Quinn moment
from so it's quiet so I just use these
wipes to get as much of the makeup that
I just caked on is as much off as
possible before I move forward because
what I don't want to do is get in the
shower and while I have all this makeup
on and then just take whatever soap I
have what everybody wanted whatever and
get a cos integers isn't everything
starts to leak together and then you
still left with makeup on your face a
little do you know you kind of just
smeared it around and got some of it off
but not all of it so I like to use this
beforehand so the true me comes back
after afterwards yeah it's not it
doesn't hurt of any sort it does feel
good to have it off although I love the
way that it looks like I love makeup for
what exactly does which is you know
gives you a bit of illusion however I'm
not afraid to walk in my own skin okay
so now we're gonna check out the
contacts these are my mail contacts from
silica which I'll link below and I got
them from Lynne stop me I have another
review for some other colours that I
have coming up as well so yeah this is
just usually what I do before I get
ready for bed there's a close-up of me
taking it out and just for like a bit of
a release which is great it doesn't hurt
or anything it just feels very different
now this part is I told you guys in this
review that I put it behind my hairline
this is not heard of any sorts believe
it or not it doesn't hurt at all I just
used it to pull away from the lace but I
lose you know hair you can do it a
little bit easier and put some water but
for me I was just ready to get out of it
I just don't want my legs or the top of
my head to be wet so as you can see I'm
not bald so I like to use the Cetaphil
the Noxzema as well as the sand our
apricot scrub it depends I go back and
forth with that one or the tea tree one
it just depends on how I'm feeling this
one it has much more grit to it and
because I do have dry skin this not only
gets all the extra makeup off but it
also allows me to get the dead skin off
that comes with dry skin so that you end
up with a smooth surface when I decide I
want to go back and do my makeup again
as well as let my skin breathe
throughout the night I wear makeup
probably three times out of the week so
for the most part I don't wear this much
makeup on a regular basis unless I have
to do something like a video or go
somewhere of my off days I'm usually
just very much a bare face not even on
moisturizer so as you can see I'm
feeling more like myself at this point
so Malibu is kind of fading and pajamas
coming in so I like after I do that I
like to use this so for some people if
you do have super sensitive skin this
will burn after you just scrubbed your
face and then putting this on it will
burn for me it just helps me get all the
extra makeup off that may still be on
there and it kind of gives my skin a bit
of a smoothing the gloves that I'm using
are you get these from Target they're
like a dollar 49 but there are scrub
loves and they allow you use them I have
a pair for my body and a pair for my
face and it just it's like they like
rough and a lot of people like it a Navy
and stuff so you won't like drop your
loofah and stuff like that they use
these and it works for me or it's great
and then the next is this set of field
which is the gentle cleanser and this
just gives me just a little bit more of
a gentle feel one to kind of close
everything up and I'm cool and I'm fine
and it just smoothes out so that my face
just feels really smooth and not patchy
or any of that after I've just put all
that makeup now I just got a towel blot
here just to get myself a little bit
more I don't want to wipe the water off
I want to tell blood and I felt like I
had a little bit of eyeliner still left
and we just table like just a little bit
and then I take my Cetaphil moisturizing
cream for me this is very thick but
because
skin is dry I need it to be this thick
if you do have combination or oily skin
do not do this because you will break
out and yeah after this time for babe
hope you guys enjoy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
