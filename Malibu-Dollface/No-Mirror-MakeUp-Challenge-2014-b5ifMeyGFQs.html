little different and that's why I'm
sitting here with no makeup on hair is
pulled back this is still my 10 minute
sew-in I just gotta pull back or
whatever um because I'm gonna do a
challenge that's it's old but I wanted
to try it because I wanted to do
something a little bit different which
is the no mirror makeup challenge you
guys know when this challenge was like
really popular I didn't wear that much
makeup so it would have been pointless
you know so um what I'm gonna do is I'm
going to I have no clue where I'm
looking because I'm using like my
Riddler nikon camera so um it has no Lee
viewfinder on it so I can't see anything
okay so it's like no mirrors behind it
there's nothing so usually when I record
videos I usually record with one or two
either this iPad or this iPad depending
I've been using this one lately so for
those who wanted to know what are you
use to record your videos I use my iPad
Mini because the camera the four basic
cameras actually really goes on here um
but today I won't be using either/or
because I I can't see anything
I'm gonna do my makeup from top to
bottom and God help me I hope it looks a
little bit presentable but this is gonna
be fun why not I can always wash it off
it's just makeup okay so I'm gonna get
started and I'm gonna just go through
everything that I'm using you know
whatever and I'll edit it later so wish
me luck okay so the first thing I'm
gonna to this is just weird
the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm
using my spots primer this is the ten
dollar trouble one because Smashbox is
trippin with their prices when it comes
down to this primary it's a good primer
I will say that but the price is not
it's just it's just ridiculous I'm gonna
use my foundation and this is Iman and
it isn't clay - yeah
I want to look in the where or something
so secondary now this should be this
part should be really easy cuz you know
is just foundation I just did my makeup
so my brushes are still dirty like let
me do my makeup did a video and then
started wash my makeup off to come and
do this okay
that should be enough I think it's
blended out enough you can't see me get
the hairline you can't see nothing
I mean put some Carmack's on my lips so
that right time I get around to the
lipstick it won't be like crusty so the
next step is my concealer okay so
usually I know how to like a bump right
here
and then I have a do highlight under my
eyes
I live right here cuz I don't like on my
cheeks do you looking out hollowing
stuff right there okay so now I'm going
to take my Beauty Blender
and then I want to blend this out
it's a pretty day today though I'm
looking good at the window because I
can't I do not want to look like taraji
P Henson in that one picture
oh it's whoever said her makeup did a
arch who did your makeup today because
it looks horrendous like strike m'kay
boys like really rich give me somebody
who has vocal fry' really bad they'd be
like you know it's Jay my mom was like
what I grab there look you make me
sleep
I need this enough I feel like mom come
on I'm starting to burn so I think that
I'm good on that I'm I wish I could see
some time no I don't even know what to
do next up is usually I just look at my
damn face whatever and just so y'all
know there is no mirror in here like
there is no mirror it's just let me go
talk all the way around
alright the beginning of my eyebrows
that's right here this I'm using I'm
using my Damone Roberts pen pencil in
his car it's in Miss Ross so hopefully
this is like my favorite though I went
to demonic in my eyebrows down like
awhile ago everything
Oh God I don't have those Atlanta higher
grounds
but you feel like it's too much just
like try to blend it out No
can't even blend too much is it did I
fill it all the way also a chunky
everything
oh this is a room is I feel it I feel
like it so guys don't have just is like
really difficult they connect
it's okay because if they look at me
it's fine we're gonna clean them up
anyway what they can't see you look that
feel like it's right cuz that's usually
how doing though it's long as it's like
I hope they even my Mac concealer and NC
42 studio finish concealer and then I'm
gonna like clean up my eyebrows so they
don't look atrocious least a bit
oh but you gotta blend it out you can
put just as a primer to a Paint Pot
bitch I'm going to use my Rihanna loves
math brush I'm gonna use this healthy
glow bronzer to set my concealer which I
shoulda do five minutes ago and then I'm
gonna contour my nose so usually I come
from the eyebrow and I come powdery
I'm gonna use my Naked 3 palette just
the color limit everybody I would say
believe me I should put some fix+ on it
but it's cool oh the limit on on the lid
okay so limit lead I'm looking his mouth
so bad right now I like color it's
called black heart it's like a glittery
black ass it's not really that glittery
but it is glitter
this is the look I do only usually
luckily every day when I'm like on
Instagram I said this is the operative
picture in here about how this usually
look and you can compare Jews yeah the
Lumia I'm fallible 24 hour 12 hours
using boys um pin and I use this from a
liner so this is really gonna be
difficult
to the tail
man please take it any wing it wing
bitch
like I gotta make sure the window like I
feel like that's right I mean have a
contour cheek naturally hey it'll never
hurt to be a little more dramatic with
you I should do it I mean I'm just
blended out with a jingle behave
yourselves anyway okay
I really loves Mac blush it's in this
has a mirror on it so what I'm gonna do
the mirror is right here so what I'm
gonna do
so y'all don't think I'm cheating I'm
gonna do this like a Barbie my face is
my eye witting Wow ticket to Brazil
bronzer I love this stuff if you don't
do your makeup to light your highlight
tool I just throw this damn bronzer on
there it'll really help calm it down
just relax bitch I thought like you can
never put on enough bronzer you just
want to make a Nubian goddess make gold
on top of you I think it's Maybelline
great lash and this is in the blackest
of the black new art are you are halfway
like I usually do like it too here
because we're the rest of it we're gonna
put just the color in our tunics I'm
gonna take the blackest what is this the
black heart bling all this i'm a colo
honest muggy side
what the happened it's an emergency
my makeup looks a mess
dust is this color called dust I use
this black color and then this color and
then y'all get if y'all got the damn
college oh no Angus I'm for this I don't
do makeup through my lips it's the last
thing I'm gonna take my YSL lipstick and
it's a nude beige it's saying you know
like I think these are the moisturizing
um lipsticks but it's this color and I'm
not gonna use any liner I'm just notices
easy I can do this too mostly this is
the easiest for this whole mess
Norah's lip gloss in Turkish Delight and
we're gonna just put this on top of it
and this is the color I use them our
lips all the time your own use shadows
come on this is big enough I think I put
too much stuff cuz uh yeah
okay I think that's it I'll put the
bronzer contour everything I think I
said so what I'm gonna do is where's my
compact
mariana compact I'm going to now look at
what the hell this looks like and
hopefully my lips look nice so bish you
just couldn't blend out yo these
eyebrows are atrocious but my wing liner
is actually winged bitch look I said I
didn't think it was gonna be a perfect
wing I just said if I've even blend the
concealer my freakin sideburns aren't
got all these kids I mean is I only know
that's concealer
Oh watch it again what is I got like
three wings though what is this gold
 I mean I know it's bronzer but damn
I didn't feel like I use that much like
I still got Pete stuff right here goose

makeup without any any and not without a
mirror like this is it me I got some
lashes because there's so much of black
