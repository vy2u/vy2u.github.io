shall we okay so you guys know you know
my own Instagram you know Malibu dog
face and I've noticed like a little
pattern of things that are happening um
every time I say something you know it's
always somebody who got something and
saying I'm always the wrong as a
 in the world to say it so
recently I reposted a post that I had
posted probably like 13 weeks ago or
something and it's because a lot of
people are not aware that I don't make
wigs because they think you know a lot
of youtubers will sell their wigs and
they will make wigs for clients and so I
know April muffins is my lovers 2012 she
does it um
Latoya so effin vain she does it there's
a lot of different youtubers who provide
that service I just happen to not be one
of them because I have other things
going on in my life and I don't want to
be sitting there so in here all day
that's just not my thing to do and
everybody all my wig is ladies yours and
I'm like the reason why I do these
tutorials is so that you can have the
same thing that I have or you know you
save money in your pocket to do it
yourself I mean come on they're like I'm
trying I'm trying to help you save a
book you're getting mad at me because
you want to spend your money okay so I
put okay so let me just say this again I
said I guess I got to keep you posting
this because other people are not seeing
it then say it in a nasty way I just you
know I said what I said again this is my
personal Instagram I can say and do
whatever I want nobody can tell me that
I'm wrong for saying what I want to say
on my page so I said you know let me
just say this again I do not make or
sell wigs slash units I've said this
before maybe people are new they didn't
see it reposted it you can read it again
that's the great thing about videos like
these and Instagram posts you can always
scroll through and watch it again
instead of me having to say it again I I
can't give you a no hair or wigs for
free that I do not use anymore the
reason why I do not just give away stuff
is because I actually do give away stuff
there are our partner with three
different hair companies that I will not
mention only because it's not necessary
but they know who they are that I
partnered for the prom
season because there are some you know
some girls who have been working all
year and they just want to look good on
prom they don't have enough money to
afford here so we've got together to
give them some free hair so they can
look great on prom night great fine cool
but I don't feel the need to broadcast
it to you or anybody else because it's
not nobody else's business what I'm
giving somebody else for free there are
countless amount of wigs that I no
longer own because there are people who
are cancer survivors they may have lupus
so they give the hair falls out and I
give them free units so that they can
have something you know and I don't feel
the need to say oh shout out to Rebecca
beets wearing my old Italian yaki like
for what one she don't need to not have
anybody in her business like that - it's
none of your business what I do with my
personal wigs and three legs we'll have
to explain myself about my I don't
get it so anyway I will continue and I
put stop using my my business email for
personal use
people will hit me up with a long story
about their life in my you know business
email and they'll tag the subject as
hair or hair review and then they're
telling me something else and I'm like
listen I sorry that that's going on with
you right now but I am NOT your
therapist I cannot help everybody with
theirs under my own going on and
ain't nobody givin me no
sit down to talk to me about nothing so
understand outside of this I am still a
person and outside of this I do have a
life and I'm not I think people have an
issue with me and the things that I say
because I'm very blunt about what I do
and I say which I don't give a damn like
I just wanna keep it one which I don't
give a what anybody has to say
about me and I think that's why I've
made it by the way we had two hundred
thousand subscribers thank you everybody
who's here but I think the reason why
I've gotten as far as I've gotten
because I don't care and I don't not to
say I don't care about the people who
come and watch but I could care less
about anybody who wants to be a critic
about something that they had no hand in
that's my whole thing you didn't help me
later wig you didn't help me I'm saying
do anything you watch and you support it
and that's appreciated but at the end of
the day how can you a bitch whose hair
is never done tell me what I should do
with my that's the only thing I
oh I don't understand so this one girl
said well you're on celebrity status no
so you should understand that you should
be respectful and not get too big-headed
about your audience I said I'm getting
big-headed because I'm telling other
people to stop begging for my
okay girl so when I beg again I'm going
to try point them in yo direction how
about that and then see how much you
like it because people think when I or
anybody else say something it's because
somebody said at one time and we want to
pop off no no I read was one day one day
I got 21 emails 21 and one in 24 hours
asking for free something whether it was
hair whether it was a league whether it
was makeup that can I have the jacket
you like this is what people do so a lot
of times we do ignore it
we don't say anything but edits at a
point as a person
you get irritated because you're not
helping me respond to these emails I
don't respond to them nine times out of
ten so instead of me being a rude bitch
because you know that's what I'm called
often young you just a rude
disrespectful inconsiderate bitch I'll
be like okay that's like you um instead
of saying nothing at all I made a
general pose answering questions here
you can hear this bitch come you know
you are so disrespectful I'm
unsubscribing bye bitch like what I'm
not like that book like that like at the
end of the day you know how to try to
make me feel bad about having an opinion
about my and that's not what we're
going to do well you get the hair for
free so what difference would it make
you don't get some more hair so you
might as well just get out of way for
free first and foremost maybe I
like to have 40 different wigs that look
all the same maybe I mean you I mean a
lot of girls out here buy lipstick in
the same shade from four different
companies but they still keep every
shade that looks the same because they
all got different labels right so why is
it not okay for me to do it but it's
okay for you to do it and if I'm not
mistaken I really do want a pink Bentley
really really bad and I
know that Harris Hilton got hers free
from West Coast Customs but when she's
driving her Porsche I don't hit her up
and say
you know Paris you ain't even driving a
Bentley girl you might as well just give
it to me why don't I do that because one
is disrespectful to is very tacky and
three shows that I have no type of home
training so for you to get in anybody's
comments emails or anything and beg for
anything makes you look bad there are
women who have wrote to me respectfully
not asking for much and I've obliged to
help them out that's all it took but
when you sit up here and these are
people who cannot do for themselves that
they are working very hard but ends are
just not meeting and they need a little
bit of help I have no problem with that
but then you look up this a ratchet ass
bitch
sitting here she got a blunt every day
on Instagram she blowing smoke at the
camera like it's just a thing to do but
you want to complain about weed prices
you ain't complaining about weed prices
or you know you're not so this is the
it's one thing to be unfortunate and
less fortunate in certain certain
situations it's a whole nother to just
be lazy and cheap and I am not about to
sit up there and have my hard work be on
the backs of bitches who do not want to
do the very same I don't give a
what you do you're not getting no
bundles from me you're not getting a
free wig for me you're not getting a
smell for me a lot of you bitches don't
even get a reply for me
how about it because there are people
who have supported me brought every
 wig autumn review and then fell
on hard times and then they couldn't do
it anymore
they probably had to sell their units
they wanted this doing it really bad I'm
like I'm probably not gonna wear it
anymore not because it's bad or anything
but because I have one that's very just
kind of like it Oh fine whatever but
every time I say something it's a
problem and I'm tired you know for a
long time I just tried to kind of be
neutral and not say nothing and be like
you know I don't really want to take it
too seriously or take it but I'm tired
of that listen understand this this is
my personal Instagram this is my
personal YouTube page okay so I control
what goes on and goes off of these
 so understand I am NOT
Beyonce I am NOT no fun famous bitch by
a long shot
I will hit your ass back pop back slide
back clap back and hurt your
 feelings and then go about
my day
trust me I don't feel good people like
well you have to watch what you say
because there are kids
look up to you witness I'm not nobody's
role model bitch I don't understand why
should I be a role model for your
children that's when people will say oh
Rihanna's wrong because there are little
girls who look up really our goddamn
kids
she never different why should a pop
star be raising your children
why should a youtuber we raising your
children what are you doing as a parent
or not doing rather that you should be
doing to help your children out why why
does your child have to come to me to
get some type of inspirational work
because you're not giving it at home but
they want to get mad at me when I pop
back because either your child they
friend or some bitch you know that says
something crazy to me and I say
something back listen I have no problem
with clapping back to whomever wanted
I'm just saying at the end of the day I
don't come to your job and tell you what
you're doing wrong or right so I would
suggest that you do not do that to me
that's it that's all like I don't I
don't I'm not confrontational by a
longshot but y'all know that I just hold
no punches when it comes down to but you
want to say it let's go understand when
I or anybody else says something as far
as you know we are concerned we get more
backlash than you probably ever will
understand and it's not that we can't
handle it but you get fed up after a
while - you get irritable after a while
- there is that goes on in our life
outside of this that we may be mad or
upset or going through that you would
never have a clue about and sometimes
it's just not your business and you got
to come get on your Instagram or your
YouTube channel or your Facebook or your
Twitter and there's a bitch talking
and everybody does not get over trust me
if I was replying to everybody that was
talking bitch I would not have a
wink of sleep I wouldn't be our fresh
face like now you know I would just be
having a moment but sometimes it just
takes because sometimes you'll be like
whatever whatever whatever whatever
feena's just that one bitch that one
bitch that just look a hot stinking
boiling mess and you just be like you
know this is this but you got to get
everything on top of what you said so
you got to get the rap for the rest of
these plush oh bitch
you two made your bed and you back to
sleep in that it's just how
you feel
so I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if
I don't when it comes to
to how I feel at the end of the day
respect me and I respect you there are a
lot of you guys that I've known for a
number of years that I have you know
shoot at the with we didn't talk we
don't laugh who they had a good time and
then there's other people who feel like
they are entitled to say and do whatever
they want but as soon as your ass clap
the back oh you're rude you're
disrespectful you're unappreciative
you're bitch you're rude you're just you
know it's quick when you say something
that somebody don't like how quick they
turn into a fan into a hater is real
quick okay I don't use the word fan cuz
I think it's kind of like asinine is a
little self-centered to say I got fans
I have supporters I have people that
 with me but I wouldn't say I have
fans but people do say that cool fun
whatever but there are a lot of people
who've been cool like oh I love you in
one post and then the next post I make
that they don't really agree with they
want to oh you're just disrespectful and
you're rude and you're diss and I'll be
like bitch if I'm such these horrible
things what the are you here
there's a reason why I don't follow
Kanye West there is a reason why I don't
follow Kim Kardashian because they don't
do anything for me as far as stimulating
my brain so therefore I just don't
with them so if there's any inkling at
anytime in there like their name you
might possibly say something that I
don't like I just don't follow them it's
that simple
but then when you know the bitches who
want to make them over your presence
known they want to make their
 exit known which I don't
need you to tell me you going to the
door just turn your ass to the door get
the out auto shut the up
boom BAM boom done by like it's that
simple song again I'm not gonna change
for nobody on no YouTube channel or no
damn Instagram because at the end of the
day if you don't like Who I am then just
don't be here that's just that
example like which I'm not begging you
to be here you don't have to be here I'm
not older you against your will you push
that but you can approach it and even go
about your day
cool fine whatever I'm not I'm not it's
not that deep to me you know I'm saying
like people hold you and say you know he
needs this and if I leave it's gonna
hurt him no it's not is not really Doug
cuz there's gonna be somebody's gonna
come right after you and fill a little
space in it's gonna be what it is and
it's not to me to say I don't give a
 about you you'll be replaced but
it's the truth
like there's gonna
be somebody who's gonna feel what I'm
saying is you don't and then it's going
to be the end of it and it I'm just
going all day so you y'all have to
understand in social media and things
like that you can't control a person you
know when you sign that YouTube contract
it does not um it doesn't tell you oh
and by subscribing to this bitch this
bitch is not allowed to say this this
this have no feelings do this do that
have an opinion no none of that they
just here to serve you and your benefits
and your needs and then go about your
day that's not how it works we are real
people we are not robots okay we feel
the way we feel and you can take it or
you can leave it it to one of the two so
you pick and then we can move the
on okay so I just wanted to say that cuz
I did a video about this and it was a
rant and it was very rude and it was
very disrespectful and I was trying to
edit the down and it was just
getting worried somewhere somewhere so I
decided to kind of remix it and make it
a little more lighthearted this time
around but again I'm a person you
respect me I respect you you don't
respect me you and tell me what it
is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
