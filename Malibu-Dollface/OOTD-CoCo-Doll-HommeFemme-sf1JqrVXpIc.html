this is I'm gonna show you how to wear a
statement piece together with something
else a little more flashy okay this is a
sweater that I wore as you can see it
has the big Chanel number 5 on the front
of it the sides it has a 5 over here in
a Chanel Chanel on this side be careful
with the fake ones because the they're
switched and those big thick lines are
very short and small for people who are
like selling the authentic ones they're
supposed to match the bottom so yeah
they have Chanel on each side of the
sleeves and it says home a film los
angeles with hashtag of course
how many film it's in a medium I'm very
petite but it actually fit perfect it
just has a zippers on the side if you
want like ventilation but if not you can
just wear them zipped up like that the
back just has to cook hole number 5 on
the back and it's as homely film at the
bottom this is just something like you
want a statement piece out of your
entire outfit where everything else is
simple but this is the standout moment
um
this hockey sweater has been seen on
blac chyna Keyshia Cole - Harry from
Love &amp;amp; Hip Hop New York and a rapper 2
Chainz now these are the shoes of course
he said my Jeremy Scott tinsel bears
this was another statement to go along
with the top it could get a little out
of hand for most people but for me this
was perfect I went with silver because
that's the color of like Chanel per se
but I wanted to mix gold and silver
together since it's like the new trend
that's going on right now so it came out
of dope and they're sparkly my glasses
were ten dollars from pop killer my
necklace was 17 dollars from downtown LA
the actual Jersey itself was a hundred
in $67 from home a film la comm me
acting a stupid mess in forever 21 my
pants were 1999 from H&amp;amp;M my shoes were
200 from adidas my jewelry was from
ShoeDazzle it came all together with the
watch and all the accessories and stuff
and my pouch is a Louboutin it was from
the louboutin store and my hair was from
April's lace wigs looking real big and
fluffy and me acting a stupid yet again
thank you for watching and I will talk
to you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
