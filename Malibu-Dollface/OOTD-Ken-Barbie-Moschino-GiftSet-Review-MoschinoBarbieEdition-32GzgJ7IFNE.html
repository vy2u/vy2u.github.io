your MP I do I don't care with you heads
so you're not getting paid either I
don't care what you haters saying up
your ante up say your name get em pay
I'm sayin
I know I don't have any haters on your
number I do I don't care what you hate
me say you don't hate and cake if you
ain't talking like me I don't understand
your name okay guys so I want to do
something a little fun a little bit
different than I'm used to because you
guys know my last video that idea was of
course the braids so I wanted to you
know you'd never realize how much you
missed something into you and did it in
a while so I had to go back and get pink
and pretty again so it's gonna be like a
matchup of two separate videos it's
gonna be um a more of a outfit of the
day because today the mosquito Barbies
which I will put them in its the
mosquito Canon Barbie came out today and
of course you guys know though I had to
get mines and then also because it was
the release day whenever a mosquito does
anything Barbie related I like to have a
moment okay so I wore this nice um you
can't will you'll see as soon it's like
a bathrobe but uh but it's also is
actually a dress from the Barbie
collection that came out last year so
I'm gonna go through a lot of people
were wondering like what specs and all
that stuff so we're gonna do that now
okay so we're gonna start with my hair
which is from Jenny lace wigs and you
guys know I reviewed this hair last year
yeah last year around my birthday or was
it this year it might be this year
around but I don't work I don't recall
but I did have this hair it was straight
when I did it I had left a lot of lace
on it cuz I was still trying to figure
out the ins and outs of how you know the
front fools were gonna lay and I was
they're gonna work but obviously her we
got it so it definitely looks very
different now than it did and I just
thought this was gonna be great
of course my first thought would have
been just to go ahead and do blonde
because it's Barbie but because I just
wanted a lot of contrasting color I
decided to go ahead and
you pink which this is definitely mm-hmm
my favorite pink on me period I just
think it's beautiful it's amazing it's
the same hair um this is a new frontal
however I've the last frontal that I had
I had when I started to do the whole
guys to be glue thing I tried it and it
didn't really work out as well um so
they asked them could they send me
another frontal and they did so this is
a new one but the hair is not new the
hair is definitely the same y'all always
asked me about my lips I use chestnut by
Mac on my for my lip liner and then I
use up for the actual pink in the inside
I use this color from YSL called nude
beige and it's from there it's the I
don't have it but it's in a gold gold
white so two contacts are my Heidrich or
topaz iou's because these are like a
blue color in Barbie's eyes are blue so
I wanted but I also bronze the stank out
of myself because I wanted to be a
contrast between my skin color and my
actual hair which I love
real quick pictures here just because I
can't get everything in a shot um this
is the bathrobe um dress from 2015 was
you know summer I think it was summer
spring collection and yeah this is very
comfortable it's very cute it comes with
a hood on the back and this is actually
based on a real Barbie outfit which a
lot of those were like my jeans are you
know and I got pretty much everything
from this collection so whenever I have
a chance to pull this out of my closet
you know I do okay the next thing is my
bag that I wore with this today which is
a PVC inflatable bag with the gold the
mosquito hardware as well as the UM the
handle whoa the strap and then it comes
with these little loud suckers here
which these are actually removable but I
just kept them on because it was just so
colorful today so you know I just wanted
to feel just like a Barbie doll you guys
may have seen amber rose with this purse
um and I think she has a longer when I
have one that doesn't have a zipper on
uh but this one actually has differences
I don't trust people plus I don't you
guys know we're persons but when I do
for these purposes then I just was could
it be any more Barbie yeah um so yeah
okay for my shoes because I know I
couldn't as much as because this look
was going to be very different I was
gonna actually like wear my hair like in
a bigger curl and I was gonna put on
like my denim Barbie kind of like my
birthday photos like that with some
timberlands but that changed and I was
like no I'm just gonna do something a
little more elegant just because Ken and
Barbie have um you know a suit in some
gallon so you know why not so for shoes
I opted for these which are my so Kate's
I don't remember what color this is um
it's like a peach color yeah they're
like peach this just seeing this at the
bottom makes my heart drop I is that but
listen I'm going to a kelabra and all of
this just a lot so okay I don't wear
heels often and when I do this is how
much wear I've had these I got them this
year you see how much where I got of
them not really much and this is like
three wears thanks Christian
and I just had these pearls that I
actually got when I was filming scream
queens so I has those and then he's loud
at bangles um I think I got from forever
21
okay so this is what the Barbies come in
so my other musky no Barbies which I'll
show you guys ok so last year Makino
released Barbies as well and it was
these Barbies and I actually have both I
have the African American and Caucasian
a version but she was the closest so it
came with the very crunchy hair all of
this I have everything in this box I own
in real life that's what I love about my
skeino is that they make especially for
Barbie they make everything that you can
buy in real life um for the dolls as
well and of course mr. Jeremy's sculpt
so there was like rumors going around
that there was gonna be a new Barbie
release this year but all the dig and I
I tried to do I couldn't find anything
for the longest and then out of nowhere
boombastic there we go
so I got the dolls today they came in
this box now you can see this box and
that box are very different so it came
with this like sleeve over it and Bobby
and can look like that oh my my words
Lord so Barbie is wearing the graffiti
dress as you can see with a lien on it
and Ken is wearing Jeremy Scotts outfit
that he wore at the VMAs and this year
Jeremy actually um created a moon man
based on I think it was him
and then in the back of this it has all
of the mosquito information and this is
a no more than four thousand three
hundred were made worldwide of these so
these are limited these were we consider
let's see this is a gold label doll so
yeah these were actually there were more
of these made than aware of those other
ones the other ones only 700 were made
worldwide this one has four thousand so
quite a few of these were made that one
those are long for crazy amounts on eBay
I'm not selling mine's anybody who's
interested but these dolls this set went
for with 200 and the single Barbies that
came out last year went for 150 so you
got a extra doll um I actually have
another one of these coming so that
could actually open but I'm gonna keep
this whole box display situation cuz
this is extremely cute and my people
that mosquito they always do me right
they always call me when I'm they know
it's gonna be something Barbie related
now how I feel about the dolls is I feel
like Barbie's outfit and stuff are very
basic I love that it's a mosquito Barbie
but I expected more quite frankly I like
Ken's whole getup did I think it was
more about kink is even the commercial
and how they titled it on their
Instagram is Ian and Barbie musky no not
Barbie and Ken you know first and second
billing means something in adult world
okay but I will say I really do like
Ken's outfit I like his hair I wish that
they would have made coz of Jeremy got
his
on doll and musky I mean Barbie says him
his own doll and I think it's only like
one in existence but I wish they would
have just kept Ken as Jeremy now I think
that would have been great but overall I
think the the tailoring on this
this suit is crazy like for this to be a
super detailed compared to his in real
life which I'll put here and like okay
like they did the damn thing and I love
you guys know I'm a Barbie fanatic not
even just because of the name but I
legit and Barbie obsessed and I've been
since I was a little boy so this is
means a lot this this is makes me very
happy so the fact that I was able to go
and get one and have one on the way and
it's it's great I feel like and then
I've been able to actually meet um
Robert best who does Barbies
illustrations and I was also able to
meet Kim who's actually the head
designer of Barbie and I'll put pop
photos I've met them twice and the
second time I met them was at the made
la ski no fashion show and she came up
to me and was like you know Robert told
me that you know Malibu Barbie was here
and it's just fun like when you are
kidding you play with toys and stuff
like that you they mean something to you
and as an adult
it still has a bit of an impact on not
even a bit look at me as a lot of impact
on me and how you know just how my life
is RAM based on the glimmering isthmus
of dolls now because I didn't too much
care for Barbies look um they and I felt
like this was just more about Ken anyway
but like I said I just feel like this is
Kim's moment on they actually have beach
towels that actually were the photos the
stuff like the photo shoot photos the
press photos um made that they sold as
well so I got Kim um which is really
nice because ain't until nice and Lana
oh man you get I'm saying so it made
more sense for me to be in a bikini land
on this than it would for me to be
don't worry you know it's mostly gonna
be to look like but um I thought this
was really cute I think these were 135
apiece um for the actual and they're
really big I'm not gonna take this one
I'll just because I don't feel like
refold in it but if you go to the
website or google it you'll see I it's
it's a big ass town um which I thought
was really cool you know cuz he's he's
kind of like it's like a life-size tell
he's gonna on me obviously my he's
hitting his biggest mines but cheese
okay so yeah and you know I had to break
out you know my mosquito Barbie mirror
from a phone it's just it's a moment so
I'm pleased to say that I'm very happy
with my purchases and whenever mosquito
ever releases anything but really you
wouldn't know I'm there plus I really do
like their clothes like and I think it's
because I'm very out there hence my
outfit with the fashion I just like to
be fearless with fashion because it's
fun like what point in life is pink hair
ever okay you get what I'm saying so for
me this was great and so I want to thank
everybody at mosquito la Xiaomi Rana
Raley Rose Nicole everybody I'm a thing
Jeremy because every time I meet Jeremy
which I'll put some photos here he's
always very nice to me he's always very
sweet he remembers who I am
um which is great because you know I've
been a big Jeremy Scott fan before even
got one you know and just to see the
love that he shows is amazing so that's
fun and then I want to thank you guys as
well for supporting my Barbie habit and
uh you know the name Malibu which is
really funny came from you guys it was
just like Malibu doll face and I just
wanted to change my name but then now my
name is become Malibu because of you
guys from calling me that
so thank you I appreciate it I feel like
I don't say thank you enough I try to
but it doesn't seem like I do but don't
think I take anything that you guys do
for me for granted because I really
don't enough cuz they all I'm real them
look good so I catch you guys in my next
one pers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
