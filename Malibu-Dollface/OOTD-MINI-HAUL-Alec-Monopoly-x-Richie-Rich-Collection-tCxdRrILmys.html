the top is like a mesh top / hoodie it
has richie rich on the back and then it
has it on my side and his face is on the
actual hood part and then this is what
the back looks like it's like a graffiti
style but i loved it because i was able
to show my stomach without looking big
and boxy my watch is a I style g-shock
and my lipstick is actually Kat Von D's
Oh which i think is witches um liquid
lipstick my chain is from my local swap
meet for those who keep asking about the
jewelry that i have for that particular
chain and this is what it looks like in
its entirety so as you can see that you
can see my stomach and it's well
ventilated and i'm killing it um but
also you can kind of see that it gives a
baggy look and then the pants that i
have on say rich across the entire band
which actually you can fold those up if
you want to but they haven't been inside
and then it's what it looks like from
the side and then the pants a are rich
on the side as well and i think it says
Alec on the bottom oh yeah on a bottom
portion my shoes are giuseppe zanotti
these are the velvet blue ones circle
has are all black ones but i can't find
them in my size so from a distance they
definitely look black i also purchased
this cute sweater with richard to space
on the front and then it's cute
hundred-dollar bill on the back with his
face on it in Alex neck also got this
cute little I don't I mean I'll use it
for like traveling makeup but I just
thought it was really cute and it was
really inexpensive too so I said widen
and you guys know live for a good one
piece so this is actually the bathing
suit type that they sold with it as well
so yeah I mean I thought it was really
cute and I said why not cuz I could be
photographed it is like some cute photos

Barbie forever 21 collection so yeah I
