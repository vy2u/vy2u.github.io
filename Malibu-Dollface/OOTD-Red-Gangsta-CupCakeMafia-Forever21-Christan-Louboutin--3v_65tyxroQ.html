were asking about these are from cupcake
mafia they have zippers on the side to
get in and out of them so it won't be
baggy around the ankle when you wear
them as you can see this is actually
made out of Ventana material so it
actually is pretty thin
they were on sale these are a bit
overpriced but I got them on so they do
have elastic in the inside these are a
small / medium this is the jacket that
you guys were asking about this is from
forever 21 it is a size small if it's
perfect on me
it has zipper the zipper in the front
actually works two zippers on the side
urges or aesthetic purposes only
they have no pockets in them as well as
the ones on the wrist area they sit up
and down but it just kind of makes the
wrist part a little bit tighter if you
wanted and then I just wore these glue
these worry abou Louboutins with these
because I just needed something that is
my pop of color and as you know the
bottoms are red and I just paired it
with a wife beater and topic I turned
out great I loved it it's very simple
but very cute they were on sale but $32
and they was normally $90 then my jacket
was perfectly well mr. jacket cost and
then I got the rebel tussle my outfit
does match you know it has the red if
you like this right he got on the bushes
it matches so yeah it's a cute little
after that you just want to do something
real quick you steal you know thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
