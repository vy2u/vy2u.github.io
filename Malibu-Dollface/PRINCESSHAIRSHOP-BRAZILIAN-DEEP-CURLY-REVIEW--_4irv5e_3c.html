just see the texture of this hair just
so you can get up close and personal
about what's really going on in my head
right now okay guys so I am back with
something different but cute okay so you
guys know I love big hair and you guys
know I love full hair and this is both
this is the Brazilian deep curly from
princess hair shop um
this hair I've been rocking for a week
and I have oh yeah like a week and a
half and then like a little bit of
change cuz I did I did not wear this to
my friend's thing cuz it was gonna be
hot but um this is the hair I have yet
to wash it or Co wash it yet
I just been kind of living with it and
so far so good and I will give you guys
the pros and cons that I love about this
particular hair but just look at this
okay like my silk lace closure it's from
closure store it matches this hair so
perfectly which I absolutely love um so
okay you guys know years back if you
guys follow me during my myspace days my
hair look like this
99.9% of the time and then I stopped
wearing my hair like that because I went
in to start wearing braids and now I'm
really missing those days of this big
careless curly hair I am excited so when
I I did a tutorial on how I made this
wig um for those who are not aware or
who don't know I do not provide any type
of wick services but I will give you a
list of people in my tutorial that who
do provide these services for you but I
just don't have the time in my day to be
making wigs for the world however there
are other people who do and I will give
you their information but I did do
tutorial because I promised you guys
that I would do a tutorial on how to
make a wig and why not do this beautiful
hair when I first received the hair it
had this nice uniform deep curl to it
which I knew was gonna be great I have
in four bundles so I have in - 28 and
226 s and then I think my still base
closure is 16 or 20 I think I think it's
20 because it's long like it's longer
than what I'm used to with my closures
um none of my straight closures are as
long as it seemed like this one is but
that's now but yeah I have in four
bundles you honestly don't need four
bundles if you don't want your hair this
fool but you guys know me I like it
dramatic I like it big and I like I have
a big faith in a small head so I like
hair that kind of evens out my face so
my face looks now proportionate to my
body um so I will say that one of the
hang-ups that I kind of did have with
this hair is that you see like it's so
like it's so thick but it is so um it's
the de waving it is so deep sometimes
you I do get like a couple of snags
where they want to ball up at the end
but I will tell you that I know
Jayda the owner of princes hair shop has
his hair keke miss diva like has his
hair and there's one more person who has
his hair as well and once I actually
like shampoo it the entire curl and the
entire like all the hair is gonna relax
much more than what it is so it's gonna
hat it's gonna not look so much like
this and it's gonna start to look more
like this down here like very just free
and flowy so it's just because it here
is really fresh and it's new him because
I can take this off I don't sleep with
it on it's pretty much still in the same
condition that it was when I first put
it in you could use crow cream and stuff
like that but for right now I just want
it to be big and dramatic but that's the
only hang-up that I've had with this
hair is just that because it still it's
just fresh you know it's fresh hair but
I can't think of any curly hair
that I haven't had that minor issue is
and again once you wash it or Co wash it
that pretty much goes away because it's
gonna relax the curl the crowd was very
very very tight when I received it um so
it's been like I said it's been about
almost two weeks now since I've had this
hair in and I've been rocking it and I
loved it this lady at the grocery store
was like is this your real hair and if
it is it is gorgeous if it's not it's
still gorgeous I said it's not but thank
you girl
thank you so much I appreciate you so
this will be hair like if you just want
to be dramatic about it this would also
be very cute with a crop top because you
just got this big man going on so yeah I
love this I I definitely love this um
and it I think I love it even more
because I did my you part my my wig
differently than I used to do them so if
the the fitting of this wig is actually
just very perfect as well it fits my
face I like somebody asked me well it's
been a few people who have asked me to
do every time there's like every time
you get curly hair you always do a side
part the reason why is because I do have
a medium sized face but this much hair
what the middle part would look like
this like it's not I can't I could do
this and then do this and I could be
okay but if it's in the middle it's just
a lot of hair going on in my face and
it's not flattering on on me at least
I've seen a lot of other people do it
and it looks great on them it's just not
a good look for me
um but besides that it holds the curl
pattern itself though is just so
beautiful like it bounces it Springs
like this is it's a very low maintenance
that's the thing that I love about curly
hair is it's low maintenance you if you
wear wigs like I do because I don't wear
weaves at all no more but if you ever
was like I do this is something when you
could just shake it off and go out um
with maybe want to do this particular
style that Nicole from the Pussycat
Dolls back in LA when I was a big PCD
fan um they had a video for a song that
I love which was hush hush and they did
this I Will Survive remix and I was not
happy about that however her hair in the
video was so
and so gorgeous and so natural very
Donna Summer very Diana Ross and it
definitely took me back to where I you
know what I used to love about big hair
so a comma Thank You Nicole because it
definitely helped me go back to my roots
of what I really really liked and if
you're not one for a lot of straight
hair and you do like your natural hair
or you are natural and you want some
hair that not the same texture as yours
but close enough you could definitely
blend this with natural hair you have to
leave out a little bit of leave out and
it'll be great I only have about this
much leave out in the front and that's
really just it's just the baby here
that's right here and then that's it and
then my wig starts here and that's it
yeah so it's not it's not hard this is
much easier than straight hair straight
hair is a bit of a task for people who
are not well-versed in that particular
area so I would definitely go this route
if you're just starting out to kind of
get yourself familiar with how to do
wigs how to wear wigs and stuff like
that because you can hide a lot of your
mistakes because his hair is so large it
doesn't have to be SuperDuper flat if
you're just learning how to sew or
whatever so this will be perfect
um again printer shop never fails me
when it comes to my hair my blue hair is
still kicked in um so yeah I'll be back
for an update all my updates are gonna
be like back to back now because they a
lot of them have been over three weeks
or whatever and I just haven't got
around to doing them but there will be
some updates coming on for a lot of the
other hair that I have and I will come
back for this hair but I want to be
wearing this sucker out because it's so
dramatic
and that's why I love it and this hair
texture is so great and soft and I love
the way that new hair smells new virgin
hair smells so good I don't know what it
is but it just smells like so good so
yeah I'll continue to smell my hair but
I'll let y'all know what's good and
y'all will see this in a some upcoming
videos cuz I did a few videos last week
in this so yeah talk to y'all later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
