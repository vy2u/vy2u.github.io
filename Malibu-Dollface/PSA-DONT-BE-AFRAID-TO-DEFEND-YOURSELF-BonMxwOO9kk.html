about defending yourself and I don't
mean like physically I mean I drew me
physically don't don't get me wrong but
I mean this is more so about like
verbally defending yourself because
after my little rant there was kind of
like an argument about me shit I should
not have the right to defend myself
I mean bitch really I got every right
but you know people have their their
opinions and just as a side note people
think when I do videos like brand videos
like that I'd really be like upset and
it's not that I'm upset about it
it'll very passionate about what I'm
saying you know it's not like I'm I'm a
nobody if it'll give me like yeah I
never seen me upset like if you think
that's upset you don't want to see me
upset like it's just not that deep but
um
yeah this is about basically defending
yourself cuz I noticed that a lot of
people do not do it you know like they
supposed to and a lot of people's like I
wish I had the courage to comment people
the way that you did to defend your
character that somebody was trying to
basically tear down or whatever and let
me just make a you know outside no you
can't fight and argue and cuss out
everybody in the world although I did
cut out of dude the other day y'all okay
we probably can get into this let me
just tell you what happened the other
day
so my friend told me they need to borrow
some money and I was like oh cool I
gotta go to bank though so I went to the
bank to get money then um my car started
a little on the funny side like it was
struggling his throne who but I was on
the phone so I but he didn't pay much
attention I got to the bank yard got out
the bank went to go start my car and
guess what happened nothing so I'm like
are you in serious and I brought a
battery earlier a new battery for my car
earlier this year so uh from pet boys so
it was right across the street
y'all know I was so hurt about it you
better believe I took that damn cuz I
don't have to play no more so cuz I'm
just too high and my car don't never
give me problems like that if you have
no damn trouble a so I was like I'm a
goal and just take the battery out and
take in Japan boys and see if it's just
like I needed to be charged or something
maybe you know so I
my lights on or something yard oh I took
my ass right I took it out in the car
walk clean across the street and took it
over there looking hoodies I was
carrying a battery like purse so uh but
yeah I could somebody out because I was
the point of me saying is cuz I was
about to back out after I was there for
all them hours waiting for that damn
battery to charge I go back out his foot
almost fucking hit my car all I cussed
his ass for every four-letter word I
could make up and I knew okay so um a
lot of people don't I guess you could
say don't take up for this hell because
they don't want to come off as a bitch
they don't want to come off as oh well
um I don't like to do that to people
which is fine you know we all have our
ways in which we handle ourself and
sometimes it may not be agreed upon by a
certain party or certain people or
whatever but for me myself and I I like
to defend myself because of the simple
fact that um I don't want I don't like
to have to I don't live my life always
on edge ready to fight somebody ready to
disrespect somebody ready to go off on
somebody that's not how I operate so
when it does come away I just want to
kind of put a sensor out there like that
oh you ain't try this with someone else
but you're not gonna try with me we're
not going to go there because I'm not
that person like I'm not my life does
not consist of the bullshit so once you
kind of put the bug in somebody's ear
and let somebody see what type of person
you are because people are only going to
try you when you let them try you when
they know that you're not to be fucked
with they will not do it that's just
bottom line that's just common sense you
know if you see a bull and you see a
rule book your ass if you get too close
you ain't gonna fuck with the bull like
I'm unless you stupid
but for the most part you not gonna fuck
with that bull so most people for that
once they see your character in action
and the things that you actually doing
and how you operate when somebody
disrespects you they come at you crazy
they talk to you crazy they do all these
things to you then they know that you're
not that one so I think it's very
important that in life you have to
stand up for something because you will
fall for anything so make sure that when
somebody does come at you and they
disrespect you or they're rude to you
you do let them know and it always it
does not always have to be in a nasty
disrespectful manner but it should be in
a way where you let them know bitch i'ma
tell you something right now you're
gonna watch your mouth
you don't watching which the way you
speak to me because I am I will knock
door so you know I'm saying like I don't
never go around like I always say please
and thank you when I go to restaurants
fast food play anywhere like it doesn't
matter where I could be in bathroom if
you hold the door for me I'm gonna say
thank you and I'm gonna say please or
whatever because I think just to be
respectful this is a common courtesy
that a lot of people do not have that
look at you funny
they snarl at you now somebody just
being rude for you for no reason for you
to you for no reason
then I understand that you don't want to
kind of give them the time of day but
when somebody is overtly trying to just
disrespect who you are genuinely as a
person sometimes you have to dig in that
ass to get your point across because I
know for me tell y'all there have been
times where I've burst it off and I
haven't said anything because it wasn't
worth me saying you know like sometimes
some people are so beneath you that is
not even worth you even opening your
mouth and other people just kind of
catch you on a bad day or in a bad
moment and they just get the just the
fiery fucking end of it like people
who's now videos are private about their
mothers so um stuff like that you know
sometimes you do have to kind of digging
somebody's ass to kind of get that point
across but you guys have to stop being
so 10-minute you guys have to stop being
like so scared to speak up because in
life life will drag your hands by your
drawers and throw you over the balcony
if you let it so and you can't let
people do that either you can't be let
people run over you and be disrespectful
to you because if you do that you're
going to you know you're never going to
be able to hold your own as and I can
hold my own against anybody I don't give
a fuck with now fighting is a different
story because if you bigger than me the
shit my
are going down but if we toe to toe and
it is what it is then let's do it like
I'm not I'm too grown to be fighting but
if it comes if you hit me first it's on
I'm so I'm sorry but I come from the
jungles of LA okay this is what I was
taught this is how I was taught so um I
mean for me my advice to a lot of people
would be learn how to let people know
what type of person you are and learn
and put yourself in the situation and
put your yourself out there where you
hold yourself with a certain amount of
respect you hold yourself with a certain
amount of grace you hold yourself with a
certain amount of know-how that people
want even fuck with you they won't even
think about fucking with you in that
realm to know that he or she do not play
that shit you know don't be going around
being scared of nobody because people
see that and you know people take your
kindness for weakness a lot of times
they take your weakness for I'm a fuck
you up and I'm gonna do and say whatever
you want just like a lot of times that I
see people in abusive relationships and
I know that I know a lot of people who
have been in abusive relationships and
it's not always easy to get out of so
I'm not insensitive to that but i'ma
tell you something right now
you ain't gotta do not you you fart on
me
i'ma whoop your ass so if you decide you
want to try and punch me you want to hit
me you want to push me you better say
excuse me if I am in your way and by the
dresser and you need to get on the other
side you better not put your hands on me
so I think when you have that type of
attitude and that mentality ain't nobody
gonna try you you know I'm saying but
when you continue to let them do that
especially if you're in a situation
where somebody has hit you once they've
hit you twice they hit you a few times
they think now it's okay because he or
she's not going to do anything if I do
it you know and when you start hitting
that or you start saying that I'm not
dealing with this no more you want to
leave and you want to up and go and live
your life and don't want to fuck with
crazy bitch crazy dude no more then they
get it but then it's too late you know
so you have to protect yourself you know
and sometimes it may have to be
physically sometimes it may have to be
mentally sometimes it have to be
verbally it depends on the circumstance
but make sure that you are always
own hero don't look for the next person
to save you from trouble or save you
from an issue or a problem or a
confrontation because it's it's not
always someone that's going to be there
for you you have to be there for
yourself you know and when you start to
have children you want to instill these
same facts and things these nature to
your children because you don't want
them to go to school and be bullied you
don't want them to go to school and not
have a backbone and not be able to hold
their own but when people would come at
me crazy in school I would pop back real
quick you know and people would be like
don't leave him alone because he's not
that you know I'm saying like just don't
say nothing to him because he will go
the fuck in
I didn't let people get the best of me
like that like I am Who I am and if you
don't like it and you don't care get the
fuck on why do you care so much about
what the fuck I'm doing it period you
know it's stuff like that and when you
kind of let the world know bitch it
ain't happening
then they get it you know so you have to
make sure to defend your character
defending your honor for yourself if you
have children if you have a wife you
have a husband you do that you know and
it's not you don't always have to do it
just to understand that every time
somebody say something slick or somebody
say a stupid-ass comment every battle is
not meant to be fought
you know sometimes you have to let shit
ride because certain people are not
worth swinging worth getting your ass
whooped worth getting you know your face
scratch over something I was so stupid
to begin with you know sometimes those
people get they're bitter they're mad
they're upset life has got them down and
they want you to feel the exact same
thing that they do you know and this
goes not just with strangers but this
goes with family too people think that
because you're you have family they're
off-limits from getting told off getting
a ass whooped getting cuts the fuck out
no I cussed plenty of family members out
and they don't fuck with me no more you
know they understand just don't don't do
it like I got cousins out on fucking
cousin bitch's messy is fuck you know
and it's unfortunately we grew up
together and
we were cool but when you are at a point
where you feel like somebody has
something other than gender against you
in your own family for no fucking reason
you do shit the other type of
motherfuckers you don't want to mess
with and that's when you got to let
somebody know I don't fuck with you you
know I'm saying because if I do oh
you're gonna get it you know I'm saying
every time I see you bitch you're gonna
get it and every time I hear your name
you're going to get it so it's one of
those type of situations so remove the
cancer from your life because you don't
want cancerous people around you and
also when those people come at you
disrespectful and things of that nature
and you've gotten fat the fuck up and
you feel like well if I say something
it's going to be a problem let it be a
problem let it be a problem because of
the simple fact that people will try you
when they feel like you won't do
anything do something soon as you pop
and do something you better believe
they're gonna be like I'm not fucking
with you like that no more I'm not gonna
say nothing to you no more I'm not gonna
they gonna leave you the fuck alone
so always defend yourself that's what
your mouth is for this with your fists
fool too but always make sure that you
get your point across you let somebody
know what type of individual are and do
not be scared to stand your ground
because you have every right to defend
your person to the next person don't let
nobody believe that because oh because
your this year I don't give a fuck what
you are you could be white yellow blue
green gay straight bisexual trans I
don't fucking matter and for bitch
disrepect disrespect you then disrespect
the ass back okay especially when they
go just above and beyond with it you
know you especially the ones that are
quiet that don't really say nothing
usually when they go in oh it is like a
charlatan get that bitch little bitch no
you ain't you boys you know just let
them know you ain't dead mother like go
in because that is the best way to show
somebody is by example and show them
your example is bitch I like five to
that ass I'm good
jail so I just kind of wanted to come
with that PSA real quick to kind of let
all my peoples know that I do think
about you guys
a lot of times when I get messages and
stuff like that about people having
trouble with just things in life you
know this is what creates the topics
that I do because you know I may be very
comfortable in my skin I may be very
comfortable with the person that I am
some people and a lot of people are not
and a lot of people do get ridiculed
bullied and disrespected for who they
are whether it be their sexuality their
race the way that they look whatever
whatever you know a lot of times
unfortunately Society does that in anime
it will be a good person down so I'm
just trying to give you a little
brotherly advice fuck the world and go
in a guns a-blazin if somebody gets
stupid with you you know and you'll be
alright but um yeah I hope you guys stay
