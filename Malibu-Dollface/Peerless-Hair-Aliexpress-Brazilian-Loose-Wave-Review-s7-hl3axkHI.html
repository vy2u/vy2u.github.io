framed so oh this hair is from peerless
hair this is their loose ways and I have
had two terraces in June so we've had we
become very accustomed to get hurt her
sister so I'm asking where the frontal
is well so my frontal is also a matching
frontal that goes with this hair texture
as welcome and get a little closer so
you can see because I'm only using one
source of light right now so this is
what the texture looks like now this is
not the original texture of this hair it
was more it was it was heavier what look
it was softer when I first got it no
because I've had this hair since June
what if happened offenses I've watched
it I'll put it in the bond I wore down I
have my straighten and I wanted to kind
of see how it would be after so long now
they sent me a 18 inch frontal and my
bundles I believe are all 24 because
it's all one length and I did not um
well I trimmed it a little bit but it's
not nothing major that's different if
this hair is pretty long okay now I will
say this that the hair color is a
natural color it's all over red in
person and I don't know what that's from
but have like like a nice little all
burnished you can't tell on camera I
wish you guys could go to my house
but I like this this is this reddish
tinsel which doesn't bother me at all
and I'm sure if it was straight you can
see it however I'm not one for straining
in my my curly hair anymore just because
one is a lot of work and two you can
kind of ruin the pattern of the hair and
you see how fluffy and bigness is I
don't I wouldn't really want to mess
this up they said to say my idea of a
good time
you know the frontal is a very standard
13 by 4 front so it's nothing special
and then the hair itself came out very
uniform and you run your fingers through
it and it gets bigger what I did with
this is I every time I washed his hair I
like to go ahead and wash it first then
I'll wash it then I'll sit in there nice
deep condition I haven't did anything to
this hair that is any different from my
other haha remember I got here in June
it was really hot and I wanted just a
really slick puffball spring to the top
all this hair so all the way to the top
and what I did notice that it didn't
happen because it was too much air in
the back though in the nape area it
started to get like very very very
tangled very natty which is terrible but
that wasn't the hair spot is my cause
anybody if you ever have any stress I
mean any curly hair or any way to here
you know and you soon as heat and
rubbing starts to get involved then
problems start to ensue in any what you
want which is though so my advice to you
is if you do get this hair be careful
with the amount of product that you put
in it because I find that the more
product equipment here such as like a
lot of coconut oil a lot of argan oil if
you start to do that then what the hair
will start to do is it will start to
expand here has a tendency to the more
products I'll put it like welcoming a
conditioner in it and it just started to
kind of get tangled in the back because
of the condition or both I'll rinse it
out and wore like this it'd be fine and
I wore my hair like this in bequite okay
I don't know if y'all know
the right lately is ruining um and I
want to be a little
you know down the street one day so I
decided to rock this out to the corner
store to get my Ollie pop that I
incurred it was real good um but overall
the hair from 1 to 10 I'll give it an 8
I just don't you know it's crow here
it's just waiting here well it's
Lewthwaite hair um and this is not the
original texture that it was when I
first first got it it was a little bit
more like I said softer and then I was
able to take this and I just took my
wand and I rewind it whatever was a
little bit on the straight side which is
only parts like this right here and if I
try to do this this part like this then
it's going to be way to use I mean it's
going to be straighter so when this part
that was at the top because I imported
the half-up half-down so therefore it's
about this much of the hair was actually
slicked when it was higher so what I had
to do was take the ends of this and then
wand in them combing through and then
make sure it looks just like this so
that's all it's going to take a little
more manipulating than it was for the
rest of the hair because you're doing
different things with it but I do like
this frontal I just don't like the fact
that the front wouldn't come in with any
dividends around the hairline I wasn't
too happy with that but overall this is
this is I like this I like to survive
you know so again this is you got to be
careful with the texture if you're not
one for taking care of hair that is
really big or has a lot of body to it
then you kind of got to be careful
because again wanting his hair was a
little time-consuming I will say but it
was it was over worth it for the look
that I wanted and I do think that
peerless here because I believe I work
with them before they have a lot of
right here and a lot of reviews that I
have watched from other people have said
the same thing like I really do like
their hair it's just that you got to be
careful with what you get um I said I
haven't got any it's just stuff does the
except for the your regular that you can
get with curly in and loose weight hair
that but nothing that it's like globs of
just
hair and as you can see even the ends of
this still look good
they don't look terrible they don't look
bad they don't look you know uneven and
scraggly in that some of it is strain
and then the other is wavy like we're
not doing under that so if you are
interested in this loose wave
shish-kabob just remember I did one this
hair so your hair texture might be a
little bit more on the droopier side if
you try to do this down other thing I
did was take a standard like one and a
half inch arm I think is a half inch of
ribbing tanaan and I just wanted it
through it and I did it any one has to
be perfect
I just take it pull it let it go and
then pull it out and she's going to make
this very wild but she looks a set of
the very uniformed look that you would
get when you first get it that's all
now when you first get your any finger
through it sick so again
oh one to ten I'll give them an eight
shots of hairless hair for letting me
keep this hair this long and really give
it all our head and I just like this
list I like to look all like you know
all those it's a good stuff and now blow
up off the bump so I will catch you guys
on my next one I hope you guys enjoyed
this and are you planning to wear
pigtails this summer good on you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
