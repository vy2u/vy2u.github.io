mr. James I missed this a lot so this
hair is from an Alex press company
called peerless hair company and I've
had this hair for like five months so
this is gonna be a real in-depth review
um because I've had this hair probably a
lot of my most recent hair um I've had
I've been keeping for quite a long time
only because I just I'm kind of over the
I get the hair I wear for about a month
two months and then people be like okay
I got my hair too and I love it and then
after a month day hitting me up saying
my hair with two and I hate it so I just
been trying to keep it a little bit
longer than usual
um some companies are a little bit upset
but I do what I do for y'all so they met
oh well um so - this hair this is their
Peruvian kinky curly and I am wearing
four bundles of I believe 18 it's either
between 18 and 20 I believe it's 18
because this is a little bit long for me
for an 18 but maybe because I haven't
had it in quite some time
I don't know and then I have a well I
had as you can see a 20 I mean an 18
inch closure so you guys know I like the
big hair my look is very much as you
seen from my intro solid gold so I'm
standing up here
as you can see so my pants and my jacket
are from mosquito and this is from this
was in the Barbie collection - these
loud bangles are gold I got them from
forever 21 these earrings I got from the
beauty supply and as you probably can't
tell but it's a lot of gold going on in
my face and all of it I mean I have like
80 different gold highlighters from gold
deposit to champagne pop is on shout out
to Jacqueline ooh so so I decided to do
only because you know usually when I do
curly hair I usually do it in a side
part or a middle part so I wanted I've
only done this style once before for
this and this is when I did like my Rick
James I did it with a different company
and I just found that wig the other day
and I fell back in love I wash it in
conditioning pop right back
so this hair I bit like I said I've been
having this hair for five months when I
initially got it I wore it as because
they said they didn't have any frontals
so I said do whatever we only carry
closures and our closures are only
around 18 so if you're looking for our
curly closure and it's like you want
like a 20 inch one this may not
necessarily be for you and you're
looking for a front tool they may it's
been five months so they made cell
phones now I don't know but when I asked
him they said they did not carry them um
I would have liked this look with the
frontal because it would have been more
it would have been a little bit wider
and a little bit fuller here in the
front as you can see a little bit of my
forehead no friend now I did this look
because Halloween is upon us and a lot
of times I see people do like Oh disco
looks and they use those very cheap um
afros that you get from the beauty
supply or you get from you know the
Halloween store and um Party City is
cool but um if I was to do this and I
was going from somebody or me and my
crew was going from somebody from the
80s I definitely from their 70s or
ladies - I would definitely do something
more like this if I had like a low hat I
should be / to a rockstar one on one
while you're playing but um the lists
for these glasses will be at the bottom
- so as far as the the shedding goes for
this hair I surprisingly haven't got
much of anything of course when I
initially put them in I did not cut
these I just folded them over so I did
not cut them so I haven't experienced
crazy amounts of shedding like I would
some other hair that I've had thank God
far as the curl pattern goes when I did
get it I like said compared to you know
you first open a thing to top ramen or
cup of noodles and it just has that that
yeah it's just crazy that's what it
looks like
now it did say
when I looked at our previous emails its
tip stated the company gets all their
hair from its donor and it's all 100%
virgin hair however this hair is no
different from any other key curly hair
that I've ever had so either and some of
the hair that I've had in passes kinky
curly um it's still really good here I
just don't think it's virgin hair so
this hair I don't I don't necessarily
think it's virgin I wanted to bleach
this I was going to do it kind of like
Beyonce's hair was in Goldenberg I was
going to make it kind of a blonde mane
but then I didn't want to look too much
like a lion so I was like I'm just gonna
keep it as a natural color and a lot of
times companies do prefer that we keep
the hair in its natural state unless
it's like a 613 or something but all
abut I'm just going to keep it in its
natural state so this is what it's been
since I've had it
I had to curl the closure here in the
front because it was straight at the
roots so as you can see all of this I
wanted it to blend so this is the
natural pattern and I had to take my
wand and actually curl the front of this
only because it would not stay it just
looked limp it looked like I had um some
straight bangs and some curly hair which
I don't do okay so um as far as the
bundles go one of my bundles had you
know how when you get or you may not
know but sometimes when you get your
West they should be even on each side
meaning there should be no extra when
the hair stops the traction stop this
had more of a it was like a piece that
kind of dipped down and kind of had like
a shoelace
aglet at the bottom and you know the
little piece of the laplace piece and
kind of like that that was one bundle
that had it on both sides the rest of
them were fine um the closure itself was
a typical closure it was nothing crazy
different about this closure that I have
never got before it was a lace closure
um it was four by four I believe and it
was easy to bleach I originally bleached
the knots on it and I originally plucked
it because I had planned on a plan on
wearing this um like a middle part and
whole bunch of like just a big waves but
I did that look once before and I didn't
want to do it again I didn't want to do
anything with a part I wanted something
where if you are not well versed in
styling curly hair this would be another
option for you now this look could work
on a regular day however I did wear this
look to amusement park and I have my
adjustable strap in the back but because
it's not it like if you're gonna do this
at least glue it down or you know gots
to be glued it down in front because I
remember every time I get off a ride it
would just be you know it does got cute
but when I had this hair with during the
summer time so I wear it usually at
night only because in the daytime it's a
little too hot Plus this i'm aloha right
now the air was online so this is
definitely great for
the colder that it is much colder
outside like this is like christmas hair
this is hair when you're in new york and
you want to go to you know see the
lighting of the you know the christmas
tree
this would be great but i wouldn't
necessarily wear this style
now I'm not talking about the hey I'm
some of the style on a day where it's
going to be anything over 70 don't
anything over 65 don't um but overall I
don't get crazy amounts of tangling Aiko
washed his hair countless amount
sometimes I did do my strand test to
make sure that it was right so I'm not
you can you definitely can bleach it
like I said before I did intend on
winning to bleach it but I just didn't
want to like lying and then when it came
down to actually co washing it people
always asked I use the same conditioner
that I always use which is that Tresemme
rich uhm rich moisture shampoo
I mean rich moisture conditioner and I
like to use that because it holds the
curl it holds the body of the hair and
only thing I did with this particular
look is after I Co washed it I kind of
towel blotted it and then I took a
diffuser and on diffuses so that once I
because it's going to diffuse it's going
to kind of look more like this and then
you just take it and you start running
your fingers through it and the more you
run your fingers through it the bigger
is going to get so this is too big for
your liking or this is not
that you're going for just don't run
your fingers through it that much you
just don't you know don't finger comb it
as much and you'll be fine oh and in the
back okay just be careful in the back uh
with any hair any curly hair anyway the
air be make sure you I like to co wash
twice a week for stuff like this
especially that I'm wearing consistently
and I've been wearing this one
consistently only because it's just been
a little bit easier and I have to worry
about my hairline I have to worry about
anything I pop it on
go and call it a day when I'm done I put
it back on the mannequin head and call
it a day then once I worried about three
or four times I'll go ahead and call our
 do what I just explained to you
guys and call it a day but overall um
one to ten I'll give them a nine and a
half and the only reason I'm not giving
them the other half is because I didn't
like the fact that my frontal was not as
curly and I mean it was like curly at
the very very end I made my frontal my
closure so and in fact I didn't have any
frontal that was kind of the thing that
kind of turned me off which is like most
people get with it but I will say
overall I do like this hair but with any
hair they're definitely gonna have some
hangups because it depends on how you
take care of it so if you do get this
hair straight out the back make sure you
got the right conditioner the right
shampoo I like to use the coconut milk
shampoo um as well as a conditioner on
this type of hair as well that will work
fine just anything that is very
hydrating if anything strips the hair
you're going to end up with a matte and
that's no one's fault but yours so I
hope you guys liked my solid-gold
situation um and yeah let me know what
you guys are gonna be following I know
kind of what I'm gonna be I'm not sure
but I got like four options so let me
know and I'll catch you guys in my next
one
