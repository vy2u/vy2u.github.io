bit of a rant but this is not gonna be
like a rant about people or what it will
come to sort of but not really
okay this branch is about fucking sprint
the phone company and this is just not
stopping with sprint this goes for all
frickin phone companies pretty much so
y'all know that I went through if you
follow me on Twitter what you should
which is Adolphus Barney um and on
Facebook which is right here cuz that
link is long
um do y'all know that I was having a
real issue with trying to get my phone
replaced now I have insurance and I'm
still with them our one-year warranty
with Sprint okay so this weapon my phone
I have a blackberry my phone you guys
know I didn't want a blackberry I'd
never want it I just got the phone
because it was free and I promised
myself at the beginning of the year that
I would stop paying two to four hundred
dollars or follow every few months I was
like I'm trying to do things a little
bit differently
shouldn't did that because the one time
I didn't spend the money was the one
time I got fucked over so let's just get
to the point you're them so okay my
phone if anybody who has a blackberry
knows and I would not suggest that phone
any type of blackberry to anybody um it
started to freeze and then I kind of let
that go
then what ended up happening it started
to my screen will go white now spray say
they don't have no troubleshooting which
is basically when I try to fix the phone
over the damn phone they shake yourself
run over the regular phone um for a
white screen so I said okay whatever she
says so what you gonna do is you're
gonna go to a Sprint store talk to a
technician let's make sure that it has
no water damage and it's not your fault
and then we're gonna replace your phone
but you have insurance and you still
within your warranty so you're gonna be
good regardless I said okay fine I went
to the Sprint store on Melrose
something it's right off of Melrose
though it's a nice print store went up
in there Jude was like okay they looked
at my phone and it was like okay you
have no water damage we're gonna just
order you a new phone this was on a
Friday my phone broke on Thursday I went
there Friday morning he said we're gonna
owe you in the phone it should be here
Monday or Tuesday I said okay cool
I called Monday no phone I called
Tuesday no phone and he said the ladies
would be Wednesday I call Wednesday
every time I call mind you nobody asked
my name they just asked me what kind of
fun I had I'm sure I'm not the only
bitch in LA with a blackberry I can
guarantee I'm not the bitches are like
most Mobile's now everyone has one tone
I call them Wednesday and he was like oh
yeah you came in with the BlackBerry I
was like yeah he was like oh you'll be
getting it ordered the phone you got a
cause for him back so I waited all this
time a full weekend with no phone half
damn near half of a week with no phone
and yet and still you would could even
call me and let me know as you couldn't
water my phone so I was waiting for
nothing what you tell me stop cross
sprint I'm very upset now at this point
I had to get in my very very proper
woman voice because sometimes when you
get ghetto with them they don't really
get it but if you sound very much
educated and like you are going to write
a letter to the company then they get
what they get on it and so the first one
I'm not gonna lie I'll just start off
ghetto I'm not gonna lie so I I kept
explaining the story that I just told
y'all I was explaining to everybody that
they can't transfer me so they can't
trust me for this person to this person
so this person is this person so at this
point I asked for a manager I said can I
speak to a manager please because I'm
happy I'm happy I just pay my cell phone
bill my cell phone bill is like ninety
seven dollars a month for a whack-ass
blackberry it's like really or whatever
so I had never had issues with them
weapons at this point so then these
motherfuckers had the nerve to tell me I
said you know what y'all did send me
through the ringer I wanna see what I
can get what can you do for me
because I'm paying my bills on time and
in my contract agreement it says that as
long as I pay my bill on time I will get
service and great customer service from
you guys at Sprint PCS
the customer I mean the company because
the customer like me I was in a being so
what do they do they send me to four
different people at a time they see me
some four different people at a time
they kept transferring me I kept having
to tell the same sob a story then I got
mad say can I speak to a manager this
fucker gonna tell me that manager gotta
tell you the same thing I'm gonna tell
you I said I don't give a fuck what
you're talking about can I please get a
manager you know and it's like why do I
have to get ghetto for them to
understand me as a person and as a
customer as I just pay my fucking video
so I'm get transferred to this person is
profound to get after literally being on
the phone for about in a fucking hour
I finally get on the phone with the
manager they kept they kept on making it
up excuses this one dude was like cuz I
was like since I've been through all of
this I want a free upgrade I want my
bill I want something cuz this don't
make no fucking sense I I'm not the ones
that complain about shit I'm really not
but don't take me there don't fucking
push me so they pushed me
they pushed me off the fucking blade so
I was like okay um did you gonna tell me
were you not eligible for upgrading to
mm it's well I said we can all be dead
by that time the fuck is that gonna do
for me I really didn't mean it like that
but I was just pissed off you know I was
just mad so he had to chuckle I said
I'll see shit funny cuz it's simple fact
that y'all are trying to play me right
now Oh eat I want my fucking money
I want something so he ended up sending
me to it that finally sending me some
manager the manager calls the store the
store dude that told me they couldn't
bring I mean order my phone without to
lunch yeah so bullshit right it's just
like so he's like I'm calling you back
in 15 minutes so we can get this um
worked out I said okay cool whatever so
they're really trying to figure out like
is this really happening to me right now
like do I really have to go off the
manager never called me back
he never called me fucking back do you
know I sit there and waited he's coming
back in 15 minutes it was like 15
minutes after fucking 8 o'clock and you
know I never got a call so the next
morning I had to go through all of that
shit again all of that shit again do you
know I was fucking pissed off then this
bitch tried to insult my intelligence
and tell me that I would only be able to
get our $35 credit I said bitch you can
shut that shit up your ass somebody's
gonna give me something and I'm telling
you my pain and suffering his way work
for more than 35 funky-ass dollars you
won't pay my bill for a few fucking
months that's what's gonna happen so she
said I don't know what what you want me
to do because at this point you can't
get a free upgrade because you're not
eligible for an upgrade right now and
we're gonna just order your phone I
don't want the fucking phone no more
bitch you gonna do something from me cuz
I'm up fucking sick like how you going
to as the company tell me as a customer
that you can't do shit for me but order
me the same raggedy-ass phone that broke
the first time that's probably gonna be
somebody else's problem so here we go
again and just it was just like problem
after problem Springs has the worst
customer service known to man these
motherfuckers are rude and these are not
like t-mobile's our customer service
people where they like fucking in
Indonesia and shit they in California
they are fucking in Canada they in
fucking Texas and shit they are local
they they are not like no they're local
and they're fucking rude
I got one person who was nice to me
after I was transferred to about 10
people sprint you fucking suck and I'm
going to cancel that ass so quick don't
you don't understand out where they I
would rather be with AT&amp;amp;T and have no
service then be which are which are
raggedy-ass customer service like this
just doesn't make any sense
you hate all this and this is not just
sprint this is a lot of other companies
too
because I'm a t-mobile when the first
sidekick came out and it's like he too
came out I would have problems what they
asked from sunup to sundown about my
phone and they would act like it was my
fucking fault it's like it's my fault
cuz your service don't work that don't
make no sense to me
it wasn't my fault when you got my
motherfucking bill money and I wasn't
cuz that's what's wrong was acting like
oh yeah I said I never ever been fucking
late on my bill bitch I always pay my
shit overtime three four five or week
before it's due and you want to sit up
here and act like I did something
fucking wrong but you can kiss my nice
pretty light-skinned ass cuz this
doesn't make any sense if you are
working at Sprint I just want to let you
know that I'm a very unhappy customer so
let me just get to the digits of the
story so after going through this I
finally got a nice nice customer service
rep she was really nice I don't remember
her name if another person tweet me I'm
a fucking die um and she was you know
she was really nice she said we're gonna
make sure that we handled this situation
today accordingly I'm gonna make sure I
put everything in the computer that has
happened to you so basically cut to the
chase my bill for the next three months
will be $11.97 let's just say that okay
so um I'm happy I didn't get my upgrade
remember I was on on Facebook stalking
my husband give me an Evo no I didn't
give me no Evo but they gave me a credit
and my bill is real cheap so I'm happy
about that so if you are with Sprint and
they are giving you fucking Punk bitch
ass problems complain complain and keep
calling because they're gonna give your
ass something for free because it
doesn't make it it's not like I wanna
get something for free cuz I don't wanna
pay my bill I have the cellphone I made
the agreement so I'm gonna pay it like
the adult that I am supposed to that's
not the point
sure when I have to go into my Valley
Grove ways in order to get some good
assistance it doesn't make any sense and
I have to use words like preposterous
and you know just outrageous in order to
get people's attention to believe what
I'm saying it just doesn't make it just
is just stupid it's just through and I
and we pay all of this money for a
fucking 30 days service like every
we shelving out extra money like I know
not frying hard fucking cell phone bill
is like a hundred and something like who
the fuck are you trying to ET like phone
home bTW like what are you trying to do
like why don't you build so much why are
you guys charging this much for phone
services it just doesn't make it just
doesn't make sense
so I understand why people have Boost
Mobile and metro pcs and shit because
they don't give you problems they just
go hey this is your money you can pay
the shit when you want to cool I can't
do that cuz they go Nokia phones but
yeah um I'm so done with sprint you guys
you guys don't understand it soon as
soon as I get everything that I'm doing
done I'm cancelling ass
I might go to Verizon I'm trying to
avoid 18 see who else is that the only
companies that are here now because
everything else to fuckin shit down so
as Verizon AT&amp;amp;T
oh I don't fuck it with t-mobile could
t-mobile and fucking ATT about to be the
same fucking company now anyway so yeah
I y'all my cell phone experience has
been shitty straight shape I can't
believe that they really tried me like
he was like city man it was like so what
do you want me to do you know like what
do you want and didn't know let me see
they transfer me to the fucking UM sales
department and she was like well I can't
really do nothing for you cuz I think I
can do is tell you something and I can
say you a new phone but I'm sure you
don't want to pay that I said why are
y'all trying to give more money out of
me
I want my fucking phone like I'm not
trying to buy a new one I don't want to
give you our no more money I might not
never get that shit neither so I ended
up they ended up shipping me the phone
it came the next day um all my shit was
in there I'm like it was supposed to be
where he came within time after I
activated the phone um now I'm not
getting my calls people are calling me
and it's just saying oh you got a new
voicemail I never got the call so yeah
I'm gonna get another fucking crazy -
cuz somebody's gonna do something cuz
this doesn't make no sense for your
phones to be so fucking faulty and your
service to be so fucking way like I
thought but I got used to have Sprint
when we have the flip phones remember
like I think it was like a sanyo
Friday I still got that fucking phone in
my room but Thrym was good when they
joined forces with next tail they fucked
up like up like up like I don't I just I
am so over this and having a cell phone
like it's just too much but anyway I
just want to let y'all know about my mom
and I know y'all can relate to this I
know
oh ho because I see the tweets about
Java VM not working and how y'all gotta
fuckin shortage in your phone and
bitches act like they don't know what
happened yes brain so yeah if you are a
representative or owner or whatever just
know I'm a very unhappy fuckin customer
