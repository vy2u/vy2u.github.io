rocking is from a company I've never
worked with before but this wig looks
very familiar - like a review before and
this company is called premier lace wigs
they sent me this particular unit looks
like my other one that I did it's the
same I think it's the same specs so let
me get into those real quick um the
number is FL w - B - D V the hair is
virgin brazilian so usually when it's
virgin brazilian or as a brazilian body
wave or a brazilian deep wave to it if
you like run your fingers through the
arm curls like this it's going to end up
giving you this very natural situation
as you can see like right here
this is what the natural texture of it
was when I received it and I just pretty
much I just took my hand my fingers and
just ran them through all of the curls
that were in twirl the wave really that
was in it so it's a natural color so
when it is a natural color it usually
means that it's a 1b which I'm almost
certain this is it's not black I mean
it's not jet black but you can see is
browner as I get closer so I let you
know that it has more of a natural
natural color to it and this is a deep
body wave so well there was a deep body
way before I ran my fingers through all
of these so of course when you receive
and she was not wear it like it came out
of the package is not a really
attractive look but like my other wig
this one is pretty much the same the
only difference between that wig and
this one is the wig is shorter this one
it just happens to be 24 inches but
again this is for the people who don't
really want a lot of maintenance who
just want to kind of throw it and go you
don't really want to have to have too
much to do in the morning when you go
out or you just want to swing it because
it is getting hotter you can I know my
other one
I used that week for Valentine's Day so
I had to warlock all my Barbie mosquito
stuff and I had the headband so I put it
on and then I had like half of it up and
then the other half was down in the back
um because his hair is so light and airy
it is it's not hard to put it's not
heavy on your head like it gives you a
very natural I have some nice curly hair
get down when I receive the wig it also
came with the paper with I think this is
all the information that comes with and
about the wig and I think they're also
haircare instructions in here as well
the length is 24 inches the color is of
course a natural color my cap is a small
the density is a normal weight density
with switz lace adjustable straps in the
back comes in 1 1b or 2 as a hundred and
20 density and my other one said that
too I just don't know how true that is
because I feel like well I know if I
straighten his hair is not gonna be full
like this it's gonna get pen straight
and be probably very thin it's a very
pretty unit um it's a very this is
another one of my easy go wigs like you
know this is where you can run to the
store in this and feel like okay so
summertime I just want to have a moment
to just be natural and flowy but it's
still a wig it also they also sent me a
pair of free lashes which these are good
when you're doing looks like Barbie
looks or doll looks you can use these
for your bottom lashes so I will be
using these just on the land and then it
also came with this came with this new
weaving cap which I don't
I still don't understand why these
companies continue to sin weaving and
mesh caps with lace wigs if I did park
this which I didn't do but if I did what
a pardon is then you have been able to
tell and see you know where it's just
it's not a good option okay and then
it's also came with their pamphlet and
you can scan the front here if you want
to give more info and they have an
affiliate program so I think this goes
for everyone you can earn up to 5
percent commission on every sale that
you refer to us so pretty much if you
buy a wig or review wig and then
why you can use an affiliate code and
100 points equals one credit 800 points
equals a credit or credit means dollar
amounts at 2,000 credits I mean 2,000
points equals 20 credits so that's 20
dollars
so yeah this is kind of like how other
companies have it where they can you can
pretty much keep track of who's buying
who's not buying who's just looking
who's talking but yeah this is cool I
just wish one thing it doesn't have and
I wish that it had it with some homes
cuz you know when you have hair like
this you would you know throw it to one
time you want to do a whole bunch of
other stuff and then if your real hair
starts showing in your cap cuz I got
like a new cap or under here you could
see it so that's not really attractive
so I wish there would have been some
combs or at least um some extra combs
that came in a back I mean in a box
which it did not but I have so many
combs from so many different leaks that
I've had I could just go ahead and sew
like 18 in here and I'll be pretty fine
other than that though it is it's nice
here this is the hair that's easy to
wash cuz my other one I washed it and
after I had like pretty much left it
like this for a while and I threw it in
a box you know it wanted to kind of
low-key wanna nap up on me only because
I just threw it there and it was being
shuffled around but as soon as I some
water hit it and then I let it air dry
it went right back to this they say is
24 inches and because it has a texture
to it I would like to believe that is 24
it might be it just might be a thin 24
if you try to go ahead and straighten it
it's just not gonna be as full but yeah
so this is from from ear lace wigs make
sure you guys check all the info at the
bottom and let me know what you think
about this particular wig
I like these you know like a lot of my
natural girls and natural boys out there
who like natural hair this will be
perfect because it gives you it's so
soft that's the thing it's so soft but
it's also gonna give you a very natural
this is my hair filled without the
tracks and the blending nothing I did
was left on my edges right here in the
firm that's it it's just sitting right
about here but yeah if you just want
that natural feel see my scalp my
stocking cap is right here so if I pull
it back you'll be able to see it if I
had a comb right here I wouldn't be
having a problem but it's cool
but yeah um again it's the natural look
and if you are a natural girl natural
boy or using once I'm a natural looking
hair I think this would be actually very
perfect and it's realistic because of
the length it's not as long as my other
one so my other was a little bit bigger
but I do like this one too as a nice
alternative so I'll talk to y'all in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
