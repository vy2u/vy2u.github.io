different I'm sure because one I've
never had a short curly get down like
such and I usually have my room in the
background not a backdrop however I just
moved so everything is everywhere so
excuse that so for now we're gonna do
the backdrops but this week that I have
one it is from premier lace wigs this is
a wig that I picked out myself and I've
actually grown to really like because
it's loud and it's thick and it's full
and it's curly and it's effortless like
you really don't have to do much with
this so again this is from premier lace
wigs and I'm gonna give you the stats
and the info on this puppy this is
called their Hollywood glamour short
hair style which I really like because
this definitely gives you a kind of old
Hollywood cuz you know they used to curl
in here overnight for three days real
thick and it'll be full and curly like
this it was more uniform when I got it I
haven't behind my hairline as you can
see so it's behind our hairline is here
this is where it starts and I put a
little concealer in the part just to
make it look a little more realistic I
put on this is the dress that comes with
my Alice in Wonderland costume so I just
dip with the apron ones because I'm a
feel I mean I already feel like a member
of the help but you know so I just
wanted to achieve this like babydoll
type of look cuz that's what I feel like
it is I should have put my group mama
blue contacts in that would have been
smart I like this so as far as the wig
goes it's very easy to apply the curls
when I got them they had like these it
was this and instead of you know sending
it to me with curlers they send it to me
with these and I have the bobby pin
attached to the curl so that I was able
to keep these curls and they wouldn't
fall I'll be flattening but how I
received the wig which I thought was
very smart I wouldn't
to do that I've always just brought a
whole buncha rollers and gave him away
why not um the hair texture is very soft
a very very soft it did shed when I was
combing through it I've seen it on my
bathroom counter but I don't think it
was alive it didn't it wasn't a whole
bunch but it was a nice amount that was
shedding but you know that comes with
anyway especially wigs that you haven't
had that long alone II had this wig for
about a month and yeah it's held up very
well I will say these curls I have not
recur I hate curling short hair so this
is actually great that this is stayed up
and stayed this fluffy and this tight
this long I am overdue for a wash
because arias 30 it's 12 inches and it's
endearing hair so it's human hair that
you can curl and straighten it's only 12
inches so I'm sure if you straighten
this is gonna be a bob I don't know how
thick it would be because judging by the
curls
it feels really full but that always
falls you it could be a very very very
very thin unit if you do to it which
you're not supposed to do to it which I
don't believe this is a meant to be
straightening but if you want to you go
ahead and try it and see when you
receive it you know how it works out for
you but okay so far so good I like this
I don't think I'm trying you guys know I
am definitely a creature of habit so
long hair is something that I'm used to
and I love so very much but after my
short wig I just wanted to try something
a little bit different so um you guys
need to like this baby doll I wish I had
my Alice in Wonderland headband I
definitely would have did a a little
cuteness to the added a little cuteness
to this situation but I love this though
so we're going to get to the specs of
the wig itself again the hair type is an
indie remy the length is 12 inches the
color is the natural color and as you
can see in the camera it is like a
natural Brown it's not black and
definitely I feel like to do was all the
way black this will come off like I have
made the cap size is a medium is an
average now you guys know I usually get
a size small so as you can see
from company to company the size is
definitely very every small is not the
same small from every company so that's
something to look look into as well how
do they fit shoe the size I have a small
head in a big face so usually a small
works for me but this medium is actually
great it doesn't feel saggy or baggy or
anything it actually fits very tight
like a small should the density on this
wig this is 180 so you could probably
straighten it then what I want to
straighten this no could I straighten
this yes um but I'm not cuz I like this
like I really do like this and I don't
want to ruin any of the curls that are
already in it so I won't be
straightening this because this is
definitely how I intend on wearing this
my lace color is a light brown and
there's three inches of parting space
right here in the front so this is where
its top so all of this you can part but
because everything is so tight you can
get away with it only being it if it's a
straight leg this will look kind of
Wiggy but because it's not a straight
wig it actually looks natural like okay
you just got a part and then you got
some real real real curly fide hair but
yeah guys let me know what you think
again this is from premier lace wigs and
you guys know I love their wigs I just
recently started working with them and I
could not be any happier with their
service cuz they're actually very nice
and their understanding and they're
giving me a chance to try something
different because when I because I've
reviewed so many hairstyles companies
like to see what I've done with other
companies and be like can you do this
price and I'm like I have that same wig
in that same texture and all of that so
I really would like something different
so let me know what you guys think and I
will put all the promotional information
below as well as link and I would catch
y'all in the next peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
