at this
let your tongue so fun how many nanana
nana neyni rollin with me me me me me me
me toes lip up lamp again a nanny me ask
my daddy yeah this is from from your
last weeks this is a luxurious kinky
hair which is very similar let me closed
to the Italian Yankee I mean I think it
might actually be the same thing the
only difference is this is a lace front
not a full lace wig so of course you
guys know there is a difference I just
wanted a really tall ignorant ponytail
just because I was watching scream
queens and that's like my new favorite
show now and Ariana Grande where it's
the same style all the time so I said -
I know the creepy colors
so I decided to opt and say I'm just
gonna put my hair in a nice little cute
ponytail this week so again this is a
fool wait
but it's only a lace front and in the
front of it actually is so base so it's
only so based from like here to about
here it's not a lot which that's why
they don't really up to what are we
really parted and this style didn't
require much of anything you just Park
the back of your hair and you just I
taped mines down with its double-sided
tape I know a lot of you guys all we got
some left what kind of tape do you use
to keep your hair down and why the why
does your hair not go anywhere because
if I use double-sided tape then you can
just put it on your hair line which is
on your stocking cap then once you put
it on you just put the end of the hair
on it behind your hairline and then you
just slick your hair with some extra
dollars in jail into a nice little high
pony like such this hair of course it's
very low maintenance it's not really
much that I need to do it there due to
the simple fact that it's what it is
it's not really crazy um you can of
course straightness if you want to if
you wanted more of a natural look this
definitely would all work with that if
you wanted more of you could actually
wanna curl this and have like more of
natural curl like natural
girls versus more uniform because it'll
have more of like this little puff to it
and definitely something that I love I
love all my like Italian kinky wigs
because they're more natural um
the only thing that I don't like about
this is the fact that it's not for lace
and you guys know I'm not really a lace
front type of person so it's really
difficult for me to be like oh I love
the lace front cuz I don't um and it's
not the wig that I don't like it's just
the fact that it's the lace front in
general which I wasn't aware of when I
received it so that's kind of a bummer
like I knew it was gonna be like a kinky
texture but I don't know it was gonna be
just the lace front I thought it won't
be a full lace way in still top but
don't work because actually have one
that I'm gonna do a style one that I
already have now so the length of this
is actually 24 inches so 24 inches and
this is 24 inches in the actual the
texture so if this was straight it would
probably stop right here but because
it's not straight it's that's a little
higher up which is cool I don't you know
I don't mind it it still looks natural
it's still got length on it it's not
like it's super short or anything King
in the color is a natural color so this
is a natural Brown this is not a jet
black or anything this is definitely a
natural Brown which is more close to my
real hair color than like a 1 or even or
sometimes even a 1b this will not be
like more between a 1 being a 2 so the
density and you guys know the density oh
in more of a natural way like kinky or
Italian yaki some a lot of times it's
very different from the kinkiness that
is of that of like a straight kinky
which would moreso be like a light yaki
like this is not the same so the density
for this is a 120 as opposed to 100 so
it feels it'll be a hundred for this
texture but it's 120 overall if that
makes any sense so basically what I'm
saying is you'll put more hair because
the hair texture of what it is but
technically it's still the same if I
strain it it will still be more like a
100 density than a 120 it's just a
little bit more because the hair is a
little
thicker lace color which you guys should
have seen in the tutorial that I did you
will see that the lace color is by Brown
and the silk top color is more of a a
lightish bra is mark scalpel uh pretty
much it has three combs in it which is
here and then is two on a side and then
there's an adjustable strap in the back
which actually really helps I'm not one
to usually wear my adjustable straps but
because I usually wear my hair down but
because I had to like you know this is
not coming from my scalp so therefore
when you put a wig on
I mean you pull it it's gonna want to
come up so what I have to do is I have
to go ahead and pretty just two straps
on tape it down then put it in the
ponytail so yeah that's kind of the only
thing that I didn't really like is
because um the combs word not it helped
but it didn't you know it didn't help
not for this style it didn't I had to
really do something I had to actually
have somebody hold my head then I put it
in the ponytail then let it go cuz
otherwise it would've just look crazy it
does I mean if you were to wear this as
you should have seen in the tutorial if
you wear this like in a natural style if
you like body this down in the front
it has like the dividends of a hairline
it's not crazy or anything but it's
definitely not to me it doesn't look
natural so I always offer my own hair
line I'm not really one for the fake
hair lines because even if you pluck
them they always look like Barbies hair
lines and as much as I love Barbie and I
would love to be a wearing one day I
just don't want her hair line because
that's one of the one of the most
unattractive then just that edged up
thick hair line is not attractive so I
mean you can get this out everybody a
moment wearing you can eat the style of
the wig
you can you don't have to do it with a
leaf so it could look natural now I
would try this with stray hair I would
try this for curly hair it just kind of
depends on what I want to do I
definitely ain't mad at that you know it
definitely gives me this natural just
wash my hair I don't feel like doing it
but I'm about to go out and get crunk at
the club feel my silk base if I didn't
mention it is four by four which is
pretty standard and pretty normal with
no base closures or silk base of wigs I
really wish there was like a entire
school basically from front to back
that'll be everything to me but I get to
run into that but if you know career
last week that y'all looking at you're
watching a fool so base wig I'm down for
trust me it's necessary
this however is a bluelist you know so
if I was you I personally wouldn't bomb
this down unless it was necessary and I
think you know I mean you could know
what you want to do I'm just not one for
the bluing but tape works you know what
it is well you know um if you guys are
interested in this Union make sure you
guys go to the links better below and I
will talk to y'all later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
