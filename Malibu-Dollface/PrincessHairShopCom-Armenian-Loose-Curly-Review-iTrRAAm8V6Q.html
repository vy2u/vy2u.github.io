my princess hair shop Armenian hair I
received his hair probably about a month
ago
I've had this hair for quite some time
but I just haven't had a chance to put
it in I did the you part when I first
got it but I haven't had a chance to put
it in and actually wear it because I've
been in and out of different reviews and
yeah I just been trying to get myself
together and I've been in inside part
and I really wanted to do this here with
a middle part because it's so beautiful
it curls so great and I actually did
these curls with flexi rods and no
curlers except for the top part because
it didn't curl right last night but you
know we had an earthquake let I'm gonna
talk about that okay so anyway yeah this
hair comes from Princess hair shop I
have in I think I'm not for sure but I
believe I having two 2824 weight having
to 28th of 23 or 25 and a 21 so they
they're basically giving you on here
they're giving you true to lane sizes so
sometimes you'll put on some people will
put on their side we have 20 inches and
then you get it sometimes it's 19 inches
or it's 21 inches depending on how did
you know I'm saying how they're
measuring it but yeah
each card when you receive your hair
each car comes with hair care
instructions on the back and this
basically explains to you how to
maintain your hair this is very
important to read because a lot of times
people will buy hair a different origin
they don't know what it is they probably
come straight out of pack hair and they
don't know how to take care of virgin
hair they don't how to take care of hair
that is not meant to be washed with
dollars while
and dollar conditioner you know I'm
saying so this tells you on the back it
says upon receiving your princess hair
shop choose a quality moisturizing
conditioner and oil and deep condition
your hair a lot of products to remain on
the hair for a few hours in a plastic
bag or container please do not use
Herbal Essence slash organics Moroccan
conditioner now they explain to you what
not to use so if you use this in your
hair mattes up or whatever situation is
that's on you
you have to understand these hair care
instructions from any company are very
important because they know the origin
of which hair you've basically been sold
and they're trying to have you have a
long lifespan of the hair when you order
anything for princess hair shop they
give you this particular they explain to
you that your hair is guaranteed it's a
year guarantee and basically your hair
will guaranteed to last for a year or
longer if it does not they will replace
your hair so if you have any issues or
if you have any problems or whatever
situation is you can always feel free to
contact them they're dope side they're
one of the very few sites that actually
do this because some people feel like
once it's out of their hands they no
longer have any dealings with the hair
like we don't know what you did to it so
princess Tara actually gives you an
opportunity to fix anything that they
personally have done wrong you know on
their behalf now when I receive the hair
it came like this this is on this all
the hair I have left it has like a
slight wave to it I posted a picture on
Instagram of what the hair looked like
when I first got it had this it was
really big because it was all these
waves
I flat ironed it with my roommate in
flat iron then I curled this last night
excuse me with flexi rods I received a
closure with this as well a 14 inch
closure to go with it and I wanted to
try excuse me
I wanted to try IVs a flip-over method
with the closure but I just hadn't got
around to it because I had thought about
this after the fact when I did after I
got my braids done I already did the u
part he was just sitting I was like I
really want to try it but the u parts
too wide for me to get cuz I think my
braids stop right here this is all my
hair everybody always asks me am I
wearing a closure when I wear my hair
like this because of right here but if I
do this my hair is gonna look like a
lake so I have to push some of this back
because you know I have a widow's peak
so my hair comes further down than
normal so now I'm not wearing a closure
right now but it does look like I am
this is actually all mine this is all my
leave out right here if you want to know
how I got my leave out so straight I
just pressed it flat ironed it and then
put some umm people were asking what
this was this is my beyond the zone turn
up heat spray this is heat protecting
spray but it also works as a sheen spray
to help your hair day lay down and then
I just used a little bit of my grey
Flutie's hair spray and then just laid
it down like that and it stays so yeah
it looks really good
my hair is growing back a lot cuz I had
it was kind of short at the top cuz I
was like burning it out damn near
because I wasn't using enough heat
protecting when I had my last middle
part so they grew out a lot cuz my
braids came like were like this with my
side part so yeah I I did I did have to
cut some of the hair and the reason not
the ends though I didn't have to cut the
ends the ends actually were very far
very full they're very pretty but I did
have to cut some layers into it cuz it
wouldn't look like this if I would have
just left it straight and that's the
only thing I hate about happen to cut
hair and I have to do this with all here
because if you don't cut it and it's not
going to
you this it's not gonna have this
layered effect it's not gonna have this
it's just gonna be straight or your
curls are gonna be at the bottom so I
only I didn't cut as much as I usually
cut I kind of left it kind of basic and
big I didn't really want to cut a lot
off this part is is driving me wild but
other than that though I didn't have to
cut much off at all it's in a natural
color the natural color is like a brown
color my hair is a brown color so it
actually matches very well you really
can't see your tail where my hair stops
compared to the actual weave which is
great because nobody wants to know your
business like that well nobody should
know your business like that but this is
how the hair looks when you comb through
it these curls are so beautiful so yeah
and this is what it looks like it's a
really pretty hair like it's really
really it reminds me a lot of my Russian
hair that I have from them but it's just
not as full as the Russian hair like the
Russian hair was super for and that's
because of the density of it the density
of the hair is they're very thick but
other than that I really really love
this I really can't say anything more
about it cuz it's just great like when
you have quality hair that doesn't give
you any problems it's hard to kind of
say a lot about it when I did cut it cuz
I had to cut the top of obviously you
see I had to cut the top left everything
else is folded in the back but at the
top I didn't have the cut it shed it a
little bit but it wasn't crazy it wasn't
like you know like I was it was a mane
of hair everywhere but it did I did have
a nice amount of hair that did come out
but now like I said as I have it in now
I don't have any as you if I don't do
this I don't have any thing coming out
so that's good though because the simple
fact that nobody wants a hair all over
the place
I remember when I was in beauty school
and we were violent cheap hair like
bobby balls and Zuri and all that that
hit will be everywhere be in the carpet
and the tub and the shower because it
just it's the way it's put on the left
it's horrible the way that is you know
it is not of quality so therefore you're
gonna be able it's gonna just start
dropping like flies everywhere
of the West on these are really good too
they're flat they're not doubled up you
know like sometimes you get here it's
like a weft here and then it's like one
right here to try to make the hair look
thicker they're actually they're
actually pretty thin which I love and
then they also have like they also are
very tight like nothing is loose about
them and I you know sometimes you get
web-savvy crooked
thread be showing none of these have had
any of those so that's really good that
means that this hair is gonna last and
that's probably why I didn't shed if at
all when I was putting it in only at the
top because I actually cut it and I have
a tendency not to click like when I'm
really trying to rush like instead of
doing this and then couldn't I'll just
find a piece and cut and then obviously
you couldn't smear so yeah
but other than that the lustre in this
hair is really nice too it's not too
shiny but it does match with mine so
that's what I do like about it because
you know sometimes when you have to
figure out how you're gonna get your
hair to blend with that hair because
it's two different shades and two
different Luster's that's kind of look
so but other than that I love it thank
you princess hair shop for this thank
you for everybody who's watching and
everybody who like my other hair my um
my blue hair cuz I got that from them as
well my blue velvet I loved it I'm gonna
put the hair back in actually and I'm
gonna do the top like a darker like a
let me shut up cuz you know somebody's
gonna take it before I do it and then
that's gonna be a problem but yeah let
me just shut up wait anyway I will be
putting my other princess hair shop hair
back in after I wear this hair out but
if you have any questions or whatever
let me know and I will get back to you
I'll put all the information to this
hair and everything that I use to do it
down below and I will talk to you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
