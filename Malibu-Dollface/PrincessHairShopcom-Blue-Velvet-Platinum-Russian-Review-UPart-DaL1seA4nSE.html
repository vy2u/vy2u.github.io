boy okay just to let you go just like a
fYI you guys I've been getting over a
serious cold right now so if I sound
like really bad please excuse me I'm
sorry
um but alters the review for this
beautiful hair that I have in which is
from Prince's hair shop they contacted
me probably about a month ago cuz a
hypothetical question time and they
asked me to do a review and they told me
to pick anything on the site that I
would um so I went on the side I call
you through the site and I seemed that
they had this new luxe read and I was
going towards the red but then I was
like um IV just did red and you know red
seems to be like the thing right now so
I don't want to do that so I wanna do
something like a little bit you know
just a little bit different kind of
changing them you don't wanna watch
videos from the same company and
everybody's doing the same thing you
know so I said I do want to do you guys
know singer Kelis if you guys know
police do you guys know that um during
her first album sheddeth a video call
get along with you and in limiting her
hair was like a green color and I've
loved that hair forever and I was like I
do want to do something like that so
what I did was I researched a door and
see what colors that they have because
it was the only color that sticks in my
opinion when it comes down to hair like
this so when I come through the site
I've seen that they had a it was
platinum blonde with the tracks however
the roots were probably about three
inches of like black so you know
everybody's doing the dark roots with
the lighter hair it was kind of like
that so okay I'm gonna do something like
that because what I didn't want is I
didn't want to look like a oMG girl like
that was what my goal was like I just
want to look a hood and hey you never
say like that's never do that sounds
like I don't want to UM go light from
the roots all the way down I just kind
of wanted to do something kind of
towards the mother like it alright but
not really an arm brain but an armory if
that makes any type of embraces so why
did was I told them that I want the hair
the hair came here
beautiful that like whoever did the
color did an amazing job because
everything was even the hair was still
soft and the thing that I didn't want to
do with I didn't want to get dark hair
strip it's bleach it and then color on
it because taking hair through all of
that when you're just not in the mood
you you know I've been colored hair my
own hair for years however it's not a
process that I enjoy to do is not a
process that I wanted to do I wanted to
make this much easier for myself so our
idea was I waited research took two
colors that I wanted which was a
Nakamoto aquamarine and a by indigo blue
unfortunately you can't really see the
bed it's blue it looks more purple than
blue which freaking sucks but as you can
see this the back is awesome aqua marine
and the top is of blue color so I did my
to bottom bundles are the green aqua
aqua what is wrong that aquamarine color
and then my two top bundles are the
indigo blue but the indigo blue started
it looks more purple than it does but
they bleed I just wanted to colors that
we're very close in color so in with the
contrast was not huge you know so that's
why I did the blue at the top to kind of
blend in more so with the black the hot
my hair is still been blue-black this
would have been like SuperDuper
everything but I still do like it um the
hair is still soft the leg as you can
see as I it does this and I've curled
his hair flat-ironed it and it's still
giving me absolutely positively no type
of issues which I love like I like our
hair that doesn't give me any issues
when it comes down to like how soft it
is the lustre is great in the hair it's
giving me no problems which I love the
most because nothing is worse than
getting some hair that gives you more
more issues than it needs to so you see
it still does all in every it's really
soft and bouncy and nice and that's what
I love so much about it is that it
doesn't give me any issues it doesn't
give me any problems
what I did was when I colored it I put
it um I put each bundle I put two
bundles per zip lock bag and I'm prepare
how I left the little you know the
little twisty things that come on the
West when you get them I left those
orange and they're pretty much what I
did was I checked the bottle and I put
all the color on there I color really
really good and then I put it in the bag
and then I did that for it was too far
every two bundles per bag and then I put
the access that was on the time I had to
use all of the color they basically had
to use a bottle for bundle cuz that's
the only way it was going to work cause
it was not enough it was I guess you
could say it wasn't enough color for two
for me to saturate it and then with this
hair being already blonde if I would
have not really saturated it then the
color would have not went all the way
through and then I would have had those
you know some people at the end it'd be
like a pale color I don't want that I
wanted everything to be evenly colored
so what I ended up doing was um I when I
put it in there I let it sit for about
24 hours it was about it was a while I
looked the hair stick because I didn't
want it I didn't really disturb it I
wanted to let it you was gonna do what's
craziest I've never used a door to this
point I let it sit as long but when I
let it stay when I was there there was
no bleeding like literally and look like
I've put conditioner on the colored hair
and nails rinsing the conditioner out
like the color stuff so if you ever
color hair it's really blonde here Lacey
for at least 24 hours in the ziplock bag
and I promise you your color will come
out as vibrant as is because as you guys
probably seen in the clips before this
hair was like white like it was I mean
was a light but it was pretty light and
then you can see how this color is like
every single strand has color on it and
you know doesn't take a rocket science
to do you know do it but however it is
easier to mess up than it is to get
right so yeah I didn't have no issues
with it
I've had this hair like I said for a
while it doesn't really give me too many
strands this
is for me this is as much hair as I lost
and this is from really cutting it
because I had to put layers in the front
so I was cutting it and brushing through
it or whatever but other than that
though I love it
like I can't there's nothing bad that I
can honestly say about this you guys
know how I am I give honest reviews I
don't lie I'm not as I stood up here
that was so wonderful and it's not no
like it literally is great hair some of
the best hair that I've had thus far
this is actually rushin a rushin hair
which I've never had before and I love
it I think it's great it's very similar
to Philip Philip II know because of the
density so it's very thick but it's not
too thick it's still light enough you
know so it does that it's not just
weighing you down and I will say that
this is some of if not the best hair
that I've ever Flatiron
because when I flutter on his hair it
went straight like in the first path it
was straight I don't have to keep going
over it I didn't have to keep it was
just straight which I probably will wear
this I was gonna work straight but I
decided not to because I thought it
would look better with curls um so yeah
I love it though like I hope y'all livin
cuz I love it
I'm not really a person that comes off
when I was in beauty school I my hair
was this color it was this color it was
red it was color no it was every color
and when I left beauty school I dyed my
hair black and I've been having black
hair ever since so I think for me going
back to a little bit of color was it was
a good thing because back in the day
this is what people used to define me as
it's like when I was in food the clients
would know me as the positively R so
yeah um I love it if you guys have any
questions please let me know big shout
out to Brinson princess hair shop
because the owner is amazing she's the
stunt like she's super duper cool which
I love and she's just like how other
companies that I've worked with they've
been really cool we've Khmers we talked
we we taught each other Instagram that's
full of business that you want when you
can feel at one with your customer you
can bill it one with the person it feels
good because it's like okay this person
actually cares this person it's not like
Hiller dual review is shut up
they're like how you been here what's
going on I'm like you know she didn't
rush me to do because you know I got
sick and before that I had just put the
hair in and out of here so she knew it
wasn't gonna be immediately after I got
to here because it's just not like
putting black hair in she did rush me
she didn't give me no problems and
that's what I love because I love the
fact that I can take my time to do
something this amazing that comes out
this great and unfortunately other
companies don't do that
you know they just really like so you
know you got it all Tuesday will be
about next to them gonna be a buffer on
a it's just like yeah I've messed my
face on the concrete yeah I'm gonna need
time to recover
you know but it's only been like one
company that's been that to me um but
not maybe but yeah I love it
another thing that I do want to say is
well when you are coloring the hair make
sure that if you want let's just say I
wouldn't my this color to be lighter
which you could use is you can use some
conditioner and if you put the
conditioner in the color the conditioner
is gonna make the color lighter so I
couldn't didn't like a pastel but that's
not the look that I was going for it at
least not this time around maybe next
time maybe like a pink color or
something but I'm not don't think I'm
about to go a bit crazy with colors
because I'm not gonna do that
oh I do like my bright here I too but I
did like this do something a little bit
different in something a little off the
wall well like I said I have um indigo
blue and this indigo blue and aqua
marine I got it that's hot
oh well yeah my nose is killing me the
whole roster situation at all but if you
love the hair a sums up this video which
I'm nervous very very wide eyed I mean
it hears everything
Kayla hears everything um and I'll talk
to you guys later
