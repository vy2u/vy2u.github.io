wearing currently is actually hair that
I've worn before I don't remember how
long ago
I've might have been back March but I
did a video called blue velvet and um I
had a middle part and I had leave out at
the time since then I've got a subways
closure to go with this you know thanks
closure store and I just dyed the
closure it was all blonde it was all
bleached blonde like his hair originally
was you know the hair is from princess
hair shop but the closure is from
closure story and um I think idea was I
pretty much color the roots black and
then did the rest of the color blue and
aquamarine now listen when I originally
did this um you couldn't tell but there
are two different colors like this is
blue and then this is the aquamarine
color but in the video you couldn't tell
the difference now you can see what I
was saying like it's two different
colors so yeah this hair has been washed
once um since and I didn't add any more
color so I'm I don't you guys I was like
I left this in for like 82 hours okay
this is why I tell you guys to leave
your color in this long because when you
leave it in this long it will last like
this and it's still shiny the luster is
nice and it's now dry wasn't dry it ah
deep conditioned it and yeah I'll pop
this puppy right under still in the same
cap it was I just made it crooked and
then I put I sold my closure down first
and then I play my you part on well yeah
this is just an update on his hair
because a lot of you acts like whatever
happened to blue velvet um and yeah and
this is Bluebell okay people want to
know like what happened to blue velvet
like you I haven't seen you wear the
hair I wore this hair after the fact
it's just that I don't wear them on
camera because I'm always switching out
hair and all of that
well yeah it's still pretty it's still
thick it's still beautiful no shedding
which is I don't know if I still tease
works or not a kid in our caucus
was a minute ago so I don't recall but
yeah it's still pretty though I love
this hair though I love this color this
color is great for my complexion which I
love and it curls as you can see it
curls easy and you can see the tones of
the different colors in it but they're
very close so yeah um oh Lord again the
closure is from closure stores and
subways closure and then the hair is
from Princess hair shop
I don't recall because this is a while
ago what here this is but I'll post
everything below oh well on the hair you
know what kinda here it is um I wanted
to say something else too but not infer
god I use this eyes curling iron just to
curl it and me that I was in it and I've
been wearing this for like a couple days
now you know just to kind of get or wear
and tear back into it cuz I missed it
and I haven't did it in a while and then
you guys know I had my big blue curly
hair so I was like I had to dig this up
because I did not know where it was but
I'm happy that I found it and um yeah I
hope you guys enjoyed this and it's just
a little update I'm blue overt um yeah
