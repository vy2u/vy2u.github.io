I feel like Lea I'm coming very
one-in-a-million vibes just that's how
I'm feeling right now
else I'm feeling so to my hell guys and
before I start I want you guys to get a
close-up because my hair is not black
was black but it ain't just black is
actually blue and black blue black so
you guys can see me break it up you see
here my hair actually has some color in
it so I used a blue color so the hair
that I'm currently rocking is from and
says hair sharp and you guys know I work
with Princess hair shop uh quite a few
times in the past and just recently I
have just thought about like whoever I
work with in a minute
and of course it was Princess hair shop
um for no particular reason I had not
worked with them I just hadn't I
actually wore my blue hair up again
recently first something else and I was
thinking about like I mean I don't hear
from them in a minute so from my
understanding they have regrouped it's
like a lot of different stuff going on
over there so I'll give you guys which
is good thing for y'all we're gonna talk
about that so let's just get into my
specs of my bundles I am rocking there
your region straight and I'm rocking it
in this is a 1b and of course I bleached
it up into about a 4 and then I put
color over it so I put a clip here of um
how it looked after I bleached it and it
took it's still very soft and nice I
used the adore color in royal navy and I
put it on there and I let it sit for
about 2 or 3 days because I wanted to
make sure that all everything that was
blonde or have been bleached does take
to the color because I don't want to
have brown hair and then blonde hair and
then blue hair that's not what I wanted
so I'm currently rocking to 20s a 16 I'm
rocking a also a subways closure from
them as a wet hell so I believe I have
it in two 20s
a 18 and a 16 and I believe that my
surveys closure is also either 16 or 18
I can't remember which one it is
so lady I've been feeling real godly in
good night so I decided to just
accompany myself and all that is good or
white and I recently with my sister we
went to Sephora and I seen this lip
color which I was totally obsessed with
and I'll put the link to it in the name
of analogous them below
so to my hair so you guys know that I
have one in blue black hair for a while
and then sometimes the issue with that
is which I end up achieving but right
when I achieved it I just was kind of
over the look so I just kind of let it
go I actually gave the hair to someone
else you guys not staying here away and
I was like okay I'm gonna go ahead and
try my luck with this again so this time
I actually went ahead and bleached it so
I used VW bleach um and I used it in 40
volume I bleached the bottoms of this
hair to about here and then from here
down everything I use for our four
bundles so I used four four bundles in
the closure so I use four bottles of our
doors really Navy so that it can give me
this subtle but get blue color so you
can see it's blue here but it's still a
little brown here and I wanted it to mix
so this would be more of a subtle blue
as opposed to a very the other blue that
I had before this that blue is
completely like you got to work in
somewhere where they let you be yourself
like a hot topics or something but this
is subtle but you can see it especially
in the Sun you can really tell how
bright my hair is without it
overpowering
myself now I purposely wore this outfit
only because I wanted you guys to see
that even if I'm standing here there's
color in my hair but there's not crazy
amounts of color where it's just over
doing it so I have on it's like I have
on this color and this color and then
I'm trying to mute it off with the white
but I can't is everything kind of works
together so it's subtle but yet is there
it when I bleached all my bundles I left
the little zip tie that comes at the
top I left that on and I just did each
bundle I didn't unroll them I actually
just did and spread them out and I
bleached both sides and I left the
bleach on for approximately about 30
minutes um give or take depending some
bundles were lighter than others and I
did that on purpose because I didn't
want it to all be one color I wanted
like the darker the color the blonde the
darker my color is going to be and then
it's going to be lighter the lighter the
color is gonna be I mean it's just
common sense right so I did that and
then I also did my closure as well and
it came out beautiful like this is
exactly what I wanted and I remember
when I had colored my other princess
hair shop hair it did the same thing
they have a great thing about quality
when it comes to hair because it did not
get crunchy it did not I mean I feel
like I left it on a little bit longer
and it would've still been okay but I
didn't want to mess up my hair cuz you
know then it's like how do you explain
to the company oh I'm sorry I'm kinda
over bleached it is crunchy you know so
it's see it's still soft I can still run
my fingers through this and I get no
issues no snags no grabs no crunchiness
my ends curl beautifully this hair curls
very nicely doing this originally again
it's straight hair and I did my favorite
style that I love the behind the ear
one-in-a-million get down and I did this
one up closure which I never really do
what sounds like this usually I'll do
this either with a lace wig or full lace
wig I'll do with the frontal but I tried
it it is a little thick up in here for
behind the ear I'm kind of looking a
little bit like an elf but if it was
kind of like this I think I would be
cool but for overall I feel like you get
the concept so there's a few things I'm
going to tell you guys about that have
changed since the last time I have
reviewed for princess hair shop so one
of the first things is they make custom
wigs now so if you guys are not very
well-versed in making your own wigs and
something new to you and you want to buy
some here and you really want this hair
to be in a way you can actually contact
them and have that custom done for you
so that you wouldn't have to do it
yourself or um get the hair and then
find somebody to make the way
anything with vaccine query and usually
when our companies offer wig making
services I always tell people who are
not well-versed in doing that to paid a
little extra go to get what you want
because the great thing about that is
that it comes already ready to where you
don't have to worry about how and who
then put it in they also have pre-made
wigs for sale too so I believe if I'm
not mistaken and please princess Aaron
Schock correct me if I'm wrong but I
believe the premium leaves are also made
with their hair as well so if you have
let's just say you want some Russian red
and you want that made into a you want
like four bundles of 20 inch and you
want bangs you can already get that if
they have an available or you can get a
custom made if they do not they also are
offering 30% off their premium line you
use cold
happy 30 and you can only save on their
princess hair shower royal remy line if
you use Colby John you get $10 off so
that's the only discounts they got going
on right now I would take full advantage
of everything I just told y'all I would
take advantage of it um because again
princess hair shop is one of my favorite
companies they are great with quality
they are great with understanding what's
hot what's not I've seen a lot of people
use their hair for a lot of like
celebrities and stuff like that which is
great um but it also shows that their
hair is a lot of flexibility this hair
holds a beautiful girl and a lot of even
if I wasn't originally originally I was
going to want pro this hair and I did
not do it because I became in front of
my wand so I didn't do that but that's
what I was going to do because I knew
that it was going to end up holding for
a style that I want to be I want to do
like how to Beyonce's was at the Super
Bowl which I believe it was which like
the middle part with the waves but long
but I wanted to do it like shorter hair
I think she might have had about 24 26 I
have 20 but again 20 inches always good
for something very very very subtle but
you and a lot of you guys like the more
subtle look is the first you know the
ba-ba-boom crazy so I wanted to gotta
give you guys this
so look but I wanted to give y'all some
couple of - so yes I use that good all
adore which always work I never use any
other color because it just never works
the same like that something about the
way to here the color is formulated just
works so and you guys are interested in
this hair again I have in four bundles
and a sub base closure um this is your
reason I believe like I don't remember
what origin of my closure is and I want
to say that it might be rushing but it
also may be Eurasian - I'm not sure but
I know my bundles for sure are two
bundles of 2018 and a 16 so and I went
ahead and just cut it and I bleached it
with my b/w bleach and I used 40 volume
developer for that and I lifted it to a
certain point so that it I could put the
color on it and I will make sure that
the blue actually showed so if you guys
are interested again click the links
below and I will catch other than my
next one and if you have any questions
