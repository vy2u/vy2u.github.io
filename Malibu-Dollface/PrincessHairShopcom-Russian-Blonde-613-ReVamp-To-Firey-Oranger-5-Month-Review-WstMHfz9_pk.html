I knew it it feels like I've been gone
for like two years it's only been two
weeks
wait whoa like we can have so I'll Derek
I thought Ariel like a hood area
speaking of which do you guys ever brush
I thought this was so cute I thought
this a hot topic and I was like I'm
doing my aura care which everybody keeps
saying when you go do your red hair my
hair people is orange it's not red ah at
all it's literally orange and pink so oh
right yes girl I was looking on citizen
skin away Benson did not go but I'm
happy to be here with Jon so this is my
good old princess hair shop hair that I
did for my what was obviously this intro
but I did it for my New Year's when I
tried to use a new camera and all that I
really wanted to do something in that
intro you guys seen that my hair was
straight so I wanted to give you guys a
chance to see it when while it was
curled and because you can see a wise
crow you can see that it is orange and
pink as opposed to it being red like
people thought it was so it's been quite
some time since I've actually did this
color so I don't remember exactly what
these colors are but Princess hair shop
got my good old egg so this was
originally their Russian platinum color
which was a 613 color it was a the
bundles were
6:13 with dark roots and in my frontal
also in 6:13 with dark roots as well so
I was like I hit her up and I said I
want to do this picture of little Kim
which I'll y'all know Kim comes from for
a big goal for a minute
so it was this picture which was the
promo shot for the 2000 MTV Awards and
she I did it fire truck with these half
naked dudes and I just saw her here I
remember scene at the time and was like
her hair color is everything but at a
time my hair knowledge was not nearly as
close to what it is now so I was fishing
through because she inspired me like no
other her and alia are like my two main
inspirations when it comes down to just
being creative so I went ahead and went
to my favorite company every when it
comes to color which is a door a door
has the widest ranges of color but they
also have and really good like the color
payoff is just ridiculous like and then
the one trick that I love to do with the
door that always works for me
is that when the color is sitting and
you literally let it sit I like to let
mine sit overnight sometimes a couple of
days depending on what I'm doing in
between when the color is done it kind
of turns clear and once it's clear it
kind of lets you know that once you
rinse it the color will not rub off
where is it like jazzing and even like
some Paul Mitchell brands it just
depends if you don't leave it on long
enough it's not going to stay in here in
order to remain and have a color that's
gonna last I did this color back in
December and I watched his hair because
I wore it like crazy I don't know how
many times and I've yet to update or do
a wash or has to replenish the color in
any way shape or form and stayed like
this so adore has 50% to do with it and
frontier shock has the others to do with
it because I had some 613 here that I
was going to die another color which
again I still haven't done yet well I
tended to do and then the color and what
the
didn't work out so yeah it's close to
this stuff so I'm saying and um it
didn't it didn't say right look it was
blotchy it was and I know it wasn't me
because I just did some other hair that
you guys seen which was around the time
I did my smoke bob color it was fine so
I was like I don't understand why this
hair isn't bleaching but anyway I mean
why this hair isn't taking but anyway
this hair has literally held up and I
love their hair personally for me just
because of the fact that it's easier to
get what I want
they're the Russian hair is full as you
can see someone bring this eye forward
it's very full and I don't think
forwards like oh my god is just too much
hair is full enough where it looks very
very much voluminous it looks like how
it's supposed to look
it has a nice luster into it it holds a
curl you know it is all of those
components that make up how your do is
going to look I wore it strength first
because I was going crazy I just got
that damn sand and I wanted to make sure
that y'all seen all the color and I
wanted to kind of represent fire you
know I'm stance so um that was my whole
thing and then I was okay so now they've
already seen it straight let me go ahead
and do it with some ways and some curls
in it so this is the south of course is
my favorite self ever a whole buncha
layers a hard thing and a lot hairspray
and it worked out so this is my hair
after these curls have set for about I
want to say like two days
yeah those two days and we here with it
and as you this is the thing this is the
one thing that I love in always tends
your hair out after you let your hair
sit for a couple of days if you have
time to do so and you take a brush and
you go through it and you brush it if it
bounces just like that you're good
you're good now again a couple of hours
of some pin curls will give you the same
effect but I
it has to recrawl my hair at all and
that's the trick I can throw my wig back
on and then leave out the door and be so
good now the colors that I used was
orange blaze way I think it was the
other thing it was orange blaze hold on
okay because I cannot remember cuz it's
been that long so I am wearing three
colors sunset orange blaze orange and
hot pink so I just remember doing this
Bob ed um didn't know this will be one
of the most popular looks I really did
and I think we was gonna like it let's
go very Halloween ish although this is a
very good Halloween wig okay boy um I
use three colors because I don't like my
hair to be one-dimensional I just thinks
it looks it starts to look at Oh at that
point where you just you know all the
huh girls they get five bottles of one
color I don't want to do that so I'll
always like to use if I do like let's
just let me do pink I'm going to do a
variance of pink it give you like a soft
magenta and then like a very dark
magenta it just depends so in the
original intro you can see at the ends
because it was straight and even in the
photos I hope that you can see the
variance and this you can see it but
it's very it all kind of runs together
as one color although there is
definitely more than one color going on
to the eye it just looks because it's so
uniform as far as my curls are concerned
then yeah but adore has some of the best
like I said some of the best freakin
color ever and when you want to do
something a little bit more and more
ambitious side or you want to make sure
the color sticks I would always go with
a door you can never go wrong I know
some places is ridiculously priced and
in other places it is moderately priced
so it just really depends on you but for
me I'm paying like literally like five
dollars a bottle I think I used I think
I used like five or six bottles without
have some hot pink wet I only use I
think one bottle I brought like three
for whatever reason I want to use one
bottle because my pink is only
concentrated here at the tip
so my closure is from closure stored and
that's why I get a lot of my from you
guys know I love you to fold your store
like crazy because they have some of the
best front tools and closures and it's
when I was going close you're crazy
that's God love me a bit so baby but
this is actually not so baby this is a
link for I like lace frontals more than
I like steel base closures I don't even
like closures member I'm talking with
you on but I definitely I can't do this
with a closure I can but you know I
can't believe it you have to you have to
wear weaves can't what it understand
every just right but um so my front my
limbs go I am wearing to 28 to 26 is and
to 24 and then I'm also wearing a 20
inch lace frontal now I went ahead and
layered this hair like I said in the
beginning of this video
originally this hair was straight and
before I when I did it straight I had
not cutting them these layers into it so
the layers came after the fact
I can't straight my hair and still wear
it the same but the way I chopped is
there a girl is this is how I plan to
wear it I just wanted to get to be able
to show which I'll show what it looks
like with the straight if you didn't see
them forming the intro or whatever that
time I looked it was very beautiful and
moved effortlessly I didn't have I have
more issues with my jacket in the intro
than I have a layer okay it's completely
different
I don't I never have issues with
princess hair shop here and that's the
thing that I love about this company is
that it's easier for me to go ahead and
get some six thirteen fourteen I'm here
from them and call it a day and they're
the only company that I know that's the
right now that actually still sells
sells six thirteen hair with black roots
on the actual West a lot of times when I
need six thirteen here and I'm wearing
it and they send me a frontal to have
dark roots though the bundles don't so
in other words if you put all your like
a bad part in my head right here you can
still see that my roots on this way are
so dark if I did that with any other
hair I've had what happens is if the
wind blow this is black and that's still
whatever color it is blonde red orange
whatever
so that's what I did left who she gave
me the option like do you want it with
roots or without roots and I don't get
those options very often because again
everybody is kind of doing the extreme
look right now which I've done where I
don't have any roots it's the color and
I plan on having one coming soon so
that's fine but there are still people
out who still want color but don't want
to have to necessarily commit to being
sold rava is even you know so I
definitely feel like Arial in this look
I definitely even though it's not red
it's orange it definitely has a little
mermaid feel to it because of the ways
and the op the blue background you know
and I got the skin show so I'm happy to
be back with you guys I'm happy to be
able to do this so they printed hair
shop and closure store they get a 10 out
of 10 I haven't had any major shading
issues with this hair thank God because
they doesn't work so walking around
seeing a whole bunch of orange hair on
the floor with ping tips parts tangling
goals let's see okay okay come on
through now oh now that was not 20 okay
so out this is what hearings guys it
just it is usually this one of the
problem i'ma resign eeks here with this
color years ago and I was there just
still dinner and look at me now right
and everything which angle do so I hope
you guys enjoyed this one um this is a
great summer color I think I'm gonna
wear this to pride I got a lot of skin
to show for pride and I need my hair to
be just as amazing so I think I'm like
this might be my pride here and yeah if
