be the update on my good old good guy
doll from child's play - um I know it's
been a long time but because last time I
came you guys I had a kid um some fabric
and I think that was it so I've got a
lot of progress since our last little
meeting so I'm gonna start off with the
bow girls that are not done because I
need to find a centrist that can cut
this fabric for me so first thing is
gonna be the good guy material that I
have which is um horace blue corduroy
just like the movie so I don't know if I
showed this in my last one but if I
didn't there you go so um this has all
of the Chucky pattern on it and then the
person who does it whatever I do
actually get to UM so leaves I want them
to keep this little tag on this pants on
the side of its hand so I want them to
cook from here so yeah this was
originally a bag and you guys know I
ripped the back apart
it originally looked like this one I
have three of these so this is from the
medic on a good guy toys it was just a
tote bag though this is what the other
bag looks like this is what this looked
like before our sort of um and this is
the exact print and exact size in the
exact corduroy from the actual movie um
I just have to find someone to actually
make the overall for me because I am NOT
well-versed in someone I can so weave in
but I cannot um I'm not very good with
patterns or whatever I have really tried
but I don't want to mess this up cause
he cut on one deal so I could try it
with a pattern and see I'll try it and
see but I want this kind of done before
Halloween so if anybody's in LA who
knows how to sew and you want to make
some money from and whatever you got a
job okay um so yeah I got three of these
so it should be more than enough for the
entire overall I can probably get two
pairs out of
to be on the job so that's those I have
an extra arm um because this one I had
when I received it from the seller and
I'll put the eBay seller that I got my
entire body from down below so Vinny are
looking to buy one by all means
knock yourself out this is one of his
hands this would be his left hand yeah
this will be he's writing in sorry um
but when I received it it just had too
much of a second skin on it right here
so a pen I could have I mean I could
sand all this down but I knew for a fact
that it could have been done better so I
contacted the seller and he shook me out
a new pan so yeah um I'll use this one
for whatever I need for if I need to
chop something often I've extra hand to
do so and it has the nudge that goes in
to the actual body um and just so you
guys know this body that I have is the
one that is they were like 85,000 bodies
in this movie um if you look at the
stock photos in the art department room
armed with the puppeteers there are so
many different of Chucky dolls that did
so many different things this was a dog
that I have that I made my good guy out
of was the doll that you watch child's
play to I don't know exactly what the
timestamp would be but it's in the
factory and then there's like a it
looked like you know like those slides
you see at the park for kids and it's
kind of spiral but they're dolls that
are going down there and they go down to
be on the conveyor belt to look at the
eyes put in this with these this is what
this doll was molded from because it
does move it does is not stiff like the
ones that were standing up those I'm
almost certain like this part that goes
into the body either was done tighter or
they glued them together so it wouldn't
need this one actually moves I also want
to say that I have two extra heads for
the doll as well you guys know that I
told you guys I had a very hard time
trying to find
um actual good guy replica head it was
very difficult
so last update I showed you guys this
edge was this one and as you guys see I
never quite finished digging through the
eyes this head is from the cellar that I
have my current body from um you guys
will see that the color has changed a
lot as well
and he moated it the back of this is
hollow but the front is like solid so it
was no way for you to put eyes in this
head if you wanted to look screen
accurate without actually ruining of the
head or slicing it and it was a lot so I
guess he maybe I don't know if he had
complained or really thought about the
things that he decided to do another
head and a more of a fleshy color and
make it more Hollow which brought me to
this head which was this one so this one
looks way more spring accurate as far as
colors concerned i'm compared to this
head so yeah this was a big difference
on the also the other big difference was
is hollow
this is hollow this is not is very very
heavy
this one is squishy so the very thing
about that is that you can pretty much
do this if you want to I mean if I was
going to do until I end up with my other
head for my final one um you could just
run a actually a seen through here and
pull it back and then put the eyes like
cut this out because these go into this
is what I was trying to I was wishing
that the other one was like that too um
but this one came from the full doll so
I just you can cut these out and then
get some eyes that actually match and
then go ahead and paint so once I had
the entire doll I ran into another
person who actually was selling um a
blank a light blanket so you guys
probably can't tell on camera that will
be yeah this is what it was pretty much
cast from so I have three heads that I
really don't have much use for but I
would find a use especially this one um
if I ever want to just have a
number one I can because again they all
have the little things at the bottom
that go into the body just like the
movie so I can use these regardless okay
so once I ended up getting jacks
although can help you do shoes same
color I ended up with second guy shoes
um I have to buy another pair because
you guys notice right here accidentally
when I was putting the shoe strings
through which I did not buy from the
seller I got these from somewhere else
um a pool do in it rip because this is
made out of rubber so you know uh so
yeah unfortunately that's where I met
with the shoes um as well as the fact
that the doll that I currently have the
shoes do not fit and like I said earlier
the movie has so many different dolls
and there's so many different things
that the actual naked dolls I don't
believe I can fit the shoes because I
try to put it in and this is poking out
so what I'm gonna have to do is buy
another set of legs and slice the UM I
made that row dramatic but slice the
actual told off and kind of the side of
the toe so that I can actually put the
shoes on the doll because um they do not
fit and this is the other shoe that I
have not got around to finishing yet
when I received um both of the shoes
they were just red as you can see I got
some cleaning up to do at the bottom of
both of these but um
they do have the original good guy stuff
at the bottom and everything is screen
accurate I just used I went to Michael's
and got me some regular white paint and
a couple of brushes and I just went
ahead and painted these to the correct
color and I use my seed of Chucky a
replica doll as a template to see where
the white goes and what stays red um the
shoe strings actually got from a
different seller they're also screen
accurate because the ones on my seat of
Chucky doll does the actual font of this
is too small it's like really small but
if you look at the movie especially
cosplay - they were this big so once I
had these I was like okay so this is the
doll finished for the most part um the
problem
I'm having now is the fact that his feet
of the shoes again like I told you do
not fit his feet and the hair whoever
cut this wig did a atrocious job because
it looks terrible however the face is
super-duper-duper accurate and there's
nothing better that you can do and what
someone did which was really smart which
I didn't think about but now I'm gonna
tell you how to um to get because every
time I see one of these dolls painted
the eyebrows and the eyelashes and the
freckles always are off it's something
always wrong this doll looks like it's
straight out the movie as opposed don't
mind the clothes because that's what you
guys I haven't got them um cut yet so
he's wearing of these extra seat of
Chucky clothes for right now just so
they can have a full outfit um but I
will show you guys you should have been
a picture I'll put it right here of what
the doll looks like with no clothes on
just naked and as you can see um all all
of this stuff all his legs and stuff
they actually move my question is why in
the hell did Andy have such a big dog
for a little charm um speaking of Andy
you guys are probably asking me where I
got these from I got this from beloved
shirts calm they actually have like the
onesy like how Andy has except they
don't have a zipper in the back is in
front
um but since it's Halloween season I had
to get this because this was just
SuperDuper dope and I said I was waiting
for also to do this review or this
update as well go back to the situation
in him
um but yeah as you can see everything
does move because there's a big gap
between his head and his body and that's
why I said I think each dog served a
different purpose
so what I'm gonna do is my friend told
me there is like a gear you can get and
you can get it in any size and I can put
it around his neck so that it'll sit
like this and then he can I can move his
head any way without it doing all of
this because I just wanted to do this um
but I am not finished I have to give him
a new wig because this wig is definitely
terrible um and I don't like the way
that they did it and it like glued it
down
so I'm looking for a weakness color but
back to my point on what they did was
they took the screen I think what they
did was a tip the screenshots from the
actual movie which isn't child's play to
the beginning when they are rebuilding
Chuckie from child's play one you see
them put the freckles on in the
eyelashes and eyebrows on him but when
somebody pretends it it always looks
wrong what they did was I think don't
pull
they actually got some decals made they
took the screenshot blew it up and then
have them on some clear have them
printed on some clear paper and then
stuck them on the doll so you probably
can tell right here where they cut it
out you can kind of see where the decals
are especially on the freckles but it's
the most accurate that you're gonna get
unless somebody is just really good with
your precision but um it doesn't bother
me at all and if I ever wanted to film
something I have the entire body plus
the regular head that I could use um as
well so he's pretty much he's like 95%
done we just have to go ahead and get
some more shoes um and then we just have
to UM and we gotta get an extra pair of
lips because I do want out before I cut
these follow them down I do want a new
pair just in case I need to use the doll
for some things um but what I'm gonna do
to have the extra arm probably get an
extra arm and then do a plush version of
him where he's not like hard because in
the back it does have this face where
you can put the battery pack if I wanted
to and this is the undercarriage of his
head but if I wanted to actually put a
battery pack back here I could um still
thinking about it I might actually go
ahead altogether and get a brand new
body just for the second one I'm not
really sure yet but my dream kind of has
come true that I got my own good guy
doll because this is my point
so once the clothes are finished and I
get his another sweater for him um I'm
definitely going to come to you guys and
show you guys the final product when
it's done as well as the new wig so I
hope this kind of answered
all of your questions about what's been
going on with my Chuckie dog because I
know it's been awhile but you guys see
it's been a lot of progress since the
last update that I gave you guys
hopefully I can come you guys on
Halloween if not early before Alamein
and everything will be finished she's
gotta find a seamstress really um and
I'm looking for an actual replica
sweater as we speak so you guys know any
information or you guys want to know
anything let me know
and I just wanna get a close up on his
face again because I did a great job the
eyes are perfect like everything so it's
a little creepy but it's Chucky why not
so I will catch you guys in the next one
and if you have any questions please put
them below</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
