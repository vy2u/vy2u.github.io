installment of project Chucky so I'm a
lot of you guys when you guys watch my
videos you always comment about this
Chucky doll which is my seat of Chucky
Chucky from Sideshow Collectibles if you
guys notice here this is the child's
play to poster which is my first um that
was the first checking movie that I ever
saw I didn't see jaws play one until
after I've seen two so ever since then
I've had an obsession with Chucky
so um throughout the years I have
purchased plenty of dolls but none of
them have been very accurate when it
comes that when it came down to the good
guy dolls so you guys know this
particular Chucky doll that is usually
sitting back there in my videos I took
him down for this reason he is the most
accurate Chucky that you're ever gonna
get as of now um he was done by Sideshow
Collectibles back in 2009 he sold
originally for 400 no 549 I think and
then once people I think it was eight
hundred and something that was made of
him and then I think I got number 11 and
then now these dolls are going for like
$3,000 on ebay and $4,000 on Amazon like
it's ridiculous um but this is the most
accurate the UM the sweater the overalls
are very accurate to the movie the shoes
are very accurate to the movie
everything from his eyes everything is
very very very accurate to what the
movie is so I was very pleased with this
doll but I still felt a little cheated
because every time there has been a
version of the good guy doll it has
never looked like Chucky it always looks
like a knockoff version so this doll
people always asked when they see them
in my background on my Instagram videos
they be like oh when people ask in the
comments like where did you get the doll
from a lot of people will give them a
link or tell them to go to Spencer's
this is a Spencer's doll okay oh this
doll who looks nothing like this one
you can see there is a big difference
okay this would be an iPhone this would
be an Android sorry Android but I'm just
saying okay the overalls are not
accurate accurate they're the wrong
color the shoes are all wrong he's stiff
as hell he looks nothing like Chucky so
this is not what you want to do unless
you just want to chuck it all this I had
that one when I first came out and I
just has been he needs to get thrown
away because I just but I wanted to keep
it for this particular purpose so for
the for about a couple of years I have
been on the internet searching to find
things props from the movie and things
that come up and it'll just be so
expensive and I've been looking for a
lot of stuff from child's play to I
don't really care too much about child's
play one or child's play three but
child's play two is what I wanted to go
for wholeheartedly so I had did a lot of
research and I was trying to find things
and things were popping up and things
weren't so a couple of years ago um
there was a mask what was it was a head
replica of the first child's play movie
the first good guy doll and for a lot of
people who don't know throughout the
years through the Chucky movies the
dolls change depending on who the design
team is because some materials were
better than versus what they were then
you know so they changed things up which
causes the doll to live a little bit
different so Chucky has a lot of issues
with um on a staying the same he changes
throughout every movie like child's play
one his face was a little bit bigger and
he looked a little bit very dull like
but the second one he had more like a
soul to him so he looks a little bit
better for the neck and I of the person
who hasn't watched these movies
you probably think they all look the
same but they look very different but
child's play too in my opinion because
of the whole Factory and everything it
felt like the most authentic child's
play movie to me to this day so I'm like
I think I'm just going to go ahead and
build my own I seen a lot of people
build their own and they've done amazing
jobs but I just don't feel like it was
done as the because the materials were
not afforded to them type of situation
okay so
I'm going to create my own good guy doll
and I have I'm going to the process
right now so this will be the first
update now probably end up doing about
five or six of these so the first thing
I'm going to show you guys is this head
and this head
I'm not finished carving out his eyes so
this head is an exact replica of the
child's play to Chucky head um this is
what it looks like all the way around
have no clue what this is on the side of
his face but whatever it is I will
probably end up buffing it out anyway
but this was pretty much cashed it looks
a little orange er no it looks about the
same um as the one from the movie so if
you watch child's play - in the very
beginning there is a pretty much a
skeleton in its head a lot of times the
dolls that were made like this from like
Chinese companies the clothes will be
accurate the shoes will be okay but the
head scope would be so off it would not
look anything like Chucky
it would look like a version of Chucky
so this is actually molded from an exact
child's play to replica head from the
movie so that this is about it this is
good as you're gonna get it's made out
of actual rubber so it's actually heavy
so it sounds like remember like a um
like a ball you will play with at school
that's what it sounds like um I didn't
know when I purchased his head from the
seller that it was gonna be like closed
off back here so I have to put a slit to
the back of his head and I have to drill
through his eye sockets because I did
buy eyes for him to use I don't want him
to have I don't want to draw his eyes
and I want to actually have like acrylic
eyes so that's gonna work however I
found someone else on eBay who has his
head but it's a white blink and it's
very smooth and it's not nearly as much
as I paid for this head it's what's
ridiculous however I think I'm going to
use that one because I can hollow that
head out versus this one I'll keep this
one because you never know when I might
need it again but I think I'm going to
use that one and that one is probably a
little bit um lighter as well but
recently I got Chucky shoes and these
are exact replicas from the movie
this is what they look this is the
bottom of the good guy desert aside this
would all be white and these stripes
also would be white as well as his good
guy shoestrings
and I have two sets of these shoe
strings just in case something happens
you know um so I'm going to put these in
after I spray paint these I actually
have some spray paint that I and I have
to also trim the extra niche off of
these shoots as well but these shoes are
actually screen-used
replica shoes because even my even this
dog his shoes are nice but there are
certain things about the shoes that are
missing so they look the same very much
so they look the same but there are some
inconsistencies just like look at the
front of his um of his shoes look how
little the fun is of the good guy vs.
and the movie version look how big it is
so it's a difference and these are
little things that I look at you know
because I'm just anal about it
so um I have to paint these and I have
the trim knees and then the other thing
is his overalls which seems to be such
an issue even when I see people make
their own they never look like the movie
version these overalls that he has on
our blood-stained so and it have rips
and tears in them from what happened in
the Bride of Chucky so get what this
happened in child's play three and then
he was sewn back together so this is
pretty much with thee these are not
usable if I'm trying to make a good guy
door it's like why would he have those
on you know I'm saying so I have my own
as you can see fabric and this actually
was taken because a company called
Medicom which is a Chinese I think it's
a Chinese based company um they actually
made these good guy bags with wallets so
instead of trying to find the right kind
of corduroy and then try to find all
these decals clean them up then screen
print them I just simply brought two of
those and then I pulled all the seams
out of them so that I came pretty much
so a pair of overalls with both of these
that will be screen accurate to the
actual good guy doll so I just have the
10 things because if you notice that the
color of these and these are very
similar but these are just a tad bit
darker so the yellow that is on these
does is it shouldn't be well on camera
is looking quite right so we'll see but
I know for a fact that these should be a
little too bit darker but after I sold
them in depends on how they look I like
them then I might keep them like that I
don't know yeah um and then the rest of
Chuckies body which would be his arms
his torso and his legs are on the way so
I will be back in a couple of weeks with
an update about how far I've gotten with
this but I did feel the need to show and
share for those who want to do the very
same with their good guy dolls are you a
Chucky's fan and you want to try your
hand at it why not um the head was off
of ebay as well as the shoes were off
the eBay and the shoe strings were off
of ebay so if I was you I would look up
Chucky props
Chucky replicas keep that in your follow
because you can follow on eBay now and
just keep that in there so if you're
looking for something every time
somebody post something with that
particular name you can automatically go
to it and see what it is if you need it
or not so um yeah I'm also have to find
the correct colour for if I do use this
head I'm going to use a flesh colour of
spray paint to go over this head um and
because it's way too yellow like it's
like very orange yellowish and as you
can see this is not the colour of Chucky
that's not even close but they do have
these um like pink the pink skin tone
spray paints that work good on rubber
and also I have another spray paint
that's white that I used on one of my
Barbie
it was Ken's Mini Cooper and I spray
painted it white and it's the spray
paint that I use was made for plastic
and rubbers so it'll heat and not fade
or dissipate or mess up their materials
it'll last a lifetime so I'm going to
use that for his shoes so once I do that
I will come back and give you an update
on what's going on but I wanted to share
this with you guys because I thought
this would be a
for me to be able to look from the start
to the finish but I've gotten pretty far
um so far about what I want to do so
Chucky is on hits away and I will catch
you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
