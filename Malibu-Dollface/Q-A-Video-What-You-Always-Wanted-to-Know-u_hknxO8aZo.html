there's gonna be a lot of questions that
I get on a regular basis that I don't
get the answer because but you guys
don't have Instagram and I have Twitter
and I have all this stuff but there's so
many people now like I can't reply back
to everybody like I would never put my
phone down so this is kind of like a
general situation just to kind of get
you get your question answered if it was
asked this is like the most frequently
asked questions that I usually get so
number one how long did your real hair
and why don't you show it well my real
hair now is probably I'm gonna say about
right here yeah I think when I took my
on my braids our last time ago right
here the reason why I don't wear my hair
out anymore it's because I'm like a
we've added the wig like I don't wear my
hair out you guys know I wore braids for
five years and after wearing them for so
long and wear my natural hair
I'm over it like all of that main is to
keep it up to keep it healthy to keep it
right like I'm over all of that so if I
can find alternative to make it a little
bit easier on me then so be it
so that's the only reason I'm not like
ball-headed or something y'all know damn
well I bought it no quick cut the shirt
um but yeah that's the only reason know
cuz it just makes it a little bit more
easy for me but I do like I'm not one of
those people although I am my hair guru
and all that good stuff I guess you
could say now that's what I am because
that's pretty much what I do most of the
time versus what I used to do but it's
about growth that's all you know it's
about like this hair smell growth like
you're really good a month ago
okay um where do you live I don't know
why there's a discrepancy cuz I've said
this so many times in videos I'm like
here in LA you know being in California
it's always sunny in my videos where
it's you know where else do you think I
live but I am born in way I am born and
raised from sunny California
um I've lived nowhere else I've been
here all my life I live in LA okay like
LA and I've been here since I was born
so yeah I am a Californian why are you
always sitting on the full
or people always ask me this this is my
spot no the reason why I sit on the
floor is because um in my bedroom
there is horrible lighting and if I'm
doing reviews and you can't see the
product that's a problem we have a very
huge bay window in here like it takes up
most of the wall so that's why I get
this natural light when I do videos so
the issue is there's a sofa right there
and there's the coffee table here so the
only place that I can see is here which
happens to be about the door on the
floor so that's the only reason why I
sit here and it's become comfortable up
I'm used to it it is what it is I am
gonna try to say change my scenery a
little bit this year cuz I'm gonna start
using a different camera so that would
this really wouldn't matter but I do
like it here and it does I like the
natural light I'm not really one for
lights cuz it gets hot and I wear makeup
and I wear wigs and it's hot and it I
wanna feel like I'm cooking so that's
the only reason why I actually sit on
the floor but there's no particular
reason other than that why don't you
ever show your family only your friends
well the thing about it is my friends
that you've seen in my videos that way
my friends then you see but the reason
why I never show my family or any of my
other friends is because they didn't
choose to be on YouTube they didn't
choose this and something some people
are not comfortable with sharing their
lives with people that they don't know I
happen to be one of them I don't really
care um my friends that you guys do see
they don't care but my mom and my sister
and my granny my grandfather like all
those people they don't want to be part
of this you know and I respect that
because my mom doesn't want to be in a
store and somebody's trying to talk to
her because they watched one of my
videos and she's trying to buy cereal
that's not really you know something
that she she no longer ghetto so that
really wouldn't work either so I don't
be like oh you know doggies mom some
bitch so I just kind of keep them to
themselves they don't care about none it
it's like all this stuff that I'm doing
at YouTube they don't care about it so
whatever so that's why I kind of keep it
just to myself in my select amount of
friends that I choose to have in my
videos that actually want to be in my
videos that's the only thing how do you
stay comfortable
in your skin um I think it came with
time I remember when I first got on
YouTube it was just such a hard thing
for me to grasp because of the simple
fact that I'm a very outgoing person and
I'm a very different type of person but
everybody doesn't get that so when I
would get hate comments and hate mailing
and stuff like that from people it
really would like get like get to me
because I'm like I don't even do
anything to nobody but when life you
don't have to do nothing and nobody for
them to really dislike you it's just
that's just how they feel um but I've
learned that any of this stuff this
YouTube any of the other stuff that I do
it doesn't define who I am and I am Who
I am rather the cameras on or off so it
has to be that every day of my life you
know I'm saying so you learn to be
comfortable with the person that you are
on camera off camera and who you just
are in general because in life if you
continue to be something that you're not
it's gonna start to show and it's gonna
start to peek out and then you're gonna
do all of this homework and all of this
backpedaling and try to save who you are
so I just pretty much go with the flow
whatever comes out whatever stay however
I feel whether I want pink hair blue
hair no hair that's just me
so that's all it is how how come your
video content has changed for my last
channel in this channel for him and a
majority of this channel I did a lot of
inspirational videos about everything um
and after a while like anything it kind
of gets boring um maybe not for you guys
but for me as a person who's doing them
sometimes it takes a lot for me to sit
up here and talk about something that I
probably either don't want to talk about
I'm not really interested in that's why
I don't do reviews on shows and stuff
like that because a lot of the stuff I
don't watch anymore because I'm just so
far gone and so I just don't care
anymore
so I try to switch it up to kind of give
other people who do watch you do you
know I'm trying to give you guys all of
something like today I just did like two
inspirational videos well 2 subject
videos I guess you could say because
they're not always inspirational but
they always real um you know but I can't
always do that because I as a person
have to be happy to and I don't it's
like singing the same song I'm like you
know SWV you got to keep singing week
and they over that she because it was
like
over 20 years ago you get tired of it so
that's the only reason why my subject
matter has changed and kind of shifted
for what it was but I'm still the same
person I'm still gonna talk about those
things it's just always it's not every
video it's gonna be that and I don't
think it should be that you know I grow
as a person as a person I started to get
different interest in different things
that I would like to share with you guys
and it's not always about going off on
somebody or telling somebody something
or being the voice of reason in that
particular moment so that's all will you
ever do a meet and greet this particular
year I want to do I want to do like
three different meet and greets
um the first one here in LA or
California the next one are probably
like Atlanta and then the third one for
sure I want it to be in like New York
um so if you guys are any of any of
those surrounding cities I would like it
I have to plant it out but I think I'm
gonna do it with Sheree love up here on
YouTube I'll leave her a link below but
that's my boo and she's in California
too so I think we should come together
and do some stuff we were talking about
that anyway so me her and maybe anybody
else who's la-based a youtuber that want
to do something will do something but
yeah I see you guys when I'm out and
shopping and stuff but just to have like
a get-together we could talk and laugh
and that's stupid would actually be fun
so definitely this year that is going to
happen who does your hair and do you
take plants I do my own hair and no I do
not take clients I do not work with the
general public anymore if you guys know
I went to a Maranello beauty school and
I had to deal with clients for ten whole
months and I win and I graduated and
when I got out of beauty school I
realized that's not what I wanted to do
that's not something that excites me I
mean I can do my own hair all day and
it's cool but when I how'd you start to
have to deal with people and you guys
know who drew hair we have to do with
all these personalities and all these
people and they want this and they come
in with this much hair but they want
their hair to look like this and you
like yo chick no no you know it's that
type of situation so I'm just I'm just
opted not to do it anymore it's not
something it's very lucrative but it's
just not something that I enjoy to do so
I just choose not to do it cuz I have my
hand and
hi and so many different other things
that I'm really interested in I would
much rather do those and try to make a
quick book to do somebody here while I'm
sitting you're huffing and puffing
because I don't want to do it so yeah I
mean this is a personal choice advice to
any upcoming youtubers I would say to
anybody who's trying to do YouTube be
yourself do not start off the gate
trying to be somebody else I started
YouTube over 5 years ago and it took me
a long time and a climb to be myself but
to get I guess you could say my oh my my
recognition on my dues or where I become
a name where it's known kind of on the
internet you know how you some people
are just known like in a circle but when
you google somebody's name and all my
results come up like that it takes time
and sometimes sometimes I'm trying to
see how much time I got um sometimes
people come on here they be something
else and then when it gets tired of
being that person they're gonna kind of
jump off and do something else and then
people be like I don't understand why
you changed completely you know and
they're like I wasn't that person to
begin with so always be yourself cause
it's gonna make it easier for you to get
an audience because you're being
authentic you guys can see I'm not being
genuine if I'm not being myself if
something is wrong you can always tell
so never come on here and trying to be
something you know there are people on
here acting a damn fool to get views and
it's sad because at the end of the day
they're gonna be known for what acting a
damn fool and you don't want that's not
what you want your legacy to be so it is
what it is how did you get so popular on
YouTube I did this question all the time
I get people hitting me up like can you
shout me out can you do this can you do
that I remember specifically the first
person on YouTube who ever shot at me
out who ever did anything for me was
Queen Cuddy and I mean she does videos
anymore but I remember me her I like
3,000 subscribers together this was my
old channel and I I didn't really know
nobody on YouTube I didn't know she
shouted me out in then it was to Lima 77
and it kind of spiraled into that so it
was kind of a word-of-mouth thing and
then the video is kind of brought other
people along you know it was like it was
you guys that
told your friends who told your family
who told your cousins who told these
people who got me to basically the
status that I am now so it's really a
word-of-mouth thing but you can't you
can't ride off someone else's coattails
in order to get you where you want to go
because if my content wasn't of quality
and my content didn't I wasn't talking
about anything I wouldn't have all you
guys watching me you know so being a
popular is one thing but make sure that
you're popular for a reason and it's a
good reason because people will always
come back people who people who do good
makeup tutorials and hair tutorials and
talk about things that are of quality
people are gonna always subscribe and
always come back when you're just trying
to make a quick buck and you trying to
get on here and do something I remember
when me Sante and other people got on
here there were no Czech there were
none of that stuff yeah we did this
because we like to do it it was fun now
this is a job for people this is a way
for people to make quick money and try
to basically become internet famous so
the the logistics of YouTube have
changed so much versus what they were
when we started
so I still carry those morals and
reasons for me today versus what other
people get on here for it's them it's a
cash cow it's like I'm gonna make money
we're too ads it we're my ass in check
it like it's that type of thing so you
know come on here for a good reason and
the popularity that you garnish from
this will come naturally you can't pay
for it you can't ask people can you shop
me oh because you know I do good videos
and then nobody watching I went through
that same thing sometimes it don't
happen for a minute sometimes people are
gonna start watching you right off the
back sometimes you got to work to get to
where you want to be so yeah that's how
I got popular
I pretty much I worked for it and that's
it for the questions and answers if you
have any question other questions that
you would like to know feel free to put
them at the bottom and I'll probably do
one of these like every now and then
with newer questions just to kind of
keep you guys updated because this is
really hard for me to try to answer
everybody's question individually
because it becomes tiring and I'm very
repetitive and then it just becomes
annoying so instead of just ignoring
people and not answering questions this
is the easy and best way to do it so I
hope you guys enjoyed this and I will
talk to y'all later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
