talk about some um I want to talk about
I don't know my topics are not usually
this easy I usually think about them
beforehand you don't see like I know
this is what I walk in I'm just a piece
of suede a nice beanie this is me on a
regular day like I'm not usually glammed
up unless I'm going somewhere for a
reason but usually if I'm like out and
about this is how y'all would see me but
anyway um I want to talk about focus cuz
I feel like a lot of times in life when
we go we start things hopefully I can
hear me if not I'm gonna just hide up to
forgive the audio but um in life I know
for me for the things that I've been
through and being going through recently
um focus is something that I'm very bad
with like I'll start something and be so
passionate about it and then by the end
of the day I didn't forgot all about it
you know maybe it's the stuff they put
in McDonald's or something I don't know
but I know for me my focus usually it
has to be something that's like really
really bad that knocks me off of my game
but usually net like now I have like
this thing where I will set myself to do
something I'll do it I'm gonna do a
video about how my living about reviews
are
not constructed but how they're edited
because I don't think people understand
that it is a long hard task
do these reviews and get them done
efficiently I don't know if it's just
selfie stick oh how to overcome a lot
there's a lot of on this channel that I
don't speak about there are a lot of
people on this show that I don't speak
about that I've hurt me in ways where
it's made me a little probably jaded and
a little angry in some areas but it
makes the makeup of who I am as a person
you know when certain people have said
things to me as a child that work
probably not the nicest or the most
considerate or evil yeah I don't take
 from nobody you know but it also
allows me to learn that you can't let
people get away with murder because of
who they are so rather be a family
member or cousin or sister a brother a
co-worker the idiot that can't drive in
traffic you know everybody doesn't get a
pass for being an ass you know you you
learn to just say this is who I am this
is what I go through this is part of me
either you you love it or you hate it
another question was what is like what
do I want what is my dream job um my
dream job would be not to work you know
somebody asked me what's my dream guy
like what what kind of guy do I like
today all my boyfriend's have been very
different cuz I don't have a I don't
have a type and when I say that I mean I
don't have a guy that says this is like
this Omarion let's just say Omarion my
aunt would be my dream dude so some
people would say oh this is the type of
dude that you would like this is how to
do that you you know type that's our
situation and
no it's about the person I've learned so
much I used to be like that I think we
always like that as like teenagers and
stuff but now when you really start to
understand a person to understand how
people work how they look I mean you
don't want them to just be a
beast but you want them to be some type
of attractive but have some type of
intellect about them you know that type
of situation what do you guys have in
common besides sex that type of thing so
that's what I look for in dudes like
what look how can you what can I learn
from you how can you stimulate me in a
way that's non-sexually where I can feel
you and we can have some type of bond
because that's how you grow with people
but yeah I don't have a type I don't
because I learned that just that pretty
much cuts off my ability to love and
people to love me if I'm not giving them
a chance everybody doesn't get a chance
I don't talk to everybody okay we don't
do that
but I feel like somebody has something
that I really enjoy are they're very
smart or beautiful or you'll be a
conundrum of thing they are into
something that I'm very into whatever
then I tend to understand that you need
to give this person a chance because
they can make the people one I don't
know do I believe in the one I I did but
not as much anymore
I I don't know maybe it's my dating
patterns or my past relationships but I
just don't really believe in the start
of the one you know because people are
very fickle
I think marriage is something that is
very beautiful so when I see a lot of
guys and girls here on YouTube that are
married you know I want to be married
and live in a house like deuce but we
don't know um we don't know what my
future is gonna bring I just know that
whoever whatever dude I marry he's gonna
have to have a lot of patience it takes
a strong man to date a bitch like
himself only because I know what I want
and I think today
things like dating and that's right but
it's not respected like people just do
to do go to go when they don't respect
you like that they'll say that's what
they want and play in actuality they're
just trying to code and pad what they
really want which I don't respect cuz I
think that's way I'm into different
things I'm I'm really into like aliens
like I love things about space the
unknown that's what it is like the
things like do aliens exist it will be
the highest of the food chain when it
comes to humanity or are we taught to
believe that just a lot of different
stuff I'm very I'm a nerd okay I just
got lucky that some people found me
attractive so then I got put into that
dome you look good but don't talk thing
but there when people get to know me
they understand that I'm into a lot of
things that most people like I don't
care about just just appease and
designer shoes and Louie Vuitton and all
it I like it it's beautiful it's great
stuff but I could school you on some
things while I wear those things you
know it's that type of thing so but I am
but I I do like the unknown the unknown
is something that really intrigues me
and I'll be on the internet all day
searching and looking for different
things as far as you know what exists
what doesn't exist you know is the
likeness real or is it
it just depends so as a person that kind
of intrigues my mom it boggles my mind a
little bit which is great because
Instagram is a great platform but it
gets really old really quick so I'd be
needing something in between tweets and
Instagram posts to keep my mind occupied
because believe it or not I don't sit on
the internet all day whoa
I don't sit on social media all day I do
find things to read I do I'm I'm a
creative person so I like to like um do
things like like come up with show ideas
and stuff like that for pilots and
different things so that helps so it
really just depends
um but yeah I am one of those people who
do I like what I like you know you can't
really change my mind about what I like
I'm just like this is what I'm into and
I don't really care who's into it who's
not it's just either you are
you're down what would one so yeah I
think you guys I think this walk was
needed you talk about this okay so Mike
one of my pet peeves about YouTube is
that I would love to do some music
videos to songs that I absolutely have
loved for the years someone's like
brainy's put that on everything like
that would be a really dope video um you
know Brooke I don't know if you guys
know Brooke and shoots music videos
they're very dope and I would love to do
that and I can do it the problem is the
copyright strike on YouTube which i
think is I understand because it's not
my material and you guys know that when
we make videos and stuff like that we
modernize the videos to make money so
that at the end of the month we can
collect the check for the amount of view
subscribers and all that good stuff that
we have gained in that 30 day period so
I get that part but I just wish it was a
way that I can modernize monetize the
videos
I don't I remember didn't care about -
hot dish you're gonna put a strike on my
account if I upload a song that's
copyright now know a company had asked
me to do like some stuff for a giveaway
and they send me a video and I uploaded
it and then they got a copyright strike
and there was like whoa we uh we're
gonna just take the song off the video
I'm gonna you gonna have to because I'm
not gonna leave that on my channel like
y'all about to get me in trouble
um so it's my little stuff like that
that I really hate any aggravates me
about you - like it's just stupid cuz
you know I want to be a diva and I can't
sing well rap I can rub a little Kim's
wraps but that's him
I hope you guys enjoyed vine stroll with
Dollface I hope you guys really liked
that Aggie</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
