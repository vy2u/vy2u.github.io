um I had exercise is this is a whole
bunch of questions that I've been asked
often and these are pretty much
frequently asked questions on Twitter
Instagram and all of it so we're gonna
do that and use maybe switch off the
water so the first question is are you
engaged No
okay well I'll explain though because
I'm a bitch
I'm not engaged you just know that I'm
very happy maybe there maybe I will be
engaged by any year I don't know you
know no it's just a great I'm right now
no baby daddy second right so no but no
it's for those who are asking will you
do a video on how you make the glitter
timberlands yes I will do a tutorial on
that but I didn't explain in detail I
had a problem with them actually
cracking on me after I wore them so I'm
showing the bigger place
so this is what they look like when I
but this is this is what they look like
when I first did them and after I wore
them this happened this nice crack
happened and on this side too is really
good but this can be fixed but this is
the reason why the tutorial has not been
done because I finally had to figure out
how to fix it so instead of hurry up as
soon as I knew what to do and I made a
tutorial I knew y'all all crap shower
shoes I've decided to wait I decided to
wait to figure out what to do to fix it
so there will be a tutorial for these
but you don't have the way cuz I realize
this but I am gonna do it it's just that
I am in get into it they cracked and
then I have to figure out I had to
figure out how to take some modification
now he's got a fine time to do it
but yeah okay so will you give us a
Cartman tour yet I will I just haven't
again had the time to do it between the
night of getting neutered
Richie's just being him doing videos
finding the couches that I really really
wanted finding this table that I really
wanted in life I just haven't had time
to do it so I think a lot of people
forget I'm not a blogger like that I'm
not one to share my life like that
I'm just usually very private so I don't
think twice like oh let me even do a
video and give them a tour oh my
Hartmann I just happen to but I will you
know you guys asking I work will you do
more videos with turbo and broken leg um
I don't know
and the reason why I don't know is
because we all just have so much going
on right now I think a lot of times you
guys forget that we are all individuals
and we all do different stuff and we all
have different things in life going on
sometimes we just don't have time to
kick it and shoot the and we do
kick it the last thing you want to do is
pull out the camera you know it's I know
for y'all didn't seem impersonal but
yeah this Connie is is there a possible
way that you can show us your workout
routine your abs are amazing thank you
but I don't work out so it's kind of
hard to show you something that I don't
do I think
crunches will help you sit-ups and I
heard those work but I really don't I'm
naturally skinny and I just naturally
happen to have abs and we have a gym
here at my apartment so sometimes I do
go down there I get on them to a
treadmill but down think that you've
done for my damn from for my abs but but
thank you though
and I also want to think I'm knows a lot
of you guys when I did my video
I forgot the bitch where you get that
video a lot of you guys were commenting
about my abs and asking me like have you
been working on you men working out I
have not done anything different the
only thing I've different ones I have
this lotion it's like self-tanner but
it's like a gold flakes in it so when I
put it on ages defines all of me and I
had it on that day because I was testing
it out to see how like they were job
actually below and he just made my ABS
like extra extra popping that was kind
of in but I ain't kidding that no
different
I promise y'all I just got any mouth
can you do a video on where you shop and
your deals for your designer shoes yes I
want to do a video on kind of how to
shop on a dime you guys know I am angels
everything naughty baby for lights and I
think with the exception about two pairs
of probably like the 50 pair that I own
I probably paid full price for all of
them I have got on sale so I'm gonna
show you guys how to get this on your
shoes on a budget you know what kind of
like do you use it looks amazing with
your skin and hair combination by the
way love you love you as well and I use
these stellar light ring white 18 inches
heinous it comes and mines has a
diffuser on it which is the O's clip
accuser I don't have the littles so go
plastic when I have like the sleeve that
goes over which already came on it so
yeah that's what I use what kind of
camera do you use it looks so amazing
well believe we're not I use my iPad
Mini 4 to report my videos the reason is
everybody thinks that I have I have a
Nikon camera
that's my I got a shutter issues right
now and I don't know who did it broken
but I you would think that I would use
that one but when I first started doing
videos I got accustomed to looking at
myself as you see I look here I look
here because I can see myself and
because I've been here with you is I
wanna make sure that my hair is always
popping and my you know my lip gloss
ain't looking a mess to mount my makeup
and look a mess I hope I lash and
falling off so it helps me to look at
myself and look at the camera
y'all know what I mean y'all I got a
custom me doing this for the longest but
because the screen is so big now on here
this iPad is clearly the spring is huge
and I would really use this to record oh
it has the same specs is that what I
think these are better but the Mini is
the one that I use and I use a
front-facing camera to do all of my
videos because I like looking at myself
when I do videos ah cuz I feel
self-conscious if I can't see what's
going on and I got accustomed to doing
this until I can use my ipod when I
first started doing video
I used to use my ipod to report my
videos when I used to sit on the floor
in the living room so that's where I got
accustomed to doing this and it just
works if I will find like a camera that
had output that I could use so I can
still see myself I would do it but yeah
that's the camera W where do you shop
because I love all the outfits that you
wear what did you find some of your
vintage one of the timepieces so I
chopped y'all if y'all hear anything in
the baggage the dogs they're just
playing so you're know or rabbit animals
and miles is just a freaking fright but
um I shop pretty much everywhere I like
the vintage stores I like forever 21 for
more of the stuff that I find there's
like like a lot of this stuff that I
wore in spring Queens all not a lot of
all the stuff I wore in sprinkling with
the exception of the pink Smith eNOS
stuff the leather and the actual like
sweater material in the beginning all of
that stuff came from forever21 dimension
outline so what I did was I pretty much
took that nice soft pink template that
they had in the show and I found Spurs
and skirts and shirts and put them all
together to create the looks that work
for that particular for that film
because I feel like a lot of this stuff
because they have a tumblr page
dedicated to scream queens fashion and
some beside was forever 21 but some of
the stuff like Chanel's fur jacket was a
like I think $4,000 meet jacket from
somewhere somewhere I wasn't by the box
so yeah you can get the it's kind of
like getting a look for less is what I
did with that and you can do but yeah I
pretty much shop everywhere any any
place I'm not against anything because
again like I'm not gonna find a brand
new Barbie jag I was that good much Tony
Alamo I'm gonna barber into one of those
so I have to get it use and just get a
dry clean and then you go about your day
but sometimes some vintage pieces like
that look great what do you do on your
off
I like to walk guys you guys know how to
do one video I think last year I was
walking and just talking and talking
about but do it today but is 8:00 at
night
so y'all with me it was t much but I do
like to go walkies and now I think in
Santa Monica they have like Rita rental
bikes from Metro Theatre like buy vitals
from fun but you can rent a bike and you
can ride it all around as far as you
want to go and a charges per hour to
actually ride the way I've been doing
that a lot lately but I like to bike
ride and I like to go walking is very
significant I'm not one that drinks a
lot on the drink socially and Tibetan
when you go out never now and I don't
smoke at all so to have that that outlet
of just being cool I love to go walking
it's very very very very now I mean
walking on Crenshaw I mean like walking
in a very nice neighborhood I like to
walk a mere peaceful neighborhood where
it kind of shows you with tangible and
showed me what my life to me one day so
it gives me a better outlook on what's
to come for me that's how I like to look
at me so yeah walking and now that I
have two dogs that's even more reason
for me to go walking so will you ever
show your current fiance if you do have
one or a boyfriend or your channel I do
not have a fiance guys I think that was
my first question with this I do not
have a fiance but no I would never show
who I'm with because I find that my
private life should stay private and a
lot of times I see like a lot of fellow
youtubers I see they've been with their
significant others for you know years
and he's I've been on my channel I've
never spoken about boyfriend's that I've
had you know guys that I've been with
but I just feel like that's something
private
you know I'm a very private person when
it comes to some stuff I'm very proud of
the things that are very close to me you
know are things that I love I'm not
really one to divulge too
because people tend to this is how if
the world wasn't so wicked then I think
I'll be more you know and then it just
sucks when you and that person if y'all
do break up and it doesn't work out that
everybody on your channel wants to know
what happened and if you don't address
it it just comes off kind of like you do
you know but yeah I think it's just best
to keep the personal life personal you
guys don't come on here to talk about
relationships with me or who I'm dating
you guys come over here to watch me meet
my face and do my hair and act silly and
stupid that's not what I'm here for you
know so no I know and the reason I was
right now this is the last thing good
money's not like a lot of my fellow long
show which I own and he's want me to be
successful and be happy so do you ever
plan to transition no and I get this and
I get I'm totally not irritated by this
question cuz I totally get it cuz right
now look like somebody's sister Spanish
um oh I just I don't I think what's
happening right now is that transition
is becoming such a a a bit of a fad for
a lot of the gay community because
they're seeing a lot of girls out here
doing it and anyone a part of it and
they don't really feel like they were
born in the wrong body or they feel like
their mind as a master body they're
doing it because it's popular and it's
something that they're they're very um
they just want to kind of be known for
like I'm gonna be the prettiest
transsexual out here that's what a lot
of them that's their point but for me
I've never felt like I was in the wrong
body I just happen to be a gay dude who
he likes a lot of hair of makeup and a
lot of clothes you know so I'll be
that's why I like to you know compare
myself to a Tom girl by calling myself
that I'm comparing myself to a tomboy as
a mountain girl because I like the
things that come along with it but
that's not what I want to be I like the
the look of it just like girls who don't
like to wear makeup and they like
basketball shorts in Jordan I don't want
to be a dude they just they're not into
the fully things in life that's the
opposite of me but I totally get the
question and I understand why that would
be a question I'm not dumb to the fact
that's just not
I don't live because I think and I'm
hoping like oh my god you transition you
would just be so bad it's like well why
though like that's not what I want to do
doing why would that make me better
because now I have hair boobs
you know like that's not something or I
have a vagina now so now what nice thing
is a room like it's not my thing but
thank you for the compliments about it
and you for the ones we just want
to kind of push me down you know the
trans gender role it's just not working
for me but you you stay in Hollywood I
do not stay in Hollywood I actually stay
in the valley against Sherman Oaks to be
very where is your dream place to live
in why I actually want to live in the
Palisades which if you guys are from LA
to know what I'm talking about
well I would rather three places I
really want to live I want to live there
all in California I want to live either
in the Palisades
Santa Monica no Palisades in Beverly
Hills or Cheviot Hills 103 all of them
they all work for me but it's because I
really like the environment and I really
like the home filling that those
particular places have Beverly Hills is
more than just Rodeo Drive it actually
has some very beautiful homes there and
I did a lot of shooting for spring
cleaning
they are matter-of-fact so it's a
significant amount of time there I walk
around you know I take the dogs walking
in that area I do a lot so yeah those
are kind of my dream places to live next
question it is mass killing your
favorite design man um I want to say
that mosquito is my favorite designer as
far as but if anybody was my favorite
designer would be uh Giuseppe Zanotti oh
just a month away so y'all know how I
feel but what I will say I can
understand how you will feel that way
the reason why I've been really into a
lot of you know as a lady is because of
journeys got you guys know me
your Germans got sand and he does a lot
of out-of-the-box stuff that I love and
works for me so yeah that's why I've
been but I mean I guess you could say
mosquito was one of myself yeah yes it
is
how was project Chucky coming project
Chucky is still words there with last
time y'all seen it I still ain't got
some damn overalls sewn however I will
get them sewn and I'm actually working
on some things that y'all made from pass
yeah I hope I answered a lot of you guys
questions and stuff like that this
wasn't very long but um if you guys have
any more questions write them at the
bottom so when I do this video again I
can just relate to these comments and
continue from there so I will get you
guiding them understand</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
