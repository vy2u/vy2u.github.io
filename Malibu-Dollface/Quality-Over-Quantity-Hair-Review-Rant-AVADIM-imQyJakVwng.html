when dumb bitches a dumb shit and
believed the dumb shit that they say
that's what this is a bitch oh okay oh
the review for this hair should already
be up you guys are watching this video I
want to talk about just what irritates
me about social media I guess you could
say and the things that people say is
just like what the fuck is wrong with
you you know one of the things that I
think is irritating the fuck out of me
right now and everybody's talking about
stable I've never seen so many so-called
walk people who've been half-asleep a
day in my fucking life everybody thinks
that everything is a conspiracy
everybody thinks that everything is an
issue everybody thinks that everybody as
I do I promise you like it's a lot of
shit going on in the world but I view my
here don't have all the fucking answers
you don't out of all bitches
you wasn't graced with all this great
knowledge oh Allah know so a lot of
times when people say oh it's a secret
are we even already talk about the damn
word secret I hear but every day I'm
secret you claim to know everybody else
knows which is not a secret no money
just how social media is now you guys
know how I do videos and right now it is
221 in the a.m. okay so I don't know if
my eyes are red but they could be not
sure I don't recall cuz these videos
have been spread out and they have been
like some has been four months ago some
of them recent some have been in between
and I'm uploading them as I go but some
videos that I uploaded my eyes are red
and that's because my context I was
using some old solution further than
good
and I realized I my water on my context
feeling like they sold like I got sand
paper in my eyes so you know when you
first put a minute for those who were
contacts I get all mine from Linda at me
and they are silica lenses so I don't
have any on today I'm still going to
think about it but I had a solo
do this and I want to do a red eyes so
yeah I put them in and then I took them
out and they were irritated obviously
and then I'm I have full makeup when I'm
not going to just put off my eyes with
Visine and then I my makeup looks like
I've been crying out of like hairy
cousin No
so in a couple videos my eyes were
extremely red but what if that was an
issue for me or whatever if anybody said
anything about them being red that
wasn't a problem with me the issue that
I had was the fact that people were like
all you smoke that do be right before
this are you with high as hell in this
video first and foremost this is work I
would never come to work hi I can't
remember anything
first of all I made it very clearly guys
that I do not smoke I don't have
anything against it I have siblings who
smoke like a chimney and it doesn't
bother me just not something that does
anything for me but I give me a headache
and I'm just going to say you smoking
the wrong stuff
no it just gives me a headache period oh
I don't like to smell a weed I don't
like the smell of our cigarettes I don't
like the smell of anything really with
the exception of hookah when it's like
flavor can smells really do like it with
cotton candy but I'm not a really big uh
personal smoke but I just think it's
really sad that now the generation is
that your eyes can only be read from you
being hot it can't be the fact that you
may have allergies we can't be the fact
that you may have you know ate something
wrong can't be the fact that you rubbed
your eye wrong can be the fact that you
may have put your contacts in and they
were possibly dirty it's the fact that
you have to be high as a lot of you high
mother fuckers who need to get out the
comments and get a fucking life and
maybe a job you know not everybody gets
high or unemployed with a lot of them
are just saying you know I have a lot of
people who on social media they they
make claims not only to me but just a
lot of our youtubers and some
celebrities where they say things in
which they feel as if they know you and
they're saying these things that are
opinions in a very sexual way
and it's like no that's that's not the
situation at all like actually that
makes absolutely no sense
this girl attempted to try to
read me I think that's what she she try
to do about how my hair reviews are done
and she said it was at a river view that
is now down because it's fucking company
governors but that hair was I don't
think people understand how hair reviews
work I get this hair out for at least
three months okay and I was at first it
was only for like a month and a half so
I pushing for another one so that's why
reviews will come out like a whole bunch
at one time because now those grew that
group of hair whatever we'll get to this
later but she was like I don't know if
you have a um I don't know what verb is
she used we're pretty much do you have
an alliance with these hair companies
where you have to be nice now some
people say I'm nice some people say I
mean is held on algae growth the
gentleman fuckers in it but I'm like
well Sears are things I don't have an
alliance with anyone and the thing about
her reviews is that regardless of the
logistics of everything my whole sole
job is to be honest if I don't like
something I'm gonna tell you I wanted to
hear and I didn't want the bottom they
didn't like how and look I quite frankly
it was what it was to me I didn't see
much care for it but the hair quality
wasn't the issue it was the fact that
the frontal did not hello hello you see
everything Majesty everything is very
uniform here I'll have to go in and try
to fix anything this is what curly hair
is supposed to look like okay wait here
whatever is all supposed to be one unit
it's not supposed to be for different
damn textures and that was the issue
that was happening so if I give any
anything up under five when I give the
rating process when I remember to do so
I don't review if I'm not in people
don't why don't you review bad here well
here's the thing just like you I get the
same 24 hours in my day okay and the
last thing I'm going to do is get it
here from a company the hair is already
giving me problems trade out the damn
box
I wore the hair for down there three
months at this point you want me to do a
review for them you're ten minutes to
tell you what I don't like about the
hair then you want me to edit the video
about how much I dislike the hair
you want me to go and put up an intro
for hair that I hate who has the time
will I ever get that time back
no I will not so therefore when all is
said and done I'm not going to sit up
here and waste not only my time well
your time in the company time what I can
do is give them some vital information
and say hey what you need to do is pull
that whole entire line which I'm doing
and they you know and I've had companies
even US companies say I'll be like I
tested that hair growth as a no-go don't
do that a name like ok I'm just gonna
sing but I got back to my supplier and
call it a day you know but people this
is not something that I feel like I have
to explain but I'm going to explain for
those who don't get it to think about
YouTube especially when it comes down to
us as reviewers is that this is a free
service meaning you subscribe to a free
service so that means if you don't
choose to buy something you don't have
to understand how by the hair on my head
I'm not saying it I'm giving you another
option the problem is a lot of people
are lazy and they take only my word for
it I could've had a great time with it
it can be no different for me buying an
iPhone and I love my iPhone and somebody
who says that they try nice home for the
first time hate it because they feel
like it's not like their Android our
experiences are different because our
walks of lives are different based on
what we're using so then you have people
say well why is it not the same it
seemed like makeup gurus are a little
more trustworthy than hair gurus what
see the difference is when a makeup guru
gets anything for free or if it's paid
or the PR or whatever the situation is
but if the makeup guru does not have to
live with the highlighter they don't
okay you have to go out with they put it
on and they say if they like I can say
right there they like it or not now
after an hour or so did it crack
probably not you know can you still see
probably they don't have to decondition
their highlighter okay they don't have
to make sure that they spell and make
their new lippy into a week they don't
have to do that they don't have to make
sure that their new eyeshadow palette
the edges on it are the frontal on it
matches they'll have to do that so our
jobs are very different so you're
comparing apples to oranges yes we do
review but what we do are very different
now I don't know about what the rest of
these girls on YouTube we're doing
because I have nothing to do with me
I don't worry about the people's pockets
I don't worry about other people's
channels and their content because I
begin you have nothing to do with this
so I'm telling you from me to you my job
is to let you know if I like something
if I have a great experience with
something that I'm going to tell you yes
I can only go by what I have now if the
companies are choosing to send me good
hair and y'all bad hair then when y'all
come back and let me know this is a
reason why I don't work with a lot of
companies no more I know if y'all have
noticed but there's a company company
that I was very loyal to those over no
more and the reason why I don't do that
is because I don't think it's fair that
when you were a smaller company and you
were working with me you were sending
out everybody great stuff and then I
started to get back that people now
after about a year of you being out and
having great reviews and now you're
sending people trash and you still want
me to review for you I don't want to
review because now you have me out here
pushing a product that's not what you're
sending out which is a problem but these
are issues and problems that I think
over the company not what you got in a
lot of you guys who have got stuff that
I didn't like and I'll help y'all get
y'all money back okay
so I do what I can I am only one person
so that means I can only give my one
perspective perspective on something but
this is a chant it is a site where there
are presence of thousands of people who
do the same thing that I do and people
want to take because I guess I have the
amount of clout
I don't know my opinion for what it is
honey I appreciate you guys I really do
but again before I buy anything okay
I'll go to somebody one of the tech
channel that I follow he loves his new
iPad pro whoo now let me go over to this
girl she just brought it she don't
really too much like it the reason why
she don't like it is because of this is
that the third now I get her point so
now I'm gonna make an informed decision
to say he got it for free she paid for
it he loved it because he's a fanboy she
didn't like it because she should be an
Android user
she don't feel like there's a difference
between her phone and back I get it so
that I make a decision I would just go
about what he said or she said and
that's the problem
a lot of these guys buy things because
you say a is great and then you hate it
this is happening with eyeshadow
palettes isn't happened with hair
doesn't happen with shoes cuz I put a
lot of music shit I got a lot which I
can get refunds for so yeah when it
comes down to it I think a lot of times
on social media people think that they
know you and they think that they
understand how you run and they think in
and again when you assume you make an
ass out of you and this is why a lot of
times when people try to come at me I
dig it ass because you don't have no
clue what I do and how I run my shit
okay because you're not helping me make
wigs that's what you what you ask you
for one for free by the way um you're
not you know you're not doing anything
that I'm doing and the reason why you're
getting that with all you gurus here
free hair if you did what I did you
could probably get a whole bunch of out
your free hair too but the fact that
johast want to be a lazy ass bitch and
beg me or ivy or lakiya for our shit
that lets me know that you just really
don't give a fuck and you just want
something for free because you feel like
you're oh that I owe you shit if I said
everything fair that I had and never
gave it away fold it or whatever that
still will be my business because it's
my shit I don't get it I have the same
24-hour that you have I have the same
pockets that you have depending on what
you and I do
I made away from myself she's made away
for herself he's made away for this show
so problem with people today is they hit
Matt as a smaller person who became a
bigger person because they decided to
climb a little bit longer than you they
decided to do something it's usually the
people who have the most opinion on
people don't botch it
they're the ones who usually talk to
most in the comments I'll see the same
girl them same as pictures your icon is
Katy Perry Rihanna
Aaliyah all these people that you ain't
and then you sit there and you have an
opinion about every single thing and yet
show as may have not a door bells ring
with shit that show access purchase so
those are the bitches that I used to get
it and there's every issue with somebody
they like you up I you not brought this
because of you and I liked it
for a little bit and it didn't work I
usually go back to the phone you brought
here and in February and then you wore
it to April and then you said it was
back honey
why the fuck didn't you go back to the
first week the car is bad it's going to
go bad as soon as you drive that shit
off the lot that's that but just a
Coulomb per bitch it's gone it's not
it's going to overheat it's not going to
wait so you know two three months down
the line and fuck up you're going to see
some signs before you get to that ending
point that something was wrong the thing
that people don't get about Alex Perez
and all of these companies as opposed to
other companies is that when we as
reviewers only review US companies the
hair was too expensive then we take on
Aliexpress and all these in Amazon
companies and now the hair sucks so my
question to the viewer is why are you
expecting a bitly and you only have
enough money for a price of 300 won't
you just take what you got and get what
you need
and what about your day why are you
trying to do something and you don't
like the result I can't get mad and say
well I don't like my car because I
thought I was gonna it was going to sell
like a billy but it feels just like a
Chrysler to see still shitty cheap it
doesn't ride like a billy because that's
not what it is so you if you see that
diamond virgin hair is selling this nice
mint hair for seven hundred and
something dollars and you need four
bundles
but that's going to cost you upwards to
them is two thousand dollars but then
you see darling Christ
got some very similar hair and there's
only two hundred and forty nine dollars
for four bottles and a pump that's a
reason why they can sell it for that
cheap and they can sell it for that much
because the quality is different people
I don't think people get the quality
this curly hair this teeny curly hair is
not the same quality as other curly hair
that I have had it is not however for
the price point that it is it's great
hair I'm not saying buy any may means
that this is comparable over anything
else a tie
at that cost more and sometimes it do
mean it I mean a very rare but a lot of
times it do be situations where I'm like
I mean is here is better than I have a
lot of strain from aliexpress that I
think it's better than what I get from a
lot of us-based companies just because
sometimes they're there straight hair
isn't my favorite not everybody but
because I work with Aliexpress some more
and I've worked at a lot of US companies
in the past I can compare and contrast
the two a lot of times when people want
to do what they want to live on a Paris
Hilton budget but they're only on aid
but your own you you just begun your
beat you know beginning of black China
news circa 2009 so it's not the same you
know so you have to do your research and
again a lot of times when you buy things
that are cheaper that's why is the
difference between store brands and name
brands and people like was not a
difference to me
Cheerios and oh oh tastes very different
okay cinnamon toast crunch and cinnamon
swirl ain't the same thing marshmallow
mateys and um Lucky Charms
so not the thing although I'm just
rehearsing in an instance I do prefer
marshmallow matey's over blue Lucky
Charms it's just if the preference for
me some people can wear off-brand lotion
and feel like it and moisturize every
may do but I like Jurgen just saying you
know you can have a nice deodorant I
like of just a preference you know I
could get the or glasses or I get to
plum line I want to just the preference
so understand that when something is
cheaper you have to compare the two
because there's a reason why that's
cheaper there's a reason why you tires
are cheaper than brand-new tires
they're the reason okay why you can get
a used car versus a newborn that is the
quality that is the difference
I think that's what's irritating me is
that people don't know the difference
between quality and quantity they don't
understand the two so I give you options
for sure you know but hair is a
necessity
I mean hair is a luxury it's not a
necessity unless you are a person who is
suffering from cancer lupus alopecia or
anything else within that realm that's
the only time where I select here is a
necessity because for a lot of people
especially women here is something that
makes you feel beautiful so I can
understand that but a lot of y'all who
just wants it you know you lot about you
a virgin
you'll go out here you choose for 5-10
pairs a little time but then you still
want to wear a liqueur clear and they
get mad when the hair doesn't last you
six months
well girl you only paid 244 with all of
it
that ain't a bun all of it be happy with
what you get out of that and if you
would like something that's going to
last the test of time and not saying
that's all us-based companies and all
the expensive hair is something that is
going to last you a lifetime but what I
will say is you have a better chance
with that then you do what Aliexpress is
very different a lot of their hair is
just that it's processed hair it says
virgin but it's not virgin if you this
this curl pattern is not a natural curl
patter period I didn't sister intro but
it don't mean that this was t and Tamara
texture but it's very comparable for
that look that I'm trying to do
I can save hundreds of dollars with this
look as opposed to buying it if I will
get some raw virgin hair from somebody
you know so keep that in mind I just
wanted to kind of get that off my chest
a little bit because I feel like a lot
of people they speak about nothing that
they know about I don't know shit about
sports so I don't speak about it if
somebody fumbles the ball
that's just what it he all don't know
what the fuck bumble me I guess fuck up
I don't know but I'm not going to tell
this guy who clearly knows what the fuck
he's doing how does his job and I hate
when people try to come and tell me how
to do my job because when all is said
and done in my job I'm not doing that
great of a job to you why are you here
okay usually things that I don't feel
like are so great I usually just kind of
move forward as a dead
but you know yeah people want to stop
and complain and say you know I could
still girl shut about the bunker
I don't the carpet I don't give the I
don't give a one o'clock I run to the to
fuck I don't give a red plug onto the
blue fuck just say so there's like a
mini rant you know again quality over
quantity and understanding and that
bitch they'll get y'all in my next one
and I was overdue for this hair up below</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
