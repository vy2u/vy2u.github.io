divas la first episode review and prefer
yahoo keep ask me about my um Love &amp;amp; Hip
Hop review I'm gonna do it at the end of
the season I usually do like mid season
and in season but since I've been so
busy and I just like this season it's
just been a little dry to me so it's not
really nothing much to report on that we
didn't know from last season in my
opinion so it's kind of like it is what
it is but ok um but yeah i watch um R&amp;amp;B
divas la comes on TV one if you don't
have TV one uh you can check your local
listings or I don't know those are you
can go to TV 1.com maybe I'm not sure um
but is an urban channel like BTW but not
as a not as ghetto yeah um yeah I know
then I know everybody on the on the cast
pretty much like I'm familiar with all
the women on the cast but imma go down
each woman because I have an opinion
about what's going on and maybe if you
never watch the show like the UH the
Atlanta version or whatever then this
might actually make you want to watch it
I don't know oh yeah i just took my
weave out and it's a hassle you know I
thought you it'll be back so my got some
more hair coming on shrimp y'all don't
trip doesn't tutorial inscription on its
just oh ok so anyway um the first person
on the cast is Kelly Price and you guys
know I mean I'm sure you guys know of
kelly price if you don't know who Kelly
Price is I'm sure you've seen her harder
on a track you've seen her somewhere
you've heard about her waist her weight
loss you've were heard about her weight
gain um yeah you know but Kelly I've
never like been a huge Kelly Price fan
but I have been um one of those people
that has admired the things that she's
done I think she's a great phenomenal
singer so I mean you all if you can sing
you get my respect that's how i feel
about any
if you can sing you have my respect as
long as you're not a bitch and Kelly
doesn't seem to be that but the season
just started so you know and judging by
that trailer kid it's gonna get a little
heated um the next person is chante
Moore you know she's known for sean
Hayes got a man that's like the only
song that people know her from besides
Frank shut up other than that nobody
knows John say more like that like me
she's still you know she still sells
records you know good to me she still
sells record she just not a
international star that everybody and
they mama is familiar with but she's
very beautiful she reminds me of
somebody that i used to know like as far
as her her bone structure in her hair
and everything or whatever but chante
seems like she's kind of very down to
earth cool type of chick she doesn't
necessarily seem like she's a young a
 starter but she do like she's a
 finisher so I like that about her
um the next person is LUMO ok nellik
lomo is cool little mo is um she has a
beautiful voice she can scream her ass
she can scream yeah like Fantasia she
could scream however I don't really see
the point of her name being little mo
because everything about her is big her
personality her ass her nose her lips
her eyes her face her jawline like
everything of her weave everything about
her is big so our names shibby big moe
instead of little mo but maybe it's like
an oxymoron I don't really know he's so
you know whatever but little most seems
like a starter and she seems like
she's going to be the the problem this
season because at the end of it they
showed a trailer shared them cocaine
white glasses on talking about some
bitch you ain't from Beverly did it yeah
and you know when she asked her she
chante about you know what's going with
you man she was like I'm cuz you know
I'm nosy you know it with the whole
Beyonce's here and I'm trying to get
here that is a great
that's a great thing to strive for
however mismo um you are not Beyonce I
wish you guys a lot of these artists
would stop trying to stop striving to be
the next somebody and be the first them
because as great as Beyonce can think
she can't on sing little mo however
little mo does not have what beyonce has
so she need to take what she got deal
with that make that work like
Ciara um and do what you can do because
little mo can sing circles around half
of the industry however her attitude is
bad her looks are not up to par and
that's not me being saying she's ugly
that's just what the industry standards
you know that's what that is and then on
top of all of that um I don't really
think that little mo is like a performer
she's a performer when it comes down to
the church but you know to to hold if
she was at the Super Bowl I don't really
think I would would have cared is I
didn't really care much for Beyonce
anyway I mean the performance was great
I wasn't anticipating it little more
awkwardness I would have said who the
 pull those strings you know it's
just like who cares um so yeah little mo
I'm actually excited because she's I
like her energy her energy is what's
going to continue to make me watch the
show um the next person is Michelle a I
don't know if it's miss chalet uh Michel
a her name is Michelle what you
heard um with the hyphens bitch
your name's Michelle but i do remember
Michelle lake from when i was younger
and my grandmother really loved there's
something in my heart song and my mom
and them would play you know NWA and all
that so she was around the time
when when rap I really was like making a
forefront and putting this stamp on
where it is and where it kind of stands
today so she's actually part of like a
lot of history she just as you can see
now her voice and I know y'all gonna ask
me about the voice I knew when I was
younger to her voice was that high
because she would talk on the songs but
her singing voice does not reflect her
um her listening her her thing was not
reflect her talking boys ok so that's
the problem because she sings about here
her here she talks all the way up here
so she was like I'm in a guy at the at
the bar and he has me he'll even with a
nice restaurants a trip everybody should
night oh my god again like imagine her
during sex that is the molestation is
what its gonna sound like because if I
didn't not know that she spoke like that
and she was in a room with a little girl
I would swear those with two little
girls having a conversation michelle lay
your voice I mean there's nothing she
can do about it you know saying but her
interviews is in its I like I have to
act as light as my voice can get i still
cannot with her she reminds me of
like a little Toya Jackson even with the
nose because miss chalets nose is like
this um yeah speaking of latoya jackson
in plastic surgery um a lot of y'all
know that i am a huge chucky fan and i
love chuckie with every ounce of my
being and you guys I'm a big big fan and
I did see the trailer for curse of
chucky the new straight to DVD movie
that's coming out and Chucky looks like
a Botox plastic surgery disrespectful
ass mess and Don Mancini I am very hurt
about what you have done to my nigga I'm
hurt but back to your regular scheduled
program um yeah Michelle a I don't know
how I'm gonna deal with the whole voice
situation because it's kind of killing
me but by the end of the episode I
actually kind of got used to it a little
bit so maybe a couple of more episodes I
will probably be good but she just she
has a nice body to be I don't shame in
an industry in 20 years I don't really
think God will really care about I'm
Michelle a album after 20 years like if
I was Oh popping like if she was kind of
like we she was never like Rihanna but
you know she was popping for a second so
I don't think her fanbase will kind of
embrace her like oh no Michelle laughing
like um but um we'll see what happens
the next person is Don Robertson
envogue now don has always got a very
bad rap and invoke because judging from
what I've heard about her to see her on
the show I don't know if this is a new
found on or whatever the situation is
but she's definitely not a she's not
other person that I thought she was
gonna be um she says she's different so
she's nice she seems like a sweet heart
which I like so um the the misconception
about her was definitely broken and she
seems like a cool person she really
doesn't seem a share as much besides the
fact the she wants baby um really
doesn't seem I she saw that all that
interesting but will walk on the sea um
the next person is my girl Claudette
Ortiz from City High now Claudette look
she's the person that made me want to
besides Michelle lays voice um she's the
person that made me want to actually sit
down and watch the show because I always
wonder what happened to city high
because what would you do was my jam and
so it was caramel I have their album now
the boy the whole situation with her and
the members of the group threw me off
because through the grapevine I had
heard that she had a baby with Wyclef
now apparently my sources were very
 up because she was with
the niggas in the room so if you guys
watch or you ain't watching you watching
this then you don't feel like watching
the show I McGee low back story she was
in ruekar city huh she was the only
female like how Lauryn Hill was in a
Fugees like that it was two guys in one
girl and I think that's what Wyclef was
trying to go for with them but you know
where I didn't work out but everybody
always asks kind of what happened or
whatever so she was with Robbie which
was more of the chunky lighter do in the
group when I got together he had drug
problems he had drinking problems and
all this other stuff he became she said
mildly abusive that means that it was
bad um she's just trying to be nice
about him um and then she they broke up
and in the midst of that she got with
the US she leaned on the other member of
the group and they got that she got
pregnant by him
and they got married and they were ready
for 11 years and then they produced two
children and she has another child I
don't know who the baby daddy is I
thought it was white gloves but
apparently I'm wrong it could be it
could be so she's out here with three
kids from Jersey and the thing about how
that is she's such a beautiful girl with
a beautiful voice but her personality
you can tell that life has definitely
pulled her by her panties backwards
because she everything about her seems
forced like I'm forcing myself to be
happy i'm forcing myself to be cool you
know she doesn't really seem as if she's
all that excited you know I'm saying
about life interesting like I'm a mom
things don't go my way and here we are
that type of thing um so yeah I'm
curious to know because her backstory
seems very very very very interesting um
the next person is I'm am missing some
other did I say everybody um I think
that's it I think I said everybody if
i'm not mistaken um so yeah I mean
there's not really anybody in this cast
that I don't like I will say this though
they went to this so boy in uh LA and I
ok let me tell you something about the
subway in LA ok they were there they
made it on TV look like it was the most
pop in his club in LA and don't get me
wrong and certain nights it do be
popping but from one of my recollection
are right around the corner and I can I
mean oh right around the corner was
maranello duty school where I went for
beauty so yeah it's like oh it's Marcus
Street is right there um and that club
when I was in school was known to be
like a cat daddy club that was like
where your granddaddy and his old ass
home his name Clarence and John
went to you know I'm saying in Philippe
like I the Savoy apparently has changed
its rules over there because that was
definitely a cat at a club but I digress
um so yeah um
the season look like it's going to be
very very interesting every woman like I
said can actually sing which I love the
intro and the song in general is better
than a TLS the women on this cash um
they is something about them that I like
a lot vs atl and i think because of the
fact that these women seem like they're
actually on their game to try and want
to do something with themselves like
wholeheartedly they're really trying to
ato didn't really seem like that it
seemed like it was more so over the
drama and this damn tour that they kept
talking about Danny put ng stone Bulldog
ass face like bitch nikki was definitely
not trying to be the ugly one last
season but okay um so yeah it seems like
um it's going to be very very very
interesting and you better believe that
my ass has an opinion I will be tuning
in every Wednesday night to make sure
that I let y'all know what's going on so
I probably will do weekly updates on
this unless they get dry like Love &amp;amp;
hip-hop and then I was found but yeah
like I said Love &amp;amp; Hip Hop that's coming
up on and I love the fact that they're
in LA to possibly do some type of play
situation I mean it's only the first
episode so who knows um but I imagine
Michele a like arguing with somebody
with that voice the disrespect like
mm-hmm but let me go to let me know what
y'all thought of this episode I watched
it yesterday because if you have time
warner cable like I do um they put it on
on the men already so I watched it
actually monday so yeah I just want you
guys to check it out if you have in and
let me know what you thought about it in
how do you think the season compares
just judging by the UM judging by the
trailer in the first episode do you how
do you think it compares to it ato are
believe is atl so yeah let me know I'm
not going to talk about the reunion for
atl only because
they selena and nikki is talking about
that same however I want cuz listen
syleena johnson got a little snippy with
me on our Twitter because I told that
bitch she had a mullet in couple
episodes she did have a mullet though
like don't get me she had a mother
