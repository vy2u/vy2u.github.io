the Beyonce inspired Bob wig you guys
know that I did a video where I clicked
one of my my Khloe Kardashian inspired
wig or whatever
I cut it into a bob and right after I
did that RPG show released this Beyonce
collection of different wigs inspired by
Beyonce and this was one of them
so I'm gonna give you guys all of the
description about the Wigan I'll go in
aspects and what I do and what I do not
like about this particular unit okay so
the hair the hair code is SC 0 1 1 s - s
the hair colors the likes like the
celebrity the hair length is 10 inches
the hair texture is silky that is
debatable the hair density is a 100
percent medium the cap constriction is a
cap three glueless cap the cap size is a
1 the lace color is a light brown and it
says please do not cut lace off if you
are not satisfied with your wig just
concept this okay and then it comes with
some instructions about how to keep your
lace right and then it came with the you
know the lunch lady knit and all that
good stuff and then it came with the
brush that I were looking and like this
like the wig was wrapped in this with
the lunch lady in it and then it comes
with the RPG show brush which I never
used because these were just don't seem
to grip nothing compared to this brush
it rips everything um so yeah the wig
was very easy to apply it didn't give me
any issues um it does look like
Beyonce's hair it's a little different
from me because it's like really blonde
um but it does have like the asymmetry
that she had and the back I would turn
around but I don't feel like doing all
that but the back is I mean it's cut
it's cut at an angle out for the picture
it's cut in angle or whatever and it's
like what they said is going to be the
thing that I have an issue is is the
issue that I have with the last one and
it's that whoever did the color did not
such a hot job because the wood is dry
and I put a lot of oil in it I had to
put a lot because he wasn't doing this
at first it wasn't doing none of this at
first so if you do want this particular
unit and you like the way that it's
cutting you like the color and all of
that I would suggest that you um deep
condition it first and then wear it
because if you wear like this and you
wear it out the bag like this then um
it's gonna be dry and I mean I don't
know about yours but the one I can only
speak for what I have and then you like
I like show you guys I have to do an
honest review because I don't want you
guys to buy something that you
necessarily you know I've raved in about
and it was not the best but other than
that I like it I like it a lot I don't
think I would keep this color per se for
me I think the color is a little bit too
light for me and maybe I say I buy
around the same color she may be a shade
or two lighter depending on I'm a little
bit darker because of my foundation
routine going on right now um but it
looks better with makeup because I tried
it on last night with no makeup and it
looked horrible
so it's not my favorite however it's not
the worst it's just that maybe I need
some you down a little bit color maybe a
candy color I might put on here and then
it'll probably be perfect maybe a red I
don't know but yeah um it's a nice wig
because the cap construction it has the
two combs in it it has the adjustable
strap in the back so you can kind of
make it as tight or as loose as you want
um it went all fine the lace was easy to
cut off it doesn't itch or anything I
did my you know my laid method that I
showed you guys in my last couple of
videos on how to do to get it to lay
like you want to because it was big the
wig is thick and I will say that it is
it's very thick and that's why I said it
being a silky it's kind of debatable
because it feels more like a yaki and it
probably feels like that because of the
fact that it was bleach
and I don't know who does their bleach
these jobs over at RPG show but they
have to kind of get this down pact when
it comes down to the color because
nobody wants a dry wig you know and it's
like it's beautifully cut and it's great
and everything but it's not it's not
silky it's not like when you eat to the
touch
it's not a cookie like I would want it
to me so yeah I love the color
um I just want to tone it down maybe I
might actually just put a toner on it
and keep it this with honey and make it
more like a honey blonde color not so
much bleach blonde um or am I just going
to put like a aquamarine color on it or
something like that and just have like a
really funky I'll do that
as a matter of fact I'll come back and
update you guys with the color I think
if I take on two bottles to actually get
this exactly like I want it but um yeah
I think I'm gonna pray right after this
go to the beauty supply and go get like
a bottle color and just drench it and
they could probably come back sometime
this week and show you guys what I did
with it but other than that is a pretty
good wig I just I think a deep condition
will just simply help it Ilia um if you
guys have any questions other than what
I just explained let me know and you can
get this wig at RPG show thank them for
sending the wig to review and like
always I will talk to you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
