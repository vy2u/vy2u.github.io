oh that part though what okay guys um I
know it's been a while since I've done a
review from RPG I think so um but yeah
this week that I have on right now is
from RPG show I'm giving you today I'm
kind of giving you hood Morticia Addams
you know what the Alexander Wang ah I
got the mama you know why I mean a wife
more colors though the gold chain little
stomachs
I feel like a Leo more than a woman well
um so anyway this week that I'm wearing
um it is 24 inches long and I wanted to
trying to kind of change the camera up
so you can see how long it actually
falls what I've been doing this this is
hands-down the best RPG show wig I've
got thus far and normally I will
complain about one thing about this wig
and it's that it's not full as I would
like it but other than that the wig is
perfect um so I'm gonna give you guys
the specs on the wig this wig is the CLS
0 1 - s the hair length is 26 inches not
24 um my bad it's a 1b is silky as a cap
1 construct cap instruction is a 3-mile
ice is like brown and again for always
and forever if you do not like a wig
from RPG show do not cut the lace off
the wig so you can send it back so I'll
get to what I did to this wig and
everything and kind of of course the
pros in the cons and things I'll do what
I don't like okay first off the obvious
this is as thick as the wig is so
literally this is how thick it is it's
no fuller than this there's no hair in
the back this is all the hair pull to
the front now for most of you guys this
is enough hair for me right now this
isn't of hair um but normally I will go
for like I would put like a whole nother
bundle in this wig um which I'm going to
UM just to give it a little bit more
fullness but other than that this way
it's perfect like look at the part y'all
but
that oh my goodness and it's shiny and
it's nice I put some some of this in it
so please don't be alarmed this is my
Flatiron spray so um a just gave me a
little bit more shine and it's coming
off much shinier on here than it is in
person because it's like um when I
received the wig the one great RPG shot
know you're watching so please just can
we not do this again ever again in life
there was this piece right here was cut
all the way already in the wig this
piece right here so what I had to do was
I had to take my shears and go in and
pretty much try to match the layers all
the way down as much as I could because
this is kind I don't want to cut too
much of this off because once you cut
this it ain't growing grow bag so that
sucks
so I pretty much cut as much as I could
down to try to give this this layer feel
because if I didn't then the way would
have just been I would have really
looked like Morticia Addams like for
real um so I kind of wanted to give it
like a little bit so when I did kind of
wear one side over my shoulder like this
it kind of gave me this you know where
it's not all the way up my face I still
have something here but it all Cascades
like it's supposed to but yeah it's
really silky it moves which you gotta
love um and I will say because it is not
a lot of hair most of you guys will be
able to get away with this
and kind of function within your day you
guys know I wear five bundles 34 inches
and I can get in my car go swimming and
put my hair in a bun and I'll be fine
but for most people for every day here
at work or you just want to go out on a
you know on the town to have that much
hair in your head and you're trying to
get drunk and you trying to have fun or
just look cute sometimes for everybody
is not okay so this is actually a good
alternative um it's a good alternative
for those who don't want to have that
issue of um having too much hair or you
just don't like your hair that fool like
everybody doesn't like to hear 85
bundles full so cool right whatever um
yeah so yeah this is this is pretty much
it when I received it and with a little
lunch late in it this is the lace that I
cut off of
it which is this right here and then I
got I receive um
this another wig liner and um an
instruction manual you guys know I'm
sure come y'all start sending those
weight caps again and stop sending the
wig liner's please because I don't like
those um and then I just put some
concealer on my part and I just parted
it all the way back uh I call this the
Kardashian part where they go very far
back to me it looks a little more
realistic when you part it that far back
because it's like okay so it looks like
everything is covered and it's you know
how it was supposed to be when it stops
right here it's okay but it still looks
a little off but I was going for like
this dramatic look and I was gonna put
on some like dark lipstick with this too
but I can't find my black lipstick to
say in my life so this is gonna have to
do survive okay whatever but this is
from RPG Charlemont
or again this is style number CLS 0 - 1
- s it's in 20 remember I got this
custom um because there I think the
stock weight was 22 inches and I just
cannot they're 22 inches that is just
like Obama to me so they end up they
went ahead and gave me this 26 inches
I'm so okay um yeah I hope you guys like
this and if you guys wanna know how I
got my part so straight or how I makes
it look how I made it look realistic
there will be a link below I've done
this before
so you know you guys is saying if I do
it on the side I try to give you guys a
middle part cuz I know you guys like if
you were another side part right here
I'm gonna kick you um I'm getting shiny
so I'm gonna go now but I hope you guys
like this and I'm talk to y'all later
bye bye look hard like my heart off
before I go what my brush before I go
just check all the nice views thing all
of that movement
mmm-hmm goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
