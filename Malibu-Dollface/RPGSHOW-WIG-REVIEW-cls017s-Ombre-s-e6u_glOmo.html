this wig that I'm wearing and it's from
RPG show I'm sure you guys are familiar
with RPG show um most of the beauty
gurus that I know of have already done
reviews for them so you know this is
pretty standard a few watch videos if
you have not ever seen RPG shell video
then I'm happy this could be your first
and this is getting away okay so this
wig is a it's the hairstyle c LS 0 1 7 -
as the hair color is like the picture
this color is based on a Khloe
Kardashian I call this the Chloe wig
because that's what it pretty much was
reminds me of its Chloe - Ian yeah
it's 20 inches is silky it's a cap 1 the
cap construction is a glueless cap oh it
says just don't cut if you're not
satisfied everywhere RPG show our stuff
don't cut the lace off just in the back
I got this a wig probably like a week
and a half ago and I have been so busy I
have not had time to review it um the
wig came it came with the knit over it's
like you know those classic NYX they put
like it's I call them the lunch lady
knit they came with that over the wig
and then it came in this plastic bag it
came with thank you for basically
purchasing with a king with a wig liner
which I don't understand why they send
you these because they don't do nothing
like especially because this is the lace
wig it's not a silk base so if you put
this on and you can see you're gonna be
able to see the lines through the lace I
think they should just start sending
caps and then it comes with a
instructions of lace wig basically this
tells you if you never had a lace wig
before this pretty much tells you the
washing the combing how to apply it if
it was like a glue you know that's type
of situation but this is not a glue this
is a glue list lace wig
I like the hombre color there are a few
things about this look that I do not
like like the fact that this hair is
everywhere but um the few things that I
like when I first got it it was like um
at the ends where the color is it felt
like it was like a residue on it sounds
like I'll just wash it you know
sometimes things happen in whatever
whatever
oh this also came with a wig brush it's
like a classic wig brush it's just in
the room I just don't feel like getting
it
um but yeah but when I first got it it
had like this residue on her sauce just
washed it once I washed it came right
out it was no issue but since I've been
wearing it and I'm okay since I've
basically been trying it on because I
have not worried I just been pretty much
trying it on I've noticed that the hair
seems a bit dry at the bottoms and I
deep conditioned it but it still seems
very dry and it didn't come with these
layers in them I cut them in myself
because obviously you know everything
just be straight down I try to lay it as
much as I could but it just doesn't want
to really lay down for me um like my
other ones have this one seems like it
has more of uh it's a little more dense
at the top and I would like it to be
because this actually is a really pretty
color and you guys know I don't never
wear a color I'm like I'm a black head
till a dye type of person but I did want
to try something different because I
know some of you were like well you will
probably look pretty because we're I'm
ready to review for it was another wig
and it was like a off brown color it was
still almost black but it was like off
around there I was like you look really
cute with the color and I like this
color um I just wish it was like it's a
silky texture but it feels like more
like a yaki texture because of the it's
also dry at the bottom which kind of
sucks um besides that it's lace it's not
um it's not a silk base it's lace I try
my best to try to conceal it but um this
is why I don't mess with lace closures I
try not to merciless closures or lace
wigs I like to do this still tops
because they are so much better and as
you can see right here I was very lazy
when it came down so
what it happens um what else
oh this um this lanes it's 20 inches and
it feels a little shorter than me I
haven't not measured it it can vary
very well between the inches I don't
really think they would lie about the
fact that was 20 inches but you guys
know I'm used to wearing 28 inch hair in
32 inch hair so this is probably why I
feel short to me but for the average
person this would probably be very
perfect due to the simple fact that it's
um it's a nice it's a nice length and
it's the thickness of it is actually
nice I have to say about this week that
I couldn't say about other ones is that
the thickness of it is perfect it's not
it's not too much you know my
specifications what I like as far as
thick wigs are concerned but it's enough
for the average person who wants a wig
that looks natural and kind of comes off
as it's really nice this would be
perfect
um you can see like right here it
doesn't flow like when I do this it does
that and that's because it's kind of dry
at the bottom it doesn't just kind of
flow back into place like it should but
it does move it that's how body it's
just that I would probably have to keep
a brush on me if I was to wear it um as
you can see this top part just just not
want to lay down and no matter how hard
I brush it no matter how much water I
put on it no matter how hard I put the
Flatiron up with the curlers like it
just does not want to lay down so I
really don't know why um but like I said
it's not bad it's not a bad week cuz I
don't dislike it I'm just not crazy
about it you know and this is the first
time I think since I've been reviewing
weeks that I've had a wig that I wasn't
too that happy about where it's
something that I really couldn't just
fix you know so I think that's the only
thing I don't know if this hair was
processed to the point where I don't
even know what kind of hair this is I
just know that it just says like
celebrity so it just is this previous
human hair just not like synthetic or
anything it's human it's just um yeah I
just just Pokemon probably be like more
fo
coarse silky I would think that's what I
mean that's what I would call it uh it
just says Toki though but yeah it's not
bad at all
I just just like us always you guys
their wigs so you have to work with them
to kind of make them what you want
because what I was gonna originally do
which probably would help a lot of you
guys excuse me if you do get this week
as I was gonna cut bangs in it I'm just
gonna do like the Barbie bangs like the
real thick ones since his hair is kind
of course I mean kind of like thick um I
was just gonna cut bangs in it and I
just decided not to because I wanted to
see how I would look with a part with
this color cuz I didn't just want it to
be like a helmet but I'm probably gonna
end up cutting bangs into it and I
probably come back into an update in a
later video or whatever just kind of to
pop in and say hey so you can kind of
see it but yeah other than that that's
pretty much all I have to say about the
wig thank you to our PG show for sending
me the wig if you guys do want to try it
I would say go ahead and give it a try I
wouldn't steer you wrong but I'm just I
wanted to be honest I want you guys I
want you guys to know exactly how I feel
about it because I don't want you to buy
something or you know spend your money
on something that you would be like what
he said it was good and it wasn't you
know but it wasn't bad it's not bad at
all
you know I think looks a long deep
condition on a deep condition it for
about 40 minutes but probably if I was
keep it in like I usually do for like an
hour
or sometimes 24 hours then it makes a
world of a difference so I might
actually do that before I cut the bangs
in it cuz it might make a difference
um but yeah I'll put all the specs about
the wig below and if you have any
questions feel free to ask me and yeah I
will talk to you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
