have the time please do something
different can you do a middle part with
a lace wig please can you do some color
please
so me an RPG show decided to do
something a little bit on a different
side this time and this wig this entire
wig it's everything I you guys know how
I feel about color I like color and it's
cute and everything and it's nice and
everything but I'm not one for a lot of
color normally no so yeah they sent me
this particular wig and I'm gonna give
you the specs on the wig you guys know
if you don't know if this is your first
time welcome to my channel
so it comes with of course a brush and
it comes with a wig liner and this is
these are specs is this is hair code in
it 0:01 - as the hair color is like the
celebrity I don't know the girl is on
the picture like the celebrity girl I
don't know she's like some random
Instagram girl that they got a picture
from but I don't know so um the hair
length is 20 inches is silky it's a
hundred percent um the density is a
hundred percent medium excuse me the cap
construction is a cap three glueless cap
the cap size is a one the lace color is
a light brown use so if you buy from our
Fiji show and you don't like it then do
not cut the lace office I don't like
this week I want to send it back cuz
it's not gonna work like that comment
comes with a instructions of a lace wig
manual and it comes with this is the
paper it comes with with a little lunch
lady yet look happy to unit okay so um
this week is the ombre wig it has a
color I don't know which color this
would be but this is the color pretty
much of what it looks like or whatever
and yeah I love the color I like this
more than I like the blonde wig that I
got it was just a little too blonde but
this color is actually perfect I would
actually die one of my you parts like
this this particular color their curls
did not come like this it was straight
when I received this so I just cut a
little layer just right in here and then
curled it really quick and really fast I
just did these curls like 10 minutes ago
um oh yeah this is how it looks when you
brush through it is I figured out
something you guys remember the last
wing I did and I said I think the last
week I did was that Beyonce Bob and I
was like it had it felt dry at the ends
normally when people get wigs or weaves
or later they car wash I'm not really a
big person on co-washing because I feel
like that's just extra work that I don't
have to look I don't want to have to do
and with virgin hair I like the way it
smells when you first receive it it just
I don't know what that fresh I don't
know what it is but I love that smell or
whatever and I know my smell goes away
it's time to take your hair out so
anyway um what I did last time was that
Beyonce Bob that I had I washed it and I
could wash about washed it and it was
like a I guess they put like a film over
the wigs I don't know what purpose this
was served but it's like a film over the
wig so this particular one I did was
when I got I was like oh god it's dry
again but when I coop when I washed this
particular one as well it was like a
little film came off and then once that
came off it's nice and bouncy and flowy
like this so it could just be my mistake
or whatever I don't know it doesn't say
anything that there is you know if my
you might want to go wash it I haven't
looked in that instruction manual so in
my fade in there I just don't know um
but yeah the wig it has adjustable strap
in the back and it has three combs it
has one in the middle two on the side so
it is nice and snug it's not gonna go
anywhere I don't have any tape or glue
or whatever to keep my part down or
whatever I just have it really taunt
like it's not going anywhere I haven't
had any shutting with the Union at all
I've been wearing it on and off for the
past week and I really do like it I
haven't this is the first I think RPG
showed that wig that I've had where I
haven't had any complaints which is
really nice because it's really cool
it's 22 inches which you guys know it's
very short for
me I usually like my hair all the way
down my butt but I wanted to try
something different and kind of give you
guys an option to say well he has 20 and
22 inches and I like how 22 inches look
so it'll be the same price because
sometimes what happens is if I do a
review on any company and I have 28
inches and then you go to get 20 and you
see how much it costs to 28 inches 24
might be a little more cheaper or 22
might be a little cheaper but not that
really you know that big of a difference
so if you use cold ID 'fb TV you can get
$35 off this wig or any other week that
they have on the site where your
purchased so yeah I like this I like the
color the ombre is done very well it's
not like that blunt line of demarcation
it actually has but our nice gradient to
it which is great you know that's always
nice when it's done correctly so I like
that the hair curled easily it's flowy
it doesn't snag the density you guys
know I love 85 packs or more but I will
say this is enough hair for the average
this is a natural density okay for me I
like not natural density I like barbie
density this is definitely natural
density for the everyday person who
doesn't want a whole lot of hair on
their neck and you're hot and you know
it's a lot going on if you don't want
that or what everything this definitely
is perfect for you because it has a
beautiful natural wave you know when you
curl it it's not like you curl it for
everybody took me about 10 minutes to
pop these curls in or whatever and then
I'll just pretty much lift it alone so
yeah this is again from our PG show I
will put the okay I'm getting a little
snag up in here okay there we go
so yeah um yeah this is from our PG show
I will put the all the information for
this particular wig at the bottom and if
you're wondering how I got the curls I
just used a one inch barrel curling iron
and then I just curl it all the way
around and then brush them out and that
was pretty much it so yeah I hope you
guys enjoyed this and if you have any
she's again feel free to ask me on
Instagram or Twitter and I will be sure
to answer your step</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
