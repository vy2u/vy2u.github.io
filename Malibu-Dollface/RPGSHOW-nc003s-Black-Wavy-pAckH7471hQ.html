know but I'm trying to new setup because
I got a new light and I feel like this
would actually help you guys see the
wigs that I review in the hair that I
review a little bit better then doing it
in natural light so if I do this you can
see all the texture and it's a beautiful
wig and fellow Chucky he's here
year-round not just for October so with
no further ado this week that I'm
currently wearing and people are loving
on Instagram right now it's from our PG
show this is one of the new October arm
releases and this is a natural unit
which I love because you guys everybody
isn't into the 34 inches of the you know
long silky hair and some people actually
like natural looking hair and this
actually mimics my natural hair more so
than anything um before I blow-dry it
this was what it would look like just
like this and when I did blow-dried it
would look like my Italian yaki so I got
two weeks that look like my hair at
different stages so I'll give you guys
the specs on this particular wig and
then tell you the do's and the don'ts
and the things that I'm doing I don't
like about it so this is um a stock wig
it's a human hair wig it's wavy it says
that it's 14 inches and the style number
is NC 0 0 3 the hair color is the one
being the hair length is 20 inches now
what I think what they're trying to tell
me here but I'm not really sure about
and I think that this part is 14 and
this part is 20 I think that's what
they're trying to say because it's cut
so it's two different lengths I think so
it says the hair texture is silky non
yaki now this is I believe it was Toki
before it was processed and then it
became this curly situation because if
you look at it if you look at the curl
pattern you could tell that it was some
type of silk
and here cuz it still has some shine to
it um it says that the cap of the lace
color is a light brown the cap
construction is a cap 3 the cap size is
a 1 and of course as always if you do
not like your unit or you're not
satisfied with it or something is wrong
with it do not cut the lace off and feel
free to send it back to our PG Show
now I've had this unit for about I wanna
say like three weeks um and I posted a
picture on Instagram and people thought
that I had took my braids out and this
was my natural hair my natural hair is a
little bit longer than this but it's
about as full as this um and people were
like oh I didn't even know it was a wig
I thought it was yours so you know
everybody I'm listen you guys know I
love my Italian Yankee and I thought
more of a natural look than this I mean
then what I'm used to usually I go for
very long very bright or dark and it's
usually five bundles this is probably
the most comparable wig that I've ever
gotten from our PG show and when it came
it came just like it looked in the
picture that's pretty much what it was
cuz a lot of times in Salomon and they
you know they wrap them up and I send
them to you and they just a bowl and you
gotta figure out how to work with them
but I literally took this out the Box
put it on my head and that was it so um
it's 14 inches I think I think that's
what they're saying is 14 inches in the
bank Park Ave this was already pretty
good I didn't cut anything and then the
back part is longer this would be the 20
inch I didn't measure anything cuz it
was but this is what it looks like all
the way around
I really didn't define my part much
because I wanted it to kind of be wild
and kind of everywhere so I didn't
really try to define the part of much
but look at the texture it's really
pretty like this is super duper pretty
like I love this like you can see my cap
right here so VI on cone
so let's go um but yeah I just left my
edges out right here this is mines and
then I just kind of put it into here and
this would be the part if normally if I
were to put apart but I didn't really
want to define it like that because it
becomes like just a big mop so I just
kind of did Ivy's method and just kind
of throw it over and pulled it over and
just messy with it you know like you
know this is good because you guys don't
have a convertible right so this is the
convertible hair because if I wear this
and drive my car when I get to my
destination I will be just fine when I
wear straight here and try to do that it
is a mess I have to take a brush I have
second comb on up to the top of wanted
to see what I have I know convertible
just keep top left so I do love this you
guys I think this is one of the best
wigs I got from RPGs show now that kind
of the the pros and the cons um there's
only one con for this and the rest are
all pros because I love it it's full
lace um and you know I've cut the lace
off it wasn't hard it isn't edge isn't
it's not none of that you know they have
three combs in the front there's one
right here one right here and one right
here there's no combs in the back though
but there is an adjustable strap
I believe no there's no there's no
there's no adjustable strap um but you
could put a comb in here or coma to when
I got it you guys know it came with a
wig liner and it came with a coupon code
of $35 so this this expires on the 31st
so this inspires a halloween and it is
RPG gift this is what the code would be
when if you wanted to get $35 off this
wig or any other week that she wanted to
purchase off of the site guys know comes
with lace care instructions for you guys
through our new to wear lace wigs or
whatever and oh yeah um be yeah
back to the column the column that I did
not like about this wig was a bit of a
stink to it when I received it and I
believe that I had to do with the
processing of to get the texture so that
wasn't really a bit of that was enough
probably no I sprayed it with some
fabric softener Oh in a spray bottle and
I'm good now my hair smells like um you
know snuggle I'm good
um I would deep condition this week if I
was you guys um just kind of if you
wanted to get the smell out on a regular
but I really like this and I wanted to
show you guys what it look like when I
first received it but I will deep
condition it and I will be wearing this
wig more because it's very easy to put
on so I will be having a lot of more
videos in this one you guys know I have
a longer one from a different company
that was more silky or whatever but that
we can really stay in place when I would
walk around this if I do this it's gonna
stay like I need it to stay so that's
the good part about that like I just
fluff it around and then I'm back to
what I was when I first started the
video so that's the part about it so I
love this um let me know what you guys
think below um let me know if you guys
like the new setup um if you don't
that's fine too
this is not gonna be my only setup this
is just gonna be one if I need to do
either hair reviews or a quick review or
something but I still be using the white
backdrop so don't think that's going cuz
I need those for a living here so I will
talk to you guys later and I hope you
guys love this video and yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
