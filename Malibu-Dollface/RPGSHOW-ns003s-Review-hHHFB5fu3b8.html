we need where is the fountain as the
distance on the other side baby trying
to find the problem but if you don't
talk then I keep saw I love you friends
I will say this this wig is a by far my
favorite color that I had I don't know
exactly what this color is considered or
what it would be considered all I know
is I really do like it
so yeah it's from our PG show and I'm
gonna just say I'll back every time I
get RPGs your wig or whatever reason
these boxes seem to just get worse and
worse when I get them so yeah the box
came like this I did not do this and
they sent me a thank-you note which they
normally don't do but nice and then you
guys know the wig came in this plastic
it came with this net it came with a
brush the rpg's your brush with a wig
liner and it came with a wig instruction
you know how to take care of your late
now this is what number it is it's pound
number in s 0 0 3 - s the hair color is
like the celebrity I don't exactly know
who which celebrity had this hair on on
the site I don't really recall because
when I received the email they pretty
much told me with their new colors were
gonna be and this was pretty much a wig
that was on a mannequin so I don't know
exactly which is all I really had this
color but whoever had it shout out today
I'm still giving me a very I don't know
when I wear middle parts I just need a
Kardashian vibe from it like Chloe a
little bit of Courtney not really Kim
but you know so yeah um it's 20 inches
but you guys know I am NOT one for short
hair so this is pretty much as long as
it's gonna come cuz you guys know I
don't I like it all the way down my butt
it's really I don't know it's just
different for me to wear wigs that are
this short because I want the slang in
the back and I don't have it cuz clearly
it is a cap construction 3
it's a glueless cap it's a cap size one
it's the like innocent light brown lace
again if you don't like the wig when you
get it do not credit because you can't
return it so um this is very similar to
this particular wig that I've just
reviewed for them not too long ago it
was this one and I had a curled it the
cap construction in this is the exact
same as that one and this is what it
looks like an inside it has a
stretchable panel so let's just say you
buy a size one cap and your head is a
little bit bigger than a size 1 then the
stretchable panels on the inside will
help stretch it around your head it's
not gonna be just that so it does
stretch quite a bit before you actually
tear it but don't stretch it too much if
you've got a size 3 cap and don't get a
1 let's just say that okay don't do that
yourself don't do that to you money
don't do it's a wig
so everything is as you can see
everything is laid this is all concealer
that I put when I wore this one as you
can see this was the the wig I said she
was tried this one on the other hand
isn't that dry so I don't know
because they put a color over it that it
changed I don't not really sure but yeah
and then this one has the same one I
have one has these three combs it's the
one in the middle which is right here
and then a two on side which is right
here I never cut this piece of lace off
in the back because I don't never be
putting my hair up enough ponytails
so it really don't serve no purpose the
hair texture is really nice it's just
the same as this one it feels exactly
the same except the color part is very
assistant it matches this so it's it's
the same difference this is all one so
that's the thing so I guess they kind of
got the memo I guess I may not be the
only one that's complaining about the
dryness at the bottom of the weeks that
have color in them because I know that
it was one week that I got it might have
been one of the first couple of weeks I
got from RPG show they um they were
really good and but they did have any
color in them they were just like black
are off
1b are just like a natural color they
were not on great wigs so since the
whole I'm rate thing is you know hot
right now of course most of the wigs
that they're stocking up on or you know
colorful wigs that are whatever so yeah
I like this I would dye my entire head
this color not my head my weave color
here but I don't even know what color
this would be this is like a cherry cola
rinsed but it's kind of like pink but
it's kind of like down at the bottom
that you think this color is and if you
like it or not I do like it RBG show did
a really good job with this when I've
never seen it though it didn't have
these layers in it like in the front all
of this that's in the front right here
all of this I did it was just you know
it was straight it was just straight I
just put some light layers in it the
density is just a hundred percent
density and that's just our TV show
stock lens if you want them thicker or
you want them longer you have to wait
and get them custom-made because they
don't stock their wigs and adjust like
150 density or hundred into what how
about I think this is 100% density let
me make sure it is not saying no but I
know most RPGs show wigs are 100%
density I don't really think this is 120
because it's not that full you know it's
it's full but it's not that full so I
know for a fact that I know what 150
density feels like and I know what 125th
and insidee feels like and that's not
what this feels like
this is definitely a natural density you
know this is not five packs of hair
which I'm kind of getting used to the
natural look you know like okay
you're done you know you don't have to
worry about like it's flat so yeah I do
like this though and I love this color I
don't know what color this is though so
RPG show can you tell me what color this
is or what color you use cuz I want this
I would so do this to my some of my
virgin hair I would so do this later but
yeah if you like this unit let me know
and down below and I will put all the
information about it down below and it
should be it should have flashed
somewhere across your screen and I hope
you guys have a wonderful day
again thank you to our PG show for this
beautiful wig as well as this one
so yeah let me know what you think and I
will see you guys later and happy 4th of
July
