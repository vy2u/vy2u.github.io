RPG show Lourdes red League that I wore
I want to say I'm probably about a
couple weeks ago I did a review for this
particular wing and I just wanted to
come back to let you guys know how it's
been holding up when I originally did
the review I had a middle part and I'm
now switched it from a middle part to a
side part and the only thing I did was
make the weight crooked that's pretty
much it I just this is so this is still
the middle part I just hit it on the
side am I um I've worn this week
probably about a total of probably about
six or seven times since that review and
I shampoo this hair I want to say about
twice since and it is yet to give me any
problems
it goes through I'm not getting any
tangles and other issues no problems it
has not shed it once which it's a little
rarity because with RPG show wigs um I
never get much chatting but I do usually
after a couple of watches you know you
keep coming West anyway you get like a
couple of trends with this one I don't
know why nor do I cater but I'm happy
that it's not Chevy so that's the
distinct honor is still is it was when I
originally reviewed it and our shampoo -
twice so and then stripped of color or
anything still so it wasn't on I got it
which I love and it still fits snug it's
not like sometimes when you get wings I
will be honest and something you get
wings they do be all if you wear them so
long just but like they start to stretch
out and then eight
a little bit but when you first get up
you're gonna be snug but it's still snug
though it it fits my head a bit better
sometimes when you get them they do be a
little tight you know cuz you trying to
make it and I wear a small cap
so sometimes everybody's small cap
sometimes isn't the same but yeah I
haven't had an issue with this it's
still holding up like it should it's
still still kia straight color still
vibrant so eight plus plus RPG show you
guys have definitely had a big
turnaround with the color situation and
all of that so I hope you guys enjoyed
this a little update if you guys like
this let me know I don't always update
my wigs because I only reason why I
usually will come back about a wig and
say something as if it was something bad
like this week on me it matted up
on me but I've yet to have such look
what's a bad look in our department
thank God so yeah everything is still as
it should be
just still holding up and I hope you
enjoyed this and I put the link to this
week um below as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
