asymmetrical ombre my green hombre RPG
show I'm just saying just as a
disclaimer this hair is not really a
specialist because I made the wig rookie
so now that the ombre goes like this
instead of going like this which I
actually like better than just the
straight-across you kind of give it a
little bit of spunk and also just as a
disclaimer as well I'm sure it's gonna
look like one side is longer that this
side is shorter than this side but
that's only because it's crooked so
that's why and I didn't really notice
that until after I positioned it ending
I'm a pardon everything in place that we
use I'm not going to change them okay so
this is you guys know what I received
this is something new that I have not
seen from our TV show which is like a
brochure and it has some people that are
known here and some people that I don't
I know mashanda and pretty girl Angie
here on the front and then I also know
look here and Shonda in the inside
so yeah shout out to them I don't see
myself up in here but you know that's
cool
but anyway um when I received it it came
with the this wig cap slash liner
really
RBG show his hair here's a note you just
started in me it's Han way caps they
look like my scalp and we'll be good cuz
these don't ever get used and then I
just paddle up and then I end up having
fun way it came with an instruction
manual as you guys know for your ladies
this particular unit is in s0 0 for s
the hair length is 20 inches the hair
color the same as a picture emerald so
same rule green
it's a silky texture a cap 1 cap
construction is a 3 the lace color is a
light brown and remember whenever
ordering wigs from RPG show if you do
not like the wig when you receive it do
not cut the lace off if you would like
to return hang out and then also they
sent me this gift card and it says use
coupon code
RPG gift and expires 1031 2014 and you
will receive other two five dollars off
of yours oh and as well as the RPG show
the RPG show brush that they usually
give you I don't think I've ever not
received one D so I got like localities
so yeah this particular unit is a full
ace unit and then it also has lace in
the back it has two columns on the side
and then has a stretchable panel in the
back this particular unit itself I
wasn't too short on because this is part
of their newer collection and I'm like
still want to try something I don't know
maybe I did have a green install but I'm
just want to try it out to kind of see
one thing that I'm very proud of RPG
show 4 is listening to a lot of us
reviewers who have said that when we got
ombre color that it was dry because this
hair is so not dry it matches the time
so they definitely uh they're listening
to suggestions about how to improve
quality of their wigs and things of that
nature so I'm very happy about this as
well because you guys know a few of my
weeks that I got they were dry and I
didn't I really didn't like them but
yeah the last two I got this one in the
red one actually were very well
constructed which usually they are well
they always are and they didn't have no
dryness at the bottom so it was easier
to cut everything ladies like you're
supposed to you know you don't have
those when hair is over-processed
to try to style it it's like trying to
fit an elephant into the back of a
beetle it's just not gonna happen it's
just gonna look stupid
so I'm actually excited about this I did
the method if you guys are interested in
how I got my wig to lay down and all
that good stuff I will put the link to
that video below but yeah the the unit
itself is very nice I will say it's very
nice I can't I don't have any complaints
about it one thing I won't complain I do
have though is that when I was cutting
the lace off a bit like the the extra
laces in the front you have to cut off
it was like snags and holes and I don't
know I'll take a picture the picture
should be somewhere within this video
but yeah it wasn't in the cap of the
actual it was just around the front so I
don't know if maybe it got snagged on
something I don't know I'm not for sure
but when I see lace with holes in it
it's named after red holes that's kind
of something like problem so yeah our
pre-show kind of watch out for that
because customers do not wanna get their
wigs with snags and holes and
things very trim but beside that yeah I
like the hair I can't say anything bad
about it I really do like this color and
I'm appreciating the fact that this they
are allowing they're sticking with the
trends that's going on now I will say
there have been other companies that are
popping up but a lot of silver gray hair
and I gotta take sorry about that
but um yeah I like how there's thinking
with the trends of what's going on and
and all of that good stuff
I would I would love this if it was
about I was I mean I love the hair as is
but I would have really I fell in love
probably if this was an ombre bob at it
like an asymmetrical bob like this would
have been really cute in this color with
the darker roots or some Browns or
something like that this is what I've
been really cute so I love it I can't
say anything bad about it besides the
little the lace issue but besides that
yeah it comes through there's just no
snags
I just flat ironed it when I got it
lightly I didn't have to do no major
this to it at all yeah I'm using it
comes right through I did put some
product in it though I put some some
granny fruity super hold to get this to
lay down and then I also use my turn it
up spray to Flatiron it is a heat
protectant and then I used to say and
then I put some argan oil on it so
that's why I like some some places it
doesn't look greasy but has like a
weight to it and I stood up but the
argan oil only so that it could lay down
and what happened
or anything but yeah if you like this
unit let me know it's very mermaid it's
not so great it's not like this is one
of those wigs that you can wear to a
party and people all your hair looks
beautiful now somebody look wretched you
know it's not the wretched green or the
wretched red you know it's more of a
more of a calm down
conservative color you still have a
little pop of color some spunk but it's
not crazy you know so yeah if you like
this let me know you don't let me know
but be respectful and check my Instagram
at Malibu doll face as well as their
Instagram at RPG show wigs always argue
it'll be down below okay just don't give
me too long I'm gonna hurt my brain
which I'm good so yeah again all right
RPG show calm is where this wig is from
and I'll put the link to this wig below
and I will talk to y'all next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
