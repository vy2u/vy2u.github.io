somebody like me hello ah okay
so hi guys Lissette was it was it was
good so I'm here of course to talk about
Al a wig okay
laid wig know that um and this week is
actually I did not make this week and it
feels good and I had to slave and do all
that sewing cuz it's from RPG show okay
now let me just tell ya it's been a
while since me and RPG show have hooked
up and did the damn thing but they got
new boxing number days to have like
these bugs they wasn't it sturdy like
this is like some cardboard so I'll tell
you what came in the box because things
have changed is the last time y'all see
me but our position week so you're not
even upgrade it on the home so it came
with the lunch lady net that just failed
it came with my information so this is
what it is so I'll give you all of the
info here it says dramatic a red Bob
player is not red um it says red by 180
density Oh fool this week is very full
okay
so you guys know in the past my RPGs
always have been the wigs that I've had
the most issue with because of the
fullness well it looks like they just
they went ahead and put like two more
bundles in because I'm loving this it's
real full especially for it to be such a
blunt cut if you have a blunt cut and
it's really thin it shows so as you can
see I don't okay my hair color is a 1b
which is an off black so it's definitely
um not a one
I could tell that it's not a one which I
love this cut though I'm really liking
this
um the hair length is 12 inches I have a
silky texture my lace color is a light
brown which I have
is my concealer yeah um the cap
construction is a four which is a lace
front wig so you guys know usually a
lace front stops right here but I went
ahead and cheated it all the way
Kardashian back so they didn't upgrade
it on the show they got like dust bags
for the wigs now so my wig actually came
in this dust bag and it came with two of
these good old stocking caps which I am
currently wearing one so these that
they've been sitting for years which I
absolutely love and they sent a conceit
is hold on oh it's nice so they sent an
actual our missus ear to ear tab um
fixing lace tightly onto the head so
what they do is they give you um all of
these instructions now on how to
properly put your wig on but it also
came with an elastic band so you wanted
to go ahead and sew it as you don't feel
like the adjustable strap that's in the
back gives you enough um tightness they
gave you one which i think is really toe
job RBG shows you listening this stuff
which other companies were taking out
they came with a classic RPG show wooden
brush Oh Lord my earring Oh God
and then it came with a RPG Show
magazine that has a lot of the gurus
that you are familiar with in the inside
okay so to the actual wig um I will say
off rip this is the best RPG show wink
that I've had besides you know my
plastic a middle part one that I used to
wear like ever forever um yeah
this wig is so comfortable it fits my
face great I love the blunt cut the hair
texture is nice I haven't got any bad
shedding it was easy I already hat came
with a pre-existing part in it which I
absolutely love because I know how I am
I hate to have to part my hair so if you
already put it in there after you don't
pluck the hairs in it it's great it's
even all the way around so and it's very
full
like very full and it's for it to be 12
inches you would think they gonna skimp
out Nikon do some other BS but no it's
really really nice I love this hair like
this now this is one of those um bobs
that you just pretty much wear wherever
you can go to work in it you can go to
the club in it you can go to Magic
Mountain it just make sure you put your
adjustable strap and your elastic band
in it um you can pretty much go anywhere
and this look will work it's very
versatile for everybody you can dress it
up you can dress it down when I was
getting dressed I was trying to figure
out like what could I wear to compliment
the hair so this particular jacket that
I have on which is from homage holders
and they actually are the ones who did
my BMW and I think my Ferrari jacket is
one I think my rolls worth jacket so
it's this sequence ok Los Angeles um
entire situation with a homage shoulders
on the back so I just thought that it
was such outstanding piece why not do
this with this nice blunt cut in some
big oh I gotta load up so I really do
enjoy this and I think for most of you
guys who are you just want something
subtle but you still want to weigh cause
you want a protective style I think this
is great um they did a great job for
this particular look I believe they're
working with Anthony cuts I think this
is named um he's like all over Instagram
and I believe that this is one of his
styles that I guess they suggested or
did for them so I love the fact that
they're actually taking advice from
people or beauty gurus or hair gurus
online because pretty much we make the
trends and then everybody pretty much
follows so as a company is smart that
they're like okay so what's going on
like what are what is everybody wearing
right now so the blunt cut is definitely
um one of my favorite favorite pretty
much on everybody it just works and it
pretty much fits everybody's face shape
for the most part so you know a long
face if you have there's more rounder
face your face shaped like mines we got
like more of a jawline it's still friend
your face perfectly
works I don't have any down nothing bad
about this wig which is very rare with
me an RPG show I usually have something
to say but I really don't I really do
genuinely thoroughly enjoy this I want
to give RPG show some claps um because
this is actually a really good well made
full density wig okay and then when I
didn't receive it though it had a bit
because it was in the bag so I had like
a slight of a like a wave or curl I mean
it had a slight it wasn't bone straight
like it was because they send me a
picture after it was done and of course
when you ship you have to put it in a
box they put it in the bag so I just had
to go ahead and flat iron it so I flat
ironed it with like a bump in it and
then I let it sit overnight and then I
let it fall so it fell into this nice
bump but it's not crazy you know I don't
want to look like because this could
easily turn this could easily turn into
your Grandmama's wig you know I'm saying
if you bump it my sister said it looked
like a chick I forgot what her name is
but the little short chick from The
Incredibles um with the glasses in in
the bangs
she said wedding before I actually did
something to it that's what it reminded
her of so yeah if you guys are
interested make sure you guys um click
the links below for reference because
somebody's gonna ask it's a the dramatic
Bob this is a really um and then it is
b.o.b 0 0 8 - s and my lace color is a
light brown and my cap is a 4 so they
remember this is a lace front it is not
a full lace wig however if you do go
ahead and try to cheat um cheat it with
some concealer so oh good job next boom
