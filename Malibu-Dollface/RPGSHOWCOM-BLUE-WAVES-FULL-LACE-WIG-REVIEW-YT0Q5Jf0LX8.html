like 70s right now um so to my wig this
week is from RPG show as I'm sure you
guys read above and this wig is part of
their Black Friday sale people okay
which is currently going on from the
18th to the 28th of this month so if you
are interested after I'll do this then
head over there because you can save up
to $80 if you use coat black 5 so yeah
if you interested head over there now so
this particular unit is called this is
the blue waves touched by Tim wig this
is like a royal not so royal blue I
don't know what to call this particular
blue but it's really right my length is
18 inches which we'll talk about in a
second texture is silky my lace color
was a light brown my way cap color which
is the back piece that's a medium brown
and it says that this is a cap B which
is the lace front wig but this is a lot
of fun which I'm not complaining about
okay so I got a message from RPG show
and they was like you know we have this
new way coming out we want to know if
you were interested in reviewing it they
sent me a picture and I love the picture
that they sent it was a nice beautiful
like short it was well it was 18 or
could have been a bit longer I don't
recall and I said okay I'll do that one
that's fine I like the color I like the
combination I'm sure that you guys are
interested in some pre colored pre
treated hair that you guys want to do
you know so when we started talking
about the shipment of the wig then
things got a little dicey because I was
like I wanted something at least like 20
I'm not used to wearing here this short
people like at all so
this was a little new for me um and once
I got the wig I took it out the box and
I will be honest I was not in love with
it when I took out the Box I was just
kind of like oh no and then the more I
play with it the more I kind of got to
know it the color is beautiful
and as you guys can see it curls
beautiful the only thing that I didn't
like was the fact that in here there are
is the colors not as consistent as I
would have liked it to be it is nice but
it's definitely not consistent because
it doesn't have it doesn't have a line
of become demarcation with the color but
it is kind of abrupt it's not like that
smooth transition that you are used to
when you have color treated hair it is
it has more of the like the panel look
if you guys know anything about color
like that hot panels are that's kind of
how it looks um just straight down so
this is what I decided to do with it
originally I did in Middle Park as I
know I do a lot of side parts because
y'all know that's my favorite and um I
decided to do a middle part so I went
ahead and did that I went ahead and
bleach the knots on this particular unit
so this can match my skin tone a little
bit better and just because I don't I
don't want the knots and then I went
ahead and curled it a curl I will say
this is like the best wig that I've
curled in quite some time
because this has stayed these curls have
been in his hair for about two days and
I didn't wear them they were just really
sitting but as you can see they're still
quite fluffy for two-day-old curls and I
went ahead originally it was just like
kind of the classic Kim K look where it
was just throw the waves but because it
is so short um I didn't really too much
care for how it looked this shy looked
like a step for wife and I was not
feeling that so I was about to just kind
of be a little bit defeated with this
and say hey this is that's all I could
do and then I just seen a picture of my
girl Barbie on Instagram and she had the
little slick pieces here behind her ear
in the front and then the rest are here
was like this in the back and I thought
it was extremely cute so obvious to do
it and it worked
so my experience does
is when I did go ahead and bleach the
knots and of course you have to wash
your condition the color didn't bleed
which I was very happy about it did not
believe because you guys know when you
get a lot of pre treated waste I usually
smell a lot like died rather be adore
Manic Panic whatever it smells crazy and
it just had no smell at all what you
guys know in the past I've had a little
issues with my are positional wigs
smelling very pungent when I've got them
but this one didn't smell at all and
then I didn't believe which I was happy
about when I cut it the density of this
wig which I'll see if they play in here
I don't recall yeah it doesn't say what
the density of this wig is I had to cut
it so because of course when you do the
the Kim K you have to cut your top
layers so this all right here was cut
here in the front all this right here
this was cut and I steal my hair still
very full which I'm loving all of this
isn't pulled forward and I really do I
like this I don't love it just because
blue isn't this shade of blue isn't
exactly my favorite shade of blue on
myself but I will say that it curled the
curls are gorgeous light so they have
the black the black the black mixed in
it which is beautiful and yeah it has a
very nice silky texture to it it was
easy to it's easy to brush as you can
see it's very bouncy I did like to I
used a nice amount of hairspray just
because I like my hair to last so that
could be why these curls are still
popping after so many days and I used I
use i forgot what hairspray I'm using as
of right now but I just used that I
washed and conditioned it and the color
is still very rich this is the color
that is posted on their site it didn't
like get extra green cuz you know it's
real quick you know colors real quick to
do they let it be a little bit you end
up with a whole bunch of green hair and
everybody I'm trying to be cleese okay
so I don't know I'm like I will give
okay so
grading period I will give RPG show a
nice nine and a half for this only
because I don't like the color
transition at the top that's what I'm
not like see how it's
see the color is kind of it's kind of
abrupt it's there like you know it has
it in there but it's still it's not the
transition isn't as I would like it to
be but it's not it's not terrible you
know I do like this style a whole lot I
do think that the wig density shout-out
to our PG show for this wig density of
him because had I tried this two years
ago this would have been a complete and
utter fail but they have definitely
upgraded their density especially
because I cut a lot off of this wig here
in the front for sure and I still have a
nice amount of hair you guys know when
your hair is very thin and you curl it
you look like it's rough okay I'm just
gonna it's rough people oh so yeah I
like this if you guys are interested in
the color make sure you guys hit the
links below or anything I would have
liked if they just what I gave me a
longer wig I do not like eighteen inches
of anything okay you're practically bald
and that's how I feel like I'm just I'm
personally not the guru that you guys go
to for the short hair I am NOT I am 40
inches in longer type of person that's
just how I've always been I think that's
how always will be I'm gonna be a old
man and wigs dragging the floor but if
this is you know more of your season
anymore of your liking because you are
in a more of a professional environment
or you just happen to be a person who
just really likes hair that is more
manageable then this will definitely be
more your C's remember use cold black
five who save $80 on your purchase of
any wig right now on our PG show site
shouts RPG show for really lacing me up
with some great wigs this year I will
say that I'm very happy with the
collection that I have from them versus
I've had in past years but they have
definitely listened and an upgraded like
they're supposed to so I hope you guys
enjoyed this I will catch you guys in my
next one
okay I'm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
