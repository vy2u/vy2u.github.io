all right
this slow puppy right here is popping
okay so this is from I'm sure you guys
are reading the title already but this
is from our PG show and as you guys can
see they've got new packaging okay so
this is one of their new 200 density
wigs you guys know I love RPG show but
my main issue that I've always had with
them is that it was the fullness of
their wigs
well they fixed the problem guys and um
I will say this this is so me it looks
like I literally just took my braids out
and flat ironed and pressed my hair and
this is what I meant by when I said it
can be short it just has to be fuller
because the shorter the hair the fuller
it needs to be so it could look more
natural when it comes down to wigs now
this is a 14 inch unit so this unit is
actually very natural I I was thinking
like oh no I feel about a 14 but I was
thinking more like a 16 but oh this this
works this definitely works the part
when I received it the part was like
from here to about here and then I long
gated it to here this is actually not a
full lace wig this is actually a lace
front wig okay and I think people get
this a little misconstrued and they
don't know the difference between a lace
wig and a lace front so the difference
is it's my RPG show unit that I just are
reviewed I think like a week ago or
something like that and this one is a
full lace wig so this is what the
partying look like and then when we go
to the back of it you can see like right
here you can still see there is still
lace here when you go all the way back
here to the back of the head they're
still lace all right here when you go
back to the nape of the neck
there is still lace all back here okay
so this is what that's what a four lace
wig is a lace front is and now here's my
purple wig but this is a lace front
currently like the one that I'm
currently wearing stop what that means
is you see the parting in this was not
very much it was only this compared to
this this is a big difference okay and
then because everything stops here now I
just showed you guys how a full lace
looks at when you pull this in the back
all of this has trucks in the back okay
so all of this is the lace front because
in the very front of this there is lace
see all of this all of that is what it
looks like but all of that stops when
you get to here and then the rest is
just tracks so that's usually what the
difference is between the two so I'm
currently wearing the second one I
showed you so there are tracks here in
the back and I think don't quote me but
what I think they did to make these
fuller as they add it just more tracks
because it probably is cheaper to
construct the way with more tracks in
the back to give you more density then
it would be to take a full lace wig and
then put twice the amount of hair in it
because it's going to be twice the
amount of time and twice even out of
work so that's my only thing is that if
it's gonna I don't really care which one
it is as long as I can part my hair in
the front and make it as look as natural
as I can then I don't mind having the
tracks in the back because I'm not one
for parting my hair all the way down the
back I could but I just haven't tendency
not to do that and especially when it
comes down to lace the issue that
sometimes we tend to have with it is a
simple fact that it doesn't always look
the most natural so what I did was I
took my Anasazi a Beverly Hills contour
kit I have the one the medium one cream
and it's not the first lightest color
but it's the second lightest color I
used on my part because if you use too
much of a light concealer like but the
color I the color you do your owner eyes
with like if you do contour and
highlight use that in your part don't
use this it should be the second leg
Palli not the lightest one in the
palette and let's just being dramatic
which makeup yeah it makes it look like
it's a little bit dark I'm in a little
bit lighter than my face but I don't
want it to look like cake batter and
then people just be kind of looking at
my part and that's kind of just how you
go ahead real quick it can disguise the
knots so you can't really see so I'll
get a close-up on my part so you can see
and this is what it looks like with the
concealer in it and I only put the
concealer underneath it and I put a
little literally like Pat it in on the
top don't start drawing it in because
this is gonna start looking real crazy
well yeah I will say this unit hasn't
given me any issues no shading no loose
tracks the lace hasn't tor or it's very
soft
it lays to my head very flush so it's
very flat I give this a 110 percent
RBG show I appreciate the efforts
because they are listening to the
consumers and its reviewers because
again if I don't like something I'm not
gonna tell y'all that I love it I could
love a wig and hate the density and the
density can make the ward of a
difference in the type of hair and how
it looks because again if it is
shortened like this it needs to have a
little bit more body to it and I get you
want it to look natural this is natural
enough you know it's not super duper
full but it ain't SuperDuper thin
neither it fits to my head perfectly I
got a you know some fresh braid so
everything laying real flat right now so
yeah I mean I there's nothing else good
I can say about this but they did an
awesome job and you guys know Black
Friday is right around the corner so if
I was y'all I would definitely um keep
checking her Instagram home and I'll put
all the information to this week below
if you guys are interested and before I
go I want to give you out of Speck's
real quick this is a 200 density lace
front wig not in lace wig there is a
difference so keep that in mind the SKU
number for this is LS 0 0 1 - s the hair
color is a natural hair color so it
actually is my this
her color is what it is though mama here
30 this is 14 inches so again this is
very natural
I think the 14 the stock would come in
14 I think anything longer you have to
wait for them to make it and then get
shipped to you but 14 and I'll remind
you I never say this in videos I always
but I am 5 foot 4 so keep that in mind
and I don't have boobs so keep in mind
if you do have boobs
it's probably gonna be like this when
you get it so yeah I'm not tall by a
long shot my hair the hair texture is a
silky texture and it is very true to
silky hair the only difference is is not
overly silky it's not that synthetic I
could tell you got on some hair that's
not your origin hair it actually looks
very natural and it looks like I just
got a nice present Flatiron and got back
the cap construction is a cap
construction number 4 which is
considerably less in their stock of
pounds of information it is the lace
front wig cap and my cap size is another
one which is a cap size small and again
if you are not satisfied with your wig
make sure it's not cut the lace off of
it ok this is like when you buy clothes
and you're not really satisfied with it
you just didn't believe don't take the
tag off we that's like a known thing
don't exactly cuz I'm not gonna take it
back because clearly it's been worn so
if you try it on you don't like it or
it's not your length or something ain't
fitting right just put it back in the
box and ship it back to them but do not
cut that legs off so I will catch you
guys in the next one and I hope you guys
really enjoyed this one and I will see
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
