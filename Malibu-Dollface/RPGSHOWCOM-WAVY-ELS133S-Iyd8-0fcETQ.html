got my new one coming so I'm my last lo
peace y'all
okay so this wig this nice curly Spanish
situation
it's from our PG show check these boxes
though okay
very sturdy all right so I'm gonna get
into the specs of this wig and how I
applied this puppet and look like it's
growing out my foot
alright so you guys know when you get
wigs they come usually in here which is
like a wig dust bag which are good and
then it came with the of course my
favorites which are these way caps and
it came with two I have one left and I
have one on it came with of the RPG show
it's like a magazine that has a lot of
gurus that I will do for them and
personal photos and stuff and it came
with the piece that goes in between with
the lunch line it and their brush okay
so since I don't remember the specs to
this way at all
yeah my legs alright so this is a stock
full ace human hair wig this is a wavy
wig it is in SKU number II ls1 33 - s so
pretty much this wig is already ready to
be shipped out you don't have the way
for them to construct it or anything
like that when you get yours it's your
home or rotate my hair color is a1 hence
why my hair is so dark um that's all I'm
like Isis very Spanish very Cuban a very
Dominican it's very very dark my hair
length is a 20 inch my hair texture is a
silky non yaki my lace color is a light
brown which always requests because it
goes the best
whiskey my cap instruction is a cap a
which is a glueless lace cap my cap size
is a 1 okay oh no you guys are wondering
how the hell or is your wick sitting so
nice and I don't have any glue um any
tape and I do not have a adjustable
strap um but I don't even think this
wick comes with an adjustable strap it
doesn't it comes with a piece of lace in
the back unless you want to UM focus
puppy up in a ponytail you can do that
as well and it came it comes with one
comb too it doesn't have any on the side
but that becomes a one in a back that
will keep my wig down so I'll have no
flaps coming up so you guys are probably
wondering how did I apply my wig easy I
just simply used deals which is the got
to be glued Ultra glued and this is the
invisible styling gel I'm you guys know
I've used this before but I've never
used it uh to keep my wigs down but this
works so you pretty much take this and
then you take the sides of where your
wig is so I have no hair out right now
like literally none of this is mine
probably this piece but none of this
none of this all is coming from the
scalp none of this none of this none of
this is mines okay so what I did was I
went ahead and I bleached my nuts
on the wig so because the wig is divided
up in two parts there is the stretchable
odd cap in the back and then there's the
lace that stops probably halfway I
bleached just the lace in the front
because I knew that I needed that to
look as natural as possible I went ahead
and plucked it so there is going to be
when you receive this week there's going
to be a very big line of demarcation
that goes from ear to ear on the tabs so
these do come with your tabs um for each
side so pretty much what I did was I
took the jail okay there you go
I took the jail and I put it around my
entire hairline I took a blow dryer and
I pressed the lace against my scalp and
put the ball dryer when it dries it
pretty much fuses to your face um the
great thing about this is that it's
harmless to your hair and your skin so
when I'm able to take this off it's just
pops right off and
the great thing about this is that we
use laser glue after a while your wig is
no longer gonna be good so if you
finally made a wig or you finally
brought a wig and got a legging it's
great and or it looks like this and you
love it but then you're gluing it down
are you taping it down eventually that
lace is gonna start to roll up its gonna
start to tear and all the elements
whether it be water or whatever it's
going to start to break and it's just
not going to look it's going to tear and
look nasty so the great thing about this
is if you take a simple q-tip and you
wipe the excess glue off after you take
remove your unit and you're good it was
that simple so this is what my hair
looks like after it went been washed and
kawatche because of course after I
bleached it I had to wash it and it kept
it this Jewish now I didn't put anything
in it after I did I just left it like it
is so this has no product in it
whatsoever so after I went ahead and
washed it um ate pretty much all the way
pattern came back to it so to make it a
little bit bigger I just took my hand
and just ran my fingers through like
this which will start to make it look
big and unruly and you're going to get a
little snag here because again this is
like earlier that's kind of like wait
it's wavy um so you know you're going to
get those snags here and there here and
there but it's nothing that I'm getting
stuck in where I got to take my hand out
no it does give me a very nice natural
this is my natural hair hair pattern
look this arm look definitely gives me
um Jennifer Freeman from my wife and
kids when you got served this is what
her hair pattern usually looked like on
the show sometimes it was a little bit
tighter sometimes a little bit looser
just depending on how she was feeling or
what they was going for yeah it came out
really really really nice and the thing
that I love the most about this unit is
that rzg show got on the bandwagon when
it came to the density because it looks
amazing okay so this is the natural
density of the hair which they did not
post what the density of this wig was on
this card so the link below if you guys
go um you probably can and may it
possibly be there what the density of
this wig is but it is very realistic
you know it's not fake it's not too
thick um it's very much realistic for
the average person so I just put on some
sweats a little cute Mickey Mouse that I
got from forever 21 some nice red
lipstick and I said oh here we go just I
just wanted a lounge look I wanted
something that I could you could picture
yourself running to the store faces be
your hairs popping but you still look
not so made-up you know throw in some
earrings call it a day
so all those things that I just
mentioned are the great pros about this
wig and there's one major con that I did
not like when I got my wig it smelled
like the frito-lay factory it smelled
terrible and the Box smell bad the bag
smell bad everything that encompasses
the wig smelled terrible so I did what I
usually do which a lot people ask me
about when hair stinks or just doesn't
smell good but it's still nice hair just
whatever they did whatever process they
use the chemical to process this hair to
be like this whatever they did they
either didn't let it dry or they didn't
rinse it right or whatever um but it
just it was putrid it had my entire
kitchen stinking because it smelled like
bad feet it smell like bum toes so what
I did was I went ahead and I washed it I
conditioned it and then I used some
downy fabric softener and I put it um
probably put it like it in a little bowl
and then I just let it sit for about 30
minutes then you take it and then you go
ahead and rinse it I rinsed it really
good because you don't want any of that
left in your weight and now my wig it
smells great it smells like fresh hair
so that was my only con about this RPG
show the smells guys we got to get that
we don't got the lace together we don't
got the density together let's get the
smell I get y'all trying to pump out
these wigs but it's really hard
especially for somebody who does not
know that fabric softener will work or
if a lot of times especially because the
hair is wavy some people will over wash
it and it'll dry out because of the
smell and if you
like what my hair was bad my wig was bad
and it's like no I probably was actually
really good at just whatever that smell
was it took you forever to get out so
fabric softener people works fabuloso
works just make sure you rinse it out
very very very well and make sure that
you put a conditioning agent in it
together so that whatever you're using
which is usually a household product for
dirt and laundry
it doesn't even if it says it's
conditioning make sure you condition too
so there is no possible way you can dry
out your unit or your bundles out so I
will give our PG show for this
particular wig I will give them a 9.5
because of the smell so if you guys are
interested in this little puppy and I'll
do a tutorial on how I actually do this
with the Goss to be glued so that it
won't move and I can go do a back flip
bonus piece and then I'll in that
particular video I'll do a tutorial on
the plucking as well after I bleach it
so you guys can see exactly what I mean
so the method I use for my frontals is
the same mint that I use for this the
only difference was um it's a full wig
so I can party from here all the way to
the back of my head versus my fronts
will stop in about right here so if you
guys are interested again put the click

guys hmm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
