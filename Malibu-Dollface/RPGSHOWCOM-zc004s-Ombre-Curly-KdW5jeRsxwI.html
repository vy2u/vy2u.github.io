sweet to nobody alright guys so it's
been a while since I've had some really
tight curly hair like such um close oh
because it looks amazingly beautiful and
this comes from our peachy show and I
know you guys look like it it's been
forever since you have brought us in our
position week and you are very correct
about that um it's just been a while and
I have a lot of my legs that I still
wear from RPG show I just hadn't review
for them in a while I've been kind of
preoccupied with a lot of other things
so I hadn't got around to it but this
wig y'all let me just get up closer it's
so big umm so I'm gonna get to the specs
and I'm gonna give you really what I
love about this um and I think I'm kind
of more excited about this than I have
been in a long time because I had to
make it you know maybe that's what it is
so we're gonna get to the specs of this
and you know the co-washing just all the
regular stuff we get to it so this is a
stock full lace curly wig and it is an
ombre unit so I'm sure you guys can tell
here it's probably like a 1b and then
down here there's not like a for I want
to say so to the specs and since I can't
remember to step off cam are we gonna
read off my phone this is a stock I'm
break early full lace wig
it is queue numbers ec 0 0 4 - s this is
the same color as the picture so when I
received when I got the picture for this
they actually sent me a example wig and
then they actually made this one for me
the one that I did see which I'll put a
picture of this right here this one had
a little more relaxed it wasn't as big
as this one but you guys know I love the
bigger the thicker the better it is 20
inches long which is pretty good because
I like my big hair big but I feel like
this is enough cuz I think if it was any
bigger I will kind of be drowning in it
my lace color is always in forever al
Abraham my cap construction is a cat 3
number 3 which is a glueless cap so that
means that I can do this see and this is
a cap size number 1 so that would be
considered a small now it says if the
hair texture this is silky but clearly
has been some type of process to give it
this nice natural curl this balance um I
did Co wash this and then I let it air
dry and when this if I would have let it
air dry and kind of lift the little
product in it then it would have been
longer and heavier Oh once I let it dry
but I let it dry on a mannequin head
upside down so yeah it's giving me this
nice you know I feel like I feel like
Rachel true who played on the craft she
was the black girl with the big hair and
then she was also on half and half with
essence Atkins on UPN this is definitely
giving me her natural hair and yeah I
love this wig I am obsessed with this
because I do like the fact that it is
very easy they've done all the work for
you you know only have to do is just go
wash it I co wash it with I usually use
these together which is my Giovanni
shampooing conditioner but I just Co
washed it with this particular one which
is the triple tea tree treatment and
then they have the little thing on the
back for like the deep conditioning in
the moisture these aren't really good
brands especially it's for your hair and
your extensions this brand is to me the
one of the best I'm loving the color I
was thinking about putting the color
over it but I do like it in this natural
state because I feel like this color
like I would get my real hair not okay I
would get my real long weave this
particular Brown I like think this is
just just enough cuz for my distance my
hair just looks black but when you get
up on it
always a beautiful and they did a great
job with the ombre like they did a good
job you see ok now this angle right here
is giving you all the realness and
deliciousness that this is hair right
now okay it was very easy to co-wash I
didn't lose any hair
I lost probably about that much hair
when I was brushing through it cuz I use
a big paddle brush and a ho bitch
conditioner um but I just kind of wanted
to see if the color was gonna bleed a
little bit if it was gonna get a little
bit brittle if it was gonna be anything
that was different than what it was when
I received and it's great and I see
because it's been a while since I have
they got any wig from RPG show and it
seems as if they are listening because
you guys know years ago when I was when
I started reviewing here the one issue I
would have every RPG showed that wig
that I would get it was either too thin
and if it had color in it it was dry
this has texture in it color and it's
still luscious so I like the fact that
it seems as if they're listening to the
customers and the reviewers like y'all
we need to do this and I was also
informed that they are starting to
produce wigs that are 300 density as
well I don't know if I'm gonna stay on
it but they don't meet it
I mean they know how I love the big
thick ignorant hair so they was like you
know we know you love this and you know
a lot of people have requested their
song get 300 density I would love to see
what that looks like on me but this
where butch I believe is only a hundred
density but it's really nice it's very
it's not heavy either cuz you know I
have another wig that I made and it's
pretty heavy
it made me high but I loved it but it
made me how this one is actually very
cool it's very Airy it doesn't feel like
I have a lot of hair it moves you know
RBG sure y'all did that I'm gonna give
y'all a nice tin for this because
nothing is wrong with this wig now
anybody knows I don't know about them
but me I'm loving him sure you guys are
back and all I did was I just simply put
some edge control
on my edges as you can see and we just
tucked it up underneath the lace and it
looks like my hair blends greatly with
this so it just looks like it's all one
moment which I love because it's very
easy you guys know I love my straight
hair to death but there's nothing like a
nice natural flow so if you guys are
natural or you're somebody who's going
through a transition relaxed to natural
this wig probably would be your best bet
because if your edges are still a little
more relaxed it'll look kind of more
like this probably I pressed mines but
okay but if you if they were a little
more relaxed or there were a little more
course they were bling regardless so you
have the best of all worlds it wouldn't
look crazy you know like we strain here
or wave here you have to make sure it
blends because if it don't look crazy
so yeah yeah not rumbling for me again
wig is from RBG show love it I love it
like a fat kid loves cake I will be
running this little puppy forever
probably it's gonna be one of those wigs
you know my middle part straight one set
a bone until hair start falling now so
although the link to this wig will be
below if you guys have any questions put
them below if you have any questions in
here not on here like that
