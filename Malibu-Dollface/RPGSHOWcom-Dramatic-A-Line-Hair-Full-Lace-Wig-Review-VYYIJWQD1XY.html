so this wing is really dope and the
reason why is because you guys know I
listen you guys know I love RPG show
wigs and I love them for their middle
parts because there's they're the
easiest week from wigs for me to do
middle parts with but it's a middle part
on top of the fact that it's an
asymmetrical get down in the back so
obviously this is very reminiscent of
missing Nicki Minaj she wore this style
a few times as well as she wore it with
bangs so I thought why not this actually
would be cute they said it's some of our
their new arrivals that were coming so I
just did the technique the lane
technique that I always doing all my
wigs and then I'm gonna give you the
specs on this particular wig I just want
y'all to look real quick they did a good
job cutting this wig it's not as short
in the back as I would like it so it
doesn't sit right where it's supposed to
be like it's a little longer which i
think is fine because it gives me the
ability to cut it a little shorter if I
like it you know instead of having it
too short when it comes because
everybody's head is not the same and how
this wig fits on me may fit a long face
person very differently so everybody
depends so it's good that they give you
a you know an extra a little bit you
don't oughta cut take it to somebody
that knows how to cut because you can
ruin your good unit so to the wig this
wig is a stock wig it says this has
ombre highlights which I don't see no
highlights in this wig that is all it
looks like 1b to me it's a human hair
wig it is cold in s 0 0 7 - s the hair
color is a number 2 so yeah I don't
really know this to be a to the hair
length in the front is 18 and then the
back is between a 10 and 12 so I would
say it was a 12 and you can cut it to a
10 you know to make it to your liking
hair texture is silky not a Yacky so it
is a silky texture this this is
definitely a silky texture the lace
color is a light brown so everybody asks
me like what color's your lace is always
like brown because that's the only one
that
to my scalp the mist the cap instruction
is a cap number three the cap size is a
once which is usually a petite I have a
small head and a big face so yeah my
head is not as big as my face so all my
caps that I do have are small and again
if you do not like RPG shows wiggler you
buy one and there's something wrong with
it do not got the lace off and just in
the back so I've had this wig for about
a month but not a month is going on a
month now and I popped it on to go to
the store and I popped it on to run up
the street and I popped it on when I
went to the beach and it's a very easy
unit is it's very to the point it's
really no like um it has combs in it and
has an adjustable strap has two combs on
its side and entrusted will strap in the
back this is for the person who's very
scared of length but you don't feel like
you look good and really long hair this
kind of gives you the best of both
worlds you still have the straight in
the front that's only 18 it's not like
it's 22 in the front although I've seen
people do this Bob this asymmetrical get
down and maybe all the way down here and
it just looks very stupid so yeah I
think this - this is a good ratio but
anything longer would just look kind of
ridiculous it's already extreme but I do
like it I think it's very nice it was
easy to lay it already had a heart the
thing that I'm learning that RPG show is
doing which is I think is great is
they're kind of pre putting the parts
and the wigs so it's easier for you to
kind of sit it where you want and then
adjust it to your liking like I can move
this wig anywhere if I want my part to
be illustrator I can do that you know so
I mean and then I just put a little
concealer in my part and then that was
the end of that so yeah I like this
though I think this is great the density
the RBG shell density is perfect for
this wig because it allows it to be very
flowy without being heavy and I've seen
people do this and it'd be really like
this be high like this and they'd be
real thick and that's not attractive
because it still moves it has
a lot of movement to it still it's not
dry it's not you know blunt it actually
has movement I would just have to go
again back here to just cut it to my
liking to kind of make it exactly what I
want but I do like it so this is a good
candidate for those who want something a
little different you put it behind your
ear like I have mines on this side you
can keep it down it kind of lends itself
to be something funky but not
over-the-top like too crazy as a little
it has an edge to it but it's not
completely safe and it's not nothing
more to really say because it's just
like a half of a wig kind of sordid
because of the cut so you have the long
and a front and then you have the
asymmetrical in the back so if you want
to be a little funky or you're having a
photo shoot as Nicki Minaj are you just
feeling a little you know barb like then
I would definitely go for this or you
just want something a little bit
different um to try this will be
actually good cuz you go wear this to
work and well depend on where you work
but for the most part this will be good
if you work a place like a footlocker or
anything that has like a little sass to
it not corporate this is not a corporate
wig um but yeah I'll talk to you guys in
the next one all the information for
this wig will be below and I hope you
guys enjoyed this one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
