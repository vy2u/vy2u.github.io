lazy video because I just finished doing
regular videos but I'm like really tired
so what should I talk about um how about
this test compare right here to just
keep acting like a little bitch
oh you guys want to see my arm picture
hold on
you know the artist Hayden Williams he
did like these on the Leah's birthday so
I got a blown up and post it on my above
my bed cuz I just love her
um but this is gonna be a Babel lask
video just shooting
I'm not gonna do a Grammy video cuz you
know y'all do reviews and I'm all for
shows because it's just so pointless but
I will say the Grammys this is the first
time in a long time the Grammys have
really been horrible I don't I just
didn't get it
uh okay first off let me just say Lana
Del Rey did not show up and she tweeted
that she was not gonna be there cuz you
know you know I love me some lemon oh
right
um but it was cool though but she was
nominated for five awards but she did
announce what I did show the trailer
with her new song with Angelina Jolie
for Maleficent
um but it was boring like it was so wack
I didn't I couldn't believe that this
was the Grammys and this is what it is
now like it was just really bad
um Beyonce I don't know when she's gonna
like wash that conditioner out her air
because it was a mess that whole she was
lip-syncing I'm gonna with none of
y'all niggas gonna be I'd say she was
lip-syncing so it is what the it is
and I'm glad it came out because she
forever does that and she usually
hits her accused but she was lazy
tonight blue must have kept her ass up
last night or something because that
bitch was lazy she wasn't in st. marks
like I didn't guess I like two minutes
and 50 seconds she goes to pull the
microwave from her face and then she
puts it back like bitch no no you got
something else to do um I can't believe
Lord I'm not like her and she was
talking about Lana Del Rey and
bitch you over there lookin like
decrepit witch from east wind
like No
I don't like her she's she's whatever
congratulations to her though but not
really really um and that was it that's
all I didn't really care about too much
anything it was just throw whatever like
it was just like this video which is
whatever um what else can we talk about
um I did a questions and answers video
since I get asked so many questions and
I don't have a chance to like answer
them like I want to hmm
Sherri Shepherd said Sherri Tasmanian
devil Shepherd that bitch she says some
choice words about the gay community
which I won't get into I'm gonna do a
video about it but she's just so not
worth the subject is not so not worth it
if you don't agree you agree you don't
you don't I just don't like her like
there's a lot of people I don't like in
the industry and she's one of them like
I don't like her I don't like Star Jones
I don't like um Jesse Jackson I don't
like um al Sharpton Bill Cosby Steve
Harvey it's somebody else - I just
kidding Oh Rita Frank oh my god she
should've been the first I cannot stand
I read the Franklin and the reason why I
don't like her because she shot I come
from uncle paddy that does not work Miss
Patti LaBelle is grand and you don't not
come for her if you want to know what
she's saying look it up this feud has
been going on for a long time but what
really pissed me off about Aretha is she
likes to wear spaghetti strap is bitchy
you ain't got no spaghetti buddy I mean
and I know a lot of girls were top-heavy
and you're when your boobs are big
bitches the last thing you need -
spaghetti any damn thing with your
titties hanging like that and I'm always
struggling a straps she ain't right for
that like she this is cute and just like
a hair commercial I'll make that the
screen cap for this video come shoot the
 with me anyway um yeah but that's
why I like I read the Franklin earths
well yeah sure he just says like her
little two cents about what she feels
about the gay community and all this
other
what
have been that's it like everything has
been really boring as far as
entertainment goes I got a lot of stuff
going on that I'm gonna slowly but
surely tell you guys about um but I did
like five videos today so if y'all see
me in that damn hoodie and for the next
