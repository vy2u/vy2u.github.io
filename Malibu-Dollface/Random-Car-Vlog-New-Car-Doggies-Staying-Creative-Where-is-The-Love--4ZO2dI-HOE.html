me day I was supposed to give my car
wash today in the dust here that is
still there so that didn't work out um
but yeah I just want to talk about cuz
you know my last video was about Kimber
L
my last major video was about there um
and I do want to just kind of keep it on
a positive note I know a lot of people
you know they like what I have to say I
mean you have a people where their
little attitudes to which is it again
completely fine I like to have something
where I can have a conversation or you
know there's a dialogue created where we
can go back and forth and have what the
 is she doing back and forth about
you know whatever the situation is at
the moment or you know whatever but one
thing I think amongst everything that's
been going on right now that has been
missing is love
I think love where is the love whatever
- listen to birdie a lot lately but
maybe that's why play there's a lot of
love missing in the world and you know I
love everybody I don't hate people think
oh hey Tim brought bacon bro
actually I still love Kimberly I just
think that she's a bigot bitch sometimes
then I think you know sometimes you are
what you say you are you do you know
what you do is what it is so for me you
know a lot of people took my frustration
in that video and a way that they file
you just hate everybody doesn't agree
with you and it's not about people's on
the conservative majority agree for what
I had to say gay or not they still agree
what I had to say but the thing that I
didn't I don't like to do is be quiet
when I know for a fact I need to say
something about something especially
when it directly affects me it directly
pertains to me and it directly is
something that has affected me at the
point Jim and my hear in my life to a
u-turn is me people to do this bitch
this boxset turn you just did and you
can't drive
so I was one of those things where you
know you into a situation where you get
frustrated as always being a bit of a
punching bag no matter what you know
someone says a book says the situation
it doesn't matter you know because
etiquette at the end of the day you are
a human I am a human we have feelings
you know so when you're feeling you
always are being attacked you feel you
know by a group of people or individual
or whoever you feel you know a certain
way so that's why I express the way that
and again these platforms like YouTube
and Instagram
there are ways for us to express how we
feel just like she used her platform to
express our Chico and that was
completely and utterly part of her the
thing is when you single out a
particular person or particular people
then what ends up happening is that
those no matter what you're speaking
about a no how no matter how good your
truth is and there's always a way like
remember this in life there's always a
time when somebody can take your truth
and turn it into something else because
they feel away about how you feel about
your sister may pertain to them so I
want it in in the new year all of us is
just show a lot of those to one another
and that is going to be a bit difficult
to see in fact that you know our
president now will you know that's a lot
of frustration pop and all for most of
us however I don't think that it's going
to be very hard for we as people we have
overcome there and better so I
we're going to be fine um
yeah I'm as a lately just with me and
general I've been trying to just kind of
keep on a very creative path as a person
like I didn't want to kind of stay on
the hood open up with what I'm doing and
the things that I'm interested in and
stuff like that because I feel like
often that's what ends up happening is
I'll get into this groove run for
super-creative and then I'll fall out of
it and then get an out of school myself
like why did you do that why did you
stop all of the research that she was
doing about whatever you were doing why
would you stop you know looking for a
better way to up your game and better
way to express your creativity or you
know behind anything just just anything
why did you stop doing that and I notice
one of the stop is just like I get into
the scrum project I want to do anything
and doing YouTube is one of those things
that you know it's easy to get lazy we
can do I can do this all day and in some
problems when I actually have to do
something that requires a thought
process it requires me to actually get
up and think outside the box that's not
just me looking pretty and talking about
hair then those are the things that I
get the most excited about I'm not
really excited about you know how many
bundles I have and all that and although
it's nice and it definitely lends itself
to our portion of our creativity it's
not all my creativity it's not the only
thing that I can do as an individual so
I feel like you know for me what the
 what's up is it what are you
picking up thank you thank you should've
been home
um yeah so for me you know I feel like
it's just a lot of stuff that I want to
get to and kind of get into to just just
push myself to be better push myself to
be a better individual push myself to be
a better me no matter what the situation
is who it is who is with what's not with
you know that whole thing so this year
and my goal is to be as creative as I
can not you gotta cheer on this bike and
you can take your ass
elsewhere 1200 to come down I don't want
to kill my money so you know that's
really where I'm at with that's how
happy I'm trying to be in the news here
is pictures push myself nah nobody oh I
remember last year during this time it
was one of those things where I was
trying to push other people to be better
but they didn't necessarily want to push
themselves and you know you have friends
I feel like this is so much better cause
y'all can see me better cuz it's getting
dark and it's only us um but I feel like
you know when you're in a situation and
you have a group of friends and you guys
are and um you know you guys are very
close when you start trying to push
people and they're not even like nudging
their self it becomes a very big issue
and a very big problem and try to do so
for me as a person what I always try to
do is and I'm learning to do I guess
would you feel
that I'm learning to do is put
cor this will
anyway um yeah I just want a lot us and
keep pushing myself to do better things
and do and do greater things wear myself
that's what I want to do I don't want to
necessarily be one of those people who
are I'm trying to push a friend to do
something that they just legit don't
want to do or they want to do it but
they want you to grab their legs and
then pull them the whole way and
it's like this I only weighed 105 pounds
I can't barely push my
self so you think I'm going to push all
my knowledge I'm a strong bitch but it's
an all in mind okay not physically just
all in the mind so you know it's stuff
like that that I think people don't
understand and realize about just
following your dreams in general you
know it becomes a thing and it's this
again to my point this time last year I
was in such an ugly place and not ugly
with myself was just people who are
around me I was very unhappy with kind
of some of the decisions that I had made
the previous year and I really had no
reason to be mad I was then other than
myself we have I'm the one who put
myself here but I just became one of
those things where I just do feel
sometimes that you know I wouldn't I am
a person who pushes people or I'm a
little bossy when it comes to certain
things because if I know a person can do
something and I see they're just resting
on their laurels and they don't really
too much care about trying it pisses me
off just because I know in life I've
tried so much to do so many things to
try to make my life a better place and
do better things it kind of turns into
why can't you just get it why don't you
understand that what is what why don't
you understand that life could be better
as with letting you know so when I see a
person who I feel like I don't let me
give
 and I don't care then it came to me
off you know so then I get into a poem
I'm just like this is getting ridiculous
but you want some oh I don't give a
 because you're lazy and just say
that but then when I have 85 excuses as
to why the world is not in their favor
then I start to get it like and ain't
nobody handed me nothing either
so you submit acting like I'm just the
one that speaking from a rich Jewish
kids point of view like I don't have
internet no no type of information I've
never been in your situation and I told
the furthest thing from the truth but
that's what people like to do they like
to play the victim and I'm not I'm not
I'm not playing the victim I'm sorry I'm
gonna do that so yeah but I just you
know I like to do whatever mop comes to
mind you know if I want to shoot
something one day I'll shoot if I don't
want to do it I don't do it and that's
like the rest of the world I get lazy
too I don't want to do other things - I
gotta add a to - what is what it is and
you learn the thing is when you learn
from your mistakes in you you're
supposed to solve them all
oh that is little cute um but it's you
know you learn to be a better person
when you do better you know better you
do better some people don't want to know
better so they're not doing any better
they're doing they're just amazing a lot
of you guys have asked me my kind of
house but officers don't like everytime
domestic our minds like oh I always do
it usually when the dogs asleep just
because when they're up and we're
running around and acting stupid in it
but most importantly to take them with
me not all the time but for the most
part when I'm out and there's I have
errands to run I'm going to go shopping
is the only time I really don't take
them but like right now they're not with
me they're at home oh but you know
they're doing great and I will say like
before our God knows I thought it was
just gonna be like you always think of
something wrong way then when that thing
changes you're kind of like and exactly
what I thought it's kind of level people
become parents and they say you're going
to be grossed out by diapers and stuff
like that and after a while you just
proving to and that's kind of hard to my
dog so what I need something I gotta
wipe something up it doesn't bother me
as much as you do when I first got them
now is it kind of like let's get up and
then keep pushing stuff love you so for
me I can see my life right now without
him which is crazy because I remember
when I'm at one point when I was going I
thought about getting a dog I still
wouldn't I wasn't sure if I wanted to do
this but when I got an idea I was very
happy because she was so cute you so you
know she still is you you bad but she
still is cute and she still does
smashing more energy and I got him after
her but you know it's just when that
little and tiny is the point where I
come over to me I get what they get over
to certain hump I guess I want to get
like they last little batch of shots and
they able to go outside and they can run
around and do whatever it makes me a
little bit bad because I like some
little baby space where and it's baby
you know animals in the foremost way are
like baby humans like when Richie was
little I would literally he will wake up
he will cry I will see him he will come
when he's going to be out of and then
after that I would run around like legit
one time around the apartment and he
would be so tired he will go back to
sleep and he'll be see from Supriya
and I meant that point but now they want
all of my adventures and that's why I
ended up getting him in the first place
because she she couldn't take when I
would leave she couldn't take she could
I would leave her in a cage I was beat
her she would be you know happy was
played in America so now I gotta you
know do this do this do that do that and
she was clean like scream oh I have to
take her with me so I had to get
something that would change that and she
just kind of had the separation
separation anxiety
I was leave because when I got her she
was so small because when I did your
Richie I got him at the appropriate
times and when I was closer to him I got
it for weeks
Richie I got a ten week so he is
definitely not as although he likes
attention he's a big baby is woody
really is what I did notice is the fact
that he um he doesn't so much care about
being separated from me unless I like
let them in from being on a balcony and
and I don't pay him any attention he
feels like this so you say to me right
that's the only time that I feel like he
feels any type of way about other than
that I feel like he's great
you know he cannot get out the car and
he's fine I got out the car was tonight
oh my gosh she just willing got an
attitude she mad and I'm like girl
what's wrong with you like you had to
like the Craiglist open up every fling
my daughter compass
don't let her heal yourself
you know is one of those things where
you know I feel like I can see my life
without them it's hard to think of how
life would be if I did have them any so
there they're definitely like a staple
in my life I look when certain things
happen I look at what ages they were
when I used to play together where they
play together now when they were really
smaller you know it was like is like
legit having two children so for me you
know I'm kinda in a place now where I
really want a toy doll or a teacup but
they are so prone to dying they're so
prone to having accidents they are so
prone to you know just a plethora of
health issues that I don't really
necessarily think I want plus they are
very very very very expensive and I I
did it I don't like to purchase animal
keeper there's so many rescued animals
that need a home so I don't want to hear
nobody preaching about here I mean even
in funny part I did it oh and I ain't
could they cost too much some of these
bones are down payments for cars
and bacon of course I are you going to a
blinker a blinker is there for a
reason
but yeah I am you know my birthday's
coming up I've had the car for I think
gonna be here so now I'm feeling like
you know I'm kind of on the card quite
small as opposed to my life now when I
got the car I did not have to salt when
I got this car I did not have a
load of stuff that I would keep in my
car and the car that I had previous to
this was also a beetle but it was a arm
and was a hardtop so my I don't think
y'all know how small my trunk is
it is a little issue you look like a
moron so it's definitely smaller than
what I am used to and I know I can't get
anything with a sleeve a little
non-invertible in it so I'm looking at
new cars I've test drove and everything
and that's kinda the thing that sucks
for me right now is the option throw so
Porsche Cayenne which is obviously a
four-door car that's bigger you know
then what I'm really want but I was just
plan on
of course our test drove the beetles a
chest rolls but with everything BMW
Mercedes everything and I just can't
necessarily justify like right now if I
had to pick I would probably going to
get a Jewish now the reason why I don't
want to get a G Wagen is because I know
for a fact that my note is going to be
stupid and I just don't want a car that
is that big I just like how it looks
like a bit like a mini version of that I
would so with it but um it's just
too big of a car for me I got so small
dogs and it's me I don't care Lee rarely
ever have my friends with me enough to
have to justify that much space and I'm
a little car driver I like much to be
very small so I wears them Timmel it
will see but most likely it is where I'm
going to stick with my beetles and just
get a newer version of it because of the
simple fact that I just don't want to go
outside of what I know and everything
that I have seen that I can't afford
which is quite a few things
I just don't never really see the point
of it like I don't want to dip it to my
shoe money to pay my car note for a car
that I really hit the home budget so my
husband you know so yeah I'm on my way
home I was going to go walk I'll just
say I was going to go bike riding but I
just tried to get your foot
oh yeah I will catch all in my next one
I'm gonna take her either one away</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
