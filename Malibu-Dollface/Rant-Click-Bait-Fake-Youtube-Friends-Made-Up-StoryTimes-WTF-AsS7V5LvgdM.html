day oh okay so we have done a new setup
for show up and um obviously my
background is still the same as it was
probably last time you guys saw me but
smooth this I wanted to do something
else a bit different I got to get used
to looking here and not here for the new
year so that's what I've really been up
to that's why I really haven't uploaded
as of recently but I have just been
really taken some time for me I was just
sick everybody I know is sick which is
crazy and annoying um so yeah what's
really been that what's on my mind
that's really what this video is gonna
be so first oh one of the major things
that you want to talk about that has
just really been an annoyance to me its
clickbait on YouTube it's just getting
low ridiculous some people are going to
be offended by this I really don't give
a fuck but yeah so you guys know if you
guys don't know what clickbait is if
this video was titled how I got into a
fight with Whitney Houston but really
I'm talking about my day when I brought
I so for uh that whole thing is kind of
wack so um yeah it's just kind of
getting ridiculous because everybody now
is doing YouTube and everybody is just
so thirsty for the views and everybody
is just so it's so manufactured and it's
so fake and bullshit and it's just like
if I go look for a video on how to get
the fucking space off of my Mac why in
the fuck are you telling me about this
highlighter that you brought bitch I
don't care so I feel like a lot of times
now especially for new people who are
moving quite like listen my you ride has
been slow and steady some people's is
pretty rapid sometimes it depends on you
know which your content is sometimes it
depends on who you're friends with just
depends but for me um you guys know this
never been my style I don't want to be
known on you too
because my friend is someone of some
status that may be above me I don't want
to be known on YouTube because I was
kicking it with this person or fuck this
person or any event like I feel like a
lot it's a lot of that going on is I'm
friends my bestie is this person my home
is that person so y'all shall like me
too and you guys know I've had a lot of
my friends in my videos so don't get me
wrong I say this cuz I've done this and
I'm sure they got a lot of you guys
following them because you guys seen
them on my channel or my Instagram or
whatever but a lot of times it's so
manufacturing and so fake you don't
really care you know what I'm saying
like you don't need too much care about
what this person has to say because
they're gonna put on a bullshit video
they're gonna pull out a bullshit story
time they're gonna put out a bullshit
tutorial they're gonna put out a
bullshit challenge just so that they
can't go in line or what's trending
right now on YouTube which is cute but
here's my thing with them I have been in
the last four months working on a show
with someone that has a career you know
she does a lot and I went to a meeting
with her and the meeting was for a big
company you know a big Network and the
thing that the assistants said to me as
well as the man that we were talking to
was like what's your video we were
sitting on your page for hours watching
your content and I'm just kind of like
and that's what you're supposed to do
and he was like well the reason why we
say like that is because a lot of times
when we do look for other people to
either be a part of this cast or look
for other people to do things it's all
clickbait it's all bullshit is all
nothing of any substance which we
consider an industry to be clown shit
and it's we're happy to meet someone who
actually says they're gonna do which is
sad that now you have to praise somebody
for just doing what they say they was
going to what the title does so for me
it definitely turned me off of you to a
whole life it definitely has um that's
why I really don't and
new year for sure I'm gonna spend a lot
more personal time with you guys when a
lot more things that I think that you
guys would be interested in I have not
forgotten my dog about the dog vlog
which is almost done I just had to put a
little more pieces in it um you know
frozen frozen idea Ritchie it just
depends on what you know we're doing
that particular day um I still doing a
video for my bun which actually did
yesterday it's just a lot of stuff more
a lot more hauls as you guys can see the
lighting is different and it's gonna
start for a very good purpose in a very
good reason um but I just feel like
YouTube is not what it used to be and I
get you know the evolution of anything
is going to change something drastically
especially when it's very saturated I
just feel like a lot of people today are
just thinking fake like oh no I don't
care over this is fake it's just full of
bullshit you know people are making up
stories as they go about shit it does
never happen to them and it's crazy
because then you will be like didn't you
say that you really didn't do anything
in your teen years how are you coming up
with like every week there's a new video
about some shit that you did as a
teenager where you lying about that are
you lying about that I don't know oh
listen it's just opportunity together
very quick especially when I smell
bullshit and trust me I have this gift
that can like smell a line but again
that's their business and whatever they
do it which you let me just say this and
people are gonna take this so much shade
and it's so not yeah I'm just I'm just
point out what it is
what if president got like 85
commercials on a one video you that
should kind of be a red flag you know
about like damn bitch I get the first
commercial maybe a middle commercial but
it's like every five minutes
it's a Verizon it's a Samsung commercial
if I want to watch the video not pay
your bills bitch but listen I'm not
hating get how you live for real it's
cuz it's definitely no hey what I have
been up to if you guys give a fuck
um I've definitely been doing a lot of
stuff creatively that is not hitter
related um actually have something for
the end of the year I have something for
Christmas coming up
no chocolate comes out next year uh I
just have a lot of stuff that I'm
working on that it's not YouTube in hair
related it will be uploaded to YouTube
but it's just so many different things
so if you don't catch me on snapchat
with your shit which is at Malibu
Dollface I'm probably with the dogs to
going for a walk or actually studying or
something else that I'm interested in
that I want to kind of make pop and do
something that's a bit different from me
that everybody named mama isn't doing on
YouTube that's fucking boring but again
I'm not knocking nobody for what they do
because when all is said and done you
get how you live your numbs in so that's
cool but I just think that a lot of
times there's a lot of a lot of thick
egos going on with people who get this
much stardom and they act like this and
you just kind of be like okay you know
and then you guys know I deal with I'm
sure you guys have seen the hate that
I've been getting just in different
stuff from a lot of bitches who don't
have no edges and they shaped like
Frigidaire refrigerators but when all is
said and done it comes with the
territory cool of me I'm used to it now
so I just I take it in to all and stride
a lot of you guys were asking me what
were you guys see any of my friends on
my channel in the upcoming year and yes
I will bring back people that you guys
know that I was cool with not everyone
but you know some people that you guys
know just to have my little pals and
stuff like that I'm gonna try to do
collaborations in another year I know I
haven't did any um I don't think I did a
collaboration since late
Rudeboy gay male then you guys know
Edwin oh but see I want to do I want to
work with other people because they may
have some knowledge that I don't have
it's just today everybody is out for a
fucking follow everybody is trying to
get poppin on social medias but you just
don't know what it is this morning so
I've been very like hmmm you know and
it's just it's just how I've been I've
always been like that I just don't like
to try to come upon somebody else shit
and I don't want nobody coming above me
because I work very hard for what I am
so therefore if I don't feel
it's a good fit then I'm not trying to
help you progress you need to learn how
to get it on your own if we get to the
same level or close to it and something
feels right and it does something then
great if it doesn't great I don't care
but that's my whole thing and a lot of
people in you're a bitch for that and
it's like okay we're fine I'm a bitch
then go lies it's a 100 thousand other
people you could find if I tell you know
that should not be your your reason to
try to expose somebody and it's just the
edges it gets to a point where it's just
it's regurgitating bullshit you know you
hear the same thing you hear a person
say things like I grew up being bullied
let's just say that I love being bullied
but then you get on YouTube and you do
the very thing that others have done to
you that's one thing when somebody says
something off-kilter to you or somebody
makes a very off remark about your
appearance the way you do something the
way you look the way you talk whatever
but if a party if you're just being mean
to somebody for the sake of being mean
to them is really why I hear about the
Mean Girls in the make a community which
i think is really bad cuz I'm gonna be
honest with y'all most of us who are gay
grew up being bullied we grew up having
people saying shit about us and that
happens but why would you go and become
successful in life instead of doing
better things with yourself you just go
back to what was done to you I get hurt
people hurt people but really it's just
what like people have this very wack
demeanor about them and everything is
about a point and everything is a lot of
dollar and I'm doing this because I know
what I'm worth and I'm doing it
my chest is here but your confidence is
here and you see it through the whole
video you see it and sometimes you can
be a little cocky i I've been that way
but I've only gotten that way honestly
when people have come at me bitch don't
say when it's fuck I ain't done and you
know perfected like when growth talk
shit about me because I don't agree what
they're saying or they say something
well I don't want to be rude but you
should shut the fuck up there but I want
to take this any other and I'm like well
you talk about all this shit and now
that I don't reply back I'm all type so
I'm never gonna be you all this super
shit
but you
when talking I see when I was help you
trying to Joanie on your fucking nap but
you definitely did get me fuck then you
was on for me then so I get that point
but when other people just sit back and
they're mean-spirited like they
everything is I'm you're not on my level
I don't do that honey to where I'm going
places I'm going to the people that I'm
seeing it's like you're never going to
see those people you're never going to
see those things with that not ever
okay I met I went to this set of scream
queens for season two and I got to meet
Jamie Lee Curtis and what I got out of
that meeting her because I am a huge
joke uh fan of Halloween and holiday
cheer oh and you know True Lies all of
these movies that she's been in and she
was the sweetest most humble woman that
I've ever met in my life
she is a icon and she was helping people
get chairs she is an icon and she sat
down and had a conversation with me
about shoes she is an icon who asks me
that I want anything so what that did
for me was let me know it does not
matter how many followers you have water
fuck you come from what the fuck you
have you are still no better than
anybody else and if she has a person who
is an icon can do that then these little
raggedy bitches here on YouTube need to
shake the fuck up before they get
shipped the fuck out I'm just saying
because the way that I mean is just
cringing to watch someone literally
expose embrace and disrespect and these
drama channels oh my god and just it I
feel like this okay and like I said in
the beginning video I really don't give
a fuck man
but these drama channels they take drama
with this person in that person is
naming portal in it so now drama
channels now make up drama hair drama
youtuber drama now has a place with
drama channels and I have a problem with
them because I care
I've watched them but what I don't like
is that you see people go from being
such a nice person to soon as they get
they talk about I got merged coming I
got all of this anyway
but ain't nobody will buy that raggedy
shit ain't nobody give a fuck like are
you serious right now
or you have people trying to give it
vital how to be a successful youtuber
and they haven't even got over 100,000
people to follow it ass but you get
hundred thousands of views I mean that
the continent you have low people care
about what you're doing nobody cares
yeah I'm just saying you know and for me
I'm sure if I've befriended a few
motherfuckers by now and he was friends
with a few motherfuckers then I will be
at the million mark but you know I'm
asleep good at night knowing that
everything that I've done and all the
people all of you guys who are here I
did this pretty much on my own
I did this with uploading when I feel
like it what I feel like it you know at
the time I felt like it I wasn't in a
race with her and a race with him to try
to beat out this person for numbers and
all this stuff because I like to upload
content that I can stand by I don't want
to be like my most viewed video on
youtube is a clickbait video about
somebody that's that's like you get what
I'm saying so I think people see the
number aspect about it and be like okay
well if I get as many numbers then I can
do this but I know people who have way
more subscribers than me who are living
went worse than me which sucks I mean
your business sucks and that just goes
to show so it must only be about the
numbers it kid
yeah you know so just a little ramble
I'm doing great
the dogs are doing great I'm feeling
great I'm ready for the new year I'm
happy as I can be
um hood radish is I want to be and yeah
I'm just I'm in a good place where a lot
of shit that I used to tolerate a lot of
shit that I used to just sit back and
let happen a lot of shit that I felt but
wouldn't say I'm
anymore if I feel some type of way about
whomever what the fuck ever I'm going to
say and if I may got a problem with it
you can argue with yourself because what
I'm not gonna do is what a lot of these
people on the internet are doing is
arguing and you're uploading a 14 minute
video and waving her response and
another 14 minute we're not going to get
I'm sorry I don't give a fuck how many
checks you're trying to get off an
argument it's just whack me then again
what people don't understand for any of
you guys who are watching this and you
guys are youtubers are you making the
difference stop putting your fucking
business on the internet because again
you're getting views and people are
caring about what you're doing only
because it's drama but when all of a
sudden you can't get nobody to book you
for nothing or you just can't upload
anything without being the source of a
problem you won't be around for long
trust me you will not be around for long
make your channels fun do something as
different do something that's new but
this shit that I'm seeing right now guys
so got here bored of you so I'll catch
y'all in my next one I did a fucking
video y'all and it was the wrong but Lee
was up so I had no audio and I can't
upload it oh man but I'll catch up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
