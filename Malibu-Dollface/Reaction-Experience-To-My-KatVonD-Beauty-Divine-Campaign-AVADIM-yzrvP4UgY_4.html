see this right now this collection is
super limited it is available at Sephora
right now and also girl when you open
the palette sephora's all over because
my the campaign idea for the Kat Von D
divine collection is now all the Sephora
is the displays are up so I'm going to
take as many pictures as I can with all
of them just are giving this much for
you mom
so yeah let's see what we can following
all right I'm gonna always first of all
which is the Woodman law in the valley
we're gonna see if they have it at safar
you tell I just got up like an hour ago
what you
there's any type they have enough all
there don't be a better lipstick now
the other my it is soul
which is so freaking time at night
that's crazy
I've never thought that I would be anime
go campaign but it's really weird that
now I can literally go to a store and
like pee myself
and like five products even though I
have like 80 of them already so that was
the first to pour down this is what
March 8th 2018 so we got like then we'll
go to five different stores and pick up
like as many pallets as I can or one so
I should have like five or six when I'm
completely done do you guys see this
like this is using a brain
I actually met Kat
on Instagram she reached out to me and
her exact words were I have something to
tell you I promise you're not gonna tell
anybody I want you to be a part of this
shoot that I'm doing and I'm like oh
Jesus
me out of all people me you sure you got
the right hand okay
I was like I just want to do something
that just shows people how great a
performer that Devine was before she
could finish I was like I'm down
everybody doesn't get this opportunity
to pay homage to an icon the writing's
like the original drag superstar and the
vine look was so iconic they actually
used her for the inspiration for to see
which Ursula from Rubbermaid
prepared with Tara she's been amazing
the woman is a genius she's a magician
with brushes usually when it comes down
to makeup I get a little nervous cuz I
don't sit in everyone's chair but she
made me feel very comfortable and she's
making me not feel like I'm a mannequin
do what you want
I love Kat Von D beauty because it
caters to everyone
Kat was one of the very first people dad
had foundations in my shade with Kat you
know you're gonna get quality she
actually puts out things that she
believes in and the color as a kid I
grew up with obsession with Barbies and
that was because Barbie was everything
she worked at McDonald's and she was the
president she has a Corvette a horse
beach houses and I'm like this is like I
wanted to live my life in Technicolor
just like these boxes it's gaudy its
colorful but it's me they say you want
to get one life and use it so I try to
find the most interesting thing I can
and make it work and it doesn't feel as
if it's like a costume but of Who I am
as an individual
when I first saw the look my heart
dropped I was hoping that I got that
look
and I do well this look it matches my
personality how I feel on the inside I
feel like if you could see what my
personality was it would be what I had
one right now which is larger than life
a lot of colors and I can't be confident
unless something shining owe me
something
Pat's energy carried the entire shoot to
have her be so hands-on because this is
a passion of hers with beyond me
you know dragons an art form to be able
to be this beautiful as the girl next
door to me is a plus and I'm truly loved
people like divine for giving me the
opportunity to do this to be Who I am
and standing my truths and be loud and
proud and not really care not many
people can do that you know in life it's
like I'm gonna be judged so you're gonna
be judged whether it's good or bad so I
feel like the vilest a person who just
was like this is Who I am as an
individual if you don't want to take it
that's fine I'm still gonna be here make
up hair and all when you see a person be
so fearless and actually living their
truth - like the 10th power it's amazing
and that's a wrap going up my ass
there was a success I look like a hood
Iraq meets Widow she came with me oh we
had a great time okay thank you
milk studios but everything does we're
amazing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
