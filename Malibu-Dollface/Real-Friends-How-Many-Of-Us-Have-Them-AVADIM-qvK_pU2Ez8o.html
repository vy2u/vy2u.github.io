hot minute since I've done an update
video and it's just because I mean who
just how you know my mind I'm gonna say
a subject video cuz you know I just I
just give me a break okay but anyway um
I know but this this subject is gonna
definitely be about friends because in
the last I want to say like four to five
months I have a lot of so-called friends
out of my circle like I don't with
a lot of people no more and people
forget the benefits of having friends
and they forget that you have to in
order to be a good friend you have to be
a good friend you know I'm saying and
these are fundamentals that I think a
lot of people forget um so I'm just
gonna start from there um like I said in
the last couple of months there are a
lot of people that I was really cool
with that show their ass and show their
true colors with me and I just was like
you know it's just better off that we
just don't speak because
understand this as a friend you that's
having friends is a luxury it's like
having a car you can still get to work
on the bus you can still you don't need
our car but it does make things easier
and that's the same thing with friends
having friends makes life easier and
makes it fun it makes it have you know
cohorts it's a good time if they're the
right people um want somebody that I was
really cool with for a number of years
really showed his ass this year it
really didn't bother me and more so
bothered me the fact that he pretty much
sided with these people that I didn't
know that got into with me over some
 was everything was very petty
you know and trust me I am one for
pettiness y'all don't be but in this
situation I'm just kind of like really
that's how you feel like I thought we
were cooler than that but I definitely
see that we're not and it was a
situation to happen before that that
really kind of made me question his
friendship as well so that pretty much
just put the out put the icing on
the cake and for a number of years me
and this this person
we would not be friends because I would
feel like he's not being genuine he's
not real he's not this he's not that and
all my friends would tell me like you
need to stop with him like for
real he's like he's he's definitely not
on your level which I hate when people
say that cuz it's it's really rude cuz
that that would imply that you are above
somebody which i think is really wack so
I never listen to them and they would
just be like you know he's just not
authentic you know he definitely gives
off a a very false fake vibe and I'm
just like well we're friends you know
I'm saying like we really know each
other so it's kind of cool like that you
know but yeah they was right because he
was not that you know and again I don't
have any ill will towards that person
like I wish them nothing but the best
I'm not mad at them anymore um but it
just kind of sucks when you've been cool
with somebody for so long and then they
do something so disrespectful to you and
you just like really but if I were to
did that I would have been wrong it's my
 in the book but then when you
say something to them about it whether
it be that person or anybody else they
act like you don't want to brought the
 to the table you look oh so you mad
at me cuz you did something wrong okay
so yeah that sounds about right
my focus today do not understand that
you cannot get what you want from our
focus just on the strength of y'all cool
you can't just be a sometime friend
because when you are sometime friend II
sometimes i'ma with you and
sometimes I'm not gonna with you
that's that's pretty much the bracket
and what you're putting yourself in so
understand this again like I said before
having friends is a luxury that is not a
necessity okay you need water to survive
that is an assistance you need to eat to
survive all this should I go back here
this is luxury this is not because I
need it I don't need clueless I love
clueless but I don't need clueless you
know I'm saying you know I don't need
chunky I love jerky but I don't need
chunky and that's the same thing with
friends they can come and they can go so
will and broken and I have been friends
for I think Minister will have been
friends for probably I think it's going
on tinnie this year will make ten years
that we have been friends and in the ten
years of us being friends I think we've
had one fall out and it wasn't even a
major fall out it was like this so when
stuff like that comes up about
you know you as a real friend you can
work through the drama anyone even
nothing major because me and him just
don't harder because our ger me and him
do not argue because we are very much
alike we're very much different so we
don't have to agree to disagree and then
let it you know just what it is like
okay um but there are other people who
want to take from you but they don't
want to give you anything they think
that you should always be there but
they're never there and then when things
change for them whether it be financial
whether it be living situations whatever
the situation is they want to now have
all of your attention whereas before
before their circumstances changed they
could care less of you around they could
care less if they with you or not
you see what I'm saying so it's like you
want to with me when it's
beneficial to you but what I just want
to kick it and be friends that's the
problem that's why a lot of people that
I dunno when they hit me up like oh we
should be cool and then it never falls
through nine times out of ten it's their
fault that it didn't fall through
because I'm like look I'm free I'm ready
if you want to kick it if you want to do
this if you want to do that cool fine
whatever
but then I gotta do this I gotta do that
I gotta do that when you start trying to
you when you make people in an option
versus a priority they're gonna start
treating you like an option I don't have
to with you I got other friends I
don't want to be cool with you
stop calling me get the out of my
face I'm bitch we ain't cool like that
lose my number like it'd be like that so
for me now when I meet new people which
is not very often cuz I'm just not a
very social person like that like you
guys know me I don't kick it with a lot
of I'm not friends with my
photos because I could see the
too a lot of everybody
want to be famous for nothing everybody
want to be your friend cuz they want
something everybody like I'm just good
girl I'll let you let that bitch do that
because I'm not gonna do that with you
okay so when it comes to that again
friends are something that we all I
don't know people who've been friends
for a number of years and they fall out
over something so tedious I can't stand
cuz this has happened to me I have a
friend well yeah my friend I'm what but
I had a friend
we were really cool we have been cool
for a number of years and then he had
dated one of my friends and then when
our friends you just went off the rails
you know or whatever but him and I still
stay very cool
then he got a boyfriend y'all know what
is she about to go so he got a boyfriend
and having his boyfriend I remember one
time I called him I don't know what was
going on in my life but I called him or
whatever but it wasn't nothing like
serious serious because I would have
call somebody else you know we would
necklace but we was close enough so I
called him to be like you know what's
been going on how are you doing that he
chose me in the middle of me talking
well I'm sorry to hear that and stuff of
my boyfriend he's here so I'm gonna have
to go I've been knowing you for how long
and you just got with this funny
 are you serious like this
and he was not cute okay like you gonna
have to dismiss me for somebody on a
better level than that I don't like to
call people on levels but that nigga was
not on a secular level about oh I'm
sorry that it was just not there so you
know I'm just kind of like okay so I
didn't say anything about it I would
just like okay and then after that I
guess they had broke up or whatever the
situation had may have been and then he
was trying to like be cool again and I
told him I said I do not wish to have a
friendship with you not because of what
you said is how you did it and how you
treated me understand I've been friends
with you longer than you've known this
big ugly so the fact that
you would treat me like that that lets
me know that your is a possibility that
you will do this again so she fool me
once shame on you fool me twice shame on
me that would be my fault and I'm about
to give you that option to do that
again
like some people you have to understand
he was like well I'm trying to hear me
recently and was like I'm trying to
figure out why you don't want to be cool
with me but there are other
 in your like that have
done things to you and then y'all still
cool but he has to understand there was
a there's a like a plateau of how
everybody is rated differently
everybody contributes to my life in a
different way they're people that I've
been friends with since I was 13 that
I'm still cool with today and they're
 I've been friends with it
since I was 10 that I don't talk to no
more so you have to understand if we
were not cool like that then you're easy
to do I can dismiss you because that
means that you don't usually take our
friends
serious at all in my book that's how I
feel I'm one of those people if anybody
is not cool with me chances are that was
their decision not mine cuz I'm cool
with everybody there are people that
I've been friends with there's my
working I've been in relationship with
with that I still try to be cool with me
and I'm just like yo wait there I have
exits that we can go out and find
boyfriends together okay were that cool
there other who are
probably would hit with my car because
it's the way in which you do things you
have to understand you can't treat
people like and then try to sue
back in today life because now your life
ain't going so well you can't do that
and you're pretty much you're lasting
impression of a person it's something
negative they're gonna always see you as
that so again I think my friends very
 wisely I don't with a lot
of people because a lot of people
especially today are on a lot of
 they want to just be in your
presence they want to be around you
because they think you have something or
you you know things like Instagram and
YouTube and stuff like that that means a
lots of today so they feel
like they kickin it with the highest
 flies how they become your
friend because they feel like all these
doors are gonna open and I'm gonna get
all these opportunities to do this is
that any third and I've learned that
I've had to learn that the hard way
but learning the list so now I know you
know stick to the crew that you used to
you never seen because I mean sometimes
there are mothers and you're in your
core that you got to get rid of too and
it's happened like that there's the mofo
because I do I won't you couldn't pay me
to kick it with them cuz they on some
 like for real I can see right
through you that's what I'm that bitch I
will see somebody and act like I've
never seen you a day in my life
I will not acknowledge you I will not
say anything to you and if we left on a
very negative note chances are if I do
see you don't say them to me cuz you
ain't gonna get nothing and I might go
off on you so I'll just just stay over
there
I don't harbor no hate for nobody but I
just know who I don't with you know
Sam you know so it's just kind of that
type of situation like I'm just not
about to sit up there and try to be
friends with a bitch who I know I'm not
going it's that so if you have good
friends keep them if you don't have good
friends and you are good friends get rid
of the bitches in your life that are not
contributing to you but drama trust
me
I'm going through that right now so in
closing okay
um again for real for those who you guys
have really good friend of mr. will and
broken we are always gonna be in each
other's lives because we know how to
respect one another no matter what the
situation is what we go through how we
deal with we're always gonna have each
other because we know how to respect one
another no matter what the situation is
you're gonna have issues you're gonna
have problems that's life but a real
friend especially in today in 2015 it's
very very very hard to find so
if you do have good friends appreciate
them treat them like family and if your
family ain't then you treat them
like you want to be treated that's all I
got for you okay but I hope that you
guys did enjoy this and I hope you took
something from this because this is
something that I have to deal with on a
regular basis and there are people that
I thought I was so cool with that I
thought would never betrayed me or never
do anything less than respectful to me
that show and prove that to be very
wrong so you got it sometimes you gotta
give bitches aside when it comes to
boyfriends when it come to finances you
know everything is cool when everybody's
around when you rolling in money and you
have good but tell me the
 are there when you ain't
got when you hungry are they gonna
help you are they gonna do something for
you or they're your friend or they got
they together now cuz the whole
time y'all was friends they had a
together all of a sudden now they think
they doing something and they don't
wanna with you no more those are
the them did we call those
two snakes in the grass you got a wife
from Kazim by joe ass so look out for
the snakes appreciate the good ones that
are around you and I will talk to y'all
in the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
