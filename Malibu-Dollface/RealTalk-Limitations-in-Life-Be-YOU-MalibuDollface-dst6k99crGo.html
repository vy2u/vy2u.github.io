guess you could say know what to name is
video I don't know it's just more so
about me just the limitations in life we
can call it that the limitations are
morning um but it really is gonna deal
with the fact that I'm here looking like
a nice little black Barbie but just what
a week ago oh I had the braids I had the
whole get up and his crazy how people's
response was very different towards me
versus what I look like now which was
very positive like it was about 95
percent in dramas ain't nine point nine
percent positive like in our shop but
the reason why I wanted to do this video
is because that's usually done all my
life that's kind of been the the tone of
how people have looked at me you get
everything and I feel like no matter
what I look like I'm still the same
person but I think people just by you
know human nature are gonna treat you
different based on what they see what
they feel what they think is appropriate
and what's not and it kind of goes back
to to me being a kid I will never forget
um I remember it was Halloween and I
remember I wanted to be a witch that was
I had to be no more than six at the time
and I wanted to be a witch my mom is
quite young having me very young so just
bear that in mind and I wanted to being
a witch really bad on tours like you
know mom I really want to be a witch she
said okay she said it was fine and um
time came it was about a week before
Halloween and I you know that's gonna
get my wish customs and get it and she
said I couldn't be one and to me it
wasn't about the fact the witch was a
woman it was because I wanted to be that
but as a kid when when you don't
understand why somebody telling you know
and it's not I'm know
I'm being a bride I'm you telling me no
to the Halloween costume that I thought
I was gonna have fun with later did I
find out that my uncle's had got into
her head and told her you don't let him
do that he can't do that you know and I
was left to be a fucking pumpkin okay
which did not go very well over with me
but what it did to me at the time as a
kid is it kind of shattered my my point
to be creative you get what I'm saying
and what really really really made me
this come back to me as I was on
Facebook and I seen this little boy I
think it's things like Alfie and he did
the whole hocus-pocus of performance
when they actually go to the school
dance and they do this I forgot the name
it's been um but he did such a great job
and his mom had posted it and was like
you know regardless of the fact I'm
still gonna love my child I'm gonna let
him be as ambitious and is different as
he wants to be because quite frankly
when you're a kid it is pounded into our
heads to be yourself be yourself be
yourself that's what they teach you in
school
that's what most of our parents instill
in us at home but the problem with that
that particular statement is that as
soon as you become something or someone
that they don't necessarily agree with
then that notion no longer is valid and
that's where I have the issue because
when I was a kid and I was that young
nobody explained to me that the reason
why I don't want you to view which is
because I don't want you to go to school
that I love what people to pick on you I
don't want you to go to school and get
bullied or come home crying because
someone hurt your feelings based on
something you wanted to be but that is
not something that I was as I can't
really give him a choice to do it was
made for me and I get it your parents
have your best interest at heart but a
lot of times when decisions like that
were made for me I felt more stifled as
an individual be you know a bit to being
taken away than me be able to sit back
and walk in my truth is that
do this no matter what the situation is
so what I started to do is when I went
from you know just dressing just like a
boy and kind of dabble into makeup in
here and stuff like that at the time I
live with my grandparents and they've
been together for I think like 180 to
the years like it's been a while what I
did was because I never want to make
anyone around me that I care about
uncomfortable based on the decisions
that I make little by little start to
open up different avenues of the things
that I were trying new so that it wasn't
this big mosh mosh of just I went from
day to night like out of nowhere you
know I didn't want that to be my
situation especially with two people
that I mean the world to me I didn't
want them to feel like they're looking
at somebody that they did not know and a
lot of times when a lot of you you know
a lot of you younger kids or even people
that are my age come to me and say well
how did you get your family to accept
you or how did you get people to you
know be let you be you and be
comfortable and who you are and the
truth is it took time but I didn't do it
all in one day
but from this to this and then they're
just like I don't know how to take this
in it I did it little by little
now what I did in my own time was my
business but I also wanted to make sure
that if anybody ever asks me about who I
was and what I was and and and and who I
aspired to wanna be I had an answer that
was a practical answer that made sense
so whoever else that you told this to
for the most part unless they would just
begin an asshole would get what you were
trying to say and what you were trying
to do I think a lot of times people
especially with with the whole general
thing and that thing they see certain
things and they tell you that you can't
do that boys where this girl's worth
that but these are things that are put
upon us
based on just our gender and I don't I'm
more than my gender I'm more than my
skin color I'm more than my hair I'm
more than you know my genitals I am a
person that has a lot to give and a lot
of times people don't give you that
opportunity to give or show what you can
give because they're looking at just
this so when I did do the braids I knew
it was gonna be a little I didn't know
any respect you know for people to be
that
into it but you know I have evolved you
know from you - I didn't start YouTube
looking like this and I don't usually
look like this on a regular day I
definitely switch on my look depending
on how I feel but my look it's based on
fashion it's based on me having fun it's
based on me not being scared to push the
envelope to do whatever you know because
I feel like I'm living my authentic me
I'm my authentic self no matter if
people agree or not it's still something
that I personally take pride in to say
that I'm living you know my life to the
120 percent whereas other people who are
living for forty five percent because
their mom their dad their sister their
brother their friends are gonna have
something to say about it and what
people don't get is that everybody wants
to know how grown they are but you don't
have grown because you let other people
like a little kid you know stifle your
creativity or just you you to be your
own person because you're afraid about
what their opinions are gonna be but
when all is said and done when you when
I've cried when I've been upset when
I've been sad when I've been bullied
when I've had all these things happen to
me these very people that have so much
to say about what I do was not there
they were not trying to comfort and
change anything they just wanted to join
into the you know the charade the party
and and make me feel how they really
feel because it takes a very strong
person man warming transient whatever
you want to you know call it or
categorize it as and in the world there
are so many people who are so called
I'm fine I'm grown I own my shit you
know but then you have so many men who
either work DL and their deal not
because they wanted me but because
they're afraid of what other people are
gonna think so if you're such a man's
man then why can't you be a man and
stand up and say this is what I'm into
as well but because you're afraid of
where your friends your family and
everybody else is gonna think this is
what you do that's why I think a lot of
people don't get it's very hard to live
in your truth it's very hard and it's
not an easy tax task to do but I sleep
well at night
to understand and know that I'm living
to the best of my abilities and
everything that I want
do everything that I want to try I try
and there's nobody that can tell me yes
or no you get what I'm saying I I'm
happy with the choices that I make I'm
happy that my hair is pink right now you
know whether somebody's got actually I
hate the pink on you that's fine and I
respect your opinion if it's given to me
in a polite respectful manner so
motherfuckers just have a tendency to be
a bum yeah talk to you crazy you want to
bitch and I got something for that ass
too but I don't I don't think a lot of
people understand that well you you
tease and taunt and disrespect someone
and ain't no ride if he like this and
why does she like that
you think so yourself why do you care so
much why do you care at the fact that
she likes a Zulu versus of Mercedes why
do you care that she likes Bobby box
over virgin remy Indian what why did
that matter to you but because a person
can say something and they can stand in
it it's hard for other people who can't
do that to accept it and I'm here to
tell you guys I do these videos because
I want you guys to get something from
them and I'm gonna tell you I have been
so happy just doing everything that has
come to mind because in life you're
gonna fill are you're gonna fly but I
rather try to say I didn't try you get
what I'm saying like I'm I'm happy to
say yeah I tried this color really
didn't like it I tried this brand really
didn't like it I did this looking it was
my favorite and I wouldn't did it if I
would let everybody else's opinion
bother me like for instance Ivy just
recently did blonde and it was gorgeous
on her skin too like gorgeous and you
know people have this thing black girls
shouldn't wear a blonde hair and all
this other shit you know just stupid
shit and I'm like you know the thing
about life and the thing about fashion
and hair all these great things is that
you can there's no thing that you can do
unless you don't do it unless you let
somebody else tell you that you can't do
it you know it may it's not gonna be
everybody's Jewish it's not gonna be
everybody's favorite it's not gonna be
everybody's you know cup of tea but as
long as you're happy with it because the
point of life in your life to live it is
that you're
I could give a fuck about with Teresa
things are Jonathan or a big booty Susie
I don't give a fuck quite frankly
because I'm sure there's a list of
things that they do that I personally
don't like so being a kid and being told
no consistently was very hard for me
because there were so many things that I
wanted to try and so many things that I
wanted to do and I was pretty much
stopped from doing those things because
both boys don't do that and I feel as a
guy I feel cheated that girls get what I
have one right now you get what I'm
saying like I envy girls because it's
like unless you go to the little boy
section there's pants shorts and a
t-shirt and a jacket you go to the girls
section they got sandals sneakers boots
short dresses mini dresses long dresses
leggings frilly shirts lay shirts
t-shirts like you know saying is it's
just it's a plethora of things to play
with and for me I always feel like well
why can't I why you know what if it's
certainly things that aren't meant first
started people such and I would never
stick a tampon of my ass or anything
like that you know that's ridiculous
but when it comes to just clothes and in
the expression of oneself that's what I
really like people like Grace Jones and
Lenny Kravitz and oh my remote oh and
all of these people who push the
envelope there is no no for me there is
no this is too much for me
one reason why is to I mean I love
Michael Jackson and Prince Branagh
because they didn't care and some of the
people are the most iconic is because of
the different the lack of fucks that
they give about what another person
feels about what they do with their
stuff and I want you guys to know it's
really going into this new year whatever
you've been afraid to try whatever you
you just you sit back and you know
you're not too sure about try it give
yourself a time limit to try something
that you would normally not do because
of somebody else's opinion and you come
back to me upon this video and you let
me know if you tried it and if it were
because it's nothing more gratifying in
life is to do something that you were
afraid to do and succeed at it and able
to just say fuck you bitch
you said I wasn't gonna do it now what
when me and Ivy did the the gray hair
everybody named mommy was talking about
me look like Morgan Freeman's daughters
and shit then all of a sudden bitches
everybody named mama dog right here you
know and it's not the Rihanna gray it
was like silver and when people were
talking shit when it wasn't popping
people you know we're like that shit is
a mess as soon as they got poppin people
see you have to learn how to pioneer
some shit do some shit ain't nobody done
and everybody will follow suit I
remember it was one guy I don't know
what he does now I'm not gonna say his
name cuz we can knock it off you press
around easy no no but I remember when I
was working with envy and CB T's closet
and I was wearing all of them acrylic
necklaces that have a name on it said
borrow me some sake coffees worrisome
you know there was any different colors
very cute especially for my style at the
time and I remember this one particular
dude he just was just he was and I don't
wanna say fad I'm not standing in the
negative way but he was fast sloppy and
mad like that's what that person he was
you know so it's like when the ball
hitting a girl pig Owen the girl all the
hair that's what I was getting from it
and I didn't pay him too much Mike
that's quite frankly we we still ain't
in the same league he's still a mess but
um from what I've seen much hasn't
changed and um he was like you and those
party I will never forget this you and
those party scene necklaces need to do
something and I was like oh you maybe
you not even a year later I mean a Bri
bah dee had won everybody to the point
where I was off of them you know but I
thought about you talked to all of this
shit about me and even your fave got one
you hear what I'm saying even you know
your friend got one everybody but at the
time but if I would have let him affect
me in that way I would have been another
person trying to jump on the bandwagon
sooo when I really and my heart wanted
to do it and just did it because I let
somebody who's knows like a bell pepper
get to me be you be your authentic self
no matter what that is long as you're
not hurting anybody and as long as
you're living your life to the fullest
and you still fulfilled after you're
doing whatever then live it to the
fullest and be happy because a lot of
people are not living for themselves
right now they're living for other
people and other people don't matter
you met that's why it's called your life
that's what we all are responsible for
ourselves so stop letting people that
you are not responsible for vice versa
affect you in a way where you're not
happy you're living your life you're
you're punching a clock your is like
Groundhog's Day because you're afraid to
be your authentic self because of what
others have to say about you fuck other
people because a lot of these
motherfuckers are doing a lot of shit
that they stay talk shit about on the
loan whether it's sex drugs whatever
they do it on the loan be out and proud
about who you are and you'll be much
more respected for being who you are
authentically than being a fake version
of some shit that you really just don't
want to be and you're doing to try to
who wants to be who wasn't be normal
who wants to do to to to blend in cuz I
sure the fuck no hits what marriage
thing today because I know if anybody
had Barbie it probably was only blinded
but we're gonna be P so learn how to be
an individual learn how to be different
and and let that be your staple on life
on things that you do people that you
meet anything but be happy people light
is too short and for you not to be happy
and it's too many unhappy people judging
by these comments on social media they
want you to feel the way that they feel
upset mad don't have anything don't
don't let nobody get to you like that be
you 100% and I'll catch y'all in my next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
