like the Real Housewives or living in
pop anymore but I have been definitely
watching all of these shows so I'm kind
of gonna give my opinion because I know
Real Housewives is over this weekend so
I won't know much about the last episode
but I can do all the rest the Real
Housewives of Atlanta this particular
season I would say has been a good one I
got kind of turned off the show last
season because the whole Kim and Nene
drama was I was over it I just didn't
care anymore like it was so first season
so the thing that I don't understand as
far as this situation goes with kandi
and her mom and Todd is the fact I mean
obviously they got married so obviously
something had to give him I'm a Joyce
was in attendance from my understanding
but the thing that I don't understand
and I don't get is the fact that does
she said she doesn't want to check her
mom because of the simple fact that it's
her momma and that's my momma and I
don't get it with nobody say because she
been there for me and she's always gone
awry for me no matter what I do okay and
I told Riley that she was not the one
who said that about Todd she was just
telling me in there Cynthia came up in
here like hey kandi in his hands
kandi gives you a lot of hands and I
give you hands too but she just gives
you both down hands so yeah she don't
know how to check her mom and I know
it's the thing to not be disrespectful
and not be rude and all that I did stuff
but there is a moment where you do have
to check your elder at points because
they do forget that you are not you
ain't kids no more you are adults and
you need to treat me and act like I'm in
a tote like yes so that makes it look
like her mom I just don't have no man
ordinal friends but they don't notice
that her mamas or Ozzy and her mama when
they got she got into a car man she was
like she look like she was gonna hit
Joyce I ain't gonna hit on Joyce like
that like why is it the old lady who
Kenya Apollo and Phaedra I know here's
the thing some people think that Kenya
is just the scum of the earth because
she keeps trying to pursue Apollo
she said Apollo said but he could have
slept with her if he wanted to we could
have smashed
fazer should've smashed his ass dead in
the face did you guys notice how Kenya
said clear and like made it very clear
he said if I wanted to sleep with you
I could have she said but I never
offered you that and then he turned
around and said but I could have
so people who got issues and problems
and all this with Kenya they're not
really realizing what she said and he
admitted to she never offered him sex
that's what she said I never said that
we would ever do anything but he's
basically saying that if I ask you can I
smash she probably would have said yes
however she never came to him and said
yo let's do this that is what he said
before he said that she basically said
let me do this aside the other to you
okay so yes so I mean she could have
offered something else besides
full-blown sex I don't know can you like
that who knows I met her once but that
was so long ago i Nene and Gregg this
season the other thing don't even know
what I have for Gregg is that Greg needs
to open up his teeth before he starts to
talk to anybody because every time he
speaks this is like he's winnie-the-pooh
so he was like when I got into that
fight he was like no don't you touch me
don't you - don't try to check me Todd
like why he was on like a runaway slave
okay we need a boo
oh now reg seems like a nice guy besides
the fact that you know he sounds like a
stuffed animal Nene oh listen I always
say when it comes down to opportunities
you take them and I think that that's
what she's done and that's why she's
pretty much deep she's the last
housewife standing from that franchise
everybody has been replaced but her
that's great the issue and the problem
that I have is Nene speaks like she is
Meryl Streep she speaks like she is
Angela Bassett Channing Beyonce when it
come down to the acting and we all know
that I'm good
Nene I'm happy for your rise and your
fame and all this and all that and
that's cute and everything but girl calm
the down and then why do her wigs
look like Michael Myers wigs on that
damn ass
well what would you like for her to be
so rich she is very she's cutting
corners when it comes down to her hair
you see Portia who's only been on the
show for two seasons and her hair is
always late
even if she's working out is always late
phaedra for the most part pictures hair
is pretty much done Kenya's hair is done
Candide need help um who else is on the
show
Cynthia's hair is always done why are
you the matriarch of this exact like
this whole franchise yet and still you
do not know how to do your own hair you
know she was one in 27-piece second
season I wasn't for that well she was
wearing the the wig with the lift in the
back that Derek J was doing I was not
here for it last season when she had the
blonde with the with the piece in the
front
I liked it without the piece but you
can't bitch it ain't my life I like that
but now it's just getting to the point
where you just don't hear you're gonna
put on a full-blown length sometimes
didn't even like it's a lace wig
sometimes she just got a simple wig on
pull to the back and that's it no Nene
so Phi that she had with Marlo I can see
where Marla was coming from because
Marla is correct before Marla came
around Nene if you look at the past
seasons of Housewives Nene let the man
she was the biggest mess on the show she
had a four we've know part season one so
you know when Marlowe came in she
definitely upgraded Nene's since her
fashion and put that in the house like
money to good use with the nose and the
boob lift and the liposuction and the
hair and the clothes and the red bottoms
in the saline bag and all that I am my
heart departs I do believe that that
came from Marlo's influence so whatever
Nene want to say is her mother business
I really don't care but I do feel that
that is its true kind of hope in a way
that she doesn't end up leaving the show
because I think that if they replaced
her with someone else I'm hearing that
it might be Marlo which would be just a
such a slap in the face the whole fight
yeah with Marla I just think it's very
petty it's my she clans she ice creams
with her so you can't be friends with
her like bitch what the can we
become 15 again like calm the down
like relax yeah Nene I'm off her I don't
really like her whole ways of thinking
the way she get down I don't like Porsha
I feel like this season Porsha did not
come into her own I feel like Porsha is
still like Nene's a little sidekick
she doesn't necessarily have a mind of
her own she thinks she's doing something
and she's not her voice I don't
necessarily like her singing voice and I
think it's because it's simple fact that
she doesn't have any proper control so
it just sounds like a lot of times it
sounds like hora noise when you're on
the freeway it's just like town like
it's there and you hear it and sometimes
it can be rhythmic other times it could
be horrible keep up the good hair Oh
Kenya uh I'm gonna just go back to Kenya
just individually cuz I do like him yeah
I don't know why people have such an
issue where I think Kenya is doing
exactly what you're supposed to do when
you get on reality TV keep it hot
because without Kenya that show would be
very much boring without the drama
surrounding that she's pretty much
stirring up so I think Kenya definitely
is necessary Cynthia and Peter are
boring and that's pretty much it and I
feel like the season was good I feel
like the people that were doing what
they're supposed to do did it I just
don't like the fact that they're so
young how about very stupid-ass
storylines Bravo like we need to get
some some warship hopping the fact they
went to Savannah and
a trip I mean they ended up going to
Mexico but as that would that y'all
could have bypassed that whole Savannah
trip because it was so unfuckin
necessary like it was just not necessary
help me sure I've been watching this
basketball eyes and I think that it is
very interesting those things of the
fact that I know two of the people on
the show which is Chantel and Jackie all
triangle with Chani and Draya and
Orlando I'm not gonna comment on cuz
yeah the whole situation with Jackie and
everybody else though I feel like Jackie
is doing when she's been doing since in
d1 and that's staying relevant and
that's continues to do what she wants to
do I think Jackie is regardless of how
you feel about her she's still a part of
the show so the girls may change but
Jackie is still gonna remain the same
you know I'm saying so it as long as you
have a familiar face that's caused the
most drama is still there then you is
good you know she's like Beyonce as long
as you change the other girls out the
front singing it will always be the same
so I do like Malaysia I do like brandy
of course I love Draya but I just feel
like especially this season it's it's a
lot of petty and cattiness like Sundy
she's she's she's petty she that's what
it is she's really petty and I didn't
take her for that because last season I
went to the bathroom I Wives reunion and
she was there and she seemed really
sweet and she seemed really cool I
didn't have no interaction with her but
from what I seen she did seem really
cool and I remember her from being on
state property
she said she's okay actress so I mean I
really didn't see her being much of our
drama starter like that but it was very
interesting cuz that black eye she got
was whoo she said somebody hit her hard
god damn just who just slide like you
know and she was like ain't nobody gonna
get in the pool
ain't nobody gonna get in the pool i'ma
get an uncle I was like sending your our
girls problem so Glee it's not cute so
you know as far as Sundy goes I just
think that it's just she's she's messy
Brande Brande school she kind of
straddles the
I understand when she was Hannah Dreher
about the whole friend thing you don't
always want to coffee with your friends
that you are not that cool with yet
because people will be like should you
I've been there I know um
Brittish Brittish Brittish please please
dye your hair black blonde is not for
you
uh your track was showing in one of your
interviews I'm talking to you directly
girl yeah one of your tracks are shown
in your interview that is a problem as a
hair guru as a person who loves weaves
and hairs and all this stuff you get a
huge f+ - violation cuz that is
disrespectful you don't come on national
TV and then since that producers over at
vh1 yachting you say you're British
hair makeup can somebody come up in here
and fix the track like y'all just let
this girl sit on in the camera like this
for you really but I don't like her
attitude I don't really too much care
for that I think um
Lorenzo's cheating on her for sure I
definitely think he's out there he's
smashing something that ain't her so I
don't think that they're gonna get
married period at this particular point
I just don't think that it's gonna
happen blasian Malaysia she's always
gonna be the peacemaker when it comes
down to it but Sundy did put all her
Instagram bet it wasn't Draya that hit
her in the face
it wasn't Malaysia that got her with the
ones who knockout so yeah Drake J that's
what Draya said somebody hit her hard
she didn't say I hit her hard so you
know whatever right yeah I think this
season Draya is a little too hung up on
her boy for her man you know he did me
and my man that's my man
this is me and my man and she said flat
out she's insecure she doesn't trust him
so I think all of those are recipe for
disaster so do I think they're gonna be
together or they're gonna stay together
no because she she can't trust him and
if you are in a relationship and you
can't trust your significant other to
even go down the street and get some
eggs without you thinking he brought to
 somebody then ash shows that no
that's a wrap
so I think it's just a moment thing for
her eventually something's gonna give
she's gonna get fed up and somebody's
gonna really come out and out their
relationship for what it really is and
it's gonna be over so sorry Draya it's
not Orlando it's definitely not Orlando
oh this is why I don't do reviews
because a lot of these people I actually
know so it's a little hard
I don't really care too much about Dance
Moms as far as what's going on
although Abby digging her snatch
this it's a shout out to dance mom Kelly
she got that bitch she needed it
high praise has been very interesting I
love adore Delano and I love Courtney
act
and that's it I mean I like Darien like
there is a little better so and I do
like de la creme I forgot bendelacreme I
do like garbage too but this season I
like to mix up I like to change up good
job
RuPaul for kind of keeping it fresh
because it was trying to get a little
bit stale each season
but yeah overall the show is actually
still very good and still very fresh my
sister's watching it now she loves drag
race so I'm happy to see that that gay
community is actually doing something of
a positive matter and it's actually
interesting and fun so what that's it
then we're pretty much all my reviews
that I got for all the shows I'll
probably do some more of these later but
yeah this is pretty much what I'm
watching right now this is all I'm
watching I do watch scandal I didn't
watch this week's episode yet so I'll
watch it a little bit later but yeah you
have any questions or concerns or would
you widow's any suggestions what do you
know what are you guys watching what do
you guys think I should watch because I
want to know and we'll go from here
so I'll talk to you guys later and I
hope you guys enjoyed this taste</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
