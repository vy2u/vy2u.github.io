was going off about at once minute well
what was she not doing it okay well in
the beginning what she really wasn't it
wasn't drama neutral and neutral I'll
get you in no cameras on so that's why
in the beginning she had all that drama
with our manager right but then that
back faded because the unicum Bella and
Erica getting into it and yeah yeah
and Christy and you have um Jones and
Christy inning hedge gym and it was just
it was a lot niggas right so I'm

really good good and on top of all that
all day and we still and I still got
mother 80% and I've been on
Twitter Facebook at everything
Oh girlfriend you gotta get a good say
okay so let me tell you about my phone
okay first of all this is the best phone
of 2010 and what you're we that's
exactly my point
so if this is the best phone of 2010
just imagine what they're gonna release
in 2012 - Megan playing whatever
but in 2010 that was hot actually no it
wasn't because the iPhone in 2010 was at
8 megapixels then the front-facing yes
well that that's neither here nor there
okay
why does he bring it up there are
certain
that this thought has that this phone
does not have wit his way well not on
this one he's my navigation when I got
is here right now okay so tell me what's
better than yo following we didn't got
off the subjects are we gonna get back
to TV because we're not talking about
phones this is a good phone you guys
show any like you want me to get this
far huh
and I will show you the hotness of the
phone when I got it I'm actually vid we
about to Apple Valley took it we troll
like we was going to face
used to get that raggedy-ass phone we
drove hot in a summer bit hot it was
built like right out to the photos
release actually it was like two weeks
of did Wisconsin me everybody's I'm on
my way I'm on my way we would I drove
like I never would have been in Vegas
just to get a phone when she broke that
shoe twice put me up bitch cuz you
talking should have our
phone but just spend money on every
 anyway so another reality
show that I like I can't draw wise it's
been good Asian all over them hoes is
but I mean maybe we're doing that last
season some no no way for what you when
you broke your jaw oh he does everything
when he broke your jaw yeah that's what
I did that whole little disclaimer at
the right committed suicide so if y'all
watch The Real Housewives Melanie ah
don't we talk on it's not yeah I need to
get on that she the marathon's come on
every week so yeah cuz the first two
episodes are kind of wack that's why but
that's because they were trying to deal
with his alienate him promote
shown that much because of the fact he
committed suicide so therefore it wasn't
really promoting because it's like they
were you know oh yeah I can't wait till
next season
yeah they might do it back-to-back
seasons hopefully cause that is too
good
um the bride sees the Braxtons still
good I kind of caught up the other day
the Bryson's I have to say is a good
show the only gripe that I have with the
show is a simple fact that there's not
enough Tony too much Tamar and it's too
much extra I can do a her for about five
minutes and then between the wigs all of
that like bitch do you have to wear that
much blush really that you
just woke up like that bitch me like
about ten minutes but girl it ain't that
G chick in their life and then every
time she busts one of these one of these
bitch we seen all your lace we spent all
your no edges so you need to kill all of
that okay I got my edges yeah yes so the
Braxtons is cool and I'm saying - Wanda
I'm still questioning her you know her
gender because I don't know
so Honda looks like a woman like our
body is giving it her body for me our
face is like I don't know what I'm
saying like you know you meet somebody
let me have that look on a face where
like you see a certain image and name
you'd be like the bitch just looked like
rude like I know when you complain it
