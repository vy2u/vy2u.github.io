Oh
today we're gonna talk about Meehan my
my email me or is from Rick cool riku
[Laughter]
what is it
almost work like in the morning I'm a
little to lose you I mean delirious see
so this hair that I'm wearing is from
rakul hair right don't this is like a
remix of Angela but it's like Angela 2.0
okay for y'all who better to ask me my
Jackie any cute though and it's from the
mosquito boutique line which is like a
cheaper option for mosquito it's still
mosquito but it's kind of like the hmm
like that okay um and then as you can
see I have a mosquito bracelet and in my
earrings are the signature mosquito
layers so I feel like this was really
cute but this hair is from Rico hair and
and this is can you guys guess what it
is
Brazilian straight uh-huh does that mean
this just why not right and I am rock
whoa I was rocking three bundle four
bundles of 32 clearly she is no more 32
and she's a little crooked okay and then
my frontal is a 13 by 4 lace frontal
that is 22 inches so a little bit behind
like why I decided not to actually keep
my hair the length that it was the
reason was I had no really reason I
requested the hair
I don't remember requesting 32 inches I
believe they suggested it and then you
know anything over 28 I'm always like
absolutely but then reality kind of
kicked in for me and I had to I was
shooting something and I needed some
like very pretty hair that was just like
very quaffed and very perfect and very
to the point and that was too long and
when I curled it
and gave you a curl but it didn't sit
like this like this sitting is she
sitting pretty honey she has a she has
dimension she has body she has Shawn she
has you know all of the great things you
need in a moment and my hair being that
long was just at that point especially
coming off the 60 inch hair calling me
crazy but I was over it I was legit over
it so I decided to cut it so now it's
probably like a 20 I know 26 it is curl
so keep that in mind as well but it's
like a good 26 and I actually love this
hair because it holds a curl and the the
thing that I hate the most about
straight here is that a lot of times as
you guys already know it does not hold a
curl and a lot of times my hair like
this will just simply not hold it will
be a wave in the morning these I went
back I record this bank piece here in
the front and I went ahead and curl this
piece right here the rest it is has just
business and I just left it as such so
imma get some stuff
so y'all could see what I'm talking
about oh look at the dimension we get up
it'll like a video you know so I like
this new lighting setup it was an
accident but it totally works for me so
I really do like this looks so good like
I'm living in twirling and then twirling
and then living again girlfriend oh yes
oh yes she's there she's there she has a
belt too you know and it just definitely
gives you like our B girl
b-boy type of feel to it that's why I
opted in for no shirt and I'm saying but
I can't say for color this seemed like
it would lift like - a nice color that
you would like it wouldn't say
completely blonde but definitely very
blond s it you know a nice I feel like
it you tone that you can get it to an
ash blonde I just wouldn't say a
six-thirty no I don't think baby imma be
honest I'm gonna heart get here
I don't think maybe is 6:13 worthy I
don't think you can get it to there
without making the hair dry that kind of
I feel like you can get there but you
might get there and it might just be
mush so I would say keep it high light
wise the other video that I just did
perfect part not the highlight part but
just the brownish you know color that
would be really really cute if you did
that but I wouldn't go any further than
that as far as cutting goes and the
density of the hair which I don't talk
about often which is crazy because
that's my main thing but this hair is
very full but it's not too full it's not
mink fold it's just full you know it
gives you what you need it has a lot of
body it has a lot of movement all of
that that it gives you that I feel like
a woman
Oh chronological woman but a woman
nonetheless from like the 90s because my
jacket has the big shorter path I feel
like I'm into man I feel like I could
tell you what's going on wrong in your
life probably the lie to you and get
your check but I'm telling you you know
so that's what this look is giving and
it's definitely very nineties you know
it definitely has a very that's why what
is something that was very um easy and
breezy and beautiful and it moved as far
as my fronts will go so here's the thing
okay my frontal is literally coming over
my ear like this because I wasn't paying
attention and I made it on the cap
without cutting the ear parts off so now
I'm just yeah yeah she she she she can't
give you behind the ear realness no no
no and that's my father not the
company's father how about that okay
then the other day so today I put it on
I was on FaceTime with my homegirl put
it on glued it down
if this ain't glued down by the way so
you see the parties on this side I'm
sure y'all like something's a little bit
different you guys normally my part is
on this side so I opted to do something
different not paying attention laughing
at her I put the wig on like this so
this part was over here that means that
this part was back here
it looks so cute until you come like
when I was like this though you could
tell honey she was so uneven it wasn't
even a look I mean it was it was no way
I could have done that video and said oh
look at my hair and you couldn't see
that my hair was like this there's no
way so I had to take it off clean the
lace off and it is 357 in the morning so
yeah I will have to say this is my first
time working with very cool hair they
were really recalled they weren't really
cool because this was to be up last week
and they were very understanding to the
fact that I I just technology has
definitely not been my friend for the
last like month or so and they were very
understanding and they sent me some
really good hair I want to know what you
guys if you guys do buy this hair again
I had 434 432 s and a 22 inch searching
my for frontal and if you guys do buy
this hair please tag me in it I love
when you guys do that and say hey I
brought this hair and it was braum I
love it because it lets me know which
companies to continue to work with and
what companies not to work with anymore
because the one thing that I don't want
to do is continue to work with the
company to send you guys back hair I
don't want to do that so when you do buy
hair from whatever company and you love
it or you don't love it please tag me in
it because it lets me know how I can
best serve you guys because these
reviews are not really about me I'm just
here to do what I do and bow the hair
and give you 90s realness and won't let
you know crawl her up oh no girl no
little air I got done is somebody close
it mm-hmm alright and you know do what I
do and report to you guys of what I feel
is affordable for you guys I don't
always tell you guys and all my other
reviews this hair is not long term here
this is very short term here this is a
very to the point here if you plan to
wear this hair every single day if you
get a long wear out of it
if you do not go you spend a couple of
hundred dollars and you got more than
you would get for that price then you
would probably get for a bundle I've
been looking for some 60-inch 6:13 hair
and it has been like literally trying to
find Stevie Wonder's hair line girl
struggle so if you guys are interested
in recall hair make sure you guys put
you guys hit the links down below let me
know if you guys like this look if is
this giving you um MTV Veejay that's
what I feel like I feel so I really do
like this looks so good like I'm living
and twirling and then twirling and then
living again girlfriend oh yes oh yes
she's there she's there she has a belt
too you know and it just definitely
gives you like our B girl
