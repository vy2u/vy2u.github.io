quality of this video because I'm using
my iPad again because my phone today
okay so basically this topic is called I
want a relationship light and basically
this is for all the people on Twitter
and Facebook Instagram who always like
you know it's thing on Facebook like
like if you know who this was couple
lives are like if you want a
relationship like this person and the
thing that I don't understand about the
shit is the simple fact that most of the
people who are liking and comment and
posting can't even be in a relationship
for fucking two weeks so how the fuck
can you say I want a relationship like
jay-z and Beyonce when your
motherfucking eyes don't even you you
can't even act like Ren and Stimpy
okay what I don't understand is that as
a individual when you get with someone
in a relationship you have to understand
that there's a lot that goes in a
relationship between between having sex
and actually getting to know each other
there's like a big gap there where you
have to actually work you're not I'm
saying like it's not all about that it's
oh well I want to fuck with him because
he's sexy I want to fuck with her cause
she's working when we gonna get just
working in a minute because I doesn't
know how you catch your man that's how
you catch a boy well you can say that in
a second um what I do not understand and
I don't agree with because I think it's
like very petty it's a simple fact that
people sit back and they use these
people's relationships as blueprints is
what they should do however you can't
put that blueprint to everybody that you
meet one because everybody is different
- you have to understand that if you
mess with one guy or one girl or both
whatever you choose um then you have to
understand that it is very sorry to not
mess with people within the same circle
because it just makes you look like a
hug okay that's just first off you look
like a big asshole so then you have
people sitting back whoa I want to do
this and I want to do that and I know
I'm gonna be famous because I'm cute now
you guys know recently Kerry Rhodes
of the football player his little jump
off dude who look like Fantasia decided
that he wanted to come out and say all
this about Carrie Oh me and Carrie were
together and he tried to play me and
this is why I came out and said this is
that any other now there's a lot of
people I know who want to be in the
industry there's a lot of people who
want to just date industry dudes because
they want to get what they want and go
to go do to do and say they had sex with
whomever I'm gonna give you a little
chair do not give with someone and tell
all of their business and the you expect
people to continue to date you cuz that
you've already fucked a bad little boy
and he swears he is the finest thing
since sliced bread with his funny
looking ass and I'm let me talk to my
gays for a second okay let's just talk
to the gays for a second because the gay
relationships I've seen so many
beautiful gay relationships but I've
seen so many fucked-up relationships
play out on Facebook and Twitter where
it's not even funny like you guys should
be ashamed of yourself
now if you're going with someone or you
you're somebody side piece or you jump
off you guys need to know how to play
your position don't expect further ado
to wife you and be what she went by you
this and actually go in public with you
and only reason why he's fuckin with you
is because you're his dirty little
secret don't expect for you to get a
level higher and be like are where he
gonna make me buy he you know he's not
chicks to no he's not because if you are
presenting yourself as a whole and I
think you good for it's laying on your
back that's the only thing that you're
gonna you don't have a relationship you
have an arrangement there is a
difference a dude that I saw the way I'm
gonna make sure I'm gonna be on a red
carpet with you were gonna do interviews
together they're gonna know my
motherfucking name and if we cannot do
that then we can not fuck around I don't
give a fuck what you got or what you can
find me I could buy myself whatever the
fuck I want a lot of you bitches is
thirsty out when he brought me red
bottoms so your pussy is only worth some
$800 rambabu's and your shit ain't worth
nothing no value bitch I ain't even one
K damn like y'all need to understand
your worth as an individual your worth
if your coochie booty dick whatever the
fuck sorry for being graphic but I'm
just
on us right now you guys need to
evaluate yourself at a higher standard
these days for things like that if you
why the fuck are you fucking for red
bottoms but you still broke that makes
no sense to me you fucking for red
bottoms but you're still broke you still
not you still not at that point in life
where you wanna be you still
club-hopping room - floor - you have no
steady income you have no steady nothing
you're just floating through life oh but
you got a pair red body so you are bad
but you're gonna Instagram the
motherfucker sitting orange at the
bottom right right and that's what this
little boy kept saying I was driving his
rose rides and I was had on red bottoms
and I have a 29 inch waist well I have a
24 inch waist so what you saying though
like boom dude and I know we just forgot
small oasis in me like what does that
mean butts and a lot of people are
checked date these celebrities for
monetary compensation in game o K Rhodes
he just got 100 manali you know I'm
saying type of situation well he came to
me yeah whether he came to you or not
and I would be very honest right now
there are people that I've been linked
to that I have data and they're people
who I've been linked to that I have not
dated whose business that that's our
business then I'm not gonna go out of my
way to tell anybody else who I had sex
with or who I dated because that's no
one else's business
you have another said no one's gonna be
able to trust you ever if you go off
talking about who fucked you and who
gave you what but and that's gonna
always be on your track record so
whenever you get into a relationship
whether he's famous or just a regular
old Joe you gonna always have this like
that's like getting the spell from
school that's gonna follow you forever
you know I'm saying our school loans
that follows you forever trust me
unknown
um so it stuff like that that people
need to understand and take into mind
and relationships their work you don't
get into someone he got a BMW and he
make this amount of mine and he give me
this and he said hey what about me that
and did you do it you don't that's not
how you get into a relationship that's
how you get into an arrangement that's
how hos work you never saying are you a
ho you claim you not to be a ho but
you're doing very whole like activity
therefore it claims to me you seem to be
like a ho you know working in general
it's very gratifying when you learn what
you want to do and how to get it yeah
I'm saying have your own never happens
to ask somebody I don't feel as an adult
I should ever have to ask anybody for
anything whether it's a card a pair of
pants a pair of red bottoms or some hair
it don't matter
I'm gonna get my own shit the way I need
to get it you know I'm saying and the
right way to get it I'm not gonna rely
on some man to give it to me and a lot
of y'all don't want to work his the
bitches is lazy
everybody's a makeup artist and
everybody's a motherfucking model and
everybody's our choreographer and
everybody that's cute and I commend you
for doing something with yourself
however you should want to do more with
yourself that should not be where your
shit sidewalk you know I'm beating faces
like a motherfuckin III just can't touch
me these bitches can't do shit about me
nobody knows you bitch
like come on now like everybody this all
I'm saying is when you get into a
relationship with somebody and you want
to move forward and have something great
and you want all these fairytales and
the shit that you see on TV this could
be you and you my dear could happen if
your ass will act right cuz ain't no man
going down a hole ain't no man gonna
fuck with a bitch you ain't got shit
ain't no man gonna wanna be with
somebody who run a fucking mouth with
just no filter like no filter whether
you sign an agreement not to talk or not
is beside the point
you should have more morals as an
individual just sayin
so I mean it's up to you whether you you
know you want to be that person or you
still want to be that hoe now it's a lot
of people out here it's working I know
some people who be twerking on the
internet that's cuter and I can twerk I
just don't do it in public
cuz I think it is tacky and only dudes
who like ever do ones to date you based
off that and he only wants to have sex
with you that's it no man wants a little
girl or a woman who works or a gay dude
who twerks besties I mean you can forego
you want just don't do that shit in
public post mess you don't lie
I'm thinking uh Scootaloo ass booty
shorts half-ass naked no man wants to
date that no man will share his goods
with the world so you sitting back
thinking at your little shit is cute and
you're gonna really gain something from
any because you got horny old ass men
some young ass thirsty little dudes
hitting you're talking about some always
good you know you look good no you
should want to do Stu want you for this
not this all this all that and you know
that's not cute y'all don't value young
like this generation does not value
their self and they're worth for shit at
all like I've seen some of the grossest
disrespectful shit come out of and being
half the nerve to talk about some K none
of these bitches Fame mean K none of
these bitches fuck with me trust me you
are in a lane all your own ain't nobody
trying to fuck with you okay so when you
get into the mindset that you want to be
with somebody make sure that it's
worthwhile in your doing it because you
like the person you want to get to know
the person and build a life with the
person not for monetary gain or the fact
that you want to have sex with them or
the fact that you want to try and get to
somebody through them cuz that's not
cute that does not work that's not gonna
get you anywhere and people who have
that mindset don't get far in life
cuz you're gonna get burnt out real
quick in every type of way so yeah just
make sure when you're with someone
you're with them for the right reasons
and not the wrong reasons if you choose
to live your life the way that you live
in it and you choose to be disrespectful
and use people for what they have then
when you finally get something
somebody's gonna do you the very same
way and you don't think that that person
loves you and ain't caring about you you
would do anything for them and they use
your ass just like you use somebody who
actually give a fuck about you I'm just
saying I'm just being honest karma is
very real and it is a big bitch so I
would suggest people out here especially
my gays make sure that what you're doing
you're gonna build a career upon it
don't sell your ass and sell your soul
sell your talent cuz that's what gets
you money
and all that no I'm out bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
