so this hair no can we pull it off so
you can get the gist of their good ol is
okay this is not long is long okay with
the cave huh
so this hair is from from rose hair on
go I'll express now a lot of you guys
have said that you guys really want me
to do some straight hair some shrimp
Brazilian hair that's long so why not
so this hair actually received around
the holiday time so I believe it was
like around November possibly that I got
this hair November October I got this
hair and I've had it every since I was
going to originally be Morticia Addams
for Halloween and then I totally change
to Sheriff and clueless when their
that's the reason why I requested this
length hair because I wanted it to be
this nice middle part sleek I mean it is
for that um but this nice sleek long
hair because of course Morticia has no
layers
nothing her hair's just dead straight
and I wanted that so I've had this hair
and have been wearing it pointed off
since then now I haven't worn this hair
as much as I have my other ones because
this is not a realistic length for
everyday but I did have a photo shoot
where I was you know had a lot of wind
going on till there my Beyonce oats and
I'm I wore this hair and then I also
worried when I went to it was something
recently that I worked for so I wanted
to guy wanted to give you guys like a
thorough review because long hair is
very different from short hair and long
hair have a tendency to shed a lot
because you sit on it and it gets caught
in the elements so I am currently
rocking four bundles of 28-inch and my
closure is actually 28 inches as well so
this is where my closure is now it looks
like a shorter
a layer here because it's at the top of
my head so therefore all of my layers in
the back I mean all of my tracks in the
back they start back here so of course
it would not be the exact same I can you
know I could cut it but it actually has
this natural layer can see the rest of
these is all one but this particular
layer because it's at the top of my head
it seems as if I have like somewhat of a
layer right here but that's fine because
it still looks like it's all one get
down now to my bundles one of my bundles
shedded like a mangy dog and I don't
know what it was I don't know if it was
just a bad bundle I don't know what it
was but that one bundle shed it so I had
to steal that one the rest of these are
not sealed and I got a lot of questions
from a lot of people who were asking me
um what it means to steal your wealth
what you do is you take this stuff in
there's a lot of wig and weak companies
sell it as well and what they do is they
take it and you can put it on the actual
web part and it will stop the terror of
the hair from coming out the actual web
of the actual track so that's what that
means you're just pretty much gonna put
something a sill it in there to seal the
wefts and still the track in which the
hair is coming from so that it will not
come out when you do this and see I have
no hair now sometimes what ends up
happening is as you continue to do that
then the wet part gets a little weaker
and the hair starts to slip out of it
and again
extensions are something that are
man-made it's not a natural thing so a
machete the Machine tie or hand tied
just depends sometimes if it's not done
correctly then you will start to get a
lot of shedding if it gets hot in the
inner kitchen it starts to kind of
network on you and then it becomes a bit
too much so that's what silly us mean so
I still that one bit or bundle which was
my middle bundle and the rest of my
bundles are just completely wet still it
free and then I have a lace closure that
I went ahead and put some concealer on
so that it will look nice and
and nice and you know straight and it
still has a little bit of a lace right
here as you can see because I just
wanted it to have this I don't want to
really leave none of my widow's peak out
with this because I wanted you guys to
see how we possibly look on you most
people don't have a little speak so you
know the hair itself is very flowy I
remember taking it out of the package
because I have to do my wig because I
got my costume so I have to happen to my
wig and I remember it being super duper
straight it does this now they say this
is some Brazilian straight virgin hair
and I want to believe that it's virgin
but I'm also believing that it may be
something else because it is
ridiculously straight it's pet hair
straight and most Packer you guys though
its processed so I don't know how virgin
this hair is I did do my girl strand
test with this to kind of see if it
turned and it definitely I could bleach
this and I actually wanted what I want
to do is I want to bleach up to about
here blonde and I want to make this like
a nice baby blue so it's gonna be a
little ratchet but you guys will see
what it's for and then you're gonna get
my my madness but it actually did bleach
it actually did turn and and now the
reason why I love it is because it's not
my typical thick it's very sleep it's
not crazy thick and it is for a bundle I
haven't had any snags I haven't had any
issues after I filled him with shedding
at all it has a nice luster to it
although this is not the natural luster
that came in the hair actually put a
product in his hair because I wanted it
to be as about as sleek and it's
straight as possible and I was not gonna
get that with the regular straightness
that it was it did not however take me
um an act of Congress to get this part
and to get my um
closure to lay down which usually I'll
notice what a lot of my Aliexpress hair
this ends up being the problem well you
can't really get this to lay down flat
like this it's because it's so thick and
sometimes they crowd their closures
where you have to really do some plugin
and it's this whole thing
we have to try to make it work so I have
not done that however I am SuperDuper
suggesting this hair for anybody who
wants some long stripper hair and you
cannot really afford it for from a
probably a us-based company the price
for this is very very very very
affordable and from what I see from his
hair only thing I would say to you guys
if you are considering purchasing and
purchasing these hair is do not wear
this as a weave wear it as a wig because
this hair is ridiculously long and after
a while you start to want to wrap it you
want to put it in a bun you want to
start to do things that's gonna probably
cause the hair to start wanting to not
act right with you and again it's hair
you should be able to do what you want
with it but I don't think people
understand hair is one thing super long
hair is a completely different beast and
if you are not alone first and what to
do you end up with a very unfortunate
situation a lot of times you guys asked
me about what products that I use in the
hair I use my beyond the zone Flatiron
spray in this and then I use some Chi
hair spray to go ahead and Flatiron to
make sure it was so straight with a
state sleep now
I also tend to use when I wash my
bundles because I do wash his hair quite
a few times because I ended up I wore it
I had one out and I ate and I got a soy
sauce just but got some soy sauce at the
bottom of my hair and it stunk so I had
to wash my hair quite a few times to get
that smell out but what I do use for a
lot of times for my straight hair I
would like to use the because I have
milk from organics that works great on
straight hair for me and I use the
matching shampoo as well because what
you got understand is you don't want to
put like a shampoo that's for curly hair
and your straight here it's not gonna do
anything to affect it really bad but the
thing is sometimes because whenever the
agents are the ingredients that are in
that particular shampoo whether it be
whatever it will start to want to make
the hair a little poofy what you don't
want because it is
takes you longer you're putting more
heat on the hair you're causing the heat
you know I'm saying you're causing more
damage to the hair that you really want
it to be so try something usually thing
that's a smooth and silk or something
anything was smooth in a name as far as
shampoo goes and conditioner usually
works great on straight hair if you got
curly hair I would say anything that has
anything like curl definer or anything
like that
just do not get cheap brands aussies a
good brand fordable brand even swab just
not dollar suave don't do that
but even suave is actually a good
alternative especially for a lot of my
Aliexpress here I don't use like my
Giovanni shampoo or my bio silk I don't
use that on my Aliexpress hair because I
feel like the hair is not really worth
that type of product because anything a
little cheaper will be okay now if I'm
getting hair that is pre color pre
lighting whatever then I will use
something a little more expensive only
because I want to make sure nothing
happens and I think the hair is soft as
possible without ruining the natural
texture
whatever that touch you might be in it
so again my luscious inches look check
that check okay so yeah if you guys are
interested in this hair um and you just
want it for whatever reason you could
actually give this hair you know if you
want to be ghetto about it put a little
ponytail and then wrap your ponytail
with these bundles and you just that
type of girl or that type of boy but
I'll put the info below for you guys
shoutouts or Ross hair from being very
patient with me for their review um I've
been testing out this hair and I'm
taking much longer I'm giving myself
like another extra 30 days for a lot of
my reviews now because I just want to
you guys it's much thorough possibility
with this hit with these wigs in these
extensions as possible so please be
patient I love you guys and I'll catch
you guys in my next one
