it's like back to you know I've been
having side part withdrawals because
I've been wearing a lot of middle parts
and y'all know I feel about that oh but
I feel back to myself again you know I
feel like cool again so this week that I
have one is from RPG show and this wig
is there Kim Kardashian wig and I know
I've had a few leagues like this from
RPG show but there's something different
about this one and that's because RPG
show has up their density y'all it ain't
thin though Bo so I'll give you the
specs on this wig and all of the info
you know the little info that I found
out about it as I laid it down
um but you may you may not like alright
cuz I just want to give my information
right because y'all know how I'll be
trying to like wing it and then I'll be
all wrong so um this this is there are
stock Kim Kardashian full lace human
hair wig which is TLV 1920 - edge so
when it's a stock wig that means that
they're already ready to ship you don't
have to wait for them to be done unless
they run out but this is a stock week
it's 20 inches which it is true to
length because y'all know I do not like
to wear my hair this short but it is
it's it's much easier especially coming
off 34 inches this feels like a breeze
you know it's cool it's silky texture my
lace color is a light brown my cap
construction is a cap 3 which is the
glueless cap the cap size is a 1 and
remember if you never like if you don't
like the wigs never cut the lace off
just in the back um there are three
combs there is one in the middle and
then there's two on the side and there's
one in the back
no there's not one in the back there's
an adjustable strap so you know that's
cool it's it's not as full as I thought
it was gonna be when I said it was up in
a density I thought it was gonna be like
crazy fool but it is realistic fool
meaning it has a you know more of a
realistic look I wish I would have
grabbed one of my older wigs so you guys
can kind of see the density of that one
in this one it's a difference it's like
the density went up like by 15% but it's
not like a huge difference but this is
very realistic this is what my hair
looks like when it's flat iron and
straighten you know it has a very
natural look to it it's not crazy full
like I'm used to um but it is a natural
black so it has a natural color to it I
didn't put when I flat ironed it I
didn't put any product in it cuz I guys
I wanted you guys to see the luster cuz
see if I do this like okay so look at
the hair now right okay
this is what it looks like with just the
natural luster in it but then when I
take my favorite heat protectant spray
and I put it I'm going to show you guys
how much gloss it adds to already
straight here okay now once I take that
and I do this and then of course at this
point I was flat ironing it will look
like more like this so as you can see
the it's much shinier on this side than
it is on this side but if you did this
this little clump right here wouldn't be
here you obviously the heat would
dissipate the amount of shine that's in
the hair but pretty much that's what it
would do to make you look really really
really silky and really straight and
really like pin straight that's pretty
much what it would do but it's not
really nothing different about this wig
there my other ones I haven't really
stated I've got no shedding as I
shouldn't because it's a straight unit
so it was easier to flat iron versus
like you know wavy hair or curly hair
it's it came straight um
the parting now usually when I get an
RPG show wink it's already pre parted
but Kim's hair was in the photo that
they use I think she had a middle part I
think she had a middle part so this was
kind of like a free-flowing situation so
I had to really go in and impress it and
you know all the things that I usually
do there's a video on my channel about
what to do when you get a first wig so
that I had to do that in order to keep
it in this particular style but again
I wanted a side part because I haven't
had one in like a minute because I've
been wearing a heck out of my you know
my nice flowy hair which I will be doing
a tutorial on by the way so yeah this is
my wig it's nothing special nothing that
you guys haven't heard before but I did
want to do this review because I just
want to let you guys know they did up
their density and it does show that
they're trying and that's a good thing
it's like when a company takes the
initiative to say okay maybe we are
sitting out not enough hair it does move
because I run my other units especially
when they get longer and it's not a lot
of hair it looks really bad because it's
like you have thirty two inches of thin
and it's not attractive it's not selling
the gag so yeah again it's all lace it's
not a subtype which I don't know if our
PG show has some top wigs if you guys do
please correct me but I don't think that
they carry many still top units which I
would like for them to do because you
guys know how I really just don't like
lace like it just does not look natural
to me I mean I have to use concealer and
all of that good stuff which I don't
like to do because it's more one work
and two if you get this close to my
scalp you don't see I got holes right
there you know but if you're not a
person that that bothers them much then
this will be okay with you book to me
I just prefer still top over lace any
day that's just what I like so yeah okay
Charlie next one so yeah I'll talk to
y'all later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
