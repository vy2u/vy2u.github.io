no we're gonna talk about with it today
me this videos gonna be do you hear
yourself
and basically it's we say things as
people that I don't think that we get
until somebody brings it up or you
realize after like damn that just didn't
really sound too great to say if you
know yo self or me some some people are
just I'm so perfect I'm so Bom Bom
Island yeah but you don't understand the
magnitude of things that you're saying
until basically you realize them or
they're brought up such as and we get
this shit all the time
what the fuck does this mean you are too
cute to be gay Ali huh
what are you saying what did that mean
no I'll be cleared everyone thank you
ma'am I mean just fucking bomb I mean
what exactly does that mean how do you
say that girls I love y'all to death hey
I love y'all to death
but that statement it's also wrong and
also offensive and also disrespectful
because that means that you're saying
you probably don't get it cuz you didn't
mean it in this way but that's what you
said and I can only go by what you say
it's amazing that you said in so many
words because I'm gay I'm a waste
and you know what I've had some I said
it to me too oh yeah you said some ways
it's bitch I know but this isn't thing I
don't live it out or if you like a
finite thing alright and they gave me
back man all that material Gong you can
have the ugly one
this one okay take those the nigga still
rocks on the side of the corner you can
have them I don't wanna and I also don't
like when girls have the tendency to say
man if you was in gated things I would
do I would have you oh well maybe with
you
I don't want you're like their girl no
because that's like me going through a
female and sing it
you are not cute enough in a tears
though you know you ain't that cutie pie
that hairs there to be straight to butch
to be straight you got to you want to
get to to be smashed
you woke to have a car are you have to
good to be wearing a dress
really bitch how would you you are too
wrinkly from injuries yeah you know this
you can don't you can't say stuff like
that and think it's okay and then people
have that in there there you're a
regular mind like that's okay myself
yeah they just okay with it because no
one said anything about it and that's
the environment in which they come from
and then they think that that's okay
just like people the african-american
community think it's okay to be down gay
african-americans like it's okay but
then they asked be dipping and diving
and everybody else's bad and their mamas
apartment or whatever with the nigga
dentistry that's at home because they be
smoking and we know right but you know
right and in also I don't like this
statement why you act in
fill-in-the-blank usually we hear she
acts black or here why are you talking
like okay
and the reason
I brought this up is because first off
that's disrespectful to anybody if you
see someone who is Caucasian and she's
urban that doesn't mean she's acting
black that means that she's acting her
environment we are all products of our
environment okay we have our good
moments because we were murdered
I go to Hollywood and I'm serving a
conservative and at what people consider
Hollywood to be right we can do that
okay but we know our environment and we
know in which we come from so someone
whose connotation that he was brought up
in the hood or he was brought up around
a lot of urban or an individual who they
kick you late yeah they're going to
adapt to you can't say that and it when
all honesty that statement is not true
due to the simple fact that every white
person does not act the same and every
black person doesn't understand order to
act a certain way every person and that
race would have to act like that in
order for that statement to be true
because like I say you act like a bird
all birds are pretty much the same they
have different things about a little
different but they're pretty much the
same I say you act like a sidewalk just
flat all sidewalks are pretty much the
same but a little bit of difference here
and there so in order to say stuff like
you act like you act white Mexican you
know it has to be truth for every person
within that race that act like that so
watch what you say when you say that
because every black person does not have
rhythm every black person can't dance
every black person is not urban and
every Caucasian person is not vice versa
I know some people who are Caucasian
Italian whatever they can did they ask
off and I'm gonna get quiche from up the
street in order to miss you can do is
walk grind with Tyrone that's it yeah oh
she could shake that ass
Mooji learned that at 12 ym was
perfecting it in for so you know but I'm
just saying just just watch what you say
because when you do stuff like that you
exclude yourself from other people and
they don't want to be around you because
they
feel like because I know people who say
it was one person in particular we were
out and he was like it's a lot of white
people in here and I'm getting nervous
you know I was tripping out like you
know like in love with everybody you
know and he was just like I'm not used
to it just like okay you know you can't
if it's a lot of african-americans in
here and you may be Caucasian don't feel
nervous you know of the fact or whatever
I mean I got off subjects but basically
the only off subject real quick okay
people feel they feel that gaze and the
choice something buddy
if I mean if it's a choice for me to be
gay you know wait stop we gonna make
that a whole new video after this mm-hmm
we gonna cover that for a whole ten
minutes well yeah uh what's another one
that they people people think oh here's
one
they say that all Asian people can't
drive that's the stereotype cuz I see
people on the road a family member I'm
not gonna say which one it was but then
nobody was we were in the car and I was
driving and it was a black girl on the
side of me and it was an Asian guy in
front of me the act the black girl went
to merge into the in front of the asian
guy and she did it
disrespectfully but she just basically
Bogart on her way in front of him so he
may see least slow down so the person
into which I was in the car with was
like dang Asians cannot drive like and I
was like that wasn't even his fault that
was her fault because she Bogart in her
way in the front of him and he didn't
even see her
she did it so quickly and it's just
stuff like that is you saying you is a
stereotype and people so used to saying
it just like I don't want to say this
cuz this really mean well I hear all
that especially in LA cuz we have so
many Hispanics in LA but when something
happens like your buddy units do I
always say that it never fails because
it was one time boy oh I'm gonna say it
was a car accident
it was a manic I hit right in front of
y'all it was so traumatic Allegra's
broke his shoe flew it like a halfway
down the street and then the girl sped
off but she came back she had back
issues better cuz she was scared but uh
it was basically why stand or whatever
like never stood near my house or
whatever it was a collision and a
Caucasian one man hit a Mexican guy she
hit him he did not hit her so it's you
know it's a lot of african-americans in
this area that's all you hear
motherfuckin hit him motherfuckers this
shit nigga came try work the
motherfucker
why don't they give them licenses and
shit nigga fuckin up cars and shit it
alright cuz we I think the accident
happened and I'm just thinking to myself
like she don't know what she talking
about she just talked you know and he
just makes you look ignorant you know at
the end of the day it just makes you
look really incredibly inner ignorant um
but yeah just the magnitude of the
things that you say you have to
basically realize that because it can't
be very offensive towards people and man
right and I'm too cute to be gay bitch
but I need to accuse the bush you in
your shit uh-huh I miss keeping it real
death a year wrong uh-huh you be keeping
me sober I so real so no it was so real
where'd you win yesterday oh what fun
mhm I can get on this car from you yes

my messages via an icon she really
