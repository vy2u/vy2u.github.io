just because you guys I just keep
getting a lot of messages about people
like when you go to another rant video
where you go so I'm gonna start off with
a little boozy cuz he just a bitch-ass
nigga with bitch-ass nigga tendencies
and I just don't I don't so Disney
Channel post
well they had a cartoon I don't watch
the Disney Channel anymore Ivan watch
the Disney Channel since vessel Raven so
I don't really watch him
however model my sister does she still
watches I like Girl Meets World and
stuff like that and I know that there
was a I think it was like sunny with a
chances I don't know they had two gay
parents okay and as you probably know
now that implementing gay qualities and
you know children's television is going
on so you can call it what you want but
what I will say is that as a person who
is gay I am happy to see that the
representation is not just about sex cuz
what do people always think that gay
people are about is just six but I'm
just really over the the the people
especially the black people complaining
about stupid shit we are dealing with a
whole bunch of other shit award and then
you got fucking low-budget as rappers
complaining so little Uzi decided to say
this is why I don't let my kids and
watch this shit let me dress like this
okay every time it seems like there's a
gay issue little boozy always seems like
his motherfucking name is just right
next to it it's just gay and boozy gay
boozy and I don't understand it's all
this fucking pussy in the world and you
forever got a motherfucking dick in your
mouth I don't did it are you gay do you
want to be part of the clan what is it
because at this point I can't I don't
understand it's not just him it with
these these so-called macho a pretty
so-called big bang tank rappers always
ambitious the game wrote a whole fuckin
soliloquy about Meek Mill if you don't
like the
why in the fuck are you writing this you
are that big of a fan of Nicki Minaj are
you then your bar and you are told get
you a bar BJ's who like I don't
understand why is it that people want to
look and have an issue and nitpick with
every fucking thing that's going on okay
but then nobody said nothing when Ariel
kiss Eric that's bestiality bitch if you
want to be technical or nobody had an
issue when oh is it one of these bitches
is 14 I did the programming I think the
real program is wasn't that young or was
she nor shoot the rumble I feels like 12
or some shit like that
I don't remember I'm not really up on my
Disney Princesses like that but what I
will say is it seems like every time I
look up it's like this is okay and
that's not okay
if it does is not in line with your
children's and that's fine but let me
just let me just make this very clear
the thing about adults that really
irritate me is they don't give kids
enough Chris when I was all of the age
of fucking six and seven and eight
I was doing more than just fucking
kissing in a cubby hole at school okay
your ass most of the bitches in talking
shit in the comments most of you bitches
with teen mothers by the age of 14 and
you would teen mothers of two and a
single mother by the age of 16 so what
the fuck are you talking about this is
what I mean is just always oh this is
the issue and that's not the issue so
we're going to let that go just ready to
get up get that off much as well little
boozy let me just say this you always
bringing up your kids and in the words
of Camilla on the bad girls club let's
keep it real don't make a fuck I got
some kids okay so next I want to talk
about the drama I'm not going to talk
about this whole covergirl cover boy
issue when it hits or whatever about him
saying the Ebola shit because he is I
believe 17 go on 18 and at 17 I probably
said a whole bunch of shit that wasn't
true and it was some stupid shoes that I
would have got nailed to the cross for
now as an adult so imma let that one go
I try to let it slide however it was
brought to my attention but
whole come up was fucking fraudulent and
he lied about everything he lied about
all the stuff that happened a hot-ass
mess and to me he's you know the first
cover boy ever you know cover girl don't
cover boys women but he's the first
cover boy ever for cover girl many MUA
is the first male for maybelline and
they're trying to be a little more
inclusive what all I've been seeing is
just complete and utter bullshit pop it
off within the last couple of the couple
of months but these people are getting
opportunity they're doing no justice to
the community now I will put most of the
blame for his bullshit on cover girl
just because cover girl is now using
influences which is everybody is doing
everybody wants to call us to try to
come in and do something I've had a lot
of offers from a lot of companies who
have come in and say hey we would like
to do this but it just didn't make any
sense because then they wanted you to be
something that you are not in order to
be the picture-perfect person of the
company myself personally
Mattel I would love to be part of
Mattel's roster
however because of my mouth and Who I am
as an individual that just may not be in
the cards for me and I'm okay with that
because as a company they're going to
always make sure they keep their
consumer over a personality so when he
said what he said you guys can go look
at if you would like to that was cool
but now he's under fired because his
friends and put his ass out there for
the lies that he put out as his for his
whole come up with fake and to me this
is another indication that is not about
talent it's about numbers and I told you
guys this 150 million times before and
all I wants to believe what I'm saying
I don't give a fuck if you can't do that
I personally and I don't have anything
against many anyway I don't know but I
think you somebody is make us always
busted it's always terrible what always
looks a mess
however it's not what you know this who
you know who these funds with that's you
nothing if I become friends with Kim
Kardashian's tomorrow chances are my
followers will just triple double and
quadruple because of who I'm friends
with not necessarily what I do there's a
lot of bitches on internet and don't do
shit but they have a lot of our words so
it's about the numbers it's not about
the talent anymore and unfortunately
sad to say but it's just the truth so um
I just feel like the whole entire
situation is these companies need
something giving these kids too much too
fast you know when you have a person
who's still in high school and you give
him all this responsibility he's got a
fuckup he's going to say things and then
you're going to have a lot of people who
don't want to fuck with your company
anymore because of who you associate
with and we have actually promoting your
company so I mean to me it is what it is
I just don't focus that whole plan I do
a lot of guys ask me about Jeffrey star
like how do I feel about him I think
German stars an asshole
I think he's stupid I think that he's a
very talented man who done a lot of dumb
shit in the past and it's come back to
haunt his dumb ass and he deserves
everything that he's getting so it is
what it is do I think that Jeffrey
Sargent races quite frankly yes I do I
think he has a very racist undertone to
everything that he does
from his ads with black girls and after
it came up and he was calling people
nigga bitches with a hardy are at the
end and his MySpace days from telling
the bitchy should kill herself she's all
types of stuff now I do talk very
reckless especially to a bitch rude and
tried the fuck out of me so I can
understand him on that especially we
have being an introvert and him being
different I get that but when all is
said and done she is a business owner
and I would not buy you a part of her
let anybody that I don't buy your
products norm for the fact what you did
he needs some social media training she
need to have somebody else run his
actual page and he needs to calm down
with the bullshit that he's doing but
this is what people do it is just this
whole clan of the gays that are really
giving a bad name we didn't want to come
out and kind of make a difference but
this is what happens in every community
there's always a group of fucked up is
going to make it hard for everybody else
going forward um
the other drama that you guys kept
asking me about what the Nicki Minaj
she's a record that really ma played out
and how did I feel about that um okay I
will say this you guys know I'm not the
biggest Nicki fan by a longshot she has
a couple of phones that I like I'm
really like home more song features in
whatever but there's no I'm a daughter
looking fan to the day that I die but
what I will say about this is that don't
feel like she sir is Remy's best work it
feels a lot like Papoose it doesn't feel
like Remi although she did hit on a lot
of a lot of key points
and Nikki has always known for
responding so the fact that she has and
says a lot and I just seen about 30
minutes ago that really has a new record
coming out I'll call the feast and it's
a girl to cover alone I just and I'm
like believe in my eye so bathroom Nikki
and me were like oh well Nikki got money
ain't only the particle mapper she
doesn't judge she's the queen the queen
doesn't have time to respond well she's
been responded everybody but Remy so she
got time and so again I think a lot of
people especially the fails are taking
it a little bit too seriously and then
when Nikki and Kim out or should I
definitely think it personally but now
would it be in years past it's not that
deep y'all it's hip-hop
this is what people in hip-hop do
because tomorrow they could be doing a
record record together so it just
depends but in my opinion Remy did she
she does ending again let me got her but
it's because nikki has definitely has
not been knocked off her pedestal in
quite some time she hasn't had anybody
to do that so I think it's great for
female hip-hop if anything I think it
brings a shit to light it shows that you
know this still exists it's not a dead
Sharma it's actually something that
actually it here is doing something so
for me I love it um Brittany I mean up
but I'm still shocked that Nikki hasn't
said anything I've seen the shit that
Safari I said had to say Meek Mill had
to say which I think he's also a bitch
but you know it's what it is but yeah
guys it's a lot the internet social
media is definitely allotted and Nikki
definitely took that
sexually-transmitted L from Meek Mill
for Shore with this one in you know I
think she should have definitely said
something back and for all the fans she
got more money than bring me she it's
not about money it's about talent and
when all is said and done like I just
said to you is about the numbers it's
not about the talent like that but rural
hip hop head it's about how they can
give a fuck about how many pink
Lamborghini she's going to buy that
doesn't matter what can you do everybody
loves fucking any out of mourning nobody
wants a butler anymore so again you and
you and you and you have good agile ass
so I would like for her to get on her
her a-game it and come back with
something I love to hear and come back
with something that's we and it's off
kilter but yet still classic Nikki that
you like okay
fuck with you girl you came back to the
finish your throne whatever throne you
may feel that beat for the minajesty or
whatever the substitute is that came or
whatever it's good entertainment and I
think that's what we're missing right
now it was good entertainment because
let's just face it about a month ago we
was fucking sitting up there talking
about the fight that's going to happen
between so when Chris Brown and know why
Isis is a joke so it's good to see that
the shift has actually went back to
where we're judging her not based on
what she does not bit of what she's
doing but based off her lyrical skills
as an MC because that's what her job is
and that's what she does let's get back
to the basics okay
so I just want you to be a real quick
just because I wanted to kind of cover
all the basics of what what's been going
on with with social media and I just a
rant because I be one of the say a lot
of stuff but then I feel like when I
type it is they don't have the same
effect as it has when so I'll catch out
in my next one please</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
