anymore
I think I did like one video in this car
since I've had it but I do want to talk
to you guys today about cuz I was just
today I went shopping and then um yeah I
met this lady while I was in the mall
and she was like you know I love that
you are who you are and you're happy
about it and you love yourself it was
random I don't know this lady
you know from holding wall and she also
said to me she's like never self doubt
yourself and I don't know it was just
random like I don't know this woman from
a hole in the wall however for her to
say that I was just kind of like like a
good ass topic cuz we all do it we all
have self-doubt about ourselves and the
things that we do and I was just talking
to one of our friends that I know and
she was explaining to me how she had you
know voiced her opinion about some
things she wanted to do and another
friend of hers wasn't as she wasn't
really receptive to it as she thought
she was gonna be and she's just like
after hearing you know her take on it it
kind of made me want like doubt if I was
doing the right thing and I you know I I
think kind of what it is and I what I
told her I said a lot of times when you
step out the box and you do something
different you do something that's not
the norm people tend to kind of like
throw rocks at you like what are you you
know it's a good people are from the
hood are they're from you know obscurity
or whatever you want to call it and they
try something that everybody in your
mama isn't trying and is it oh that's
stupid that doesn't make any sense I
remember when I had started wearing
recipes to mb's clothes but I remember
when I was wearing all the acrylic
necklaces and stuff like that I remember
specifically getting to it with another
I guess you could say youtuber I don't
know his STIs but okay and he called
them necklaces Party City necklaces
which I thought was quite it was funny
to me I thought it was funny
um I'm like you really told me but then
not even
probably was about a year but between a
year a year and a half later everybody
was doing it everybody was wearing
acrylic around their neck everybody was
about Party City so I'm just kind of
like now had I been a bitch that
followed everybody else then I woulda
just look like a follower at this
particular point but then you can go
back in my history and see that I did
that and was doing that you know trend
way before it was a trend you know so I
think one of the things that people have
to understand about just things that
they want to do in life and and and how
you want to see yourself and how you
want others to see you is that you're
you're not perfect but you can also do
things that your heart desires stop
trying to do things that everybody else
in a mama desires is cuz it's whack you
know I I do a lot for myself and I do
the things that make me happy the most
for myself I am not trying to make
everybody any mama
excited and happy about the things that
I do because everybody is again they're
not gonna be happy for you no matter
what you do and they were talking about
how people it's perception and how you
can't allow other people's perception to
define who you are as a person because
there's always gonna be something wrong
and I was watching the real the other
day and it was like a dreams like there
are just people who talk in my
comments all the time and you know it
don't know no matter what I do if I
walked on water they would say well you
know what she walking on water cuz our
ass can't swim you know it's always
something so that's what I said in my
video about being perfect is that you
can't allow others and how they feel to
to kind of curb you know the things that
you want to do in life because the
self-doubt is gonna kill your dream and
you don't want that to happen there are
so many things that I've been so
passionate about and I've told friends
or just people in general about like I'm
excited about this and I really want to
do this and then they'd be like why like
that's stupid that's just that's just
not tangible like why would you want to
do that if I was you I would do that you
know and it's like I never ever ever do
that to people because you know you
don't know who you could force out of
their dream everybody isn't as strong
minded as maybe you are to allow other
people's opinions about what you liking
you do
to roll off your back some people will
really say what you say as the gospel
and you know they'll start to fill away
and then they're like well I don't want
to do it because I think that people are
gonna do this is down to third you know
so I think people I think is is Europe I
wanted to just tell you guys stick to
what you want to do if you feel very
conscious and very passionate and very
excited about something then just simply
do it you don't need no one else
approval to do it but your own stop
allowing other people's jaded ways of
life to define how you see yourself and
how you decide you want to live your
life because a lot of these people don't
have anything to lose a lot of them
don't have any passion for anything else
in life they're just sitting and they're
like Hermits they're just like living
day to day - doing the same thing
they're not moving up the ladder and I'm
moving down the ladder they're just
stagnant and they want you to be the
very same because again misery love
misery loves company you know a lot of
people who are successful these days
everybody would said it couldn't be done
or it's not possible or you shouldn't do
that or it's stupid and now they look
back on and they're like yeah you know
it just makes them look very dumb so
yeah you guys stick to your dreams and
stick to the things that that make you
feel great about yourself if you're a
mill and you like to wear hair do it if
you're a female who doesn't want here do
it it's all in how you feel the world is
gonna perceive you in a negative light
nine times out of ten anyway are they
gonna judge you before they get to know
you
nine times out of ten anyway so the
point of trying to get these people's
attention and their acceptance of you
and your dream is pointless you know
it's just it's like beating it's like
going to a prostitute for a hug it's so
pointless you know this is not what you
hope so
yeah keep that in mind make sure you
guys um I just really really really
don't let don't become the don't become
a prisoner of your own mind but don't
become a prisoner of the world the the
greatest thing about life is the fact
that you are free like the greatest
thing about living in America it is the
home of the free and we need to start
living by that motto because we have so
much opportunity that we don't take and
we allow the
who should have any say-so or any
opinion about our life make decisions
for us
no unknowingly sometimes you don't know
that you're allowing someone else's
personal views to dictate how you get
old you shake and move in your life you
know whether it's your parent whether
it's your significant other whether it's
a sibling whatever you know you do let
them know respectfully I respectfully
decline your advice you know and you go
about your day because the only way that
you can prove them wrong is to actually
do it if you sit there and you take
their advice and it doesn't work out or
you never do it day one and sometimes
people tend to forget that so again I
want you guys to understand love
yourself love love love the skin you're
in love the body you're in just just
love yourself in goal for your passions
do not doubt your purpose do not doubt
your life do not doubt your blessings do
not doubt that anything that has come to
fruition for you is an accident or it's
you know it's not an accident it's it's
that was for you you may not feel that
way or others make you mean others may
make you feel as if those things are not
for you but they're for you because they
wouldn't happen if they was not for you
okay trust me I'm a firm believer in
standing in your own light stand in your
truth and being happy with who you are
as a person because you'll go much
further then trying to be perfect or
trying to fit the mold of someone who in
actuality doesn't want anything but
negative things for you and if the
person is not a person who wants the
negative things for you however they
have a tendency to not be the most
supportive this is when you start to not
share your your dreams your goals
and your aspirations because here's the
thing you can tell people all day about
your dreams your goals and your
aspirations but understand this you do
it then you tell them you don't have to
tell them everything because when you do
not conquer what you set out to do that
gives people permission to break that
the very thing that you've built you
know whether it be your confidence
money you know whatever the situation is
you're giving in permission to say okay
now you can pretty much tell me that I'm
never gonna be anything and it's not
gonna work
no you do it you sure improve then you
tell them because at that particular
point you you take it or leave it
get to that simple you know so I love
you guys I hope you guys did enjoy this
I cannot find my damn tripod thing so I
could drive and talk cuz that would be
wonderful but I can't find it so I'll do
it in another video but I hope you guys
are enjoying these videos the day in May
I actually like this I'm liking it a lot
because I feel like I'm more connected
to you guys because we're kind of on
this I'm just sitting here you know it's
a nice beautiful day as you guys can see
and you know I'm in the car I just came
from shopping I'm supposed to be home
doing videos but you know listen I can't
be I can't do it all okay so I will talk
to you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
