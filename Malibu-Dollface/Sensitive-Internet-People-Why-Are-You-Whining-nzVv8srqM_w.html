yeah um before I get started though I
want to give a shout out to my girls to

yeah do that
now to the topic at hand this topic is
about sensitive ass internet people okay
people who cry and bitch and bellyache
and fucking shit on their self about
shit that they don't have no control
over because it's not about them I'm
addressing you now recently you guys
know that little Kim released her mixed
a Black Friday and the cover is very
gruesome and it's um Nicki Minaj
beheaded is blood is a pink wig you know
it's funny you know um the Minaj fans
got very upset the ones who are true
Minaj fans took it in stride and laughed
about it and let it be what it is the
diehard fans got upset they got mad and
pissed on herself they were you know
over their bathtub with their pink
Friday Stevie ready to kill herself you
know it's not that deep you don't know
her I don't know Kim with the flow
but we're gonna get in today um a lot of
people got upset with me because I went
in usually I don't say anything
regarding those two because I know it's
a very sensitive subject for both fan
bases so I try not to say nothing when I
did videos about the two I did it before
Kim even said anything so if you go back
and look at the dates on my other
channel about videos about them so Kim
hadn't even came out and said nothing
publicly about the girl so yeah that was
all me and so I world's opinion now what
I don't get is this um if someone likes
someone else why are you upset if I say
something in my video let me address
that to the last video that Minister
will did a lot of people will not a lot
but some
people were offended a lot of people
found the comedic and funny so for shout
out to the people who found it funny
shut up to the people who were belly
aching and crying about absolutely
nothing um so I personally am not the
type of person who's going to kiss
anyone's ass because they feel some type
of way about my opinion this is
understand this this is called a YouTube
channel okay let's say that again
YouTube channel if you have an issue
with someone has to say on their channel
that means that you shouldn't be there
it's not for you to agree with it's not
for you to tell them that they're wrong
in their feelings it's that you don't
have the right to do that because you
know what you came here that's the
difference you came here that's like me
going to the bank and telling them I
don't like the fact that they have to
deposit my money and they can't give me
cash off my check I gotta wait three
days no no no but you don't have you
can't you don't have it this is how we
work this is the rules over here if you
don't agree with them you don't have to
be here you can go elsewhere and cash
your check so this is what I don't
understand about people it's not that
deep it's not that serious it's the
Internet this is a world that is created
when you cut off your computer this
world now goes bye-bye okay there is a
difference I live in reality I have a
life I do things outside of this so if
you're really hung up on something that
I've said or anyone else has said in a
video you need a fucking life that's
just bottom line you need to lie because
your belly aching and you're crying over
something that's so tedious and not
needed someone got mad at me because I
didn't follow them on Twitter the other
day bitch what the fuck is you mad for
are you serious do I mean that I must
show you in your life where you need me
to follow you on twitter
really you make people get mad because
on Facebook I see a lot of drama on
Facebook a lot of messiness on Facebook
now when I see that I delete people I
have no problem with unfriending a lot
of month others that I should have
friended in the beginning
hey you add me I'll add you just don't
act stupid so people are getting deleted
left and right and they're getting in
their feelings about it it's not that
deep if you really want it to be my
friend on Facebook you want
keep your mouth shut and stop being
messy with other people that's what you
would've did like it it's the whole
world that you will create and it get
into what do you expect because a lot of
these people who do this sit they ask on
Facebook and Twitter all day and don't
have nothing else to do and they leave
the house once a week so I'm not you
know when you make something your world
then it becomes a problem so I
understand why people act the way that
they do cool dandy fine whatever but I
just don't have time for the drama it's
just so unnecessary that's why I've been
eliminated my time on Facebook and a
little dozen lemons about my time on
Twitter because every time I get on
there somebody's belly aching they're
crying about something that I'm saying
and nine times out of ten the things
that I'm saying aren't fucking facts and
true you're mad at the truth oh fucking
well bitch why are you upset what is the
problem somebody hit me up and said why
are you always mad on Twitter nine times
out of ten when I'm on Twitter and you
see me actually going in it's followed
by a little giggle and a laugh and
chances are I'm on the phone with
someone else and we're talking about
something that's totally irrelevant to
the fact of what I'm on the phone I mean
what I'm doing on the computer because
it's not that deep it's funny to me to
see other people get mad about shape
that has nothing to do with them I go
hard for Kim you guys know I love me
some little Kim but at the end of the
day I don't get a check none of that I
just simply say what the facts are and
nice I'm not saying the reason why I do
that is because it gets other people
upset and I see another person get mad
at my opinion of another woman it's
funny as hell to me because it shows
that you have nothing else to do in your
life you are so consumed by this thing
that we call celebrity we call internet
fame all of this shit that you are mad
when bitches get on Twitter talking
about because you're not seeing Minhaj
I'm gonna blow up your house kill your
mother and hang your sister that's
that's funny to me because you are dead
as serious about no fuck like about
nothing like you're not oh yeah okay
you're not scaring anybody what are you
doing like its comedic its comedic due
to the simple fact that it's so not
needed you guys need to learn how to
separate what is a virtual reality from
reality okay there is a difference none
of these people rather a be rappers
singer Britney Gaga beyoncé Nicki Minaj
Lil Kim none of these people we know all
of these people are successful artists
okay you can be a stamp for them but if
someone likes someone else why are you
on the internet having your little goons
come trying to chase somebody down then
try that shit with me but I've seen them
trying with other people where people
are shutting down Twitter pages and all
types of shit its internet bullying at
its best
people are taking shit way too seriously
get a fucking life get a hobby
try ballet try States try motherfucking
bikes try drawing try to do something
besides to chillax on the internet all
day and complain I had a person who hit
me up come because like in the beginning
of this video I do print products and
such now more so than idea on my last
channel because a lot of people say
could you show things that you use and
things of that nature I understand that
every single thing that I do will not be
the liking to everyone else but what
people need to realize is this
everything is not for you it's not for
you I don't do every single thing for
you this is for other people as well
some people don't come here for videos
like this they come here for ha videos
they come here for review videos so
there is a difference I'm trying to give
everybody a chance to do something I had
one person I was only three videos and
already belly aching and crying and shit
over shit that I ain't even digit can I
get to the point yet why are you crying
already
that's let me take it to you taking you
to the store and we only just got in and
you crying at the fact that I invite you
nothing yet bitch can we get down one
hour first please so for all the people
who are mad at me who are upset at me I
could give two fucks of a shit of a damn
hello so if you don't like me after this
video that's fine and I'm fucking dandy
for me because like I said before after
this camera goes off I still continue my
regular life this does not make me miss
Laura breaks me so understand that okay
this is and this doesn't just go for me
this goes for any other youtuber as well
you cannot dictate the things that we
say and do because you're not
contributing to anything no you're not
if you subscribe to someone you
subscribe because you like the things
that they said you can't control no one
because you subscribe
you're not funny nothing that's like me
coming to your house and say you know I
don't really like the way that you have
your living room arrange you know I know
you brought all the furniture you know
and you and you had to deliver it and
all that good stuff but I want to change
it around it doesn't work like that you
don't have that much power when it comes
down to the things that us as youtubers
and things that we say these are
personal feelings I'm not a kiss-ass I
don't kiss people's ass for them to come
in and subscribe to me if you have an
issue with the things that I say then
this channel is not for you and that's
just simple and this is the last time I
want to say this okay because people are
you get too sensitive you're crying over
why the fuck are you belly aching over
some shit that doesn't matter what the
fuck why are you mad you need that's
that's when people need a life when you
when you willing to go someone else's
page your comment negatively about some
things that he said I could have said
anything in the book anything in the
fucking book and and you had took
offense to it then you should have just
said okay you know what maybe he's not
the person that I thought he was or
maybe this is not the person that I want
to be subscribed to or maybe this is the
person that this is how we feel because
everybody doesn't feel the same remember
that okay there's things that people say
my own personal friends they say that I
don't agree with it I just don't that
doesn't mean they're now gonna be four
anymore
that means doesn't mean they're not
gonna talk anymore they simply mean that
particular subject it's not something
that we agree on it called being an
adult remember that okay all of us most
of us that subscribe here again we're
getting to adult aware young adults we
need to start acting like them
so if I simply say I don't like the gay
community because this is that any other
then respect me for my opinion because
yo ass ain't never walked in my shoes to
know what I've been through and regards
to the people that are in question so
remember that okay if you were straight
okay and I told you oh you good you good
it I mean if she was just right you
would be very offended because that's
something that you went through
I never went through it so I can feel
what you feel that is the difference so
remember that on the internet you
subscribe to these people
everybody's individuals everybody is
different so stop fucking belly aching
over shit that has nothing to do with
you and you don't will agree with it to
change the channel if I don't want to
watch the news then I'm gonna change the
Cartoon Network okay because that's more
of my steez that's all you have to do I
don't have no problem but don't try to
get mad at me and bitch you this and
vixx you that that doesn't hurt my
feelings because the word bitches method
that's like luck to me that's like hello
that's like hi to me so don't think the
word bitch and hoe and fuck you and your
mama's dead and didn't even know my mom
she's alive and kicking hello so I mean
I don't know it's funny to me people are
way too caught up like the lace up on
the internet and they think they're
doing something someone yesterday called
me ignorant okay you ignorant for
telling me I'm ignorant
I was ignorant when your eyes decided to
follow me on Twitter and I was I know I
wasn't I you know it only time people
really get upset with you is nothing
just Craig they strike home with them
you know if it doesn't apply to you
you'll be sitting back laughing the joke
is not funny when it's on you now is it
that's why people get upset that's why
people want to get mad and that's what
people be sitting back Billy akin and
damn near crying so yeah with that said
I'm gonna go and if you would like to
add me on Facebook which should be this
link right here or follow me on Twitter
which is this link right here and if you
don't want to do anything then you can
unsubscribe to that button right there
