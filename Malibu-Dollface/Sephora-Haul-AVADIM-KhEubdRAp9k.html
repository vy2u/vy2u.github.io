little haul we're gonna do it again
we're gonna do this time we're gonna do
a makeup so I'm often asked about the
type of makeup I use and all this good
stuff which again will be in my full
face tutorial well before we get there
I'll give you some of my personal
favorites that I won't be able to
explain because it's clearly a tutorial
okay so the first thing is gonna
actually be my makeup holder which I got
from I think long locks Inc and I'll put
the link to this actual horrible look so
this is actually my makeup holder has
all my makeup in it and it's really nice
as a little feet at the bottom it came
from long locks Inc and I got this
sometime last year and I keep all of my
makeup in if you realize how heavy it is
it has a lot of stuff in it so this is
the first thing I would suggest because
I am one of those people that they if
you remember I used to have in my other
videos I go a clear organizer what I
still have but this is same company and
I think it's only like a hundred and
some change but it actually comes with a
plug in the back and the lights in
insight um turn on but I'm not to show
y'all that you can go to your site you
see what I mean
so one of the first things that I'm
totally in love with and I totally would
suggest now mind you all the products
that I'm gonna show you I actually pay
for with my own money this is not a
sponsored video of any sorts these are
actually purchases that I made myself
and I got the receipts to prove it so
it's gonna be this which is the naked
illuminator
and lit this it has this nice gold color
which is really hard to see with the
camera I'm using but it says nice pretty
like goldish color and it gray looks
great you know y'all want to look like
The Tin Man cuz I've been seeing some of
y'all with the with you but you gotta
use a lot of it and you just hit it here
and it gives you this nice shiny look
you know you run it down your nose don't
want to miss them my contour but you
know
and you brush it up on your face and it
just gives you this nice glitter
yeah sham pad me look
shout out to Mariah but it's for Urban
Decay is literally the best Luminator
some of the best illuminator that I've
ever personally used I will be using
this in my tutorial as well because I
just got this not too long ago and I've
been looking a nice Shemp at me mess so
I will be using this and I would suggest
this one again this one is lit which i
think is the most golden one if you can
tell there's a lot of flakes of glitter
flying around right now because it'll
get you laid the next thing that I'm
obsessed with and I think that anybody
who wears anybody who contours and
highlights I would suggest this product
because I was at first when I was first
starting to like wear a lot of makeup
and I was learning to highlight and
contour my face I had to issue a full
coverage that was a problem for me and I
was using my Iman sticks as you guys
know I've accused those for years and
they give you a like medium to sheer
coverage but I needed a full coverage
because I hate when I go ahead and
highlight and contour and you still can
see like my imperfections in my face
after I've done all of this work so I
was watching Patrick Starr one day just
randomly and I knew that he knew a lot
about makeup and one of the things he
did was a full coverage video and in a
video he mentioned this Mac foundation
which is v I have it in NW 40 it's the
full coverage foundation and he stated
that you can only get these at the Mac
Pro store so here in California the
closest one to me is the Mac Pro store
on Robertson where it's like a cross
achievement kits in and I went to that
one they match my color perfectly so
again this is a NW 40 this will cover a
tattoo it will cover your life this is
actually from my understanding the same
thing as the little confirm the
concealer ping pots that you use for
your eyebrows or it can still under your
eyes it's like literally the exact same
thing
but it's really huge so it's actually
like a like a clay to it as you guys see
I'll be dipping real yeah um but this
actually really works I love this stuff
to death I have tried so many I have so
many foundations everything from Marc
Jacobs down to the Queen collection I've
tried everything and nothing has given
me the look I want
but this so this is great you just have
to set it which would be of my next
thing
so my next thing is my Holy Grail which
is mostly everybody's Holy Grail which
is the Ben non-luxury banana powder um I
used to this I actually posted a video
on Instagram with this on while I was
listening to Busta Rhymes and you guys
see how after does I just that off I
look like this and for the longest the
issue that I had was trying to find a
actual setting powder that I liked and
the anastacio one actually that comes in
this kid in his inside of your kid what
you guys can tell I've had for freaking
ever this is the banana color that
actually comes with it that looks real
white on camera but it's really yellow
it's discolored um the problem with this
is whenever because it's in a pan form
it is not loose like this powder and
because it's not loose what ends up
happening is you end up with trying to
dab it on and it just doesn't sit on
your face so you can dust it off and it
starts to leave a bit of a streaky look
which I think looks of disgusting so I
don't use this palette really at all
unless I want to contour my I don't use
it unless I want to actually like
contour my nose or something but for the
most part I use only my clay concealer
palette which is my next one I actually
had the original cream palette when it
first came out I had that one and I was
just hitting the panel all the colors
that I used so I recently went to Macy's
as you conceive and I got a new one and
they actually changed the pack on the
packaging I gave my other one to my
sister because she was actually
using still the powder one and she was
like here are you have changed my life
thank you but it's this one which I got
a medium and I got I bought using all my
Anasazi stuff I'll buy a medium I don't
do the dark one and I don't do the light
one either I feel like the medium one
all these colors work best for me so I
believe this is the color corrector um
this is what I highlight with and this
is what I contour with so I used that
the contour color for the side of my
cheeks here so I can get this do all the
Shinar got going on is that illuminator
so yeah and I'm a little bit of
albatross from NARS so this is y'all my
face would look like this it wasn't bit
okay thing freakin amazing so if you
guys have an extra forty dollars laying
around or you're tired of buying on just
little kids you don't know what you do
is or you just want a contour and
highlight and look very very beautiful I
would suggest this this is like the best
thing it's popular and I get it a lot of
times when you buy makeup products it's
just a big way but Anastacio actually
has a good product the only thing that I
would suggest with this is make sure you
buy fix+ because this stuff does dry out
and it's easy to pretty much rejuvenate
it just always to pray minds with some
fix+
and then I put the brush in and then go
do it from there with a cream cream
banana warm coral which actually could
be a color corrector if you have like a
lot of dark circles which I don't have
so I can go straight for the little
banana cinnamon chocolate and ash brown
eye contour with ash brown and I
highlight with banana the next thing is
this little bad boy which is kind of
dirty um which is my Mac what is this
called the mineralized skinfinish and
this one is in dark so what I do is
after I highlight and contour my face
because I highlight here here here under
here sometimes it will cause you to look
a little on the white side so to pretty
much bring your color back I use this
color which is this nice goal
the color and I just dust my entire face
with I actually do this after I put on
my foundation I kind of set my
foundation a little bit and then I just
my entire face with this and then it
brings all my color back that I need but
I still you can still tell I've been
highlighted darling so this is from Mac
I have this again in dark and this is
the Skinner realize the mineralize
skinfinish these last two things are two
things that I recently start using and I
really really really really like so the
first thing is we're gonna do is um this
is the card this is from Tarte I don't
know how to pronounce this particular
name so I'm just gonna leave it alone
but it's actually a eyeliner uh as you
can see and my sister actually put me
onto this and she told me that it works
very well so I actually use it for my
winged liner because I was using the pen
at first and because I was really scared
of this so when you get it's gonna and I
really liked hard I really do and when
you get it it comes with an actual brush
mine's currently dirty and then it comes
with the actual tar that you're gonna
use for your actual winged liner I find
that this brush actually really works
very well however I don't like the way
that it looks after it dries I'm just
not a fan of it so usually I'll take it
just like my my ELF one and go ahead and
kind of like define the lines and my
eyes to make them exactly like I want to
because I feel like it works and it's so
great and maybe I'm just using wrong you
know I'm still new to makeup like that
so maybe I'm using it wrong I don't know
but I do really really like it I think
that it is definitely worth the money
because it does give you this nice
beautiful finish and um it's very
pigmented which is a kind of an issue
with a lot of stuff now I don't know if
I could do was she got on here she was
she was playing kind of hard I don't
know if I could do that the next thing
is mascara a lot of people I know trying
to find a mascara like those um what is
he calling
fiber ones but I think it's like a
unique or young nice I don't know they
try to give me a few times they use the
stuff and I just thought that it just
looked a mess but um plus I wear fake
lashes anyway so I don't really feel the
need but um my sister also told me about
this which is by two-faced and it's
called better than sex and it comes in
this nice little fancy tube like such
and it's legit the best mascara I have
ever used it for $20 it was going to be
but it works so well I have yet to have
drying our issues and somebody actually
put me onto this this is a smaller one
this is like the travel ones so I'll
show you the comparison to the two so
this is the large one and this is a
travel sized one so this is a big
difference you can find these like a
Sephora when you get ready to checkout
they be there I think it's like 12
dollars and this is twenty dollars so if
you don't want to spend $20 you just
want to try it I'll buy these the reason
why I actually brought a small one is
because when I tried to put I ain't do
my bottom lashes today because it just
been lazy but when you wanna do them
this brush is so much smaller compared
to this brush so you don't get it
everywhere and it can get all those
small little lashes to make sure that
you get you know you get your self
looking right so I actually brought this
big one from Macy's and I brought this
small one from Sephora
so yeah those are the things look out
for those in my tutorial because these
are the things that I'm gonna be using
as of now the lashes that I'm wearing
right now that are on so never view or
are from luxury lash which I'll put the
link to these below these are called
like shine on me or shiny or something
like that and my lip is my classic YSL
nearly nude with my chestnut matte
pencil so I will catch you guys in my
next one I hope you guys really enjoyed
this and I'll put a list of products
below so so where you can get them if
you're interested okay
