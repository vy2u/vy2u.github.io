12:30 8:00 in the morning and I just
found out that leathery Oh Donald Trump
is now our US president thank you
everyone who didn't vote I am glad they
can get the night one
no more Adam Warren you see a tipping
like to talk to a nephew now they just
don't trust jelly beans
lollipops can triple date that's the
trick
this hair is from Chuck's hair hair and
they send me the shirt but this shirt is
ill-fitting as hell and I don't know how
they Vic is graphic but it is busting
through all year okay so I have in 20 I
had for 28 inches in body weight and I
have a massive frontal as well that I
went ahead and added some color and
while I was doing my other wig I decided
that I wanted to go ahead and add some
color into this so this is like an all
burnished color and I wanted to show you
guys that after I did the color I wasn't
sure how the pattern was going to work
so I just took a big flexi rod and I put
it in as you can see it still matches
the other pattern is not as luster full
um and that's only because of the color
difference the color variation it
doesn't look as oh it hasn't as much
luster in it as the rest of the hair
does so this is what all 28 inches and
four bundles looks like from the back
and this people and you guys know this
is crazy because I'm about to say it
this is a lot of hair okay this is a
whole lot of hair and I just couldn't
figure out what to do with this so I
feel like Michael Jackson Thriller it's
a lot of red going on here um so to the
hair itself as you can see I've had this
hair for quite some time
and it still holds its body wave now
this isn't the enough the natural state
of this hair this is what it looks like
after I went ahead and body waves body
wave after I flexi rod it did the all of
this hair up this is the result that I
got from it
so again if you do have here that has
texture in it and you do put a little
color in it or you wear for quite some
time and then it starts to fall then
grab some flexi rods and boom there you
go
the frontal I really like I really
enjoyed this frontal a whole lot because
I may be using my bigger or a mannequin
head which is a 24 inch wind as opposed
to my 22 or 23 inch one just to see
because I like when my I like to go
ahead and glue everything down with the
gossipy glue but I like when my wave
your curly hair has a little bit more
space because it seems like I can move a
little bit more in it which I can now as
far as the shedding goes I did get a few
strands here and there and every now and
then I'll grab one but again it's
nothing major it's nothing hmm it's
nothing major that I'm getting which is
great and you know a lot of times when
you pluck a nice amount of hair out of
these units or out of these frontals you
get a lot of you know leftover hair and
I was able to actually like run my
fingers through everything after I went
ahead and plucked it and it was cool so
that's the great thing I love about this
too because it is so long it's not it's
wearable like this like this is great
for review this is great if I'm going
out this is not work hair you know it's
not positive a lot of it in it because
it isn't straight it's hard to sometimes
tame so this will be cute with like a
braid in the front or if you want to
just you know break this and bring this
back to kind of get it out your face or
if you just want to wear it and a half
up half down this would be great for
that because it is so much hair I think
three bundles probably would have been
just enough for this um I don't really
feel like I needed the fourth bundle
because they sent four I use four but
like I said I'm usually not the one that
ever says anything about it being a lot
of hair ever end yeah but you see how
this pattern just is right back into it
with the rest of it even though I've
already bleached this in putco cuz I
bleach the color then I put the color
over it the color that I put over it is
a dark
Albarn so I just wanted a little bit of
color in the front
it was much lighter when I bleached it
and then I toned it down to this color
so it it meshes with what's going on but
it's not too crazy because I did want it
to where my you know ghetto door
knockers and I'll put the link for these
below as well but I wanted to do
something that was a little bit
apparently I'm feeling thriller nights
is what the hell I was going for so yeah
I really do really do like sexy hair I
don't really have too many issues with
them if ever I think I had like one
moment where I didn't like some hair
that they sing but overall they've
always sent me great hair I've always
got great hair and a lot of my
subscribers who bought hear from them
said they have gotten great hear from
them as well so that's the great thing
that I like to hear back as well and I
also like to hear the fact that people's
hair they'll be like after seven months
my hair is still curls back after seven
months the crow pattern isn't looking
crazy so that's great as well now as far
as how it took colour it soon as I put
the bleach on it is snatch the stank up
off the color which is great and then I
remember conditioning it and I use my
Tresemme conditioner you know the
moisture the rich moisture is best in
the world and when I had it just sitting
I just kind of like took it tore my
fingers to see if it would spring back
because it it it does have a bit of a
curl you know in a pattern to it and it
actually went back while was still like
saturated with a whole bunch of
conditioner which sells a lot because a
lot of times whenever there is any type
of especially body weight because body
wave is much of a lighter wave to the
hair versus other um other hair so it is
not treated
much um the Virgin that is being claimed
to be like I always tell you guys
nobody's here is this uniform so it
definitely has had some process what
process I can't tell you you know
verbatim what they did but it's
definitely not the original say I do
believe that this hair was originally
straight and the reason why I say that
is because the way that it lays it lays
very flat so the S pattern isn't an S
pattern it's more of an S pattern like
that so that means it lays down it
doesn't have a like when you put a flexi
rod in your hair and you take it out the
flexi rod has body to it when I got this
hair everything was an S pattern but it
was flat so it's difference between a
curl Aquila curl and an S pattern and a
lot of times when you do get an S
pattern depending on what it is you ever
see like hair that's being sold and it's
two bundles together but they wrap them
together so it's this big but it's like
a three dimensional curl so it does have
a more vyx its expansion this is more of
a flatter girl
well flatter wave and this is of course
like I said before this is their
Brazilian body wave everybody's favorite
now a lot of times people ask me how
many bundles what they need to achieve a
more natural look or to achieve the look
that I have always put my bundle count
in the beginning of all my videos that
you guys know but just this alone is
half of the hair pulled for because the
other half is there so imagine like this
is a lot like this is definitely if I
was a celebrity of some sorts and I was
going somewhere for I made it on parents
on something this would be that like you
see your favorite on a reality show or
they're making an appearance on American
Idol or they come somewhere this is what
I wear and this is how much hair I would
wear the average person three bundles
for this especially this length would be
max for anybody else if you're just
trying to be extras your birthday coming
up and you just want to be stupid and
get crazy with it
then for it would be but for the average
person three is enough just make sure
that you get a frontal and not a closure
with this
you won't get that same effect with a
closure as I'm getting with this because
this will not lay down like this with
the closure but give you more of you
have to find a stationary part with it
it doesn't look as natural so sexy here
you know you guys always do me well I
always have great things to say I'm very
happy with this hair I'm probably gonna
go ahead and do this color throughout
the entire wig I think I'm gonna just do
this all burn color all the way through
just because I really do like how it
turned out and I feel like if everything
was this color I can give you another
look and I want to do um probably like
uh actual style where I put like braids
or something in this front so when I
split all the way down to see how it
looks
so if you guys are interested in this
look make sure you guys check the links
below and I will catch you in my next
one
I mean I'm excessed with these earrings
because they so ghetto and I'm just okay
okay y'all feelin it because I'm feeling
it okay bhujette oh but then I just
thought about Donald Trump is our
president yet again and I just got sad
all over catch on in the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
