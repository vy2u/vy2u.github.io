don't wanna so the only hair that
I've had similar Gibbons Italian Yakuza
do make a parody to the cheerful to show
you what the difference is okay so
listen
understand me real quick this is popping
okay so I just have one hang-up y'all
know what I'm about to say so you guys
know one of my most popular videos ever
is a tutorial I did on a Italian yaki
wig of a full lace wig that I had um
don't have it anymore
long story so I think I've had about two
or three Italian Yankee wigs that I've
done reviews for but I've never had any
wefted here so the people over age sex
hey hair decided to go ahead and ask me
that I want to do a review and I was
like what let me give y'all want me to
do it on body wave
and they don't know we want you to do it
yes I'm sick of by the way we want you
guys want you to do it on kinky straight
okay I've always seen it on people's
sites but I've never ever thought hmm I
should review that partly because I
never wear my hair out this will blow my
hair gray but I never they never have
closures or front tools up for them so
I've never thought about it so this oppa
right here I made I call washed all of
this hair so that's why it's a little
more Ripple's right here cuz I just let
it air dry I didn't blow Jif I would've
blow-dried it would have been more like
this so this is their kinky straight and
I'm gonna kind of refer to Italian yaki
and a lot of this because this is the
only texture that I've had a similar to
that one so I'm going to kind of compare
the two so yeah kinky trades poppin
though I really like this gives you more
of a blow-dry poppin situation you know
like I'm bout to get my we've done when
we finished that
with him given I just wanted to see how
it was I have a guy absolutely
positively no shading with this and this
look like this could really be my hair
at all for Rio this looks like I'm
getting ready to UM get my weave um flat
iron so I can go out doesn't look like I
feel like Italian and yaki Barbie that's
why I feel like Mattel we do this then I
got the green eye I feel like if I would
have like some candy yum yum when I feel
like this would have been a moment okay
so my bun boos so I have a 22 a 22 22 a
20 and a 16 inch of closure
I have two 22s in two 20s I believe in a
16 inch closure cuz I don't believe this
is three month I believe this is for I
just can't find out the packaging this
is what I got left so this still looks
very similar to this except you said
this is kind of a little harder but yeah
this is pretty much what it looks like
now so if I whether when I look over
that if I were to went ahead and
blow-dried it once I unwashed it then it
all would have been like much bigger and
Chaka Khan ish let's see start with the
pros of this hair this hair is very
light you would think it would be very
heavy but because it is a yaki texture
is the density is much thicker um I did
straighten a piece of this hair just to
see how it would straighten and it's
kind of poufy it's not exactly the type
of here I would wear like get it and
then straighten it out
you could however curl it in its natural
state like this and it will give you
more of a natural look now because my
hair is so long you guys might get like
a 16 to 18 to 20 so it may look a little
bit different on you because mine's is a
little bit longer only because I just I
like my hair to be I don't want involved
I just don't want to be blown so I'm
surprised when I washed it
you would think no shedding hey no no
shading whoo oh that's the piece there's
a key three times to get there so yeah
um they gave me a closure I'm not crazy
about the closure I do like how the hair
is in the closure because it definitely
matches but I just wish I would it gave
me a frontal this one a frontal would
have been popping and all that closures
cuz they come with these baby ears right
here look at those come on listen I
might so just throw some gel on this and
just scream beat it cuz that's exactly
what I'm giving and I'd be seeing girls
like this and they'd be like you can't
even tell I have a wig on yes you can we
all can tell Latoya so yeah that's the
part that I don't really like too much I
don't like the long pieces which you can
cut and you can customize but I wanted
to kind of show you guys what it looks
like somewhat out of the box so I went
ahead and made it on a wig cap which I
believe if you're watching this right
now I don't know if that video is up or
not but it should be a video it should
be one cuz yeah so it should be a video
of me how to make a wig it should be
listed here or somewhere in this video
y'all is looking for ages it's there so
anyway um how I constructed that wig um
should be the same way I did this one it
was no different except for when I put
my closures on my wigs I definitely put
them right on the cap then I sew around
so that it doesn't splatter doesn't move
frontals are a little bit different and
if the videos up then it should be there
okay so this by far is some of my most
favorite hair that I've gotten from a
company in a very very very very very
long time and that's due to the fact
that it looks natural it's nothing crazy
about it it's not crazy lustre it
doesn't look super nappy it definitely
has a blow-dry and go look to it which I
love I hate when I see Italian like
Italian I can hear a lot of times and
the thing that kills me about it is that
a lot of times the hair looks too coarse
and it's like okay I get it they have
like a little coil but Jesus like it's
just you could tell that after a while
of being hot you gonna do this and it's
not gonna do this this is which it
should be very easy to run your fingers
through unless you don't put something
in it
but yeah it shouldn't be hard because a
lot of time
because his hair is more on a drier side
meaning it doesn't have crazy amount of
luster and that whole thing that is
easier to dry what I bleached his hair
No
so I wouldn't do that and it's because a
lot of times this hair is because it's
been chemically processed to be like
this whatever they put on it to do this
is usually not the greatest thing to
counteract in add bleach to it just
saying and so if you look into do like a
natural look like a purple furrow but
you wanted to still have some texture to
it I would just get the hair already
blonde
I wouldn't go ahead and ruin my hair
because there's no point but yo sexy
hair they've never done me wrong can I
say that I don't believe that they've
ever done my moon don't don't if I did
they have don't include me but I don't
believe that sexy hair has ever done me
wrong every time they send me here I
thoroughly enjoy it so let me know which
eye thing I can't find my bamboos cuz I
was so going there so mmm
but let me know what y'all think about
this you guys aren't interested let me
know
um and let me know what you would do
with this here is so much I can do into
so much I can't do because if I had a
photo I could be able to throw this all
over and do all this but I can you know
I'm saying because my tracks are right
here so uh sexy hair can I get a frontal
or something um but if you have this
here what would you do let me know
comment below and i'ma catch on in my
next I killed that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
