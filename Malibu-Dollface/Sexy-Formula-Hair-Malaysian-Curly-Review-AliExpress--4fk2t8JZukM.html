okay
so this is probably going to be my last
review of the year so I want to let
y'all know where I got this nice subtle
bit big mop top from and you guys know
some of my favorite hair from Aliexpress
has been um 6e formula hair and this
hair is actually no different than my
other hair um I'm in love I don't know
what it is about their hair but it's
always really buttery soft they're
West's are always well constructed and I
always really liked the hair I mean this
is my second with you so don't know
don't get your too crazy but it and like
I get 85 yeah yeah nerves and it's still
pretty fresh and new but look how nice
this looks this looks this looks like
the hair that I just reviewed pray like
well y'all probably got it recently but
it's been a minute this looks very
similar to the hair but it's definitely
very different because my experience has
been a bit different as well so I'll get
to the specs in and I'll get to the the
bundles that I have it okay so this is
the damage that was done on this it's
been a minute so it's been about a month
about a month are probably going on
among since I've had this hair and this
is the hair that I have left so you see
it common still looks like you did when
I first got it but it's definitely Oh a
little bit bigger than it was when I
first got it i co washed his hair one
time and I got a lot of questions about
what do I use to co wash my hair when
it's curly and I use the organics
coconut milk shampoo and conditioner
because it just makes the hair very soft
and it helps it bounce back and become
very big and fluffy in you know
uniformed and pretty like this and again
I always I'll construct my wigs
then I Drive them when they are curly or
sometimes lady I Drive them upside down
so it helps all the curls bounce back
like this and then they stay fluffy and
big like this okay so I'm currently
rocking to 18 to 16 in the 14 inch
closure I could be missing a bottle but
I believe it's only for um they came
like this they came later like this so I
didn't do anything to him I just pulled
them apart and when they curled last
night when I dried last night when it
grew last night when I dried last night
after I washed them I just went ahead
and pulled them apart now I am getting
some a little bit of frizz but that's
only because I'm pulling it and if I
would have left it alone it would have
stayed how was when I first when I first
let it dry my closure routes right here
are kind of on a straight side so I'm
not crazy about the closure I don't hate
the closure but I definitely am not
totally in love with it but it
definitely works
I took my wand and I went ahead and
wanted some of the top so that it can
match a little bit more from the root so
it looks so straight because the only
thing I had about curly hair is that
when you sometimes get a closure -
closure the roots belay super straight
and then it just gets this curly thing
going on and it just just doesn't work
but it definitely gives me a nice full
vibe you know it definitely looks as it
looks like how many bundles it is and
this is much shorter than what I had
before but I definitely like it I think
it's proportionate to my face I think
it's just enough hair and I think that
the length is just enough for me um
sometimes you do want to have a little
bit of some longer hair depending on how
the dramatics are with you where you're
going with it but for me this was enough
and I think for a lot of you guys this
actually would be enough 18 when it's
curly like this will make it look like a
16 and then so forth and so on so you
you kind of get what I'm saying right
now
like it's gonna look shorter than it is
because hair is usually for now usually
people um it's measured based off how
how long it is straight not how long it
is curly so this would be like a a 16
this would not be 18 18 would be right
here so if you stretch it of course it's
going to be longer um I've gotten um I
would say out of 100 percent
I've got like 20 percent shedding you
know when I do run my fingers through it
when it's wet I do get a nice amount of
um I'm a nice amount of shedding um but
again you can calm this down after you
wear it a little bit it should stop
mines did so it just depends and I did
with this a lot with curly hair it will
shed or when you initially put it in it
and after you having it in for so long
the shedding usually some sizing stops
I'll give sexy formula a nice b-plus
with this because I do love the hair I
do love how it looks and I do like the
flow it was just a few things that I
didn't like and one was the way my
closer look because it was a little too
straight at the root the amount of frizz
we should come down with like some frizz
ease of didn't come that down but that
tends to be one of the things but it
doesn't natural so I guess you got it
you know the phrases will make your hair
big so you want some of that um and then
the other thing that I really didn't
like was the smell the smell it did that
definitely had a relaxer esque
smell to it and it wasn't very pungent
like somewhere has been it actually was
very light but I could still smell it
you know so yeah I'm not I'm not the
biggest fan of that I like my hair
smells like absolutely positively
nothing
so hence why I co washed it up before
because I wanted to definitely get that
smell out and again it wasn't loud I
just don't want to be walking around
smelling nothing like a hit or a dab or
relaxer not really my thing but other
than that I'm just a nice unit and
it's very cute it's very big it's very
now you know so it looks like I had some
long extensions and I just went ahead
and chopped them out look like my hair
probably would have been like this long
but I was like okay I don't want it that
long i'ma go ahead and chop it and
that's what it look like I did so yeah
my people who are not into super duper
long curly hair and you want something
that look good for work and yeah this
would be perfect
I asked to get high but yeah guys are
interested hit the below ball thank
y'all for watching yeah let me know and
I also just want to say I tried this
with a middle Parker that are you guys
are like what are you gonna do like some
curly hair with a middle part and it was
a very Kelly Rowland esque slash Teyana
Taylor s but the problem was the closure
was so straight and even when I wanted
it it still didn't look like I wanted it
to look so ain't nothing like a good old
flip over method method it just looks
very natural
it lays like it's supposed to but I
still I'm gonna give y'all that nice
straight middle part with some nice
valium and a lot of hair just not with
this unit so um again hit me back let me
know how you guys like this and I will
catch you in my next one
purse and if I don't get to say it
beforehand</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
