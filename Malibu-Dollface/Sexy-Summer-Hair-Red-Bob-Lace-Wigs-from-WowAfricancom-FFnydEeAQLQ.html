since I've had a bob y'all and ever
since I ever had red lips I already
think that because my hair is red as you
can tell has this nice red tone to it
and this wig is from well African you
guys know I became for quite some time
now so I wanted to try a red Bob because
I have done Bob's many of Bob's in
different colors but I've never had a
red one not at least not to my knowledge
I think I've had like blonde I think I
had a green one an orange one but I
think I don't think I've ever had like
just a red one which you would think so
cuz I've had red hair before let me give
you guys a vine specs on this good old
Bob cuz you know the summer is coming
and it's spring right now but this would
actually be very appropriate right now
because it's very easy to the point very
low maintenance Bob's are fun because it
turns you into a different person
because all those ten years older than I
really am with this hairstyle but it you
know you go from that executive realness
look this would be it if you use cold do
be 30 which is Bob 30 you get $30 off
your purchase of any Bob on the site so
the color is a number two at the roots
and then it's a 99 MJ I'm very red so
that's what that's what the code is for
this particular cook so if you know your
your color wheel you know what a
ninety-nine J is it's 12 inches which is
very true when I took it off a box
though oh oh my god is so short like I
thought it was gonna be like hacked off
in the bag I was scared but I got it
together I got it it says it's a hundred
and fifty density which I've had 150
density weeks before
I would say this probably 120 but now at
least not my woman this is a cap number
seven a glueless lace front cap so it
isn't I yeah it doesn't have any um it
doesn't have any comb it doesn't have
any combs in it not that I know of when
I put it on nothing got snagged and
usually when something gets snagged you
know I was like oh yes combs in it it's
not an adjustable strap in the back it
just pretty much fits snug so I can do
this it's not gonna go anywhere like I'm
sure if I like really tried to pull it
off it could come off though it's a glue
this lace front cap which means this is
the parting but the rest in the back are
tracks it's not lace all the way through
the back it's just only lace from here
to here and I think like all it is no
it's yeah it's only is only lace in the
parting area or with all the rest of
this wig is actually like lifted tracks
they said this was used with a virgin
brazilian here what you guys know it
they say it's virgin but it has color
it's no longer virgin it was virgin
probably when they made the wig but
whenever you add color or change the
natural state of the hair it is no
longer considered virgin so yeah it says
tangle free as well which I mean if
you're Bob is tangling that's a problem
like it's not enough hair to be tangling
at all if that's the case but yeah it's
nice it's it's a pretty it's a pretty
cut um whoever cut this I need to flat
iron this part a little bit better but
whoever cut this did a really good job
or it is the wig today to the grocery
store and to go put my stuff in storage
I'm not like why the hell did you go to
storage with a wig on I was like fully
dressed I had no choice cuz I have
somewhere to go so yeah that's pretty
much what this whole situation was so I
had to and a weight didn't even move
like I didn't get in um it didn't get in
my way when I moved it out the way it
stayed out my way it's been flowy the
only thing I did was I laid it down the
part that's and it was the natural part
that came and I just pressed it down and
made it flatter
yes it's really not mean it's a Bob
y'all it's not really much to say about
it it's a Bob it's cut nice as I said it
before it's very flowy I like this see
it's real it's real nice if it was an
asymmetrical bob like this oh I'll be in
heaven but you know it's a it's a basic
summer Bob I guess you could say so yeah
if you want this it's hard to tell the
color on here so I get up like this you
can see it's like this color
oh my eyelash is pretty so this is the
color I'm all in your face this is the
color gray you just really can't tell
that's coming off very black on camera
but I'm sure y'all get the point with
what I'm trying to say right now when
you look on the side you'll see how red
it actually is but it's not like to chew
red is probably around the same color as
my lipstick a little bit I had to make
some lipsticks but I used the Chantel
Christie red lipstick with some of her
pink lip gloss so I made it gave this
berry look on buying lips so yeah I hope
you guys enjoyed this and I have so many
bobs I don't know if I'm gonna keep this
one so this one might actually be in my
wig sale you guys know but I'll talk to
you guys later off</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
