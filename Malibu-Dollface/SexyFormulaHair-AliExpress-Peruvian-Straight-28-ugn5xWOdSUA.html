because like a fairy of filling do
always high and it's killing me ever so
you're to review this nice side part um
I want to call this like Barbie air just
like black Barbie hair this is what this
reminds me of this particular style but
okay before I get into the hair um you
guys know that I love Barbie so this
shirt says I love kin and the girl this
is from the barbie loves wild fox
collection this was one of the shirts
and the girl in the ad was African
American and her hair looked very
similar to this and she wore this so
that's what kind of prompt me to want to
do this look but my hair is from a Alex
price vendor you guys know we're still
trying to find that diamond in a rough
and I think this actually might be one
of them um this is from a company called
sexy formula hair it says 100% human
hair products they contacted me a while
ago you guys I've had this hair for
probably three months I want to say like
three two or three months I don't
remember I've on but I've had this for a
while and the company has been very very
patient with me uh getting this review
out because of the fact that I really
wanted to wear this hair because when I
first received it I loved it and I'm
like this reminds me of someone why like
a very top quality virgin hair that I've
received from other like you know
us-based companies so let's just see
what this does this hair has held up I
will say for these last couple of months
very very very well but of course with
every good there's there they have their
hang-ups as well so we'll get to that in
just a second um but I am wearing a
subway surf rum closure store you guys
know that's what I love to wear because
there they come out and make my installs
look so effortless um so to the specs of
this hair I have
in 428 and I have a 16-inch Subways
closure um
this hair is not very very full but it's
full enough now mind you it was fuller
than this when I first received it but
because I cut all these layers in it is
not as full as I would have liked it to
be and it's only for I'm used to working
with five and sometimes now six bundles
the bundles were not crazy full but they
also wasn't crazy thin either the luster
of the hair is very nice so when I
receive my bundles I did Co wash them um
just to see kind of how the hair acting
because I don't want to just put it in
like I usually do I just wanted to kind
of see all right the hair is kind of
like too good to be true type so let me
just put it in a wash it lets co wash it
and see what it does
gave me no problems no issues at all I
have to say that the customer service
that I received with this company was
very very good um usually a lot of times
the communication between me and
companies that are based out of China
they have issues with our language
barriers and they don't understand that
there is a certain amount of time that
it's going to take for me to do this in
order to get you this and you know just
that that understanding sometimes is a
bit of a struggle for them to get but
this company totally got it they were
very sweet to me very nice to me one of
my bundles I received are all four
bundles it was one bundle that I
received that was just rough and I don't
know what that's all so let me Wanaka
wash it as well because um the other
three were found I could run my fingers
through and it was no problem but that
one bundle just seemed dry and I kept in
snags and everything so I was like well
maybe if I co wash it and deep condition
it um it'll be okay and as soon as I D
condition it it was fine but it was only
that one I've never seen that where only
one bundle is giving me the blues and
the rest of them are just you know fine
and dandy usually if the hair is bad all
the hair is bad but after that it didn't
give me no problems when I worst rated
and snag it didn't tangle it didn't
matter or anything like that so I
actually will say that sixty hair
formula is probably the one of the top
five that I was in so far as right now
would suggest to you guys for Aliexpress
err they have very decent
and they have very affordable prices as
well and right now they're having actual
sale going on which you know ain't
nobody trying to not not get a self um
the Herer that I have in though I don't
think I mentioned that but here I have
it is this is Peruvian hair so these are
all of the things that my bundles hang
in so it's four beans with rubber bands
around them do not get any hair that
show that you do not like wear it and
then try to return it because it's not
going to work that way um but they do
have some very decent hair to be on
aliexpress need to start like a little
like sorry sorry off Aliexpress could
you know you know I'm the same way y'all
when I hear I'll Express I'll go running
for the hills cuz I'm but I'm trying to
kind of get out there and see what's
there what they have and I really do
like this are you guys know it was 28
inches when I got it but I did cut it um
so it's probably about 24 now oh if I
was like a college student or somebody
who is just like my funds were not um
how they should be then I would
definitely consider this hair because
the way I started I started like I do
any of my other hair um and it didn't
give me no problems
I've laid on this hair one time okay so
like the third day after I got this hair
I had went out I came home and I was so
sleepy and I didn't feel like taking my
wig off so I slept in my wig and I woke
up and my hair was not like and I don't
have any but my pillowcases are not sad
in their garden so you guys know satin
keeps the moisture cotton takes to
moisture out which make sure we dry um
but it was cool I mean it was one day
but when I woke up my hair was not I
have went to sleep in some hair y'all
and I woke up and it was it looked like
I have been in a fight and I lost okay
so this is the sexy formula Peruvian
straight I have four bundles of 28-inch
and I have a 16 inch Subway's closure
Russian Streisand race closure from
closure story so I'll catch y'all in the
next one and I hope y'all enjoyed this
one and I like my Barbie here this is
really cute like it gives me um a very
cute mellow vibe yeah
oh all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
