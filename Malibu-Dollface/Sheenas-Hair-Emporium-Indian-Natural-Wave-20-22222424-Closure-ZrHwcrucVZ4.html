been it's been a minute since I did like
any reviews on any like actual wefted
hair but that's because I've been taking
a bit of a break and then y'all my I'll
tell you on a later video whatever
anyway I'm doing a review today for this
hair that I'm wearing which is from
Sheena's hair emporium and this is this
review is special to me because uh
Sheena Terran was the first hair company
that ever sent me hair that I ever
review for that I ever got into this
whole world of reviewing hair type
situation this was my first baby step
towards what I'm doing now so yeah um so
yeah this is like I is a when I got with
her I was a little infant this little
freshman one a colleague on I'm in my
college I don't learn so much and now
I'm back
so yes it's definitely come full circle
um but of course she always sends a
personalized note on the back it says
doll face thank you for doing business
with us glad to be working with you
again we love you she and it says that
but the links that I'm wearing are 20 22
22 24 and 24 so that's five bundles I
actually have a closure in as well the
closure is from when she first I don't
know this is the first batch of hair she
sent me up it was the second bastion I'm
not really sure but I do know for a fact
that she did see me a closure and I wore
the closure and I wasn't really too
great with the method that particular
time so I was trying to figure out how
to like make it do what to do but now I
know what I'm doing so yeah this is
actually a closure up here I just did
the flip over method like IV shout out
to my girl Ivy if you don't know her
to be somewhere down here to her face
because she's everything um I used my
Remington curling wand this one to do
these curls and then when I first got
received the hair it was like this I
actually have a bundle left so the
original state of the hair was like this
and then I made it in
that's big difference um but yeah I have
it I did receive a leg receive I did
experience a little bit of shedding when
I cut my webs but obviously when you get
your list you know and I'll be really
looking when I'll be cutting my West oh
I'll just be cutting wherever it needs
to be cut I just cut it so yeah I did
receive a little bit of shedding there
but it wasn't major or crazy or anything
like that it was just you know minimal
now I'm not you didn't Amy it curled
beautifully as you can see these curls
are everything and I just used some
guardian Fruities hair spray to have it
help it hold and that's pretty much it I
put on this bandana here just to kind of
fill out my whole outfit or whatever I
feel very 80s like very I'm a maniac it
is so hot like it's like 85,000 degrees
in LA today but my hair is cute I really
don't care
yeah so as you can see the shooter
emporium they come with the she bands on
them to let you know and then i don't
think they're not listed on which one it
is but they come in these bags the backs
like this each so it has what type of
hair it is virgin indian natural wave
and that's that's what they all are
so they come in this bag to let you know
what length it is and what type of hair
it is which is great because a lot of
times I lose cars I forget stuff and
then I'll be like y'all I gotta go back
and look at my emails when we originally
correspond it to figure out what I'm
actually wearing cuz I don't remember
but besides that when the hair is great
this hair would pick up color very well
as well I just love this look like I
know you guys see I'm trying to try
something different so you guys always
say well you should do curls you always
do it here straight do some curls
doesn't crack and go girls yeah but I
really do love this um I think I'm gonna
try this particular look in a different
style with probably like a different
texture here like more of a now
and see how that actually comes out
because these came out really dope and
it was quick
like I just took very small sections
curl
I was watching below the girls when I
did it I did these last night and then I
just kind of went over the this area and
kind of right here earlier this morning
but all this at the bottom is still from
last night well this morning cuz I did
it at like 4 a.m. if you follow me on
Instagram you know I was up until like
4:00 a.m. posting pictures when I should
have been asleep but yeah if you love
this hair please check out Sheena's hair
emporium for information make sure you
follow her and all the wonderful people
over there that work for her
and it's just I will say this about the
company is that it's a very well-versed
company like they reply promptly from my
experience I reply promptly everybody
that I know who's you know you guys
nothing when she's here and gram here
for like two years now and every hair my
28-inch hair is still kickin my original
curly haired I made straight steel curls
so if this is not really for you she has
so many other options that you could
definitely look up I know for me this
hair because it's Indian it's not as
thick as what I'm used to but it felt
good to come back and I have 85,000
bundles of hair that I would have for
curls normally that's what it is when I
wear five bundles and it's so much hair
after a while because I've been here all
day you know trying to just get this
look but because the hair so thick so it
does feel good to just wear a little
Indian well Indian natural wave so like
