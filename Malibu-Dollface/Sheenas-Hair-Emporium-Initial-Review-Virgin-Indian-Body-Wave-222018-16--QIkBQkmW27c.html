review on the hair that I am currently
wearing as you can see which is from my
favorite hair company she in the same
Emporium now a lot of you guys asked me
a lot of times in my videos especially
with the last hair that I had in um can
I do a review on the curls that I was
doing it or whatever so I'm gonna do
tutorial it's not gonna be exact thing
because obviously I'm wearing my hair
differently but it's the same concept um
which is how I got this hair which
didn't fail and everything else but I'll
probably put pictures or whatever how it
looked when I first did it but it's been
a long day long um yeah oh this hair
that I haven't is a body wave texture
this is not the original texture that it
came with although it did kind of look
like this when I first unraveled it out
of the bundles but this actually was
done with the curling iron and flexi
rods this is how I didn't read curl it
today this is how I did it yesterday
with the flexi rods and this is how it
came out today but I have in four
bundles um and my longest length is 22
and then it's 20 18 and a 16 and of
course I put them in as they went in
chronological order and it's on a new
part so this is actually a u part that I
have in right now it's not it's not you
know my hair with some leave out in the
back or whatever only pout I have is
actually right here but everything else
is sewn up and what I did was because I
noticed that a lot of times when I want
to wear my hair like this and since I
have to press my hair and when you press
your hair what happens is you take all
of the the value mount it's just
straight and since I needed some value
up in this area to make this look
exactly like I wanted to I put my you
part onto right here and then right here
there are four braids or was two braids
on each side and they have single tracks
on them
and I'll make sure that I put one as
close as I could but not right here
because I don't want the volume there
I'm gonna the volume here as you can see
so I wanted it to do that so those two
tracks although they're so down really
flat they still give me volume that I
need and you know the pieces on the side
that I need and I really really want but
everything lays really really flat and
this is the U part that I just took off
that I was wearing in my previous videos
with the Lana Del Rey as you can see
this is the one that I had on and
basically you just get a regular dome
cap I will give you the link to someone
else's videos cuz I honestly don't feel
like doing one um a tutorial on how I do
mines because there's it's no different
from anybody else's you get a dome cap
you take a white eyeliner you pretty
much on the couch you mark out what you
want
you basically slow down and you probably
those guidelines and you cut it off this
actually was a side part so it looked
more like this on my head then how this
one is and it goes around like that
so it actually went at the angle because
my part and everything was right here
but this hair was my 28-inch hair was is
my 28-inch i love this hair it's staying
on this u part because this is a good
you part and yeah this hair is really
good I have this hair in and I was
washing it every to know I was co
washing it every week but I was washing
it every two weeks no every three weeks
and I had it in for six months or four
months or something like that I had to
see her for a long time I she sent it to
me in the beginning of the year because
I was supposed to put this hair in for
New Year's and I I didn't end up doing
it um but yeah this hair has definitely
held up it gives me no problems I get a
little bit of shedding just at a night
when I think a little bit I mean like
can you see the little you probably
can't see it's very minimal and I
actually cut the tracks
I don't fold these because I find that
when I fold them I don't like my hair to
be big some people like to wear their
hair big I don't this is the biggest you
probably ever
see my hair unless it's like big hair or
curly but our SuperDuper curly you know
like didn't tie curls but if in my hair
straight which I was pretty much wearing
this in a way it was like a loose
straight like this and I had the part on
the side I needed it to be flat so I
find that no matter how hard I like of
us a sway how hard I fold the tracks it
still is not flat it's light enough to
my liking and the actual wefts are white
you know they're thin not thin where
it's like you ain't got enough here but
it's thin where they're gonna work out
here's a piece of hair as you can see
this is what it looked like when I got
it and this is what the weft looks like
so the left is actually really good it's
no problems and you know it doesn't
there were no loose strands or anything
when I put it in so yeah I want it
shorter hair that's why I had I was like
I really want something sure because it
is hot and I'm just lighting helping but
this is 28 inches of hair and this is
five bundles of hair so yeah it gets
pretty hot so compare this to this
that's a big difference so that's why I
want it shorter hair and I want it it
takes me longer to curl all of that hair
than it does to take this that used to
take about an hour this takes about
thirty minutes
what about 20 minutes actually you don't
take that long especially since I've
been putting flexi rods in it but I kind
of had to get the shape that I want it
first before I actually kind of settled
on the style but I really like this now
so you're gonna keep saying this so just
get over it um back I can wear this hair
straight if I chose to you know wear it
straight there's no problems
Mico washed it beforehand I did not dye
the hair because my hair is brown and
since my my hair is actually probably
about the same color as the hair I
didn't want it I want it black but from
here it looks black here you can tell
it's brown but it's summer why not maybe
for the winter I'll go darker but for
right now I don't want to dye my hair
and dye my hair in the past four years
my real hair so I'm not trying to
she started doing that a game because my
hair is in a really good condition so
I'm happy
um so yeah I will do a tutorial on these
these loose waves that I have these
pearls waves whatever you want to call
it um yeah I love this hair though you
guys like I have to say and everybody
who was purchased from her um has said
the same thing that they love the hair
like it's nothing to say wrong about it
I haven't never had any issues or known
anyone have any issues with this hair
her side is actually still down so if
you want to order again listen to me if
you want to order please contact her
either via Twitter or I mean Twitter
Facebook I mean
Twitter hold on Twitter Instagram or her
email address but now put all the
information in the below bar but yeah I
love this hair it's soft is silky like
it gives you that commercial feel where
you can just you know yourself but um
yeah I love it so yeah um this is my
initial review review review that I
really really love this hair and I'm
gonna come back and do another review
probably like in another I'll say about
two weeks and see how it's holding up
but I'm sure it's gonna be perfect cuz
this hair never gives me an issue but um
yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this and
make sure you stay tuned for some more
videos I also wanted to say this and I
want to thank Sheena and everybody is
she is hearing poignant because every
time she sends me air it always comes
with a card but it also comes with a
personalized message on the back which i
think is great they have the best
customer service whenever you get a
package it always clean and a pink case
like this and it always comes each
bundle is in one of these one of these
plastic slips like this oh yeah I love
this hair and I love the fact that they
take pride and their customers and they
actually talk to their customers they
don't just treat you like a number like
who you want some hair here's your hair
get out of here date it's good quality
here they nice people and this is
I get contacted all the time to do hair
reviews and I always say no and the
reason why I say no is because if this
seems is that the company wants to force
me to say something I don't want to do
or try and portray something that I
don't feel like it's proper or it's real
or it's I'm not gonna do it so trust me
you're never gonna see me review
something especially hair that I don't
believe in and I believe in shootings
hair emporium and everyone over there so
shout out to you guys and yeah I just
had to come back and say that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
