getting back into the swing of things if
you guys hear any noise the kids are
like playing so you know kind of live as
day but yeah I wanted to make sure the
first one of the first videos I did was
the review for this hair from Sheena's
hair emporium because y'all y'all just
do not understand how great this area is
like you just don't get it you see all
of that movement you know when your hair
moves so greatly it's just nice you know
I don't feel like I have a weave because
I feel like I'm still myself like this
is still my natural hair you know
because it's it's in great condition I
know all people gonna add stuff cause
you have all this hair why would you get
a weap I will explain that in the midst
of this video but first I want to get to
the specs of the hair the hair is I have
24 2018 and 16 inches um the reason why
I decided to get a weave is because a
lot of you guys know that are on my
facebook or my Twitter or whatever the
situation is that I had a situation
where on I used to our part on this side
if you guys have been watching my videos
you know I will always come here on this
side I had a situation where I sizzled
off the front piece of my hair about a
year ago and it still is growing back
but it's not where I wanted to be at
this point um and also you guys know
that I was very interested in some curly
hair because it's the summertime and I
wanted some curly hair or whatever the
situation is so I was like you know I
really want to see you know if they're
any good curly hair out there for me
because I don't like the hair where it's
supposed to be curly but it's really
wavy I see that all the time and I watch
a lot of people on YouTube so I'm you
know I know better
um being a hair stylist I'm also very
aware of when something is not what
they're you know advertising today
so as I've been on YouTube for all this
time a lot of companies would hit me up
and be like Oh what kind of hair is that
or I'd be like well it's not no hair is
actually it's from my roots you know
just to let you know and they like oh
we're sorry would you you know would you
like to review and I always with the
client and say you know every possible
hair company has hit me up um in my
inbox about doing a review on Sam and
I'm always decline I came across a
youtuber named Morgan she's a beautiful
young lady she has some really pretty
curly hair and I'm like ready to get the
hair because it was it was actually
curly it was not wavy so she's like you
know I got a from Shiva's hair before um
which is a company I had not really
heard of I heard of her once or twice
but not really where it wasn't one of
those companies where every time you
click on a hair video is from that
company like that you know so I'm just
like you know this that's some really
pretty hair let me hit her up and see
what our prices are um we got to discuss
it or whatever and I was just like you
know if you want me to do a review I can
actually do a review for for the hair
because I wanted to do more hair
tutorials but I'm not willing to burn
out my hair to do them so it's easier
for me to do 40 different styles with
this hair and then I still be okay
versus having my real hair just burnt to
a crisp because I'm trying to do
tutorials you know it's when you have a
lot of hair and you start to do that
you're gonna start to see the reflection
which happened to me so I was like I
want some curly hair but I also want to
be with able to wear it straight because
I feel as if if you're paying top dollar
for some hair and better do everything
that you want it better back flip it
better do everything that you wanted to
do and then some because if it doesn't
where's your money going you know saying
like you're kind of wasting your money
at this point
so you guys are probably looking right
now and seeing on your screen that there
is a picture of this hair straighten and
it is a picture of it curly and I feel
the hair to me it's really soft which
you know compared to like pack hair you
know that beautiful I'm here
well the more bundles you put in the
heavier is gonna start to get and you
know this hair does not get you know you
have some hair and it rats up the back
of your neck right here get stuck when
you have on
this hair does not do that at all it's
very flowy is very soft it's very light
it's not heavy I have in
three-and-a-half bundles um of hair I
can fit some more tracks in here if I
really really wanted to but I didn't
want it to be too thick because that's
when you start to get problems with it
even if it is good here it will start to
get stuck because it's just so much hair
that you have going on so um I decided
to get a weave because you guys know
I've said in previous videos you know I
may have a couple of tracks in the back
or whatever the situation is you guys
know I have been in brazed for four
years for four years for eight I
probably took a break probably in
between every let go for like a week or
so the two weeks at the max and I will
go straight back to my braids when I
first started wearing braids my hair
probably was about right here
my real hair now is the same length as
here probably a little shorter cuz I did
just get a trim on mine so my real hair
probably stop about here and that's
because of those braids I let them go I
um you know I let it do it once I got my
hair done every two weeks because I got
a really dry scalp which is really nasty
I mean it flakes up and all of that good
stuff so you know having your hair
parted into a style it will start to
show after about a good week and a half
and I did that for five years straight
so being somebody who was so accustomed
to braids when I came out of braids my
hair was really really really healthy
and you guys know if you were on my
other facebook before I got deleted um
that I have when I had my 24th birthday
I wore my hair similar to this and um it
was really pretty I got accustomed to
wearing my hair like that and in doing
that it was soon it was the wear and
tear on my hair it really was because I
don't have a relaxer so my natural
thickness you know was I'm noticing that
it's not there really anymore I mean
it's still there but it has more of a
looser curl I still want my hair to be
as it was when I had my braids I don't
want my curl pattern to start to loosen
up because that's when your hair starts
to break because if this is all
baby and this is all nappy and you have
that line of demarcation the hair is
gonna start to break right there so
that's not what I want so I said what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna give my hair
rest put it back in some braids but
instead of wearing the other braids I'm
wearing my weave now plus it's easier to
me it's pretty still get what I want
without killing minds you know I'm
saying that's like when you get a car
and you put like a cover over the car
you know you don't have to do it but in
order to preserve the paint that's what
you do when you get a car and you put
seat covers on it ain't nothing wrong
with the seat but you don't want nothing
to be wrong with the seat so you know I
just basically put a seat cover over my
hair so that my hair can stay okay when
I got in so before I got into beauty
school my hair was jacked up it was
burnt it was it was dry it was terrible
when I got into beauty school I really
started to take care of my hair when I
left while I was there that was a
different story because we had all of
this stuff we had you know all these
products that we could basically use I
used and my hair was terrible so when I
got out of beauty school I went straight
into leaves and you know I was wearing
every type of hair that you could you
know imagine but my hair was starting so
grow and then I went into the brace and
then when I got into YouTube my hair
just started to grow and it kept growing
and it kept growing and kept growing and
I was so proud like dang my hair is
really gonna people are asking me you
know what are you doing to help your
hair grow like what are you putting in
and I'm like I'm not putting none I'm
just leaving it alone like I'm letting
it do what it's supposed to do naturally
and if you start to do that your hair
will grow so that's why I say I'm gonna
go back to the Wiis because that little
piece I burnt off has grown back not all
the way but it's pretty long now
compared to what it was when I first did
it and I just need to get my hair rif
now the top section that I left out it's
fine it never gives me issues or
anything of that nature because there's
accustomed to being straightened but the
rest of my hair in the back is so hot
right now
that if I really really really really
really you know went outside and just
sat there my
Roots would be this pick when I was done
you know so with it being as hot as it
is in California right now the last
thing I need is to be pressing in flat
iron Maori later like for real because
this little section right here cool no
problem but the all this in the back of
my head would be so poufy right now and
it would be so big because it's so not
accustomed to being you know all pressed
out in this heat so I say you know what
I want to do something a little
different so I had my hair stylist 20
shirts sew me up ooh and I y'all I am so
stitched up like I can't even do this
all the way um I got my hair done about
two days ago um and I probably have my
it's like an L shape right here so all
of this is still mines all of this at
the top primer from here to here is
still mines my oh my
brakes start right here it goes all the
way around and then there's three tracks
in here so I'm actually still in this
section it just has a little bit of help
in order to blend down here because my
hair on this side is shorter than it is
when it's in this eye so you notice that
my part used to be here and I switched
it um so yeah it's beautiful hair it's
really beautiful her she's really cool
her site is Sheena hair Emporium calm um
her site actually is happy she's being a
heavy reconstructed right now but you
still can order hair if you email her
which is as Sheena's hair emporium at

hair i have the indian curly hair that I
Flatiron to mate straight when you first
get it is probably gonna look something
like this it's gonna be you know curly
and it's really pretty it's the ring lik
nice curls when you get it so when this
was first put in and it was still curly
it was a nice pretty Bush okay so yeah
it's it's some nice hair the ends are
not dry when you get them you know some
people you get hair cuz I do people say
all the time and they'll bring your hair

conditioner hair with the hair so it's
just like you know so yes
