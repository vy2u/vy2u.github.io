okay so I'm gonna do something today
that I've normally don't do and that is
a halt because I usually do reviews or
talk about something has to do with life
or whatever the situation is but today
we're gonna do a haul so before I get
started alcohol I want to say that this
Louboutin necklace that I do have on it
was made from in B's closet and
everything that you usually see that is
custom that I wear is usually for every
club in B's closet I've been working
with them for years so you know there
was them as my homies so check them out
and today I'm gonna do a shoe haul
because I post a lot of pictures of
shoes on my Instagram and stuff like
that and he will always ask me like
where did you get them what size do you
wear this is that any other so I'm gonna
just go through I got four pairs of
shoes and you should have brought rent
within the last month or so some of them
probably like a little bit longer or
whatever and basically these shoes range
between 14.99 to $200 so you know
they're either at that price point or
further down into $200 nothing is over
that much so i'ma start with a pair of
shoes that are Steve Maddens and I got
these shoes from Ross and when I seen
the shoes I really liked them the only
issue that I had with the shoes is the
fact that they were dirty at the soles
now I don't know what's going on with
these designers lately but they have
been making a lot of shoes with the
shoes already come as if they are been
worn I don't want a pair of shoes to the
designers that may pop somebody watch
this don't make dirty cuz I don't
want it if it's I want my shoes to look
brand new I like my shoes to stay
looking brand new I don't want a dirty
pair of shoes but these are the shoes
that I found that Ross and when I first
got them all of this around here was
super dirty like it was like somebody
had walked a mile in my shoes literally
so I was like I don't really necessarily
know so I would I didn't know if they
were supposed to look like this I used
to work at Ross so I know a lot of times
we would get stuff in stock and I would
put the stuff on the shelves and they've
been drug through the back and
everything else so you know who knows
what have happened with that situation
so I went on
I to look up the shoes and they indeed
they did come dirty like that's just how
the own Steve Madden site that's how
they look so I was just like okay well
I'm not really a fan of that I wonder if
I can get him off now I had when I was
working at Ross years ago I have brought
a pair of Converse and the converse were
they they they were dirty at the bottom
and I took the SOS pad and got the dirt
off or whatever so this is how the shoes
look now versus how they looked when I
first you know first got him they were
14.99
I looked on the Steve Madden site and
online and there are places telling
these shoes for as much as I think
$89.99 and the the suggested retail
price was a hundred and I think ten
dollars or something like that but
they're comfortable I've worn once you
probably can't tell but I did wear them
once they're comfortable they have a
zipper on the side so you don't have to
undo your laces in order to get in the
shoes which you will see kind of a
repetitive thing with these shoes that
I'm about to show you because I like
this because I hate happen to undo my
shoe strings when I'm doing perfect but
this one ain't perfect just a little
wonky but when it looked like this one
you know I want them to stay like that I
wear a size seven these are six and a
half and they actually fit so some shoes
will fluctuate in size depending on who
the designer is so these I really really
like I think they're really really cute
and they're comfortable which is good I
like shoes that are cute but comfortable
if they hurt so yeah these shoes are
very comfortable I like them I wear them
usually with probably shorts or
something like that nothing too major
but you know just something simple love
the price on the shoes because the
retail price is ridiculous
they're very light and that's what I
like they're light and comfortable so
yeah those are $14.99 from Ross they
might have a major local Ross I don't
know how long they have been there but
you know the next shoes are very similar
to a pair of Giuseppe Zanotti tennis
shoes that I wanted I have a pair that
were given to me but they're a little
too big so I never wear them but
Giuseppe is known for the zippers on the
side and the patent leather and suede
they're just really Google a pair Cassie
has wore them there's a lot of amore on
has that up here there they're really
cute they're just 700 and some odd
dollars which I'm not gonna do like I'll
go up soon I think my limit for a pair
of shoes is like 400 dollars then at
that point is just like I can't
with you like I don't see the shoe being
and I only would pay 400 ollars for a
pair of shoes that were either exclusive
or custom-made for me or I could they
were like like Barbie or something like
that's the only reason why I would
actually get a pair of shoes for that
much but these shoes look very much like
the Giuseppe's but I got them from
forever 21 and they look like this and
the zippers on both sides actually work
on the other shoes the oh no I guess it
wasn't sitting well yeah these are the
ones I haven't wore them yet but I did
try them on these are 8 I was 7 but I've
noticed that with forever21 shoes they
tend to run small so I was I seen these
back in November when I first put them
up and they had him like as an example
picture or whatever but the issue that
I'm having took the thing off but the
the issue with the shoes was the fact
that I didn't know what size I tried
these on at the forever 21 in Hollywood
and my size was just too small I tried
on an 8 at the time and I just seemed
like they just didn't fit right they
hurt and I was like okay I can't it's
not that they're cute but they're not
i'ma make my Flickr cute there's a
different you know understand like you
know the shoes that hurt but then you
like they so bomb I don't care no these
wasn't it but I love these shoes because
I did need to tear a pair of 10 shoes
and the zipper on this shoe is just like
the other one it zips on the side so you
don't have to mess with this at all
which I love and I believe that this
zipper on this side yeah the zipper on
this light actually works
which I don't really would see the point
of taking this one down but if that's
what you choose to do with yourself
that's what you choose to do your shoes
also these shoes are at forever 21 for
3680
so I think with tax and everything was
like $40 I would have
they're really cute they're very
comfortable they're very cute for the
summer if you want that Giuseppe Zanotti
feel what I happen to play he paid that
Giuseppe Zanotti money then these would
be a good dupe for those or whatever
they don't have like forever21 like just
that be here and here but we can do is
$36 you know how many pairs of these you
could buy for the price of that one shoe
and it's a good sturdy shoe like I
haven't wore them yet but they are
definitely good quality shoes because I
have some Oxford's from forever 21 and
they actually fit me pretty well and
they've held up I like got more than
like three or four times and they
haven't given me any problems they fit
great they feel great the inside of the
shoe is comfortable it is roomy and you
know the zipper works just fine there
you don't get stuck this one might get
stuck just because I don't really think
this is made for to be I think it's just
poor design it just works you know but
you know whatever
um yeah but these are cute so a lot of
people were asking me on Instagram where
I got these from and they were from
forever 21 and they had them on the site
just get a size bigger than you usually
were so if you were seven get at eight
if you were eight get a nine and if you
were an on get a 10 and I don't think
they go to 11 so you can be asked out
but they have a some black ones y'all
I've seen some black ones when I went to
the store I went to the one in a
Crenshaw mall which I never go to but
they had some black ones like this I
have to get the black ones like yes I
was tempted but I didn't want to go and
just spend $80 on shoes that day because
I just been behind she was like crazy
tried to live in myself but these I love
ok these are by far my favorites because
of the simple fact that they were so
inexpensive they have a great build to
them which I love and it feels like I
did spin and they look like I spent a
lot of money on these shoes and I didn't
so shout out to forever 21 for finally
getting it right um the next pair of
shoes that I want to talk about are
these shoes that are not for everybody
but they I love them due to the simple
fact that they're so mean and you guys
know if you know anything about me and I
like very whimsical colors you know like
today I'm pretty demure although I have
my colors is not
I usually be like I'd be right but these
shoes are my Jeremy Scott teddy bear
shoes that everybody was asking me about
on Instagram and Twitter and these are
Jeremy Scott through adidas and these
are a size there are seven and a half
they fit a little big on me because I
didn't have when I went to the store
they didn't have a seven so I just got a
seven and a half thinking it wasn't
gonna be a big difference and it's
really not it's just a little more room
than I would like but I these are not a
pair of shoes I wear every day still it
really don't matter you know but um I
love these there my friend has the
Jeremy Scott bones in the box that comes
in like this be like yeah it's huge
but I love them I get a lot of
compliments they're very comfortable
shoes these are biddies to be really
good for the wintertime I mean just
don't wear them a rain sleet and snow
and I think you'll be okay
but um yeah I love these shoes to death
there is nothing wrong with them Jeremy
Scott did his thing with these I love
Jeremy's guy cuz he speaks to me as a
fashion person like I like things that
are different in an awesome box but
still comfortable and cute and these are
it my friend had she wanted these and
she brought some replicas and I don't
have an issue with people buying real
because if they can't find with a one
I've done it before
um but she brought these in the replica
version they look like roadkill like he
looks exciting he like his Pleasant
doesn't he looks like he said harsh it
is like like it looks terrible so yeah
watch out for that like you just look at
it if you're gonna get some fake ones
make sure that they are a good dude but
um these are the retail price produce
are $200 which is a little steep for
some people they don't feel like imma
spend $200 on a pair of teddy bear
you know tennis shoes but to me they
were worth it and they're cute they're
gonna last me a long time and like again
I said these are not a pair of shoes I
wear every day but every blue moon I
like every month I'll pull these out and
wear I'm probably oh maybe um we'll see
what happens but yeah I love the
and there's I get compliments on this
little boy I was trying to play with him
the other day at Macy's and I went to
slap him in his damn mouth but your mama
I can get your child yeah I get your
child ma'am so these are my favorites
another one of my favorites because
they're so adorable like they just it's
like having a teddy bear with you all
the time on your feet but um no I love
these I wanted their original ones that
came in brown and pink but of course my
little bitty feet they sold out before I
had a chance to do anything so I didn't
really get those but I am very happy
with these and he has some Sparkle ones
coming out so shout out to Jeremy Scott
cuz I love these um and the last pair of
shoes that I want to show you guys are
these shoes and these are my Jeffrey
Campbell I think these are called the
atom sneakers and these couch okay we're
gonna get to that in a second these
spikes on this shoe are very very very
sharp and they do hurt I took my leg
under my foot no time in my car and my
ass got a surprise so yeah these
actually are spiked they're not dulled
down they really hurt they can be
dangerous and if you want to kick a
bitch in the mouth you can do that so
watch yourself if you get these um they
have again the zipper that I'm just such
a fan of with these designers these days
the zipper it's kind of it's quilted in
the inside it has Jeffrey Campbell um in
the inside as well and I don't have to
mess up my laces this side I don't
believe ya this I is not like those
forever 21 this one does not come down I
tried it to about here
and then it just doesn't move after that
so this is again for decoration it's not
meant for you to actually take down the
shoe these are a seven these are
actually on Karmaloop right now for a
hundred and I think $48 if I'm not
mistaken so they're actually very
affordable for some people other people
feel like I'm not paying that much for
those shoes so yeah these are very
affordable shoes I'll
of these and they're they're comfortable
they're very very much comfortable
they're easy put on the leather is very
very good quality I love that and um I
don't have anything bad to say about
them these are the gold the thing is one
of my spikes are missing right here so I
have to be careful I have to get a
replacement because I accidentally
kicked something and I think I didn't
break it it just came off but they do
screw off so you can be very sorry I got
a package um but yeah so yeah I love
these and um there's really no I like I
like Jeremy Scott but I also like just
be Campbell due to the simple fact they
both are designers that speaks to me
this is more of a sleek chic shoe that I
could wear I've wore these with like a
black jacket all black jeans a black
shirt with all gold accessories and kill
the game you know it's just guilty
you'll see what my weave is like real
popping you know this is perfect so if
you need that this is the the thing that
you should go for if you want something
sleek but still different it stands out
it's just not a regular tennis shoe so
yeah I love these today
so yeah those are basically all the
shoes that I have to show today these
are some wore shoes from a replica site
that they actually sent me and I'm gonna
do a review on these shoes as well
because some of these shoes are very
pricey and some people do not believe in
paying top dollar for a pair of tennis
shoes so this is more like a high-end
you know mid Paul this will be a more
low in more affordable huh for those who
be like I'm not paying it I get you I
got you all the shoes that I did show
you though are not from a company these
are all purchased from me with my own
money
and I just wanted to do something a
little bit different for those who have
been asking me to do a haul or some some
sort of haul based on the fashions and
the things that I'm into at this
particular moment so everything that I
showed you is great for the summer
nightlife regular life mid life lunch
dinner whatever so I hope you guys
enjoyed this and I will talk to you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
