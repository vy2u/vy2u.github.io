head you know wrong but today I came to
do review for sure now before I get
started
she doesn't does not sponsor this review
this isn't my own personal review
brought my own personal honey just for
anybody's you know I do review so I
don't people to think that in ShoeDazzle
sponsored this or whatever but I didn't
want to do this review for a couple of
reasons um and they're all good reasons
so don't think this is like a bad review
or something cuz actually it is
incredibly good and for me to have
brought these with my own shoot I mean
anyway okay so I was watching the
commercial the UM the shootouts of
commercial and you know they have the
damn song that I don't that song is on
everything whoever sings that hole is
getting paid but anyway um I've seen
some like Giuseppe Zanotti looking shoes
or whatever you guys know I love things
with embellishments and zippers and all
types of stuff and I've seen some shoes
that kind of look like though so I was
like hmm I wonder if I could find him so
I found some on a site like them but the
soles were a little on the thin side for
me and I don't like shoes that got thin
soles like at all it cuz he just makes
the shoe look so cheap um but it was
cute like it you know cuz in those two
days of commercials they show like 50
pairs of shoes and like less than a
minute so found the shoes kind of didn't
like them what after I seen them you
know they were cute or whatever but just
not they were cute friend but not for
the price let's just say that so I was
just like okay what I'm gonna do is I'm
looking see if they got something else
on my possible like and I found these
shoes and even then looking at those I
was just kind of like okay they're cute
or whatever but I'll get them later cuz
again I didn't like the price for the
shoes so the other day well about a
weekend yeah this is the week before
last I was watching the Kardashians and
something just told me to get on
ShoeDazzle or whatever got on ShoeDazzle
singer shoes and they were on sale they
were on sale for 30
no they were on sale for there were 50
something originally the name was 230
but since I was a new member and I had
never brought anything and brought my
sorta down to like
twenty seven dollars and son okay
definitely gonna get them so on the side
it just tell you that she should order a
size larger if because they don't have
half sizes so if you were seven in half
which in some cases I do for some
certain shoes and sometimes to be on the
safe side
I'll just get a seven and a half instead
of getting a seven if they are too big
or they do you know like it's in space
or whatever I'll just put on a pair of
socks
um look at I read they have it shoes to
be a little too big than a little too
small because a little too small is
disrespectfully hurtful to your feet so
I went on put them on went on ordered
them or whatever
I got a step eight so they came they I
found out they shipped from Ontario
California and since I'm in Los Angeles
California
then I got the shoes I ordered them
Sunday night and they came Tuesday
morning so literally a day and that was
regular shipping or whatever and I don't
know how it would be if you were you are
in the world wherever you may be but for
me it took that amount of time so I got
the shoes try them on and they did not
fit and I was so hurt because I had
planned on wearing the shoes and
everything goes and so I think that
because the shoes were on clearance that
whatever on sale that there were no
returns or whatever so I was just like
oh my god like I wanna be stuck with a
pair of shoes that I really like but I
can't I mean I could get my foot in them
but they do hurt they would date I made
that mistake when I was like and going
on my pastry phase and I brought a pair
of pastries and the wrong size and the
answer will birth did that and it was so
unfortunate for our feet so I was trying
to figure out like what am I gonna do so
I contacted them they were the nicest
they gave no issues they said don't
worry about it will issue you a return
slip just take the same box that it was
shipped in put the shoes back in print
out all of the stuff that we're gonna
send you put it in the box and don't
worry about it and what you think you
would you know we'll send you your size
that you need and I was like really like
y'all
like I was really surprised at the time
because their their shipping is free
there and back so if you don't like them
or they don't fit or whatever you can't
but usually not for sale items anywhere
you go if it's on sale they like you
can't return it
so I was just like okay so that I didn't
have a shoes for an hour so come back to
the post office they took they send them
to FedEx the kind of thing that I didn't
like is because the return is not as
fast as the shipment so I shipped it
back on a Tuesday and even get it to
Friday and then on Monday I got an email
saying that they shipped my new pair of
shoes out and I got them Tuesday today
is Wednesday so it came and of course
the ShoeDazzle box it comes in this box
or whatever 30 bucks
it doesn't come in the pink ShoeDazzle
box like the other shoes come in and as
you can see here it says white gold
imagine eight and I took one of the
shoes out already but when I seen him I
was like oh my god I have got to have
one but these are the shoes and they are
so cute I love the gold embellishment
Berry's Giuseppe um it has a strap a go
strap in the back and one right here
these this hard this gold heart was it's
plastic it's not like metal or anything
for those who are wondering cuz I was
like but no they're not metal they're
plastic and they do fit perfectly they
don't hurt they are my size and they
actually come in black so I'm tempted to
get some black ones but the reason why I
got these cuz I'm just wanting some
really cute sleek white shoes and the
reason why the other ones did not fit
properly is because you see like this
back part this is not a wedge sneaker
for those are about 2x a that's kind of
got that wedge look right here
but it's actually just a regular sneaker
but it is that hard and you own like a
pair of Chuck Taylors you know what I
mean where it's like hard right here so
this part does rub up it will rub up
against your foot if it's not the right
size that's why I couldn't keep the
other ones um and it were tight so yeah
um sent them perfect pair of shoes great
these remind me
a little bit of my Louboutins at the
bottom I'm meeting a red but you know
what I mean like the the sole part
reminds me of my Louboutins and the
style of the shoe reminds me of my you
guys know my black and go Jeffrey
Campbell's with the spikes right here
that's what they remind me they come in
black and the reason why I didn't get
them in black is because they are very
reminiscent of a pair of shoes of course
that I already have so yeah I love these
I have yet to wear them but I did try
the morning to make sure that they fit
and stuff like that so I will definitely
be sure on my Twitter and my Instagram
which is at Malibu Dollface I did post a
picture and after I got my shoes I did
tweet and I did thank ShoeDazzle for a
nice easy transaction and that's one of
the most important things as the company
is that when you actually have a you
know you have people buying things and
things don't work out and you can
replace them seamlessly with no problems
is great because when did when it
happened and I tweeted about it they
tweeted me back and said don't worry did
it a lot but I ended up calling and kind
of get it a little bit quicker than you
know the tweet situation but they were
great like they are a excellent company
I was so suggested these shoes again our
coffee imagine they are on sale so your
shoes are probably like $27 with mines
too and they come in black as well and I
think they go to a size 11 so I'm gonna
thank everybody over at ShoeDazzle for
just having great customer service again
I brought everything with my own money I
did not this is not a sponsorship but I
did have to say this because it's very
rare today to get a company who actually
cares about their customers and has
great customer service so again thank
you guys so much for watching if you
have any questions feel free to hit me
up at the bottom now to talk to you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
