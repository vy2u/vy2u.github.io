haven't really been and then I got sick
hmm um I had got a backhoe cuz I the
Arab guy so anyway I since I moved I
haven't been able to like really commit
myself to my videos like I wanted to I
gotta catch up on my hair reviews but
just any life topic videos like we were
talking about right now I just haven't
been able to do so recently well
recently this morning I woke up with
this afternoon let's correct that I woke
up and there was a story on the shade
room that I popped it on the shaver
before you know I'm just playing but I
bet I have but not for shady reasons you
know I love them over there they're all
cool you know say they're not like you
know mediatek oh but anyway it was a
story that a transsexual model or
actress I don't know um had released um
information about her and Tyga's
three-year relationship that she was
going on with him that I now we've heard
this song and dance befo because we've
heard it would Hank Baskett we've heard
it with um Eddie Murphy you know saying
this just seems to be like a thing in
Hollywood okay and he did y'all know
I've been on mediatakeout linking linked
to people that I never had sex with
kissed or anything and they're saying
you know do you done this you know a
rumor can have legs if you let it
okay so the reason why wants to do this
video is because I think that people who
expose celebrities are just whack and
thirsty like I honestly feel that way
because here's the thing if Tyga and
mind you I am NOT a tiger fan by a
longshot he used to go to high school my
sister are in a rage so they run high
school together and then I met him
during his lime in the coconut days at
MTV because he was with Travis McCoy
from Gym Class Heroes and he was very
just not my type of person but give or
take whatever he has a beautiful song
with blac Chyna
I like blac Chyna I think she called she
follow me on Instagram so they were
saying well she she was saying that the
reason why mind you she'd been on Swale
morning in she's making her rounds
doing this smear campaign
because I guess he promised her some
money in and she didn't get it or
whatever and now here's the thing if you
are a person cuz she said she was a
stylist of some sorts um and I'm it is
no shade towards her I don't know her I
don't know anything that she's done or
probably will do for that matter I don't
know but here's my thing there are a lot
of dudes and I'm just gonna be very
frank with y'all there's a lot of dude
stray dudes and then there's a lot of
celebrity dudes who end up in my DMS on
Instagram or on Twitter and it's been
happening for years I don't mess with
famous dudes
I don't entertain them in any sorts
because I feel like um if you want
somebody to be your secret you need to
find somebody who's a little you know a
little gullible because I feel like if
you don't have your own then what you're
going to do is you're going to be like
well if I mess with him I have dirt on
him so if you don't give me what I want
I can blackmail him into you bone dry
that's what I take from it I'm not one
of those people I have my own I work
very hard for what I have but I don't
need to do or any of his money to pretty
much be that that catalyst to keep me in
giuseppe's and keep me you know in my
skin oh because I can't do it myself I'm
just not that type of person so a lot of
times you know I know a lot of stuff
about a lot of people and I just don't
say because it's not my business and my
whole thing is you wasn't telling the
people when y'all was doing what I was
doing you wasn't telling him when he was
giving you the money that she was
getting as soon as you get mad you know
you want to act on scoring and say well
he's doing this and we've done this and
this is this and this is this and I'm
like you know at the end of the day he
made his decisions whether it's true or
not because I don't know but he's made
his decisions but he does have a child
and I know y'all who should have thought
about that before he did what he did
that's true but at the same time this is
a child involved and you I should really
watch what you say and how you say it
because the child is gonna always have
to look at that like the things just
don't go away the internet doesn't mean
race it only just stores and remembers
everything and yeah he should've did his
dirt if he was doing dirt a little bit
lower you know that he was doing I guess
the whole Kylie thing was cooling and he
was just like I'm just gonna really go
wow
you know saying and it's what's going on
on the side but a lot of girls um think
that some of their favorite rappers and
actors and athletes and stuff like that
are straight because that's what they
present to the world but you have to
understand if a dude is getting pussy
left and right from girls he's gonna
eventually want to try something else it
may look like a female if you know if it
may be a reminiscent of that but it may
be something a little bit different that
females don't have and that's where they
usually go
I get all types of messages from dudes
on a regular basis and they range from
teenage boys all over - OH - men and I'm
always just like can you just get on my
inbox please one you too young - you -
oh and three you got a baby mama so I'm
not gonna do that
okay I just think that what you go out
of your way to expose a person for what
they're doing
it's like robbing a bank with your
friend and then once your friend y'all
got your money and you spend all your
money and the afraid still has a little
change left from the bank that y'all
robbed or the story that y'all robbed
and then you decide well if you don't
give me any money I'm going to tell the
world that we were the ones who did it
because what she the model-actress
whoever or whatever she does what she
doesn't get is like divine Brian the
girl who was caught second Rupert
Everett's dick what's happening um I
think so but you just google her okay
she's gonna always be known as that ho
uh V whenever the girl the ugly girl who
with the visor she's gonna always be
known as old dude's little side chick
Monica Lewinsky will forever be known as
the bitch who sucked the president's
dick that's it
you're not the people whose fame is so
distorted now where people think that as
long as I'm famous for something I'm
getting somewhere in life if you want to
be an actress if you want to have a
business these are issues and problems
that you can never shake like people are
going to remember you for this for the
rest of your life so remember to make
your impressions to the world very very
very very very good and important
because if you do not know you're very
careless with it you're going to end up
with a
I can see that you really just don't
want you know there are people in this
world who've done porn and pose nude and
all this stuff and then they try to go
on to have a better life and every time
they say one thing all those things come
flooding back to them and they like why
do I have to keep being known as this
person or a mistake or something that I
did so many years ago so I just feel if
a celebrity if a regular dude if you are
a trans girl if you gain whatever don't
don't do that
that's just whack as hell because what
you have to understand about somebody
who's very who's doing that behind
closed doors there's reasons behind why
they're doing what they're doing but
ever do does me wrong and he just
happens to be an athlete okay let's just
say that right and he still does me
wrong or I do him wrong or we're not no
longer together and I'm mad and he's mad
there's no point in me going out and
telling the world because eventually
what he's doing he's gonna run into the
wrong person and then they're gonna do
it you know I'm saying anyway but if you
want something more because what she
from my understanding she's a model
she's a fashion stylist or I don't know
I don't know exactly what her occupation
is only thing I know is she's going
around doing all of these these
interviews about her relationship with
Charlie Sheen and Tyga and this is I
just want y'all to understand this is
very normal in Hollywood this is not
something that's just like oh my god he
sleeps with you know trans girls this is
normal like this is just a normal thing
it's just that some of y'all feed into
the bullshit and the stereotypes and the
facade that is put out and you start to
believe that your favorite rapper actor
singer whoever is really that nigga and
he's not he's really not he has a fetish
he does a lot of other things um you
know you have Hank Baskett who I always
thought was very sweet and very nice and
very outgoing and um he did we did on
Kendra and now their three children are
gonna have to see that you know saying
they're good I think
two or three hours do I have two kids
because it's hang-hang jr. in the in
Elijah but yeah I don't think that uh
just if our leaving him kazeem they she
said they were together for about three
not together but they were messing
around for about three years okay so at
some point in this I know it wasn't just
about the money you had to have to start
half feelings the way she was talking
unless she's just a good you know game
player and she really just but I think
you know she caught feelings and then
this whole thing with Kylie and the him
and Chyna was over and I don't know
again I don't know if he's sure not I
couldn't tell you cuz I don't know but
the only thing I will say is you have to
be very careful on how you handle people
because things are going to come back to
you and some of some of the most
horrible ways because of the things that
you do not saying what he's doing is
okay and not saying that the type of
games that he's playing whether it be
with Kylie Chyna whoever are okay but
you got to be a bigger person at some
point because the industry is very small
and so did you do something that
somebody doesn't like you get
blackballed by everybody it's like me
being a person who has a problem with
somebody and then I go show my ass and
then I try to get a job becoming like
knowing I fucking him because every time
he don't get his way he wants to foul
this he wants to do this he wants to do
that he wants to show his ass he knows
that you know saying he wants to act a
fool because he's not getting his way
that the world doesn't work like that
you know saying you have to play the
game stay in it and then know your
position but again fame it's one of the
most dangerous drugs because it have
people who have nothing believing that
they have the world now because
everybody's talking about them whether
it's good or bad they just like the fact
that people are talking but no price is
backwards true indeed if you are someone
but if you are nobody of a substance or
you don't have anything that's before
this that's are you going to be known as
this that is that simple so yeah I
always thought that the whole I'm going
to expose who you are okay but you still
bad because you are part of this you
working I'm saying you're part of it but
hey don't give or take I don't know if
it's true or not I don't know what
transpired between the two of them but
if you do know someone secret or
somebody has told you things in
confidence they're looking for me there
are things that people that I'm no
longer friends would have told me that I
would never repeat to anybody you know
I'm saying we don't have to be cool but
at some point I did care about you say
at some point I did love you at some
point I wanted you to be a better person
and I wanted nothing but the best for
you I hate your guts now but it's not
gonna make me renege on what I said
which was I'm not going to tell your
business to everybody whose business
it's not period that's all you know so
um yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this I
will be doing a room tour once my room
is completely finished um so don't worry
and then I'll have some more I got some
shoe hauls coming up I got some sales
coming up got a lot going on y'all but I
feel better thank you guys who are
asking me if I'm okay yeah I just had a
really bad hope because my dumb butt was
sitting up there getting out the shower
with the arrow and then I wasn't getting
enough sleep because I was moving so
much stuff talk to y'all but tell me how
y'all feel about that like would you
expose somebody if he was a celebrity
cause he might you know Lenny or more
like let me know
