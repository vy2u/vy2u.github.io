really hard time trying to sleep and
it's not that little a hair it's not
that I don't go to sleep or try to go to
sleep at a decent time on my hours are
like correct it's just that I won't get
sleep it's like two o'clock in the
afternoon by that time I have shit to do
so I really don't know why I'm like why
I can't sleep and I'm also having oh
honey boom I'm also having um this is
still really bad okay let's try to make
this better let me slice look at that
works I'm also having um they're not
night terrors there what is the name of
there
it is when they caught Carl riding when
the witch is writing your something it's
called silly paralysis there we go where
your body feels like it's like paralyzed
and you can't move and every time I have
this happened to me it always be I can
always hear a little girl laughing and I
don't know what I'm trying to scare
nobody but I don't know what the fuck
that shit mean it's like I did I did my
research on sleep paralysis and it did
make a lot of sense but then again yeah
I just don't know what this it I just
want to go to sleep like damn the Sun
about to come out in a minute and not
really pissing up it's raining and it
has a lot to do with it - I have a hard
time trying to either sleep too long in
the rain or don't sleep at all and this
is one of those nights where I'm not
sleeping at all so yes I don't really
know what the issue is but I hope it
gets better soon because it isn't
working
like this is really like all up in my
personal business but it's okay because
finally you guys get the real in wrong
so I thought they need to come to you

give me a chance but it's been raining
really bad so my Lighting's been really
off and I really haven't had much to
talk about so see you guys later and if
