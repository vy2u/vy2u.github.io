people you can't see me but you came
here ok so I told you guys in my last
video that I was going to do a slick
wraps in depth review on this case
matter of fact I like my gloves baby I
feel like Vanna White like this case so
anyway um yeah so basically I want to do
an in-depth review on this particular
skin and I just want to show you guys a
couple of things that you guys get when
you order these these are 1199 if i'm
not mistaken for these these are the
glow-in-the-dark ones and as you can see
it says slick reps at the bottom this is
the packaging that you will be sent it
tells you what it is here it says iphone
4 because i don't think they got any
cases that says iphone 4s which is what
this is this is the side it just has the
labeling on it and this is the back the
back tells you what it comes with it
comes with two side pieces a back piece
and a front piece it comes with it tells
you the purpose of the skin itself
styles protection easy application and
removal so it does not leave any residue
and they are reusable for those who kept
asking in the last um I guess you say
preview video I did and for it has every
single possible of language so this is
very versatile for those who live in
different countries and then we have
here it's the vivid you probably can't
see that very well but it's the vivid
glow in the dark orange case so
basically this is the orange one that I
have
I have this blue one so I'm gonna do
what I did to this one when I put the
pink on this side and the yellow that
was on here that I just recently removed
because I'm about to do this i'm not
going to do it on camera because of the
simple fact that i know it's gonna take
me forever and i'm gonna speed it up and
all of that good stuff I might change my
mind who knows um so yeah I'm going to
do a double application so basically if
you buy two of these that retail for
1199 then you can do what I do and you
can get two different styles so since
I've time about to take this one off the
yellow 1i can use the yellow front I
mean the yellow back and the yellow
front and then I can use the pink on the
sides so yeah um I want to show you guys
when you take it out of the package this
is actually the stainless steel um I'm
excuse me the brush chrome so as you can
see this is definitely not flat just to
let you know like if you do this it's
actually like a texture so what you're
seeing which is really jacked up with
this camera is terrible and my other
camera son has so excuse me but this is
definitely texture and what I like about
this particular one which I don't know
what I'm going to put it on but this one
matches the sides of the phone so
basically it's a AG exact match as far
as color in textures cannot expect
resistance of course it's flat but yeah
so basically excuse that you get this
piece is what the front piece will look
like when you get any of these out of
the packaging the back piece is here you
can take this logo the apple logo you
can take it out if you want to some
people leave them in of course these
have to come out in order for your
camera to work um but I've seen people
do clever things like this
if you buy two and you put this on the
back all day we use this Apple logo on
here to give it a whole well-rounded I
guess you could say cohesive look so
that's another idea I mean the things
are definitely worth the money they're
not expensive so i will do a review on
these and probably measure with this
particular video okay as you can see
this is what it looks like when it's
glowing in the dark and to know this is
not a trick here are my fingers right
here wish you can see this better this
is just a really crappy camera here's
the blue on the side and i want to show
you this side that I did in charge he
had no light on this side so I wanted
you guys to see the difference this side
had no charge the front I don't put no
you know letting it was on its stomach
so this is the bag and this is the side
so imagine your entire phone looking
like this while you're at the club or
something like that this is very cool
especially for younger kids since
everybody has today I'm cell phone now
this is perfect so yeah this was what it
looks like as you see the light is
starting to glow out a little bit
because it really doesn't have only had
the lights on for a matter of about 15
seconds and I'll put them off and yeah
this is what I got so it definitely is
the purpose and it protects your phone
as you can see there's something right
here it could have internship I don't
know yeah just put the phone looks right
now as you can see also when you get
them for those who have a phone they
give you two for the four and the
verizon iphone 4s the verizon iphone 4s
and the four or basically the same
difference it's a world phone now so
they all work with this particular one
but they do give it for those who have
before so I'm assuming that's why this
packaging still says 4 on because you
get both of these because the front
pieces are the same since the phone is
the same difference all right
and here's the last part okay because I
wanted to do this in like sections and
then use stuff and then show you okay
now i apply this orange one with the
blue which is what you just saw in the
glow no dark I just recently just remove
this from my phone now here's the issue
that I just faced when removing this one
which was actually these the blue strips
for the side they left so much residue
on my phone it was not fighting like
seriously and what's funny is that when
I took these off these didn't give me no
issues they came right off residue-free
these are the colorful ones which are
1199 now but glow-in-the-dark ones which
I miss quoted the price earlier in this
video these are 24 99 apiece and the
brush metal is twenty dollars see ya
that's the only issue that I really
occurred that really kind of turned me
off is the fact that it left a lot of
residue I wish it woulda took pictures
of which you can see it was blue all on
the side and it was sticky so I don't
know why that happened I don't know if I
did something incorrect I don't know if
it because my phone got hot um or the
heat from my room maybe that has
something to do with it i'm not sure but
like i said these when i applied this
one originally when I did to
Thanksgiving after Thanksgiving video
this gave me no problems I like
seriously so this the colorful ones that
are 1199 gave me no issues I have yet to
use the brush still one yet I will
probably do an update on this one now
what I will say is this these are very
these are much easier to apply then
these are and reason being is because
these are because of the material this
is Mae about the company GM which I
believe you can see the logo on the back
it is or maybe not but yeah let's see
they make tape like the thick tank that
you use to like pack boxes oh no but
usually in with Ag
and our 3m scuze me Jim of the car
company and inside but basically is
really good material I cannot lie
because after it meets snatching his off
only thing that this did was roll up it
didn't like kid jacked up or anything
like that so that's the good thing about
it the only thing I didn't like was the
fact that he left residue on the side of
my phone and took me a while to get it
off it didn't damage the phone at all it
protected my phone very much so and the
glowing dark aspect of it is great I
just don't like the fact that yeah hey I
don't know what that was okay so like I
said the colorful ones 1199 the brush
steel is twenty dollars and the
glow-in-the-dark ones that left me
residue or twenty-four dollars so these
are break for Christmas gifts and things
of that nature so if you guys have any
questions let me know and I want to tell
you guys it comes with one of these
cloths that says slick wraps on it if
you can't tear is this upside down yeah
and this basically is a clean as you can
see the front of your phone these are
good I have a whole bunch of them now
but yeah so I hope this helped i hope
that you guys will check out this
product and if you do get the
glow-in-the-dark ones please let me know
if it was just me that had that
particular issue I don't know no one
else has said that they have this issue
but yeah and one more thing these are
air pocket free so they don't leave the
little air bubbles when you put them on
which is a good thing so yeah all right
you guys leave a comment below and let
me know what you think</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
