to the shirt and ask me questions for
this QA someone a scroll is a lot like
it's oh wow we ain't gonna be able to
answer all of those it's a whole lot so
I'm just gonna randomly pick if you
could have three people do a
collaboration on YouTube living or dead
who would it be and why three people I
probably will work with he flawless um
Jackie ina and probably who else Level
II like here for the tea oh my god I've
alerted collab with her girl I just
would like to sit in on her process okay
question who isn't who inspires you to
be so freaking awesome
Barbie inspires me him to my pink hair
or what it worked to be awesome
her life is plastic and fantastic and I
aim to be as awesome okay no that's a
role model girl it's the best most
economical hair where's it from around
16 and 20 inches no I don't know I don't
know okay which are the album from this
year you like jenay's trip was my
is still my but Jenny's trip was a
trip and I'm still on that trip that's
my if you ain't heard that listen to it
it's popping okay what is something you
think of that makes you keep doing what
you're doing what is something that
encouraged you to keep doing something
that you love and not stop oh because I
have dreams and I like hope and
aspiration and all those things and I
still like have completed some of my
goals in life but I still have a lot of
goals to go so I don't want to stop
until everything on my checklist
it's met and I have to make a new
checklist so my first checklist is
halfway dot it out but I still have a
lot more work to go so I never want to
stop doing what I'm doing until I kind
of reach for I feel comfortable or while
I'm still challenging myself to do more
if that makes any sense somebody said
what do you do I do this
yeah YouTube's my life that's the power
like word is when I first started doing
this I had a regular job and I don't
anymore this is my job so are you coming
to the East Coast okay so I was supposed
to come to the East Coast this year but
it was with a company and then the
company had me the so that didn't
go through so I came to the East Coast
for some work stuff back in May I think
yeah May it wasn't her so I had to be me
but I didn't stay every time I come to
freaking East Coast is always for
something I can never just come on a
vacation type of tip but next year I
think that's what I want to do like come
just like and have a meet and greet
cuz I've been saying that for like ten
years yeah I should have said keep them
short y'all y'all be writing like novels
I came okay the video can only be so
long what's your real name my real name
is definitely Barbie you know I I was
born with that name I'm very excited
about that name I mother knew exactly
what was going on so Barbie for sure
so somebody's question is do you ever
wear your real hair I do but I don't do
it often my hair is the anchor I don't
know how many times I got to tell you it
is my hair is usually in braids y'all
y'all have many wigs out where to test
out on a regular I just don't got time
to be walking around with my real hair
if I'm trying to do work you know
unfortunately I don't have the luxury
but yeah I don't I don't know what y'all
obsession is with my real hair I don't
get it
I really don't I'm happy your nappy just
like y'all you ever considered doing
RuPaul's drivers because um there will
be no competition gorgeous thank you and
I have thought about it but I cannot so
to save my life
so yeah I'm not gonna be one of the
bitches get ya
I made using the show and you cuz I talk
 about the ones who get on there and
act like they never seen him before and
if you haven't but you shouldn't sign up
stupid keeps playing and thank you baby
do you have a twin or siblings I do have
siblings but I don't have a twin when I
came out it was all about me baby how
are you liking the New Beetle and would
you ever come I mean would you ever move
outside of California I love my new car
like nobody's business when I move out
of California probably but I don't know
where but not no time soon like one
thing you like in my forties so I like
the next ten years or so nine years or
so I might do it depending on what it is
like if I get a job or something that
you know requires me to leave I was
going to fall out then I'll do it
there's no problem but it has to be the
right reason because this is home and
luckily I was born and raised and like
the best place ever how you're
considered doing it reviews recaps for
TV shows events etc absolutely not I
don't want to do that anymore you guys
you asking me the same question which is
why don't you do loving hip out cuz I
don't feel like it that's a lot of work
and you guys know when I did those
reviews I didn't want to give y'all no
half-ass reviews or not give y'all the
full production if I can't give it to
you in the capacity I would like then no
maybe I'll try to go to like BuzzFeed or
something like that and do it from there
so they can handle the production aspect
and all I got to do is just shoot my
stuff and go so if y'all interested in
that go to BuzzFeed and tell them y'all
would like me to do recaps on shows
instead of some other people who are
really boring just laying in that was a
full-blown hurricane question do you
have a boyfriend / girlfriend are you
talking to someone or the doggies how
have you grown mentally peers so the
first question is do I have a boyfriend
such girlfriend absolutely not I have a
boo thing that I love the second
question is am i talking to somebody
that was mm-hmm
my dogs are great they are on my nerves
every day but I wouldn't have it any
other way they're amazing and how I
brought mentally droney years of you
know I'm assuming being on YouTube
a lot I still got a lot of growing to do
but I've learned to get tougher skin
because there's always gonna have be
someone who has something very negative
to say about you you could be the ripe
as the peach in the bunch but somebody
still hang on like peaches
yeah Malloy just how the world is and
then there's a lot of unhappy people who
you know they like to talk negative
about you and things that you do and a
lot of times I find people who have
negative things to say about you or Mac
because they're not doing what you're
doing or living in their truth and they
kind of feel away about it so they will
rather talk about you then support you
which is that's that's the way the world
spin um but I've learned to get a
tougher skin you guys see me pop off
every so often and I think the
assumption is every time I pop off is
the first time and it's probably not I
probably have ignored like 18 things
that day and then I just kind of got
tired of it and went off or the 118
thing that week you know so the bigger
you're following gets the more criticism
that you're gonna have to deal with with
people and sometimes you get a little
tired of just being the good guy and
being the person who just takes it on
the chin is sometimes it's not that so
I'm grow mentally to be a better me but
I also have still have some growing to
do but I think there are ways about me
that I think they're never gonna change
I'm just kind of am who I'm an Aries
okay let's just call that what it is my
question is how do you do with like
negativity and fill in sit wait till
then I think sad since you're pretty
optimistic for the most part um you know
like I just said in the last question
it's a mental thing like you have to
realize that this person probably lives
somewhere where their electricity bill
that probably doesn't go over $20 they
probably work you know at a gas station
which I ain't never at the gas station
but you gottem sound like they they're
looking at your life not necessarily
what they're saying about you is what
they feel is that they're kind of mad or
envious or upset because you live in the
big city and you're living your dreams
in your living out loud and they're
still living wherever they're living or
they could live right next door to you
and are just mad because your hair is
pink or your car is gold or you know I'm
saying you have
are you you're friends with this person
it could just be a plethora of things so
I've learned to just let people talk you
know as long as you spell my name right
I'm fine so I didn't just get here by
supportive people leave there sometimes
the haters buy the most expensive ticket
will you ever do a meet and greet in LA
or anywhere else I will do a meet and
greet but I do I don't want to do it
just randomly like I don't think y'all
really understand it takes a lot for me
and great because you got to get
together you got to find it being you
have to make sure people are gonna calm
you know it's like a lot it's not unless
I just do a random one at a mall and I'm
not trying to get kicked out in our
favorite malls because there's too many
people cuz that has happened to me
before where I've been in Santa Monica
and it kicked me out of fruit it was not
there no more hot topics in y'all no hot
topics just small and it was like two
people then it turns in ten people
didn't turn into 15 people and then
before I knew it there was like a line
of people trying to take pictures and
they were like y'all gonna have to get
out because we don't have enough space
up in here for all y'all muhfuckas up in
here trying so I don't want that to be
the situation I'm winning I like
organization so it makes sense
you get what I'm saying this president
always also asked me the very next day
where is the Q&amp;amp;A y'all got a lot how
patience works okay if I say I'm gonna
do something I promise you I'm gonna do
it just let me do it on my time cuz
rushing me ain't gonna do nothing
because I let it sit for whole damn week
if you have ever dealt with how do you
do with when people make slick slash
intentional comments on how skinny you
are whether it's friends or random
people like does it look he bother you
or irritate you it doesn't it irritates
me but it doesn't you ever take me for
the obvious reason it irritates me
because we've come into this just
spectrum of big is beautiful which I
totally agree with I don't I don't think
body shaming anybody who's bigger I
think Gabourey Sidibe is amazing I think
that Heidi Klum's amazing Tyra I just I
like people of all different sacher's
but I think because we've gotten to the
acceptance that bigger people are
curvier people are people too
than people who would like or myself we
get ridiculed now for being as skinny as
we always been because people assume
that well if you're that thin there
has to be something wrong with you and
that's not true because I've been skinny
literally all of my life so it's
a little irritating when someone
especially when the person is bigger
because I feel like there's some
deep-rooted anger there that they're
saying what they're saying it's kind of
like you live on Skinny Bitch and I've
dealt with that before and then like I
it happened to me on Halloween cuz I
dressed up as Hollywood I mean yeah
Hollywood here Barbie and this girl was
like what's wrong with you are you so
skinny
do you eat and I was like yes bitch I'll
 eat okay I can eat you out of
house and home if I really wanted to
when I don't throw it up bitch but if I
didn't eat I wouldn't want nothing from
your ass bitch because I
know you keep your kitchen nasty so no
I'm good but yeah just just understand
being big is beautiful being small is
beautiful if it's how you naturally are
then why go against that but you have
people who have insecurities you know so
they want to kind of get you where other
people have got them so somebody who
probably was teased about being bigger
probably has an issue with me just
because I'm small and they take it out
on me so whatever girl
are you coming to New York or Kali Ann
sir that already but yeah I plan to come
to New York next year for sure for like
a medium grade and like a meet-up and
the whole thing the next question is I
love all your RPG show looks and I also
really love when you did the RPG show
blue hair the smoke blue hair but I've
yet to see you work with them again is
there beef there because I asked them
about you and they said you you don't
want to work with them anymore that is
true I don't with them anymore so
yeah you won't be seeing a more RBG show
up here so sorry not sorry
what's your biggest pet peeve when it
comes to music auto-tune hey Malibu do
you plan to do any TV show reviews you
know I'm I'm good job like it's a lot of
people who do this but I'm good I don't
I don't enjoy that so sorry guys do how
