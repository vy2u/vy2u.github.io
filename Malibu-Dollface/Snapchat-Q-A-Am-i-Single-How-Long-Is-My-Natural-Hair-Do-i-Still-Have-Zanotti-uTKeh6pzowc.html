was going to do a QA and these are some
of the questions that stood out to me I
haven't read all these so yeah we're
kind of we're gonna do this together
people I said the first question is do I
have a boyfriend um
do I have a boyfriend I don't that
anymore so somebody that I actually
talked to which is hope disguised if you
guys are interested anything LGBT
related or anything of anything to do
with trans issues she's the perfect
person and she asked me how do you deal
with what people's opinion of you um
some of us have the toughest skin but
sometimes it's very hard for me
personally you guys know I've kind of
went at everybody uh-huh but what I have
learned is that you can't go at the
world you can't you know get at
everybody but sometimes people do need
to be made an example of because people
don't know what goes on in your personal
life and they think because you have a
platform that you're not able to duck
when people throw tomatoes at you and
sometimes you will pick up a tomato and
throw that back so sometimes people
how you have to make an example of
certain people you can't go at everybody
and me personally I got a little
flustered about what's going on my life
well I'm just kind of over worked myself
and I just need a bit of a break I have
the breeze bikes here in California
where you can for a monthly charge you
can get the bikes in Santa Monica
Beverly Hills Venice and you can ride
them as long as you would like um for a
flat fee for I think ninety minutes and
they may start charging you after that
but I have a membership for yearly so
mines is like free 90-day rights but it
definitely helps me clear my head I like
to go to very nice areas and go walking
with the dogs it definitely helps me
clear my mind cuz sometimes you have to
get off the internet if they if the
internet is what you do all day
eventually it will start to consume you
and you start to go kind of crazy um
another one is I seen that you posted
about screen Queen season 2 I know that
your character died in your short but
will you be back for another short this
Halloween now a lot of you guys have
asked me about this a lot of you guys
asked who was the killer a lot of you
guys asked me what I'll be back will I
be back
I don't snow but um I will say this if
is something that I see because I only
know a bit of the premise of what's
going on for season two which is they're
going to be in the hospital so I don't
exactly know um where it's going to go
and how these characters from last
season fit in but if I see or feel as if
my character that was there or new
character I don't know fits in somehow
then I definitely will try to get you
guys something that you guys would like
for Halloween since you guys enjoyed the
last one so we shall see I don't know so
the question says how do you get your
makeup so flawless
they put do flawless but I know what you
meant baby um yeah it's definitely been
a trial and error you can watch a lot of
my videos and see those errors um but
what I will say is um just try what
works on you sometimes everything that I
do that doesn't work I don't always post
and then I figure out what works best
for me as you can see my makeup has come
very far since when I first started with
the good ol eyeliner so practice
definitely does make perfect
same thing with hair the more you
practice on things the more we as
youtubers practice on our frontals and
stuff like that it definitely does make
it better so if you feel like you look
like a clown try to look less like a
clown as you do it and then eventually
you'll learn how to pull back and put
things okay so I just got like three
questions in one you were smart um he
asked me where do I see myself in two
years am I still going to be doing hair
reviews or am I still gonna be on
YouTube like what I'm within two years I
do plan on doing a lot of other stuff I
do want to definitely keep you guys
because this is where I started I don't
want to necessarily stop YouTube maybe I
won't be doing reviews um make your nose
thing was a new room but um I do still
see myself doing a lot of more vlogging
as if within the last like month I find
vlogging to be very therapeutic that's
why you guys have been in a lot more
videos from me than you normally would
give because I'm starting to kind of get
in the swing of okay let's share a
little bit you know um but I do plan on
still doing YouTube I don't know if I'll
be doing what I'm doing now but
something that you guys will be involved
in I will do the next question is
when will I do another skincare routine
um which I actually just did so that's a
bad day and so that question and then
the last question is what um editing
software do I use for my videos I use
iMovie because I report on an iPad I
have the iPad Mini for um so with this
one it comes already it was free an app
store and it's already attached so I
don't have to transfer all of this
footage to my computer then edited it's
easier for me just do it on my iPad
transfer it to my computer and then
upload it just it's much easier okay so
somebody asked me when I say that I
Drive my curly hair upside down exactly
what does that mean okay so it means
that you take your wig and you put your
wig upside down so so here's one of my
wigs so if I take this wig and when this
dry it did not it would not have dry
like this if I let it dry on a wig head
like this so I put it upside down boom
like this and it's going to sit on the
counter like this then all of the curls
will not pull like this when they dry so
you don't end up with these droopy curls
they look like this once they dry so the
next question is why do we see Richie
much more than we see just the Maddie
are you hiding her or what no I feel
like people things in ideas like Saint
West it's just because like you never
see her anymore but she's frantic like
she will not sit sit still if you guys
follow me on snapchat do you guys know
it's very hard for me to get photos with
her it's very hard for me to do anything
where she's sitting down
if she's not sleep and if she's not
sleep she's usually nowhere near me um
so that's why you really don't see her
as much she just doesn't know how to sit
down Ritchie on the other hand is very
he's black sticks it if I want to kick
it and cuddle he'll cuddle with me she
will do that for so long as soon as I
pull out a camera ghost so that's why
you don't see her as much but she's fine
she's crazy the bitch is crazy but she
will always have a special place in my
heart because she was my first dog ever
so yeah but she they love each other and
I will do a dog vlog for you guys so you
guys can see exactly what I mean
so someone asks me what
I started a clothing brand and I've been
contacted by numerous companies to
collaborate with them kind of how like
H&amp;amp;M does it with like bomb on or they'll
do it with Versace or stuff like that
and I just haven't found the correct
situation for me to be in that I feel
like I could give my all to and it
represent exactly what I would like um
Makino probably would be the closest as
far as what represents me we'll see how
it goes um but yeah I thought about it
trust me I thought about a bit if you
guys know anything about me I just don't
like to slap my name on anything and
just put it out to make money that's why
I don't have a hair company of any sort
and I because that's a lot and I want my
company to be something that I can stand
behind and I want my hand in every point
of it and if I can't I don't want to
just say this is my hair and then my
hair sucks
it just I've done too much in the hair
industry period and on the internet
period to just do something like that so
that's why I've been very um I've spent
smart about what to and what not to put
my name on who to and who not to work
with because a lot of times people would
just see the following that you have and
just want to throw something at somebody
and it's no different than what they
already sell but it's ten times the
price and I'm not going to do that so
will I do clothing probably when I don't
know it's only God knows people so this
girl event she just hit me up and said
it was her birthday it was on a fifth
sign so I'm gonna wish her happy
birthday you know cuz I'm so I'm so
sorry
okay the next question is will you do
another shoe haul because the last one
that you did I really enjoy um yes I
will do another shoe ha
I had a big I'm gonna have problems last
year all but a lot of people were kind
of like these shoes are a little more
expensive than I will have life and a
lot of I'm just gonna just say it
my tasting shoes in my shoe closet has
got a little an expensive side so I do
have shoes that I will review in-between
so like a mid-range haul and then I'll
do just another expensive one but yeah
my tasting shoes and just things that I
buy is a little bit more expense
then I was doing so I don't do them as
often as I used to
okay nice guys where do I see myself in
ten years um I definitely see myself on
TV I love to act and um I don't want to
just put all of my charismatic business
Oh to waste so I definitely want to do
something TV wise a series such as
Malaysia or anything that gives me a
chance to be creative I want to do that
I also see myself living in either
Beverly Hills um it sounds cliche but if
you're familiar you know what I mean um
the Palisades or Santa Monica or
Brentwood any of those um and I do see
myself at in ten years married okay I do
want to get married I know a lot of you
guys are asking like I do want to get
married I do want to have children I do
want to give my kids the gift of Sanada
and Richie so they can take care of them
um yeah but I just see myself I'm being
um the spouse of someone and in having
any creating I never liked for that
person to be some somebody who was
creative like myself so we can bounce
ideas off each other and you know we'll
enjoy you did it on this one what is my
will or Jay - mm-hmm when are you coming
to the East Coast a lot of you guys
always ask me this and the thing is I
will be in New York very soon I will be
on the East Coast very soon I am working
with someone else about something so
that's why I've been to these coasts
quite a few times I have never put it on
Instagram I never did it because always
I kind of like work-related so I don't
want to be like hey I'm gonna do a
meeting right here but I don't need
y'all anything on here you know I don't
want to do that so very soon um probably
during like the holiday season possibly
if not the top of the year but I
definitely will be more on the East
Coast so I'll say that it says do you
have anybody any other advice other than
do you for people who are trying to love
themselves and just have a hard time
with them with their self-confidence um
what I will say is a lot of times when
you're trying to figure out exactly who
you are the issue is your are your life
mean other people's opinion to kind of
stifle your personal creativity and who
you become and you guys know on this
channel I will go from renting in a car
with it inside our t-shirt on and a
beanie and then I'll go to this because
I just don't let nobody put me in a box
to say that what I can and I cannot do
so if you feel like wearing a clown nose
and some heels and a tutu one day then
do it because what it's going to allow
you to do is live in your truth which is
be who you are if you allow other
people's opinion to pretty much say what
you shouldn't you shouldn't do then
that's all you're gonna ever hear in
life every time you decide to do
something is those people telling you
what you shouldn't do so allow yourself
to fail and fly in your own mind and do
it in your own lane so that when other
people have something to say about it
you know how to defend it if somebody
calls me out of my name or referenced me
to something that I'm not I have a
comeback to explain why they're wrong
but if I really am not comfortable in
myself and somebody says something to me
of that magnitude then what's going to
happen is I'm kind of gonna clam up
because probably what I feel what
they're saying is true so yeah it still
do you but make sure you do you and you
can stand behind yourself be proud of
you whatever your quirks are your
kookiness is be proud of that because if
you can't be proud of it what's going to
end up happiness people are going to
find a way to tear it down then it's
going to be a problem okay so the last
question is will you ever do a natural
hair check okay so this has been a
question that I've gotten crazy amounts
of like everywhere when are we going to
see your hair I posted this picture on
Instagram um well I posted both of these
on Instagram they were proud like a year
apart I just did this one where I'm
holding my hair recently because I got
my hair braided and that was my hair
after I cut it like from a bob it was
like a I had I just had my homegirl cut
it into like a bob because you guys know
wear wigs all the time I the braids that
I had once before my hair cannot be that
long and hold of beehive for more than
two weeks because then it's just going
to grow out so I've been
pretty much rocking my natural hair in
braids that's why I always have been you
when I see you guys when I'm not made up
because I got a whole Leeroy situation
up under here um so I will do a video on
my limp check even the largest cut my
hair once I go ahead and Flatiron it and
press it out again but for the most time
for the most part you guys I'm not
really one to using one soon as I come
out of braids I go right back in them so
it's hard for me to say okay well let me
stop because once I don't have any
braids I can't do any reviews and I'm
just kind of in-between so I won't kind
of carve out some time to kind of
explain what's going on with my hair but
it's growing out it keeps growing
I just keep cutting it's been growing I
did take care of Finity for a little bit
but I started breaking out from me
because I wasn't drinking enough water
and then I was using some boys I forgot
what the name simplicity oil I use that
they send me some I was using it along
with the Hairfinity and it definitely
hurt my hair grown but there were some
kind of hang-ups that came with the
Hairfinity but not the oil so I kind of
stopped both but I'll go back into that
later but I hope you guys enjoyed this I
hope I answered a lot of you guys
questions that you guys were wondering
about and I'll do this much sooner
quicker I just wanted to do something
just that wasn't hair related or
whatever so you guys could feel like we
were having a conversation so all the
review for this hair is definitely up I
will put the link to that below and I
will catch y'all in my next one peace
