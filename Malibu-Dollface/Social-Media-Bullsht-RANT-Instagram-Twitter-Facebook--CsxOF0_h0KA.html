about social media - and when I say
social media I mean like Instagram
Tumblr and all this other that is
now out that is so unnecessary but you
know if it was on it so we're going to
just dive right in okay because I just
want to like hit a couple of key points
because I'm just kind of over it um why
is it that seem everybody wants to know
what celebrity everybody wants to be a
celebrity's flunky what it what is that
about when did we stop reaching for the
stars bull's eye wouldn't set about you
know I'm saying everybody wants to be in
the insistent and wants to be around
celebrities but don't want to do
anything you know worthwhile to be their
own celebrity we've talked about this
before so I'm not going to die delve too
far into the but pretty much is
what I'm saying
um the thing that I don't understand
anything that I do not like it's a
simple fact that
why is everybody got to flaunt their
relationship on social media can we
please talk about this like I just don't
understand it's one thing when y'all are
cute or you you know I've been there you
lay in a bed and you guys want to say so
let's take a selfie let's take pictures
and then you do it but why is it every
five minutes it's a picture of you and
this person you're just trying to prove
and it's one thing like I know people
personally who have relationships where
they they just post pictures on their
Instagram and stuff like that and it's
nothing wrong with that but then you've
got other people who are looking at that
something that's naturally done and
they're like oh no we gotta do that we
gotta one up this bitch
we gotta you know I'm saying we have to
show our love when it's really lust
y'all just ready to fill a void
for a particular moment because you want
to feel like the rest of the damn world
bitch don't nobody give a you not
Beyonce and jay-z and even the
 try to goddamn hard to be
a weird imperfect couple were we're
y'all know bitch nobody cares like it's
not that deep like y'all put up like two
couple of pictures now started think
that Beyonce like a you jury come over
here and pick me up so they could I did
Julius make sure you give me from this
are and then make sure that I look real
happy okay and they make sure RVs down
there looking so they can think that we
perfect meanwhile jay-z probably got
knocked on our mouths so
who knows I'm not saying that's what
you're doing but you never know the way
that my father try to act today they try
to put on the front like their
relationships are so perfect like come
on they're your little fake relationship
it's isn't it I don't understand I'm
almost convinced now that people get
with people because of the simple fact
that they don't want to be by themselves
they don't want to look lonely so you
have a moment boyfriend instead of
having a true love you know there is a
difference so that's the thing that I
don't necessarily understand nor I get
or do I agree with I think it's a lot of
it is just a lot of and a lot
of attention seeking like your mama
didn't hug you enough when you as a kid
so you feel the need to get on social
media and do things and act out in order
to get attention like bitches who'll be
out here twerking that's my next topic
why is everybody's a child grandchild a
grandson out here and some little ass
shorts shaking their ass like y'all
ain't got no home training you might not
have no home training yes doesn't it
listen if that's the way that you were
brought up and you think that's the way
that you get attention I'm sorry to tell
you but that it's not no man is going to
ever respect the girl who sits on social
media or the internet for that matter
and twerks her ass clean out no dude
either I only do that are gonna want
y'all for that hood dude who going to
see you for just that if the dude is
looking at you and he wants to talk to
you based off your twerking abilities
that means he wants one thing bitch and
it's not to talk and you're giving them
pretty much the gateway to see what
they're going to get once they get the
entire cow you would not be wifey you
will not be husband you will not you
know you will not get in those positions
because let me just tell you and be
frank with you nobody wants to be with
somebody where other people can Google
that person and see anything that is
supposed to be private public that's
just the truth
I don't want it I'm sure the next person
don't want it so it might be a thirsty
dude out here who's watching you tell
them that you everything you should
continue to keep doing this because his
nasty-ass want to watch you do this and
do god knows what in the privacy of his
own home then you got
who'll be in a relationship Tuesday and
then they be team single on Wednesday
bitch you move kind of quick yo but it's
really the truth though it is what it is
however you display yourself to the
public that's what you're gonna remember
this is something that I always remember
and something somebody told me this a
long time ago
remember how you introduce yourself
because that's exactly how people work
always remember you every single time
they look at you you do wonder Kim
Kardashian will always be the girl who
had the sex tape
Paris Hilton will always be the girl the
socialite who had a sex tape later they
can do they can save the world we can
not be starving no more it could be they
would still be known for that so
remember how you introduce yourself
because that's exactly how people
remember you and unfortunately that is
the world we have one-track minds we
don't know how to forget that
happened eons ago but if you continue to
do this see that the Internet does not
erase anything only thing that it does
is it stores and it remembers that's all
it does why would you as a person who
has talent who can do something want to
lower yourself and starts to do
that other people are doing it's sad and
a lot of y'all are too
grown to be doing it in the first place
the next thing that I don't understand
and I don't get is that
everybody's supposed to be so
unbothered
everybody is unbothered about this
everybody's involved in about that
unbothered it would be the person that
you're talking about that you don't care
about like that's the person is
unbothered because they sitting back
watching all this stuff knowing it's
subliminal you know I'm saying but but
if you saw unbothered
why are you like oh this bitch over here
think he or she's doing this because she
got to sit on the other I don't know
anything about a person that I don't
particularly care for if I don't like
you and I'm not friends with you then
therefore I don't know anything that
goes on in your life
I personally don't give a damn what goes
on in your life it is what the hell it
is but then you have out
here who I mean I know people who are
more mad at me about that happened
in oh nine she that happened before that
after that you know they try to be
friends with you they try to be part of
your life and you no longer want them
there whether it was for a moment it was
on Twitter it was on Instagram it was on
Facebook it don't matter
the fact that you are there are no
longer part of your circle and part of
anything that you do and you they no
longer get replies from you and they're
blocked they have issues with that get
the over it bitch don't nobody
 care about your raggedy ass
more your wack everything that you do is
whack your clothes are whack your hair
is whack your personality is whack and
your ass is probably whack so therefore
your whack ass can say over there I'm
sick of people who always have an issue
with other people trying to move forward
and be good and they're holding on to
old stupid that have been so
 long ago this you get over it
you're gonna around and get an
ulcer with your bitter old
ass people I don't understand it get the
 over it it is it's petty to be mad
at something that happened on the
Internet first off is mad
at me because I said years ago and
they're mad about it bitch you get the
 over it I don't even know what the
 I said I've done hundreds of videos
I don't know who the I'm pissed off
in the midst of that fool gives the
I don't know I bet I don't care it is
what the it is but these are the
same month others who are screaming
their unbothered bitch you're not
unbothered you're very much bothered
you're better you bothered by the fact
that my hair does this you're mad at the
fact that my lips do this you're mad at
the fact that I can sit here and gain
all these views from people who give a
 about me and what I have to say
meanwhile you struggling 400 that's your
issue you should be violet bitch because
you're struggling you use you ugly you
ain't got no job you ain't got no money
you ain't got no following you ain't got
 to show for bitch pillow struggle
cuz you own me just damn like but these
were what people do this is the thing
that people do and I don't
understand and they let little social
media get to the point where
they're mad upset and their feelings
about to happen so I get the
over a bitch cuz I'm damn sho over it I
don't care no more it is what the
it is like I'm good my bank account look
real sick and you could
never ever in life make me feel any
kinda way about myself as long as that
 is good I'm good so when it comes
down to social media y'all just stop
doing the extras stop
doing all the extras that you don't need
to do in order to get attention it's
it's disgusting for come on now like
it's 2014 we need to be known for a
little bit more than shaking our asses
I'm just saying girls and guys are like
it's just good and really sad it is
sad it makes no sense if you want to
rant about something do it exactly what
I do in the rest of YouTube do we pick
up a camera with clothes
on we say how we feel we don't twerk we
don't shake our asses we don't do
anything that we cannot show our mothers
that is what y'all do not understand a
lot of you get mad at the
simple fact that people say these things
the same thing that I'm saying about you
other people say and then you get in
your feelings well you mad because you
can't do it bitch I probably can do it
10 times better than you but I do it for
the person that I'm with in the privacy
of my own home I don't do it for the
whole world and think
somebody gonna respect you for that
no one's ever going to respect you for
being a loose bitch ever
that's not respectable and if somebody
is respect you for that
they don't want from you but that
remember that how you get them is how
you keep them trust and believe that one
because no dude wants to be with no
chick who's been shaking her ass showing
all this doing god-knows-what on this
side the other and his friends can go
google it do you know how emasculating
that is to a man to even have to think
about his girlfriend the chick that he's
with doing any of this and the same girl
with us gays do you think that a dude
who really wants to settle down with you
wants to be with somebody who does
nothing but perpetuate the gay
stereotype that we are nothing but
promiscuous and loose do you really
think somebody wants that for a long
term I mean like let's just keep it real
I mean it is what it is
you make the decisions but y'all got to
stop all this attention-seeking because
your mama didn't hug you when you was
little when cuz your daddy didn't tell
you that he loved you when you were
smaller you know I'm saying y'all got to
stop all that all these excuses
it's the why y'all acting batshit
 crazy out here like y'all ain't
got a home training if you didn't have
no home training then bitch you
definitely know the difference between
wrong and right and you need to start
applying that to your everyday
 life because it makes
absolutely no sense or who
are in a 30s and a 40s and what's up the
last thing I'm talking about is you
bitter I'm sick of you D
just nasty ass but you ever met some
other who who's known they get a
jolly off the fact that they're bitter
everything that comes out their mouth is
negative there's nothing positive
you'll be like oh the sky is blue today
with a cloud over there and it's gone
 rain you just a the cup is
always half-empty type bitch that's what
they do and they get known for it and
they're known for being a nasty bitter
bitch but when an actuality is because
they don't like themselves they don't
like who the they are they don't
like the position that they in instead
of trying to change that and make a
better them they sit back and they
wallow in it and look for the sit back
and really have the gall to laugh at
this there are moments where I get
in my feelings and I say what the I
got to say but for 90% of the time I'm
actually a pretty
happy-go-lucky type of bitch I don't sit
back and try to push negativity upon
people or every time somebody ring will
example let's hop in from destiny shout
who is she she ain't had a head and this
is that any other bitch but you've never
had a you will never have
here cuz you can't thing you ain't got
no talent the only thing that you can do
and sit back and do is be bitter it's
been mad about something that has
absolutely positively nothing to do with
you you know I'm saying like that's the
 that I don't understand I don't get
I don't like I don't respect and I'm not
going to respect you know that's one of
the reasons why I don't talk about
celebrities because I don't really have
pretty no nice things to say about most
of them so I don't so there are people
who purposely like their thing is I
throw shade all day okay so you want to
be known for being a a bitter bitch a
mad bitch a bitch no one likes you're
only good for throwing shade you know
saying that's why never nothing ever
good happens to these people and this is
one of the reasons why I personally just
be so very honest with y'all and real
friend I don't talk about celebrities
and the reason is because I don't ever
want nobody to say the reason why people
like you are the reason why people watch
you is because you sit back and talk
about celebrities all day long
because it's entertainment if Hollywood
took a break for a day how many
 would have nothing to talk
about they would have nothing
interesting to say their shade would
make no sense because there's nothing
else there there is no depth that's what
you are face value a bitter mad bitch
who's wants to ride Beyonce's coattails
or you want to ride um Britney Spears
coattails or you want to say with
Christina
hasn't done or you want to say what this
next person is or you which your family
is that type of situation so yeah mind
your business do you be a better view of
2014 you shouldn't be worried about what
the hell I'm doing or anybody else you
should be worrying about your damn self
and on that note</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
