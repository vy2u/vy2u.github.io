review and I got two bumps right here
just let it go just let it go but this
video is gonna be about body shame cuz I
see this a lot online and I get it a lot
you know it's rude but I want to
talk about this because I feel like
there is a definitely a double standard
in a lot of areas where I feel is just
disrespectful in this route overall
though so you know people me I'm five
foot four for those who want to know who
I've been asking I am 5 foot 4 I weigh a
hundred and five pounds okay so I am
short and I am skinny I've always been
there my mom is short and my daddy is
really skinny so um I got the best of
both worlds I guess you could say I
don't know um but with that being said
um a lot of times if I post a picture of
myself like let's just say this picture
of myself out or this one people be like
it's always one bitch you're so skinny
you should eat something you should do
this and you should do that and I'll be
thinking to myself I probably eat more
than an average teenage boy honestly I
like to eat I love to eat I have a very
high metabolism have always been like
that
um when I was in junior high school well
when I was just younger in general um I
had asthma really really bad so they
used to give me my inhalers and when you
have really chronic asthma some of the
asn't medicine has steroids in it high
asthma since birth so all the way up in
to I was about 15 or 16 I used to stay
in a hospital so I would take this
medicine on a regular basis which it
made me chubby so when I was in June
high school I was in fact but I was a
little chubbier um once I got into high
school I didn't have to take the
medicine as much if at all
so the summer between 8th grade and
going into 9th grade I lost probably
about a good 20 pounds probably 15 or 20
pounds from what I was so impressed I
was shorter than what I am now so did I
didn't go to the same
school as the gym high school that I
went to that's another story so I had
just got really thin and lean and you
know that's and I went to the doctor
about it and the doctor was like this is
how this is the sizes you're supposed to
be like you were too heavy before like
on your frame because you are a small
person that was too much weight but you
know it's something that you can do
either you don't take the medicine and
die
you know or you just gain a little bit
of weight so I had really didn't notice
much of a change in my body until my
clothes started fitting a little bit
different and then people that I did go
to school with and during high school
started to see a difference but it was
cool with me I didn't mind it but I've
always been small even as a kid I
remember being in like elementary school
and everybody thought you know when I
was in first second grade I was supposed
to be with the little kitty girl I was
just so little I was born small that's
this just always been my life I got a
big mouth but you know I've always been
a small individual so when I get on
social media and I see people write very
hateful comments either to me or people
like ariana grande who's just she's very
small in stature you should eat
something
see and the thing that I don't like
about this and where I find it to be a
double standard is if we called you a
triple neck fat ass bitch who needs to
stop eating them then we're wrong for
saying that jhené aiko we went to the
same dream high school and she's way
shorter than me and she's way smaller
than me too well she didn't have a child
and people still write in her comments
oh you're so little you're so thin you
need to eat something you need to do
this you guys I find it to be very very
rude and I posted that and some people
were finding that I posted there but
well your you should be happy that your
only worry is the fact that you're too
thin you can always eat something taking
weight off is the issue and I'm thinking
to myself so pretty much I should be
grateful that I'm not fat but take the
 that you're giving me because
you feel insecure about being fat
because at the end of the day I'm not
gonna sit up here and argue with nobody
about my body I don't give a about
what you eat how many double
cheeseburgers you eat how much kale you
eat and you're still not losing any
weight I just think that it's just very
rude
to try to body shame somebody because
they're because the way that they look
is not to your liking there's a lot of
things that I can say about people's
appearances and the things that they do
on social media that always have a foot
in their mouth saying something about
someone as they get to a particular
point where they feel like oh I don't
like what you said and I'm not
with you no more because what I said was
the truth like you have to understand
and insult those both ways if you talk
about me I can talk about you if you say
something that I don't like I can say
something that you're not gonna like
that's just how life works but people
don't understand that and it's it starts
with respect you have to respect another
 in order to understand
where they're coming from if I don't
respect you I don't get what you're
talking about
and I don't know how the you
feel so if I tell you look this is who I
am and this is what it is you still
should eat then I say you know you
should stop eating because your clavicle
bone is not even visible
bitch you should think about skipping a
few meals then all of a sudden I'm the
meanest bitch on internet then it turns
into you have fans who are bigger and
you're gonna insult some listen what
does everybody want to be my
manager I don't need you to tell me how
I should and I shouldn't speak like do
you get what I'm saying like I don't
understand how people have the GAR to
throw it out there but then they can't
take it that's the thing I understand I
don't talk about nobody I mind my own
 business if I check my comments
and I see a bitch talking I'm gonna
check that bitch if her
stomach is sitting on her lap and that's
where I'm gonna go with it cuz she said
something about me though my weave my
lips my face or something on me as a
person that's what i'ma go with it I
mean I can be petty trust me I can be
very trying not to be I haven't been
asked petty as I could have been in
these last what four months but I'm
working on it but I just don't like when
people want to sit up there and try to
make it seem like oh being skinny is the
worst thing in the world I'm not a
 anorexic I'm not
throwing up I'm minding my own
business on my Instagram that you follow
and you had a problem with the way I
 look I just
 about your mama that picture you
posted you know my MCM rocky my looks
from I'm Supes yellow but I could and
you know what is that gonna do you know
at the end today is not gonna solve or
help anything
so again just mine with the you say
to people watch how you say cuz you
can't irritate and aggravate somebody
especially if they keep hearing the same
thing over and over and over again it's
like somebody telling you you know being
black that's just really not huge you
look when there's nothing else I can do
about that you know I can go bleach my
skin but that's not gonna look you ever
seen Sammy Sosa
we are always yelling somebody bleaching
a skin go look at his head that's true
skin bleaching bitch it ain't pretty
so with that being said just watch how
you come at people then also it was
recently I had posted some picture I
forgot what it wasn't Instagram and I
have when people talk I tend to
like see it after the fact like I don't
never see it when they initially put it
up I already see it after they said it's
been a couple hours or you know half an
hour or whatever so I go and this one
particular dude I said I forgot what
it's there I'll put it right here this
is what it was I'm just like you know
whenever somebody talk I always
want to figure out who what kind of
person are you so you know you gotta
click the page hopefully it's not a cow
or who's talking from a private
page pretty wasn't not talking from
a puck from a private page you're not
the first part so I go to his page and
I'm you know the first couple of Scrolls
I'm like why is he sitting down in all
these damn pictures so then I need to a
picture a full-body picture and he's
like I guess with like a biker team or
something and he's paraplegic like he
can't not walk he got like jelly legs
and I'm like for you to be in such a
very vision you shouldn't be talking
 or having and you ever say like
there's gotta be a code of conduct when
you can't you my dear need not to talk
 cuz I I could have said so many
things that would have been equally as
disrespectful as what he said and I said
you know
I'm gonna take the high road but I'm
still gonna throw a little - a shade up
in there so I wrote and I'm just you can
see it right here but I can't right now
so I think I said you seem to be some
type of handicap so I'm gonna let that
one slide this time we're the world our
life has been cruel enough to you and
it's the truth you go through these
things so I I just took it as he's mad
and sad about the the events in the
cards that he's been dealt in life and
he wants to make other people feel the
same and that's what a lot of these
people who want to body shame you that's
what they do
old you're jus this you're to that but
they're not perfect either they have
things about them that they don't like
and they don't with either that but
they're not gonna tell you they're gonna
keep that in their purse they're gonna
cry about that to their mother they're
not gonna cry to that about you you know
I'm saying so again in closing watch
what the you say and watch how the
 you say and watch who the you
say it to because one day somebody's
gonna fly back and show ass while you're
trying to be funny and hurt so
 feelings just saying I'm
happy to be Who I am the size that I am
and can think about got a problem with
that that's you that's your issue okay
you're the one with the problem not me
I'm good I'm living my life and you over
your judge</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
