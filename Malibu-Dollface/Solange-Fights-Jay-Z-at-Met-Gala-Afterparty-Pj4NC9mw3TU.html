videos today but today was the day that
jay-z and Solange eh um they got into a
fight and let me just start by saying
this is the most entertainment that I
have experienced and in like just in the
blogs and shit in a long-ass time
just let me just say that okay so I
slept really late today as you can see
by my eyes I slept really late cuz I was
a really likes I've been working on some
stuff so you know if it ran a little
lower than what I wanted so I didn't get
up until really late like the afternoon
today so you know all these tweets and
then sir wills calling me and I'm like
yo jay-z and Solange got into it and I'm
just like what the fuck like I'm
thinking they got into like an argument
it was like no it's a video and I'm
thinking like it's a camera phone video
like somebody took from a distance of
her yelling at him or him yelling at her
something but then to see the actual
video of her kicking punching and
spitting on him was like damn like what
happened now let me just give you like a
bit of a backstory or whatever because
from my understanding jay-z and Solange
I've always got along and they've never
had real issues like that and even Jules
her son you know literally looks up to
jay-z and jay-z say you know he has the
potential and the talent to be a very
great lyricist it was funny because just
the other day I was watching Solange's
interviews which I never do but I've
learned somebody else in in it you know
the related videos went into hers so I'm
like you know she seems cool she seems
very humble and herself and even we can
go back as far as 2008 go know 2001 or
2002 I remember what year was but
Destiny's Child performed at the when it
was here in LA it was the Lakers versus
the Sixers and I'm where I was in junior
high at the time and they had before
bootylicious and they got booed and
Solange was in the back like donate
donate if you don't believe me go look
for the footage just just go look where
she was real clear about it so since
then I had knew that salon she was a bit
on the
and beyond the SAT like my sister has
taught me to you know not take no shit
so to see her go in on him like that was
like whoa like something deep had to
happen now rumors are saying that jay-z
hits Beyonce now if I'm not mistaken
about three or four videos ago I stated
that very same fact I said if you
sitting up here one of jay-z and Beyonce
relationship he probably whooping her
ass and we don't even know and then this
happen so that's the rumor that
allegedly that's what the situation is
now we all know Beyonce to be a bit of a
robot you know we know Beyonce it
doesn't really show much emotion when it
comes down to really anything but music
anything outside of music she's very
meek him out and she's always been like
that even her mother says she may even
she was younger the little girls and
wanna play with her because there was
like she's pretty and they didn't like
her but she didn't really say anything
about it because that's just how she is
so um you know the see her stand there
and watch them to go at it in Porto
Julius he was trying so hard to push
that goddamn door but and he just like
just hurry up somebody just hurry up and
she kept going back and forth and then
at a point
Solange ojz I don't know who steps on
Beyonce's dress and then she that's the
only like reaction she's hired through
this whole thing after there's kicking
punching wigs flying and it's flaring
and she just like Donald J my dress damn
my dress that's the only like thing I
got from her and then salon she just
talking shit I can hear was a lot of
motherfuckers and you ain't shitting you
a deadbeat mother fucka and you diss and
you dad I'm gonna fuck you up that's all
I could hear because there's no audio so
I had to put my own subtitles up in
there that's what it sound like I mean
um and then at a point she looks at
jay-z like what he looked at Beyonce
like what so it looks like she she
didn't defend him in this situation
because he was in the wrong or doing
something so it could have been him
talking to another woman disrespecting
Beyonce said something out of line to
Solange because so I'm just always gonna
go to bed first sister that's just it if
you know anything about the Knowles
family then go
that for each other no matter what their
personal views may possibly be now there
was a fake tweet that was and i
retweeted it not thinking it was real
because when people make a fake shit
it tends to look very crusty so whoever
made this on a damn Android phone and
then saved it that small and then blew
it up that big we know so we obviously
seem that it was not real um but I did
root wheaty because it to me it had some
validity to it like it felt like it was
coming from
it made it came from a place that may
have been true I don't know but um yeah
it just is it's not a funny situation
but it is funny cuz she went to fuck in
and of course jay-z could have fucked
her up if he really wanted to but he
didn't so I will give him credit there
but if you watch the backstage DVD from
years past there is a clip of jay-z
sonken a woman in a head so and his I've
heard that he's a little knuckle dug you
know crisp varnish with his girl so I
don't know Beyonce doesn't seem like the
one that would say anything if she was
hit or she was you know disrespected or
whatever the situation is I don't know
but what I will say is um this kind of
puts a lot of things that we wondered
and put into perspective because I don't
believe that Solange was drunk I don't
believe anything I think that something
was said or a situation was brought up
that brewed this out
that's a bitch on Twitter though I not
mind you I'm just stating how I
personally feel about the situation
because I wrote I don't really see
Solange popping off for no apparent
reason because from my understanding and
everything that she said about jay-z
she's always held him to a very high
standard and respect especially having
him around Jules um him Rihanna and
Jules were on the stage at the Grammys
like in 2006 or 7 so I don't really
think that she would lend her child to
meet with somebody that she who
necessarily didn't like you know so and
she you know he's he kicks it with Jules
you know so I don't know what the
situation is I don't know what's gonna
come in after this but she fucked his
ass up
shoutout to Solange cuz she do not play
so fuckin sharkeisha bitch I was Solange
you bitches know that so yeah that's all
I gotta say about the situation I'll put
the link down below to TMZ if you want
to watch
video and yeah it's a sad situation they
said their marriage is on the rocks and
things are not really gonna work out or
whatever and I and then beyond saying
left with her sisters she got in the car
with Solange after this she didn't get
in the car with him so that kind of sent
something to you know I'm saying like
I'm not saying it says everything
because I like him
I don't know what happened I wasn't
there neither were you so everything is
an assumption at this particular point
so nobody can say what really went the
fuck down
we just know from what we seen in that
situation from what we seen it's crazy
now all these pictures just like the
Shabbat pictures of Mimi are all over
the freaking Internet and salons just
walking out to my fucking like I wish a
bitch would like she's she's pumped so
you know it was something deeper than
just a disrespectful word or something
like that you know and I don't really
think that Beyonce would have let that
go on if it wasn't deeper than what it
was but then again Beyonce really don't
do shit anyway you know I'm saying like
she don't seem very confrontational
she's not she just seemed like she cries
with somebody else or something wrong
because I've seen beyond saying you
check by her daddy
oh and one of her documentaries or the
diarrhea Beyonce her mama checked her
about some shorts and then I seen Kelly
say something to her a little out of
line so I think when it's usually not
music related Beyonce really doesn't
know how to really stand up for herself
so jay-z could be hitting her I'm
allegedly allegedly I don't know I
wouldn't want that from nobody cuz I
don't think I batter woman is funny but
and this is the situation that she needs
to get out of it because she has a
daughter and her daughter to see her
daughter her father hit her mother
brother and they're doing it in private
or not children no and I would hate for
Blue Ivy to grow up and know that it was
Ike and Tina going on in her house so
you know I'm saying like I don't know
but they're very private people in now
we know why because this probably
happens on a regular basis so who knows
so shout out to Julie is from being as
strong as he could me and the fact that
Solange ass was wiling the fuck out so I
was talk to you guys later and yeah so
let me know what you guys think what do
you guys think what's going on do you
think it was her fault do you think it
was his fault do you think it was a
coincidence do you think that their
majors in trouble you tell me put it
down below let's have a discussion</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
