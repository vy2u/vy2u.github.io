different
um be channel makeup also so this is
going to be review for my contact lenses
if you didn't notice I'm from I come any
cost
I think it's a little oka and these are
the hydro core and these are ice yeah
these are ice so they're blue okay so
you guys know a last year either was you
know thing with the end of last year I
did a review which you guys can actually
watch it'll be linked below but it was
this review and it was for my decía
contacts and I had got them in forest
green and I really liked the forest
green a whole lot uh those contacts were
actually very affordable I think they
were about sixty bucks and was shipping
and I believe they only they came within
a week they were very comfortable I love
the color the color payoff is a very
natural however those particular
contacts only last three months so
pretty much what they tell you is after
three months you should throw the
contact discard them and buy a new pair
because they're not meant for a
long-term where they're only meant for a
wear of just you know three months um so
those were I came to be pretty much
familiar with that company through
Instagram and I had heard a lot of
hearsay about them and they were like
you know they're very good they look
very natural they're not like those
pixelated a fresh look on text they
actually look really good and they're
made for people with dark eyes now that
was pretty much the mid grade of a brand
of pretty much what you could buy for
great contact lenses that were made from
brown eyes and our darker eyes met
rather and they would actually work and
cover everything the problem was they
look very natural
I just wasn't super in love with any
other color but forest green so I
brought they had like by
to get one free special so I brought I
think some gray ones some blue ones and
I think like a lighter version of green
and I hated all of them
when I did my wig review which was this
one for the Sayed SEO for the it was a
blonde wig I did and I called them as
Kino Barbie I weren't those blue
contacts now in Photoshop I had to go in
and I had to like make them a little
more intense because even though they're
made for dark eyes that came off almost
as in person like purple they didn't
have a good color payoff so the green
ones were the only ones that I felt
especially particular forest green that
I felt were great for me now to these
these are what they look like uh is in
ice now
I've had these for probably a couple of
days at this point and I will say this
hands-down these are the best contacts
that I've ever brought in a day of my
life okay when you get your context they
come with this OP case they come with
the each pair of each contact comes in
one of these little things and it's like
a a rubber piece here and then there's a
piece that you like an aluminum piece
you up to peel off so the company itself
I went to their site and I was totally
confused as to how to purchase a pair
these are a little more expensive I
think they're usually like 30 some size
I've seen it like 3738 dollars per lens
they don't sell them as a set they sell
them per lens they come from Brazil if
I'm not mistaken yeah they come from
Brazil
I actually purchase minds off of ebay
the reason being because the wait time
to get a pair of these is about three
months and I don't have three months I
have an event on June 10th that I have
to be it in full glam and I needed a
pair of color contacts to go with my
ensemble so I looked around and I was
afraid to get the ice ones because I was
afraid they were not gonna look like
this I thought they were gonna look like
I have in context I literally I feel
like I could get away with this even
though they're blue
I feel like they complement my eye color
so well that I could be a person with
blue eyes and knock a walk down the
street in Blanco has really nice eyes
now this these the great thing about
these is they don't have the ring around
the contact lenses and that's usually a
dead giveaway that somebody's wearing
them usually you can tell because the
whatever the graph or whatever is
monogrammed onto the actual lens is
usually very pixelated it's very big and
you can see that ring so I'll move this
so you can see that's what my natural
eye color looks like and this is what it
looks like with the actual contact lens
on top of it so you can tell that
there's no ring there's no brown showing
whatsoever besides the actual pupil so
I'll do this side so that's what it
looks like with the two and that's what
it looks like so yeah I get why people
say that these are some of the best
contacts that they've ever got a day in
their life because it is very true they
are worth every penny you can get away
and lie to people yeah and say that this
is your eye color and nobody really
whatever question even close up and
usually you can tell like if you stand
right in front of me you probably would
not be able to know that I'm wearing a
pair of contacts you would just think
their eyes were just naturally this
color which is crazy now I know you guys
going to ask about the comfort I'm the
comfort of these again the most
comfortable context and I have had some
contacts where I wanted to lose my mind
and call my eyeballs out because they
itch and it irritated and they moved and
it just felt I could feel them these are
so comfortable I have had them in for
today specifically for about seven hours
and I don't feel no discomfort at all
the only downside I will see if I look a
little
bit in the corners a little bit I see a
little bit of a haze on the side and it
could be because they are new because I
remember my desk Co wants to do that
when I first got them and the more and
more I work them the less and less I
would start to see like the little graph
or whatever or the fog in the sides but
I can see clear as day I have 20/20
vision so it doesn't drop I've driven in
these haven't had any issues I haven't
hit anybody I haven't rent on those
squirrels so I will say these and just I
just say this going to beginning of the
video but I brought these with my own
money
these are not this is not sponsor these
are not something that was sent to me I
actually paid my own money for these so
I'm giving you as I do with anything
whether sent to me or not my honest
review about these so the hydro Corps
ones are the ones that I purchased I
would like to try the natural colors
ones um I did a bit of research on these
particular contexts and I found this
girl who was really annoying and she
super annoying I just just that's what I
like to do videos y'all when I get to
the point cuz some people just want to
just do all this extra bullshitting you
like bitch do they look good or not can
you get a close-up are shut the up
um but she was really mad annoying but
she did give me a little insight on them
because she has a lot of colors that
she's tried and she you know tells you
which ones are the best um for your eye
color or this is that a third so I only
purchased this ice color because on eBay
this was the only seller that had a pair
so I checked last night and there's
someone else actually selling I think um
they're like the natural colors and I
think it's like a green color or
greenish gray color but uh mines came
within two days I talked to the seller
and it was like they they purchased by
accident two pairs of the same color and
it was like we can guarantee that
they're not open they showed me the
packaging there wasn't it they were not
and it takes like they come in these
these like vials in
you have to snatch the aluminum off to
get it out and you pop the top and then
actually get the contact out it's a lie
I get why they cost them as much as they
do because it's a lot they go with
packaging alone so it was a lot to come
to damn things out once I got them out
and got them in there were great oh the
box was still sealed when I got it so
yeah if I was you guys
I and you guys are into contact lenses
especially like makeup wise and you want
to change your eye color at your own
will I would definitely suggest silica
um I know that uh me and Brandon um
product we were talking months ago about
these and we were both wearing decía at
the time and he actually went ahead and
purchased a thing the ones he ran out
which are green and he really really
really really really really really
really liked them and he had semi a
video and he was like they're like the
best like I love these 100% more so I'm
actually happy that I got these so if
you guys are interested I will link some
videos below for you guys to get where
they got pretty much about theirs from
but if I was you guys and I don't you
don't want to wait three months I was
definitely a check eBay to see who has
someone sell because a lot of times what
they'll do is us sellers will buy them
out like a lot of them at a time and
then I'll sell them pilot for thirty or
forty dollars more than it normally
would cost because you're going to be
able to get them this quick versus
waiting three damn months to get a pair
of contacts which is really that's the
only downside every single review I
watched everybody was like that's the
only thing it takes for ever for
you to get them but once you get them
it's gonna feel like it was so worth it
so I hope you guys enjoyed this and a
last look of what they look like
mm-hmm and um I will catch you guys in
my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
