for my context Lagrange um that you guys
probably should have had a close up look
of in the beginning of this video so
last a contact video that I did was for
my silica so I like tikka whatever you
HOT over the hell you wanna call it um
it was for my ice in my hydric rice and
you guys know I love those so I was
trying to find another color that I
really wanted and I wanted to find a
company that had not three one shipping
so I got I got y'all back so again this
video is not sponsored by anybody I paid
with these with my own money so don't
believe that you know there's not a
company that send me these or anything
like that because I would have told you
if it was but I pay my own money for
these so these that I'm currently
wearing or my Heidrich or so ago and
these are in males so these are green
and we'll say these look super duper
duper D natural now these I got these
from Liz dot me and I was doing some
research about where other people got
them in China I was just trying to find
so many people that had them how long
did it take them because the three
months I wasn't doing so somebody
mentioned in the video that I watched it
was a review that they got theirs within
four days so I wanted to test a theory
out to see how long it would take and
indeed took 40 I think it's even three
days so when I received it they sent me
this and said you know draw on it and
they send me a thank you note it came in
this big box and its shipping from Dubai
when I received a my contacts I a came
with this case and what I've noticed and
I thought it was just a fluke the first
time my ice one's the case the color
part is actually blue this one because
they're green is actually green so if it
does help you know especially for
somebody like me when I'm trying to
figure out what is wood I know that I'm
not picking up the wrong
because my ice ones in the contact
solution they look clear so and then
these actually look green in the
container so I didn't get to show you
this in the last one but I don't think
so each one when you receive it
they each contact lens comes in one of
these two don't mind my hands my
lipstick guy everywhere so each one
ended on the back of this it'll tell you
how much strength you can get these a
lot of people and I I meant to mention
this in my last review but I just didn't
a lot of people ask me can you get these
prescribed if you have come if you wear
contact lenses and yes you can get to
prescribe if you have them you can
choose which strengths you have or
whatever your prescription is when you
actually order them they'll tell you the
prompt when you order for each eye so
when you do order you order them you can
order them as a pair but each eye has a
particular prescription that you can put
in it and you have like a stigmatism in
one eye you're good another eye mines is
zero zero because I can see so yeah
these are piece I believe they were like
30 something but together um for the
pair
I paid eighty nine dollars with tax and
shipping included it was expressed
shipping and it came through FedEx so I
ordered on a Monday Monday Tuesday so I
believe it was so it was either Thursday
or Friday I received a my but I believe
it was a Thursday and I ordered them on
like Monday night when I received them I
was super duper happy because knockabout
like every color when I paid for mine on
eBay I can't like 144 dollars for a pair
versus the $89 I got these for so I
definitely did overpay but because I
didn't know any better and I was not
waiting three months so now that I know
Lynn's dummy is a place to go
um they were very sweet I actually
contacted them through the what's app
and asked them Whizzer girl delivery
four days and they were like yes you
will get to our promise that you if you
do not get them before baby's your order
gonna be free so they make sure they got
here four days
um they're very comfortable
like I said about my other ones they're
very SuperDuper duper duper duper
comfortable and they look very very
supernatural so here's a bit of a
close-up of what they look like and they
look like mines here is in natural
sunlight it has a filter over it so they
do appear to be a little more browner
this photo does not have a filter but
these are what they look like and here
as well so they definitely look very
very natural for them being some just
regular context
I love how natural they look um
especially because I'm so used to my ice
ones which are super duper like bright
these have these look more like my
sister's eyes her eyes are naturally
green so these look like what hers look
like and when I put them in and we sit
next to each other we really look alike
then so yeah Lynn's got me amazing I'm
not wearing any more contacts from
anywhere else but silica inland I'm
doing this I'm good okay
um when I come back with some more
colors I will definitely let you guys
know how I feel about them these know it
just like my other ones I have no issues
with these I can see fine I actually
wore these for a couple of hours
yesterday
just to see how comfortable they were
because they were new my ice ones I wore
them to the mosquito fashion show so I
had them in over 8 hours and I didn't
want to take them out and I was drunk ok
I was Toa and I didn't want to take them
out because they were so comfortable so
yeah I've never slept in my contact life
people got an accent I've never slept in
mu I don't think that's not recommended
nor is that sanitary so I just wouldn't
do that um so yeah if you guys have any
questions please put them below and if
you guys want to see a specific color
let me know I'll buy them and review
them for you and maybe do a giveaway I
don't know not the ones I wear I'm about
new pair this to giveaway don't think
I'm nasty like that ok I get y'all in my
next one please</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
