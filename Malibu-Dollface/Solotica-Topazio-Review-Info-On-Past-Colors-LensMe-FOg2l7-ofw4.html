asking so I'm like well I'm here might
as well knock this out so my contacts
have been the subject of for a lot of
people and a lot of you guys have been
wanting to know what color that what
colors I've been wearing so I have since
my last review which was for my Mel
green ones so it would be this since
then I have gotten I think two more
colors which are I have my ice ones
where my original ones then I did the
mail I have these which are my soap as
the old ones and I have crystal and
natural colors but there's a there's a
catch to that so right now these are my
topaz EO ones I'm not to get all up in
my grill but as you can see these have
more like a green in the middle but
they're really like blue but from a
distance
most people say that it looks like my
eyes are great so um I went ahead and
ordered a whole bunch more and I have
other colors that I haven't tried yet
but as of right now natural crystal is
this these are the ones I wore when I
had the James Dean look that was Crystal
Pepsi commercial were the so Paseos I
will say solely tika is one of the best
companies when it comes to colors for
dark eyes and lens dot me is the best
company for four days shipping on
something that's gonna cost you two
months anywhere else so to these these
are my again my topaz iou's I was just
looking for something I was not as
bright as my other ones but I still
wanted them to have a bit of a color
payoff so I got them and I because at
the time I was wearing my ice ones so
much I didn't like how they looked the
one I need put one in so I was kind of
like I kind of liked it but not really
so it wasn't until I had to do the
Pepsi commercial and that's in black and
white so you can't tell what color my
eyes are but here's some footage of him
before it was like put in black and
white
and I was like oh my god they look
really good especially with the look
that I had so I tried them again and
people have been giving me crazy
compliments on my contacts even on
Instagram and maybe because he's just
not as vampy like my other ones kind of
gives you like the Vampira look cuz
they're very like kind of like
translucent whereas - these are bright
but they're not crazy bright you don't
saying they're bright enough but they
don't look crazy on me at least not to
me um they're very comfortable again I
still get a little bit in the side I
still get the grass just a little bit of
a look to this way but um I have had
these on for at least about four hours
at this point but when I first put them
in everything is super crystal clear is
that it is my day progresses I don't get
any discomfort I just get more so of a
it starts to get a little cloudy around
the sides now my crystals my natural
color crystals those are really bright
and though natural colors are opposed to
being natural colors they pose to look
more natural where is that those are
brighter than my Iceland so what
happened was when I first received them
some of the contacts when you do get
them they have a crack on both sides or
it's just kind of translucent in others
it's a graph on one side and then it's a
little lighter on the other side that's
what happened with those I put it in
backwards and it wasn't until I was
sitting back by some of my contacts in
like why do they look so not the color
I've been having like and do I have the
wrong one because you guys know me you
get the box and it comes with the case
in it I keep their original cases that
each pair came with and I thought okay I
put them in the wrong case maybe these
are the wrong ones but no I put them on
wrong so I actually have been wearing
them inside out and
this is the thing cuz I seen a lot of
other people say the same thing and I
didn't know they were inside out because
they were I had no discomfort at all
from them they felt just like these felt
so yeah I don't and because I'm sure if
you did this with a prescription in them
then you would probably be running into
traffic but because I have no strength
of mine at all it felt no different it
didn't look any different to me it just
felt normal
so I did try them on in their natural
state like the color and I just didn't
like it so I've been wearing them inside
out um I don't wear them as much anymore
since I've gotten these um I got them
all at the same time but I tend to wear
them as you know it's like if you
watched my videos you'll see which ones
I'm wearing at the time because most of
the videos would have that color in them
Goldie's birthday was recently and her
eyes are naturally green and she here's
a picture of her and I really drunk um
her eyes are naturally green she's like
I just wanted something that was like
gonna make my my natural eyes pop a
little bit more so she got ochre was we
were both like I kept telling her I
don't know if it's gonna do anything for
your iPhone on me yeah but on you I
don't know when she put him in they look
gorgeous they just gave her an extra
gleam like like two shades more than
what she already had so yeah I'm I'm
sold
I'm sold and Linda's not me one of the
best companies ever due to the simple
fact that I know no other company that's
gonna send my contacts this quick and
they come fully packaged fully anything
that I need you know I asked some
questions like if I ordered on this
debuts think I'll have it by this day
and they like go ahead and check out and
then well you know we were trying to get
him to you as soon as possible so for
those who keep asking the colors that
I've been wearing that you've been
seeing I've been looking a little gray
or actually blue and they're like blue
green like aquatic and um they're the
Topaz eo1 so if you're wondering what
the Topaz it looks like these are it and
shout out to salute it solely to cut it
