give me all your palm top Trender touch
me up after school you can be my baby
maybe like a potion whack what's up
folks hey what's up folks
Hey so we gonna talk about my colourful
hair today I kind of bust a rap but I
don't know how to rap but you know so
we're going to talk about this hell
there I is rockin and only out in three
bundles mmm look at me y'all I'm trying
to listen to my viewership so y'all you
know y'all sometimes be like you just do
a little less bundles but I want a flat
install boom so this hair is from spring
hair and you guys know a verbal spring
hair before and this is their Brazilian
straight hair and woo baby so let's
start off with the things I guess you
normally I'll do what I like and then
what I don't like so let's talk about
what I don't like so as you guys see I
bleached my frontal then I did the
actual hair then I did the bottoms of
the hair so I pretty much used bleach
three times on all of this hair and
again I only use three but wolf it's
like three bundles of some change
not exactly but somewhere in there is
three in some sense um so um my links
that they send me were 20 they said it
was 24 but it's a little longer so I'm
gonna say 26 cuz this is a little longer
than 24 for me um my frontal was uh 20
inches I believe here where this piece
is worth stuff so it's about 20 so when
I received the hair my hair was nice and
1b so I took my BW bleach which is this
bleach and I took a peroxide just like
this but it was 20 and I lifted the
color to a brown so this is like the
natural ground it would be once you lift
it I left it on for like 10 minutes and
all of my hair lifted so I made the
unit then I'll put the bleach on it then
I let it sit for 10 to 15 minutes and
then I took it off then after I'll let
it sit overnight conditioning I dried it
and then I went ahead and took the same
bleach and I took this 40 volume
peroxide and I left it on for 40 minutes
so I pretty much um braid all my hair
from here down after I rinsed it I use
this color which I've never used before
but it's called
raging color and it's called twisted
steel this is the color twisted steel
it's called twisted teal and this is the
color it is so I'm believing in
merchants particular darlin um I didn't
bleach my hair all the way like crazy
only because I was afraid that my herd
was going to get really crunchy and I
will say after I bleached it and left it
on for so long and I guess it might have
been the two um applications I did it
started uh my hair seemed like it
started to want to shed a little bit
okay so if I was you
I'll be very very careful with the color
on these particular bundles because uh I
don't recall of doing this with any of
my other hair like this amount of
bleaching but yeah once I bleached it it
did come um it was really light at the
ends but this is the color that it ended
up being becoming after I put the color
on it and this is nice pretty color um I
would've did did it from like here down
but I was afraid again that if I did too
much I was gonna end up with bald
bundles and a bald frontal I believe
done the knots on my front so so all of
this I believe she didn't have one issue
thank God I didn't have one issue with
bleach bleaching cuz you guys know I
just went through that where I had a
actual wig and it just went bleach but
the only thing that I will say that I
don't like about this hair and I've had
a lot of Brazilian straight hair the
only thing that I don't like about this
hair is that it did shed quite a bit
after I bleached it now I've used this
saying
in bleaching method on lots of hair
um US based hair other Aliexpress hair
I've had and I haven't experienced this
amount of much of shedding this amount
of much god is so terrible in my English
this amount of shedding so now I'm not
getting any but it was pretty bad in the
beginning but now it seems to suffice
and it's not as bad as it was or could
have been but I did notice that addition
quite a bit after I put the bleach on it
and if I was you guys I would probably
do it more so in steps I guess you could
say but because these are the regular
steps that I usually take I didn't think
that I was going to have a much of an
issue with it oh yeah now I'm not
getting much of anything I'm not getting
really much of anything but before it
was it was pretty bad and the reason why
I didn't put all my bundles in is
because one a lot of you guys want to
know how it would be if I use less
bundles and how full it would look
without four bundles versus three and I
was a little afraid if I put all my hair
in and then it did do what it eventually
did I was gonna have some bald bundles
so what did we didn't want that so I
went ahead and just only used three I
think I like use three about two extra
tracks just to close up the top but
that's about I make sure that it was
real flat because nobody wants a bulky
install oh so I'll give spring here a
seven you know because of the I don't
know if what why why this hair just gave
me the blues but it did
um plus that's kind of all I got to
really say um I do love this color I'll
talk more about the actual colour itself
um this is a great company I got this
color from Sally's uh you guys you know
I usually use a door for my color and I
love the door but this this because it's
so thick and it smells like bubblegum
it's really thick like you can't really
tell but it's ridiculous it's it's not
like
a door where it has more of a liquid
base that has more of a paste so when I
put it on the hair it stuck a little bit
better so it was like our greenish
bluish tillich color you know um but
yeah it sticks way better than a door to
me I think adore is great if you're
going to add that inner doors that's the
greatest combination ever but if you
just need that by itself it does cost
more though that is pretty much
equivalent to many panic so yeah if
you're looking for a color that's gonna
work I definitely would spend the extra
little coins on good old ragin color um
this is the first time I've ever got
this particular color or use this
particular brand but I'm happy as hell
with the results so if you guys are
interested more about this hair that I
have which is three bundles and a
frontal is a Brazilian straight um make
sure you guys click the links below and
let me know what other color you think I
should wear and I will catch y'all in my
next one cuz I think I mean like my
bantu tied my header</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
