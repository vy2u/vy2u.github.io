them deb-deb back tell me what's your
name tell me tell me what's your side
tell me what you win so tell me so I
want to say happy new year to all of you
cuz I know I haven't been on my channel
since my last video which was my Happy
New Year video what was kind of it was a
review but it was then every new year
but anyway I mr.anand got a Stine but
it's gone now so you know how to take a
little bit of a sabbatical um because
that's like you so anyway I'm back to
review this hair and closure that I am
wearing from start down
um this is another Aliexpress uh none of
you guys can see that it's another
Aliexpress company out of the box here
is a box um and it says star stylist as
L Express here it came with all of my
bundles in it this is fair hair that I
had left I had quite a bit of it left
and I am currently rocking four bundles
of 30-inch and I have an 18-inch closure
also cable is disease flexi rods which I
did not use because I happened to keep
the natural hair um
state of the hair in it I didn't want
really changing much so I didn't use
these but I'm starting to accumulate
quite a bit of these I remember having
to find these when I was just doing my
hair by myself
uh whoa when I was just wearing my hair
and trying to find these was so hard now
I have more than I can chew so yeah so
there so this is their body weight hair
so you guys I'm sure you guys see this
flow of looks pretty familiar to you
guys because this is what body weight is
like and like I said it before I am
rocking four bundles of thirty inch with
a 18 inch closure so what I did was when
I received here I wanted to do something
a little bit different and I wanted to
see how versus
till the hair was and I'm so over the
styles that I have been doing so since
this is a new year I'm like I'm doing
this style so I just wanted like these
little cute little milkmaid braids and
um they're into a ponytail in the back
here or glue them into something
smoother and then I just pulled the rest
of the hair forward and this is
something that's very easy it's very
easy to do I'm just simply parted my
closure as far as it will go back which
was here so I believe this is a four by
four closure
um and then I pretty much um burst all
my hair in this direction and my wig
stops right here where my edges are it
stops right here and then I braided my
hair and then slip my edges um like they
probably pretty much in here so if you
had like a sew-in
or the closure it would be the same
difference you just have to pretty much
disguise your tracks so nobody can see
but this will work great on a a full
lace wig this would be popping
I've done it still before on my Italian
yaki I went ahead and pressed it and
flatten it out and then swooped it and
then it just made these really thick
beautiful bright like my old braids
y'all you know okay
I'm am I giving you a little flashback
about how it used to be with the braids
no coming okay so anyway um to the hair
and my experience with it so far so good
um I will say one of the biggest
hang-ups that I have with this hair was
the amount of shading and I don't know
if that had to do with how again I cut
it and I installed it I don't know but I
did get quite a bit of hair um once I
started to wear it there kind of was
just coming out in clusters and again
like I told you guys one should wear
hair so long and eventually stops if it
don't didn't you should send it back or
contact the company and what you got it
from and say I don't really like this
hair because they keep shedding on me
and it keeps kind of like causing a
problem
um but yeah so far I love it I think
that is great for this particular style
um I didn't want to do my braids
SuperDuper neat because I find out when
um girls and guys tend to do this
particular style if you make it
it starts to look really fake so I did
my braids kind of big in some areas
tomorrow some areas I left a little bit
of hair out on purpose here I pulled
this out so it just looks like it was an
effortless day and I just wanted to be
like okay i'ma go I'll kick it look cute
in that situation so aside from the
shedding um it did have no crazy smells
you guys know spoke about the smells
it had no crazy smells um it comb like a
dream when I installed it the wefts were
good I know a lot of you guys often ask
me about the beards on the webs and I
don't always mention that but the beards
are really good because the thing about
beards is sometimes I don't know if you
guys are aware but when you have a tract
of hair and then the company produces
and they put another weft of hair on it
and you have these two short beards when
you put your weave in or your wig on
sometimes or when you want to do stuff
like this where you lay it down
maybe these little bits of hairs that
stick out which you didn't have to go
through and clip and that often comes
from the fact that sometimes the whoever
the vendor is they want to be a little
bit lazy about it and they don't want to
they don't want to go ahead and give you
a full weft so they're gonna give you
like half of a whip or just a little
short length so it looks thicker but
really it's the same size I'll explain I
split tracks and sing that's what the
little catch-22 is um but they didn't do
that it actually was very nice um a
co-wash like a dream so I didn't have an
issue with that I will do a video on
co-washing I'm gonna do a lot of more
hair videos like how to I did a video on
how to make a wig before but I guess no
one uh has been to my channel to watch
it got a lot of views but I guess y'all
not seeing it so I guess I could do
another one plus things have changed a
little bit I keep getting um questions
even though it's off topic about my
makeup and if I could do a tutorial so
I'll do that I don't know why I want one
okay um but yeah back to here I did not
put any color in it this is the natural
color that it it came with which is the
dislike 1b color and uh I don't know if
virgin hair is 1b unless it's by
Cambodian or something like that um and
it's it's a little darker it's brown but
it's a little darker brown then I'm used
to when I get my virgin hair if you want
to be technical you know but I do really
do honestly like this hair especially
with body wave here you guys know after
a while his hair sometimes depending on
where you go from it starts to act all
the way up and so far so good I just
didn't like the shedding and I did um
people that when I was pulling my
webster part it was you guys I told
y'all I don't never just go like this
always just pull the whole thing out and
see how my fingers run through it and I
usually tells me if the hair's gonna
last or if it's gonna be good or not and
when I did it it didn't it wasn't great
it took a minute um but yeah this is a
lot of this hair has a lot of
maintenance meaning you're gonna have
people brush on you um it's just that I
haven't that's why I opted to do my hair
like this because did this way I don't
have to worry about having a personal me
at all times but if you do you know
where it in its natural state like such
and you wear it out like with a side
part middle part and it's a lot of flowy
and once on the back of your neck it
much starts to want to grip up on you
because it kind of did that to me when I
was taking it out of the web but I do
like it the texture is nice I don't know
what it was treated with technically I
guess you want to say what it was
treated with um that is causing it to do
that because a really nice virgin hair
never does that
you know so I don't know so again this
is far styles Brazilian body wave you
guys know I did a video recently that
everybody really liked which was um some
other Brazilian hair that I had was body
weight as well but I kind of did the UH
flip over messing with it and it's
really pretty but I think this hair is a
bit cheaper than I hear so if you're
looking you're still trying to do that
style but you want some other hair
definitely check them out I'll come back
with this hair and I'm off set that up
as
I'm really gonna do this year I promise
you guys I'm gonna stick to my word come
back with this hair probably wipe in
another week or so and then see how I
like it cuz this is going to be the hair
that I were to run my errands and walk
my dogs so we're going to see how that
keeps up with the elements the weather
it's been raining a lot here so we're
just kind of going to see what it does
but um yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this
uh click all the links below follow me
on instagram at Malibu Dollface and if
you have any questions feel free to put
them on down below I'm not going to turn
around because I'm sure the back of my
head looks a mess because I did this
really quick but yeah I'll catch you
guys in the next piece</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
