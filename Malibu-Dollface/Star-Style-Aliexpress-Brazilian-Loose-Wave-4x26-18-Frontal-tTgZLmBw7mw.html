talk about everything I do cook a
great thing but I'm getting my baby
my buddy
they the ones confuse pain a salsa
tension
a couple dollars meanwhile I'm cool
these timers keep me cool they just make
a shoe always all right all right living
to me to be the he's gonna wear a
swimsuit with a rain jacket okay up to
class II all right take a rain check it
off so to my hair this look was inspired
by my friends named Leah she was
actually Selena for Halloween and she
wore this dye which I mean everybody's
wore the style at some point I bored the
spell but I really liked it and I wanted
to do it again so I found this really
cute a one piece from forever 21 and I
thought it would be cute okay so my hair
is from Starke style and you guys know
and I'll make sure I put the picture
since everybody was talking last time
this was all the hair that I different
starts out last time and this is what I
called the the Pia Mia so touch me um
although I just used the song and my
sister was working to this day that she
was inspiration and not period her
herself um for that look it wasn't I
just did it and she just happened to be
in my house and I was burning like her
okay so anyway um they sent me this hair
and I was very excited to review it
because this was a little bit different
than what I was used to was more curly
than wavy and the last I heard that they
sent me was by the way so I just wanted
to see kind of how it was going to work
so they Samia frontal so all of this in
the front is not mines people and I
purposely left my lace a little exposed
just to prove that this is not my hair
so as you look you can see you can see
the laser right now so yeah it's not
mine at all this is what it looks like
and person can't tell it all but on
camera because I'm in front of this big
ol light you obviously can you can tale
so to this hair yeah so this here is
from Star style which I'm sure you guys
cannot
on that one I like that and this is as
you guys I like to show you guys the
mess that I made doing my hair uh we
talked about this back and I think the
March if I'm not mistaken is when they
sent me this hair and I've had it since
so they was like what do you want to do
um like a loose wave and I was like ok
cool because last time I did body wave
and you guys know I'm over body wave so
I said ok cool so when I received the
hair it came with this front tool and
then it came with this hair I don't
remember what all my limbs were but I
have a sneaking suspicion because this
is the only thing that's been left from
the packaging is this one y'all can't
even see that but it's this one and it
says that this is a 26 inch and judging
by how my hair is falling this been a
minute but I believe I have them for
2060 and I believe my from soul is 20
inches a lot of you guys asked me after
I did my tutorial what kind of caps I
use and I didn't realize how fast it was
in the actual video so these are the
caps that I use which are these spandex
caps and I get these from Sally's um
just a little background the reason why
I fold the cap up underneath I mean up
on top of each other is because it gives
the band in the back for the week that
you're going to make a little bit more
support although these are very good
because they're made to for you to sleep
in they also are very good and I also
like the photo because if you notice
there's a little more material at the
top so since I don't have all this
looseness um I just fold it up
underneath and it works and then they
sent me um for which I don't know what
for flexi rods would have done but they
only sent me four of these which I keep
I always keep my place runs because you
never know when you're gonna need them
and just not too long ago when I did my
green hair I use flexi rods um after I
curl it to keep them up so I always keep
these but I just don't know what for
would have done for this so to the hair
itself um I will say that I do like what
it is which is a loose way I do like
this but I have had the utmost tangling
with this hair it is very hard to really
from me personally to me
when I received it it was uh each one
because I have four bundles so it was
one it was two bundles and they were
wrapped with in each other and they were
wrap very tightly I will show y'all
would it look like but my phone froze
and bricked on me so I'm starting over
yeah none of them say so yeah how about
that but anyway um yeah they were what
they were very tight so that's how it
ended up with this curl at the bottom
when I watched it I realized that it did
fall a little bit so I just took my wand
which is my Remington one I think it's
like the half inch one and I just curled
all of these just really tightly and I
left them sitting for about a couple of
days and then I just combed them out and
that's how I got this look so it did it
definitely didn't stay how I wanted to
when I first got it it looked like this
um but in order for me to keep it like
this I see I have to make sure that I
keep it curled because if I don't then
it's going to end up kind of looking
like more like a body wave than a loose
wave I I'm not crazy about it how was my
body way from them it's kind of
satisfactory it's kind of okay I'm not
like I hate it by any means cuz I think
it looks amazing
but it's just vicious a lot of
maintenance and I don't like here that
requires a lot of maintenance and
usually depending on what type of hair
type it is it would be okay so that's
why a lot of times I tell people when
you get curly hair when you get straight
hair it just depends on what you plan to
do with it because not all the time are
you going to love it you know and for me
personally I just was like I don't I
don't this is this is like a summer by
the pool looking cute look but this is
nice I went in the water with this oh no
oh god no um that's my only thing that's
my only gripe but the hair is really
nice I didn't put anything extra in it
after I washed it eh I wish I could see
when they dried after I washed it it
looked kind of it looked more like this
so this kind of a wave is what as
opposed to what you see at the bottom
which came from the wand so I'm not like
I said I'm not crazy about it because
it's a lot of maintenance
um I will say that with this one I did I
didn't get any shedding um and I did a
lot of you guys asked me a lot of times
do I
I usually don't cut the West on my
straight hair um I mean all my curly
hair or my wavy hair but I did recently
when I was using when I did my tutorial
I did cut them but this one I didn't cut
so I'm getting very minimal shedding um
I'm just getting a lot of tangling and
that's the thing that I'm not crazy
about because as pretty as the hair is
and the prettiest look is it kinda I was
pulling teeth to get it you know it was
it was a lot for me to get to this point
and I don't think that the hair is bad I
just think that you got to do a lot of
maintenance to upkeep something like
this because if you don't what's going
to happen is you're gonna end up with a
hole you're gonna get with a bird's nest
of a problem so if you're one of those
people who are you don't wrap your hair
at night um you don't know how to
detangle you do not use conditioner on
your tracks anything like that then you
probably will have a hell of a time
trying to do with this if you are a
person who wears wigs like myself a
frontal and you just really want um you
know just something really cute that you
can pop on and pop off did by all means
it will not hurt if you can take this
off and you don't have to continuously
wash it a lot Lord I think you're going
to be fine but if you're one of those
people who are just very carefree and
you want some type of hair that's just
going to do its own work this ain't for
you I'm just going to UM be honest with
you and this ain't for you I love it for
what it is it's a uh you know up to
hundred we can make it work but it just
depends on for what you know what what
what I'm doing um like I said I would
wear this to the pool I would wear this
to the pool I would not get in the pool
with this no like I said it will
probably lock up on me and because of
the chlorine and because of whatever
they use to keep the hair like this it's
probably just not going to agree with
the chlorine it's going to be a bit
problem but like I said it depends on
you as a person so if I grade this hair
from what I know and hair that I wear I
would give this hair a c-plus um because
it's not the worst hair when it comes to
curly hair or wavy here but definitely
not the best hair and for me
the best hair would it be here that I
could kind of run my fingers through no
matter how tight of the curl and again I
put these in myself so some of them are
falling and that's just kind of how I'm
wearing it but I do like to wear my hair
curly like this when my hair has a
little bit of texture in it already
because it makes it easier to hold a
curl it's very hard to get straight here
to hold
um because it's meant to be straight so
it wants to just lay it doesn't want to
sit but this had some type of texture to
it so my hair was easier for me to put
into the ponytail it was easier for me
to it look more like my stitch it's not
bone straight at the root has a little
bit of texture to it and then the hair
itself now I will say this I bleached a
piece and it came out really nice and it
was still very soft however it was very
loose after I did it and a lot of times
with hair that's usually what it is if
you put a little chemical on it it was
going to act very different with you so
in this situation I will say that this
yeah this star style love y'all but I
gotta keep your real in a sequence
that's all I got for you
um but yeah you guys are interested in
you want to try it out you want to make
it into a wig
it's beautiful hair this is you know
pretty much what it look like when I
first received it I washed it it kind of
got a little bit on flat on me just took
my rimming someone went around it not
for that long I would just hold it for a
second let it go hold it for a second
let it go the next day which was
yesterday um I went ahead and threw
these in here and then today this is my
result so yeah um if you guys like I say
are interested put it down below and I
believe I have a 20 inch frontal and 226
inch bundle
I mean 426 inch bundle see I'm all over
the place I'll catch on to my next one
and I know somebody gonna ask me what
kind of lipstick I'm wearing I'm wearing
