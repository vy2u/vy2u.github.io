why you gotta come to this
can't get god of dawn stones at a glass
if you look alright guys cuz I was on
Instagram but it's going to be review
for this hair that I'm rocking currently
and when I tell you guys right now this
is by far the best hair that I have had
on Aliexpress okay believe me when I
tell you this hair is some of the best
hair so you guys know I have been on the
hunt for some good Aliexpress hair okay
and I think I found it at least not on
straight hair but this is some body
weight hair that was sent to me by this
company which is called I think like I
want to say a stem hair um and this is
the bag that they sent with the bundles
that I currently have in and this is
what I have this piece of my cab but
this is what I have left which is just
this I could have fit this in here I
just didn't so I am currently rocking
four bundles of 26 inch with a matching
body wave 18 inch closure okay now I did
my hair like this because recently this
is what I dispel I've been wearing and I
really like this effortless throw over
whatever style and this hair y'all can
you do you see what I mean now I don't
know a lot of you guys always ask me um
how do you get your hair in this
particular state whoa or how do you work
hair do you buy to make it look like
this and you just buy a body wave hair
and then when you take body wave hair
apart it does this and if it's nice hair
it will stay like this like this after
you wash it when it dries it'll dry like
this again so y'all this I've never
worked with this company before Italy
not to my knowledge I don't recall ever
working with this company before they
said they wanted to send me on point
they want to send me four bundles of
hair which is very rare because a lot of
times on how to express they do not want
to send you long hair they want to send
you of 18 inch or 16 inch or whatever
which is fine but when it comes to
certain hair they do not want to send
you long hair so when I said that I'm
like okay like we want to send you you
know our body wave hair because we
really is like one of our best selling
hair and we really want you know to send
it to you so you can review it and see
how you really like it if you don't like
it still you know let people know you
know what your personal views was but
you pretty much have rein to do what you
want to do which I always do but a lot
of times companies try to say without
saying say that you like it even if you
really don't like it don't say nothing
bad and it's not I mean that's not how
reviews go is either you like it or you
don't or as satisfactory but this hair
100 again across the board look how
beautiful this is all and this is after
and co-wash okay a car wash look
how nice this is
and the thing about hair that is like
this when you wear it is that after a
while when water his it itches to want
to get like curly straight and it
doesn't are wavy straight rather it
doesn't really want to stay in it in a
great state like this but yeah baby this
is so freakin cute I love this okay and
I know a lot of you guys are like a mind
you um i the closure that I have in is a
regular lace closure
um the closure was very easy to sew one
because it didn't have that really thick
band around it have a band to stop me
from stretching but it's not a band that
is you know trying to get a needle to it
is a bit of some other problem um I love
was going to kind of do this style with
this so I didn't really care if it was a
lace or silk base I wasn't really
mindful and in really care but I'm just
happy that it actually blends with the
like it was they were both the same
exact texture now this is the first time
I've ever worked with this company when
I did wash my hair I got a minimal
amount of shedding and when I say a
minimal I mean like about this much so
and that's a lot to you
don't do it again this is um originally
it has the s way which is the body wave
I currently don't have any pictures of
how it looked my first guy but I have
the classic by the wave look to it it's
not nothing spectacular um and then when
you pull that apart then it starts to
give you this nice S wave and then if
you are co-washing like I did and then
let it air dry it'll give you this nice
natural wavy feel Ollie okay so this
comes with tip for hair care which is
here and then it also comes with the $20
off with this particular information to
just be 100% honest with y'all I would
totally recommend this hair I really
would if you're going for this look are
you going for this natural look cuz I'm
giving you Spanish wave right now
they're Hawaiian tropics my sister said
that I'm very reminiscent of Hakeem's
new little girlfriend on Empire not my
face just my hair um but that's what she
said
it reminds her of so yeah I've had this
hair for who knows it's been a minute
and you guys know how I am with hair
I'll take one off put one on next day
I'll put that one back for and take that
one off wear this one for a week wear
that one and then go back and forth a
lot of my hair scouts have been looking
a lot like this just like very natural
um but this is by far one of my
favorites
you know um it did have it shedding
moment when I was watching it of course
but other than that I'm not really
getting any shedding my scene yeah I'm
getting like this so that's about three
and like I told you guys whenever I'm
hair is that's one whenever here is
and then they'll have none so yeah it
just really depends
whenever hair has a texture to it you
keep running your fingers through it
you're gonna start to get a bit of uh
you're gonna start to snag and pull the
wefts were very well constructed which
I'll show you less that they sent there
came from the bundles that I have in
which are these and these are machine
tied webs um they're pretty good and I
had no issue with the thread coming to
lose I had no issue with them being too
thick where the needle didn't want it
because I like to put my needle through
the beginning not it and then you know
go ahead and look the rest but yeah and
this is what it looks like when I first
first got it so we'll see if it still
blends um it's a little more se time so
uneducated as you a little more as
pattern here and a little more looser
than this does but if I can guarantee is
the same here well it's a little like
it'll blend more on this side this is
their Brazilian body wave and it has no
like the hair is very soft and it's very
light it has no smell to it whatsoever
the issue a lot of times I have an
Aliexpress here is that sometimes there
is a stench of something just one review
recently I told you guy that it had a
scent of relaxer to me this hair has no
smell at all it smells pure wah you know
go wash do it just smells like the
Giovanni's a teacher c'mon conditioner
that I use but besides that when I first
received it if there was no smell to it
and I only co wash it to kind of see
what they do in water bleh yeah this is
some of the best hair I've ever had from
Aliexpress hands down y'all got my yah
gamma is still of approval with this one
and your closures are very nice too so
if you guys looking for some affordable
closures and some nice hair I would give
them a nice nice nice try and then let
me know how you like your hair I
freaking love this
guys I can't say anything L better but I
really like a lot um I kinda because
only only because I have here like this
I come on one and give this away and
they give away to somebody who don't got
no hair like this um but I'm gonna be
like selfish right now and I'm gonna
keep it because I really liked it
I'll put the information the pillow and
let me know what you guys like and I
will hit y'all later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
