stop being scared of your dreams um
recently I'm not gonna say what it is
because I don't like to talk about
things until they're finished but
recently I've started something that has
been a lifelong dream of mines and I'm
so happy because things seem to be
working out with that in just my life
and everything very good and for a very
long time I was afraid to be great I was
afraid that if I tried this and it was
good I'm I was afraid and then I finally
just one day said you know what either
it's gonna happen or it's not gonna
happen and it's turning out to be
everything I wanted and more and a lot
of people are afraid to reach their
highest potential and anything that they
do because they don't know how to
basically I don't guess they don't know
how to handle it they don't know who
where to go with it they don't know how
to take it in they don't know any of
that but and they won't do it because
they're scared of that you know people
get to a point where they right there
but they'll stop at the door and say I
don't want to do it and you'd like why
you don't want to do I'm scared it's
like once 100 house and you know what
it's gonna be and you know you can get
through it and you know it's it's
nothing's gonna hurt you but you won't
go through it you rather wait at the
exit because you don't wanna have to
deal with everything that's in between
everything that is great comes from hard
work people do not sit back and try
things until they can't try them anymore
everybody just wants things to be
instant I want it now and life does not
work like that dreams do not work like
that there are people who have been
working at their dream for years and
they finally got what they want because
they never gave up and I'm not saying
that everything is for everybody some
people have dreams that are just not
tangible and they ever I can't be no
singer as much as I love music and all I
still can't be no damn singer cuz it
just ain't gonna work I can't hang out
at home I can't sing I sound like oh I
started a cat in a washing machine it's
just bad but I can do everything else so
the thing that I want to tell you guys
and try to open your mind to do is
you'll never know unless you try I can
say I can't see I tried it it didn't
work
I can
say that with much confidence so
somebody ever asked me well you have to
look at I get this all the time you have
the look of an artist you should be an
artist and I'm not I can't sing I can't
rap I can't do nothing musically
inclined but hum and lip-sync so that
technically would be drag race if you
wouldn't think about it and I'm not
doing that unless the money went up I'm
not a drag queen but I get called this
 all the time anyway I might as well
make some money off this you know off
topic so the thing is I want you guys to
start what I decided to do and what
helped me is I took a dream that I had
and I was scared to basically do
anything related to it because I didn't
know how I was going to turn out and
then what I decided to do was I said I'm
gonna do half of it and if I get to half
of it and things are still good I'll
keep going so what I did was I started
it I did half of it and things were good
and I kept going and then I kept going
and then I'm done and it literally I was
rifling back and forth with this and
dealing with this and trying to figure
out what I wanted to do for like a year
and a half like legitimately it was like
how do you make a dream come true and
how do you start to put your all into a
project that you're not for sure that
you can actually like it will actually
work
you know I'm Sam so that's that makes
sense that's not stupid that's called
human nature is called fear so I allowed
to put my I just put my my scared miss I
guess you could say my afraid Natur a
second and kind of just kind of seen it
for what it wasn't and it worked out so
that's what you say if you if you don't
do anything this year just try to at
least attempt something that you're
afraid to tackle it could be anything
from touching a snake to trying to open
a new business to trying to get clients
for hair and makeup whatever the
situation is whatever you're scared to
do because you're scared of your
potential whatever the situation is then
try it because what that does is it help
you it helps you hinder they don't help
you in their
it helps you build your craft so when
you find out what's wrong with it you
can fix it if you don't know what's
wrong with it are you scared of what it
is then you can't fix nothing but some
people their issue is this they don't
want to work they just want like instant
gratification like now like this is not
Popeyes this is not ramen noodles it's
not gonna happen in 10 seconds and then
you have a result it's it takes work and
a lot of people are lazy today they
don't want to work they don't want to
work for anything there are people who
are out here who swear up and down their
looks are gonna get them everything and
they want to get old and corroded and
rusty and crusty and nobody cares
anymore then they're gonna feel like I
should have tried this when I have the
ability to do it but they didn't because
they thought they looks we're going to
get them everything
so if you are you can draw if you can do
hair if you can do makeup if you can fix
a car whatever the hell it is try it if
you have a passion to do it then try it
because it's not a they can only tell
you yes or no it's not rocket science
damn it is yes or no will you help me
won't you help me is it gonna work if
they're not gonna work what are the two
but if you're not even willing to go
that far then you're gonna look back
honestly on life and say what the hell
did I do I have a job that I've had for
the last thirty years that I hate going
to but the only reason why I go is cuz I
got a pension and I got a retirement and
I'll be taking care of uh security but
you don't have nothin to show for your
dreams that's a problem because the
point of life is to live it you're not
living if you're doing something you
don't like you know I feel like once you
allow yourself to go to work and you
love your job like wholeheartedly you
will never work a day in your life when
you find something to do you'll never
work a day in your life if you find
something that you just truly are
passionate about Steve Jobs was
passionate about computers he was
passionate about that he he found
out how to make Macintosh the ish and
now it's Apple and rest his soul Steve
Jobs is gone but he has it's a
billion-dollar company that's being ran
that he started from what he just loved
so
look at these people you look at looking
at Britney Spears look at if you want to
look at a celebrity you look at
celebrities who have their pot in their
hands and everything because that's how
they continue to make money but they
also are able to live a very lavish life
because they figured out how do i into a
market that i actually do like that I
actually feel it's something that will
sail but also something that I can
actually get into you don't want to get
into something you're not passionate
about because eventually it's gonna blow
away
I remember for the longest time I wanted
to do fashion and I wanted to learn the
song and I and I still kind of do but I
know for a fact I would want to do it on
my own time if I had a line and I had to
start making clothes no hell no there'll
be garments not finished there'll be
things that you just don't want to do I
went to beauty school and I don't regret
going because I learned so much and I
learn so many different techniques but
it just was such a my mother suggested
that I go that's what the thing I was
trying to figure out him what I wanna do
I'm on high school what do I want to do
in life my mother was like wouldn't you
just go to beauty school you do here
anyway don't you go so I was like
alright it seems like the most plausible
thing to do why I do it I wouldn't have
hated it I mean I didn't hate it in the
moment but when I got out of it it kind
of defeated the purpose of me going cuz
I didn't want to go there anymore
so cuz it was so much and it was every
day of my life it burned me out I was
like mm-hmm
I just can't see myself standing behind
a chair doing someone else's here when I
feel like I'm not better than that but I
feel like I should be the one getting my
hair done I should be the star of the
show I shouldn't be the assistant I
should not be the person behind the
scenes and everybody doesn't necessarily
want to be in front of the camera I'm
one of those people so in doing that I'm
gonna make sure that that happens for me
and I'm able to start to fulfill these
dreams and these passions in these
aspirations that I have because if I do
not it's never gonna happen and I'm
gonna already know myself every day I'm
gonna get a pissed off in my life and
then I don't want to become cuz I know I
will I'll become like JonBenet Ramsay
mama where I'm just like out here trying
to you know your your daughter your son
is out here doing something
and entertainment related and you were
like you know back in the day I was
really popping on YouTube and I could do
this and I used to mingle with this and
I did I don't want to be those people
but I feel like I would be that person I
don't what opinions are no kids so who
knows I probably would be like Iron Man
bears my child like that but there
that's why a lot of parents do that
because in their heyday that's what they
were doing and something that happened
either they got pregnant or they just
didn't want to do it they had the
passion to drive to do it no more now
their kids are doing it they're trying
to live through them I don't want to
live vicariously through nobody but
myself for my own damn dreams and you
should do the same because it's
pointless to go through life and have a
whole bunch of regrets in what ifs I
think the only person that can ever stop
you in life is a person in the mirror
nobody can tell you that you can't do
something but your damn self cuz ain't
nobody else gonna get you up in the
morning ain't nobody else gonna you know
nobody knows your thought process nobody
knows what you're going through but you
so don't let yourself be your worst
enemy and we tend to do that like you'll
start telling yourself no you can't do
that you won't be able to do it you
won't be able to reach that you won't be
able to to start something and change
something and start a movement oh you
can't do that you believe it then it'll
happen and then the sad thing about it
the hurtful thing about it somebody else
comes right through and do it just like
that
and you sitting back like damn so it was
that easy and I just didn't take the
plunge that sucks
so don't be that person do not and um
you know just kind of go with the flow
life is supposed to be fun it's supposed
to be something that's not difficult
it's supposed to be something we are
grateful to have so when you have
something like life that is so grateful
and so precious and so short make sure
that you try to for every opportunity
that you get that you feel is for you
because everything ain't for you but
everything that you feel deeply and
passionate about that is for you you
take it and you figure out how you can
make those those lemons into lemonade
because trust me it will pay off in the
end
and with that said I love you guys
thank you guys for watching and thank
you guys for hanging in there with me in
having laughs and cries and everything I
do this for the people I don't do this
for a check although I receive a chick I
don't I do this just for the check I do
this for the love of the people I reply
back to you guys because I feel like if
you don't have nobody to turn to at
least you can turn to me you know and I
may not be able to hit you back directly
but like this I'm able to talk to you
because I don't know what you guys are
going through but this helps me help you
which helps me feel like a better person
like I've done something like it's not
all cuz it's not always about me you
know it's not always was never really
about me let everybody else tell it but
it helps me be in touch with you guys
when I see you guys say this really
helped me because this is exactly what
I'm going through that was my purpose so
I love you guys and I will talk to you
later and I hope you guys had a
beautiful day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
