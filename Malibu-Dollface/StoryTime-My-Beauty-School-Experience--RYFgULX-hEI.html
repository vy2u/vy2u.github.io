story time um and it's going to be about
my beauty school experience because I
found out recently they're my school
doesn't even exist anymore so uh often
on my channel a lot of you guys I refer
to especially when I'm doing hair or
anything of that nature I refer to
myself going to beauty school um I don't
think that I'm gonna just start off by
saying is I don't think that it's a
requirement by a long shot but I
definitely hope oh if you plan on being
like a stylist of some sort you're gonna
need those hours cuz you're gonna need
those to go to the State Board and get
your license oh yeah so sit back cause
it's gonna be kind of lengthy so around
like 2005-2006 I was in doing anything
with my job I was kind of just sitting
back relaxingg Maxon and my mom came up
with the bright idea to say hey I think
you should you know do you want to go to
beauty school I was like no I didn't
want to do no school after high school I
was like I will never do any more school
you guys know I will get into that in
this every video I hated high school
because it was I just it was just a lot
I don't like getting up in the morning
you guys know if y'all know me y'all
know I sleep too nice and three o'clock
an afternoon so yeah it was just a whole
lot and I loved things about school but
it was not enough to want to do it again
so when she brought this to me I was
just kind of like a know just absolutely
not
she told me think about it I thought
about it and I was like okay well at
least cuz at this particular point none
of my friends were doing anything we
were going to her if you guys knew me
from MySpace you guys know I was going
to movie premieres like every other day
I was at parties I was doing everything
at 18:19 that you know I wasn't supposed
to be doing so I wasn't in a
relationship anymore at that point I was
just kind of good you know I just wanted
some free time to me time but it doesn't
always work so I had to kind of get on a
good foot so I was like okay well I'll
go just to kind of see how it is so at
the time I had a friend who went to a
junior high school with me and she was
currently enrolled
so I asked her a couple of questions
about it and she was like yes this is
that any other and if you guys are from
LA of any short you guys will know an
Engel it is and you guys will know where
Market Street is so the school was
Maranello school beauty and it was on
Market Street and I was like okay this
should be fun this should this should be
you know so I kind of went up to kind of
get a vibe and everybody seemed very
cool just you know you have your
ratchets you have those the the more of
the hood of the bunch but it was still I
think cool it wasn't nothing that wasn't
a you know didn't know about you know I
grew up in the hood so it wasn't like oh
so I went ahead and filled out the
application got in and I remember the
first day of getting air I was so
nervous because I'm like it's I've been
out of school for like a year and a half
two years at that point so I wasn't used
to this structured life so I'm like oh
god what did I sign myself up to like I
mother so failed so bad so I remember it
was raining that day and my friend that
to this day I love you to death girl uh
we called it kilo kilo low kyla but she
was the first person that I had met so
we were sitting in the lobby and we were
having I don't remember what the
conversation was about but it was just
like were the first two people here so
okay because you have all the seniors
who are already on the floor we're
freshmen so we don't know nothing about
nothing
so um somebody else that I knew how to
actually enrolled to now my friend
Nicole was supposed to enroll with me
this was supposed to be us and then at
the last minute her ass dropped out and
was like I'm not gonna do it so I
literally was by myself so I get into
the freshmen room I only know Kyla and
then it was another girl that I knew
that what did your high school of me as
well named Asia so we were all kind of
starting out together so nobody really
knew everybody just kind of like hey you
know we all we all in the bucket and
gonna kick the bucket it's what it is
so you're in the freshmen room I believe
for about
two months and then you graduate and you
go downstairs and then you start to have
clients I remember the first that
freshman week was rough for a player
okay because I just wasn't used to being
around people like that I wasn't used to
having to get up I wasn't regimented to
do anything I couldn't remember like
what was what we have all these doll
hands we had this big-ass bag was full
of clips they had curlers in it it was
just and I'm just thinking to myself
like oh my god I made the wrong decision
like this is something I shouldn't I
don't want to do this so you're only
allowed to miss because I went for full
time I wouldn't doing the nose so I went
for full time and you're only allowed
for those ten months that you're there
to miss 15 days
okay now remember I told you guys that
you're only in the freshmen room for two
months by the third week I was out of
time I had used every 15 days up okay so
now what happens is they had it anything
states in your contract that you would
have to make like with the month the
days you went over you would have to pay
them back money as if you were at a job
so if your job is giving you a 50 I
would have to pay them back 850 for
every hour that I went over those 15
days so they but they'll they say they
don't work with you and good for me and
school I always learned to be a good
student so if I ever need something my
instructors our teachers would be more
happy to oblige
finally get all of our stuff we kind of
get in the swing of things and at this
point we were probably there for about
it was learned almost on two months so
it started to become very normal to me
at that point I was getting up on a
regular basis I was doing what I was
supposed to be doing and because I went
over those days I knew that you ain't
really got much of a choice because
you're able to drop out I think the
first week that you're there and you
won't be charged anything and you get
like your initiation
see or your entry fee which I think was
like a hundred and eleven dollars you
get that back
so for me I was just kind of like I
don't know but I guess I'm just gonna
roll with it so I remember going
graduating to the floor okay it's what
we call it and getting my first client I
would never forget this girl her name
was cinnamon and she asked me for a
person curl well when you learn in
school for pressing curl even in your
book a pressing curl is you press it and
you curl it okay whoa
because I was in the hood oppressing
curl meant you pressed flat iron and
that was it
so Doug I got the ticket and said
Preston curl
I literally Shirley Temple this girl's
whole entire head she was pissed off she
was mad when she went in the bathroom
and called her mom and I'm just kind of
like oh good so this is what my life is
about to be right now but nobody
explained to me that this is what you do
here okay this is the curriculum for
Inglewood this is not necessarily the
curriculum for life because some people
will say press and curling they really
mean that but for us that really just
meant pressed flat iron there you go so
that was a lesson learned um once I kind
of got there when I first went my hair
was short and it was curly that's how I
was wearing I think I had like a taper
at the time and when you're in school
you are you have all these products
available to you everybody wants to do
something so for me it was : um my cut
my hair was this color in school it was
when I first got there it was red orange
and um black so my roots were black the
tips were red and the middle was orange
and all of it was an accident
so I got to be known as the boy with the
blue hair or the boy with the colored
hair so that's how my clients would
start booking me and I will say this you
learn a lot
because there's a book and there are
your chart is laid out with your time
part of all the things you have to do in
order to get your 1500 hours and I
learned the basics really quick all the
stuff that you guys know me to do now I
learned that from the girls that I went
to school with so the girl that I told
you about Kyla she was the one who got
me into color okay she's the one who
explained just simple things to me and
she's from Texas so you know they don't
play in Texas and she I remember she was
the first person who taught me how to do
a quick weave I didn't know what the
hell would do I didn't know you could
glue tracks to a cap like I didn't know
that was even an option so I learned
that from her it was another girl I
learned how to break I know how to do a
fishtail from a girl named Yvonne um it
was just what I will say is that I
learned way more than I had anticipated
when I first initially went because I
didn't know what it was going to be and
then you have all of these different
people from different walks of life that
are teaching you all of these different
techniques that they've learned and they
picked up you know only I could do when
I got there was press that was it I
compress your soul but even that needed
work because I still learn things while
I was there you know it was a boy named
Kenneth that was there and me and him
really just didn't we didn't mesh very
well but I hear great things that he's
doing and I'm happy for him um it just I
met a lot of talented people and I think
whatever like I went into the situation
like I don't want to do this but then it
turned out to be great things so even
the way that I a lot of people give ask
me questions about how straight I get my
wigs and my leaves I learned that in
school and I learned that from a little
hairspray a little present home in a
good Flatiron to take you very far and
if I wouldn't have went I don't think
that I would be standing here right now
so I want to thank my momma momma thank
you
Oh cuz she kind of pushed me to do it
and maybe I wouldn't be standing here if
didn't go to beauty school but it was
just a great experience for me and for
me because I didn't go to college that
was my college because I was going with
people that were younger than me and I
was part of the youngest group there and
then people who were about as old as my
training so it was just a plethora of
folks that went there and we all had our
moments you know I always say if reality
shows were what they were then that they
are now we would have been a top-rated
on vh1 cuz it was all miss boy from my
instructors just everybody I just want
to thank them I heard the school now has
no accreditation so how about that um
but just everybody from Kyla to um
Yvonne to Sherry of mr. Tubbs um miss
Lindo um oh you know just everybody miss
bibs everybody that I went to school
with Kenisha everybody that was there
taught me so much that I can do now and
all of that came from cuz you did you
guys warned you we was there from 8:30
in the morning to 5:00 and afternoon and
then when I had to serve hours so I
gotta tell you other board
so who member I show you guys that you
have to pay the school back after you go
over your hours well my instructor works
something I work as long as I would
serve those hours in night school which
night school was from 6:00 to 10:00 I
believe that was part time for the
part-time people so all was there from
8:30 in the morning - oh yeah about
10:30 at night
serving hours because I decided I didn't
want to wake up on 15 days so if you
commit to something folks make sure you
do it because you end up like me and I'm
gonna tell you when I got out of school
I will honestly say I did not want to do
hair hair was the furthest thing from my
mind and I think it's like with anything
when you have something that you really
like and then it's kind of pressed down
your throat so much it makes you not
want it anymore if you eat too much ice
cream you're going to eventually get
sick so for me when I got out of school
it was everybody was like we have to go
to the board I want to get my life
I might to do this how much to do that
and I was like babies I got my hours and
I pieced out and that was it
I didn't want to do it here no more
so when I got on YouTube it was my video
started off like about talking that was
all it was was just like me talking
about things that I felt but I would
make sure that my hair was done in every
video because again I learnt the tray I
just didn't want to do it as a
profession that doesn't mean that I
didn't know how to do it I just didn't
want to so I what make sure my hair was
done and then I would get all these
questions about my hair in the comments
and I'm just kind of like okay do you
really want to know up because I went I
took it as everybody knows this but
clearly not so I did
Sheena's hair and for him I did those
reviews and then that spiral to me to
where I am today so my experience was
one of the most I was like positive
experiences for me going down and making
something because I a lot of my friends
who went and they work at shops now
their own shops now they own um you know
hair companies and stuff like that
for me it turned out to be a different
thing still we're still in the hair
industry I'm just not in it as a stylist
technically I'm a stylist for the people
on myself versus a stylist that has
clients so it's a bit different see it
was Sheree Kim uh Erica DJ Jen uh dawn
dawn was my homie
dawn was like he's a cold with a big-ass
booty and a big mouth and that we was
right and I she was actually the first
person I knew who had blue hair and I
seen hers and really wanted it and then
it became my signature which is funny
because I had just did red um who else
went to school Oh Nancy uh Tanika Tanika
wasn't she my yoga uh other backstory
Tanika sister was the first person to do
the braids that I am now known for so
Tanika had them in school and then at
the
time Tiffany was like working on what
she was doing and she was like um Tanika
sister he had did my hair but my hair
was really short at the time and she did
it and then when it started to grow out
Tiffany started to braid my hair like
technique is used to do hers so Tanika
and our let are the people who started
the whole braid situation the way that
they look they did that then it kind of
fell into my lap so I'm gonna give
credit where credit's due
uh Britney Asia Tracy - uh Tamika I hope
I'm not forgetting anybody uh Velma oh
the other Tiffany I don't know I got the
only people I can remember I love all of
you guys if you guys are watching this
thank you I hope you guys are doing well
in life and but I am very happy that I
went I'm very happy that things turned
out the way that they were I want to
thank everybody that I went to school
with who helped me who got to know me
who just knew me as the crazy kid who
just was everywhere talking all the
time
thank you and I hope that you guys
enjoyed this so if you guys are thinking
about going to a school for hair or for
nails or for skin or for any of that
make sure that is something that you
really want to do because panhead am
alone back baby was a lot okay um I hope
you guys enjoyed this and I will catch
all them on next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
