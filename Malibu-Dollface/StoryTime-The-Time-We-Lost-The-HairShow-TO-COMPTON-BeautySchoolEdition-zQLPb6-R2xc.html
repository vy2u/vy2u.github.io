this is gonna be like I guess the beauty
school edition since you guys really
enjoyed my last one so sure I have a lot
of stories guys that was a very pivotal
time in my life and so this is the time
that we lost the hair show okay
okay so during school we all had you
know this creative book everybody wants
to do so damaged most of us didn't
really know much about nothing so they
told us that if you again are from LA
you know what the Hollywood Park Casino
is and if you know what the Oliver
casino is then you know how big it is
and they usually host events that whole
thing so they told us you know they're
having a hair show I don't know it was
Bronner brothers I'm not sure who was
the person behind that situation but I
was like okay cool I'm not doing it so
one of the girls that I was in school
with named Kim and Kim was the one who
taught me how to
silca Phi some hair how to lay leave um
Kim was dope she was one of the dopest
people there that went to school with us
so she was like would you mind being my
model I had this really dope idea would
you be my model and I'm like I didn't
want to do it because again I just
wasn't I wasn't ready to be in front of
people I wasn't ready for that so I told
her yeah reluctantly and I'm just kind
of like okay we'll see how far this goes
and if it starts to go into a good
direction that maybe out really
considering right now we in the
preliminaries so come to find out it was
a girl named latina that went there too
and Kim a latina were friends so latina
was doing it as well so she acts he goes
kyla to be her model so I'm like okay
well I'll be there with somebody that I
know it's a hair show it's not a dance
competition in Sai any of that so I
should be fine
right no so we get there our instructor
takes us to the back he tells us all the
rules about what is going to be I'm not
really paying much attention I'm gonna
sidekick I'm on
with some little cutie I don't know and
she pretty much this was the first time
I ever seen somebody take some white
hair or some 6:13 hair put some color on
it and make something out of it so Kim
was like I want to do this very
out-of-the-box type of thing I'm gonna
do some flat twist ease in the front if
you don't know what flat twist these are
Google them you know exactly what they
are they may have a different name from
where you come from but it's all the
same so she was like I'm gonna do some
flat twist ease on a wig my no closure
no fronts were none of that at the time
owned just she did
twisty my twisty and then I want it to
be red and then I wanted to be long in
the back like to my thighs in the back
and then I want to get the city of
Inglewood spray painted on it and I was
like okay different cool you know again
I'm looking up to her so I'm like you
know whatever she gonna do she gonna
kill it I don't see a problem and uh
latina was like I wanna do a green
situation with keylolo
so mind you I told you guys that Kyla is
from Texas okay and she's one of those
people that talked like I said it taught
me how to do a quick weave show me how
to do a lot so she came to school with a
lot of knowledge so about her Hollywood
hair which is pack hair like the company
Hollywood hair they sponsored the event
so we got all of his hair for free to
use okay we had to go all the way out
somewhere to pick some hair up that was
just another reason for us to be getting
our hours and we really ain't in school
we everywhere but where we should have
been but no hater there we get back to
the school they do the color and Kylie
was just kind of like I don't feel like
latina is gonna do me right like I feel
like she was like I want it to be Kim's
model and Kim was like whoa I picked you
to be my model because you know you cool
whatever and I would have picked Kylie
but at the time collar was just having a
lot of growing pains going on in school
at that time so
she was like I just kind of don't want
to do with that and she has a big
personality and everybody can't deal
with a person with a big personality
which was understandable and I believe
that kind of got that so somehow someway
in the midst of us doing all of this one
of Carla's good friends in the girl that
one of the girls I went to a junior high
school with Asia got into our group so
it's me Colin Asia as models and then
there's a Latina and Kim as spies okay
Kyla was like I just feel like she gonna
do me wrong she's gonna do me wrong she
gonna do me wrong Kim had literally took
everything that she could and put into
this way so much so that my hair was
ready she know that I like Chucky and I
ended up getting a rhinestone shirt that
I still have to this very day where
Chucky on the front with a knife and
then he got these rhinestones on his
teeth like a grill it was a great idea
in retrospect but baby it's just so
wasn't it so that was that was that was
my get up so Kylie came up with this
idea to do it would look like a
helicopter on Asia's head and the day of
the show we I think it was on a Sunday
because we went to school from Tuesday
to Saturday so yeah it had to be on a
Sunday so we were at the school getting
ready because nobody was there and this
was like early in the morning nobody was
there we had to be there I think the
show went on at 5:00 we had to be there
and check in by at least one and then
had like kind of prepping get ready okay
so at this point it's been about three
weeks so about a month since they were
working on the hair so we don't I don't
have any say-so in the hair that I wore
it was just can you balance the hair on
your head because it's heavy that was
kind of the thing I'm like I got it okay
so as far as a tire went what we were
gonna wear this is where I'm real hood
so we came up with the bright idea let's
all wear Dickies so I have on that's
just visual here before we even leave
the school and get to that mess
um I have on a red wig these pictures
are gonna come to haunt me some someday
I promise you they are because people
got pictures and video um I have on this
red wig rhinestones um all through the
front I have the city of Inglewood on
the back in a white spray paint mind you
I have one red DP shorts a Chucky shirt
with the ice-out grill I have on the
Dickey the cuz you know Biggie's they
sell them at tops and bottoms too so she
ended up giving me whoa I think I had it
actually which was like the Dickey the
Schwartz leave workers button up so that
was on top of the Chucky then I had on
some sums I'm sure I'm almost certain it
with some red chucks then Asia come so
Asia has won the helicopter hair which I
believe was like a teal and a blue and
she hasn't want some blue Dickies she
got on a crop top she got on uh
we call him scrunchie socks slouch socks
but you know the dicks the ad socks she
got on some of those with some J's
keylolo I do not remember what kind of
war I don't remember what her outfit
attire was it but it definitely was
Dickey so they probably was either black
or blue of some sorts I don't believe
they were green because her hair was
green so we were at school and latinas
putting colors wiggling for the first
time and modules been three weeks since
the situation and you can see in college
face she just like I knew that this was
going to happen I knew she was gonna do
me dirty and do me some pretty much some
 at the ninth hour so she was
just like I'm so over this she's I feel
like a green goblin so and it
wasn't cute it was like just green wavy
hair to the back with rhinestones and
she riding someone's who her face worked
to her scalp it was just not a it
already started off for the bad so then
we had to get there now my jar school
was probably at the most like ten
minutes from the Hollywood Park
you know so I wrote Kim because of
course I was her model and keylolo
rolled with Asia and I have no clue how
I Tina got there
I really don't know so at the time Kyla
had a Mazda Miata so if you know what a
Mazda Miata you know how small it is so
she had a convertible on top of that so
I'm sure most of us who are listening to
this have seen the movie BAPS so keep
that in mind before I say this so she
pulls her top back they got one at the
time Rolex chains were all the rage the
stunner shades was all the rage Asia had
a pair in black and Lola had a pair and
cocaine white with just black out lenses
and we are rolling down Manchester and
you see we're at a light and legit it
looked like Halle Berry and her homegirl
and Babs could you just see colorful
hair College is blowing in a winner got
these shades on their own exchange they
got they uh.they bamboos on it's just a
hood and we are dying as we're going
down the street like this kid like this
can't be like right now this so we get
there and there are rules that we were
told like specifically that we could not
break we could only have up to I believe
six people in our group so it was Kimmy
latina me Hilo on Asia so that was five
and we couldn't find another person to
be in a room in Asia somehow got in the
group I don't know but thank God she did
um and we get there and the rule was you
could not have anybody that was not a
student of your school in your in your
program well wing it there and Compton
hair school is their girl they got a
nice little Mowgli a nice Lion King
theme you got little kids on with fur
bottoms and iced out chains and chokers
and whips and chains and and we
like are you serious
they told us that we could not like
anybody so we get there and mind you I
don't know why I told them I don't think
it's the brightest idea for us to get
dressed now and go in our attire you
know you have like 2-3 hours to kind of
spare I don't want people to see what I
got only before I hit the stage no we're
gonna go dressed up to kinda their thing
was we go show them bitches bitch we
gonna win that's that was their whole
thing let me go go in head the tote this
is what we bring in so we get there
we're sitting and we're sitting and
we're sitting so we all have this one
Bikram all of the schools have this one
big room that we have to go in and you
get dressed in your collected corners
okay we go on the show started at this
point we have one of our instructors is
there a couple of my friends came a
couple their friends came Oh Kim latinas
daughter came her mom came Kim's son
came her husband at the time came it was
a lot of people who you know showed up
and some of our schoolmates came to yeah
how about that so it's time for us to go
up and somebody stole a Tina's
flip-flops so now we're around here
trying to figure out who is thirsty
enough to steal some flip-flops she got
drunk before we went and as she's been
there the whole time she had been
drinking so she they have to go onstage
with us you know saying like we have we
have a routine Lord so at the time yung
Joc song it's going down was the hottest
song around so they decide we gonna use
that and at the time being a pimp was
hot too so they was like we gonna come
out in our we're gonna come out and our
fur jackets with our pimp cups at the
end which are so I'm like okay we came
up with I will say I will be honest
about it
one of the hardest routines ever we are
its a mix of drill team hood dancing
twerking and and everything so we go up
there we are ready
don't want to start so I mean like at
this point I just wanted to give up like
we're gonna so lose him son and I forgot
who else who the other young man was
they came out they had our banner our
music starts and the begins we
get out there we're trying our best to
you know people cheer for us because our
hair wasn't bad at all it was the
production and we get out there so we're
doing our share we clapping it drilling
it up we hit the floor it was you know I
don't know how we ended up sitting
before we did anybody have those moments
where your adrenaline is pumping real
hard cuz you kind of work through hard
for this so they thought it was over
because there was a big gap in our music
which was another issue so I guess
because I just didn't want to lose in
the middle of that I got up why people
was clapping I was a big fish in yeah it
was it wasn't something that I had
planned to do I didn't know I was gonna
do that with just like everything I felt
and that moment came out and keylolo an
Asia are still on the floor mind you
keylolo was like oh so aggressive it was
just it was a lie for some some little
inner-city kids from the hood so um we
get off stage we all pull our wigs off
but we all are just over it like I can't
like my head was hurt and it was just a
lot of heavy shoes about four packs of
hair plus I got rhinestones it's just a
lot and my instructor was like how do
you feel like you did I said we lost we
lost now they come up and the next
person comes up which is Compton and
shoutout to Compton cuz ya'll do you do
that cuz y'all it up and they got
the little kids out there the bitch come
out as a tree and
just sitting there like oh yeah y'all
really thought y'all through honey
y'all have no good songs available hmm
so they come out they do
I didn't really watch too many people
after that it was a cool I think
somebody like did like cats or something
it's been so long um just look mm like
three I mean no it was 2006 was just
like okay so I'm looking at everybody
else's situation we stay for the judging
we knew we lost we didn't know he wasn't
gonna place okay when they caught all
the names and we didn't get our names I
said are you serious so
Tiffany who used to braid my hair she
came and at the time she was swear to
this day that I was crying cuz I didn't
win no I had a headache I did not cry
and on top of that they were giving out
these really cute blow dryers from red
you know like the red company and I
wanted is the red one like it was like a
ray of frosty see it was so Bob and
somebody else wanted and got our school
