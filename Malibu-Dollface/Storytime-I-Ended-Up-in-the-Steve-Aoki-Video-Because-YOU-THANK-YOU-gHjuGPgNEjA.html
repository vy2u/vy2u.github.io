let's talk you know we don't do a story
time I know it's a background you
should've just let go
anyway um and I would entitle this story
time how I ended up in a Steve Aoki
video is because y'all foes thank you
okay so about we did the video I think
in March um
so somewhere March um Sean Ross the
model who's actually in the video with
me and just an FYI the third part came
out today uh and I think the next
production comes out tomorrow so y'all
want to see what happened let me get Oh
Larry Lucy um make sure you guys watch
um but anyway I was I might have my
business or my Instagram and I just
happen to get online and I had all of
these acts there was no message it was
just a whole bunch of act and Sean Ross
had posted I'm doing a video and I need
to find somebody um where it's a girl I
mean a guy who can play a girl and a guy
and so many of you guys tagged me
so I jokingly put like if I could do it
then thinking anything would come from
it I was like you know every time
somebody is trying to be dope but I
don't know what it's for the next
morning I wake up I have two DMS from I
believe the producer and I have an email
from the executive producer and she just
said you know we have all these influx
of people who thought you would be
perfect for this part we looked you out
we think you're amazing of the director
thinks you're his top pick for what he
wants to do with this project
are you interested are you even in LA
I'm like I am yay
you know um and we talked for a little
bit via email we set up a meeting I went
down there I'm downtown LA to meet them
and it was just great
oh the young lady who plays uh Mary her
real name is Madeleine she was there and
I got to meet her I got to meet the
producer and a director and up top it
was just cuz I had a fitting so I'd
already said I was going to do it I had
a fitting I was still nervous I didn't
really know what it was for or who it
was for
um when I spoke to her about it she was
pretty much telling me you know this is
more of a low-budget video because um
it's just something for a project like a
more of a passion project for an artist
I didn't act who the artist was I she
sent me the the call sheet and said then
back on about it know what that man um
Steve Aoki is a huge producer around the
entire world
um he's known he everywhere he's played
with everyone
um and still I didn't know so uh they
didn't say anything to me about when I
went to my fitting who was four at that
time so I was telling her she was like
you know this is the pay for it are you
interested is it universe and do you you
know what do you say to that and I was
like I'm really more interested in the
opportunity more so than the money
because I just you know I really like to
act is something I find fun and
interesting and I really want to do more
of so I was like this would be just
something fun I can you know tell you
guys you go look that up that I was in
um because you guys enjoy scream clean
so much and just all this different
stuff so it was just more so just for me
to have fun so then I called Jenai my
sister and I said you know um I asked
him about makeup cuz you know I'm very
picky about my hair and I'm very picky
about my makeup and little money or no
my face so a Carter sheen on my face
like a book and she I was like do you
want to try makeup for this video I
don't know I mean they're paying me but
they already have a makeup girl I've
never met her I don't know you know
sometimes when you go to sort of things
because we are african-american um and
there's iliyan other things sometimes
people are the the matching of the the
foundation is very hard and you okay you
look a little ghostly depending on who
doing your makeup so just so I don't you
know I don't wanna look crazy so she's
like yeah I'll do it
um I got paid she like knows like I'll
pay you just come with me and it's also
for me to have somebody so I'm just kind
of not there by myself the only person
that I knew was in the video at the time
was Sean that was the only because he
posted it so I'm just kind of like okay
so we get there the first day of the
shoot we get there we go to downtown LA
we look all the
to make up all of this stuff we get up
there we need Shawn everything is cool
we're sitting on the couch and she's
like yeah I'm just calling some extra
tomorrow for the club scene and give me
a second and then you're gonna go change
and they had like my entire wardrobe
there she's on the phone and she's like
hey this is some song when I'm calling
to confirm that you'll be coming
tomorrow as an actually for the Steve
Aoki video Jen I was like do you know
who this is for and I was like mm-hmm so
I googled him while I was sitting there
and I was like I said she said it was a
little budge and she said well his
budget in our budget so went low budget
okay our low budget is no budget so Oh
like okay so then it kind of I felt like
okay this is a real moment right now
like this is real different
so we said there we spoke to her he
actually came um while I was shooting uh
downstairs are we shot um in downtown so
we were shooting in one building so we
shot down I'm downstairs so I seen him
like briefly and I was like okay so me
and Shawn spoke and we kind of got to
know each other and I spoke to the other
young man who actually played trebs his
episode is out today well his pieces out
today um and you'll see how all of the
three of us link up okay but I'll have
you know it was crazy about this
situation was I always will I literally
just said like the week before you're
not gonna play a bad bitch in something
like I just want to go and just just
 the up look the way these
blessings is set up lord oh my god you
just you favor me too much I'm worthy so
you know I was just kind of like this is
crazy like I'm really playing in a bad
bitch in a situation in which I see the
end okay so um I was just like this is
crazy so I had I mean like literally
every single person that was there was
super nice to me from the producer of
the director the system director the
cameraman the bundu everybody was super
duper night
now y'all are gay right okay so yeah
um usually it's uncomfortable for me to
go and do a lot of things because people
don't know how to take me because they
don't know me so they kind of treat me
where something I says is bad
necessarily but they don't when you
don't know a person or how they're gonna
react to something you kind of tiptoe
around what not to say should I say she
should say he like you know say is that
type she asked me off the RIP and I'll
just say ya know I'm playing Larry and
Lucy you got me if I'm in loosing you
you can call me her own you know it's
I'm not offended by it but I was happy
that she took the time to say what she
said which was I want to understand who
you are as a person because I do not
wanna thing cuz that's none of our you
know what we're doing so we shot the
first day I was wearing um I was wearing
this long dress um and I had so many
options for wardrobe and that long dress
was the one that they wanted to go to
because it was very form-fitting as you
guys seen the video um but also I had
some so Kate that I actually brought
before the shoot because um it looked
like a lot of the shoes that they were
trying to give me we're more like boots
um and that just wasn't gonna work so I
was like okay I'm just gonna go buy some
just dope Louboutins just to have in my
closet so whenever I feel and sexy I can
throw them on okay well you nobody told
me that Christian and so Kate are so
petty so my feet were killing me
so we have a scene that it's coming up
what I love you and you know what I'm
talking about when you see it um and
we're all walking together and I'm
trying to get on the good foot cuz it's
real rough in these streets um the
situation under a lot of people were
asking me like did they ask you to take
off your way did you just volunteer um
the director came up with that why we
were there and he said would you mind
doing Elsa no I've been on camera with
no wig before I got hell okay it's a
nice little beehive Abunda here so I'm
cool if you wanna
as I got out with that because it was a
reveal um for the character you know and
a lot of times when you do things it may
not be something that she will
personally do but for the betterment of
the project you got to bite the bullet
sometimes so I picked the bullet I was
cool with the bullet airman so the next
day was the second day and that was the
the makeout scene and it was it was not
in downtown me we were still in downtown
actually it was just in a different
place um it was a little further almost
out of downtown and I think it was like
an old mental hospital that we shot in
and what's crazy is I didn't know any of
the extras were there because they had a
separated because we were shooting
before they got there so we might wade
through one area went around another
area and it's all these people I'm like
no I mean I got some stashed over here
like okay um but myself Sean his friend
Karen I caught her me two young men who
played tres and Sean's boyfriend all of
us were just kidding July we were all
kicking it between scenes and having a
good time and getting to know people it
was just fun it was like a great
atmosphere everybody was there to work
but we also were there to have fun and
even the crew that you know the Wardrobe
lady I forget her name I think her name
is Stephanie but she was the homey I
love you 70 of you punching it cuz she
made sure that I was comfortable I had
these bracelets that I had to put on
every day
and I remember after the third day my
all this was sore because I they were so
tight and we had we had the charisma you
know it was kind of nudie problem so if
I didn't wear them on one day you would
see what looked like we shot this on the
three days so um that day was just um
that the makeout scene in the bathroom
which I don't know who the man is I mean
his name I think his razor
he's like a wrestler ibly um but yeah
yeah so they have like I didn't get to
meet him prior to that it was like hey
this is him you guys go in the bathroom
I'm home so yeah it was cool then we
have the upstairs scene which meet which
was me and
two dudes um and two of those gentlemen
I actually met they were extras and we
were just talking cuz I just feel like
I've been an extra before and stuff so I
feel I don't need to talk to everybody I
didn't want nobody to feel like I'm the
store and y'all stay over there no it
was like let's all talk we losing any
when we leave you a real thing so we got
to know each other and it wasn't like
the atmosphere wasn't like that anyway
um but one of the guys who is mr. Jay
Flores is currently on Big Brother that
is airing right now so he doesn't know
any of this is going on anything is
coming up as he's in the house um let's
see a third day um was the last day
which at this point means and I was very
tired because our call times were like
like 12:00 and afternoon and I do not
get up into like 3:30 and afternoon so
that was rough and we were not finishing
until I midnight so yeah it was a little
rough on us so the third day was just
what the second day was also the club
scene where I was waiting it was me
meda and we was getting bumping grinding
on the dance floor but um don't mind my
phone um but yeah it was definitely one
of those things where it was such a
great environment you didn't want to go
home but you had to go home because you
had to come back the next day but she
was really tired so the third day was um
our last shots which was the limo shots
we were outside in the cold I wish it
was cold now I'm in the cold for so long
and nearly young lady Madeline
we really didn't talk for like the first
two days it's because she was coming in
at different times I was shooting at
different time so it was say hi to each
other but we didn't get a chance to like
like bond or Bob or even know each other
name so when they were doing and said
all summer for the limo and all of the
people going into the club we were
having a um I guess you could say a
sister for a moment about how our feet
hurt because she had one these heels and
you know and we were just joking like
how did my character get there did he
take an uber because she gets out the
limo but I just woke up so I was like
okay and it was a joke about the purse
I'm like I just hate this geometric as
purse I wouldn't worry what I did is
that about
me I lose the in real life so it was a
great experience and I just want to
personally thank all of you who have
