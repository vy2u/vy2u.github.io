first shot at story time and I have a
little special guest which is little
Richie Rich and he was sleep but I
wanted somebody deal with me because the
Noddy don't want to play with me cuz she
just don't rush it so boom so anyway
this is going to be titled
the time I accidentally met monitoring
so you guys know I'm sure you may not
know that I am a huge fan of Lana Del
Rey um and this is the only time that
I've had to meet her being the fact that
I'm from LA I live in LA like but I've
never been to a concert or anything
because either she sold out or is too
expensive and when I say to expenses on
me like $2,000 expensive like I can do
it but I'm not gonna do that a lot of
you guys were also asking me about the
tattoo that I have right here that says
original and I got the placement from
Lana Del Rey because she has one on each
hand one says trust no one the other one
says paradise so a lot of people were
asking me like oh I really like your
tattoo and that type soon matches this
one here that says life as plastic is
fantastic anyway um so I haven't really
had a chance to meet her I love her to
death I got all the unreleased songs
from serial killers all the way down to
ride in with ASAP Rocky my Jam's
so I love her to death I have all the
albums everything so one particular day
you guys may not know this neither I'm
one of those people who don't smoke or
drink and when I say I don't drink I
mean I don't drink on a regular I drink
socially like if I go to the club or
something out drink um if I'm you know
at a party or something like that I'll
drink but it's not really I just don't
be like oh I had a long day the meal get
some wine like that's just really not me
um and I don't smoke period but it does
what you do you know sure business but
anyway so I kept all contemplating if I
was gonna go to walk and if I wasn't
gonna walk or you know say hey we just
back before so I'm just gonna go ahead
and go cuz I was like this close to not
going now I'm not gonna mention the area
that it's in because I know it's a lot
of crazy people out here I don't wanna I
think her parents may live in the area
so I don't want nobody I'm in today so
anyway um I'm walking on the phone and I
one of those people that I find things
like walking especially in really nice
neighborhoods I find it very therapeutic
for myself because it allows me to kind
of see what's tangible in my life and
I've done this a lot and you know when
you speak it into existence and I feel
like you work towards hard towards it
things end up happening um in your favor
so you know I tend to do that a whole
lot and I'm walking and it's so many
ways to go to get to one area in this
particular area so I used to take all
types of routes to just go here there
there and there so I'm walking and I'm
coming down the hill and this is a
residential area so there are four air
people walking their dogs you know it's
just everybody's out so I'm not really
paying much attention because I again
I'm on the phone not paying my bill
whatever some longer so I'm coming down
the hill and I see a young woman and it
was a guy older gentleman walking
towards me so I'm coming down this hill
still on the phone I'm just a little and
I see earlier that day I seen a picture
of Lana Del Rey head I don't know what
it is but she has a net for wearing like
powder blue t-shirts and I seen her in
so many like she just loved para blue
t-shirt so I've seen a picture and she's
like and it was a um I think she was
somewhere with our family's paparazzi
pictures I got her or whatever so I'm
still looking like this is no no Lana
don't worry please
not this past Christmas but the
Christmas before last there was um a
picture that she had posted of her
family and I was like this house looked
like it would be in this particular area
but never thought much of it I just said
it and then that was what it was so
they're walking towards me and she I see
that the young woman has a cigarette
Lana likes to smoke and I see that her
head is down and I'm like she got dark
hair I'm just like this is not about to
be who I think it is and she looks up
and is this indeed Lana Del Rey now mind
you I'm on the phone
I don't hear nothing that this person is
telling me right now I'm like my heart
start beating now you guys know I do not
fan out for anybody the only person that
I would probably fan out for
now would be alia and obviously Garros
or so I could never do that
so there's not any other celebrities
besides on the right that I would get
this exciting for so I'm just so the
person is on the phone talking to me and
they did it it it I'm like anyway I was
like oh my god Ilana like and then she
was like hi and she was so sweet she was
like how are you and I was like I'm good
I was like can I just say and I was
about to where y'all just I got this
Lana Del Rey t-shirt it's the cover of
paradise and I was gonna wear it that
day I'm happy I didn't consume like you
must be stalking me and I was holding up
days um I was like I just wanna say I'm
a huge fan I love you can I have a
selfie and she kindly said no and I know
the reason why she said no because when
I think we just what a lot of y'all in
public I see the remember like that was
the worst angle possible uh and then she
had been in the media a little bit
because she had gained a little bit of
weight so they kept on saying how should
expect when she takes pictures with her
fans and all of this other stuff and she
wasn't wearing any makeup neither so
again she's probably just taking a
casual walk with her dad she's not
worried about anybody else and I can
respect that and I think if it was the
shoes on the other foot and I didn't do
this I don't think I would have got it
but I totally get it like this is my day
off she could have been a bitch she was
totally not that she was super sweet she
was like thank you so much I told her I
said your daughter is an amazing and he
was just he smiled super sweet super
nice and they kept on walking and I'm on
the phone a person I get that they still
talking and I'm like Jacque just
met my god favorite singers ever and he
was like yeah did you know what I said
I'm like no so that was just like my
heart was just do do do do so to this
day I still look at that spot when I go
walking to this day and remember that
and was like I haven't been able to go
to a concert but at least I got to meet
her and that is like the best thing ever
um so Lana if you see this I did meet
you that day with your dad I'm not gonna
say where it is because I'm those crazy
folks in the world but I want to say
thank you personally because you were
very sweet you were very nice you didn't
have to acknowledge me you were totally
off the clock and you were SuperDuper so
she was
we did ever and yeah I want to say thank
you Lana but that was a very very
positive experience because he is some
celebrities until you I used to love I
met him and I'm like I know who said
that quote what famous singer now said
that quote Ritchie you know you don't
care huh yeah I bet
so I'm yeah that was my first edition of
story time I hope you guys enjoyed this
