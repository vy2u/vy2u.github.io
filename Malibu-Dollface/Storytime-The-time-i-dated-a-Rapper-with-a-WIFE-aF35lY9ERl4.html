with the videos this is going to be a
story time which I don't do and I know
you guys don't like when I do story
times up against a backdrop but however
I am knocking several videos out at once
so you ain't got much of a choice so
anyway this video is going to be
entitled the time I dated a rapper that
had a wife I usually you guys know I do
not like my relationships and if I do I
reference them but I don't talk about
specific people and we're not going to
start now because I don't want to get
sued but we'll go back to I think I was
about 19 or 20 and I was in Hollywood
going to parties I had no business being
it making friends and just having a good
time just being young and fun and at the
time this particular rapper was one of
the hottest rappers that were out at the
time and he was cool and everybody loved
him and I happened to be at a friend's
party and he approached me and asked me
you know all these questions now around
this time I was single ready to mingle
acting stupid and didn't really see
anything wrong with it because again you
believe what people tell you whoa
we get to pretty much dating at this
particular point so we're going out of
course we're not going out in the
daytime of course we're not going out to
no events together I'm there at the
event but I'm definitely part of the
entourage and not part of that okay no
show this went on for about for I want
to say about four months and at the time
he I went I remember specifically he
would have to go to New York for some
appearance on some late night show so
I'm not gonna give you guys you guys
know how old I am y'all know a year this
is but I'm not going to give you guys
years and points because people like to
connect dots but anyway I remember him
going to New York and we had had a
falling-out before he left because
someone that I used today kept calling
me and that whole thing
so he was pissed off about that which is
quite funny we had got into it and
during this time I just I was literally
like fresh out of beauty school just
in life and having fun I didn't really
have any direction in which goals I
planted to go or being or it was nothing
like that I just wanted to have fun I
just wanted to be out in the limelight I
just wanted to be able my friends and
have a good time and that's pretty much
what it was so it started to fill those
turn away towards me and at the time I
really didn't feel the same way I just
thought it was cool and who doesn't want
to date a rapper and I'm saying like
that's how you feel like who don't want
to do a rapper but you know if
the funny thing about it is that during
this time his entourage was very aware
of what was going on um I however did
not do my homework to know that he
actually had he was engaged um and I
didn't know that so apparently the
engagement was on hold during the time
that I met him that's why I guess it was
never brought up to me I really didn't
care at the time about what was what but
I didn't know if he would have told me
it would have been a different situation
because again I'm just not that type of
person even at 19 having fun I just
didn't feel that it was this just it's
not that deep but he didn't say anything
so while he was in New York and he was
doing his appearance on that particular
show that he was on they asked him about
the union that would have eventually
come forth and I was like wait what and
he was like yeah you know we are get
you're engaged and he was like yeah I'm
happy in and like it's great and she's
amazing and all his stuff and literally
I was flabbergasted like you say whoo
late again I had somebody who just
wouldn't leave me alone and I felt in
the moment in which he did that he was
trying to get back at me so I took it as
literally like all right he's just mad
so he's going to say this on TV because
he's mad at me and um I remember him
texting me saying make sure you watch
tonight and that kind of was it because
we were not talking like we were really
on some unfuck with you right now um so
I was just kind of like okay and really
honestly at the time is I was still in
love with my ex-boyfriend at the time so
it I didn't feel as if they
situation was going to be anything
serious because the way in which we were
living it wasn't serious it was at night
I'm part of this
I'm the hair stylist I'm this these are
the things that I just didn't see as a
real relationship so when you do start
today somebody who's in the limelight
and they have this big situation long on
you do start to feel kind of like the
help after a while because you're going
to always be labeled as the friend
you're never going to be able to walk
that red carpet
unless he's ready to do that and he's
not about to commit career suicide at
the time for me just didn't work so I
just thought it was just me having fun
and me being cool and he was taking a
little more seriously than I would have
liked to take it so that's kind of the
source without getting too much into it
that kind of was the source of the
argument aside from my ex-boyfriend it
was kind of like you're not taking me
seriously and I'm serious about you and
this is this is that and I'm just like I
you're cool I care about you but I'm not
there and at 19:20 I was not there only
person I have been with was my boyfriend
at the time so it was very hard for me
to detach from him and then go to
someone else no matter who you were and
how much money that he comes back to LA
after his little appearance he's back in
LA for about a week at this particular
point and my friend I think I had a
psychic at the time if I'm not mistaken
I had like a psychic - or a psychic
three I remember which one it was the
flip though and I remember getting the
text message from her with a link saying
GLAAD told her what happened she was
only person who knew and I had told her
what happened and she sent me this like
it's he's really like getting married so
I remember calling him after that I sent
him the message and I called him right
after URI be so mad at somebody you send
it and before they can even read it you
call it to be like now what so that's
where it was with it and he was just
like like went off like how dare you ask
me how dare you question me how
dare you if you you got this nigga
texting you and all this you gonna ask
me about like and then I was a stranger
questioning him about his endeavors so I
definitely wasn't wrong for that
particular point because it was like I
just told him before he left that I
didn't want to be him like that because
I was kind of stealing something else
and for me to question him about that
even though it was bigger than that
because I we were just dating me and my
what my ex-boyfriend had never talked
about marriage we we were kids but he's
was much older than me not he we were
still in you know our whoa I was 1920 he
was closer to 30 at the time angles it's
rich so he went off on me I remember
seeing his fiancee act something and she
gave me this look as if she knew that
him and I had some type of relation to
had one noise like she looked at me like
you know they say I don't know but you
know they say some girls they know when
another woman has had their husband or
boyfriend because it's a look that they
give them that's kind of the look that
she gave me as if I know what's going on
but you're not gonna knock me off my
pedestal this is my lane you're never
going to be here but she said all this
to me with just by just looking at me
and I just felt like really like this is
how things run so I remember they had
ended up getting married and um I think
they did in a private ceremony or
something like that and they had been I
hadn't talked to him I stopped talking
to him like right after I had found out
so it was like I talked him one more
time after I seen her somewhere and it
would just our our friendship our
relationship they just kind of dissipate
it we just didn't talk to each other
then I ran into him at an event in
Hollywood at the ArcLight
and he was just so chatty you know and
it was like people around and he had
never been like that he was a you know I
see you changed your number which at the
time I had transition from a damn
sidekick to whatever the I have had
at that point I think I had a helio at
the time I don't know and he asked for
my number and I decline
I said I'm not worth nothing that
happened before it will be the situation
and my feelings were hurt because I felt
like I was getting to that place that
apparently he was at but it was weird
for me to feel like is it if he was
there at that place
how are you at that place with the
fiance so I don't understand it so I
never knew until it was told to me and
once that was told to me I was very just
like I don't I don't want to do this I
don't I don't I don't want no parts of
this because again I have a mom I have a
sister I have sisters I have you know
saying I don't want to be that person
and I always talk about people who are
like that but this is kind of the
situation when you're dating somebody
who's not ready to be themselves there
they're still trying to be who they are
for the next person so therefore they're
doing things to oblige and appease other
people and then it ends up leaving your
feelings and what could have probably
been something right for the two of you
kind of on a back burner because I was
like I'm not doing that and I remember
that blow-up that we had he pretty much
told me that I should just play my
position and shut the up and stay
in a child's place that's pretty much
what he told me um and knowing how I am
and especially then I I don't give a
 now but I really didn't give a
man I went at him so hard but again
never in a situation where I've dated
someone that was of stature or whatever
the situation is have I ever threatened
to expose who they are or what they do
because I always feel like that's
another step in the wrong direction if
you guys are not going to be cool
anymore just don't be cool anymore but
whatever you do in the dark is gonna
eventually come to light I'm just not
going to be the the person to bust the
door down and shine the light on what
you're doing that's not my position
there's this a lot so I definitely um I
learned my lesson and being so young it
was a easier lesson to learn then than
it is now
so that's why a lot of times if you guys
notice on Instagram and stuff like that
and I see people exposing people I think
it's wack because I have chances to do
that and I just always feel like it's
not
and again alia has a song called but
it's if you're the other person and you
don't know that you're the other person
in your relationship sometimes that's
how life kind of works sometimes because
everybody all parties involved are not
being honest and for me that was a
problem
there was no honesty going on and at the
time I really didn't care because my
heart was somewhere else
my body was somewhere else I just didn't
really it was like I'm was hey how you
doing yeah I'm saying so yeah that's
that's a note on that story but I felt
the need to share that because a lot of
people always ask me like who have you
ever do to Roper and it's like yeah I
dated a rapper and didn't know he was
about to get married
unfortunately so hope you guys enjoyed
this and I'll get you guys to my next
one Bruce</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
