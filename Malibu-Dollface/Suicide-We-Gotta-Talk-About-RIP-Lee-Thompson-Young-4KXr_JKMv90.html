want to point out I got a bump right
here so if you don't stare at the bump
okay
please don't do that because it's gonna
be really disrespectfully root if you do
do that throughout this entire video but
um I did want to come and talk about um
suicide because I think it's a topic
that we all myself included uh we don't
talk about and the reason what prompted
this video is because some of you may or
may not know but Lee Thompson young who
if you are from the 90s or uh I mean
wasn't the 90s but the early 2000s you
know it was a show on the Disney Channel
called the famous Joe Jackson and he
played jack and he was in Johnny tsunami
you know these are a lot of shows I mean
movies that I watched as a kid you know
and a teenager that is unfortunate that
somebody had such a bright future in
such a greenstick and I know I was on
Instagram and I posted the picture of me
and Lee together like a week and a half
ago and I found my friend had the full
version clad the cropped version so she
had the full version to her computer so
I posted on throwback Thursday but about
two weeks ago and um it was crazy that I
know I don't think I think it was just
past week probably I don't I don't know
it doesn't matter but um something just
made me want to post a picture because I
had it on my myspace and I think it
might be on my facebook I don't know but
for whatever reason you know I posted
the picture and this happens that I was
really weird um but basically what they
say it happened was um he had been sort
of depressed he's working on the show
right now that is very successful and he
was doing a very good job and you know
I'm saying nobody really seen any signs
that could could have led to where it is
now however usually that's when we hear
these cases that's usually what it is
nobody had any signs about it sometimes
but most of the time people are living
our life like they're happy and nothing
is wrong
um and I think that I hear people say
all the time that well if I had that
much money or behind this and I was
living my dream then I wouldn't you know
and I think people forget like they're
human like they're celebrities but
they're still human at the end of the
day and they go through stuff and you
know it's not a if you're depressed
there's not a dollar amount that can
make that depression go away like that's
there to stay and I think people forget
that depression is real that's a medical
issue that and I'm saying it's the same
difference in diabetes or high blood
pressure like it's not going anywhere
like you need treatment in order to
handle it because for most people it
never goes away
and I think that if especially now like
teens who are bullied online and they
commit suicide because they don't want
to live anymore you know we need to
start kind of looking at the example
that we said you know I'm saying the
things that we say online I mean we I
always say stupid stuff online but I've
never malicious to hurt somebody I'll be
disrespectful to be rude to them at all
it's just too you know same kind of let
them know why I stand in certain
situations but I would never belittle
somebody I'll put them out there to make
them feel like they're less of a person
because of how I may feel about them you
know my personal views are not always
meant to be on display on this channel I
do that but it's mostly celebrities
because they can take it well some of
them can take it you know but I'm never
meant to like I'm gonna beat somebody
down in order to make myself look better
that's never the situation but I think
that it's a sad situation it's been so
many suicides in the last it's been
suicides in general but in the last
probably a couple of months it's been on
a lot and I think life is kind of
getting the best of people at this point
and you know we're taught that life is
this beautiful thing that's such a gift
and everybody doesn't make it in you
know you really should appreciate what
you have which I'm sure most of us do
but at the same time it does not change
or negate the fact that it does get hard
and people think that the only struggle
is a financial struggle and honestly
it's so many other struggles in life
that we go through to deal with we
have to do with that people don't get it
like you have as much money in the world
and still be so unhappy with the way
that your life in the direction it's
going I know a lot of people who are
trust fund kids and they do stupid shit
because they've never had to work for a
dime in their life to get attention from
their mother then you have people who
haven't really had a lot but they have a
great strong Family Foundation and they
they love their family they love
everything about them they love life you
know and they may not have a bends in
Christian Louboutins and all these other
things but they're still happy you know
so I think people need to stop really
focusing on the fact that it's always
about money because it's not always
about money unfortunately today's youth
believes that money is the root of all
things great because they see your
favorite celebrity with this or they see
me with it or they see somebody else
with it and they want it and they think
that that's going to make them happy you
get it in in five minutes later you
don't hear it's like a child when they
get a new toy they like it for a second
and it's over so real happiness cannot
be brought that's just bottom line well
you can buy stuff to make you happy but
it doesn't mean that you're gonna be
happy and stay happy you know with you
if you're not happy in the inside it's
not a material thing in this world
that's gonna make you feel better about
that for the long term it may work for a
second but it's not gonna work forever
and to hear that he committed suicide he
had to be going through a lot in life to
leave he didn't leave a suicide note or
for my understanding last time I checked
they said he didn't and um you know it's
just he was cause it's crazy I remember
meeting him like it was yesterday he was
the sweetest guy and I'm not even just
saying that but you guys know if you
follow me from like the myspace days we
met pretty much every celebrity there is
to me at one point in time in my life
that's why I don't get starstruck at all
because I damn it damn near everybody
any mama um but he was the nicest and I
remember vividly he was very soft-spoken
you know and he didn't really um he
didn't say no I was I can't have a
picture he said yes I said I loved you
he said you I love you
I said on the family Jackson I wanted
you to be my boyfriend
he laughed but you know it's just to see
somebody and he was such full of life
now this was many years ago so I don't
know and what part you know I follow him
on Twitter for a little bit and he
didn't really tweet much so I unfollowed
him but um it's really sad to see
somebody with such promise you know go
out that way but then again we have we
as people have to understand and keep in
mind that you know everything that's
litter is in gold and people think that
Hollywood is the ultimate goal and
sometimes that's your worst demon you
know saying that they die quicker didn't
seem like we do um so it kind of kills
me that people kind of think that way
that you know people of celebrity status
can't go through certain things in life
such as struggles depression exhaustion
all day they still go through these
things you know and sometimes having
them the amount of Fame the amount of
money the amount of know-how the amount
of notoriety it makes it worse and it
makes it harder for them to cope with
little simple things just like when
Britney Spears had her situation in or
Lindsay Lohan had our situation is that
people wanted to so quick to call them
crazy and say that they they're crazy
even Amanda Bynes now Amanda you need to
get on this Wigan girl who's yours be
terrible but besides that I do want them
all to get better and for the most part
breathing's good Lindsay seems to be
coming to but Amanda just started and
you know I think what they tend to not
understand is a lot of these celebrities
who have grown up in the spotlight
especially as kids they've worked from
nine up until whatever and not to say
that every person turns out the same
because you look at mary-kate and Ashley
you look at Ethan Paris Hilton you know
I'm saying she's not the greatest
example but she is a great businesswoman
now and her negative eventually turned
into a positive such as the Kardashians
but when you have like Americain
actually who were small there were six
months when they
there are year older than I am now and
there are multi-billionaires so I think
that it's safe to say that it's it
starts with the foundation at home
because you look at a certain people
that even brandy her mother didn't play
those games you know I'm saying so it
really depends on how you're brought up
look at dina Lohan she liked to kick it
with Lindsey go out with her I heard
she's living with her boyfriends like
she's she's not a mother she's a friend
and I'm saying she's she's used she
wants to kick it with you but she
doesn't want to take on the motherly
responsibilities because a lot of these
moms wanted to be famous in their heyday
or they had a talent that didn't really
work out for them when they were going
broening up so it kind of it takes a
toll on the child but other times it's
just simply the person and their they
may be a very complex person who lived a
life that wasn't them for a very long
time and they come out they show you
know but you know if anybody if you see
anybody that has you know suicide
tendencies or they don't you know I'm
saying always as always ask my friends
you know how you're doing and I always
tell them that I love them because you
never know what tomorrow will bring and
I think it's very smart for us to um
just kind of keep that in mind you never
know where someone else's head is you
know we're not mind reader's we don't
know somebody can give you the fakest
biggest smile ever
and it could honestly be you know their
demise they cannot be here tomorrow you
know so it's always a it's always good
to ask how someone's doing because I
could make or break someone's day or
save someone's life you know sometimes
people just feel absolutely positively
alone and they have no one else to turn
to
you know people hit me up all the time
and I don't you know sometimes I'm busy
but I still try to reply you know unless
it's just some bullshit but if it's
really stuff that they feel strongly
about and they need help with I'm always
there I always try to be there as a
Linehan because I never know who I can
help you know and I don't do it to gain
brownie points for somebody or for
somebody to say well he helped me
through this I don't want a handout or a
badge of honor for a deed that I've done
I just want to be there for somebody who
doesn't have anyone else
do so you know shout out to Lee Thompson
young and his entire family you know
I'll be rest in peace and I hope that
you know this situation kind of teaches
us all that you never know what
someone's going through so it's always
very smart to you know keep that into
mind for sure because you know life is
what you make it and sometimes life can
get very hard and very life can be a
real big bitch at times I know firsthand
you know and I've had those moments
where I feel like I can't do it anymore
and I can't go forward anymore not that
I want to die but that I just I shut
down emotionally physically and just
mentally you know and sometimes people
don't know how to cope with that you
know my strength and your strength is
different for someone else's and vice
versa
so something that I may go through some
people can get through with no problems
and then they may go to something and I
I can't grasp how they got through it
you know so keep that in mind always put
yourself in someone else's shoes because
you know you can say what you you would
do but would you really do it if it was
presented to you would you be able to
handle the situation if need be
you know so I think that's the smartest
thing of all so definitely keep people
in mind and keep their feelings in mind
and you know don't be so quick to judge
because there's only one God and trust
me honey you're not it so keep that in
mind I hope you guys have a beautiful
Saturday no telling where you can get
this video and I'll talk to you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
