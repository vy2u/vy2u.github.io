like my hair I am trying something a
little different and you guys always say
that you always wear such long hair sure
no um and I don't think I've been this
daring about my hair since my total wig
that I just wore recently because you
know I had to keep it very nineties but
um let's get into this hair on this hair
is from a Aliexpress company called
supernova hair and I've had this hair
ever since November so I've been wearing
this hair on and off and no it did not
come short like this they sent me a um a
lace closure and they sent me four
bundles of I don't remember so sorry
about that
I do not remember what my original
lengths of hair were but they had to be
somewhere between a 16 and a 20 because
I remember cutting this I cut quite a
bit off so it probably was about here
and I chopped about this much off but I
did want to try something a little bit
different because my hair especially
with body weight cuz I don't know what
it is what I like express but everyone
was in Brazilian body weight over Brazil
you might even decide I can only do so
much with this so what I cut it so
before I go any further I hair the
original texture is not what I have
right now this is not the texture the
it's a little bit of the texture in it
but a lot of this is a warm curl that
has been pretty much brushed out I used
this wand which is my Remington one um
it's this particular wand
I brought about three months ago and I
wanted to try something a little bit
different I believe that this one is
smaller than my original black one that
I pretty much used to on all of my hair
this one seems a little bit smaller so
pretty much I just went I crowd
everything away from my face and I
brushed it out well I combed it out with
my finger combed it so I just combed it
all the way through I use a
most of this I from this bigger side for
the back and I use this smaller side for
the front and then it made this nice
little page boy look now having this
hair for so long I've had a chance to
really live with it and see my likes and
dislikes about it and what I do and I
don't like um off the bat the one thing
that I did not like about this hair is
that when I first received it it had
that beautiful body way s in it the
problem was after was Co washed and then
it was washed I had more of a frizzy um
s pattern so it was it seemed like the
strands just kind of got a little thick
and it kind of expanded so the hair
wasn't as um uniform as I would have
liked it to be so what I went ahead and
did when it was longer is I put some
conditioner in it I combed it out made
it nice and uniform once again and then
when I rinsed it out I pretty much
twirled it um around a flexi rod and
then I let it dry like that so when it
dry it dry back into its original s
pattern I've done this before but this
particular hair just did not want to
stay in that pattern and wanted to kind
of give me that wild um grizzly look um
that's not what I was going for so when
I cut it I brush it all out and I just
literally cut it straight across um
this size seems a little bit shorter
than this I only because my wig is a
tangle my closure is also a body way so
a body wave texture and it was very
nicely I feel um this is something for
you guys who just can't do long hair but
you want something very cute
I feel like this particular look with
the Hat which I'm not going to take off
because I'm under here it's real mess I
feel like this is a very unisex look I
feel like a girl caillois rock this look
but also a boy a rock this look too
depending on if you are a little
eccentric with your looks
the look that I got after I did the
whole arm wanded look
and it's a very blunt cut and that's
what kind of gives it the valium that it
has because it is just blunt I didn't
put any layers in it because I just
wanted this very just boom
there's nothing but short curls you know
and this is very cute I straightened
this hair one time and I only did half
of it because it just wouldn't stay
straight add a tendency to want to go
back which in hindsight is a good thing
because that means it's going to keep
its form but it really didn't because I
had to go back in kind of kind of
manipulating a little bit more than I
would have liked to but overall I got no
shedding um the little bit of shedding
that I did get is after I cut it of
course you're going to get a little
shedding because it just happens and I
did not put any color on it besides my
strand test that I do because I just
felt like I don't want this to be a
colorful wig I don't want it to be short
and then I got color on it too
I feel like a lot of times um it's just
a little too much when it's short and it
is color at it and then it's just it
looks a little everything just gets
muddled and I don't know that so like
the hair okay don't get me wrong I do
like to hear a whole lot it's just that
I just wish this is the first time I've
ever experienced my body wave not
staying body wave ish but I will say
this if it did stay body wave I don't
think I would have this particular look
I think I would have opted for maybe you
know like I would have cut it about here
so I wouldn't have made it so short but
because I was able to bust out the wand
and long curl it and it was great when I
did my friend test it actually I don't
know what it was in the hair or whatever
but it it lifted so quick um it was like
a good seven minutes and my hair was
almost as white as my shirt so I was
kind of like okay so this is a pure pure
pure pure hair and there was nothing and
it had no smells to it at all it was
very soft when I received it and I also
noticed that the color was a little bit
darker than a natural Brown it had more
of a 1b texture like it kind of matches
my hat more so than a lot of my other
hair
a lot of it comes very Brown especially
in the Sun it's like ridiculously brown
but this actually was something that I
thought was really cute when I did cut
it however I made sure that I cut the
back longer than the front because a lot
of times when people cut they'll cut all
the way around and then your hair be up
if you like and then it just kind of
looks like you got a mop one but if you
want a little bit of length but you know
it could have been a little bit longer
too but after I did it I was like well
can take that back and then I would I
didn't know how I was going to like it
or not but I really do enjoy it and you
guys know I'm trying to kind of get out
of my ways of long hair I'm trying to
find another option and I think I
actually found it but again this is
definitely um a unisex look this is very
Janelle Monae I feel um very you and
your man could do this look I don't know
if he would do the curls like such umm
but you can buy like some 16 inch hair
and in chop it I wouldn't necessarily
buy the hair I would buy it if I was
going to cut it
uh let's just say you wanted your hair
to be 14 inches but like this I'm
abiding at 16 and I will cut it and the
reason is because if you buy it in a 14
and then you cut it it's going to get
shorter so I would give leave myself a
little bit room for cutting so that way
no matter what you do it's still gonna
have a little bit of wiggle room to look
right and it's gonna move right so I
give supernovae a nice eight and a half
because the hair is actually really nice
I just don't know if it was just my
particular bundles because they seem to
be all the same that just didn't want to
kind of go back to the Brazilian body
where you shave and everybody seemed to
love another its first I'm so easy so if
you guys are interested in this hair
make sure you guys hit the link below
and I might actually sell this unit
because I actually made myself another
one so if you are interested in this
little short of Dubey wrap um put it
below and I'll let you guys know when my
wig sell is actually coming up because I
got a lot of wigs I gotta get rid of for
our movie so I'll catch y'all in the
next one put</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
