we've already stolen and I have my
country puppyhood I'll be wearing and
this dog
[Laughter]
[Laughter]
I know you're like oh you just came
through yes I did yes I did yes I did
girl I even went so far I got two nails
just because I had to make it a moment
so I hope you guys really enjoyed of my
intro um so a little backstory
my hair is from supernova on L Express
and i'ma tell y'all right now they get a
ten out of ten because this hair did not
come like this so we're going to talk so
I was watching I don't remember and I
just have the urge to one to do
something Cruella De Vil inspired and
then I realized that 102 Dalmatians was
actually owned so I watched it I don't
think I've ever watched it I've always
seen the preview from it but I've never
actually watched some movie so I watched
it and actually was very interesting
because Karelas
ii like the person was great but her
wardrobe in the second one was Hanks I
was thinking what did Colella deville
had a daughter she messed around with a
villain who happen to be black and in
her daughter love lo Kim kimberleigh
bazzill look at God so as you guys
remember in with the rain Kim had on a
Jionni's race shorts and this is
actually a skirt this is not show up and
she had a title shirt and then she had
this Chanel suspenders on so I had to go
and redo this look I added these quilted
gloves because they have little Chanel
feel to them to go with my hair and my
contacts are my silica Sol ichika i
think these are my lord i'll put them
below I don't remember I put them right
here I got this rinsed out me by the way
so to my hair so I have to urge to say I
want some black and white hair why not
so I got to here from supernova hair
which was back in I want to say December
I think so and and you guys know in a
recent video I had shown you guys this
hair and then I it was like that's what
we're going to do and then I knew I was
going to curl it wasn't going to stay
straight it is four bundles of 28 inches
okay and then of course I cut it because
it has little layers in it and then they
sent me a 20 inch frontal as well so all
of this was this color this is all the
uh-huh so this time is the original to
the Virgin side okay this is the process
guide so what I did was I took it I
bleached it one time one time and in
legit went from this to this and I was
shocked and this is when I started using
that quick blue bleach the first time I
was like oh my god is going to be so
crunchy I rinsed it it was super duper
some mood it was so soft after I rinse
it and I was waiting for like a super
deep condition so what I did was I have
this shampoo and conditioner from magic
hair company that I've been using and
I'm totally upset I'll show you guys use
these are the messenger companies smooth
perfection keratin shampoo and this is
the buzzes and it is what it looks like
and then this is the smooth rich
conditioner and as you can see it's
almost gone but I use these two just on
this hair alone and i'ma tell you right
now it's saved this hair because if the
hair itself and it's coming up yellow on
camera which I'm really upset about
because actually in person it looks more
of this color from like a grayish color
so when I went ahead and did was I
construct the entire wig and then I
split it I went ahead and was very
careful with the partying on this puppy
and I parted it all the way down here
too
middle separated everything I pinned one
side off and I only put bleach on one
side and I let the bleach sit for 40
minutes okay 40 minutes when the 40
minutes was up I rinsed it and I ended
up with discolor well I ended up with a
613 color then once the 613 colors
deposited I went and I went over it with
my I think it's like rustic or rougher
is this ankle I use for my gray hair I
put that shampoo on it I you know use my
purple shampoo I did that what didn't
what ended up happening was I did not
lather it off together so now my hair is
a little bit on the lavender side as
opposed to it all being blonde so it's
still 613 in here is still like a little
lavender then I got a little gray it's a
lot going on however it did actually
turned out with our curls it I really
did like it but what I would do
different next time is it because I'm
doing this again what I would do
different this time it up with you next
time is the fact that I would do this
with already pre treated 6:13 hair so if
I'm going to mix a wig I would just do
one side I'll just keep going from side
to side so I'll do have and you know a
1b and then do the half 6:13 house one
bc the only thing that you have to do
with do your frontal and your frontal
will be very simple to do but it would
just save you a lot of time it would
save you a lot of mistakes
it would saving you because what ended
up happening was I had to go back just
for the roots not all of the hair just
for the roots in the back to make sure
that where the West is so if the West is
here you can tell with these down arrows
but if this is the West then I had about
this much of new growth that we're still
black so I have to go back in three
bleach that so that everything would
still be one blond color on one side as
opposed to this eye so once I did that I
went ahead and curled it and I let these
flipsie rise that was in my hair in for
a whole week so these these ain't gonna
drop no time soon and then what I do
what my makeup is I did of course the
context I did a lot more braid up in
here I did my eyebrows jet-black
calm as you can see I want to do to look
a little bit more cartoonish like how
gorillas is but I still want to
you know wearable look it was a let's
just say was a party or something that
she was going to or you would just
wanted to do this for you know fun and
then we should do if you want to you can
just pull some blonde on this side and
pull some black on this side if you just
want to be different which I'm trying to
do that was a pure accident and then I
just when I took it out I just put it I
just grabbed it like this put some
hairspray and then BOOM so overall the
fact that I was able to bleach this hair
or twice technically um and I still got
this beautiful hair that is not crunchy
that skill curl still holds the curl is
amazing supernova hair they have been
very patient very respectful they let me
be creative you know what I'm saying and
a lot of times companies don't want you
to be creative don't do it this color
don't do it that color don't do this
don't do this in it's like how am I
supposed to show you guys what I can do
with something if they won't even let me
do it so they was like hey do what you
want as much time as you need let us
know and I want to thank them for that
because it gave me a chance to really
put this hair to the test and I can tell
you there's a lot of people that I
review for they're probably are great it
would be and we would be good but this
this it probably would have burnt in
shambles I would have said okay well
only have half of a head because the
other side fell off but um I did use the
quick blue bleach my L'Oreal I use that
and I use 40 volume developer in order
to lift his hair and effect that it
lifted and out I'm still shocked I am
still shocked
I remember little sister was like you
lying if I said I swear to you one
application and it came out just like
this like let me get a close-up you're
like yes okay it's still bouncy it still
moves it still has body it's not crunchy
it's not dry it's not over processed
it's perfect especially because I was
going for this particular look I wanted
something that was a wearable look but
it was still hip-hop it was still
something that you know it was
still me everybody knows Crayola and
what I did different from coil it with
this and I felt like a Carrillo had a
daughter and she was trying to like go
on with her mom's the legacy was just
saying she wanted to do like the house
with the seals crows heron usually white
on the side and black on this side so I
purposely put it as the opposite because
I feel like her daughter would be a bit
of a rebel she like I want to carry on
my mom's legacy but I don't want to do
it exactly like her I'm not exactly the
same whether that's different okay just
saying so if you guys are interested in
from here and supernova here and it
splatters very well if you guys seen in
that video the flow was crazy so it
definitely was actually get these
restaurants in so that every single
piece of hair would be bouncy when I
took it out and Beibei I took these out
it is now I think two o'clock in the
morning
Los Angeles time I took these out at two
o'clock in the afternoon yesterday and
my hair still looks like this and yes I
did go out
I wasn't painting like this so I wasn't
crazy um it was very like demure and
this is me pulling at it and you know
wearing it so good so if you guys like
this let me show you guys thumbs up this
video I'm trying to do more themed looks
in the month of April May in June I'll
have a lot more time to do more stuff
like this
so if you guys have any suggestions on
any character that I can kind of I'll
Enzo hybrids but it feels like a little
Kim acrylic azile so who else could I do
like I don't know like Barney let's see
like Barney and Missy I don't know what
that would look like but it sounds fun
right this is a finger wave of all so if
you guys are interested in this look in
and you want to know how I created this
look which was not very hard you guys
are interested in any of this look the
nails anything click them below because
I would like to do a video if you guys
are interested on how I created this
particular look and I will catch you
guys in my next one peace
