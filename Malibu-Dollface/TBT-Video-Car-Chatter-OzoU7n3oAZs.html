every right now I hate when black people
have like expensive cars but then they
be so busted on one side but what did
you do then we don't talk about alright
so let me talk about now talk about
friends who can't sing within they don't
know they can see and in a I think you
got the best vocals and then they tell
other people that they can sing mm-hmm
but she use our tongue and all that
she's autosampler talking fix your face
you Matt you know you is younger you
making me nervous
okay looking along both Macs okay so you
guys we're back back
look at this recorded this video we
really do we have to start over because
we were mighty first women sorry but
okay let's just make this quick so Mitch
this is not how you start from nine
minutes
what are you okay so the TLC movie we're
gonna go we're gonna start this yeah
okay yeah I don't know little mamas
playing last time cuz I can hear myself
so you ain't helping in my little mamas
playing left I just adores plenty rise
and keke palmer is playing chile and
Evan Ross is plan Dallas Austin
now what you feel about this conundrum
is what it is like TV primers a doctor
says she gonna kill it with Chile laughs
and she's gonna get down with it okay
okay little mama we all went to the
bowling alley in this bitch being a
bitch that she is decided she wanted to
be messy
now I had already decided I wonder when
I seen her I was gonna speak to her
because P y'all didn't say that I look
like a little mama sometimes which I'm
not really offended by doing the fact
that I'm like a dude and she's a woman
so she should be a little more offended
than me not nor here nor there so I win
next to her and I was kind of rude cuz I
didn't speak you know how you doing I
just said so we're gonna treat ears we
look alike and her reply was well I'm
beautiful beautiful and then she was
like well you know are you guys some and
I was like it's the bone structure
that's what it is just a bone structure
so this ho gon say oh the bastard see so
she was cool though she actually was
cool it was some other drama going on
bed and
No um I actually like little mama she's
actually a cool person from what I know
her to be she's actually like one of us
she's cool Shayna she better not be
extra you know I'm trying to full
herself but you know it is what the fuck
it is you know I'm good on that note
missing that's a big TLC family yeah
like I said in the video we just did you
know you and my backseat bitch remember
that okay anyway I think little mama
her personality fits her look to the fit
but our personality fits I'm more
concerned like I said before with Evan
Ross as Dallas Austin Evan raw that's
Dallas this dynasty announcing anyway
yeah I'm more concerned about Evan Ross
playing Dallas Austin because Dallas
Austin you know isn't fairly attractive
pull it off you know
come on who left the town in the poop
fucking ass which she said Joe what are
you gonna do make me go outside and get
a switch I beat them they all grown men
no okay okay so what are you gonna do
Mickey why don't you get us wishing you
could beat him too bad Joseph are we
thank you thank you
so get your life she gave me a cliche I
can't I just can't
okay Mustang it ain't all that and I've
gotta use auto-tune pitch correction is
all some other shit but I know I can't
sing but this is where she claims she
where she is like the next missy elliott
you are talented just not with the
singing anyway
fucking haters no too bad broken you
need to brush that off because I know no
one is she couldn't like okay get it she
did a while I hear the voice elevating I
don't like it you're making my back I
don't know backdoors bitch so you stuck
her back only hers machine cigarette she
back there mad
it's a mother for good no I'm actually
pretty happy about this movie like I
really want them to show like all of the
drama mmm I don't get fuck about the
music all right we already know about
that I got 65 million records oh so you
gonna lay back now you lay your ass down
sorry back to the subject at hand so
is it your show dingo I mean it might be
dark and shit is really in dark out here
now so yeah I mean geez they talkin shit
all the front of that broom girl I got
for you hey
that means Maggie she can't do that
