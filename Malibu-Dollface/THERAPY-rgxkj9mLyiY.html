do more videos here my closet for called
closet talk even though it's about to be
like 6:00 in the morning I wanted to
come and do this topic because I feel
like a lot of people are afraid to
either talk about it or you know
suggested or whatever the situation is
and that would be therapy and
unbeknownst to a lot of people myself I
have gone to therapy
I started going when I was 12 I had to
go it was a situation that happened with
me uh with my mom that the courts like
prompted me to go to therapy at the age
of 12 so I went from 12 up until I was
14 and at the time I just didn't see
what the point of it was like I was like
this is stupid
my grandmother was like you have to go
canoeing with Maya's new so you have to
go but what I will say is that like now
as an adult when you guys watch a lot of
videos that I've done about various
topics and the reason why I can sit back
and like give a clear head about these
fingers because I did go to therapy and
I understand that a lot of times in the
black community it is frowned upon to go
to someone or shrink and tell your
problems to because people feel like
well why would I go and let somebody
judge me for things that I've done in my
past or you know things that I may have
done period or whatever the situation is
but what you guys have to understand is
that but there if he does or what is
supposed to do is about to be able to
give you a clear head about things that
are deep-rooted that have either made
you be a certain way caused you to act a
certain way just a plethora of things
that are pretty much taking you away
from the the core of a person who you're
supposed to be and for me what was
happening
and the situation because I doesn't
become like was it like Milus it wasn't
anything sexual that happened it was
just it was a situation that I just had
to deal with and I'm better because of
it and I don't necessarily want to say
what it is just because it's personal
but I will say that what it did you is
it made me it made me appreciate what I
have now and but what it did do is it
scared me and it made me afraid of the
world it made me afraid to God in the
world so I I don't know if I ever said
this but I was home-schooled from the
second semester of ninth grade all the
way until I graduated I didn't go to a
traditional high school so um what is
happening was because I didn't go to a
traditional high school I became a bit
of a hermit and not because that I
didn't go anywhere because trust me a
bitch was out have you follow me on
MySpace you know I all I ever do was be
out but it was all I would only go from
a certain time to a certain time I would
only go with certain people I would only
go out with certain friends um I will
only go to certain things so for a long
time I had this very scare to conquer
the world of think about me that was
very unhealthy for me too for me to be
like that but what it did was it forced
me to take the world on head-on to make
me who the person I am today but a lot
of times what I think what happens is
people are afraid of being judged
because judgment comes with a mirror
that makes you look at yourself because
everything that a person says to you
doesn't necessarily have to be true but
if somebody comes to me and say I think
you're truly skinny I've heard that on
my life so it may be a trigger that may
cause me to still away for me to react
the sword and well usually I just cause
people are just because that's a like
body shaming of any sort whether you're
skinny larger you know it could be a
plethora of things because I have family
members who have crazy
you know issues with you know gout in
you know retaining too much water it
just depends on what it is and I have
also have family members who are
skinnier than me so it really just
depends on where you come from and which
you've been through but I think what
people have to understand that the great
thing that I found for therapy is that
it was no one telling me what I have to
do it was a person telling me here are
things here here's avenues and there's
no fork in the road here are all these
avenues that you could possibly take to
make yourself a better individual and I
think what you guys have to understand
is that as much as we may love the
people that were put in our lives
whether it be our friends our family our
significant others um our surrogate
families everybody doesn't know
everything and people will raise you to
the best of their abilities some people
know so much but the point is they want
they're supposed to be your guardian
until you're able to be the guardian of
yourself but a lot of times our parents
 us up and our our elders I will say
path this up because like for
instance my grandmother I love like if
we going to go on a tear it's like my
grandmother and then my mom and it's
because my mom was so young when she had
me and my sister that it was like having
an older sister as opposed to having a
mother figure because my grandmother was
also young she was still older so she's
my grandmother technically would be more
in tune to be my mom as opposed to my
actual mom so what ends up happening is
the things that my granny went through
in the 60s and then in the 70s and 80s
she's now telling me as a kid you know
who the Millenial those things don't
they don't work you know saying every
issue isn't exactly the same as it was
during that time for trying to adapt
that now doesn't necessarily work case
in point
when there was the big race world the
race wars that were going on those
things of a lot of people around that
time - like everybody who wasn't black
was the enemy but then you have now
we have every type of person and most of
us get along with one another that
rhetoric that is being repaired you know
repeated through you know generation
through generation it has an expiration
date but then you start to have that
attitude during this time it usually
starts to create issues and problems
with people um but back to my point um
even now as a person in this is
boisterous and is loud and ignorant if I
can be here on YouTube there's a lot of
stuff I don't like to do which is like
get to know new people if you've known
me for several years let's just say in
the last couple of years you and I have
gotten to know each other we probably
would have probably kicked it once or
twice because I'm a person who I'm very
finicky when it comes to people and
that's why you don't see me on a lot of
if anybody's YouTube channel you don't
really see me kickin it with anybody
from YouTube and it's not because I have
any personal issues with anyone you know
personally but in order to get to know
me personally I have to know you on a
personal level anything with YouTube is
that we only show this much of ourselves
so if you see a person and they're doing
something repetitively and it's
something that you personally don't
with they usually just distance yourself
from them because there's a lot of
people that I may have posted kick it
with or we just never got around to it
but then it also comes to play in I'm
very finicky towards new people so if
I'm starting to see things about you
already because I'm seeing you do
certain things that I don't like then
usually I just be like okay I'll see you
when I see you that type of thing you
know I got friends that I've been
knowing on YouTube for years that I've
never met in person just because I feel
like if we are really going to be
friends then it will happen you know but
I think the falsification of who you are
as an individual here on YouTube has
just gotten to the point where it's just
so stupid but in therapy I've had to
learn to open up to new ideas and new
opportunities and new things because I
was so you know dead set and driven on
one thing and it's like but why would
you just
you know make yourself only one thing
when we all as people can do multiple
things so if you're a person who's
contemplating going to therapy for
whatever reason whatever issues whatever
problems you may possibly have had in
your life do it and go in it with the
open mind and at first the first couple
of sessions you might not necessarily
get anything accomplished but you are
going and going is something that is a
step towards the right direction for me
like I told you at the age of twelve I
didn't want to go and talk to no man or
woman to tell them anything that I
personally was feeling but I was very
scared and I was very angry and I didn't
know why I had an idea but it was deep
rooted in what I thought it was so even
now I go I don't know it's often and I'm
going often as I used to but I
definitely still go and I think one of
the things that you will see a lot on
YouTube is a lot of youtubers have said
that they're depressed and that is a
real thing if not people just making
videos for click at least for me is a
real thing but it's because I kind of
because I we do do this and we do talk
to no one who's there you get used to
this but because we are YouTube remember
at home a lot or we do videos a lot and
you don't have any like only people that
are here with me are the dogs but it
becomes a very lonely life and I'm not
saying but I'm not a complaining by any
chance I like my life but sometimes you
do become depressed because your work
becomes your life and your life becomes
your work and sometimes you just need to
be like I just need a moment you know
I'm saying and when people want you to
do I want to see you do this and I want
to see you do that you get into into
this routine of trying to please
everybody and you end up the one who is
the most unhappy in it so that's what a
lot of times when you guys do see me and
I'm going for a minute that's what I'm
doing I'm trying to get my mental state
back because this can be a lot I've been
doing this for a long time and I know
when I start to have those moments where
I'm uninspired and I don't want to do it
anymore and I'm not like my headspace
isn't right but then I have all these
people coming at me I have all these
opportunities coming at me
and I'm just unhappy you don't sound
like I'm legit I happy like um a couple
of months ago there was lifetime reached
out to me about a show it was a
competition show hosted by Adriana Lima
and it's coming up I think it's coming
up with a new season it was a run at
right after Project Runway and they were
really like you know opportunity to work
with you and I just didn't want to do it
and it wasn't because of the opportunity
and I'm just saying like oh I'm too big
or I'm too good it's just that it didn't
speak to me at all like at all and that
right there sparked something in me
because I feel like these people are
calling you because of what you do which
is hey it was it was a it was like a
beauty type of competition thing um play
so much more than just hair you get what
I'm saying so what it did was it made me
just want to focus more on the
production of what I want to do that's
why I keep telling y'all have something
what a couple of things great coming up
because I kind of just took a break from
the reviews um even though I have them I
just wanted to just do more dough more
into what made me happy and therapy was
one of those things that taught me how
to do that when you are confused about
something you don't understand something
you need to sit back and figure out why
are you doing it and what is the reason
and if that reason is something that is
okay with you continue to do it and find
a different way to do it if it's not
then you need to figure out how to
change that so that you won't end up in
a situation where you're just like
low-key depressed and doing something
that you hate because the thing that
people don't get is that if I'm doing
something here on YouTube that I don't
like to do whether it be reviews whether
it be me of doing Love &amp;amp; Hip Hop reviews
talking about celebrities and I'm not
happy then this is the same thing as me
sitting back working at McDonald's or
working at Ross or working at a place
that I hate just to make a check you
give it up and like it's the same thing
different circumstance and I didn't work
this hard for me to just settle and I
felt like I was settling and what I was
doing
because I wasn't I was happy financially
but emotionally I wasn't happy you know
I'm saying and it was draining me to sit
back and do something that I couldn't be
as creative as I would like to I feel
creatively stifled which then led to me
feeling depressed because I felt like I
was stuck you know so definitely if you
guys are interested in going to a
therapist research to therapist in your
area it's not something that is bad I
know it's told to you especially if you
come from an urban community or
something or you know Spanish culture
that we don't tell people our business
you don't go back and tell nobody your
business but it's not telling your
business is for you to be able to get a
better understanding of this thing we
call life and there is no playbook for
how this thing called life is done and
that's the thing I think we we most
forget is that through life you have to
learn how to make it work for you and
there is no cookie cutter way for every
single person to actually do something
you give understanding you have to
figure out what works best for you and
then go from there so yeah like I said
therapy is completely okay you're not
crazy um but to a degree we all a little
bit nutty like I said our parents
us a lot of us love so in order to
understand where you come from and where
you're going you have to understand
yourself and I think a lot of people
today don't understand their self and
they don't understand where they come
from they are of their environment but
they don't understand their environment
so a lot of times when you're in a very
I guess you could say a very unhealthy
situation if nobody showing you a
different way of it then that unhealthy
seems healthy and that's not okay so I
hope this made sense I hope this can
help somebody and if you guys have any
questions about like when I win or when
I do go like kind of what the processes
please be I will answer every single
comment below um and yeah I want to
you guys and you're not crazy if you go
it's part of life and it's part of you
starting to take responsibility and take
care of yourself and your mental your
like your mental state part of taking
care of yourself so I hope you guys
