go through this pretty quick cuz you
guys kind of get the idea of it but this
is therefore like this obviously this
front so this closure y'all not having
were a closure in so long but this
closure is like it's basically to mimic
Kim Kardashian super long party and you
guys know when I do videos and I do hear
and stuff like that I talk about this so
they have a specific closure that's for
middle part I'm gonna wear it in the
side part but it just gonna look really
weird because I go straight back but I
wanted to show you guys that you can
achieve a very natural look with the
closure still and because they've made
this one specifically to be long then it
definitely shows you the versatility of
what you can do if you have a particular
client or you yourself are just not into
frontals like that you just need our
super long part without it being that
you know four by four frontal I mean
closure I haven't worked closure and so
long y'all it's not even funny so what I
did was I use this cap that they gave me
because I just wanted to use everything
in which they offered and with that it
came with this very mesh laces type of
cap which I will say that I'm kind of
mad that I used it because of the fact
that they're the actual cap has like
these little padding is but it looks
like it's like sweater material you know
how like around your sweaters around
like the collar and the the I forgot
what it's called it's on the tip of my
tongue too but it's kind of like that so
it doesn't lay as flat as I would like
it in the front because of that reason
so I just went ahead and sold it down
which you get it gave me two bundles
they gave me a bundle of 12-inch and a
bundle of 14-inch and I went ahead and
hot glue this because I already knew
that for me to sit here and and and glue
this would it just been a lot for no
reason I mean so did y'all I'm over the
place just so it it just would have been
a whole lot for no reason so I just
opted to go ahead and hot glue it and I
do this all the time when I'm doing
really quick units when I don't feel
like like if it's something basic like
I'm about to just wear a blunt Bob I'm
not gonna put all of this extra
into it but when I have things like
color and stuff like that I know how to
like distribute the color and keep
washing it is better that I saw it so
I'm just using an art mind glue gun and
the bigger art mine tubes they come
really long they're not the small like
point four four ones or was it I think
the point eighteen ones I think that's
what it was one of the two but I'm not
using the smaller ones I'm using the
thicker ones and the thicker long ones
so I'm just since it's four bundle
amines or wish if it since it's only two
bundles what I'm doing is I'm just
spreading them out evenly so I can make
sure that everything ends up covering
because that's not a lot I wish they
would have sent me like two and a half
maybe even three and I would have left
over here but you could be able to make
this work if I were to make them not so
close at the bottom then everything
would have fit I had to take a leftover
bundle that I had just sitting around it
was literally one track and put it at
the top to close everything which I
believe is some old hot Beauty hair that
I actually already had sitting around I
went and looked for the box because
those boxes I still keep a lot of them
and when I have extra hair I just keep
it for reasons like this so I can keep
the hair cohesive to the brand so if
you're gonna hot glue gonna unit just be
careful to not burn yourself because
I've got a couple of marks especially
one on my leg which is so random from a
glue mark that I mean a glue that just
like dripped off and it got me bad it
looked so gross so that's what we're
doing here is we're just gonna go around
and go around the entire head you see
I'm putting a lot of space which then it
starts to look if you think if you ever
wore like a lace front and you know they
put the tracks in the back it starts to
look like this when you open the back it
has this because it's not a lot of hair
that's on to the actual cap but once you
put the rest of that hair at the top of
that closure and then you bring
everything down then yeah for sure so
that's all it is
I just wish I would have use one of my
own caps the ones I use all the time
because I feel like if I would have done
that this would have been a better
situation I just wasn't crazy
about cuz I knew it was the closure and
you already know closures are a little
bit harder to make look natural Dan
frontals are because frontals give you
much more flexibility and because Kim's
part is so clean I didn't want to pull
out any baby here in the front I did I
wanted to leave it exactly as if like
the photo that you guys seen his
thumbnail I wanted you to see it like
that
she don't Kim got hers unless she got a
glazier it off or she gets it waxed off
but if you look at North's hair that's
not Kim's hair used to look if you look
at it now she makes sure she gets to
know baby if everything is super clean
so I wanted to keep it like that now
while I'm still doing this I want to
talk about the actual closure itself
it's really nice like it's super duper
like to the point it's not a big thick
piece it's just that one particular in
stationary so you're not gonna be able
to do much with it
other than what you're seeing right now
which is that middle part but they I
didn't bleach the closure just because I
feel it was unnecessary due to the
simple fact that it was so clean in the
middle because there's no hair right
there so they literally just made sure
they did not vent any hair down this
long line so here I'm just going and
struggling to get these pins out and
then took this off like I was really
fighting with this job so here I'm just
gonna go ahead and Flatiron this before
I cut it so I can make sure that
everything is as straight as it could be
for the most part so that when I cut it
and then go flat on it everything is it
not a choppy mess and you guys know flat
ironing is not enough I use my
Sebastien's my Sebastien's hairspray and
then I used my beyond the zone Flatiron
spray so you can see has a lot of a nice
little flow to it so here I'm just gonna
go because I'm big going based on what
hers looked like and we're just gonna go
through and give it a nice so this is
how I just usually start with my cut is
gonna be and then from there I go and
even it out and we just go all the way
around and literally you just following
the line of cutting when our hair was
not even all the way around it seems to
be that it was shorter in the back and
in a little bit longer in the front from
the photos that I've seen
so I tried to keep it as close to that
as possible without not making it look
like an asymmetrical bob cuz that's not
what she heard but I wanted to get as
close as possible so use some super
super super sharp shears and I'd like to
not go for one side and all the way
around I like to do the Front's first
because if I find if you go all the way
around you're gonna come back on the
other side and it's gonna be so uneven
like it's gonna have a slant to it and
you don't want it to have a slant tool
right now you gotta cut it shorter so I
tend to do the Front's first and then I
go ahead and do the back but literally
all you're doing is little just cutting
just cut it all and that's pretty much
what I'm doing it you're like anyway and
there you go that's what she had it's
not a very hard thing to do just make
sure that you try it on and pick a place
to cut it I did that off-camera where I
just picked where I wanted it to be and
that's what I'm doing now here I'm just
even in and out just to make it looks
like it's longer in the back just
because of the way that the mannequin it
is but it's actually even all the way
around I want too hard you know so it's
simple you can I'd literally did this in
like 45 min well like an hour because
it's in about 45 minutes
well no I think it was 40 because
usually if I do a 4 bundle wig that I
hot-glue it took me about 45 minutes
this was only two bundles so between the
two bundles and the actual cutting it
would took me about 45 minutes so this
is something that you can do that
SuperDuper quick when you know like for
instance when you like me and you get
dates mixed up and then you got like an
event to go to but you ain't got no
fresh wigs and you know yous gonna make
one but you gotta like get it together
next couple of hours you could do this
real quick and nobody would ever know
and not ever so yeah that's pretty much
it and then you just try it on to make
sure it's good just make sure when I win
blow girl you don't um you grabbed him
sides cuz again this is not a frontal
bone this is you know just a closure and
I like to go in with my clippers as
y'all know and these are just some
regular like $19 canary clippers that
are going with and even things out and
then I'm gonna go over it again with the
flat iron to make sure that everything
is Super's to move
and then you'll be done so 30 to 45
minutes you could do this depending on
your speed - because I can do this in my
sleep if you're a little slower with it
then it's gonna take a little bit more
time so here I'm just going in to get
really the tops of it to make it because
I want the bottom to still have body to
it I don't wanna make it too straight
where it's just super flat so I'm taking
some sebastian's and we're just going in
I had already sprayed the entire head
with the Flatiron spray it does give it
this nice shine the hair didn't come
like this actually put it in with the
shine but it just gives us this nice
sealed in factory slave look but you see
how far that part goes back girl inches
okay
so you guys know I love my I call them
the Kardashian parts for a reason so I
thought this was very smart for them to
go ahead and make and there you go so
her pretty much looked just like this it
was super quick I look super dry and I
hope you guys enjoy this catch y'all on
my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
