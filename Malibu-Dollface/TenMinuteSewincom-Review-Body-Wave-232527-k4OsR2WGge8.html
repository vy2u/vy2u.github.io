pretty much what it looks like when I
finished out on this one particular side
the other side isn't done so if you can
see there is the difference no snacks no
shedding surprising there is no shedding
this is where the like when I first
received it look how bouncy the curls
are this is a cap construction very
and what they do where they put the
ounces and the lanes you have inside the
capsule unit before the kick okay so
today I'm going to review a new cup not
only the company is necessarily new but
I've just recently heard about them and
you guys always ask me about my you
heart and what do you do and how is it
do you make them do you sell them so
this is something I think that's gonna
be a little bit easier make it a little
bit more simple for you guys to do
instead of having to like sit there for
hours on end making a new part it's the
new Hollywood 10 minute sew-in now I
have it in now and I have it in length
of 23 25 and 27 the texture is body wave
and it is the weight is 14 ounces most
hair comes and when you buy them in
bundles they come in four ounce bundles
of hair I have 14 it is very heavy what
is that like like oh my god my my head
heavy but it is it has weight on it or
whatever so one side I purposely did
this side is the natural body wave that
came in the hair and this side is the
side that I decide that I curl myself to
see what the difference would be because
I thought it would be just a little bit
different so you guys could see there is
a difference in how the natural state is
versus what it looks like when you curl
it so this as you can see there is a
difference this side has more of a wave
pattern to it and then the crows idea
worm or some loose more looser you know
crows waves whatever you want to really
call it or whatever but this I they're
more bouncy now this hair is very tight
when you get it
so getting the curl out was a bit of a
task but once I got it out it was
beautiful this hair is some of the
softest hair that I've ever had in my
life because it's really like you see
it's really just flowing and it's bouncy
so if you want that like what I'll call
that pillow hair this
the perfect hair for you um the way that
the unit is how I have attached is the
way I would do a typical you part the
difference is a typical you part you
take a dome cap and then you take the
cap and then you sew all of the hair you
know track-by-track or you double your
tracks and then you cut out the top part
to lead out your leave out with this
what they do is they put each of its
like you know you see like wigs like
regular wigs or whatever and then they
have like the tracks that are in the
back and then it's like the net that
they attach it's like it's hard to
explain it's like little pieces that go
around us the unit and then they put
each track on those little pieces to
make up the entire unit and that's how
this one is done so our curl two side
didn't curl this side I just left it as
is so there's nobody here everything you
know here is flat and then it's a little
bump here and then it's this this hair
has given me no problems I've had it in
for the last two days it's giving me not
one issue not one problem it didn't shed
at all even when I was taking the curls
out of the front of it like all of this
on this side because you know these are
some pretty tight curls it didn't do
anything it it's perfect like this makes
me not want to go back to making you
parts although I am but it makes it much
easier so if you're not a well-versed in
sewing or know how to make a you heart
thick sometimes we can make them smaller
we can make them big depending on what
the situation is um I know that this
particular unit I have on to Harry from
Love &amp;amp; Hip Hop actually has this one
from them as well it says thank you for
purchasing from the Hollywood 10 minute
sew-in
we know that you're going to love your
unit this hair that you received at the
top of the line of virgin hair that has
been textured to receive its desired
curl pattern this revolutionary product
allows you to have a show in and around
ten minutes or less and remove it with
around five minutes or less here's a
brief instructions on how to apply the
new unit for specific details of
installation please visit our websites
Hitmen and so when calm and click on how
to install this took me less than 5 min
to put on like seriously because it's
one it's super flat and sometimes when
we do make you parts because we use so
many bundles it can sometimes get a
little bit on the lengthy side as far as
how long it takes to get in because when
you're throwing all of this hair on one
side and you're trying to slow it down
to your braids it does take a minute
the wedding that construct this it has
tabs around the unit to really help you
get that reinforcement in for the
someone that you're gonna do especially
with my unit being a more of a thicker
texture I did appreciate that it was it
doesn't feel as heavy as my you normal
you hard to do sometimes they feel a bit
on the heavy side because everything is
pulling because everything's on a braid
but the way that they constructed the
cap on this it's completely different
but I do love this unit I would
recommend it and for people we're gonna
say it's like a little pricey because
hair is pricey that's just the thing
like cheap and hair don't go together
cuz you'll be lying jazz waving Zuri so
I would say this it's this is gonna
arrange you between four or five hundred
dollars depending on what you get but
you think about the bundles that you buy
most bundles especially us who like long
hair your longest bundle probably with
let's just say it's thirty inches you're
gonna pay almost $200 for that bundle
and you're gonna need more than one of
that one bundle so that's let's just say
that's $400 for two bundles are already
that you just spent on 27 inches and you
still have to buy three or four more
bundles just the in-between so think
think of it that way and it's more of an
investment because you don't have to go
to the shop and get your hair done
anymore you just have to go get you just
have to braid it and sew it in that's
already done you don't have to worry
about taking tracks out of track by
track by track by track and key to
continue to have to buy more hair
because now you don't butcher the hair
put in layers in it and you took it out
and nowness their order is all wrong so
think about all the money you're gonna
save with this particular unit versus
buying and weft it here now don't get me
wrong I do love what they're and that's
what's in the unit is wefted hair but if
you're one of those people that just
like to get up and go this is perfect
you know if you don't have the time to
sit down and make new parts all day you
have to go to work out
kids you have to make it quick but you
still want to look presentable you still
when I look nice you still want some
beautiful hair this is completely
perfect um another thing is up a lot of
people you guys ask me well is there any
combs in the unit you can you put combs
in a unit you can put homes in it I so
mines down because I'm gonna be wearing
it probably for another - well no I plan
on keeping it in until my birthday which
is the 10th and today's the first so up
until my birthday I'm gonna wear it and
post pictures and something like that on
Instagram but you can't put combs in it
just to like get it to stay and it'll
say I just prefer to sell a gun because
I feel like it gives me more of a secure
and I brush very rough because you know
I just like yeah so I will be shifting
all over LA if I didn't put you know
slow it down correctly so yeah if you
have any questions about the Union and
you want to know more about it please go
to 10 minute sew-in comm it's a great
side shout out to my girl Missy Lin you
could go to her Channel and watch our
reviews of what she did below as well
because I believe she used Clips so if
you are not a solar person and you just
wanna look like take it on and take it
off and you don't want to have it down
for like a long period of time then
watch her video she got some great
points as well as great videos as well

down below and I'll be sure to get to as
many people as I can and I will talk to
you guys later and thank you to
