okay but anyway um just back to the
subject at hand we just been chillin
just Happy New Year yeah token of our
appreciation for you watching this
nigga's videos we love you guys I love
you I really love you and if you're like
in LA well you're cute and you like
girls don't go you got a preference you
know it's gonna finish you do you gotta
have nice breasts so let me ask you guys
what would you guys like to see happen
this year just a run of things as far as
music TV is concerned the Internet is
concerned like just a plethora of things
what would you guys like to see happen
that has not happened in previous years
music-wise I would say I'm tired of
seeing all these male vocalists like
they can't sing like Trey Songz is
boring Chris sound sounds like a girl
Chris songs the secret sauce Chris Brown
so look at that I mean I just want to
see entertainers like we'll bring you
better bring her ass out yeah Brandi let
me tell you something know for those who
are watching this harker twitter is
forever brain you tell her to go to
whatever time is on his damn video let
me tell you something real quick if you
release anything else like human I'm
done with joy ass for real because I
supported you since the fucking the
first album
okay with the burn in brains now we want
quality music release album with like 63
songs of yo shit there was way bomber
than human could ever been honest in you
in a label and they put out with a I'm
gonna put out true whatever but girl
listen if Beyonce I'm gonna bring girl
cuz on my young friends but if Beyonce
can go and control her music so can you
so let's get this shit poppin okay you
better get your life for real I love you
too boo oh that's what me obviously
that's what we saw hard on you okay
because we like quality music and Brandi
does it she does do that
does she that she don't release is the
shit of course obviously you're gonna
get some comments from some Beyonce
haters but I mean you you can't you
can't compare Beyonce to Brandi in this
video cuz we see anything and we got
three minutes left so therefore any
better any wave anywhere
exactly so I just want to see music do
better I want to I want some so now I'm
tired of the auto-tune if you can't
think he'd be a soporific um rappers be
rappers my finger rappers know Kim yeah
I mean as far as hip-hop is concerned I
would love for rappers turds I actually
rap I mean I think there should be like
a sub not even a sub I think there
should be like a new genre the fog wrap
up exactly that's exactly what it is
because that's what hip-hop is now
there's this side I mean it's working
for them because they're able to make
money in different areas like you know
ja Rule could admit whoa DMX couldn't
make money and Britney Spears you know
type of fan base he owned he had his own
but now somebody like Nicki Minaj she
can go right then they should like
everything I don't think that she can be
considered right because I think that if
we take away from what we already had
and you guys come and change it it just
everything that we've done before this
doesn't matter anymore
because it's not respected anymore it's
like oh well you know because it's
Roxanne Shan sayin you know MC Lyte and
Queen Latifah all endeavor was hardcore
rappers then Nicki Minaj still get
lumped in that category although she's
not even doing the same type of music
you know that's like putting Britney
Spears in the same
box is like TLC and I mean well I mean
they kind of worried those Chelsea was a
pop group they were a pop group but you
know a different that Britney Spears
song and TLC song even though I didn't
think it was written for TLC right but
Britney killed oh shoot
but I mean it sounded like it was done
for Tatyana
but Britney Spears still kill that shit
yeah bobby pins in a video in all this
video is laying now she got a bite me
right here right here right here and
right here
I just honestly I want to be entertained
I'm not entertaining it you know what
one thing I want to see this year a lot
and I'm hopefully I can be a part of
that and we all can be a part of that is
I want to see the art of music videos
comeback right because ty did a green
screen and a white background
yeah and I'm tired of like like this is
some Drake video I was watching I was
over somebody else and I was watching
this Drake video and it was absolutely
it was no story about us nothing Drake
was just sitting at a table smoking a
cigar
rapping and then he was in the elevator
going up and then the next thing he was
outside with hope it's a nigga standing
straight it didn't make any type of
sense it wasn't like it was nothing to
the video like what the fuck is is so my
questions are all the people who are
watching in the comments below write
what you want to see happening like this
year like what difference in
entertainment wise do you want to see
that we haven't been able to get what
are you longing for what are you missing
that you once had or may not even had
but you want to see that is different I
want to see Apple Lord a price is a big
fucking product either we get our high
dollar price cut please but one thing I
will say as far as music is concerned is
a lot of fucking unsigned artists that
are giving giving what I need like they
can meet what I think janae gives me
it's on it yeah but she was unsigned
released that hot ass fucking this tape
it's a lot of yen so you guys need to
like really look out for these on stun
signs because they're killing
honestly a lot of the unsigned are
killing a lot of people that have
million dollar budgets on that's why
mixtapes are doing better than action
studio I'll write you know even like
when you think about rap Kendrick Lamar
is killer
yeah killing it like ridiculously so I
as far as a song I
I think more people need to get behind
and behind these people and support them
because that's really your good music
you're not gonna get no good music from
Trey Songz and I mean I don't want to
hear any type of strip from Chris Brown
it's just really boring
all right guys wait wait can I said what
were you gonna say I'm gonna film the
video to my song you guys and we gonna
be in hopefully yeah right all right am
i okay I'm not gonna be on the album but
I'll do a couple songs well like I said
I'll make a cameo anyway yeah I'm gonna
do that so it should be out in the
summer before this summer see me man cuz
you know what a cameo maybe you read a
video all right we go peace you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
