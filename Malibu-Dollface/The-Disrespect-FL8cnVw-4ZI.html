break from my reviews and stuff like
that in my halls and and all this stuff
because I know that a lot of you guys
are subscribed to me because of videos
like the one I'm about to do now and I
don't want to alienate y'all like I get
it I'm not going to we're we're gonna
keep it we're gonna make a nice little
gumbo of shit on this channel but today
I'll just what this video is just going
to be called the disrespect you know and
how people a lot of times expect it but
they do not give it and I have a lot to
say okay and nobody is off-limits today
so you guys know I've been on the
internet for a number of years at this
point and a lot of people tend to be
very disrespectful that follow me these
are not my friends you know and these
are people who follow me who feel like I
guess because I do these videos they
feel they can say and do whatever they
want to me and am not supposed to say
anything back but I'm not that bitch
so y'all gonna get some back it's just
it's inevitable like you ain't assaulted
me like I'm crazy like I owe you
something bitch you know so um me and my
friend were having a conversation and
she said how do you feel like how do you
handle when people who follow you are
supposed to support you and things like
that are disrespectful to you I said I
never have an issue with people having
their own opinion and we can have a
debatable conversation about whatever
the topic may possibly be that's fine
but you're not gonna disrespect me
you're not gonna get stupid and you're
not gonna get out of line I try to throw
something in my face that I said like
people love to take these videos and use
them against me since I well you had
said you okay I said I never said I
didn't say it I'm allowed to change my
mind I'm allowed to operate in a
different way that you don't like I mean
just because your mental capacity is not
to the fullest extent that it can be
because you refuse to take it there it
has nothing to do with me you know I'm
saying like just because you say
something one time doesn't mean that
that's how it's going to be for the rest
of your life you may change your mind
tomorrow something you may see do here
whatever you may be allowed to change
your mind and I do that because I can do
that
it is what the hell it is so
we were having a conversation or
whatever and she had said that one of
her grandmother's friends disrespected
her and I was just like no like an old
lady and she was like she's so old and
she disrespected me you know and I was
always taught to respect my elders and I
was too but my mom was a little vague
with that because I've seen her go off
on plenty of older people for being
disrespectful to her so she basically
her philosophy was listen you be
respectful don't go out there acting
stupid but if a bitch do try you try her
own ass back - so I mean that's that's
just how I am and that's just how I am
today because I feel there is a certain
level of respect that everybody is old
old old you know at some point and I
don't think because you're older you're
allowed to be disrespectful because
you've been here longer I won't give a
fuck if you got here yesterday or you
got on this motherfucker where there was
nothing but bones dinosaurs and dirt I
don't care ok I'm not I don't fuck about
none of that you're gonna respect how I
feel you don't have to agree with it
which you need to respect him because I
didn't come in to disrespectfully I
wasn't rude to you I didn't say shit
about your mama I didn't say shit about
some gay fast teeth I didn't say shit
about you know I'm saying that the Boxee
has Bobby I didn't say nothing I was on
my own so she said that um that she
disrespected her she called her out of
her name because she called her and she
didn't hear and she was I guess she was
calling her do something she did so she
called her bitch and she said bitch I
know you hear me and I had to clench my
pearls y'all out let me tell you
something and I woulda came up to her
motherfucking level because I know she
got scoliosis and I with a guy right
here with that bitch and I was let me
tell you something Gertrude let me tell
you something Mabel I will fuck you up
and run your motherfucking pressure
through the roof if you try it with me
one more time I will work your own ass
because sometimes you gotta go there
with them sometimes because a lot of
them feel entitled
to say and do whatever I don't give a
fuck how many grandkids you got how many
motherfucking medicines you take how
many times you take your ass to dialysis
how many motherfucking needles you gotta
stick in your arm you will not be
disrespectful this day to this bitch
that don't work so as far as older
people are concerned that I can't do
because I don't give a fuck if you are H
or a T you're gonna respect me okay
whatever you feel about me is your
personal shit but when you come out the
side of your motherfucking mouth talkin
crazy to me and you gonna call me a
bitch night school and my friends call
me you know bitch did it but you called
me a bitch with a little bit of hate up
in there it was a little salt I smell
some sour grapes when you said it like
that was too much that would you girl
you gave me 1949 shade and I bitch I
wasn't ready for that I'm not equipped
for that right now so therefore we gonna
have to fix some shit so I don't go for
that and the same thing with children I
don't care who your mama is and I'm let
me say this for my subscribers who got
kids and I know a lot of y'all keep your
kids in line but some of y'all I'm sure
be slacking if you are in the store and
your child is not near you and they are
running they little bad nephew here than
ever around the store it makes you look
like a badass parent period no matter
what you do you look like the bad mom
and it really is sucks when the momma's
be on the phone yes girl
yup you know Timmy stop it you need to
stop slow down slow down you need to
knock him in his motherfucking mouth and
drag his ass through the fucking ice
cream al because he don't get like I'm
not about abusing children trust me I'm
not but some kids need a swift one to
kick and you need to drop they fucking
fronts so they can understand where you
coming from
and I think that's very
respectful in general just in public to
have your children running around that's
just tacky that's just really tacky so
and then with my peers okay
there are a lot of times where we will
go out in the gay community and then
there's just a bitches say stuff but
they don't say it where you can hear
them they say whether their little crew
can hear it so it's like they did
something but a bitch would never step
to you and say the shit you and I'm
saying it whenever and I don't deal with
the shit often but every night a little
trouble I mean especially when I get a
fresh weave the shit gets ridiculous
especially from the females and I can't
stand like I love my chicks I do I love
y'all to death but some of y'all are the
most jealous mad bitches I have ever met
in my life and the first thing that come
out of your mouth as you wish you had a
coochie i'ma tell you this bitch or a
pair of titties tell you this if I
wanted a coochie I would have been happy
and it would be as prettier than yours
it will be tighter than yours it will be
more glamorous than yours and it have
way less mouths put on it as in yours
so understand if I wanted it kept us
believe I would have had it but I'm very
happy with the equipment that I was
brought and it's not my fault that show
weave ain't is flies minds and it ain't
my fault that your motherfucking lips
and it's big as minds and it ain't my
fault that your skin ain't a smooth is
mine crusty it's not my fault so if you
have a problem with someone and you feel
intimidated or some type of problems
don't disrespect the bitch compliment a
hoe you know it's just it's that simple
this respect will get you nowhere it
will get you nothing but a black eye a
bloody shirt and a rocket dang it what
like what the fuck like y'all need to
learn to shade the shady shit that y'all
love so much the job think it's cute
it's not cute it's not because it
especially when it comes
from a grown-ass adults who knows better
and they're on the internet trying you
but you know in person it'll be all deaf
it up you know I was just playing it's
like okay so when I stock you in your
lips and your teeth fall down your
throat and you hold in your fronts you
know I was just playing you know like
you got to be careful because that's a
lot you can search there are a lot of
bitches who don't got the ass with over
Twitter for disrespect it's something we
don't play with that the times may
change you know I'm saying the Sun may
set in in the east and the west but
disrespect in the way that you give it
it will be the way that you receive it
because there's some bitches who do not
play with that and especially when y'all
get out of lining y'all start on my
peoples Mama's and stuff over time I
people's babies and all type of people
don't come to kids and people I'm
talking about their mamas and when you
get your ass whooped and then your whole
fucking you party sitting in the middle
of the street don't call for help you
put that on yourself when you was big
bad bitch on instagram talking about
bitch which you won't
I'm just saying so again when you go out
in public and you see people and you see
children and you see elderly people or
whatever always speak always be nice
always be presentable because if
somebody do try because I always speak
and I always say thank you and I always
say please I know if a bitch tried me is
because they wanted to because I give
you no reason to do the shit you want it
do you want it this fight bitch let's do
this cuz I'm oh I'm aware yo ass out
especially if you were old bitch cuz
imma show you bitch there's a new
motherfucking sheriff in town okay you
dirty a Mabel unis all you girls that go
to bingo together imma let you know
right now it is not going to work it is
2013 and just because your motherfucking
ass was born and fucking 1305 has
nothing to do with now show respect and

motherfucking day deal and I will talk
