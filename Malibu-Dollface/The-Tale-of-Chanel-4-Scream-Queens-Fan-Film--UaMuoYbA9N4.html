thoughts of fame fortune time never
murder we often wonder what it would be
like to be one of them
we often wonder oh it's the grass really
greener on the other side
meet Durrani group heir to the 250
million dollar Griffin estate he was
born August 1st and 1993 to Tanisha and
Alec Griffin this is supposed to be a
beautiful time for the family but
sometime very sad see Durrani was
supposed to be a twin but his sister did
not make it they say when one hurts the
other fills it Durrani group detached
depressed different after being
criticized and radicular as a child his
parents had him taken to some of the
best doctors that money could buy
they said he would grow up emulating his
sister would have once become but very
little understanding of the world he was
both in school if you know friends they
say that irani would talk to himself as
he played as a child if there was a
spirit of his long-lost sister that he
would play at the age of 17
Durrani's parents died in a car accident
he inherited his father's two hundred
and fifty million dollar fortune with no
friends and no guidance he became
reckless and loose with money and this
was where people say things got very
very interesting have you feel inspired
down the pain
only gonna wanna knee to anytime I got a
sweet tune and no he wait there's more
one day while browsing Instagram he
stumbled upon Chanel over he became
totally obsessed with her everything
from the way she dressed up into the way
that she looked down to her nail shape
he wanted to be just like her he will
believe not having a mother he attached
herself to this total stranger slowly
but surely the change started dubbed the
rodeo bull he would go with his newfound
friends and laugh the lessers
by this time he started to value who he
was by the size of his bank account the
problem was his bank account had
depleted to nearly nothing with his
house being in foreclosure and his
Bentley being a repo he went nearly
crazy try to upkeep the lifestyle that
he could no longer afford it was a
ticking time bomb and everyone around
him was waiting for him to simply just
blow one beautiful sunny afternoon
Durrani decided say a bit of a timeout
at the ball draped in which is Evans
from Espino he looked like the 25
million dollars
to keep demo calories carbs and blood he
figured cotton balls should cushion
dipali
just as well this is also where people
say he lost state on his assistant
excuse me you know underpaid and
overworked city worker yeah I need you
here
she had been this assistant for at least
three years and he still refused to call
her by her real name most of us now
believe that he didn't even know him
her sole job was to simply make him look
perfect with fears of losing her job she
did whatever he acts and every which way
he would ask with a no hesitation he
ordered her to run around the wool for
at least in half an hour
fill in tired and defeated she continued
to do whatever he wanted and his every
beckon call even though he was evil to
her she built a sense of pity for him
and this day just wasn't with a bad case
of body dysmorphia disorder he see
myself as unattractive and ugly I wonder
what he looked like and would take it
out on the closest person to him ugly
bitch listen
to make this ready and dunk our downtown
whoops
his assistant was later fired with no
references and no Serpent's pay she went
into a rage saying that she would quote
kill him next time she seen him one
night of hard shopping he gets a
mysterious message from Chanel Oberlin
on Instagram she says she loves
everything about him and wants him to be
the honorary Chanel number four she
gives him her address to the current
glue she sorted she's add supposedly and
wants him to stop by after a few hours
of shopping and realizing he's been
totally screwed he decides to head home
and this is where they say things get
very very scary
starting
ah sure they have a great
I'm that's next and final round
