we're gonna do a commentary for scream
queens of Chanel number four story so I
watched the show and I didn't think I
was gonna like it initially but after
watching it actually became a big fan of
it after episode one and I called you
and I said I want to do like the death
of Chanel number four because she didn't
exist in the show she got meningitis and
died but I want to have more of a back
story and that was it and then it turned
into this big long project that we
didn't anticipate inserted into but I
was don't shake your hip itch I was very
happy that it ended up being wait what
kept adding and adding and adding yes
it's true I I did that so I will take
the hell over there I I did bad yeah I'm
gonna take it out sometimes well I just
thought that it was a story I needed to
be told and again I yeah I had to make
sense because originally when I was
edited it really may not say yeah it was
not enough footage okay so this opening
scene I actually shot myself something
very proud and I colored this scene is
what I did not shoot this a Rodale show
it at all um and then I decided to cut
at first this had none of these inserts
in it was just the tree line and then I
decided to go ahead and change it up a
little bit because I just thought that
it would yeah it would make more sense I
did do the title sequence they remind me
like a reality show
kinda yeah and then these inserts of the
the dramatic screams Oh daddy scream I
put those there because I want you to
know something bad was gonna happen I
did shoot that a tree shot
you shot the shuttle which I don't know
what you don't like because I think it's
just because it wasn't one of the
pictures that wasn't focused
it wasn't focus no
like slightly out of focus there you go
it's a big hit Kelly I think I was like
two or three in this picture and I just
thought it would be a great back this
house is actually in the Palisades and
no we do not have a permit to use it
um I'm drape the mosquito and Gucci for
this shot because I wanted you guys to
kind of see evolution from the tennis
shoes and the staggered to the heels in
the first well I do you wear this all
the time because I'm sure the people on
and on like these with a mosquito so I
only wear it if I'm doing something I
don't just go like oh let me go throw in
his home as skeino right and go to out
this bib is mommy Georgia Jobs made sure
the story line I just wanted it to make
sense and I feel like if he was
dimension and a little bit confused
about who he was then it would make more
sense about the type of person he's
become as he got older and losing his
parents definitely would kind of do that
to a person so I thought just let add
insult to injury because no matter how
you look yeah you're in size is
really and I that's kind of what I
wanted to convey with this now we'll use
the DJI you did not shoot these Donna
anything for this good old crane shot
yeah you shot all of these um miss Kino
stuff we did this on Sunday night but
that wasn't on point we shot that
there's some stranger's house
she was shaking his shoe this is also
under Burley Hills just a side note with
the combination of the head of the doll
of the phone and the outfit I was very
very uncomfortable and it was huh Richie
was like I had him for like two days
yeah he was sweet very brand-new he's
much bigger than that now
this particular page competed extra in
at the in the Overland but it's not the
Roche no space nahhh trail ride I
decided to use this fan page because why
not
i used this shot as a reference to what
he would eventually I did have Morocco's
teen glasses on and I didn't wear them
cuz it was nighttime I got this little
translation was dope because show the
difference of what he was versus will he
became you got earliest big shout out to
Elliott thank you for letting us use
your fingernail it's oh no you can talk
about alright so we shot this literally
like a hundred times really for about
hour and that was the last shot we shot
like the chick coming out I was freaking
priceless priceless scuse me we had TMZ
trucks like stopping trying to figure
out what the we were filming it was
this ridiculous to see two black dudes
dressed like this in Beverly Hills is
very unusual
what do you think I've seen it there
yeah um the pool scene I thought this
was a great scene because they kind of
showcase originally it was supposed to
be like four different situations that
led up to him being a total and utter
bitch to people so what this particular
scene we decided to have it at the pool
downstairs because it was um
easy we had access to it yes repeat the
chair in the camera bag in the back -
alright I know that I didn't know how
you just totally super strict like
this was the homage to the show my pores
the biggest book um to the show where
the girls decided to eat you know they
eat uh cotton balls versus um food all
right and he didn't eat it I did not
swallow that okay
that thing is thick it tastes disgusting
there was a die if he ate it yeah I
think the ingestion would be terrible
there is a whole lot of dialogue here
but the reason why I was not used
because the audio issues that we had
there is a major intersection right
behind us and the traffic noise I mean
it was so bad it was everyone's car
accident it was the mid day like
European you could think of that
particular day that what happened it was
so busy and it just sounded so bad even
the external stuff we got it was still
just tore out and I'm like just so I
won't sound have you live to like it's
really busy as you're so busy so all of
this stuff we shot really quick and this
day wasn't as sunny as I would have
liked it to be gloomy it was very good
even lucky because the Sun peeped out a
little bit right at the end we tried to
make it happen Oh shout out to Keanu she
shot out to Keanu Best Actress man I
want to do something else yeah it was
great yeah I know is Keyshia by the way
yeah and this outfit that I'm wearing is
a nice room essential style and I also
and we're in a Nate Berkus towel with a
one-piece bodysuit and a mosquito terry
cloth jacket like when dresses like that
and think that I just had to be
obnoxious as I did not really throw
my phone in the pool I threw my case in
the bowl
brother there's no key no case um this
was supposed to be a reshoot for the
scene that's coming up however because
it was at night and we were really late
it was like his well almost midnight
and when we originally shot the scene is
coming up it was earlier than that so
the bukhari
score that we shot in front of the
lights were off so you could tell that
it just didn't match so I decided to
and use it for them this was the first
not the first thing we shot but this was
the first day we shot yeah all the stuff
that you guys are about to see for the
most part first and everything you seen
been a vegan it was shot last which is
funny but you guys see like the lights
in this wall behind all those lights
were all clearly or if your car is
missing I would not wonder where my car
is I believe let me find the total
numbers like this is my car I did not
pay my operation and I thought having
these walking directions wouldn't make a
lot of sense because we all use our GPS
now and he wouldn't been he's rich but
lo was rich but he wouldn't necessarily
know when I'm like like that he probably
know where Foothill Road is but how to
get there not in a car yeah
this wasn't a coal ee all right shallots
in the coast our hostel ever now this
was a reshoot this was the last part
your favorite I was in details for about
four hours at this point so the spec
that that was not old but I definitely
feel I wanted in the fall I really did I
thought I would be a little more
dramatic but that's - you as a red
double this one ratio thank God because
I felt like this because all of it at
first was just me walking I just feel
like I added this later when I had went
out separately as promised so this was
this was the same Mary yeah yeah this is
so we shot with Nicole yeah all of this
is pretty much the first thing okay
and it was so warm which I was
so happy but when we we did those reason
yeah my god it was no I was so ready to
die to put all this back on I said
where the skirt in the shoes I think I'd
have to put that out going I shot this
particular part cuz I feel like it kind
of showed his point of view of what he's
saying which you see nobody in a vaccine
right but I played this scene the same
every single time so that
it can be like that that's like eight
scenes in one so as you guys can see I
have layers now and I didn't have those
before and this was a reshoot because I
feel like the anticipation it kind of
jumped and then we out of course we go
back to me trying to find a phone which
I wouldn't have one right but you didn't
even look for the phone the first time
no perfect this was Nicole in a back
seat yeah it was a lot of people in that
one particular that's nice too gangster
had the blood tastes disgusting
um this scene I just wanted you to kind
of feel that he's dying at this
particular point like there's like Halle
kidding red yeah he's not coming back
from this at all um you had me sit in
the car forever
wait his blood all over me and tell me
not to you see how my hand moves a
little bit even though that was dope the
blood on the windshield was after think
it was posed to be a shot of all of this
blood coming out of my mouth and
shooting towards the steering wheel but
the problem was it was a mess it was
blood everywhere we had to do it twice
my wishes feeling the same
but it just didn't work so I decided to
use the insert as of aftermath of
somebody done within a car a lot of guys
ask me what does your car look like now
how long did it take for you guys to get
it out my father's actually now the name
Durrani crippling actually is to one of
the girls from the dash dolls I think
she's like Muslim or something like that
mr. irani my name is Durrani in the last
name grip link comes from Courtney
crippling from esto by ginger oh you
know why not yes Courtney was richest
 so I kind of made this character
based on her a little bit
oh yeah um thank you guys for supporting
their thank you guys for watching so
many times telling your burns we do plan
to do more things like this in the
future and I'm happy even though all the
fighting we went through we got it up
this went through like 85 release day
thus that's how you get good products
yeah because a lot of those drone shots
and all of that doesn't even I got
that no that would have been in here
cops in the IceMen or the drunk a know
that I was out it came out at the end of
December so yeah it worked out but thank
you guys for watching and Aikido and the
Knicks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
