I want you guys a bit of a background we
go to Six Flags gay night every year
here in California and this footage is
from 2016 but in 2015 we went and we all
got on except for her and one of her old
friends he said that he did we were just
like I'm scared I don't want to get on
the is hi is select Luther drop of
doom which is coincidentally right on
the side of Superman and while it's
running so they run simultaneously
it was loud the is high it's waves
I didn't want to get on but again I
wanted to say I experienced this she
didn't get on so for an entire year we
ceased her about being scary as and
not getting on so she claimed that it's
because she wanted to keep this stranger
that she did not know company and she
wanted to go ahead and sit with him so
this was us pretty much tossing her to
get on her last year and she got on and
this was her reaction and I wanted you
guys to see because she talks a good
game but check that reaction shot people
yes enjoy you ready all right all right
this is a fun one homage I can't do that
ah
we'll be the high point of your
insignificant existence
hahahahahahaha</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
