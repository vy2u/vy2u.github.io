feet answer the big big feet just like
this they want to dance to the big baby
just just like me huh the big big deep
it goes the big bed all right guys so
this is a little different than what you
guys are probably used to because
normally when I have curly hair like
such I never really like to wear it whet
I usually are not wet per se but more so
in its natural state I to keep it in the
bigger state but it is summertime and
everybody's trying to get summertime fun
so I decided to go ahead and do
something a little different that I am
not used to so this hair is from the
vanity hair box and I am wearing their
Brazilian curly with an 18 inch frontal
and I'm wearing four bundles of 22
inches now my corresponds with this
particular company has been for a while
now because we had we contract this is
you a review like last year sometime and
then I guess they we went ahead and
rebranded so it took a while for me to
actually get my hair um and then I got
it earlier this year so this is the
texture itself um I haven't did anything
special to the hair I literally just put
it in I bleached my frontal so that my
frontal could be the color of my skin as
you can see I didn't cut all of this off
only because there's going to be baby
here right here once I end up cutting my
front so a little bit more I didn't want
that crazy a baby hair look that
everybody's doing where it's like coming
down a face kind of like Brandis Barbie
I'm not trying to
I don't want to do that so testing
awesome technique that actually works so
that's the only reason why my lace is
still a little bit on there um this is
the natural texture of it when it's wet
when I received it and I did install it
the hair itself was actually really
large it was really big and for 22
inches it feels much longer than that
when it's big when it's in its natural
state like such um then it's calmed down
it doesn't seem as if it's so much my
curls however are very soft too like
they're very very soft my hair smells
great I'd like to put this conditioner
that has a scent to it just keeps the
hair smelling great because when you
start to put water and products in any
moisture in your hair if you continue to
do that your hairs going to eventually
start to stink and if it's not properly
dry it will mildew so to avoid that um
use something with a nice scent that you
can bear because again hair is in my
face okay the last thing I want to do is
have funky hair but not only that you
don't want to be out in public and you
walk past somebody in your hair smells
like a wet mangy dog because that's not
attractive neither so when you do put
any crow cream or just a combination of
water and some type of moisture so that
your hair will not dry out make sure it
has a great scent to it because you have
to deal with that all day long when I
received it it didn't have a smell at
all it just it was just soft curly hair
it didn't have like a putrid smell or
something that I just couldn't take but
again like I said after you have this
hair for so long and you start putting
it um putting moisture on it and it yes
just say for the sake of saying you
don't dry it properly for whatever
reason um if it does start to get a
little numb your decide that um smell
what actually helped mask it until you
wash it my advice for people who wear
their curly hair on a regular basis is
wash your curly hair at least twice
within a two-week period so once a week
but make sure you co wash it at least
every five days if you're wearing it on
a consistent basis if you wear it every
now and then you're fine but if this is
going to be your only hair that
where throughout the summer make sure
you keep the moisture in it and I cannot
stress that fact enough a lot of people
will buy hair and then they get mad when
their hair tangles and it mats all back
here ok mind you all of this will start
to map on you if you don't mind and I'm
at it ok and the reason is because you
have to make sure that you properly
co-wash and you run something that's
going to loosen the curl it's going to
loosen the way that's not going to lock
your hair because tap water is going to
do that it's going to take the pH
balance out of your hair and it's going
to start to get matted and you're going
to end up with a big just roadkill mess
and then a lot of people do they get mad
at the company and say they the hair
matted on me and this this is that any
other and is that it's proper hair care
ok it's part and I'm sure either they're
going to send it to you I don't know if
I don't remember mines came with it but
I'll check this piece of paper tells you
all the things that you would need to
know about your hair so they have one
call about the hair virgin hair is
chemically unprocessed human hair it
tells you about that it's just oh my
hands occasionally some ends can split
this is sign of authentic virgin hair
everything that you would need to know
about your hair in order to keep it in
the correct um in the correct so it
tells you things problems that you may
possibly encounter common things that
happen with um with virgin hair just and
this is a good thing to have because if
you're worried about something or you
feel something may be a little bit off
this paper pretty much covers all of it
which they did a great job doing
jalisa thank you for my package dear so
I use a combination of my guardian foo
T's crow calm down which is this I used
my Tresemme moisture a shampoo the onion
shampoo conditioner um and up some water
and I put it in a spray bottle and I
went ahead and sprayed my hair down so
my hair is at a bit damp but it's not
like dripping wet um and then what this
does is because you have to use a nice
amount of it's a 24-hour defining crow
cream but what you have to do and be
careful with this if you use a lot of it
it will put too much moisture which has
protein in it and will break your hair
but if you
more water you probably want to do like
this much it is this much water and
probably that much conditioner and it
just keeps my hair hydrated throughout
the day so that my hair does not frizz
up if it is hot because or once your
hair ends up drying you want it to dry
and you want it to stay like this the
last thing you want to do is it to get
bigger and then you look like a poodle
at the end of the day because your hair
you do have anything properly put in
your hair since I've had it um I haven't
had any issues with it except for one
major issue and my one major issue with
this has been my shedding my shedding
has been a whole lot in I'm not used to
my curly hair being shedding as much and
I noticed that it will only shed a lot
if I put water in it if I put why not
water any but if I put any type of
moisture to it then it wants to shed a
lot towards the bottom and I did not
come on trucks with this
I actually just folded them over because
my new my hair was not gonna be bone
straight so there's no reason for me to
go ahead and cut them so they could be
SuperDuper flat they are however flat
but I need them to be straight hair flat
because the point in my hair it when
it's in the straightest form it will
look like this um so that's been my
biggest thing with this hair is that the
shedding and that's kind of the reason
why I don't really like to put moisture
into a lot of my curly hair I like to
wear it in its natural state because
after a while I noticed that most of the
curly hair that I've had that kind of
tends to be the issue is that I don't
know why um what the difference may be
from this from some straight hair but it
does quite a bit as far as uh
straightening it goes I straightened a
piece that I did not put in and then I
went ahead and put some moisture to it
and washed it and put some pro cream on
it and it was just like this just a
little more relaxed so you guys do know
if you do start to put a lot and lot and
a lot of heat in your curly hair then
eventually what's going to happen is
you're going to start end up with a wave
versus a girl which is not ideal and
also I did of course the strand test and
the hair did live now I don't know how
it would
look or how it would be if I literally
like bleach this hair like I've done
some of my other hair and if it would
still keep the same pattern because I
didn't want to try only because I'm a
little afraid because I do look how
beautiful this is and I don't want to
mess my hair up so I'll rather be safe
than sorry um I do I tend to do that a
lot with Alex right here because it's
just easier but because his hair is kind
of know walking apart I don't really
want to just ruin it because again the
summer is coming and I plan to wear this
hair um what I'm going to do is I'm
going to go ahead and seal my lips to
the cap because I don't want to take my
hair out so I'm just going to go ahead
and seal them and that go ahead and
calm down my shedding because that's the
only hang-up honestly that I have with
this hair is beautiful is full all my
bundles were very very full I love my
frontal for real my frontal looks very
very realistic like I bleached it so it
does look like a scalp it does mimic a
scalp it's not just a whole bunch of
black dots and it goes from ear to ear
so I can put it up in a ponytail and
that whole thing but I just wanted some
nice flowy beautimous so this is what it
looks like all to the front so this is
what it all looks like wet from the back
since everybody I never turn around the
length I like that they sent because
it's very much realistic it's not crazy
long because I find that if I get longer
or curly hair and then I go ahead and do
this method with it because it's so long
it pulls the hair so my hair don't look
originally did because it's so much
weight on it and I have so much product
when a depth piece is actually mine this
edge piece this part none of this is
mine none of this is mines oh I hope you
guys enjoyed this um click the links
below if you guys are interested in this
hair again I have an 18 inch frontal and
I have four bundles of 22 inches and
Brazilian curly mmm so I'll see you guys
