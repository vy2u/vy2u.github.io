and he a lot of times gets to the point
where he just gets like very down on
himself and then he just kind of shuts
off the world and doesn't want to talk
about life and no I know I got these
glasses on because my eyes are so red it
just it's like it turns me so awful you
know you don't want to deal with that
energy I was telling him he was like you
know it's crazy how it seemed like every
time something bad happens it's
magnified by 10 but then as soon as
something good happens it's just so
small in my nude and I was like that's
cuz you making it that way
you know and for me what I'm gonna tell
you what I've learned is socially
growing up he just in these last like
this last year I've learned so much and
I've learned to be happy with every
single little thing that I get okay and
when I say every little single thing I
get if I get two dollars extra on my
card for whatever reason a bitch is
happy if I happen to get
to the bank right before they close cuz
I need to make a good withdrawal and
they gonna let me in anyway because they
bout the calls that's good to me if I'm
able to be blessed with money coming in
here extra got some shoes on sale extra
gas don't went down extra every little
thing means something to me okay let's
just keep that in mind every little
thing means something to me and the
reason why I've become like that is
because where I come from and the things
that I've been through have definitely
put me to beat in this place because I
remember I used to get mad at the
smallish it could be so small and I
would let it ruin my entire day and you
gotta learn life ain't gonna always be
nice to you okay it's it's a it's a fact
rude disrespectful bitch at time it is
just like this area and get hurt people
don't understand that you know in order
to have and it's cliche to say but it's
very much the truth in order to see the
great things in life you have to go
through something because you ever hear
people say they have the
kid syndrome they've never been through
anything they never wanted for anything
so now they don't understand how when
people say no to them deal with life
because everything has just been given
to them they don't know what it is to
struggle and allow me to a bitch dance
trouble
strong gold duh but I am here now okay
so every single thing that I have now
I'm happy for from these damn pants I
got on to these glasses to these
earrings to this way to this nice
beautiful proof
I just I'm happy to be here I'm happy to
be in an environment and I know a lot of
times in my past I felt like it was
never going to change and this is my
reality and I was stuck in it and now
was it and now that I wouldn't I would
have saved the tears during those times
if I really would her knew it was gonna
happen and what I was pretty much
setting myself up to do a lot of times
in life do you don't know where you're
gonna end up you don't know what
tomorrow's gonna bring you don't know
what opportunity is gonna come or is not
gonna come you don't know if that thing
you've been working on for the last ten
years it's going magically pop you don't
know and the thing about life that's
scary is that you don't know there is no
promise for tomorrow there is no success
card that you can just give somebody and
you're gonna be alright
no but the great of the flip side of
that is that when you do go through all
these things and you do have things that
happen to you and your family and and
significant others that you start to
think you sit back and you think about
it and it's two ways you can take it one
everything happens for a reason - why is
it always me is those two things you can
think about and I remember being in a
relationship and didn't want that
relationship to end at all I didn't I
knew that it wasn't gonna last forever I
knew that it wasn't for me I knew I knew
that it was not gonna do me any good but
in that moment I was so heartbroken
because I just didn't want it to be over
I know at least it wasn't on my time I
wasn't done but I felt that was God's
Way of telling me you need to is over
it's over you have to let it go because
if I cannot get this person out of your
life and I don't know what the reason
was for for them to be eggs in my life
I don't know but it seems like soon as
that person was taken away from me I was
able to focus and be a better me
you never saying so I think a lot of
times you don't see it that way because
in that moment I didn't see it that way
I remember crying and crying and crying
and crying and crying I can't go I don't
know about that situation and now I sit
back what has it been almost two years
since that happened and I can tell you I
haven't never been happier I swear to
god I've never been happier and I have
never really I've never really set back
and thought about it into this very
moment about the things that I was doing
wrong a lot of times when were in
relationships or jobs or anything we
don't focus on the things that we should
focus on which is the betterment of
ourselves we're so busy trying to help
everybody else and that's been my
biggest issue in life with friends and
relationships family is I always want to
help but then the thing is people take
the help and they start using it as a
crutch and then you're you realize all
of this work you're doing as being
pretty much saying you and you're
supposed to do it because you're the
person you're to clean that person this
is what you do so then a lot of times
your feelings are hurt a lot of times
you feel gimped you feel disrespected
you feel used
you've got all these things because you
didn't follow what your plan was so a
lot of times when I see people and
they'd be like oh we've been on and off
for 10 years somewhere would that out of
ten years it was supposed to be over it
was I don't I don't believe no test
lasts no damn 10 years I'm guys look
good tell you but I've got a sneaking
suspicion that nobody's
test last 10 years and our relationship
I believe will be healthy enough to
withstand ten years of tumultuous mess
you know III if it was great for ten
years that's one thing but most of the
time when you ordered off it is for
reason so for me um a lot of times I
feel like a lot of my friends especially
they come to me because they look to me
to be the person that's gonna give them
the realest of the real without smacking
you down and making you feel like
complete another cuz I don't
believe in doing it if I'm gonna tell
you the real then I'm gonna tell you in
a way where I'm gonna make sure that I'm
not necessarily guard your feelings but
understand it that was me I wouldn't
want nobody talking to me like that you
know now we would miss the nighttime he
didn't cheated on you and you don't went
back and got cheated on again I might
have to get a little Stern with you I
might have to get up in your feelings
and a little bit of on your ass because
you know better but other than that I
try to treat people as as respectful
especially people who are my friends and
my family because I'm not very close to
a lot of people I'm the lone ranger like
a I won't buy my book
besides me and rich ancelotti other than
that I don't really with nobody
like that um you know and I do have my
close friends that I'm close with but
that still is to a degree you know
because a lot of people don't understand
what it is to be happy with being by
yourself
and when I say by yourself I don't mean
not in a relationship but can you
function for a whole week by yourself
without having a crush of calling a
friend calling this an if can other a
hookup
anything can you be by yourself and be
okay and I have to you you're not
sitting back tapping your foot trying to
figure out what's going on cuz I know I
can and I've tested myself to show that
I can I don't do I do so much our shot
by myself because I don't like nobody to
rush me bitch if I'm gonna go back to
 forever 21 26 times
because I'm feeling like the price might
change I want to do that without
somebody talking that to me so I
choose to row alone but other than that
I just feel like a lot of times in life
you never know where a situation will
take you better if you never take it and
everything isn't for you but also
remember be smart enough to understand
what's for you and what's not for you be
smart to understand that usually when
you have a doubt about something all the
time or something whether it be God
whoever the higher power yo good your
woman's intuition you know yo what if
tells you if that's for you or not and
you take that for what it is and then
you try to fix it and you try to make
the best of that because there's so many
times where I've doubted myself and
thank God these opportunities have came
back to me thank God that there's been
situations put forth where they've made
their way to me because if I would have
you know took him in in the moments that
were presented to me maybe I wouldn't
have been successful with it
maybe is there's a lot of stuff where I
think I think it was given to me earlier
in this journey I would not know how to
I couldn't take it I would I'm gonna be
honest I would have it up and I
wouldn't know where to go you know so I
believe that everything is timing
that's this video is gonna be called
timing okay
wait on your time stop looking at the
other bitches watch stop worrying about
her process his process
about what is going on in life look keep
your eyes on your watch because the only
time that should matter to you when
somebody else is advancing in the world
don't say nothing negative don't don't
think negative thoughts because that
blessing isn't yours to be mad about
that is theirs okay choose yourself like
a child stop worrying about their toys
cuz that's not yours nobody brought that
for you his mom and daddy brought that
for him God gave him that God gave her
that and you're getting yours in due
time so I will catch you guys in my
next one I hope you guys enjoyed this
sorry about the glasses and a glare but
I'm looking crazy and I'll catch you
guys in my next one peace and remember
you jack</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
