just on a roll today and my damn head
hurts we're gonna just keep it on the
road people the question I get asked the
most about what I'm doing you to which
majority is hair reviews is how to get
into doing hair reviews so I'm gonna
give you some tips that should help you
out if you're interested in going down
this route and some do's and some don'ts
to not do as a hair reviewer first make
sure that you are well-versed and
knowing about origins of hair the
process of hair and how to install hair
however if you are a person who only
gets wigs done and then you wear them
and you review them it's kind of hard to
take your opinion seriously because
there's someone else who's doing the
work and you're wearing it so you're
like a consumer to a certain degree you
know so be knowledgeable of what you're
reviewing to to get in to reviewing hair
is not very hard I fell into it because
I was doing something else and because I
always kept my own hair done I started
to wear extensions after I stopped with
my braids so it's changing my hairstyle
I decided okay I'm just gonna go in
extensions to kind of preserve my hair
and then soon as I did one review which
was my first review ever bushiness hair
emporium all of the companies just kind
of started to pour in so that was
something that I wasn't used to and I'm
just like I don't really want to go down
this Avenue but it definitely I've
learned a lot doing such so if this is
something that you're into and you
really really really are interested in
make sure that your craft is something
that you are very good at because the
thing is at the end of the day they're
companies and they want their stuff to
sell and if you are not able to make the
product look even better than it is when
you receive it then they're not gonna
get what they just gave you back they're
probably gonna send you $900 worth of
hair and they want to make that back
tenfold so even if they if they don't
make that back and then it's like you're
not doing a very good job with selling
the hair
okay that's just the honest thing you
have to make sure that the hair looks
great
our Glenn would not have sent me all of
his hair and I was sitting up here in my
hair was a frizzy scraggly mess and it
was you know after all this time it
still it's great I think that was - I
don't know two or three so three or four
be very honest okay every single review
that I put out I am 100% honest about
how I feel about the hair if I do not
like it and it is just a troublemaker
and it shit in like a dog it goes back
I'm not gonna waste my time explaining
to you guys that the hair just sucks
it's no point no thank you
if the hair has a couple of hang-ups has
a couple of things that can be approved
and proved a lot of times if you say
this in a video it will light a fire up
under the companies but to kind of fix
what is wrong and sometimes these might
be minor tweaks that are wrong but need
to be addressed because again at the end
of the day I can say that my bundles are
one thing but when the consumer receives
it and it's not a quality I still get
people telling me like y'all right the
same hair that you brought but it didn't
last like that it didn't look like that
and I'm always an advocate for always
get your money back never take something
or feel like you should have to keep
something that you don't want now it's
the difference between getting the hair
installing it putting product in it and
sleeping on it and then it mats up on
you and then you're mad at the company
because that's how personal you did that
okay now you just as soon as you get it
and you install it and by the end of the
day it's matted up behind your back
there's nothing that you could have done
unless you ran to a rainstorm and put
hella conditioner in it that is not
conditioning that you could have done to
do that so I I'm always an advocate for
get your money back even if my hair was
great if I love the hair if you don't
like it didn't get your money back and
your your audience will appreciate that
about you because you're still a person
I'm still the consumer to you never say
I buy things - so Oh Rebecca by a
macbook and is great and then I buy
MacBook and it keeps turning off on me
and it has electrical issues then that's
still not the same difference
she could have got it for free and I pay
for mine so there's the issue here and
again hair is one of those things is
very finicky and the reason is because
hair comes from different donors so
sometimes a bundle if you get four
bundles it may come from four different
people so you may have a problematic
bundle or you may have three problematic
bundles and one good one it just depends
but this is where the companies have to
do product testing and make sure that
what they're sending out is the same
you can't quality control my hair
because I'm getting as a reviewer but
then the customers getting into this
problem you know I've had an out with a
lot of companies and what I want a lot
of wig companies especially that will
not review for anymore because a lot of
you guys have came back to me and said
yo my wig didn't look like yours it
didn't last like yours it didn't do this
it didn't do that and I'm like listen I
can only dodge for myself and again you
have to make this very known
I can only say how I got my hair I can't
say how yours work
I can only say my mines so I always tell
people make sure you get three opinions
before you buy anything your opinion my
opinion and someone else's so if you're
looking for here and I'm your hair guru
I shouldn't be your your Holy Grail
because it may have been someone else
that brought the very hair that I have
in my head right now and had major
issues with it so again as a consumer
before you spend your money make sure
that you know what is what if one person
got great and the rest got bad I
wouldn't do it if it's so-so
I would look into it if everybody got
trash don't do it you know it's that's
how I look at things when I buy about
things all the time and I be like I want
to know you know what you know but as a
hair reviewer you can only do so much
you can't shoot everybody from
everything because the company's gonna
do what they want to do regardless now
they want to fix the problem
great so the next thing make sure that
whenever you are ever on camera that
your hair is laid to capacity because
nobody wants to ever see you have a bad
hair day
unless you're blocking that when you're
vlogging all bets are off but when
you're just
reviewing like I'm doing now or doing a
video and references to hair I can't
really take anybody else's opinion about
hair seriously if you're hearing done
just saying it when you come on camera
make sure that you're presentable
because again when you are working with
these companies they are looking towards
you because you're giving them a
production okay understand that you are
giving them a production so that means
hair makeup outfit backdrop light camera
all of this goes into why they want to
work with you or why they do not want to
work with you okay I started on the
floor in front of a couch I'm no longer
there so as your YouTube channel gets
bigger and whatever you're doing make
sure that you start to look around you
and make sure production value get a bit
bigger you don't always have to do a
backdrop you don't always have to do
lights but when you're representing a
company and you're representing yourself
and you're showing a actual product make
sure that the product always looks great
it never hurts
you can't sell anything if you can't see
it you can't sell anything
if people can't tell how great it is or
isn't you know so make sure that you
keep that in mind it is a production
because at the end of the day people
want to see things all the text we put
in all these lights that we have all of
the stuff seems very you get used to it
because you know when I see Malibu dog
Vince he's gonna have an intro he's
gonna you know get jiggy with it you
know you you you're expecting this but
people don't look at what actually goes
into this it's a lot of work and a lot
of times people get lazy because they
don't the hair they get lazy because
they just want to get something from
this you know but they don't want to
really put in the work you have to put
in the work to get back a great product
that's why when a lot of people like or
are you gurus get free hair we've worked
to get free hair you know I don't think
people understand we've worked hard to
get to this point where now companies
are literally throwing stuff at us and
spamming our emails because they want to
get in touch
to figure out how we can help their
brand so remember that being a hair
reviewer is more than just looking cute
being a hair reviewer is more than
saying all my hair shed it it didn't
shed you have to let the people know
well how long did you have it do you
wear weaves or do you were wigs um did
you sleep in this hair did you shower in
his hair did you get beat up in his hair
like what did you do in it you know so
that's why I have a tendency to tell you
guys like I was out like this hair for
instance let's just take this for
example I've been out since 9:30 this
morning
it is currently 12:00 midnight okay and
this hair has not been recalled I
probably brushed it once and it's still
kicking okay so you see what I'm saying
like okay so if this hairs can withstand
that I plan on going to a party I'm
going to a concert I want my hair to be
lay in my Instagram pictures I tell them
things like that like what have you done
in if you colored it what was your
experience with even if it's dark color
what was your experience with it so it
just depends but make sure that you're
very informative in what you tell your
audience and because they're gonna want
to know and your hair is laid
everybody's gonna want the hair but if
it laden is it great or is it ladies
than okay and I'm saying is the
satisfactory or is it poppin they want
to know so yeah if it's not a hard thing
to get into but it's a hard thing to
continue to do because down the line
you're gonna get to a point where
everybody in a mama wants you to review
for their hair if you're doing a great
job you're gonna see reflected in all of
your booking emails you're going to see
that and there are some people that you
just have simply have to say no to
there's some people if you use simply
can't reply to because you know they
don't get I can't do it and it's not
because I think I'm better or is it's
not because it's because sometimes like
for me personally I don't work with
smaller companies and it sounds very
rude when I say it like that but the
reason why I've done is because
everybody in a mama right now is selling
here so if a company I always require
the company to have been up for at least
six months before I take any reviews
from it the reason being is because
no company has only been out about to
come out and I do review for them and
all these people love their hair they
order and then the company's not there a
morning you notice it it has no track
work it has no history because how do i
I can't respond to people all their
money so that's how you protect yourself
that's how you protect your brand be
very smart about who you work with
because every company that's poppin
doesn't have good hair every company
that's an inexpensive doesn't have good
inexpensive hair every expensive company
doesn't have great hair so it's up to
you you still as a person you still have
a you have to be very careful with
yourself but the people that you're kind
of leaning towards these companies
because that's what I am you're the
middleman so you are the reason why
these people are saying well I loved his
hair I'm gonna go buy from this company
you know and again things happen all the
time it happened to me it happened to
other people but these things that I'm
telling you I think more kind of
foolproof have to kind of phenomenal and
kind of get through this hair gang
because everybody so in here from the
Weed Man down the street to the
housewife of the book everybody got some
virgin brazilian they trying to give you
four half off the free half off as long
as you tell somebody so um I hope that
covered a lot of your questions about
being a hair reviewer and um how this
works and all of that and I'll do a
video of like this about being a
youtuber and I'll kind of go into the
lights that i use in the camera that I
use and backdrops that I use for those
who are interested in investing in our
channel and you kind of want to make
something better and you want to get
better and you want to have a production
value that's better it's nothing wrong
with trying to be a better you so I hope
you guys really enjoyed this I hope it
was very informative if you have any
more questions make sure you put them
down below and I will catch you guys and
woman okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
