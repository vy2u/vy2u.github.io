what shampoos and conditioners do I use
them and my hair as well as my
extensions so I will do a video of like
my top part like ten favorite shampoo
and conditioners that I love so much
because um you can't use everything like
I can't use everything for these that I
use them out here and vice versa so yeah
the first two things for if you have
gray or silver hair you're going to want
to use shimmer lights because um this
stuff is for gray hair and it's for
elderly people or people who have gray
hair it helps keep the color vibrant and
bright so yeah you're gonna do this
color you probably already seen the
other video I said this already but
you're gonna use it these you need to
invest in nice because it's going to
keep your hair vibrant and stop it from
stop it from fading and you don't just
want it um the next uh shampoo and
conditioner that I love I'm gonna tell
you guys I started using this stuff back
when I was wearing brace you guys know
when I was wearing braids uh I had to
get my hair done like every two weeks
because I have really bad dandruff so I
can't keep my hairstyle for very long
because I'm had to redo it and then at
that point I just want to know him so
one thing I started using was and I
mentioned this so long ago was I think
it's called Giovanni
but Giovanni however you want to say it
or whatever but this is the tea tree
with the tea tree triple shampoo I love
these things
and his shampoos or her shampoos I'll
know if it's a man or a woman because on
the back of it it tells you like how
much moisture versus how much clarity
that you're going to get with the
shampoo and conditioner these are
normally $26 I have this this is the
conditioner this is the shampoo it has a
it's a tea tree so it has a very like
minty feel it's like you know you brush
your teeth and your teeth feels all like
clean that's how to make sure scalp
feels it tingles and all of that good
stuff these are very expensive these
were normally $26 but I was a TJ Maxx
and I found them $4.99 now you guys know
like back in the day when I had did
videos on I think my old channel about
shampoos and conditioners I use I was
using like the smaller bottles because I
couldn't find these so this is great
these works so well so if you have dry
scalp or dandruff or you know things
like that were you trying to figure out
how to get rid of it or what to use on
them those are perfect because they have
good clarifying and now different ones
they're not the only ones they have
other ones too like a one as catered
towards like moisture and stuff like
that I don't use those and then go
blow-dry my hair I don't use those um
the ones that I use in my hair and my
extensions I only use those in my hair I
don't use those on my extensions but
what I use on my hair are these which is
the organics coconut milk because this
stuff works so good on my hair my hair
like really curly and bouncy and springy
so this stuff actually does help me get
a comb through it and all of that good
stuff
but it also works on my extensions too
which I love I like these the best out
of the entire collection or Solman ears
Moroccan oil they're the argan oil
there's so many different ones but these
work the best to me because they um
moisturize and clarify but they also
don't leave your hair feeling really
greasy when you're off set and finish so
I love these for me personally because I
do have dry scalp so these do help on
the moisture side of things I've tried
other ones like the Moroccan argan oil
and it was another one I tried to and I
really didn't like it much um the next
ones and the last ones that I used were
these and I just brought a ray up on
these these are the coconut water
shampoo and conditioner if you have
children that have really curly hair and
you don't want to use anything harsh on
their hair or just for yourself in
general um these are perfect because the
water is pretty much what activates but
they is it hydrates your hair so if you
come out the pool or something you know
all that chlorine um or your hair is
just really dry from curling
or a lot of hairspray these are great
because they do what they're supposed to
do but it has like a weightless feel to
them they don't they make your hair feel
very healthy when it's all said and done
which I love so these I found these at
my local um I was at Walgreens I found
these and they were unsettling was like
buy one get one free or buy one get one
half are for it it was two for $12 or
something I don't know Walgreens always
got some good deals going on so I just
pretty much go from there but yeah those
are pretty much those are all the ones
that I use I don't use any other ones
because what happens is if I switch out
too much I just stop I forget and then
shampoo and conditioner just starts to
sit there and rot and start to smell
weird so I don't use those but yeah
those are the only ones that I pretty
much use and they always do the trick
for me for you you can try them out and
see if you like them if you don't like
them I'm sorry but yeah those are my
suggestions because I get a lot of these
messages like what are you used for your
extensions but yeah the coconut milk
always works no matter what hair I have
whether it's curly straight body wave
Indian Brazilian Eurasian it don't
matter it always works so if you have
any questions let me know
um and then I'll get back to you and I
got all of the coconut milks with all
the organics products from Target and
Walgreens the Giovanni's came from TJ
Maxx are you break from finding my Ross
to possibly I don't know and I got the
shimmer lights from Sally's the
conditioner was $12.99 and the shampoo
was $8.99 so yeah I was hot to y'all
later
and I hope God enjoyed this bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
