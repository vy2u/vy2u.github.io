thought this will be very fun so this is
the Toy Story lookbook I did based on
the new fans that just came out so these
were the woody ones so this is look one
and this is a run piece from forever 21
and these are the shoes which I'm
totally obsessed with and I'm not really
a big vans person but I thought these
were absolutely amazing I love the Andy
at the bottom of the shoe was super
duper adorable um and I just wanted to
do looks based on these looks because
Toy Story is one of my favorite Pixar
and Disney films so um the jacket is
self I've in the one piece I got from
forever 21 and the jacket has of course
Toy Story on the back which I thought
was crazy I got mine in a large cuz I
thought I wanted it to be a little bit
bigger the jacket has woody on the front
and it has like the robe and the boot
and you know the the sheriff's car which
I thought was cute this was the next
look I love these shoes and they have
Andy at the bottom too and those are
more based on his boots um you guys see
me wear this Toy Story sweaty ones
before I did it in a review so I wanted
to kind of give a bit of a different
look for all of the shoes that I used in
this one I really love this look because
it was very like down-home I have very
little makeup on so it's more of a
unisex look than just a girl look you
know I wanted to give you guys a little
bit more of an option the pants are from
the Versace hmm they're the crocodile
pants and um yeah
these are the crystal Giuseppe Zanotti I
wore these to Six Flags and I've had
them for a while but I haven't really
warm so I'm waiting to actually wear
them with this top which is a top that I
got from joy Ridge and it came with some
matching shorts so I opted to wear with
these blue glasses which the link to
these classes will be in the link below
and no pants because why you know so
this look was the bo-peep look which was
very a soft pink and I'll actually love
these guys know I have thing for the
pink so this jacket that I'm wearing is
actually from kinship which actually
made my R&amp;amp;B jacket it's like a
camouflage satin jacket the top is from
forever 21 the girl a little girls
section and I just wore some regular Oh
white pants with this and I wore the
glasses are from the same company and my
favorite way currently melody um with
some cute gold earrings you know and I
think this is a cute like everyday go
out to lunch shopping look so I was kind
of obsessed with this look this is like
my one of my favorites so this look was
these are the same giuseppe's but these
are all black and I want it because of
the top of course so I opted to do this
top which I really really like and I
just worked with some leather pants and
I did it with the wool hat as well I
just kept the wool hat with this again
it's more of a unisex I kind of wanted
to do you can wear both of these for
girls are guys which they were intended
for so you know this is really quick I
hope you guys enjoyed this and make sure
you guys thumbs up this video for more
look books to come in the future and put
down below what was your favorite look</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
