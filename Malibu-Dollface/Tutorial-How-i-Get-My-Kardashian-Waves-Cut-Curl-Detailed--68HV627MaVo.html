on how I got this very wavy Kardashian
look I've been wearing quite often
lately and I'm using my eyewear glammed
here so let's get started I started off
with six bundles of 30-inch Brazilian
straight I constructed the wig like I
usually do I'll put a link below to a
video on how I construct all my wigs
they're all the same
so here what I'm doing is I'm trying to
figure out exactly where I want the UM
where I want the pretty much the wings
the waves on the side to be so pretty
much you I say behind the ears where you
should start usually because I'm using
an 18 inch um still base closure from
that they sent me usually if I use a 16
inch the 16 inch is usually long enough
for me to know where to cut but here um
as I'm in the camera okay um here's you
see I'm just pretty much gonna cut down
the front and this pretty much is gonna
fry my face so I did a video not too far
hour back where I said you know layers
frame your face and that's why I do this
this is kind of the same thing but it's
a little more in-depth because you're
cutting a little more hair off because
you're gonna curl it so pretty much at
this particular point I'm just cutting
and curling reading a girl in cutting
and curling um is what you're gonna see
me do a lot of throughout this entire
video
know that you know
so pretty much I'm gonna continue to cut
I'm cutting like a little bit and I'm
using that as my guideline and continue
to keep cutting because eventually this
is going to end up being kind of like a
very blunt cut in a way but it's going
to be at an angle but you don't want to
cut too much off at one time because
what happens when you do that is is you
end up with a very unattractive
situation that you can't correct so here
I'm pretty much like okay I'm judging to
see how much more I need to cut off and
you also have the factor in the fact
that you're going to curl it too so it's
going to make it shorter this is a kind
of a trial and error situation if you're
not comfortable with curling your hair
or cutting your hair I would actually
just prefer you go to someone with a
picture of me or someone else and then
have them do it because if you do if you
do do this and you do this with some
very expensive hair you're gonna pretty
much be asked out and you're gonna be
pissed off that you wasted all your
money and you cut a big dent and your
beautiful Brazilian straight hair um so
yeah that's pretty much what I'm gonna
do here the front is the most important
because the front is going to let you
know it's gonna is the statement of what
your hair looks like the bottom is okay
and you can pretty much do that this
wasn't exactly the same as my other one
the other one had more layers towards
the bottom but that's because I cut that
a different way versus how I cut this
one because I heard was already cut when
I had the 34 inch so it's cut a little
different so this one I'm going to go
for more of a straighter look not so
voluminous but it's the same thing you
just cut more layers up towards the
bottom
you
so here what I'm doing is I'm taking the
part that's already been cut and I'm
kind of like thinning it out just a
little bit what this does is it allows
you to get like these little but very
pretty kind of curls
um right where it kind of folds into the
rest of the hair so it kind of gives you
this pretty little you know look or
whatever um which is beautiful um and it
just kind of helps sell the look that
it's beautiful and it's big and it's
flowy and you know there's nothing
everything is one continuous thing what
am I trying to say here yeah pretty much
that's what it is so here I'm going to
show you what the cut looks like now so
it's a basic clay that I've done before
guys there is nothing different
it's just that I'm gonna curl it
different than what I usually do so here
I'm just pretty much checking what it
looks like to make sure that it's even
on both sides so here I'm just checking
the cut and making sure that everything
is where it's supposed to be make sure
that everything is nice I just put a
little bit of heat protectant in it and
I have to go ahead and pluck this part
which I never have to do but this one I
had to do and I just went ahead and cut
the cap from underneath this one as well
before I put it on no done missing you
maybe I go beyond good
you
okay so what you're going to do here is
you're going to over direct the curl in
the front and you just make it a regular
kind of off base barrel curls just
remember that these curls are gonna when
they fall because the way you cut it
they're gonna fall in a certain way so
that's pretty much what this is up here
is that I'm just curling making sure
it's warm enough and I'm gonna do this
around the entire head you don't have to
do it in like the nape of the back you
just only have to do it towards the like
very bottom of there if that makes any
sense so yeah so that's pretty much as
you're gonna do with this whole thing
um this one I have put a lot of
hairspray in this hair because I wanted
it to hold and I had somewhere to go to
the next day so I definitely didn't want
to like have my hair fall at night
because I don't like to put flexi rods
in his hair it looks much better not the
hair but this style I tried a reflective
rock and it just makes my hair look too
tight so this the UM the curling iron
actually makes it look more natural more
voluminous and prettier in my opinion so
that's why I put so much hairspray at
the top because I was trying to make
sure that the closure stayed down
because again it was a little bit used
if you watched my review you'll know
what I said I said it was a little puffy
and I'm not used to my closures kind of
being a little bit thick and I think
it's because of the density is the way
that it was manufactured all the hair
was put in so close together that it's
not really easy for it to lay down so I
got it to lay down as much as I could
but you know so that's what I'm doing
here in the front it doesn't have to be
perfect by a long shot
because only you're going to do with
brush these out you just want them to
cool and set a certain way so that when
you go ahead and rush them out and you
want your fingers through it and go a
certain way so in the front which you're
going to do is you're going to curl them
towards your face then when you get
towards here to the back you start
curling them away from your face that
way the hair and the front goals they
over direct themselves around your face
and then the hair that's behind you it
goes away from your face so it looks
like this big wave when you look at it
setting once you brush it out it looks
something like this and then that piece
you'll run your fingers through and
it'll do what my hair will do towards
the end of the video
now remember earlier when I told you
don't cut too much off because you might
have to go back and check something and
that's exactly what I did here so as you
can see this part is too long so I'm
just pretty much going through and I'm
just trimming off what is too long and
what's gonna make you know it's not
gonna look its cute if that's all the
way because my hair will keep falling in
the front if I don't chop this off so
that's pretty much what I'm doing here
and I'm doing it in light layers that's
why I seem like it's taking me forever
just to make sure that it's the one it's
not blunt to it flows right and it lays
like it's supposed to
okay so here's what this is what your
finished product should look like
somewhat so you see how they pretty much
cascade down but they're there go away
from your face in the front and then
they come towards you in the back that's
pretty much what you should get the look
of towards the end um and it's a heart
it's very simple if you're okay with
cutting this should be actually okay
because this is a simple version then I
just simply put it on and I just went
back here and this was from today and I
was just recalling my hair because you
know doing that right here never do this
um but yeah make sure you guys check out
my review for this particular hair this
