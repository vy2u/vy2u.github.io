but much thinner but anyway I'm gonna
unbox this because I know what this is
and this is my Aaliyah one-in-a-million
like certified or RIAA plaque and I
remember me give you a little backstory
you guys know I love Lea this is why
this picture is in here if you guys know
me from my myspace days and like back in
the day I had her plastered over my
entire room she's always been an
inspiration that's why my hair is always
everything nothing less than laid
because hers was never that so um
hers was never not laid that's what I
mean not you know whatever anyway um
this is a certified plaque for one a
million this baby is big and I wanted to
do this on camera because I remember
I'll open it as I talk maybe that'll
work
I remember when I was younger and seeing
her own hell it might have been teen
summit I don't even I don't remember but
she I got are like a certified plaque
for two million over two million sold
for one in a million you know what I
mean is my favorite album like ever
because that's when she broke out of her
shell and did what she loved and yeah
I'm was amazing so I decided as a thing
because you know I will open this on
camera because it would be you know a
cool thing to do if I can ever get this
bitch open so I just was randomly on
eBay I'm I'm an ebay stalker and I was
looking for a broken and actual teeth a
certified TLC plaque because I wanted to
get her one for her birthday and ran
into this and lost my entire mom away
came off a yeah so um it was from
auction house I don't know how they got
it but it was issued to her uncle and I
had to have it it was about three
hundred and something was shipping and
everything but
it was a struggle to get it open cuz my
ass is stupid I'm informative in a lot
of ways with a lot of ways I'm not I
just to see this in person is amazing so
thank you to the people I brought this
for the auction house I got it from so
they pack this puppy very nicely this
box was just real extra dope but it
ain't broke so that's a good thing okay
before I take it out the classic this is
how big it is okay these are the
original plastic still on it
this is like the best thing since sliced
bread oh my god I might to lose my mind
this is amazing this is it's presented
to her uncle scary Hankerson look Oh
Casey no there you go and this was
presented to him to commemorate the
multi-platinum sales of more than 2
million copies of the black ground
entertainment slash Atlantic record
album cassettes and CDs are one in a
million I just want to say as an alia
fan this is like the holy grail of
everything oh my it's not have the
original plastic still on it which is
great it has two looks in the back and
it has the watermark everything so I
just wanted to show you guys this and oh
my goodness in my new apartment I cannot
wait to put this up but shout out to all
the Aliyah fans I had to do this cuz
this is the moment I just can't believe
I have this I remember Stan as a kid her
getting this and to be able to have one
even though it's not to me it's not to
me it's her - her uncle but that makes
it even better even though he crazy that
makes it even better so yeah um thank
