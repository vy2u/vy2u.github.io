been asking me numerous questions about
this hair I have in that looks really
nice
today it's very sylco fide and this is
of course it's my Sheena Harry Emporium
hair I've had this hair in for I think
on the 11th it'll be two months I've had
this hair in and I told you guys that my
goal is to reach three months but it's
looking like I'm gonna be taking this
out and installing some different hair
for Halloween so I don't know I want to
keep this hair in because my layers and
everything are cut so nicely and oh no I
don't know I haven't made up my mind yet
because I really do not want out to take
this hair out like I'm really just I'm
in love like I love his hair so a lot of
people were asking me numerous questions
that I did not answer in my initial
review of this hair the reason why I
have not done like a two week or three
week a month because I don't feel this
necessary I do videos pretty often where
you guys can actually see the hair and
you would see if the hair is looks any
different to me the hair looks better
than it did when I first got it like oh
I just huh I just love this hair y'all
like I just love it so yeah um I have in
24 a bundle of twenty four twenty
eighteen and sixteen but I did see
scheana on Twitter and she was tweeting
about the inch length and I didn't know
she went up to like longer lengths then
I think I thought she only went up to 24
obviously not so we had talked and she
sent me some more hair so I have two
bundles of more this mind you this is
the Indian curly hair that has been
straightened but she sent me two more
bundles this is a 26 yes she's gonna be
two bundles of 26 so as you can see
dodge so Jojo I can't wait to put this
in I mean this 24 is pretty long
it stops right here so my is about the
Barbie Lane the Barbie Lane
so yeah I'm gonna install business
install as well as people are asking
about my closure and this is the closure
that I was saying which is also been
straightened so let's see if this
matches what I got poppin off actually
yeah well your straighten correctly you
can't tell oh okay so yeah I am I'm
going to definitely put the closure in
as you guys see I bleached the top and I
need to go in and fix some stuff because
you know I I never bleached the closure
before you know this is always been my
clothes you're my heir you know but yeah
I love this hair um am I get it any
shedding I did not steal my whips and I
purposely did not sell my lips because
usually when I do clients hair if they
want to know if it's good hair or not or
if it's um you know like what kind of
hair it is always some don't steal them
and then wear the hair and see what
happens and then you know if it's if
your shares a little bit or whatever
still them you know when your next
install so my hair does shed a little
bit and the reason is because this is
how the hair is it only sheds when I
wash it and it's like this when I wash
it because of course naturally is curly
hair and curly hair is gonna you know
it's gonna shit because it tangles a
little bit it's not crazy or anything
like it's just is how my regular hair X
so I'm used to it I use like a paddle
brush like this in order to you know you
know go from the ends and we go you know
all the way out to get the situation I
used swabs I forgot with shampoo and
conditioner I'm using right now but it's
suave and it's the humectant nothing a
swabs essentials I think it's what i'm
using i'm using that along with you know
my regular effigy products and it's some
organic products as well just some
what's the name milk coconut
yeah coconut milk i'm using for this
hair or whatever the hair is the most
great um
and like I said I got she's gonna be two
bundles of 26 I don't know how I'm gonna
fit 26 bundles
I mean 26 damn I don't know how I must
fit two extra bundles in here I actually
have some space in the back I might try
the neck technique next so I could put
more tracks in or whatever but like I
said I'm not one to put tracks at the
top because that's how your weave
actually stays looking natural if you
don't put tracks that many tracks at the
top you want this to look as natural as
possible back here you can you crazy
with it it don't matter you get real
crazy with it but as you can see this
hair is really flowy it gives me no
tangles and like I said it doesn't right
up the battle my back of my neck like
pack hair oh god that is the worst what
else the beards on the wefts are not bad
at all they're actually very short if in
some of these two bundles don't even
have any I mean if they do is very
minimal um
I don't get like my hair fight if I
leave it like this or but I blow dry it
it curls back right back up like this
hair looks like this hair every time I
wash it and condition it I did a video I
don't know if I'm gonna insert the video
into this video but I did a video with
this is what the hair looks like after a
fresh shampoo and condition there's no
other products in the air at this point
this is exactly what it looks like and
once it dried the crew gets a little bit
tighter and that's it okay so I just got
out the shot when I was you seen in a
previous clip I had told you I was gonna
blow dry it but you seen what it looked
like when it was curly this is what if
expect when I did like a rough blow-dry
over it it still may be a little damp in
some areas but you know for the most
part it's still you know it's still good
it says that ripple Lanie which has to
come out with the flat iron but you know
it's not gonna hurt
so yeah this video what it looks like
when it's wet and with
like when it's you know dry if there's
been blow-drying or whatever a lot of
people are asking me like what are you
gonna wear it curly I had every
intention and wearing a curly and then I
fell in love with the movement and the
bounce of this and then the curling is
kind of went out the door you know but
I'm not really a curly hair person the
purpose of me getting curly ears because
when you do blow dry his hair it looks
very natural so if I want to go out with
a afro I can and nobody really could
tell that I got to leave you know that's
that's kind of like the point um and I
just like that natural hair look because
when you have straight hair or even body
wave here when you wet it is just
stringy and straight it doesn't do
anything so I'm going for more of a
natural look with this here um so yeah I
love the hair like and you guys know I'm
not really for the BS when it comes down
to certain things if I don't like
something then I'll let you know off the
bat that I do not like it at all it does
just it is what it is but and this hair
was actually I did not pay for this hair
for those who I skinned I personally did
not pay for this hair this hair was sent
to me to do review I'm doing an honest
review of how I feel about the hair I
cut the layers in myself
my hair's always I did a few like in the
front to frame my face when I first got
it and then I just went back in and
really chopped it up up um which to me
whenever you get a weave done if you if
you are we doesn't frame your face or
herb looks to be as if it's been cut it
doesn't look natural it doesn't look
like it's yours it just looks like you
got in some tracks so you know don't be
afraid to cut they have every possible
thing I got the Korea clip they got
everything that you could use in order
to get a nice decent clay in your hair
today so you know why not um what else
that I was gonna say the questions I've
been getting axed am i oh somebody asked
me am I having any uh problems with
wrapping it because it's so long I think
I'm gonna do a hair wrap tutorial like
how I wrap my hair at night because I
usually wrap it two ways I'll wrap it
like leave it like this and then just
wrap the top of it and I'll be okay and
then
put a bonnet on when I get in the shower
or I'll do the crisscross man thing
which I don't know if anybody's familiar
with when you part your hair down the
middle in the back and you you basically
crisscross it and you clip it around the
side and then you wrap it but out I'll
give you guys thumbs up this video if
you want me to do a tutorial on or right
at the bottom I wanna wrap power at my
hair tutorial you know um some people
ask me how did I get all of my hair in
my beehive without my hair looking bulky
well one thing that you guys can do that
I didn't take pictures of but one thing
I always do and I usually do this some
people with a when I do here would have
a lot of hair is that you take you put
two beehives one because it's less
painful and two it's easier to get a lot
of hair on one person's head no matter
the size so what you usually do is you
put a beehive here and you put a beehive
here and I usually connect at the bottom
but you put two here because you put
you're putting more hair the you know
I'm saying you put two more you got
enough space to put a lot of hair and
then you and I always put one track I
mean one braid around the perimeter at
the top so that is your blending track
if that made any type of sense but yeah
that's what that's what I have and
that's basically how you get more and it
helps you with more hair because you
have you of course you're braiding
smaller so you can get more tracks on
one instead of having to always double
because sometimes when you double your
tracks it causes your hair to look bulky
in the back depending on who's doing it
cuz some people can sew it incorrectly
or sometimes people who do they all here
guys old incorrectly I don't know um so
yeah it's it's holding up really well
it's been almost two months and I've
washed and conditioned this hair like
five times already and redid it and it's
giving me no problems and impaired to me
that's problematic gotta go and this
hair would have been out had this been
an issue for me or if it was shedding or
if it was hair all on the floor and you
guys know I got in four and a half
bundles and my hair is still very full
and you know if if I was shedding
it would be a problem right now y'all
feel like you look a little thin from
that first video so yeah it's um it's
great I love it there's nothing else I
can say about it Sheena's hair emporium
is the best the only thing that people
also keep asking me is how to order the
hair a lot of you guys have already
gotten your hair and ordered your hair
she's having issues with the site the
merchant account I'm assuming I mean
don't quote me on it because I don't
know I only I can't speak for the
company but they're I'm put the email at
the bottom if you email her she's very
prompt and responding to you and you
know getting you what she wants she does
a lot of um she loves a lot of customer
appreciation where they give out free
hair and they give out free products and
stuff on Instagram for people who
purchased hair from her before so it's a
great company they're very prompt and
replying to you and you know getting the
best hair for you and they're very
affordable you know this is a really
nice hair that would have ran me $1200
had I went anywhere else you know it
around me anything but I'm just saying
if I was looking an industry and the
interest of buying hair and I really
needed some good hair and this was my
option this hair would have cost me a
fortune but her hair she has very good
prices you know people are really so
nice you slap any and Brazilian
Mongolian Filipino on anything then the
price just shoots up like giraffe pussy
and you just it's just ridiculous
so they're very affordable they're very
it's like a family environment you know
because if I ever need something like oh
this is that any other you know they
they give me no issues you know it's
just like okay cool listen it's our you
know problem and I'm not saying that
every company who just doesn't sing you
what you want is a bad company not at
all but I'm just saying it's very rare
there's a lot of hair companies that are
out here and I've heard horror stories
about how they got in hair and the hair
was matted in the back and they only had
it for this amount of time but to their
defense people when you buy this type of
hair remember its is maintenance that
has to go into it this is not Indira me
this is not jazz wave this is not velvet
hair this is Indian virgin Indian hair
so therefore you have the
like human hair this is not processed
pack hair bad you know you can let you
can lay on it and it's going to be okay
if you don't take care of it it probably
will go to hell really quick so you know
I wrap my hair every single night
because I don't want to get up with
creases in my hair I don't want to get
up in my hair doesn't flow anymore and
it's not it doesn't do this anymore and
it's just write it like this to the side
you can't do that you know so sometimes
if you see people with bad hair or bad
reviews a lot of times your stuff comes
from them not doing what they're
supposed to do and treating the hair
like it's $80.00 hair when you just
spent 180 dollars on a bundle just
saying though so yeah um any other
questions that you guys have pertaining
to this hair just let me know and I will
be more than happy to answer any of your
questions but yeah I can't wait to put
this 26-inch
yeah it is gonna be a problem so yeah um
again is Sheena's hair emporium I'm
going to leave the link down below and
I'm trying to think before I go is there
anything else I need to say about this
hair only I can say is I love it that's
just it and it blends so greatly with my
hair like it's just it's just it's just
it's just beautiful ladies this is what
your hair should look like okay this is
what your hair should look like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
