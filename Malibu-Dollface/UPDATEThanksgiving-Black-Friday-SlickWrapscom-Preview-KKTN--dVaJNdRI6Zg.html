from a different area but recently we
just got new furniture and carpet I know
everything so the house the like
somebody picked it up and then dropped
it so um I'm gonna be broadcasting from
different areas of the house Oh until
everything is put back where it should
be um so yeah I'm basically here to just
basically do an update so you guys won't
feel like I lift you um and today guys
was to come from on my channel or
whatever I'm happy Holidays to everybody
i know christmas is coming thanksgiving
just passed and i had a really good
thanksgiving i got to see my grandmother
i haven't seen in so long like i haven't
seen since i was like how like 14 15
probably i'm so it's really good to see
her she has not changed one bit she's
still the same that she's always been
and i was really good um to see i got to
see my little cousins i haven't seen
since they were little and they are all
taller than me now so you know that was
a little sad on my part like I'm always
the short one you know I'm only 5 foot 4
so yeah um yeah so thanksgiving was
great me and broken actually went to UM
we went to black friday for what after
thanksgiving and let's see I they'd most
stories in our leg I don't know about
everywhere else but most stores in La
start opening at 12 not like nine the
next morning like they usually do they
stay over the slope and we went I left
my grandmother's house about about 8 30
so we got there around nine and um i'ma
say we got a pretty good spot although
it seemed very lengthy due to the simple
fact that the line was like a long
but um we were in a decent like line
broke he needed a new router and
external hard drive I needed a TV
because I just got new furniture for my
room so I was just like you know I think
I need to get a new like a new flat
screen because every other rooming house
has a flash furniture for my room
because I was like I'm not gonna get it
into our move it's no point but seems
like a new furniture is like I might as
well get a new TV because the TV i had
had the ass in the back you know the big
booty in the back I'm not doing anything
so I was like I want a TV that TV i had
was like a 30 inch TV so i wanted a 24
inch TV something a little bit smaller
but since it would be a flat screen and
wouldn't look that big of a difference
from the TV already had plus I needed a
TV what better clarity because nothing
was wrong with the booty TV but it still
wasn't in HD Oh series in HD so I was
like I didn't HGTV so I seeing y'all I
got a good deal I seen it they had a
dynex TV um for only it was originally
229 dollars I got a TV for eighty
dollars okay and I was in the back of
the line I hot this TV around best buy
for almost an hour after broken ass cuz
she was whipping and dipping through the
out like we wasn't in like if you guys
ever been to LA you guys know what four
or five gridlock traffic looks like
seriously so I was like okay you know
whatever we stood in line like the lines
were in the owls of where they sold
stuff like it was so many people we were
in line for like two hours just for what
she get external hard drive in TV but it
was worth it because I'm glad I didn't
have to pay that two hundred and
twenty-nine dollars for the MTV 80 bucks
i think it was like 88 something with
tags i don't remember but yeah so that
was good um so black friday was worth it
really stood in line for like an hour
and a half so wasn't bad as I thought it
was gonna be like I've done previous
years seriously um so yeah that was good
I have a lot of new videos coming
actually I'm doing a review coming up on
this particular mod for my phone which
is not a mod really I guess you could
say but it's from
company called slick wraps cigarettes
com slic k WR aps com um I contacted
them because I know when I did the lux
addiction review a lot of the guys were
asking me like do you guys do you have
any cases for guys like the Mario case
still with Stoops too sparkly for you
know 30 dudes so and then just people
who are not as flashy as me and some
other subscribers so this particular my
from my phone is actually it's a vinyl
skin that is precision cut for your
phone and they have it for the evo they
have it for your ipod on your iPad and I
asked them to send me a few different
ones because i'm going to do a full
review on this but i've had this on my
phone for about I guess you could say
like two weeks um and nothing's happened
actually I've messed it up around like
here I don't know if you can see but I
messed it up because of the simple fact
that I am I put my Mario case over it
when I went on vacation I just came back
from vacation about a week ago um it's
for those who follow me on twitter
facebook you guys know was gone um but
that's the reason why I messed it up
because they kind of clamped it down but
I had them send me two different covers
covers colors this is the vivid color
the two um this is the pink and this is
the yellow and I just use the yellow
strip and the pink on the front on the
front and the back um for it so looks
like i have a pink and yellow iphone
which really i have whiteland um and
they have glow-in-the-dark like this too
so i'll be doing a full review on these
but if you guys are looking for
christmas gifts like right now and you
guys won't know what to get someone this
is perfect this arm particular material
is outdoor material so it lasts you up
to six years so it's not going to peel
it's not going to bend it's not going to
snap it's not going to break its not
gonna fade um I guess how much it is you
know 11 done if you want to it's going
to be $22 because of course you have to
buy two silver ones in order to get the
double color but if you just want
and they come in blue green orange um
yellow of course pink um they have the
glow-in-the-dark series where they glow
in the dark so if you left the club I
guarantee that was the first series
which I am very excited about because I
like fur but I like faux fur because I
don't like hurting animals so yeah i'll
be doing a full review on the ones they
see me they sent me these they sing with
the glow in the darkness and they send
me the steelseries which actually all of
their like carbon steel all those
actually have a texture that feels like
what it's supposed to be it's not flat
but this is flat because it's only what
color oh my god no air bubbles
everything fit perfectly except for my
auntie put this on for me and she put it
on correctly when I put it on one I
didn't get it you see I was like a
little offset right there at the bottom
okay it's not supposed to do that it's
precision cut but i was i did in like
two minutes if I said what it took a
little bit more time I'm sure to look a
little bit better but um yeah two weeks
having took it off and it looks just
like this ms no pilling know anything so
i will do a forward view for slick rocks
thank you for everybody as slick wraps
um for sending me this so i could do a
review for you guys because I know you
guys are not all into the flashy cases
um horse cases that are expensive you
know so I'm trying to basically work
with in everybody's / g because we all
in a recession um so yeah I also wanted
to say you guys guys some of you may or
may not know but I am a attic for the
sims I love the same shot anyone
understand i love the sims and right now
if you guys are looking for expansion
packs for the sims if you go to gamestop
com they have a buy-one-get-one-free
sale so I just brought generations and
got pets for free so um yeah so if
you're looking for those are looking for
gifts for people who love the sims that
is perfectly because normally you would
pay six dollars per game part expansion
pack well no you would you pay forty
dollars because they're taking a dollar
so yeah 39 hours for two games can't
beat that um what else did I need to
tell you for those who keep asking me am
I going to watch this season of Kourtney
and Kim Take New York yes I am watching
I'm watching on this season and I will
have a full review on um I probably
would do a review every five episodes to
kind of put everything together to kind
of give my own my feedback on the show
when I kind of feel about it in the
divorce since I have such a big opinion
about the divorce um kind of see what's
going but did you guys see how she acted
when he stepped on her to him oh my god
manicure you always do that you're still
looking rough Layton she's really
annoying at times I love Kim but she's
just she's very extra um to say the
least so yeah uh I think that's about it
I'll have the reviews for um this case
I'm going to take this one off and also
before I even go since this is two cases
if since i didn't use all the parts to
other two i can reverse this so this
will be yellow and this will be pink and
that's like another case so basically
kind of got two cases you get it but you
don't have you can get solid colors you
can get my own one colors and make it
all pink if you like or purple or green
or blue or red um this is endless so go
to slick raps com I'll put the
information at the bottom to this
particular one so you can see what you
like they have videos on here they have
used to channel which is labrats calm
for those whose going to ask my necklace
is from it's from NBC's closet com I'm
sorry done I'm a little rusty um the
necklace part this actual necklace is
from Beauty on blast 101.com and so is
this watch so if you guys are looking
for gifts these are great independent um
vendors who are their own bosses and
they basically do everything themselves
so it's great to support other people
who are actually doing their own thing
themselves so check them out everything
is inexpensive I'm sure it's within your
Christmas budget and i'll be back next
week with a review for this and some
other stuff too and for those who keep
asking me about
sir will and broken they will be back I
promise before the year ends we just put
everybody working and getting things
together it's just like we can never see
if we do go out is at night and no one's
trying to do videos head night so yeah
other than that I hope you guys had a
great time great very great time and
that's right it I know this video was
kind of dry but I'm just not in my
element you know yeah no I'm just buying
my element what I'm used to you know um
let's see what else could I will did I
want to touch on him I think that was it
that was it I'm still as crazy as ever
it's cold and I let go yeah it's gloomy
as hell today I don't know what the
issue is but it's really cool in me um
