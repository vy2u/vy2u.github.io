footage of me uh before I was on the
phone or whatever but um the footage of
this video is going to be reversed
because I did my part on the other side
but I was not pleased by how it looked
into the camera like the viewfinder so
if everything is a little backwards your
be fine girl
you'll yah be alright but anyway enjoy
okay so this is okay first off do you
guys like this color because let me tell
you something I couldn't think I like
anything more than my little a balloon
smoke bomb
but then this came along and Holly came
along what was I get to the hair and
then get to the color thanks cuz I know
a lot of you guys are like what color
that so this is the Peruvian body wave
from you amazing hair and let me just
let me let me make something very clear
really quick because it's about the
shock y'all cuz it shocked me I only use
two bundles two bundles y'all know I
don't girl my minimum is four so two
bundles and a frontal and it came out
exactly like I envisioned it which is
crazy sometimes it looks is more I had
my frontal Esprit plus before I got it
and then also my bundles had came
obviously in the classic um s pattern
for of the body ways so I wanted to do I
think like years ago I did a video
saying I wanted to be like a ginger but
I wanted to be like an authentic ginger
I don't want to be too red and I don't
want to be too orange
I wanted me to be right in the middle so
I went on this hunt because actually I'm
going to do this color again or
a completely different texture and I
needed to find like some type of ginger
color so what I did was I went to the
hood because you know I love my husband
supply shout-out to all y'all cause
y'all know I love the good old hood so I
got this color in the door which is
number 46 in this spice amber so it's
this color so it's like hmm I want to
say like a brownish color it's like a
lighter brown color it's a good chestnut
if you will and then I got this color
which is number a door number 30 which
is just simply ginger so it's this one
so I just use all three of these and
actually I have a little bit of this
spice amber left what I did was I took
this and I did like two to one part so
I'll put twice as much a ginger and then
I just put a one part amber and I mixed
it and I did my entire head what I like
to do when I do colors is I don't like
to do just one color because it all
looks flat so if you look in the front
of my hair it looks like it's ginger but
when you look to the side like here then
all back here it's more of a darker
color so it gives you variation because
of underneath this is something I did I
thought was fun it's actually like a
reverse ombre so it's like darker here
and then it comes out longer
well it comes at the bottom it's the
actual color that is here so it's not
gonna be something kind of cool I wanted
to just try to see so if I was ever to
like curl this it would be you know it
would be kind of cute I didn't want it
to be really really sure because if I
ever wanted to curl this I would hate to
I just I like my bobs short but I don't
like them super short like this is like
shoulder length this works just fine for
me and you know I think it's real cute
this is a real sexy and whatnot you know
so I use these through these two colors
but I use these three bottles so I'll
show you here what my fronts will look
like after I went ahead and bleached it
it's so color pretty darn well except
for one of my bundles was not happy
hence why don't have to sew one of both
of these bleach find my
bleech fine but that one model no way no
no I didn't take a picture of it it
stood away because it was no but that
one didn't that wouldn't make it but
these two were fine my frontal was fine
I'll get a close-up so you guys can see
the color the variation of color so I
bleached it pretty close to I mean it
wasn't a 613 but it was the cousin it
would like of six countries okay it's
almost there but I was like I don't want
to kind of take this hair to the brink
because it is processed in this body
wave texture so that means that it has
something else on it and sometimes when
you mix processing the bleach so give
that sort of environment but I was like
come and see what happens if I do two
bundles and see how it turns out and see
how I like it and I really do mess with
it like for real
I select an around the way type of girl
with no babies and still in college
doing my thing but all those who do
think I'm real cute or whatever and you
know I got my nice little spice amber
with a darker up underneath ah you know
just for a little pop of color a little
bit of fun and what not so flat ironing
weirdly little de school I didn't really
want to say to stress at first so I went
over and like I did an initial Flatirons
impressed and then probably right after
I did it the first time I did it again
and I haven't put any heat on it ever
since I used my heat protectant um to do
so yes good this is real HD this is real
stupid
I love this color and I love how to
compliments my skin tone so well so I
give them for this grading process
I'll give him a b-minus just because I
don't know what was going on with my
third bundle like I really didn't but
the fact that this color was my hair was
originally a 1b when I got it and I was
able to lift it to the color that I
showed you guys and then I was able to
deposit this color on it and then my
hair actually still does this and it
actually moves sin hair was pretty much
taken from this to that and it still is
hidden like this and like that and I
just be careful with the timing of the
bundles and watch them you know i'ma say
that it was me because I left that one
on for the longest I must say so I could
I didn't really pay too much attention I
don't know what I was doing during that
time but I was so into don't want you
Empire so that's the only thing I will
say other than that this hair I love I
do I really and I love this color I
don't want to do this color for the
longest time y'all and tourmaline I
got to do it so again I use adores
ginger to parts in every amber one part
and I mix it and I got this color I have
a lace frontal that actually bleach
really good as you guys seen in the fall
it's bleach so well and I love this this
is about to be my summer color
I don't vitamin C low key like if me and
Chuckie have the same hue of homeland
kind of oh my god it's really close
oh cool this is really there's a little
more red in it but we come a cousin
Chuck oh okay okay good Louise LaRue um
so yeah if you guys are interested make
sure you guys hit the links below and I
will catch y'all and I'm next lunch I
can be hard to please God
it's Alesi this chucky this is the seed
of Chucky doll
he got more like it kind of the same but
he's got more like a former amber into
it you know like there's some more amber
than ginger in it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
