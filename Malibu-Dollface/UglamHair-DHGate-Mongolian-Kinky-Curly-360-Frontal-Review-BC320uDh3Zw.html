you is just I gotta deal with local
speed you know I can have to do hello
you know I love me some good thick
ignant hair yes I do
so I'll told just I know the black
posted below so a same place for the
earrings and the windbreaker is from
forever 21
okay so this hair is from a DHgate
company called you glam hair I have in a
for 26 inches this is true I didn't cut
anything and I have also have in a 360
console that is 22 inches or that's why
stops here compared to the 26 okay now
this is what I was talking about why I
said there's a way to make your curly
hair and your wavy hair still match
without it looking straight as hell at
the roof okay because all the hair
pullers cuz I could be lying
this is all the hair pulled forward so
what I did was this hair has been washed
more time and I've used this conditioner
which is my Tresemme moisture rich as my
grandmother with
moisture this who does a trick every
single freaking time so what I did was
after I went ahead and washed it I
washed it with warm water I like to use
a clarifying shampoo and then I like to
use a very moisturizing shampoo and what
um
clarifying usually just gets like
whatever may still be in the hair out
but you also don't you just clarify this
because you will end up with a nice net
fall so don't do that then you want to
condition the hell out of your hair to
make sure that it looks nice and
beautiful and lustrous like this and
it'll you know have this nice look when
you're done okay when your hair is wet
and you fit it on your mannequin head
then you want to take a blow-dryer of
your choosing this is my witness is my
eye on whisper-quiet light which is a
damn lie this thing is pretty loud so I
don't know what they would what they
using over there at ion but it ain't no
quietness
and I use a diffuser and I don't know if
a lot of people know what it is user is
for but this diffuses the water out of
your hair after you after you wash it in
your condition it and you use it I like
to use mines on a warm setting you take
it while your hair is wet and you just
literally punch it through all of the
hair is was completely dry then you're
going to end up with a look that looks
like this in the past so guys for those
who don't have a decision which you can
also do is dry your hair upside down the
thing with that is takes longer to dry
because the hair isn't it's still kind
of just sitting in its own juices
so you don't really necessarily want to
do that as you don't have suppose you do
have a diffuser for your blow-dryer you
can do this message and you'll get this
look I'm gonna do a video on this
because I think a lot of people are slow
confused on how this works but it does
make a big difference in your hair and
on top of that if you don't have a
diffuser that came with it you can
always go to sell it and buy one this
one actually came with it and it's a
lying-ass eye on a whisper light but it
does work I love this
my new favorite blow-dryer my t3 ones I
have which is for my that came from the
bar collection I use those as well but I
love this one for this look so this is
the four bundles that I have been so
dead again this is a lot of hair for an
average person this is a lot of freaking
hair for the average person however for
review reasons and dramatic reasons in
my dramatic reasons I wanted to be able
to show you guys what it would look like
if you did have four bundles the summer
is upon us so therefore this is great
pool hair imagine this with a cute
little one piece or two pieces and I
know how good you feel about your body
you know you dip in the water it's great
when it comes down to actually getting
it wet it just has it's gonna droop it's
going to pull you know like hair does
because the water obviously makes it
swell and then it gets heavy but it's
aside from that so I haven't had any
major issues with this this is my hair
and hair this is also my cute
after-hours hair but y'all know what I
mean you know something that you don't
have to pay a lot of attention to
I can literally throw this on and go
about my day I don't have to be
committed to you know strain here all
the time so this would be this piece
right here this would be like what it
looks like before I diffused it and all
that this would have looked like if it
was just way so as you can see it's
gotten bigger since it's definitely got
more body to it you don't have to wear
since this is because I just keep
running my fingers through it so it's
just going to get bigger and bigger and
bigger as you start to separate a lot of
the curls in the hair it is true kinky
curly hair so be careful with the amount
of product that you put in it because
you don't want to overwhelm the hair and
you don't want to put it in the
situation where now it has a lot of
product in it because the product also
can make it starts to get very nappy and
very tangled and it's going to cause a
lot of shading issues so to the shadings
unfortunately I have more shedding than
I would have liked with this
and it's only only get this sharing
issue when the hair is wet when the hair
is dry I don't deal with this is only
when it's wet do I start to have a nice
amount of shading that comes so I'm
going to take that as the fact that I
did cut my web so we're gonna we're
going to play this by your people that's
the like I wanted it to be a slightly
Mille we can't tell because of the fact
that it's so big you still don't want it
to be big on top of big and then it just
looks like you have on a big wig you
don't want to do that now the frontal
you can you know have parking space up
and through here I just didn't
necessarily using just because for this
look I just wanted it to be huge and big
so a part wasn't a define part wasn't
necessary so sudden one like this and
that's what it did so again this is what
I did when I think I'm going to use this
here a tutorial as tutorial hair feeding
I could think back to what I do because
I know a lot of times what happens is
curly hair is usually the most
problematic here for people who do not
know what they're doing this is a lot of
maintenance people so if you think
you're going to buy this hair and it's
going to be easy breezy because I'm
wearing it like this and I said that
it's my sir on here yeah for me it is
because I know how to take care of it
just make sure you use a good hydrating
shampoo I mean I'm Rebecca but a good
hydrating conditioner all conditioner
swab that's a dollar does not hydrate
anything okay that is equivalent to
putting some lotion on it's the
difference between baby magic and
Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson is just saying that
beg magic will keep you nice and action
so if I was you guys the best advice I
could give you guys as far as
moisturizing shampoo go and moisturize
the conditioner is the moisture which
from Tresemme this stuff is bad this
whole bottle I think it's about five
dollars okay just man giving me no
points for all this promotion but I will
say it does work and it's very
inexpensive as opposed to Sebastian's or
you get the Paul Mitchell brand this is
a great alternative this will save your
hair you have to just make sure that you
hydrated and you give it enough time if
you feel like your hair is getting
Archy if you feel like your hair is
getting tangled and you feel like your
hair is going to knot up in a ball take
your wig off
take your bundles out put it in a ziploc
bag top it up with this put it in the
microwave for at least two to three
minutes watch the heat but you want it
to penetrate once you rinse that hair
with cold water this should have helped
all of that Tang gonna set you were
having issues with so if you got any old
hair just laying around it you think is
just kind of filling and try this it's
$5 a ziploc bag and the your microwave
we all have them try it and see what
happens so I will say that's the only
con that I've had with this hair is the
fact that it does shed when quite a bit
when it's wet when it's dry as you can
see I'm completely hind I don't have any
issues I can run my fingers through it
and I just run my fingers and I just go
ahead and run my fingers through and
it'll be it'll be cool if if comm is
collected it's not napping up on me is
cool but you just have to be sure to
detangle your hair and make sure that
you do it in sections are not to pull
and make sure that your hair is ready
this hair is definitely been processed
okay this is not the original texture of
this here it is there's definitely been
process to say uniform like this so
because it has been some type of process
which you want to do is you want to make
sure that's detangle your hair or you're
going to end up with a big ol ball and
you want to say that is the company's
fault and because you've been wearing it
for two months and now it's all such as
bad people sometimes as the company
sometimes is just you and your lack of
knowledge so I'm trying to get y'all
trying to drop some gems on y'all let
y'all know what it be like you so if you
guys are interested in this hair from
use the lam hair over there at DHgate
then i'll put the link for this below
this is a 360 union but this is way too
much hair for me to try to put in a bun
up any sort like period it looks stupid
it looks dumb it's so unnecessary
because it's just a big mop of a mess
the only way that this will work is that
you literally calm all this hair on it
with a big afro and then you decided to
put in like a natural bun which I'm not
going to do because again that causes
tangling that causes pulling
Klose shooting so I wouldn't do that if
I was you but it is a very nice 360 unit
I do like it I do like the frontal very
much it did come with some nice baby
here in it but it's just very very cool
you know and when it's wet it's like
this but it's just more so on the
uniform side and then once I use the
diffuser then the diffuser gives it back
its life and its body and that whole
thing so I feel very 80s and our low
keys I feel like a Rashida from Love &amp;amp;
Hip Hop Atlanta which is a massive piece
and by the way no I do reviews so I'll
put the links below and I will catch
y'all in my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
