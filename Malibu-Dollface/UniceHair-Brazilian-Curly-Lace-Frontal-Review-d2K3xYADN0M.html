don't have to be on a finger to have to
be hello that's what I want to do ossama
forehead feels being insulted yeah
okay so we gonna go to my my tresses
later essence which is from a unitary
chick Marbury mm-hmm I was feeling very
bohemian chic today so this is their
Brazilian curly from unit hair and I bet
quite a few reviews per unit area for
from a lot of other gurus and stuff like
that
I've had a pair since June and I checked
it out quite a few quite a lot of curly
hair as of recently so we're going to
start with this they sent me don't
remember what my bundles are I'm
thinking is I think this is 422 and my
frontal I believe was 18-inch frontal
these are speculations
I don't remember because it's been that
long and this is usually what happens
when I have here for a very long period
of time I don't necessarily jot down
stuff because after a while that's what
makes a week I wear it I get to know all
those great things about it things I do
don't like I usually forget what is what
I always number my wigs
I usually after I take them off because
a lot of times everything else form I'll
you take them off and our pin either if
it's it is I usually like these big
ziploc bag but I'll put them in there
with like a little paper or even though
it's not the receipt so like the info
card is they give me I'll put it in here
so when I fold this one
every time I pull it out I'm like okay
this one looked a lot like I did one
Lord would be I don't remember what it
was I just provide that coca-cola turtle
that's what this here reminds me of the
only difference between this hair and
that here is the fact that this hair
sheds a little bit more than that hair
does that's the only difference between
it
I think the curl pattern is pretty
similar although I like this a little
bit on the drier side versus that one I
liked a little bit when it was more on
the wet this Meyer is completely dry
right now so this is what the texture
looks like and I'm wearing I believe
this is a three bundles of 22 inch and
and I think I have an 18 inch length of
18 inch Runkle
again you guys it's been a while since
I've actually relieved this hair so it's
been a mission so when I first got is of
course I bleach the knots on my phone so
that I can have this little baby here
actually you know I wanna have curly
here I like to have usually a side part
just because I feel like it looks better
because usually when it is the middle
part it's a little wet mangy doll it's
not you or if it's like really big like
this air hold on or if it's really big
like this then I like to usually little
more notice we need you to film they
don't know when it will be big like this
I like to either wear like this or I
like to wear like this it just come out
of this breast please thank you for
loving thank you
so it's one of those things where I'm
when I when I test it out it's just be
curly hair what I like to do is I like
to wet it down with completely just
water nothing in it right now I have
conditioner in it and Crow cream from
Garnier Fructis as a curl calm down it
was to do is curl calm down from so I
just mix those with some water and then
this has got my hair to kind of stay and
more of a natural and not so mangy look
a run through it like this this is
usually when the hair starts to get
really big as you can see it's going to
get bigger here which is that know what
I want I got somewhere to go I like to
keep it more of a natural tame look all
the hair is pulled forward so it doesn't
is not crazy full it's full but inside
overtaking my face and then
as how frontal is a little bit shorter
in the front and then the rest of my
hair I just braided it all down it's
kind of a milkmaid braid here in the
front so what it does is because my
frontal is not the same length as my
hose it just kind of disc Emma flies it
and I'm not crazy about layers and curly
hair just because sometimes it starts to
look a little bit like steps and that's
not what I'm going for
so I like to definitely keep it more so
on the same side at least for this look
you know I live for the Donna summers
Diana Ross moment but this is not what
this is this is definitely cool all of
this right here is my frontal so this is
the frontal this is mine so my frontal
kind of goes like this and then my real
hair is right here just because I wanted
to make it look as real as possible and
sometimes when I'm noticing people were
curly here and it for huncles in they
end up with that way - look where you
can tell it's us and you can tell at
least it but it's still display the
hairline is so cool and is right here I
don't like that so we pulled it back
none of this is mine none of this is
mine and this is mine
all that's the frontal so I like this
I'm not crazy about it just because like
I said the shutting was a little bit mmm
and I only would get it I had some hair
not too long ago where this was
happening it was shed when I was waiting
for when it was dry you wouldn't so I
don't now I'm not getting it but again I
had to throw some jewels but you do the
math I wear especially Oh as of recently
I like to work curly hair more so in the
winter time when it's cooler out and I
do like the summers in the summer
oh yeah were like from when wave you
know like right here and the summer and
it's hot and girl talk about a mangy dog
okay shout out to pop it boss oh we've
all been there
but I like to work during this time were
is like cool enough but it's not too hot
just because my head would say moussed
and it will have some hydration verses
in the summer soon as I leave the house
and the Sun hit it is round so that's my
only thing is that the shedding was just
a little bit more than I would have
liked but again this was a unit that I
sold together I did not have
unit you do use the hot glue gun method
or putting your wits together then it
will automatically to you where we thin
will stop it from shedding if you do
decide to cut them you guys know I like
to cut my Webster's because I like our
very slight install and sometimes you
cannot always get it depending on what
the construction of the actual web our
base one defender so I'll get units hair
also I want to give them a nice b-plus
just because everything else about the
hair are really like the color is a very
natural color it's not too dark
sometimes you I don't know three all but
for me if it's too dark I start to look
very Spanish and for some people that's
to look that they want but I don't want
to look like a different race I just
want to look like I got some nice pretty
Spanish type hair but you know usually
people who are Spanish the hair you'll
be extremely dark and sometimes it also
looks a little bit of faith who is first
in a baby here area where when you have
the hair is too darling I've gotten here
like never I just send it back because
it was a little too dark and I didn't
like the way that I was looking like I'm
looking little assault below our wig so
I do like the color a lot I do like the
texture a lot I just you know again you
see I was like not too dark is still
black but it's off black so it makes my
face look softer and makes my look look
softer versus this was super dude but
similarly on here like so like sister
when she was on sister sister a it was
dark
oh the AMC I'm Cristin Milioti very dark
and that's looking cute if that's the
look you're going for but for a rate of
people in a ray of shade a one be
usually goes great and a lot of people
don't know the difference put put one
put a one B and a one next to each other
and you see the difference so yeah like
I said a B+ for unit hair but I did like
their customer service as you love their
patience and I do like this hair again I
don't love it just because of the
shading issue I got an even 100 with
y'all cause that's where beautiful oh
but I think if they can get the shedding
issue together I'm going to get tangling
which is you would think then we go with
your shedding the thing will go hand in
hand but I don't get too many are too
like issues and appear in the backward
one of the babies because of me I can't
do good then they get crazy with me so I
definitely keep that hydrated and I'll
run my fingers through it conversing
some people just go like this and then
you end up with just a management here
in the back which is not attractive or
cute so if you guys are interested in
this hair make sure you guys hit the
links below
again this is unit hair they're
Brazilian curly and I am wearing I
believe three bundles of 22 22 or 24
inch am ugly pointed forage three
bundles of 20 22 24 inch and in my
frontal for sure I believe the 18 lace
frontals as well so let me know what you
guys like I wanted to just advise no I
wants to do this look just make it up it
seemed like a lot of natural hairstyles
and I know a lot of you girls are
natural girls and you guys don't go for
as always say the nice glowing it but I
wanted to do something that everybody
could do and it look very natural and
yeah so let me know if you like the
milkmaid braid situation and I can't
y'all their money</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
