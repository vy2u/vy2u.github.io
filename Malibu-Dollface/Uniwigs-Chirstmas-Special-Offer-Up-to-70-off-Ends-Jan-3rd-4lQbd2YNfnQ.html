an update on this wig that I'm wearing
which is from of course new wigs um this
is that Rihanna wig that I reviewed
probably a couple of weeks are about a
month system change ago and I just
wanted to let you guys know because I
want to let you guys know about some
adult deals that they got going on for
the holiday season as well but as far as
the wig is concerned I shampooed it I'm
conditioned it related so it's real
 and it's been holding up great
this week is still very snug and I've
wore this wig quite some time I've you
know you know after a while if one wigs
they do start to get a little bit loose
but no this one is still good like I
really have to do nothing it's not taped
or glued down or nothing is just there
you know
um but yeah hasn't had any shedding and
I haven't had any issues with it which I
thought I might have because of the
color I thought I was going to like
after I wash name's gonna sound like
orange or something but no it only bled
a little bit but it wasn't like crazy so
onto the deals that they have going on
right now on their site for the holiday
season
they have a special offers deal for
about forty items on their site and
these items include clip-ins
lace closures lace frontals colorful
clip ins as well as wigs you know human
hair wigs themselves they have like this
Remi
just one remi wig that is of this the
sierra ombre where it's dark here and
then it gets like very very ash blonde
at the bottom and then they have another
one that's like jet-black like you guys
know my signature that I love all so
much where it's you know just bone
straight if that's the look that you're
going for and those are on sale for that
particular deal as well if you're not
gonna back from that particular bin but
you're a new customer and you still want
to try like maybe a full wig or whatever
and they have one that you like but they
have a different one in a different
section you can also save 10% off your
entire order by using cold or eg ten if
you are returning customer and you make
a purchase you need are you
if you are returning customer and you
make a purchase uni weeks and said they
will send you guys a surprise gift a big
surprise gift with your package I don't
know what the gift is I have no clue
what it is however I will go ahead and
try it if I seen something that was you
know something to my liking and if you
make any purchase at all remember uni
weeks is one of those companies that
will give you things in return for
videos photos and our reviews that you
write on their site just to show their
appreciation which i think is great
because when you are buying something
and you have positive feedback from a
company and you want to you know
consistently buy from them then it's
great to always have a little bit of
help because every little bit counts
especially during these holiday times so
if you have a little extra money left
over from Christmas or you got some
Christmas money and you want to kind of
invest in your first wig I think they
would actually be the go-to company I
would send you two just to start off
with and kind of understand and still
give you great quality and they also
remember if you use code Dec 14 save up
to three hundred dollars off I think
regularly priced items so let's just say
that the wig is four hundred dollars I
think that you can save up to three
hundred dollars depending on the price I
don't think if the wig is 365 they gonna
give you three dollars off if you pay
$65 I don't think that's what they're
saying I think they're saying that
that's as far as the savings will go
depending on what items you particularly
buy um but yeah I don't know it wasn't
really specified to me what that exactly
meant but for going from what I know for
themselves in general I think that's
what they mean and remember this goes on
in January third so you have a little
bit after the new year to figure out
exactly what you want and if any of
these things apply to what you're trying
to get for the new year
from a person who has hacked this week
for quite some time and I've Ward and I
kind of put it through the paces it's
definitely worth it um I love this and
the one thing that I will say about them
as far as wig or wig company is
concerned they're one of the very few
companies that actually have great
density already in their hair so that's
the great thing about it I love the fact
that my hair is still full you know it
still
you can't see through it you know if
none of that is still really really nice
and also always remember where most
companies as well most of them offer you
a custom unit option meaning if you love
this week that I'm currently wearing but
the only thing that you don't like about
it is maybe the length maybe it's too
long maybe it's too short you can always
go to them and say look I want this same
hair he had or she had or they had but I
would like it in a different length
because it will you know complement and
you know what I'm trying to do a little
bit more than the generic so that's
always an option yes sometimes it does
cost a little bit more but it's not like
I said in another video I will say for
something that you will probably wear
every day it's always an investment
because you're definitely going to make
your money back no matter what you do so
that'll be great so I hope you guys
enjoyed this I hope you guys have a
great holiday weekend merry Christmas to
everyone and I'll be back probably
before Christmas but I'll be back
because I have something else that I'm
doing it I'm kind of revisiting so look
out for that and I was talk to you guys
to the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
