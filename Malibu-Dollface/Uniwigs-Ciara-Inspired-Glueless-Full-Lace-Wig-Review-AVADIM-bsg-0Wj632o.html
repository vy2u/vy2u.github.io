week that I am rocking right now which
quite frankly I didn't think I was gonna
like it but I actually like it a lot
it's from uni wigs um so you guys know
that I expressed this in another video
that you know I had an issue we're
trying to find a blonde that worked with
my skin tone and then sometimes is not
the blonde it's the ombre but this is
kind of a good mesh up of both which I
really like um and the beginning this
video I'm drink I've seen how it looks
without the Hat but I just thought that
just added a little more pizzazz to the
hair you guys know that I work with your
new weeks before this is there Ciara
inspired wig if I'm not mistaken um but
I'll give you guys the specs but I do
want to tell you something that I
noticed about this a wig this time
around that they sent me versus the
other ones that they sent when I got the
packaging it came with this thing right
here which says WIC hygiene gone says
here um I don't know if they would know
for a fact if you wore this I mean it
just looks like a coloring cap um but it
is keep the hygiene down because you
don't somebody returns a wig you don't
know what's in their head you know so if
you don't know you're gonna mess around
and get wing worm because somebody tried
on a wig because they got a dirty scalp
so I think this is actually a good idea
I don't know if somebody will actually
use it
but it's a good idea this time around it
didn't come with a brush or any of that
it just came with but we hit um this was
up under the wig and I was it I want to
come with this little part here that
lets me know it says uni wigs on this
side and then it has the information
which says it's a celebrity style which
is CL 0 4 0 1 so yeah I'm almost
starting this is the Sierra way the
Sierra wave remy hair ombre blonde
color last week that's a long title um
so yeah this the picture of this was a
picture of Sierra and she had like this
hairstyle but it has some waves to it
now you guys I just talked about this in
a previous video where I said the reason
why I don't curl a lot of my wigs is
because the density is isn't thick
enough to curl and it's going to look
kind of thin or if I put you know curls
you need a lot of body for them to sit
right and when you don't have a lot of
body in the wig it just makes the curls
look like hot dog curls and like I'm not
to go to elementary school graduation so
it's not a cute look so um I opted not
to do that or put waves in the hair I
wanted to just go ahead and keep it
straight and all another reason why I
want to keep straight as well is because
I want you guys to see that because it
was color blonde okay so this is how the
ombre is and it's done beautifully it's
not a bad job at all but at the ends of
this hair it just seems very very it's
not dry at all but it comes off as dry
you know you overprocess hair and then
it doesn't really want to stay down or
lay down like you want to so it has this
um it's like this frayed look like all
of these little pieces right here like
this one they don't want to stay down
like they're supposed to so then they
give me this big net of a mess you know
it's like okay this hair is everywhere
it feels like now this part does because
of course it's black but the bottom is
no it's not really much luster but the
hair is very soft but it's something
about this hair especially with blonde
hair it gets very wiry like this and it
doesn't want to stay down like it's
supposed to so that's one of the things
that I really don't like about this here
because I wore this hair to my little
friends arm gel like this little
bohemian chic get-together lunch thing
and I wore it and every all your hair is
beautiful and I was like thank you but
behind the scenes I'm just feeling you
know trying to make sure that the hair
is out of my face I hate that that's the
one reason why I don't really like
blonde hair like that cuz it tends most
of the time you get blonde wigs or
blonde weave if it's not colored
properly it does this mic
sighs is a petit which is a 21 inch cap
I guess 21 all the way around the color
is a celebrity color so it is an
additional 28 days so that's a month you
have to wait which i think is quite
extra it's 22 inches and let's see that
was about right yeah because 24 usually
hits my waist which I think it's I mean
it's the perfect length for this this is
great any longer I don't really think I
would have liked it as much but this is
actually great I like I use like my
blonde hair not as long as my dark hair
so I usually like my dark hair is 30
inches I would probably go no more than
a 26 inch for blonde and that's pushing
it so it says that the density of this
wig is 150 and that's an additional $55
and that's an additional 7 days to get
um it custom to this density which it
looks full but it's not whole like from
a distance like this it looks like my
hair is really really full you might
think I have here in the back and I
don't everything is pulled to the front
so it's not as full as I would like it
and I don't you guys know how I feel
about density when it comes down to wigs
they're not really my favorite um
because a lot of companies they say it's
one thing but I just I know what a thick
wig feels like I just reviewed a thick
wig so I know exactly what it feels like
and this to me is not 150 density they
mean their charts may be a little
different than mine's but I this is not
150 density I just okay I've had this
week for quite some time
um it's taking me a while to review this
because I was trying to figure out I was
going to cut it originally I was that
was my goal to cut it but the
circumstances have permitted me from
doing that so yeah I think the ombre
that they did on this hair is very great
um I think in a video before you guys
should have seen it what it looks like
without the Hat um so yeah it has a
great it's a great wig for somebody who
wants something a plot point and have a
different style for a second but I don't
know if this would be the greatest wig
for somebody who wants a lot of density
in their blonde hair because blonde hair
tends to not look at fullest black hair
for obvious reasons
but I do like it I'm gonna keep it um
because when I have my moments where I
do want to go blonde real quick and run
out and we're all gold ain't nothing
greater than matching go with your
blonde or white hair so you know why not
so again this wig is from uni wigs um
I'm not gonna color it on my wedges for
my living hip-hop review this week
possibly um and I'm not going to curl it
but we'll see you guys will definitely
be seeing this wig again I'm trying to
get into more of the blonde side because
I'll do it every color blonde so you
know Barbie's blonde I love Barbie so
why not so yeah um I will catch you guys
in my next one let me know what you guys
thought about this wig down below and
let me know what you guys want to see
next only thing that I'm going to say is
no orange and no purple because I cannot
stand purple
and I'm not a big fan of orange hair all
right bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
