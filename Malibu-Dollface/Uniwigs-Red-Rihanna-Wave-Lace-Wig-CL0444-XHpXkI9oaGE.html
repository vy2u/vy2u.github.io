dangerous
okay guys so I am want to review this
beautiful red wig that I'm wearing right
now
um this wig is from uni wigs and this is
my second review for uni wigs you guys
know the first one I did um is when I
had some black side part um with like
the great Olivia Pope jacket that
everybody likes I got some permission or
um I did that one and I loved that wig
I'm still to this day oh my mom's
praying ones to buy that wig so bad for
me um but yeah this is their red wig
this is their Rihanna inspired wig and
it's really wet this okay you guys know
I've had been here before however that
was a closure and it was what the hair I
love this color the other color that I
have was more of a brighter red it was
like a neon II shred this is more like a
tame k.michelle red um so yeah I love
this when I got the wig it had like this
curl like this like body wave ish pearl
already in it so I brushed those out and
then I just took my regular um curlers
Miconia curlers that I use for
everything and curled this and cut just
a little bit of a bang in the front so
that it could frame my face a little bit
better um it has two combs is Atsuko
it's one comb in the back then it has
the smaller combs that go around and
it's adjustable strap and then there's
two combs right here right here
which is a different because most wig
only come with three combs one in a
million
one in a million really are one in the
middle and two on the side and an
adjustable strap in the back so this
actually has a lot of security like this
it's not gonna go nowhere which I like I
don't have anything bonded down I just
have it behind my hairline and it's a
little further back then usually then I
will usually do but my braids are really
old so um yeah but it's the hair is
really soft and the when I you usually
like color hair from companies it smells
like the color like whatever color
that'd be like if they use the door on
the color then it would smell like that
because they probably lifted the hair
deposited red and then went over it with
a semi-permanent um I just don't smell
like nothing it smells perfect it smells
like a new wigs it don't smell like you
know color or anything which I love and
let me get you guys the specs on this
puppet - um this is it took to get to me
it took between no I think it's like
four days like it wasn't that long
probably not even that long um this is
the Rihanna wave brimmy hair
ombre lace wig and it's the number CL 0
4 4 4 on the construction the cap
construction is a full cap a full lace
cap the cap size is a petite 21 and the
color is a celebrity color so when you
guys get celebrity colors from them it
takes an additional 28 days is what it
says and the length is 20 22 inches
which I think this is longer than 22
I've had 22 inches and this is curled so
yeah this is I mean 24 comes down here
but
I don't I don't think this is twins I
think it's a little bit longer than what
they're saying it is but that's fine by
me because I read they feel longer then
be shorter than what they say I already
get more hair you know but more bang for
the buck um if you are a person who is
you have a lot of red undertones like me
then it's work for you if you are not a
person who has red undertones like me
this may be a little off when you get it
as far as the color like to compliment
your skin tone
because it is very red and it's not
really showing how red it is on camera
that it actually is it's like a Jessica
Rabbit red that's Google Jessica Rabbit
and then you'll see what I'm talking
about it's more of that red where it's
more it's more dark than light if that
makes anything it has it's not so marker
and it's more of a deep deep it's like
the color of my jacket okay but it's
just hair um it was easy to curl it held
a curl it was no problem
i money get no snacks no shedding none
of that um it was cold
even after I cut it nice nearly cut my
cap a little bit um and that little
piece of hair came out but other than
that it's real good um so yeah uni wigs
I like it in again you guys know I have
a thing about fullness and wig if it's
too thin I get upset because I'm like
who wants a fan switch but this their
ways
have a nice density to them they're
realistic but they're not too thick but
they're not too thin where you put three
curls in it and it looks just really
stupid or you have to wear the hair
straight some hair looks really great
straight when it's tan but when you put
a curl in it it's gonna be four big
curls and that's it so this actually is
really really pretty um I love it is
that make sense um yeah so I will I'm
gonna start doing more of a middle parts
that I've been wearing the heck out of
these side parts but they're just so
easy for me because they frame my face
and you keep everything out of my face
just this part is fine but when it's
just like this a lot but yeah shout out
to uni wigs because um
they did the heck on this and it took a
while for me to get it because it was
like this is like one of our new
arrivals and I wanted okay but I don't
like to say okay I'll do the review on
the new wig and they'll send me a
picture Rihanna and I'm like that's not
what its gonna look like so actually it
actually did looks very similar to what
she had which is kind of a little
mind-boggling because usually I get it
in and run with nothing like that but
the curl pattern was what it should be
and it took the curls that I put in
which was me
very very very easily so I think I'll do
another curling tutorial possibly so
some because some people see asking me
how about somewhere like this as well
just kind of show you like a little
technique that I do so if you find out
um but yet again this wig is from we are
this wig again is from green wig it
comes with a brush it came with the are
when you violate some them it comes with
this color swatch and it's a this color
swatch will tell you what the color when
your ring will tell you um what colors
they are so you can hold them up to your
face and see what a work for you and
what won't and it came through this a
wig cap which is actually a wig liner
which I hate these I'll just rather the
regular solid and solid brown caps I
like those better because you can see in
the part you can see the netting which
you gotta put these you are over it
without the green red which I would
rather than just a solid cap um so yeah
I hope you guys enjoyed this and um I
will talk to you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
