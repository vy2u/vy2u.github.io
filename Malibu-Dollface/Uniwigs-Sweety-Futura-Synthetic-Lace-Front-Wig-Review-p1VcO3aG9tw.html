guys so I know this look is very
different from what I'm used to
um but because of this hair I just felt
the need to dig in my closet and find
some things gonna ask this jacket with
the wings on the back are my chair is my
Jeremy Scott jacket this week is from
uni wigs you guys know that I work with
your new wigs in the past I've never had
an issue with any of their wigs I love
them but this one is a little different
because it is synthetic and it has it's
very vampy feel to it which I love about
it
and when I took it out the bag bought
the box I was like I'm gonna definitely
love this wig um and I was like well I
want to try a synthetic wig because
everybody can afford human hair wigs so
just to have something that's a little
you know different would definitely be
great for those who are trying to save a
buck but they want that realistic look
now this is wig is may look for - or
fibers so that means that you can eat
this wig up to 350 degrees um I just did
it in my flat iron is on 360 and it
almost melted so they're not lying do
not go over 350 or you might mess around
with a very very melted wig so to the
actual leg itself the cap instruction of
this wig is pretty decent um it's it's a
little different from my other wigs
because the only amount of parting space
is what that I have is this so this is
one part stop just wear the lace tops
and then the rest of this is just a wig
um it's not like um full lace where the
lace of the hair is plucked into the
actual cap they're actually wefted
across in the back which doesn't bother
me because it does get like really flat
um because uh actual the actual webs of
the wig are really thin but this
weight is very very thick I don't know
what density this is but it is very very
thick this is all the hair I'm gonna see
if I can show you guys how thick this
hair is so this is all the hair that's a
lot of hair for one side okay so let me
give you the specs on this wig um I
don't have them in front of me
perspective this wig should actually
been a beginning of this video because I
don't know verbatim exactly what cap
size I have but I will give you the
style number of this wig this is called
the sweetie for two or synthetic lace
front wig so it's a lace front it's not
a full lace wig so that's why I only get
so much parting which probably was only
like three inches probably four if I'm
lucky but that's definitely about two to
three um the color of this the color is
SL zero one zero zero five - why - 201
so this is from their synthetic line
most wig companies sell synthetic wigs
but they they're very stock looking
meaning they don't have a particular
color to them like this and what
attracted me got you know I love my gray
hair so it I was like I want to try a
synthetic wig and gray I will say this
about this wig this wig is great as a
photoshoot wig like if you needed a lot
of wind and you needed a long wig this
would be very perfect for that but I
don't know about everyday wear of this
hair gets very very very tangled and it
sheds a lot this is all the hair that is
shedded out of this wig so far since
I've had it um I attempted to wear this
hair out um and before I could get out
the door I had to take it off because it
was it was like you see right here where
he just wants to keep getting caught and
I'm so used to working with virgin hair
that is very sleek when I make it
straight like this it stays straight I
can only put so much heat on it so I
can't really lay down my part like I
mean it's pretty flat but like I want
because I can't put a pressing home on
it to get it to lay down I did Flatiron
it with my Remington Flatiron that I use
for everything and it didn't give me any
problems it just I have to of course I
can put it up to four hundred and fifty
five degrees like I really want to and
really lay it down and have it be sleek
and long like I want to because it is
synthetic because there is so much of it
it does like to again get tangled and
that's really frustrating like if I if I
took all this hair and threw it to one
side I would have to then take a brush
and brush it out because it wouldn't go
back into place like real hair does um
but if you're looking for something and
maybe you're going to a costume party or
you're doing a photo shoot or something
like that where somebody can pretty much
stay on hand and watch the hair yeah
this would be great for that and it's
really full that's the good thing about
it like most synthetic wigs are thinner
than most one hundred percent density
wigs so this week is actually pretty
full compared to I think even my red one
that they sent me my human hair revlon
mariana one should which should be right
here um that wig is really full too but
i think if this one maybe like 150
density probably I'm not for sure on
that so don't quote me but I will say
this is a lot of hair on one wig if
they're human hair weaves are like this
I'm too poor let me tell you but it does
when you brush it it does brush very
nice it doesn't get any tangles any
snags or stuff like that unless it gets
to the point where it's been sitting or
it starts to buckle in the back of your
neck or something like that then you're
going to start to fill it um so that
would be my only downfall I don't I
don't think I've ever had a
synthetically in my life I don't think
I've ever worked with synthetic hair
because it's very difficult at times
it's sometimes more difficult than human
hair because it's not real hair so when
I received it it came with an actual
clipping this is a oh yeah I came with a
clip in hold on
it came with a lavender
position right now roll bar although
I'll have a couple in the following row
sorrowful falling off
oh I long for fault
what about my home pull it all
I sleep in does not want to clip in so
I'm one just got to leave this alone no
this is the most simple life clip-ins
just a simple life look it's Ted Nicole
Richie um well yeah so that would be the
color so it actually looks nice not with
this color but if I can find it so see
it actually looks nice you can see like
I have like a little extra color in it
now um but because they're so big you
can hardly tell oh there you go see
that's Q so I came with that and then it
also came with extra clips if I wanted
to put like more clips in because I
didn't post a cure enough and then it
came with this violet I'm always always
just keep Jesus
it also came with you know paper that
goes inside the wig the lunch lady
Annette and then it came it came with a
weaving cap aka called a mesh cap but
just a shout-out to you anyways just
these don't really work we need a wig
caps because these don't do nothing
especially when you wearing lace and you
can just see the hair through but yeah
it's just yeah so that's what there are
those are all the things that came with
my wig when I got it again it's not a
bad wig as far as um a wig is concern
but it's just because it's synthetic had
this been human this would have been a
whole different story baby but yeah um
I'm gonna try to do something with this
maybe like put some flexi rods in it or
something and kind of see how it behaves
and I think this will be great with the
side part and then like a lot of Valium
here like my Jessica Rabbit and then
just a lot of layers
I think this would actually work very
well with this but as far as just this
itself again this is not everyday hair
because you will be very upset unless
you were like in a ponytail or something
or a bun or something like that but just
wearing it straight like this and then
trying to get your life that's not gonna
really work much you know so I'll catch
y'all in my next one I'll let you guys
know if I decide to do something with
this week because I think it's dope I
think the concept is dope and I try to
carry on that concept with vine outfit
but yeah I don't really know much but
again it's long um I think this leg is
28 inches if I'm not mistaken I think
the wig is 28 is pretty long especially
on me and I'm I'm 5 foot 4 so this is
where my jacket and my waist stop and
this is where it comes so yeah oh this
is cute though there's a little more hot
on friendship</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
