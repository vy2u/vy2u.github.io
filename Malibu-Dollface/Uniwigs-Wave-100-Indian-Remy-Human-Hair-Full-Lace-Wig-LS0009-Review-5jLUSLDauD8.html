leaf and autumn breathe Oh winter snow
and neighbor rain your everything inside
my dreams and I get to wait okay so this
is going to be a review for this week
that I am currently wearing which is
from uni wigs and this wig I received I
think I want to say I received this wig
probably about a week and some change
ago but I don't recall um I've had them
for like a little bit it's not been that
long but it's not been a long time ago
either so I don't know when you receive
the way it's going to come in a box like
this this particular unit that I'm
currently wearing is style number LS
zero zero zero nine it was a one in it's
jet black um I haven't had a black hair
in a long time they have care
instructions as well so that you can you
know know what you should is your first
time buying a lace wig or whatever okay
it comes with a brush is a vintage
paddle brush which is nice and then it
also came with an instruction for uni
wigs products so it has a booklet of all
the stuff that you should know if you
don't know what you're doing I don't
need a hint
today the cap size is a petite 21 so
usually when you go get wigs from sites
it'll say cap size 1 or cap size 0 or
small medium or large so there's a
little bit different it's a jet black
Indian remy full lace wig um in the
length is 24 inches I curled his hair so
this is all there pretty much pull to
one side because I always just have it
either front or back so
try something different this union did
not come with clips in it so currently I
have no clips in know nothing if I slide
this puppy back it's going to slide back
it also came with this coloring I guess
I'll take it out but it came with a
coloring which I thought was really cool
because a lot of comes a lot of times
when you work with companies or you buy
repetitively from companies you're not
really sure what the color is going to
look like until you get it which sucks
because if you get a color that doesn't
go with your undertone or your skin tone
for that matter you're pretty much a
left what happened to send the wig back
which takes more time for you to get
what you want so therefore for my
understanding the email that I had with
Susan over there at uni wigs she said
that when you do order you should
receive uh-oh one of these colorings if
you request one I believe and they have
all the the color names on them so you
know which one is what and then it comes
with all of these so you know which
color hair you're getting so you can
pretty much swatch it to see what's
gonna what's gonna go with your skin
tone and what's not um so I thought that
was really cool the box is actually
really nice it's not no regular box it
took time to actually print a box um
about the unit that I'm currently
wearing my likes and dislikes one thing
that I do like is it lays really really
flat and it didn't take much for me to
get it this flat I cut a little bit of
layer in the front like right here just
so that it won't sit you know clean down
or whatever on my face um it's full it's
not over full but it's not 100% density
thin it's like just the right amount and
of course since I've added these um
curls in here it actually did help the
when I received the wig it was more like
a wavy texture it had like this nice
little weight to it or whatever which is
nice but it wasn't I couldn't do
anything with it like it just looked
like some it looked course you know it
didn't have this beautiful ike the
picture on the side that's pretty much
what it was but you had to work with it
so um I usually when I receive units I
don't go wash them or watch them because
I want to see what they're going to do
fresh off the box but this one I had to
because I begin to
early and one problem that I ran into
was the fact that it was greasy not
necessarily like I put some blue magic
grease in it but it just had this
stringy feel when I curled it so I was
like well I'm just washed whatever is in
and I'll just simply just wash it out
and then start over so I washed it last
night and then um it air dry or whatever
and then I just do some curls in it and
then kind of layered it a little bit in
the front it still has that greasy feel
to it which I don't understand why after
i Aiko washed it and I use my clarifying
shampoo but the hair is really fine so I
guess any type of oils that was left in
it's just like you have to get them all
out in order for them to act right I
don't know I've never had this issue
before but I don't dislike the union at
all actually really love it the issue
and the problem that I have is that it's
a little bit greasy like I wouldn't wear
this wig straight like that's just a
no-no like for this particular wig to
wear this straight would look like I had
a greasy price kind of sort of you know
but what I did was to kind of get that
out and help it I use some some dry
shampoo and whenever you have wigs that
are either too shiny or they're a little
bit greasy or your hair gets raised if
you use dry shampoo and then comb it out
it'll help diffuse the oils that are in
the hair so that's pretty much what I
did and then I just talks with the curls
or whatever and then brought it over all
to one side because I never wear my hair
like this just for something a little
bit different um because you guys know I
live in a side part you know so I don't
want it to get a little bit boring
some of you say it is born but I like it
okay works for my face so there you go
um so yeah I don't have anything else
really to say about the unit it's nice
it's pretty um the hair texture is
really really soft when I received this
wig this is the softest wig I've ever
gotten ever sent to me and I mean that
like no BS this was very so it is still
very soft and I put hairspray in it and
everything and it's still very very soft
so you know you really can't go wrong
with that but it's nice it's pretty it's
pretty you know to the point um I don't
really know what the issue is where
soozee oil no like I don't know why is
it so breezy time and I don't want to
like use like dishwashing liquid to do
it because then I'm gonna drive the wig
out and the night's gonna suck because
I'm either deep conditioning which
probably will make the situation worse
and I don't want to do that because it
is a very soft and beautiful unit I
don't want to mess it up so yeah um let
me know what you guys think again off
with all the information to this week
below this should be right here should
be the style number two this week and
are going to have 24 inches it is Indian
Ramin and it's in one beam so yeah
and it's full lace as well um it didn't
have any this trade on't have a
stretchable panel in the back like some
of the other ones I mean it's
stretchable but it's not like that one
little string like adjustable strap
situation it's not in the back it's like
I could bond this week down in the back
and then throw it in a ponytail it's
like that type of wave so yeah again if
you guys have any questions just put
them below and make sure you guys visit
our uni wigs if you're interested in
this particular unit um I love the
thickness is that they will won me over
so out of a ten I'll give this a 7
because the thickness and the actual
flatness because it's cool but it's not
pull at the roots it didn't take me much
to flatten it and then also the fact
that it's very free-flowing and soft so
yeah y'all get a seven for this
it just needs I don't know if it's just
my unit of look like I said I don't know
but yeah you make sure you guys hit up
uni wigs and I will talk to you guys in
the next one bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
