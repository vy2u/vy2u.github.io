have to say this like I'm tired of going
out to these places that these are urban
are places of color for our gay people
and they're just like fucking they make
you want to kill yourself because it's
like no to the club last night right and
she left her cigarettes in a car and in
the club he went to thank you if what
you pay to get in you can't leave her
you gotta pay again go back out niggas
so we she got so mad because the club he
was who was his girl as club and they
had I just smoked place at the bottom so
beer out there smoking and she was so
much she's like I love our fucking
cigarettes and alcohol whole mood change
it was like oh she's just sniff all the
fuckin smoke that's around she's oh my
god fucking irritated I'm fuckin
irritated right fuck she was pleased
though she likes you just wanna fuckin
hate black ass well oh listen honey with
the white people he said let you leave
it come out as long as you buy drinks so
you have something else is they know
about the club
that's it is terrible like I'm sorry my
phone's ringing ah that's terrible I
understand like why we can't upgrade
ourselves as black people in the
community like it's terrible
like I shouldn't have I should be able
to go no I'm not saying they don't fire
me
so you think you about go you're ready
it's just okay like I feel like it's
just it's appalling like we should have
we should have more respect for
ourselves and just as black people as
people of color because it's not just
black people this is people it's cult
they're like when you go to places like
West Hollywood then this is for people
that live in LA well you got a places
like West Hollywood or even downtown or
even some places in Long Beach the shit
is more upscale it's like goddamn it
it's it's more upscale as cute it's nice
it's not like that here like look we're
yeah but still like niggas shit when I
look outside look at the people in the
club I know but you gotta start
somewhere at some point you gotta back
they don't care so why should you but
they need to care yeah yeah we can't not
care about shit no more like it citizens
we all die soon we should care about
something before y'all know you care
about your clothes know that we
shouldn't be so selfish those when I'm
saying okay but in a way this is the
thing that we have to realize too if you
change the type of club it's not gonna
change the type of people that's the
difference and no one's gonna put their
hard-earned money into a club where you
gonna have Tanisha Tanaka
Darion Lucian um AC you have all these
people come and then they're gonna just
fuckin fuck it up
but even like on the catch on Fridays
they have goth night like completely
different Mela different type of part a
different type of person all together
but they still pack it because they have
a different type of place and the place
is called so these people can go so if
you change the atmosphere you have a
better DJ you have air conditioning so
it doesn't smell funky you have cats
love smell like straight hot dog water I
mean just look right and you have
couches that don't have cum stains I
mean the orbiter couch are I mad to the
club
we had a couch period it's just that
that's what I'm saying like little
things like that like you have a
computer or a computer e-library but you
don't have a screen or the fucking
karaoke showing you just show it on the
wall like I mean that's the problem for
the wall every time we gotta sing the
same damn song this is the thing that is
why there is a difference between
Crenshaw Pico and Santa Monica and
Roberson that is why there is a
difference between that no but there as
to why there is a difference because of
the simple fact that some people that
are in african-american gay community
like that that's what they like that's
the type of clubs they want they don't
feel comfortable unless Holly we're
going to the abbey are going to rage are
going to cantina because some of them
are not comfortable we ask people
especially in the black community we are
brought up to not respect or the racist
we are we're taught that black is the
entity of all entities that everything
is just everything is great and that's
not true so then you have people who are
african-american grow up and believe it
that to be true and they are not
comfortable in different settings with
different people of different race
that's the whole point because they're
not comfortable you have to make them
comfortable so but the thing is you have
to understand is that people there
they're like that Dave was raised like
that that's the type of person that they
are and as you get older you've set in
your ways like older people you know how
you
your granny B she said to her when she's
not gonna change for nobody so if you're
brought up and you've been like that for
so long you're not gonna change because
the things that people have said to you
about these particular people may not be
true but they believe that shit to be
true and they're not gonna be
open-minded enough to not listen to what
they've been told and change their their
you know how they live that's why when
people don't understand that it's the
difference between doing and saying
and then you start to do stuff and what
I was saying it and you see the
difference in your life so that's how
people are when it comes down to certain
social settings I know people who can't
deal with not being around black people
they just can't do it they can't leave
the token black person within the group
they don't like it and with me I don't
give a fuck I don't care if you but
Chinese and we can have a little time we
can have a good time that's what I like
fun
that is the difference I don't care what
color you are even if you've raised that
way so you have to have some type of
enlightenment and if nobody fucking is
going to show you that it's something
better than being black are not even
better than being back that sounds
fucked up but it's something more to
then just your skin color it's more out
there than fucking you know fucking
hip-hop music listen out all right like
it's more than that then you're not
gonna get it you're just gonna be stuck
in our way and you're not gonna go
outside to find us and you need it to
come to you so that's what I'm saying
like if we upgrade if we do all these
little small things because there's a
lot of people that are a force in check
and they urban and they're there if
they're good for the community and they
they accept more update they accept
other cultures but for people at the
couch they don't know a reason why they
doing it there's a lot of these people
that attend this club or from the area
in which the club is located so that's
the difference like it's not gonna
change is not isn't half Adam Haines big
pass washer so I mean it is what it is
you know saying you can't really say
well maybe it became Sidon because you
know under steam the higher cut around
real quick
but basically if you change the setting
of a club that's in the more ghetto area
no one know promoters know businesses
none of that are gonna promote they're
gonna put their place to come in that's
not gonna make a world of a difference
so yeah
it's just understand that and I'm saying
so if you are gay in LA and you only
been to catch one and that's it try to
and lie to yourself it goes wrong okay
some all right Tiffany call it the trap
you know try to broaden your horizons
pretty much you have to go where the
need is the need is not gonna come to
you that's just the bottom line
nobody's gonna set up a nicer lush plush
club off Crenshaw and Pico for nobody
that's nobody's gonna know nobody's
gonna because the catches look like
somebody's house so that's what I'm
saying so that should tear it down we
model it first
who's gonna fund that I'm just saying
the owners should do that who got the
money for that somebody has to have the
money that make money they make $10 a
head they charge for everything they
charge $5 for parking they got money
yeah yeah but the thing is they're not
gonna do it and like you said it starts
with the people but the people at the
club don't know what to even do so who's
gonna do it I don't know I'll buy that
bitch and turn it up oh hey do we get
money and hook it up but I shouldn't do
what you got to do so it's dark
oh no oh the lights work now all right
turn the lights on oh I feel like a diva
why are you wait okay so um
next topic so I was told about this
video some person on YouTube did uh he
explained the video because basically
the video is making a mockery and fun of
alia most most the videos basically
about left eye and their tragic deaths
as well as the plane I mean the plane
crash the car accident that brandi was
in where some of the women lost her life
and they basically made fun of that
video in a way where I'm if you make fun
of death all the time people talk about
Michael Jackson's death all the time but
the way in which it was done it was done
in a very disparate in disrespectful way
and they thought that it was okay and I
really
because they're basically a YouTube fail
and they're trying to find a way to
garnish the audience all right and I
just felt it was very techie that's like
you being a great like dancer for the
like you a Laker girl and then you
degrade yourself and you become a porn
star you know that's how you did you
basically yeah what's the point you know
and I thought it was very disrespectful
I don't think that it's anything it's
plenty of anybody's watching this and
you lost somebody my heart goes out to
you cuz I don't think it's a no type of
funny to make fun of someone's death cuz
they're for something that you don't
come back from that's not like a scar a
scab a gunshot or anything that's
something that you don't come back from
so you really need to watch what you say
and how you say it and if you're doing
it for last and shits and giggles you
never know who could be after you or
want to whoop your ass on the streets
for some shit like that I'm just saying
I think it's very desperate to like
especially meet me you know a TLC fan
everybody knows that and a brandy fan
like that that kind of hurt my feelings
it's just like a fucked-up bad situation
like why why would you do that like are
you really that desperate to have
fucking people follow you and Aria
subscribe to your videos because they're
not watching right it's like I'm gonna
try whatever I have to do in order to
get people to watch my videos that's
what I'm have to do when you claim that
you don't even care you care right like
it's just you if something if something
is wrong with you obviously like you're
not funny you're not you're there's
something about you people don't like
anymore
and I'm not saying that cuz I don't like
you I don't know you I don't give a fuck
about you but if people don't like you
obviously that's not why they're
watching so you don't have to go out and
make fun of fucking people's death like
I just find it appalling
I finally nepali you should die 800
that's it you should die I'm over now
let me watch over you too person just
died and nobody cared like three people
watch the video that's wrong I mean and
it's really sad to the point where it's
like it's okay to talk about what you
want to talk about and the only reason
why we're not saying this particular
person's name is because this is what
they're what they want they will thrive
off of this and I'm not gonna do it and
only reason why we even brought up the
subject is because of the people who it
was pertaining to her me
made him being a very big ugly offender
hard being the TLC fans we thought they
need to say and we all be in brainy fans
we felt the need to say something about
yeah and on top of all that it's just
the fact that it's death in general
rather it wasn't even the people that we
like it's just in general I don't think
it's funny
because when they say that Osama bin
Laden was dead and people were praising
in her and I'm saying he was a bad man
but at the end of the day he was still a
person right people care for him right
he has a family too so whether you felt
certain ways about him the person is
still gone and to be praising someone
because they're dead now it's just
really disrespectful now or trying to be
funny about it it's just disrespectful
it's not funny you know that's not cool
like it's a certain point where you have
to stop and say okay now you taking it a
bit far right and I think you're used to
because we have so much freedom we're
allowed to do things but on top of that
the person was using copyrighted
material right love you have icon keep
it out yeah like vodka make sure you
keep that video because they're using
your material just to let you know and
that's against u2's rules and their
whole channel uses other people's
material so you know I'm saying come
check it out you know check it out check
it suspend all that bullshit cuz it
should be on the planet this
disrespectful and I think that people
need to learn it's okay to have freedom
of speech and freedom of choice and
things of that nature but when you
honestly feel some type of you don't
feel nothing behind it it says a lot
about you as an individual but you feel
nothing you think this is funny and
you're doing this sort of video views'
imagine what you would do for some money
imagine what you would do if somebody
was gonna give you something you know
but then you don't want to talk about
the person that you lost and the things
that you went through right and while
you are in a situation that you are in
no right no you don't want to do that
right while you were basically neglected
as a child right
watching you tells you to write write oh
this is gonna be a killer I don't know
the president question I they just know
better and you say anything to me I will
shut job will geek huh well you know
he's already coming me fella
watch your mouth okay anyway that's all
we have to say I know it's probably
gonna be a little low-key backlash
because it was the truth and I think
people need to understand about YouTube
in general and the things that people
say like I wouldn't outright disrespect
nobody you know just because of the fact
and this is our freedom of choice of
meat or we can do what we want to do you
know we don't have we don't answer to
anybody if you don't like it don't watch
that's just the bottom line I'm not here
to please everybody so if I was to do a
video or say something that you don't
like why are you following why are you
watching what is the point
wait would you like something so if
you're gonna come and complain bitch
leave I don't give a fuck to be so very
honest with you it's not gonna make a
difference because for all the people
who dislike you there are way more
people who like you and it can ride with
you on that I'm not for everybody she's
not for everybody he's not for everybody
so just like the people that got mad at
me for me going off in my last video all
girl was coming at me felt I could give
a fuck if you didn't agree with me and
if I was a rude bitch and I need to
watch my mouth who are you what do you
do bitch because at the end of day every
time I click on a bitch you got a smart
mouth page no videos no bio nothing but
a name is some favorites so you ain't
got no opinion I could give a fuck you
still talking though you still talking
and you still come into my shit watching
what the fuck I gotta say and you still
getting butthurt over shit that I gotta
say so obviously I'm a factor within
your life and even our district on leave
I don't give a fuck do you think did you
honestly think I care cuz if I really
care what you said I would have been
changed my channel it don't make no
difference and I'm the reason
honesty the reason why I'm as far as I
am right now is because people fill me
on what I have to say versus they
sitting back and just kissing my ass
that's just bottom line I'm not asking
you to agree with everything that I have
to say but respect what I have to say on
my shit that's the difference</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
