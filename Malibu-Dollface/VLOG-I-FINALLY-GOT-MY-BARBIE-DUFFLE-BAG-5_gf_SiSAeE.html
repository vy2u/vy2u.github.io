or needing to do my hair but anyway um
as you guys can see I finally got the
damn bag that I cried over was mad about
feel like I was betrayed by ebay for
finally got after you guys know if you
watch my eBay rent video the FDA ran I
waited four long years for this bag
because I procrastinate it when it first
came out in 2009 for Barbies 50th
anniversary and it's the Barbie
generations of Dreams duffel bag and you
guys don't have to told in the dolls and
all of that good stuff and I wanted this
to just complete my collection finally
got it
only pay sixty one dollar I think CC 118
was shipping and everything and still
had the plastic on the handles when I
got it still has a Barbie tag on it
after all these years it still smell
fresh like I just got it from Barbie
Collector calm so I am super ecstatic
thank you to everybody who actually hit
me up to seen this on the listing on
eBay and actually claim with a clock and
a 50th anniversary pin the clock is the
generations of Dreams clock as well and
which I wasn't expecting but I basically
paid what it was listed for on Barbie
Collector four years ago plus shipping
so well shipping included so I actually
made out like a bandit the bag is huge
it has pink lining just like my other
one in the inside I'm so ecstatic I want
to give a shout out a special shout out
to glamour doll joy because she sent me
the listing for this and I had not
checked my my youtube um messages so had
I not been like a you Bay stalker for
this bag I would have missed it but
thank you joy I appreciate it and also
my last video you guys were asking me
about where did I get the bow from and
the actual bow is not a bow it's this
Barbie 50th anniversary scarf um that I
tie it into a bow and people keep asking
for a tutorial so if you want like a bow
tutorial yeah hit me up but you guys I'm
so excited to have this in my life like
