virgin color virgin hair okay so this is
a natural black like it so it would be
like a1 b2 as you can see it's like a
natural color it's not but it's
definitely not SuperDuper light is this
is my lage they said this is 100%
Malaysian hair y'all and you guys know I
don't really dabble in Malaysian too
much but yeah this is definitely 100%
Malaysian hair it looks like it's uneven
because I'm gonna tell you why when I
parted it I parted it to be like I had
curled it just to kind of see how it was
gonna look and then I have put a middle
part then I didn't like the curls so I
took it out and try to make it a side
part then making a side part I tried to
re even it out and it's still uneven as
you can see it's longer on the inside
than it is on this side but if I go like
this you know it's probably my
screenshot for the video you can't tell
um but it has no combs and it has no
adjustable strap in the back which I
don't really like because short hair
like Bob's and stuff like that you need
an extra little security because usually
when I hair is longer has a little more
weight on it so it allows your wig to
stay in place but when it's light like
this it wants to kind of sit up like
this in the back because it's nothing
like kind of weighing and down or
pulling it down so that's one of the
hang-ups of it I don't like another one
was the fact that when I did curl it it
held a curl but it's just so short that
it doesn't really look attractive really
short like that like it's just not a
good look
um the they especially make a wig for me
but they gave me a reference of a
picture that they use of someone else
and she had like a side part and it was
kind of like a natural wave in it which
was cute for her but for me it just did
not work but you guys know I've never
had like a middle part of like could
it's not a bob
it's definitely long all the way around
you can see it's not above it's long all
the way around which I do like and
usually when I wear Bob's I tend to wear
them with a side part not a middle part
they categorize this as a long bob
because of the length usually Bob's are
from chin to shoulder that's usually
considered about anything longer it gets
a like in a hybrid name like you guys
never when I had the long bar it was
like really short like this in the back
but there was real long that was
considered a long bob but so is this but
this is not nowhere near as long in the
front as the other one was so he just
depends from company to company
they're from Vivi Beauty here calm I've
never worked with them before but I do
like the hair see the only thing about
like hair styles like this I don't like
is the fact that they I can't really do
much with it after I'm done with it like
this everywhere I you guys know I try I
should take a picture of it I tried to
curl it and it kind of gave me moms
Mabley which I hate um so I didn't want
to go for that it is and then I tried to
kind of bump it a little bit but then it
look like a girl that was going for her
school pictures which I'm not trying to
go for that look either so the only way
I would suggest for me personally to
wear this hair if it was evened out
because I couldn't repart it but you
guys know how you you get awakened I
already has a part in and then you kind
of relay it and then you find like I got
a now like changes apart
so then what ends up happening is you
got to redo all that over again I don't
feel like doing it so we're not gonna do
that but I what else could I do with
this you know what I think if I made
this a color it probably would make a
world of a difference in how I thought
about it if they had any type of
anything done to it besides it being
just black so maybe I should just put
like a coloring because I like the way
that it frames my face I do like the wig
itself I just wish it have some combs in
it and an adjustable strap but other
than that um I do really like this like
I can't lie I like this cuz it's
different from me you know I've used the
80 mm inches long and that's how I like
to wear my hair cuz that's just my
reference but um something like this for
somebody who's just like especially for
the summer because y'all
hot and not that I live in a valley and
I'm gonna stay in LA anymore it's hotter
so yeah it's just I like this I just
don't love some things about it was
usually anything and everything you
always find a hang-up in something but
what you guys think guys like this but
if you I mean if you're interested you
know go ahead and because remember okay
so you guys know I had did a video and I
had a side part and I don't put it right
here brown and gray black but it was
several times what I loved it I think
that we joke and it's it says a lot but
it's short it's not long mane of hair
and I get it like I always say everybody
isn't into that type of here I get it
that what I'm trying to do shorter but I
think I'm gonna do like another short
week cuz I like my last one so I think
I'm sure they're doing like another
short wig like that for y'all so y'all
can kind of see me in a different light
and something a little bit different but
right now I'm feeling like I look like
Brandi um just a little bit you know
like it's Brandi likes wigs that are
usually like this um or Atika some not
looks-wise but just wig wise okay I know
I don't look like Brandi or cheaper son
I got but yeah like that but let me know
what you guys think is different for me
I know I know nice and it's it's very
soft hair it's not thick or it's not too
bulky because of time what I have a
problem with with a lot of short
hairstyles that are like this that I
usually say no to is that when you see
them on a mannequin
they look very Whiggish like so they
don't lay flat like this at the top they
just look very Whiggish and you feel
like this it don't look natural and it
is short why why can't you make a short
wig look as natural as you can along
with if that makes any sense well yeah
um let me know what you guys think of
this wig and then I'll put the info to
this wig below and then give me a color
y'all I need a color because this is jet
black
like Mick Jagger like you know saying
like I need some little pizzazz to this
and I'm a real most recent or this part
to its cuz clearly it's not even at all
but that's not here nor there
you don't do this so if you guys are
interested in this and just look below
for the link to this wig and I'll talk
to y'all later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
