review what I'm going to review rather
my big nice curly I like to call this my
hippie my hippie hair cuz I have on my
Barbie glasses from wild fox so I feel
like this is kind of like my hippie hair
um I like it because it's curly but it's
not like a uniform curl is kind of like
a wild you know everyday curl which I
love so I'll give you guys a specs on
this hair and keep watching if you're
interesting this is from of course Wow
African I think this is the last I think
this is the second review I've done for
them for actual like wet day I have in
four bundles of hair I have in 220 for a
20 in an 18 and gonna have a closure I
have a sub base closure which I have a
16 inch sub base closure so this is my
subway's closure and then the closure
matches the hair texture I did a little
cutting but I didn't cut much off
because I still wanted you guys to kind
of see the state it was in and I didn't
brush it all the way out because I
wanted you to like see how the hair was
like before you brush it but it there
you go like it's nice like if you
brushed the actual curl part out like
this gives you like this big bushy wave
if you guys follow me during the myspace
days then you guys nice to wear my hair
like this all the time it just wasn't as
long it was a little shorter than it is
but yeah you saying like that your
paddle brush or whatever and if you want
to just go through it and brush through
it to kind of get this out to give it
more of this you see as I'm doing it
it's just getting bigger rider standing
I don't believe this here I'm sure it's
not virgin hair um but it is there Milan
curl is what it's called and this hair
is really full you get
it has like this little spiral each
bundle is like a spiral or whatever I
didn't take any pictures of the hair
when I first received it but you'll see
um you should see on the site it has
like this spiral curl to it or whatever
and then I just took my wand and did
kind of this right here just so it would
match because it was still like it was
kind of like on this side it was like
really flat and then and went into it
and I don't like that when they gave me
when it came they came with these flexi
rods for free these are just the smaller
ones I don't use these kind I actually
use more these so these but I see why
they put them for this if you want like
a tighter curl that's kind of last then
yeah I was most likely wear it use these
opposed to these these is probably when
I do my hair like I don't have those
like big waves that's what I use these
okay so you guys can use our code Malibu
to get $10 off any silk based closure or
weave bundles the hair color is a one is
a natural so it's pretty much like oh
it's a 1b I have a subways closure again
it's 16 inches is a 4 by 4 inch my hair
bundles are 18 or 22 or 24 and a 24 this
is a virgin Peruvian hair can be dyed to
any color I didn't die today or any
color I would like but I do like my
natural hair like this like this bow to
stay more of on a darker side I can do
like a red or a blue or something but I
don't like to do it on curly hair that I
personally lifted because you know when
you lift curly hair the curl pattern
leaves if it's not done correctly so I
don't want to mess up no good here but
the hair is really nice I wore this hair
for like 3 days I can take it off so
it's not like I've slept in it but if
you was asleep in it or if I would you
have a sewing with this I will put it in
4 sections and then break them down when
I go to sleep so when I get up it will
preserve my curl pattern but yeah if you
guys have any questions about this hair
let me know I should be wearing this
hair on and off a lot of next year cuz I
do like you guys know I have like my
tighter curl and then I have my looser
curl and then I have this curl so you
guys know I love this so if you guys
really like this hair this is
looks like close up if you wanted to
know it is big and it's fluffy and it's
two mice this is what it kind of looks
like before you really comb it all the
way out this is what you would get so
yeah it's really pretty though I like
this it's like a pillow you know but
yeah if you guys have any questions or
whatever just let me know and I will put
all the link in all the information
below and I will talk to you guys later
bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
