initial review for a new company that I
don't think that I knew but I new to
them I've never worked with them before
but it is a virgin hair fix why didn't I
think his cult virgin hair face um as
you can see there at the bottom and I
just want to give you guys kind of
because I get a lot of questions about
curly hair and I know this course back
then it's always curly hair so I do want
to kind of show you guys what it looks
like is a lot of times mom when I do
videos and I have curly hair people
always inquire like why did you get it
to say how did it come how do they look
so we're not preservative this is the
information that they sent with it from
virgin hair picks and it says hair care
instruction again I told you guys before
do not skimp on these if that company
sends you hair care instructions follow
them to a tee
so to the hair so I have this is a
Malaysian curly this is a 20 to 20 a
closure and this is a 24 so my longest
bundle is a 24 let's look at these shall
reap 15 good time so this is the
Malaysian curly just rid of you
it's spring key I love this it's very
similar to what happened right now I'm
just not as my hair just not as tight
okay so this is the hair these are the
West which are they look very low
constructed by myself
um the beards are very very good they're
not really bad at all it's a few but
it's crazy
you guys know I don't like to co wash my
curly hair when I first get it because I
want to see how it's going to act in its
natural state then I put water on it
you see I really egg oh yeah this is
it's a natural brown I don't know if you
can tell but the hair I happen is a
natural brown to it so as you can see it
really does match um once you take this
out now I know a lot of times when
people get curly here they see it like
this and I think it's going to look like
this and it's not it once you pull this
apart it's going to be
kind of like this it's going to be like
an onion inform just big curly kind of
main so this my longest one is a 24 and
so that means that it will be back here
so yeah it'll probably be around the
same length is what I have in right now
it's kind of gone going to be a bigger
look but what I'm gonna do is I don't
think I'm into a side part with this one
I think I'm gonna go ahead and either do
a little part or just let it free flow
to kind of see how it acts so let's look
at the closure because curly closures
seem to be some like an issue with
people they give them and they don't
know what to do with them or they don't
know how to blend them to make them look
um like the rest of the hair I'll make
it look natural so let's keep it that
way
oh this is a curly closure this is a me
think us lace closure list here it's
lace or it's two please it is lace
okay but okay you guys know so this
matches so let me grab the hair so this
definitely is gonna match the hair that
they sent which is great and you guys
noticed that the links are a little bit
straighter just like mines are a little
bit straighter and then it goes into the
curly and it has its curly this is like
the best curly closure I've seen though
because it very is mimicking that hair
very well sometimes the closures be a
little on the wavy side for curly hair
and I'll be like okay so now I gotta get
one on our curling iron to make this
match which kind of sucks um but no this
match is just is very rabbi I like that
though oh yeah it looks like it's gone
apart very easily to which sometimes
when you get curly hair and the yeah
this one's already kind of like part
itself sometimes when it's our curly
hair it's so dense at the top that it
doesn't want to part or anything but
smell some music it smells really good
and once you kind of run your fingers
through this like if I do this you'll
notice as the hair starts to kind of get
this like bushiness to it but it's like
a natural bushy so it's they're not so
uniform this kind of scares people when
they see like the Sigma I don't
want to look like I have in like a Giri
girl and it's not going to look like
that if you take your fingers and pull
them apart that's like the best tip that
I could ever get ready when you curling
hair always pull it apart unless you're
going for that rabbi uniform curl but if
you're not then yeah so all my bundles
actually match the curl pattern
sometimes the pro pattern be off for
some but this actually seems like they
all match this is a 20 this is the 22 so
y'all made up with like a nice curly
Mane like a very lion esque
would you look arms yeah I can't wait to
put this in though because as of right
now you guys can see you guys know I'm
very one for a lot of curly I mean a lot
of straight hair but as of right now I'm
really feeling I'm curling it up like I
really am and this hair just kind of set
it off you know I'm saying the whole
curly movement so yeah I'm gonna see
what I can do with this um and then I
know a lot of you guys are asking me
about curly color hair but I don't want
to do that because I would rather get
some 613 here and color it and it's
already curly didn't lift in the hair
and most of the hair that you get if you
put her it was curly a you put color on
it it'll go back to its natural state
but I just don't like to disturb my
curly hair like that like that's why I
don't like to straighten it anymore I
just like to keep it how it is the
tighter the curl the better is gonna
last longer tight you know so so far so
good virgin hair thick rubber child
before but I'm similar we gonna have a
nice little partnership popping up
because already I'm already like in this
hair even the ends I let me show y'all
even the ends and this is kind of the
issue with curly hair people have the
ends are not brassy in like they curl
all the way to the end sometimes I see
people put their bundles on Instagram
and it be straight from here down and
that's not curly here now you could tell
the hair has been processed of some
sorts now processing of hair varies um
because it depends if it was a natural
process like a steam process or who was
a chemical process usually what is a
chemical process you can smell it no
matter how many times they wash the hair
how many times
you wash there it's you can still smell
it in the hair which is terrible
so yeah I'll keep you guys posted so the
actual review for this is coming and
I'll catch on the next - I just look how
it's totally from the root which is very
real
okay so I'll catch you guys in the next
one and I will talk to y'all later
