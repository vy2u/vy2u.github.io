hair which is from let me get it this
time virgin hair fix and this is their
Malaysian curly I really do enjoy this
now I'm gonna tell you who my
inspiration was for a couple of these
looks this looks specifically was
Brandis during the hip-hop Awards and
she had like the long flannel Kate
get down home and in her hair was much
tighter than mines and it was much more
uniformed it was like more of a big fro
type feel but that's what I was feeling
with this and then the other person that
I kind of I always loved their hair was
Claudette Ortiz from City High alright I
mean it's hers you know so clearly I
can't replicate it that well but I do my
best so to this hair I have in a soup
base closure I mean no don't I have an
ace lace closure and then I have in four
bundles and I think my longest bundle is
a 24 against the 22 and 20 and 18 and I
think my closure is a 16 but if I am
wrong about any of that information that
I just said the correct information will
definitely be below and it should have
been in a beginning of this video so I
went for it like I told you guys in the
initial review I was gonna go for more
of this free-flowing don't really care
Scary Spice get down because I just
wanted something that was just very
simple and to the point and you know I
mean I would say right now the weather
this would you die with this cuz it's
like being a little mangy mutt it's a
lot of hair forth whether you would die
okay just from a heat stroke around your
neck but when it does get cooler this
kind of works you know I'm giving you
like you know what East LA chola
realness you know I could shake you son
you know something like that that's what
I'm kind of feeling with this as far as
the hair goes the hair was very
you to install I didn't give me any
issues any problems nothing of that sort
what I kind of don't like is the fact
that this closure is really really curly
but this hair is very very wavy and it's
curly too but it's like you see this is
more of a bouncy or curl this is more of
a uniform curl and if I this is more
like a warm curl and then this you know
so I don't want it to kind of look like
a palm tree so that's why I keep on
trying to flip this out but aside from
that um it does kind of give you a very
natural feel now this definitely is very
different from what I'm used to rocking
and it is very it's very lightweight it
moves a lot um it wasn't I didn't put
anything in it as of yet I did Co wash
it though um after I did my initial
review and then I let it air dry so this
is what it looks like after it's been
air dry and it hasn't really changed the
texture much it relaxed a little bit
more than it was when I first received
it because they were very uniform as you
can see in that video when I first took
them out but as of right now it is more
relaxed more of a natural feel you know
our girl or even a guy looks very
naturally big curly like just oily curly
hair this is what their hair usually
looks like the shedding for this has not
been much in with curly hair and
sometimes later here these are looking
for shedding it does tend to be a lot
but as of right now it hasn't been too
much of anything again for those who are
asking or new hair I do not wear weaves
I only wear wigs
so therefore I don't lay on this hair
because of course when you lay on it
flattens out curl and each other
reviving me use crow cream and all this
other stuff it just becomes very taxing
on the hair and then you have to wash it
and it just is a lot so I don't like to
put a lot of product and more curly hair
as well as I do not sleep so again my
experience with curly hair or this hair
in particular will be very different
from somebody who's actually tying it
down in
night and sleeping on it and showering
with it and going to the gym with it I
just take it off and put it on my
dresser if once I get ready to go to
sleep so that when I get up it still has
the same look to it I find that wigs are
more much easier than the sewing is less
pain - so for you guys who are not very
well-versed in wearing wigs try it out
because it will definitely not only will
save your hair but it will save your
pockets as well so remember that I do
not wear so in so your experience with
this if you're going to get a soda in
will be very different from mines
it has a nice luster to it it's not too
shiny like sometimes when you get curly
hair it'd be like whatever the sealant
that they put on top of the hair it
makes it look real real plastic and you
have to end up co washing it or putting
some dry shampoo in it so that it could
look a little more on the natural side
um I probably what I'm gonna probably do
is take my wand and one the rest it is
here to match the top because I love how
the closure looks and I love how this
looks I just don't like the fact that
they don't match but it's a give or take
now when I initially did it it looked
like they would match and again the more
I put my fingers through this the more
it's gonna kind of connect and become
one unit you know so the more you
separate it and not try not to disturb
don't do this because you're gonna start
tearing the curls out but just pull them
apart like this and then it would just
start to make the hair bigger and it'll
start to just separate and become this
nice lion's mane so I do like this I do
it's very different for me and uh ever
since I had seen a performance of brandy
I really did love her hair if I wanted
that look I'll have to go with some very
like really tight curly hair and then
I'll have to wash it and co wash it and
then let it air dry and kind of pick it
out just a tad because her crow pattern
was much smaller than this these are
like pretty big curls which I do like
too so it's kind of the alternative for
that look some people don't like to wear
their hair like this because some of
some people feel like they start looking
like
James and it's very easy if you cut it
like some people I've seen what they've
done is they'll get their curly hair and
then they'll cut the front part like
right here and it becomes like a bang a
thick curly bang so you start trying to
starting to look like a shaggy dog and
some people can pull off the shaggy dog
look I'm just not one of them but this
is definitely enough bundles I could
actually got away I didn't use all my
hair either I think I still have a half
of my top bundle I still have because I
couldn't get it to fit but I also just
didn't want it to be ridiculously tight
at the top where it looked like a wig
like I wanted to still have like these
you see the spaces you can see my
forehead right here that's what I wanted
to keep in I didn't want to just be hair
everywhere and one of my favorite
singers is police and police will wear
hair like this very often it just will
be in a color and so I would love to do
this in a color so if I could find some
6:13 curly hair like this and I could do
like the caught out there look I would I
would be so excited yeah if you guys
like this make sure you guys check the
the links below and you know any
questions I'm asked me on Instagram it's
usually easier for me to answer mine so
Graham did it here it is on YouTube I'm
really bad at responding on here because
there's just so many people and
sometimes YouTube don't want even let me
after I reply so many times they won't
let me reply to everybody which is kind
of dumb but yeah but make sure you guys
hit me up below and then we can go from
it so I hope you guys enjoyed this and I
will talk to y'all from the next month</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
