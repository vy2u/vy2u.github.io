ever so this is my virgin hair fix hair
so this will be kind of like my final
review not my final time we're in this
Tristan believe back because you guys
know that Love &amp;amp; Hip Hop Hollywood
starts on September 7 so I have a new
hairstyle for each episode some of new a
lot of them will be old phase so to this
week so you guys know that I made this
week I showed you guys with the hair
look like when I initially got it
I did my review for it and I have been
wearing the stank off of it and it's
because it's something different and
like I told you guys I didn't want it to
be defined I want it to be very natural
very big very flowy just something that
I could throw on and go and that's
exactly what I've been doing even though
it is ridiculously hot I still have been
wearing his hair and believe it or not I
haven't had no issues with his hair the
only thing that I did to it different
since the last time that you guys see me
and I came on camera with the hair was
remember I told you that the closure
part and this part wasn't really a great
match in my opinion but now you see
everything seems like one big cohesive
unit and that's because I simply use my
wand like I said I was gonna do I wanted
the bottoms of it and then I let them
follow my sister's birthday was it was
on Sunday she had a party Saturday and
I'm sure you guys could see in the
screen right now the pictures from her
party I was here then and I was all the
way in Palmdale which if you guys are
not from California are not familiar
with Palmdale is much further further
further in the valley that's just in the
boonies and it was very hot but it was
that night so it wasn't as hot but I did
go to my other friend's house after that
who did have air and I did
I died I was sweating so bad but because
winter is coming up this is great this
is like I know some people's like always
kind of like very rigged jamish and then
Rick James ish and then somebody said I
had my glasses on in those pictures and
semi-solid they thought I was mad with
Jackson
I don't care I legit love this because
it's so effortless and I think I love
things like you guys know I'm I love a
good laid wig and I love a good lay
situation but nothing beats a very
effortless situation like this and
before I actually wanted it I did Co
wash it just just to make sure that
everything would be Co he said once I
curled it because sometimes what happens
is the curls are defined and sometimes
that when once you co wash or wash it
the curl pattern to change a little bit
so I wanted to make sure that that
wasn't the issue
neither beforehand so that wasn't it it
went it was exactly the same so I wanted
the curls all together and because my
hair it made my hair shorter yes it did
but what I didn't wanted to do was I
didn't want to wand it and it'd be these
long Shirley Temple curls and yet this
was at the top was still the same you
know nothing really matched so when you
rhond your hair and this is how I do it
just so that it'll last a little bit
longer if you guys if I pull these you
can see how long they really are like
that so when I rwandan him I will wand
them into each other and then pull them
out and then let them sit so I'll let
him sit I did her party was Saturday and
I did a Thursday night so I let it sit
all the way Friday and most of Saturday
so when I put it on i legit pulled this
apart and it just became this big curly
mane you know it was already dead but it
feels more uniform to me it all feels
like one unit okay but yeah so far it's
so good
no shedding and I think I don't think
people get when we do hear review quote
I don't know why everybody else before
me when I do hear reviews I don't never
talk about the hair or show the hair or
mention the hair until I know for a fact
I'm going to
view it so it's usually a two to three
week interval before you even see it
before there's anything talked about
then there's another two weeks of me
wearing the hair after the review then
there's another two weeks when I come
and do an update then there's another
two so it all ends up spiraling down to
be a couple of months but because I'm
working on so many different things at
one time and I have so many different
hairstyles in May it looks like I have a
different hairstyle for every day and
technically I do play I give each review
individual time because I can't say that
I love some hair that I'm only wore one
time you know that's why with this hair
you guys are seeing it a lot or when I
had that are traditionally with the
middle part and I wore it today I walk
off camera I want my hair way more than
our weird horn camera so because I'm
doing so many different things but if
you guys noticed last year when I did
love in here by Hollywood you guys seen
a lot of your favorite wig talk back up
because you were seeing that I was you
know consistently wearing this I just I
feel like a new person every day so I do
a different thought everything that's
the great thing about wigs so before I
have this week to know that I've been
talking about for freaking ever I wanted
to go do a like a last round of some of
my favorites so you'll see a lot of my
old wigs or old you parts or whatever
it's been in this new season of Love &amp;amp;
Hip Hop Hollywood reviews but I did want
to come because this is something that I
really really really liked like y'all
this is just so everything like there's
not anything better than I can say and I
see that a lot of you guys have brought
from a virgin hair face before you guys
love your hair so I'm happy I love when
the customers are happy
I have no negativity thank God up from
any customers because what I want you
guys to also understand about reviews
and stuff like that is that don't just
take my opinion for because my
experience is not always the same of
someone else's you how you can't I can't
be your holy grail of what you like
about hair I get it and I totally
appreciate it but understand when you
are
looking to purchase hair out of your own
pocket look at my reviews look at so
many other people's reviews look at not
just reviewers but look at actual
customers as well because that would
definitely help with your purchase
whenever I buy anything whether it be
Apple whatever I look at everybody I
don't look at just the people who get it
for free from Apple or have a deal with
a tech company that's going to send it
to them I look at the actual customers
who brought the actual product as well
so that helps as well because as a
reviewer I can only go by my personal
experience and you know I'm that's
usually that's all I can do I can't tell
you how the hair is going to be six
months from now because I can't even put
the hair back in until another three
months after I've had it because I wore
all this other hair but look at somebody
who's worried consistently for six
months and see how their hair looks you
know it all depends so you have to do
your homework because I know I do
before I buy anything I love you know
I've had it for a while so so far so
good
after washing I can tell and usually
curly hair is much easier to upkeep
because the luster you ain't gotta worry
about the luster and it being late or if
it want to be straight it just does what
it does now if the curl patter fall out
that's the problem but so far so good
so make sure you guys check out virgin
hair fix and I will catch you guys later
