really just don't continue to change our
hair color like every week and that's
not true because I had gray for like
three weeks
it wasn't the same wig but it was still
great you know all right
so whatever um I'm here to talk about
this beautiful fiery red hair this ombre
red hair that I have right now now you
guys need to know um I'm not really one
for color but um this particular company
that hit me up which was called which is
called virgin hair obsession they hit me
up and said you know we really want to
work with you and they were very
persistent which I love and you guys not
get a lot of reviews so something that
you have to say no and this was one of
the companies that I did count out in
the beginning because I wasn't really
too sure nationally about who they were
as individuals but just really you know
just like there's so many reviews just
that I have to do so I have to be very
pretty much picky about who I review for
now at once I wasn't like that so they
had um told me to take a look at the
site and I did and I seen his hair and
really wanted to do it because I was new
I was about to come off the gray hair
and I was like you know I really want to
try some red cuz I have not been red
since I left my beauty school and I
think when I left there was 2006 so I
haven't had any like red hair and it's
what's really fun this summer getting
into colors and stuff like that so and
so the my wanted the red so what I ended
up getting was a 2022 wait I think I
have I think uh you know what I'm not
gonna even go to it myself
I'm gonna just put it down below so you
can know which photos I have and I have
I know I have four bundles though and I
have a lace closure as well I think the
communication got a little bit long
because in the email I asked him that
they have still base closures and she
did say that they did buy ended up with
a lace closure and I'm one of those
people that don't necessarily like to
have to wait for something to have to be
sitting back and we delivered so I just
kind of left it alone because I mean
it's not like they did not send me a
closure at all it just wasn't the one
that I had hoped for because I feel like
if this was a subway's closure this
install would be like perfect though um
so yeah besides that this color I love
like I'm obsessed um and I don't really
say that much when it comes down to
color but the only other color that I
felt this strongly about was my gray
hair and I did that myself um this hair
that I have in right now did not um did
not have to become about me when I got
the color it was this coming when I got
the color when I got the hair it was
already this color which is great
because you guys know I am about sick of
dying and frying and trying to yeah I'm
over it so the fact that it was already
done it came out to package like this
everything was all one color it was even
it's very full which I love is very very
full and when you have colorful hairs
like stuff like this to have thin that
colorful hair is it just makes you look
wretched so I mean this is ratchet red
you know it's very k.michelle but I love
it so when I received the package you
came in this pink um shipping package
like such and then it had has this at
the bottom I'm listening this is cheetah
yeah I believe this cheetah print and
then it was in I think my closure was in
here and then my bundles were in here if
I'm not mistaken when I got it which is
great because I love that they put that
special touch because you're gonna reuse
those bags for things like that and I
will be reusing those when I take um my
hair off of this you part now this you
part that I have right now if you guys
are not aware when I do my hair
you guys I don't wear so ends anymore
because I changed my hair way too often
to be throwing in and cutting out a
thread all the time
so what I do is I usually get like a
dome cap and I put the dome cap on use
some white eyeliner trace out where my
braids are and then I sew around that
and then cut you know the extra pieces
off after I sew it down but I have seen
on my fellow youtuber here on YouTube
miss diva like have posted some you like
caps that are made for you parties so I
was like I want to try those because
sometimes with Hispanics caps they do
sometimes or at least for me I make my
you parts to look too small because when
you start to sew hair on any object it
starts to tighten so it's sometimes I've
been pulling for dear life and I
remember I don't know what install I did
but I remember my hair was so tight it
was ridiculous because of the fact that
I made it too small and I did not feel
like we're doing it so I used a new cap
and I really do love this cap the only
downside about the can I'll post the
caps somewhere right here well I got two
different ones but I used one to
actually have the cutout in it um the
only thing I don't like is the fact that
they don't come in sizes so this one's
fixed like exact and I would like for if
it was a little bit bigger that would be
great but you know but I do like them
though it was it was definitely worth
the money because it gave me an
opportunity to have a to not have to
because when I take off you parts from
our old units they pretty much are like
a spandex pair you know it has no form
to it so I like this so I'm happy that
virgin hair obsession is the first hair
that I'm you know that I can make a unit
with on those new caps um this hair I
try I co washed one bundle of the hair
just to kind of see if it the color
would bleed and no it did not bleed as
you can see it's still all one color and
I have not added any color or anything
on my closure all this is a closure all
this in the front all this I have no
hair left out except for my edges
right here but other than that no none
of this is mines
so yeah the closure is actually really
nice they did a very good job with
matching the closure to the actual hair
so there is seamless and you can't tell
and yeah I love this I absolutely love
this I'm happy that I did give them a
chance and I really do like the hair the
quality is great I don't know if you can
tell but the quality of this hair is a
fern things amazeballs time
so yes as you can see it's really read
on camera it's coming off like a little
redder than it actually is in real life
it's red but it's more of a deeper red
it's coming on very orange II read on
camera but regardless of the fact it's
still very pretty
right now I am holding a Instagram
giveaway with them it's for $100
giftcard
I'm from virgin hair obsession and the
only thing that you have to do is pretty
much follow me follow them repost the
picture and tag two friends at the
bottom and you're automatically entered
we're gonna have two winners and we were
we're going to announce those on August
19 as well as if you make a purchase of
130 dollars or more on their site you
receive a free gift and I know within
that gift one of the things that I think
is really cool is that this company does
custom color so if you want it gray like
I had and you just was scared to do it
or you wanted this color but you don't
have the time to do it but you want red
hair you can buy it from them and they
have all the mermaid colors from their
mermaid collection and what they do is
when you you make the purchase they give
you a sample of their mermaid colors so
if you let's just say you want this what
I like to call the ratchet red and you
wanted to kind of see the quality and
fill the hair and all of that and you
brought some black hair or some curly
hair from them or whatever this is or
you buy red hair and you want to try
pink necks then when you get the gift
you can see the quality of the hair and
what color it is and touch it and fill
in and all that good stuff before you
actually spend your money on it so
that's the great thing that I like about
this because a lot of companies do not
do custom color these days it's very few
that actually will accommodate the
customer to the point where they will
give you the exact color that you're
looking for so if we take a picture of
police or myself or whoever and say I
want this color chances are they'll be
able to do it for you so love that love
that um it took me about mmm about a
week to get my hair didn't take long at
all took about a week I've had the hair
in and installed for probably about four
days at the
to the point but the reason why I
whenever I get here guys I don't never
automatically posted on Instagram I what
I do give it a chance before I just pop
the review up
um but yeah I've had it in for about
four or five days going on a week now
and I absolutely love it I used the arm
a one and a half inch barrel on these
crows now listen this thought of my hand
was done or with the curling irons this
thought was done with flexi rods and I
did this review before earlier and I
didn't like the way that my hair looks
so I kind of like refix it but when I
did it this it was way more defined
these curls were way more defined on
this particular side I'll put like a
snippet of that original video so you
can see how to find this was versus this
I had to try to match this and I don't
do such a hot job because it's just hot
but um
yeah if it's really pretty like really
pretty so this is gonna be my go-to site
for curly hair for sure cuz I hate
having to UM do the color myself unless
it's like a you know and they do ombre I
think they had white and my sisters and
I once white hair so I'm have to let her
know think I weigh it girl um if it's
not white I think it's like blonde like
a really ice blonde whatever but yeah I
like this so if you have any questions
feel free to hit me up on Instagram make
sure that you follow them at virgin hair
obsession on Instagram and virgin hair
of obsessed I think it's just the first
s and it stops I'll put it down below
oh and follow me at Malibu doll face as

whenever I do reviews you guys remember
check out my Instagram because I always
post pictures of what the hair looks
like like on camera that view cry can't
see here but yeah this is I'm giving you
Ariel down on it you know so I love this
it's so pretty I do love it so it's
really pretty and I I haven't did a
middle part in whoa Lord it's been a
minute so I thought this would actually
be very perfect because I'm I'm not
gonna say I'm tired of it I probably
never
but I'm sure you guys are tired of it so
just the truth try something a little
bit different a little bit Sam friend
