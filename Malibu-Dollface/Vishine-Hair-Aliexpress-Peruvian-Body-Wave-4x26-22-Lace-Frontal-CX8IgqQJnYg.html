I believe the company is called by Sean
or vishawn hair on Aliexpress correct me
if I'm wrong but I believe that is right
so this is their peruviana a body way
baby that I put a little bit of rollers
in and then I just kind of let it
air-dry into this nice little wavy
situation so I wearing their Peruvian
body wave I am wearing I believe eight
wrong I must say eight bundles of
28-inch this will look like I had I'm
wearing four bundles of 28-inch and I
believe I'm wearing a 20 inch um lace
frontal that I went ahead and plucked a
little bit it was kind of I want to say
it was pretty plush but not really I'm I
went through and plucked it a little bit
more I bleached the knots of course and
this is what I got from it now what I
did was I put some flexi rods in it if
even though like this I you know I had
to co wash I just like to co wash my
curly hair on my way to here only
because I just feel like sometimes if
you don't you kinda get the wrong
impression out of here because it's
always pretty when you first get is
what's gonna look like after the fact so
I went ahead and co wash did after I did
the wig a kept its curl pattern so I
only put flexi rods in the top area and
then I left this at the bottom how it
as it came so it is dry like he did at
the bottom and I will say and I'm just
gonna go on a limb and say that I really
but this is my favorite body wave like
now this is definitely my favorite body
wave because it looks great as you can
see the god no shedding new shading so I
went ahead and first thing I did of
course was bleach my knots because I
can't make my wig unless my front was
done so I went ahead and did my frontal
and I make it close for y'all and as you
can see I left a little bit of blond at
the root just because I wanted it to
look more like a natural like you can do
it I've done a lot of my other units not
like that but because it was curly hair
I wanted to see how it would look if I
just left a little bit of my roots
blonde because most people's like y'all
from your actual scalp about a half of a
centimeter
it's like transparent and then the color
starts so if you ever put on your hair
so it's kind of white at the ends that's
that's what we're doing here um so
that's what I did and I really do like
that especially for this look I don't
think I would do that necessarily for
straight hair only because straight hair
is just so out like it doesn't have any
texture to it so you definitely will be
able to tell um with that now I will say
that the frontal came very close to my
own hairline which I don't know if the
company did this on purpose they let me
look one of my videos without had a wig
on or something and kind of try to give
me one closer to my hair tomás up to my
hairline because this one actually fits
like it goes to the dividends of what my
hairline would look like where a lot of
times it goes straight across and all of
these little extra piece here that I
have will be sticking out so love that
aspect about it now is this hair any
different from what I've reviewed before
our hair that I've had before I would
say not necessarily only because I feel
like about like I always tell you guys
kind of body wave this body wave it's
not really much that you can say or do
about it as far as the
extra that it is it says that is
unprocessed virgin hair um no I don't
think this is virgin here I'm just gonna
be rule 100 I like to listen everybody
in a mama is selling 100% unprocessed
virgin hair that that term definitely
brings in people for me personally um I
know what um hair that's been tampered
with
smells and looks like and even though
this one doesn't have any smell to it
the the crop powder is too uniform you
know
so if whose crop I don't really looks
like this just being this you know and
even though I put rollers in it it still
was very close especially the bottom is
very close to what it was when I
received it it's a little looser than
what I what it was when I received it
but nobody's a curl pattern is is that
is not that uniform its uniform but in
that you norm
so yeah it's more is this is some very
affordable nice hair that's what I will
say a lot of times I get a lot of emails
or especially on I mean not emails or
messages on snapchat asking this is the
question of the year what would you
suggest for me to get insert lace wig
insert bundles insert whatever here for
that's going to last me a lifetime for a
cheap price and I don't know why people
are under this great impression that a
company is out there selling you hair
that is worth $800 for two hundred and
fifty dollars I don't know um so that
question I never answer unless somebody
has asked me like I'm looking for a
Brazilian body wave that will last me
two to six months and I want to pay two
to six hundred what would you suggest
that's a more proper question then we're
through cheap hair that's really good
cuz that doesn't exist like I don't care
what nobody says it just doesn't exist
every hair every vendor every type of
hair is very different so if you want
some good straight hair the chances are
you have to make sure that you you take
proper
care and you stay on top of your hair
you know a lot of times people don't
understand like for me with curly hair
when I do have it and I'm wearing it
consistently I will co wash my hair at
least twice a week
because I don't want my hair to get
crunchy I don't want all the products
that are in it to start building up
because it will and you end up with this
just matted bundle of a mess you know so
hair can lash you depending on what you
do with it I like this look how nice
this is and look at the luster because I
didn't put nothing in it mm-hmm I didn't
put no water in it I didn't put you know
anything after I took those flexi rods
out I just left them and when I put the
flexi rods in I put a little bit of um a
lot of body which is um if you used it
for like wet sets and stuff like that so
I didn't use any heat on this hair I
left it just like it was and I only used
like a little squirt I didn't use a lot
so I'll turn around so you guys can see
how all of the hair looks in the back so
this is what it looks like from the back
so they get they definitely get an
a-plus for me because I haven't had no
major shedding issues with this hair
thank God and it keeps it holds its curl
you know so these particular flexi rod
curls these waves that were curls have
been in his hair for like two weeks like
legit it would look way more defined if
you would have seen him when I first did
it that's why the bottom is a little bit
more relaxed than the top but yeah it
held and one thing I do is I take it and
I'll go ahead I take it and when I take
them off I'll go ahead and put them on
go ahead this is Caitlin by the way so
yeah I'm I'm I'm loving this this is
again my favorite body wave thus far
it's something a little bit different it
could be just a limp that I'm liking a
little bit more but it's very easy and
go I literally take my brush and brush
my hair and put it on and blew me down
and I'm good so if you guys are
interested in the vision
again I have Peruvian body wave in 4:28
and a either 20 or 22 inch front so lace
fronts on catch on the flip side people
