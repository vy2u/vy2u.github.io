out on Facebook okay so I hope y'all
enjoyed um my little a Spice Girl
reunion moment you know we if you were
part of my era decade uh people um yeah
first before a big part of your life
okay so we're gonna get to my hair and I
know things look a little bit different
tell me how you like this setup versus
the other one coming out more lights and
I got some wrong way okay so um oh and
before I started I know it's gonna be
one raggedy that's gonna say something
this bun is bigger than this one I
didn't realize it when I was doing my
hair but as I got in front of the camera
yeah you can just flip it on this side
okay so it's for the minute since I've
had this here when I say a minute I
receive this hair on January 24 and I
have been wearing this hair up
consistently off-camera to the point
where I forgot I even had it to the
company was I hey um hope you didn't
forget about us I'm like oh god so I had
to I was like okay so I know what hair
this isn't exactly what it was I thought
I had threw this away but apparently I
did not okay so my look was inspired by
Scary Spice um you know who don't love
movies but anyway okay so I'm wearing
their Peruvian curly and it says it is
virgin but it has a they all have this
curl pattern didn't um but I'm going to
tell you this it does hold the original
as you can see the original look to it
with a little bit of art and a little
bit of cream which I use the Garnier
Fructis a curl calm down because you
know once it diffuses it gives me this
more relaxed look versus everything in
my face okay so anyway um this is I
found it at the bottom of my wig bin I'm
going through some ways right now cuz
I'm not to work on some room special for
y'all on August 1st so look out for that
I promise um they sent me four bundles
of 24 inch
I mean 26 inch 26 not 24 26 inch and
they send me a 14 inch a lace closure I
forgot that this was even a closure
until the other day I went to go do this
hairstyle that's what I'm looking for
lace all the way no no lace over there
hey so most of the time the issue that I
have with most of my curly hair is what
I'm sure y'all know cuz I watch these
videos what is one thing I always
complain about when it comes to my curly
hair that my closures are my frontals
never match at the root so hence the
spell I got going on up in here because
it just didn't really work for me um
with any other step I could have
definitely left it and again like I
always say if I have a frontal which I
did not request may ask me um what did I
want they said it did not have a frontal
to match this hair texture but I wanted
to try the hair texture wet so I'm very
happy I did follow that okay fine I'll
just take a closure on the closure with
a kind of long in the tooth with the
roots being so straight so I can what
can I do with this to steam in the style
that's great where I'm not a company
with the hat or headband or you know
anything of that nature just something
that's really nice that I really enjoyed
it out really you know love okay so that
was kind of like my first hurdle I have
wore this hair like the half-up
half-down I've been doing that a lot a
lot uh lately because I like he might be
here but it's been um kinda foot so I'm
trying to find a reason to still be able
to wear big hair because even with
straight hair it is a lot okay it's
really hard and family so Tara since
January I've been wearing it on and off
since then I'm gonna tell you something
I really like this hair and I really
like the company because I will tell you
they have been some of the most patient
people ever um due to one of my lapse in
judgment in a memory I forgot that this
I'm thinking this is some hair that I
already had totally forgot kept
everywhere I'm like what here is this I
don't remember I always tend to want to
look it up and because most of the curly
hair that I have now all have fun
and I put them I categorize them in like
oversized Ziploc bags but this one was
just out and I'm like okay so this is
obviously something that I've already
reviewed it's what I took from it the
move threw me off so what I decided to
do was um just go ahead and knock it out
I've had more than enough time to tell
you my true and honest feelings about
this hair and I will say this hair is
really really really nice
the only hang-up that I have with this
hair the only one that I have is the
closure that's it if you end it okay it
was one more thing too you have to be
sure to UM detangle this hair like any
other curly hair but I'm telling you
this is about the easiest I got like
little to no shedding I did not cut my
left um went up at this end I folded
them over and I will do a video about
that because I think a lot of people
were a little confused is if you had to
cut your own whips and you really don't
I just choose to Lamar's straight hair
because I'm lazy and it just live in it
but um yeah but this is some really like
nice hair and it's not um crazy large
and when you wet it it goes back to this
crinkly look now what you have to do is
get curl cream of any one crop and
conditioner anything both make sure that
you wash and you condition properly
because if you do not your hair will not
look like this and I don't want to get
messages people saying right here came
one of yours and didn't stay like that
the only reason my hair still looks like
this is because every single time I
finish wearing this week I will take it
off and I will wash it um and condition
it just enough sometimes I'll leave the
conditioner for like a week
I online I don't I don't think that's
the most healthy thing to do but just
friend me for curling here because I
don't like when my curly hair turns
nappy on me it's just not a fun
experience you know especially here in
the Nate okay talk about a struggle so I
I don't want to be in that situation so
I definitely really really Oh for those
who are going to ask in the
comments I like to use vales to
condition my good ol I like to use it to
condition my curly hair I use the
condition in my straight hair and I also
use it when I do color and I want to
click um like if I want to pastel a blue
I'll take this and then just mix it
together and then get more of a baby
blue than a covert bulletin
it just helps it definitely it is very
anything I think is holding was like
five books so invest in this not the
dollars to off people because you will
be knocked all the way up from the end
to the root so this isn't definitely an
option I don't know how to say the name
of the company I don't know if it's I
hate but Shaun here or if is like vanish
I don't know what okay call me stupid
call me crazy I don't know but I will
say uh the the customer service was
really nice um they're very sweet very
understanding okay
I don't know if I could be thirst
understanding or whatever but they've
been very understanding I told them you
know when I hit me up about it
um because I did my other I had to some
curly hair from her another company like
it looks really nice but where's our is
it on but yeah I've had enough time to
sit with this hair and I'm telling you
guys if you wash it conditioning this is
by far some of the best Alex first like
curly crinkly hair that I've had in a
long time and you guys know this has
been a struggle for me because trying to
find hair that stays like this is is is
the problem for me okay is I think it's
apart from everybody the only time I
have curly hair that lasts me is from
us-based companies and it could another
from aliexpress company but I don't know
what they did they died they definitely
uh
after a while and you gotta go in with
so much conditioner to make sure that
you get it out and you ain't left with a
bald wig and a ball tracks so um I will
give you guys a B+ because I do not like
my the straightness okay this is a
problem for me I can't wear my hair like
this all the time said I would love some
some curly hair from boom from the root
all the way out and it could be a
literal
but if you like this relaxed I don't
need whose roots are this long like I
don't know nobody because here whose
roots that long so anybody if any
Aliexpress companies are watching it you
are looking to contact me about a review
make sure your curly hair roots are
curly not straight
so again if you guys are interested in
his hair make sure you guys have the
links below and I will catch on Mon X or
birth oh hello
keep it again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
