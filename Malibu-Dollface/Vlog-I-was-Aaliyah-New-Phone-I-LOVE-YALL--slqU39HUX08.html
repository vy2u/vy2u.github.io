like you keep me real pink open a lips
pink okay so basically this is gonna be
kind of like a little update video um
just about just everything I'm doing
it's not a specific topic or anything
you know just people who just want to
know first off let me tell y'all I got a
new phone I got the girl I'm from 5s
y'all don't understand y'all in one case
so somebody wanna be like give me your
phone you I think I wanna you know it's
like that it's cute but it's functional
you know I'm saying if you want to get
stupid um but I want to say that thank
you guys I mean like sixty thousand
subscribers which I had no clue
I just been doing videos not really
paying attention to my numbers or
anything but thank you guys so much and
I mean this from like the bottom of my
heart every last one of you guys who
have watched the video told a friend
subscribed got some inside wanting some
new hair or whatever and as a side note
this is still my April lace wig a wig
that I've been rocking the hell out of
which brings me to my next topic
Halloween I went as the great late and I
killed it the well that's what the
internet said so I'm happy about that a
lot of people went into Lea this year
and um I got voted best costume which is
great cuz I originally was not supposed
to go as alia I was just go as something
else and then my it just didn't fall
through and I was like I want to do
something like I don't want to cuz for
like the last three years I don't think
I've done anything for Halloween from -
Shana no so I was like I really want to
dress up and do something to have fun
with my friends or whatever so we went
to West Hollywood we had a great time
and then I posted pictures on Instagram
and follow me on instagram you've seen
them of me as alia and I really decided
at the last minute to do it but a lot of
the stuff that I did wear with it
already a my my wardrobe because alia is
like my number
inspiration so she always inspires me to
keep it
jazzy but classy you know that type of
things so I still I had brought people
were asking about my outfit the pants
were for my friend the Tommy Hilfiger
belt was also his the tube top I made
that morning the Jackie the time you
figure jacket I brought off her eBay
like two years ago the shoes were my
Jordans although I know she had on white
shoes for the Lea fans who are wondering
like I know you did it down to the tee
but your shoes but the shoes match the
red and my jacket and the whole time
here figure getup so that's why I wore
them instead of worn the white ones and
my hair I wore this wig and this week is
like y'all I'm telling y'all it's like
everything I love this wig and let me
give me no problems it's still holding
up I've washed this wig and everything
and it's still frickin holding up cuz
it's like the best so again I'll put the
link to this wig at the bottom this is
the same wig I've been rocking y'all
from April's lace wigs I'm saying it's
like everything it don't give me no
problems and don't shed and it's yucky
but you know it's still good though um
but I had a good time and didn't think
that really topped it off I think that
was the best thing for me about the
whole dressing up as a leader as being a
fan I love all the Aliyah fans because
when someone passes away they tend to be
forgotten and then you have girls like
Rihanna and Teyana Taylor and a lot of
other girls who pull from her style
every single day which pretty much keeps
her alive but when you have the hardcore
fans like myself and the Ilia fans like
always alia and a Liam Todd in 1979 but
it's so many like I wish I could like
lists all of the fan pages because I
will follow any Alya fan page especially
if you're doing what you're supposed to
do which is repping her sorry oh this is
pissing me off because it was a late um
wait I love all the Aliyah fans and part
of the reason of me doing the costume
was for the fans because I'm one person
that pays attention to detail and when
the detailing them right when somebody's
like doing
it kind of irks me so that's why I
wanted to kind of go down and really do
it up like fully alia Alia um but shout
out to all the girls who did it um I was
the only guy I believe who did a Liam
and then I got the best costume so
that's he'll you boom
she'll live but shout out to start well
cuz he loves this tomorrow you know so I
gotta do the balancing and I shall live
but I got the ultimate like bitch you
did it from the one and only Missy
Elliott and when Missy says you did it
good that means you did it good so now I
feel good and I'm happy and Halloween
was great and you guys are awesome and I
want to say also the last video that I
did work the last video that I posted
was an old video so in the video I do
talk about something that I'm working on
which I am still working on and that
hasn't changed but however I am NOT
doing whiskey girls anymore um whiskey
girls is over some things that happened
with the creators or something happen I
don't know don't get me the lion but
don't give me the telling the truth
either cuz I'm not trying to put nobody
out there however what I will say is it
was a great experience I miss all my
classmates the crew everybody we had a
great time we only did two episodes but
we those two episodes took all day long
and I think one of them was two days if
I'm not mistaken I don't remember but no
I'm not doing whiskey girls from my
understanding the actual franchise did
get a TV deal or something like that but
none of us know well none of our
original actors from it have been
contacted to do anything so I don't
really know what's going on with that
but as far as I'm concerned right now
whiskey girls are not in my future it's
not something that I'm trying to do
because I'm so focused on other things
uh but it was a great run it was fun I
learned a lot and I learned that acting
is something I actually want to do and
you guys have basically told me the very
same thing so I'm excited about that um
what else did I want to talk about what
oh sure um I will be doing some more
hair reviews
some more with reviews and stuff like
that obvious you guys seem to really be
like in those a lot of people were
asking me like can I do some reviews on
like cheaper hair because I know hair is
expensive especially the companies that
I review for some of them get into the
high hundreds um and the answer to that
would be I guess you could say no only
because I don't wear a beauty supply
here not like that like I don't wear
that but that's not something that I
wear and the reason why I don't is
because that hair is not versatile like
this hair is or anything you know saying
like it's not something that I want you
struggle to deal with because beauty
supply here is great out the pack and
then you give it a day you wrap it it's
just not the same it's just not it
doesn't bounce back like these wigs and
your Indian hair and you're proving in
your region hair does it doesn't do that
so that's the kind of only thing that I
don't like um some others some people
were asking me what is my Instagram and
I always put them at the bottom of the
other videos my Instagram or Twitter is
Malibu doll face and I also want to just
address to people I don't have any other
sites but the ones that are listed on
here or my facebook my facebook is mr.
morgendorffer but that's the only thing
that doesn't have Malibu in it but I
don't have nothing else I don't have a
kick I don't have Lois other thing a
vine I don't have I have a kick but I
don't use it and you can see I ain't
uploaded in the longest the best place
you can catch me on his Instagram okay
um yeah if you want me to do reviews and
stuff like that or you have a company
that you want promoted or something like
that always email do not send me a
message on Instagram asking everything
all my booking info is on everything so
that you guys can do it that way because
trying to do business over Instagram I
don't do it cuz I think it's very
unprofessional and it just doesn't work
other than that that's pretty much
everything that's going on with me I got
some things in a work that I'm doing I'm
happy that you guys can see I'm very I'm
blessed
and I think for a long time especially
doing these videos for so long I felt
like I wasn't kind of going anywhere I
didn't really like to do them or not
initially I hated to do them because I
love you guys and I like that if I can
help somebody it makes it worth it but
the passion was gone now it's back and
you know I'm saying I'm happy that I'm
able to kind of share this experience
because for the rest of my life I'm
gonna be able to be like I can look back
on these videos I look like I look at
videos from two years ago like why did I
wear that or why did I do this or why
did I'll do that isn't it's fun it's
like watching home videos but I just
want to let you guys know I'm very
appreciative of all of you guys and this
journey that I'm going it's it's going
great and I hope you guys are having you
know you guys are doing good and I have
a video that I want to talk about not
giving up on your dreams and stuff like
that I'm doing after this one because I
feel like it's important and me I've
been one of those people who stopped and
started and do you know I'm saying like
I want you guys to don't feel like
you're alone you know when it comes down
to certain things so I was not babbling
now which I hope you guys have a great
day and I will talk to you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
