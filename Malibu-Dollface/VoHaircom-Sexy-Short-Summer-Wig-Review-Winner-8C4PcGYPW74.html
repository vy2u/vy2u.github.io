now have you saying this I meet y'all go
because y'all want to see review for
Diaz dude look at that just like are you
okay
so this week that I'm rocking is from a
company called they just called like
veau hair calm that sort of thing I
don't don't quote me now they contacted
me to do her hair review and they told
me to pick any a wig that was on the
site which for any company that's
usually what I do but I did keep that
some of you love a lot of you
we're saying can you do some like short
hairstyle you have the face shape for it
can you do it now a lot of you guys
don't know but when I was in beauty
school my hair was it was longer than
this but it was short it wasn't what it
is now and definitely wasn't was when I
was rocking my braids so I have the head
shape for a short hair style as you can
see I just never do them because they
always make me look like somebody mama
so I never rocked short hair I'm not a
big fan of it but I do like this way
y'all this week whoever cut this they
did a good job like I'm just saying they
did a really good job um it has um I
don't think it's lace it's not really
care if it was cuz you can't see it in
any way I feel like Cece Peniston right
now like finally I hope I'd feel like
every chick from the 90s okay you'll see
if you go to my Instagram you'll see
what I received in wig they sent both of
the wigs in the same arm bag so this one
came in a box just a white box and the
label on it and then in had like this
and the inside to keep the shape of the
wig and then it has this and then it was
wrapped and this and that was it like it
didn't come and it came with the tag
like this is the one for the other wig
but this is it came with this tag with
the information on it and they came with
like this really long black um like
slick
Eve that has the company's name on it
now you guys know with any short wig
like from the front this looks amazing
from the side it looks good but right
here I'll call this the Nene
remember when Derek J was doing that a
27-piece on eating and you when you
watch the show it'll either be stuck to
the back of her neck like this and
claw-like maybe real long or it'll be
coming out so as you can see I can pull
this down in the back if need be um I'm
kind of giving you a little bit of
prince2 but I'm also giving a little bit
of Marcus you doing what you planned you
are a mature fan you know what I'm
talking about so um as you can see often
around it's cut back here can see back
here it's cut like this in the bag which
is it's fine it's not terrible but I
would definitely take this and get some
finish shears and like even it out to
make it look a little more presentable
and usually what happens is when I when
somebody wears a short wig I can always
tell in the back because this is always
a telltale sign but I understand you
can't really if I had like a short
haircut in the back or I had an undercut
this will be perfect cuz I could just
like literally cut in to where the cap
stops and then just kind of let the
smaller pieces like these go down over
my undercut and it would look like I
have a nice taper in the back if you
guys remember the TLC movie that's what
juice adora did she got an undercut
instead of cutting our hair and then
when they would do t-boz his wigs they
would just pretty much put it and then
comb it over in the back sort of look
more natural as if she had that real cut
like t-boz did back in the 90s now I
could also do t-boz haircut if I put two
tracks right here that were black I
could you know be creeping it out um but
I'm not gonna do that
I mean Lee's not right down I'm some
people when I posted this on Instagram a
lot of people loved it there are some
people who hated it sir will can't stand
this wig again like I said before he
called this the unti wig this is the 90s
of heartbreak wig I call this is Anita
the total the Tony and the Nia the
Hallie this all is one way the same cut
everybody had Mary had that one she had
a blonde one though you know t-positive
somebody was like oh you should put some
color in it but I didn't want to put on
color in it
till I did this now maybe later on when
I might get a little Kyla put up in it
but I've always wanted like a pixie cut
or something I was very like short I
just feel like the black Kris Jenner
right now I'm with these little bang
doing what it's doing right now I'm
feeling like Prince Oh like that's how I
feel the good thing about short wigs is
that you don't have to buy a human
heroine you can definitely get a
synthetic one which I believe this one
is but do not quote me because it might
actually be human hair but I don't know
where that little tag is there but it'll
be posted below um so yeah I'll let you
guys know exactly um
how high this has gone home but it was
$20 okay well that's $20 with Free
Shipping I believe so you can't beat
that at all when it comes down to a wig
you guys know I'm getting used to the
whole bang thing so this was working out
a lot for me but this reminds me a lot
of Kris Jenner I'm giving you a
Harriette Winslow um giving you a lot of
people with this I like it now I'm
giving you Keisha from total right now
this was her sneeze right here when I
first tried it on I didn't really like
it too much because it was okay one is
very different for me and two I don't
have any makeup on so not on Apollo pain
own I feel better about it and then once
I put these on with the chain and the
crop top then if I grab this jacket I
look like that girl who got that
horrible song about getting a body I
hope you guys enjoyed this and if you
guys thumbs up this video if you guys
want to see me do more short hairstyles
and if I was to put some color in this
what color would it be but most likely
messing with me he's gonna stay black I
love my mary j blige total my 90s get
down they cut this real good job like
for real like this is real nice for a
nice $20.00 wig okay my sweat man burns
over here over here oh look what just
came back from getting my hairs dead
hey so I hope you guys enjoy my Toni
Braxton here and I was talk to y'all
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
