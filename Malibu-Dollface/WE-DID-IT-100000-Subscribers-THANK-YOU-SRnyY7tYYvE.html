announcement to make
whoa two announcements in one the first
is that it's my birthday
well my birthday was yesterday okay but
I'm gonna celebrate today I really
didn't do much yesterday which was
completely fine by me um but today we're
gonna go like out to Dave &amp;amp; Buster's I
just wanted to do so I wanted to go to
Disneyland but didn't want to go with me
so um yeah I'm gonna do that
and yeah so thank you guys yesterday I
got as I do every year a ridiculous
amount of birthday wishes from Instagram
and Twitter and all of that so in
facebook so thank you guys so much for
that and then my other announcement is I
whoa we have reached over a hundred
thousand subscribers on this channel
egde Italy I have more subscribers than
crashing on sold albums like it's that
serious so I want to say to all of you
guys thank you so much for all of your
hard work telling your friends you told
your cousin's you told your mamma's you
don't show your mama in law's your baby
daddies cuz it's Tracy like everybody
just thank you guys so much for this
milestone and when you get to this point
on my when one or does not match fYI
they send you a plaque it's like a
plaque for reaching 100,000 subscribers
so now I'm gonna get that plaque and
that's like it to me that's like a
YouTube Grammy and although if you get a
million subscribers you get like a
bigger one and it's gold so that
typically will be the Grammy I don't
care but I just know I'm gonna get one
of those so I'm excited about that I
will do a video in an acceptance speech
and all that when I you know um yeah I'm
thankful for all of you guys like I just
wanted to come and say like thank you
cuz I it's so many people to this point
that I can't say thank you to everybody
you don't saying like individually so I
try to do this to try to I see you I see
you know I can read everything but it's
hard to continue to be redundant and be
like
thank you thank you thank you you know
y'all see me I still do try it um but
yeah I think you guys so much fat it
means the world to me that I was able to
go from one channel that was super duper
popular and then start completely over
that channel still by the way but um
just you know and then start a new
channel and then it surpassed my
previous channel and less time than it
took to make that one and get that one
to where it was so this means the world
so again thank you guys so much and then
to top it off I have a giveaway that I'm
about to now in thank you to everybody
who has helped me who has supported me
who's been with me who's been rocking
with me all that good stuff thank you
guys it means the world to me and that's
it that's just pretty much in the paper
right now more videos are coming in more
giveaways bigger giveaways are coming as
well so make sure you stay subscribe
tell a friend and tell a friend and tell
a friend and we have just got started
now our threshold is a million let's do
this okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
