words to people about people on the
internet because you know it's some
foolery going on but if somebody comes
to you and they're very disrespectful to
you about your looks or who you are or
what you do or where you come from
always remember to look at the person
and the source in which this is coming
from because 9 times out of 10 these are
people from backwoods where nobody lives
they have no friends they're mad as hell
because they hug me them damn so you
know people who tend to be not the most
attractive tend to talk about people who
are attractive in a very snotty way like
we did something to them you know I'm
saying or they try to pick you apart and
find little things about you that could
be fixed or we're proved upon but no
they don't want to do that they just
want to pick you apart do not let them
get to you them and everything
that they going through because believe
me trust and believe I don't understand
how you could dislike a person to the
point but know so much about them you
know I'm saying like I don't like you
because you did a video about that I'd
be like bitch I wouldn't give a I
don't give a damn bitch it don't matter
to me you still watching so I got my
view and now you man it is what the hell
it is I feel like that I'm the one of
those people I don't write negative
things are negative on even negative
people but I don't write negative things
on people's comments whether it's videos
Instagram or whatever I just don't feel
this necessary if I have something not
the nicest to say I'll say to myself or
whoever I possibly am with of course
I'll do that but I'm not gonna just say
it to you if you basking in the ambience
of whatever the hell it may be maybe you
just got a new car maybe you just got
some new hair maybe you got some new
lips I don't know but I'm not gonna say
oh boy your hair your weave is busted I
could say that to a lot of people but I
do not say that because that is rude and
it's disrespectful and it's one thing to
be real but it's one thing to be real
rude and you don't want to be that
especially on the internet because
people find a way it could be the most
gorgeous woman the most gorgeous dude
and somebody will find a way to pick out
the negative thing in that beautiful
painting to make themselves feel better
don't let them people get to you because
these people are
they don't leave the house they wear the
same clothes all the goddamn time they
can't afford no hair besides eree
and jazz way they got to stay away from
bitches like that those are not good
people so if you know this person is on
the bus talking about your car you know
the for a fact that they took your shoes
are too expensive because they still
wearing the shoes from when I was in
high school in 1830s don't give these
people nothing just go on about your day
because they thinking about you and the
fact that you thinking about you is
enough they're keep thinking about me
but keep talking about me bitch I am
that bitch that you wanna be that's why
you keep discussing me and on that note
stay fabulous the haters because
they mad as don't give me no fuel
cuz they can't go on a weird thing I
don't who you know I'm saying your card
ain't Kane tribe hang out I'm not going
on guys
so there you go let it be what it is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
