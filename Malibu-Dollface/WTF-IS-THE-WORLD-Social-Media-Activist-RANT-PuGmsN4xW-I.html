video because social media you know a
couple of missions going you like that
alright so you guys know the situation
that's going on with the whole black
lives matter and all of these black men
are being murdered at a alarming rate
and because of social media everybody
has an opinion um me personally when I
hear things like this
it's just disheartening back in like to
EE feet past in like 2012 my friend and
tomorrow Robertson was murdered by the
NYPD for doing absolutely nothing so the
the situation at hand is very is
something that resonates with me and
it's very close he was a very good
friend of mine he was killed
mercifully for something that he didn't
do you know I'm saying he didn't do
anything so a lot of times when
tragedies like this happen I usually
don't say anything and the reason why I
don't say anything because it's
something very close to me
and it makes me emotional I don't like
to go on a tangent about how I feel
because usually how I feel is not the
greatest and from a person who's been
through a whole lot in my life I've
learned to look at the better things in
life and try to steer away from the
negative now I feel like with
social media because everybody has an
opinion because I am black I people feel
like I should be enraged and I should be
out here disrespecting other cultures
and I should do anything that is going
to give way and give reason to a
behavior that is not to be respected and
when all is said and done people are
people and the fact that these men were
murdered a man was trying to sell CDs
and was murdered for it
Trayvon Martin was minding his business
and was murdered for it
Sandra bland was pulled over for
something that was not even an issue and
was murdered for it
so when there are situations like this
and they become very just ridiculous
it's it's very sad and it's
disheartening but for my child who lived
in a hood these are things that I've
seen
on a regular basis and these are things
that have been come very normal to me so
I don't really react as if it's new
because to me it isn't new and I'm not
saying that it's right but because I
choose to find the better part of the
day versus the negative part of the day
or me or anybody else I think it's very
sad that there are Crusader people who
are just want everybody to be just as
angry as they are a lot of these people
that are on social media will know
nothing about this and speaking nothing
of this in about a week there are a lot
of people right now who really don't
give a about what's happening they
just want to be part of the conversation
because it's a trending topic now the
thing that really gets on my nerves is
that everybody wants to use the fact
that people who have a lot of
subscribers of a lot of followers should
use their platform to spread awareness
it is all over the internet there is
nothing that I post on my page would do
to let you know what's going on that you
don't already know if I don't choose to
say anything that is my business if I
choose to mind my business
that is my business if I choose to not
be a follower and be upset because
everybody else is upset that is my
business
what you're not gonna do is tries to sit
up there and try to wrap pitchforks for
a person who said nothing wrong did
nothing wrong now if I was a
disrespectful ass bitch I could have
said a lot but I've learned as an adult
everything that I feel doesn't always
need to be said
I have people and subscribers all over
the world from different genres from
black to white to life gained from
everywhere every that I
could think of in the world supports me
and what I do the last thing I want to
ever do is disrespect somebody period
the last thing I want to ever do and I'm
not saying if I speak on the said topic
that I would be disrespecting somebody
if I was in favor of the victims I'm not
saying that but it also what kills me is
that a lot of people don't understand my
struggle they don't understand that the
things that you guys are upset about
right now I go through everyday not only
am i black I'm gay and the fact that I'm
gay in America most of them
 Brent that I get comes from my
very own community okay
so understand that when certain
situations happen it's very hard for me
to say I'm undecided I'm on that side
and as an adult I don't feel like I
should have to pick a side
period there is no side because at the
end of the day me picking the side or me
being mad at this person or that person
doesn't bring the people that are gone
back that's the problem a lot of you
just want to sit back and be part of
something because again it's on social
media we could go down there's countless
amount of names of people that you hear
know after about a week nobody cares
then what kills me is that you guys want
to say well you guys have a platform you
should use it my platform is no
different from yours it may be a little
bit bigger but it doesn't mean that you
don't have one so don't try to tell me
because what I've worked hard for I now
have to use because what you feel what
you think I should do what I do and how
I run is how I am going to do it I felt
very bad about every situation that has
happened and all the victims that have
been victimized all the families to see
that man's son cried because his father
is no longer there it's very
heartbreaking to me okay but understand
every five minutes I'm not about to
retreat some every
six minutes I'm not about to be on
Facebook getting a
attitude because you want me to be mad
I'm not doing that I still have to live
my life and go forward so if you want
somebody to be mad because you
 upset
you shouldn't have no way to even be
part of social media that's why it like
this needs to be monitored because you
have people with one-sided ass opinions
speaking for group of people that should
happen to be part of because of your
skin color so there for us as black
people know know us as black people need
to stick together and learn how to be
respectful to everybody I give the
utmost respect to the game and Snoop
Dogg because they did this they decided
we're not gonna say the police
because all police officers are not bad
so the fact that people
out here killing police officers on top
of the fact that all of these men were
murdered and you're making any other
innocent people pay for what other bad
people did you're no better than the
people who are doing it to the people in
the black community you're it's a circle
and with a lot of things that I don't
understand is that you want to talk
about the oppressor and the man who got
a foot on your neck don't you understand
that if you do these things you're doing
exactly what they want you to do if
you're out here hurting other people
just like they did your own people now
they have more of a reason to shoot you
I'm not saying that I have all the
answers to how things are gonna work and
how things should be handled but I'm
gonna tell you what it is if you keep it
up the way things are going things are
going to get way worse and then it kills
me
because a lot of these young kids are
sitting here watching this and thinking
that the behavior that their parents are
doing is okay so for me as a person to
sit back and have strangers that I don't
know have an opinion on me not saying
anything wrong but for me to just mind
my own business it's baffling to
me but what I'm not gonna do is I'm not
gonna take it the next bitch that say
something that I don't
like I'm letting off in your
 ass and i'ma personally
hurt so feelings because
in a time where you should be trying to
come together as a community you're so
worried about who's not doing what
you're not doing anything the time you
take to tweet about why Kim Kardashian
just said something takes away time from
you trying to help out your own
community you're so worried about the
next
you are not doing your job and that
right there is the problem so my thing
that I do not understand is why the
 I always say this about people
who want to be role models and like
this and you want to give the superstar
in the celebrity and the celebrity time
and
socialite the due
diligence and the
authority to raise your kids stop
looking for Rihanna to be a
 example for your daughter
she's your child Rihanna ain't got no
kids so Kim Kardashian has two children
and so they happen to be partly black so
rather she decided to speak and period
or never should not concern you about
your crusade to help out your people
stop allowing other to be
your voice a lot of you
are saying to celebrities that she
should say something and why aren't you
speaking why isn't this person speaking
y'all don't understand in about a week
when you're over this these people still
have to go to work so if you're at your
job and somebody is being disrespected
and you stand with them there's a big
chance that you're gonna lose your
employment which basically house your
family you and yourself and it's
up that it's that way but if somebody's
not speaking it's probably not because
they don't want to and I'm not speaking
for myself because I already told you my
reasons but a lot of times these people
don't have a choice okay so if you're
not gonna give this person the
opportunity to make money with you
when they quit they get fired from a job
then what are you gonna do you're
requesting a lot but you're not giving
anything stop allowing other people to
be your reason as to why you do
something if you wanna stand for a
 cost and you get the
up
whether you stand up alone in your voice
shakes our you stand with
a group make sure that what you're
saying and how you feel or how you feel
not everybody else how the you feel
so for me to be respectful to not only
people who have been through this so
many years this is not new for so many
years people have been through this very
same thing a lot of times with you what
you don't say is probably the best thing
that you could do because how I feel a
lot of times the situations on where I
be a lot of times it's not the nicest so
I don't want to say something that I'm
gonna regret because I wouldn't want
nobody to do this to me
so somebody
made a comment it was a young man who
made a comment he since apologized
because I was not his um his point and I
accept your apology
but what you're not gonna do is you're
not gonna try to parent me about how I
should act as an adult okay because
there's a lot of people out here acting
just like the monkeys they call you so
I'm not about to do that okay that's
what I'm not gonna do so understand when
all is said and done it's not about I
only support gay rights because if that
was the case I would've did a video
about Orlando but I haven't done a video
about Orlando I didn't do one about any
of the things that have been going on
because the point of my channel for you
guys is to have an outlet to be excited
and have fun and laugh and enjoy not if
the world is the precedent of social
media right now is the one I just wish
the internet would break because not
because of the message that's being
Simba because of the way a lot of the
people are handling the message and
they're carrying the message because
there's a lot of monkey-see and
monkey-do going on and a lot of people
are not thinking about our actions and
our consequences for things that they're
doing now that will possibly affect them
later and not just you but the community
that you represent so I get the
frustration I get being mad you know
there's a lot of things that I don't
talk about on this channel that I
personally been through because of the
fact that I'm gay and I'm black but you
know what when all is said and done a
lot of things that I do go through I
take for what it is for me because
everything that I feel does not need to
be said everything that I've been
through doesn't need to be explained and
that's what you gotta
understand that got so much
 opinion about people who
don't even know you
so i'ma leave it there imma let it be
what it is I hope everybody's having a
great day I pray for the victims the
officers that were unmercifully
killed and the countless amounts of
black people that have been killed the
gay people the Latino everybody I pray
for those people because those are the
victims and I feel like a lot of times
when situations happen like this
youtubers Instagram personalities they
use these
hashtags to make the money okay so I'm
not gonna hashtag this video anything
that has to do with anything that's
going on I will not monetize this video
or anything because I just want you guys
to hear my message and my message is
learn to respect everybody learn to
respect your fellow neighbor and also
respect the neighbor down the street
because at the end of the day you never
know who you're going to need in a time
of crisis or happiness so learn to
respect the world because at the end of
the day we all bleed the same understand
that and I get it some of us are being
very very very much targeted and it's
not okay but it's also not okay to fight
violence with violence against people
who didn't deserve it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
