quick my updates come to my ipod I'm

anywhere um and the Sun is going down so
and it was so hot today it was hotter
than the jalapenos coochie today now all
of a sudden son I'm gonna go down when I
wanna do a video or whatever okay before
I get started I want to give a shout out

things today it's somebody else birthday

don't like him um but I do know his

shout out to my girl Salim in 77 for

since mean by her m from our side which
is video on blast 101.com and if you
want to purchase similar items then you
can go there and use doll face as your
checkout and you'll get ten percent off
of your entire order so hit it up and I
know the little clones I know y'all are
y'all gonna be over there behind exactly
what I got on but it is ok that is cute
for you so anyway today is what is a
role model / idle like what is that what
would it you know people hit me up a lot
and saying you know you're my role model
you're my idol you're you know such
situation and I don't never know how to
reply to that and it's always weird to
me because I'm just I'm just a boy from
LA you know what a dream and a camera
that's about it you know I don't really
have no big um no big type situation you
know I'm not famous I'm not
celebrity type situation and the more
people that you usually idolize type
situation and that's fine there's
nothing wrong with that but my issue
with that particular arm that particular
saying is this people and when I say
people i mean some older people some
young to UM tend to say you shouldn't be
idolizing lo Kim of jay-z of Britney
Spears lindsay lohan you should be
idolizing dr. Martin Luther King and
madam CJ walker and Rosa Parks because
they murder people you know and it was
all due respect I respect those people
but you guys also have to understand too
we don't have no we can't relate to that
that was so long before us and that
really is not something that most young
adults we even want to you know talk
about now don't get me wrong there are
young adults who look up to Barack Obama
and some girls who look up to Michelle
Obama you know in people of that stature
you know but not all young people are
like that they don't make music they
don't have nothing that really moves us
as of young individuals you know you you
Gravitt or you graduate you gravitate
towards things that you can identify
with just because you are
african-american that doesn't mean that
Rosa Parks is gonna be your idol you
know what she did because that's a you
know that's a curriculum in school you
have to learn about uh you know
african-american history but and that's
another thing to you don't want to talk
about nothing that you aren't in school
not this is not everybody okay like I
said it's not everybody so if you don't
feel this way then shut up but I'm just
talking in general you know we ask
people we like who we like we respect to
e respect but you can't tell me or
anybody else who I can and can't like
because you feel that they're not worthy
or they haven't did anything um worth uh
gawking over are going gaga over but you
never know people's walks of life maybe
I can't identify with Barack Obama but I
can identify with Drake or maybe I can't
identify
with um dr. Martin Luther King but I can
identify with jay-z maybe that's the
difference you know I don't really
identify with Rosa Parks but I love Lil
Kim's mouth you know maybe that's the
difference you know because it is how
you grew up so if you love somebody and
somebody's telling you you shouldn't
because they haven't contributed nothing
to the community that's bullshit because
what works for them doesn't work for you
and works for you doesn't work for them
so maybe these people have done
something for you in music say something
to you on Twitter maybe they have really
helped you to your life you know so when
people do tell me that you know I take
it and I do say thank you because that's
an honor to be called someone's Idol or
things of that nature you know what I do
see a lot of people who are inspired by
the things that I do and say where and
all it is a good stuff and that's fun
for you if you want to copy me fine go
ahead I don't care just we know you got
it from so whatever but um you know I
don't feel like it's fair for older
generations and some you know newer
generations should look down on these
kids um based on who they like you know
you can't say why you don't like Rosa
Parks but then you buy every nicki minaj
CD that comes out for your daughter
that's your fault because you are you
hello like that's your parent like bebes
act like one you can't expect for your
child to do one thing when you're doing
another that's when things that don't
complain about it and then I hear people
like Steve Harvey talking about he's on
the fucking news and shit crying talking
about our african-american men already
shut the fuck up would show stupid ass
he always talked you know and that's
another thing to let me just speak on
that he always got something to say
about somebody else situation he can
even keep his damn marriage together
like shut the fuck you don't have an
opinion about nothing wrote a
relationship book though nerve the
fucking nerve just like me writing a
book talking about how to be Mexican
what do I know about that
what do what do what I possibly tell you
that makes no sense you know so you
can't even make you a relationship work
then you shouldn't be writing books
about it cuz you know nothing about it
but back to the subject at hand you know
um and just itches I don't feel like
it's fair especially to our youth if you
have a daughter who's obsessed with
Miley Cyrus or lindsay lohan and the
wild things that they do then you sit
down as a parent and you ask them why do
you love Lindsay she's out here getting
drunk and things of that nature but
understand this it's the society that
we're in and think things that Lindsay
Lohan do is what girls want to become
they want to become tabloid darlings you
know but if you can still in your
daughter well maybe Lindsay is not the
person that you should want to pattern
yourself as or look up to how about
Jennifer Lopez you know she has a
successful music career movie career
she's a mother she's a positive
influence and she's the overall woman
you know Lindsay Lohan is still trying
to get there and she's fell into some
things in her life that didn't quite
work out perfect example of this is
Paris Hilton a lot of people I mean like
my family just didn't get my obsession
with pears when when she first came out
and I knew about the Hilton sisters like
way before Paris even got the simple
life because they were in magazines and
I remember they had an e true Hollywood
story and that's how I found out about
him but Paris is probably like 19 at the
time when I came out in paris is like
1030 so it's been you know a while since
you know ouch um a team here we go again
that same person but um you know as I
got to know who she was as a person not
Paris Hilton the reality star but Paris
Hilton the daughter the sister you know
I was like wow she's actually cool like
you know she's a cool individual and
then you look she did everything she
really set the tone for a lot of these
bitches like kim kardashian and lindsay
lohan and heidi montag to go out there
and show them she used her celeb reality
um Steve as you could say um such as we
do on YouTube and think said that she
used that to parlay that into a career
because at first she didn't do anything
now she's Paris Hilton she has her own
perfume she has her own I thought I
heard something she has our own album
she has her own line of clothes she has
an on line of shoes she has her own
Empire she built something you know you
know you look at lindsay lohan Lindsay's
done thing she's a great actress you
know she's not a she's not a bad singer
at all but it's her personal life is
what's fucking her all up right now but
that's me that's beside the point um but
yeah I just think that we need to just
learn that an idol a role model all of
that shit is issues is based on the
person that's just bottom line it's
based on the person so if your child is
obsessed with judge Justin Bieber and he
wants to be just like Justin he is not
gay um he probably admires something
that Justin does and he wants to be a
singer he wants to be a rapper he wants
to be an entertainment you know things
of that nature so just don't don't take
it that far you know and don't bring up
the past you need to be more like dr.
Martin Luther King okay and we have in
common that were african-american black
men I'm not understanding the
correlation here I'm an understanding
that I respect him but I don't want to
be just like him I don't want to be that
you know I would just want to be a
strong individual you know so it is what
it is but I just I will say this as well
as the african-american black gay men
will multicultural mix whatever you want
to call me I don't care um I have to say
there are not a lot of people in this
world that I can identify with I
identify with women more than I've I
identify with men I call myself a Tom
girl because I love things that are
girly but I also love my fitted hats and
you know my jeans and my tennis shoes
and things of that nature you know
and that's not the norm and some people
say that we as men or less of men
because we do talk or appear to be not
what you guys expect but what the fuck
is normal and when my why am i hiding or
trying to be something that just isn't
me that's the problem now just
understand that people like me people
like a just lesbian women men we're not
new this is not new this is not like a
new breed this has been around for a
long time the only difference is we are
allowing ourselves to be who we are
regardless of with other people have to
say that's the only difference so
understand when you say things like that
you need to be a strong black man I'm
stronger than most men out here with 10
kids four baby mamas and no job so
understanding okay that doesn't make you
any if anybody is listening to me this
doesn't make you any less of a man due
to the simple fact that you love who you
love and you do what you do that's your
business you know so you don't have to
look up to a Barack Obama and Michelle
Obama and all of these other people
because people say you have to if that's
what you choose to like and they inspire
you then by all means that they don't
think you don't have to that's just
bottom line so don't go through life
doing shit that you don't want to do
because people are other people are
telling you to do it it it's your life
live it to the fullest and live it like
you want to and if anybody has any other
problems with that that's their personal
shit so fuck them and everything are
they going through that's how I look at
it ok well um that mother can hurt um
I'm gonna go my back hard shot I've been
sitting in the same spot for like 30
minutes probably longer I'm ready to go
I'll talk to y'all next week ok</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
