kind of the reason why I did this I am a
person with a lot of okay I have a
lot clothes a lot of shoes I love
fashion
but the problem was I had too much stuff
that was starting to cost me a little
bit too much and then I had it stuffed
in a little air quality so originally
this was going to be a studio for what
I'm doing right now and actually shoot
right now and like my dining room area
and then I was like why would you do
that when your clothes literally are
throwing up in your bedroom closet won't
you just make a walk-in closet
so that was my whole point of doing this
it wasn't necessarily saying oh look
what I have or turn of bowls or anything
like that because looking at the closet
that I have now and what you guys you
know have seen stuff like that is that I
never having nothing you know and I
worked very hard hard to get to this
position and I it's good to just kind of
see it makes me I just sit sometimes
like wow I've come a long way so that's
really what the reason for me was to do
this in the kind of show people
organization goes a long way because
another issue that I kept having was I
had opportunity to keep things in their
original casings such as shoes and boxes
makeup in bags and stuff like that so
what happens is I start to have all of
these clothes from forever 21 and skeino
and they stay in their bag and I never
can find them so when you can't find
anything you can't wear the so
that's what I would buy multiples of
this I got like literally like at least
25 pairs of black pants because I kept
buying I'm thinking I don't have
anything I finally just went to my
closet so this was another way for me to
organize all of this that I have
rather be jewelry rings whatever and
actually put it in one face
yeah okay so I guess we'll start from
here so this can all make sense to you
guys
so I'll start here because this will
make this was the inspiration for my
entire closet this is my Barbie's closet
for my Barbie doll and I wanted to do a
closet that would represent and bargain
how the closet and she lives in a
two-bedroom apartment oh it would be so
that's pretty much what this is all go
over every freaking thing that you guys
are seeing right now one by one so let's
start here do this so this a these
lights are from Ikea so I'll put one
here and one there I was going to put
them at the top but I've decided not to
because there is so much lighting going
on here I didn't want to just it to be
so bright in here I wanted some contrast
of some sort so these photos that you
are seeing on the wall are actually
illustrations by rober best and rubber
best actually is the illustrator for
Mattel and most most iconic Lee Barbie
these are from the 2015 mosquito Barbie
collection and I decided to I had the
pen slit from like the I guess you could
program from that show so I scanned all
these and have them blown up so that I
could have them on my wall actually have
like I think two more but I haven't
picked them up this particular outfit is
actually I'm set outfit and roll okay so
we'll start from I guess back here so
these are just I decided to just hit but
usually when I'm doing stuff you guys
follow his Instagram page
you guys know I do like a lot of
different looks so this is usually where
else to keep things thought I have two
of these this is the clean one you guys
don't have this jacket in real life so
this B is actually looks like $2 from
Ikea and I just got this book enough too
long ago but it's actually Barbies like
straight to the mosquito face Wow
but it's really a it's a look and a
diary of like all the photography that
they do for Barbie on her Barbie style
Instagram page and I am actually working
on a coffee table book for like
literally driving that they were doing
this I wanted to do this with my own
doll so this is like a big inspiration
for me and this came out I think the
first of this month so I haven't had it
that long but I've been through every
page consistently and whenever I feel a
little clouded or just want to try
something new I go to that if you love
me you should know that this is my
favorite candle in the freaking world
these smells so freakin amazing
I keep them on hand i buy them by the
dozens from TJ Maxx and Marshalls and
Ross this is just a last that I got from
Ikea and I went ahead and just put on
the wall myself I'm actually going to
put one there as well and I have some
smaller ones I'm going to put in my
bedroom so these are the pops that I got
you guys know things are extremely
popular but I want to do because this is
from the new Power Rangers movie and
this is from the old tile Rangers and
actually have the reverse somewhere in
my apartment so these are um fragrances
that I use often so that we have to
fantasy by britney instead of celebrity
I'll be on seven ear
these are Gaga and this is my one of my
favorites ever which is re by Ariana
Grande this is Gucci floor which is
another favorite I love this dish it
smells of freakin amazing
so then thank you to all of you
wonderful Oh who helped me get my over a
hundred thousand which is crazy because
almost at five hundred thousand L and
when I get my million plaque I
definitely plan to put it right smack
dab in the middle busy but just gonna
have to get moved um so here is my
Christian Louboutin and nail polish
which I never use so this is the first
one I had ever purchased when I had them
at the Sephora as you can see it's like
separating because I never use it at the
one these are like 55 dollars of
girl bein no different than OPI but um I
got them from Sephora the one in Santa
Monica and then this is the one that
came with like extra ones like darling
and separating so that and this one
actually goes here and yeah but they're
really good for decoration and I love
all of the colors of course and then we
have my little Kim diamond queen bee
watch which I never wear like I should
but every so often I'll wear this watch
but it's very sentimental to me and it's
upside down so but yeah she did these
like I think I'm like mm like right run
and I could true so like mm I want to
say like five or six and I wear this
every so often you'll catch it in my
videos but I wanted to put it out
because it's been locked up like a
Cinderella in a dungeon then we have my
printer this is my mosquito Barbie these
are the ones that just came out I
already did a review on those I just got
these today which is my Saint in center
fragrances by Kat Von D guess which one
I like the most my macbook this is my
iMac and I use this one to do like a lot
of heavy editing I did like all of my
like shorts on here I'm gonna have to do
like music stuff or audio stuff I'll do
it on here this little lamp here which i
think is extremely cute and I think it's
actually plugged up okay so since I'm
 sure that we don't just lay
there with it I never really used it but
I've used it a couple of times but not
as often because again it is hella
bright in here
this little Locker thing I got from Ikea
as well which I really like it's a lot
of junk in there so we're not going to
open that this desk got it from Ikea and
I took some arm contact paper and just
put some marble on the top of this just
because I didn't want it to just be like
waitand waitand waitand waitand like I
wanted to select add some type of
contrast in here so it makes sense you
know so then we have this carpet which
is actually from Target and I just
wanted something that was white and
plush and clean and nice that I could
just
walk on that kind of complimented
everything in here so this chair is
actually a four I think these in a
Barbie something and I really wanted
them and actually have these for the
Barbie doll to so model actually has
this as well and this blanket is
actually I don't know what collection on
what Louboutin collection this was an
but I remember seeing it and it was a
girl and she had it on like a dress and
I had to have it but it's very
comfortable
Goldie loves this this is her Jewish
when she comes over she grabs his book
and yes she gets comfortable but it's
functional and fashionable so these are
my these are my traveling luggage like
whenever I go somewhere I usually take
you know do this because it's I know for
a fact that I'm not gonna have black
luggage on the conveyor belt I know for
a fact the black mines this is
obviously my mask you know it's like a
trench coat with these big you know
Barbies buttons are always bigger than
the face which I love I got this mirror
from Target and you know target I got
these curtains from Target as well I
haven't seen them so excuse the wrinkles
down here but I haven't seen them
moonchild and then this rod I got from
Ikea is what which I think was like $7
so I'll start what we're going to go
back here this well this is four coats
and stuff like this is my rain jacket I
had to do this for some chunky stuff the
other day that's why I got all on
it and then you guys know I love to wear
these windbreakers because they're very
comfortable
so as my Barbie loves Mack poster which
I think I'm going to put like in my
entrance so big question I get often
whether you store where do you store
your wigs well this is ladies and
gentlemen how I store my goddamn wig
every last one of those bins are still
to the tip with wigs
that's a row right here and that's my
eye on hoodie dryer that's some stuff
for my background
the box for Chucky this is my Alexander
McQueen glasses and these this back type
is actually my Buscemi backpack that
goes with those pink puppies there in
the back so since we're here we're going
to start on the sides of shoes shoes
those are my Freddy flats slick and I
love your closer look at the sole guys
this is why I hate by Louboutin
look at that oh so those are my three
slides these are some Giuseppe's um
these are my Jeremy Scott bears these
are some more cheese at these um some
bears these are all my Gucci Coda's I
believe these are Gucci Coda's these are
some more giuseppe's these are some
giuseppe's these things those are Martin
Margiela back there these are some loose
key know these look you know shoes
actually go with which you can't see
this is damn light but it goes with does
Looney tune stuff so we're going to go
this way and i'ma start up here so that
is I'm gonna try to get a close-up long
as I can but that duffel bag is my
Looney tune that has Latino all over it
like I said that goes with this and it
also matches these shoes and then that's
my Barbie duffel bag remember I had that
video where I said I hate eBay and I
couldn't find the dogs of our beautiful
Baraga I did it and I was really pissed
off about it
well I have one two and three of them
bitches now look at God okay so this um
this is my mosquito bear a duffel bag
this backpack is look how big it is
compared to my hand it is from the
Barbie collection as well and I also
have the turban to match it that's
another Barbie duffel bag that is a doll
Louboutin carrier I only use it carrier
when I know for a fact that they are
going to be out with me and I can't have
them out because it's so small and
kind of fidgety around people I'll bring
you but other than that it stays in here
I don't know what the hell it is and
that is a joy which bag is a duffle bag
as well so here I have my laundry of
just dirty that I need to wash but
I just still have it so we're going to
go back to shoes these are some adidas
these are some Nikes I think those are
dissipates back there yeah these are my
McDonald heels from like that I feel
like the fries look like a fried
container I wore these for Halloween
last year so this is my my heels for my
McDonald's makino Alfie these are my Toy
Story which I still have not word none
of these are giuseppe's on the inside I
wear these for New Year's one year and
then these two are from the Balmain H&amp;amp;M
collection down here are my pink Makino
or western boots which actually my dog
has the same exact boot so cute right
those boots those boots in the back are
actually going to not say that we have
color they're going to be they're about
to be spray-painted a certain color and
these are my what I call these the so
caddy these are my so Kade I guess it's
okay to use like the little shoe tip
brands so let's go to close so these all
of this stuff is just that I don't wear
on a regular basis so again here is
another loony-tunes Makino situation I
wore this to the maquis mosquito fashion
show I wear these also in my videos this
is the jacket that model has this terry
cloth jacket here is this I wore this in
my Barbie review this
this jacket is actually it has on the
hood of it has um a teddy bear on it and
it matches that purse which I'll get to
in a second and then all the lights that
you see that's in here all these lights
are on they run on batteries so
therefore I can turn them on or I can
turn them off and I can dim them all to
a certain if I want to turn them off
that's at all if I want to turn them off
like I want to then I have the ability
to do so if I want to turn them back on
all at once and I can use one remote for
all of these lights except these are all
for the lights that have shoes and
purses in them all these lights are
actually plugged into the wall so I'll
go to these clothes now so I have a
couple hangers up there that I haven't
turned out well what I'm going to do
with them all of this stuff don't feel
cheap so don't think Kimberly was so
efficient but all of this deputy said
that I pulled out my closet so if you
notice that these hangers are not the
same as all of these like all these are
uniformed
these are hangers that I've haven't like
changed out left but it's still up there
I haven't really got to that yet because
I didn't think it was that important so
this is just stuff that I've worked at
in past years like I think these are my
Alexander Wang scuba top that you guys
see me in many of times this is my ideas
which I love I haven't worked a number
on how long this is my JLo jacket yeah
by j.lo shape um this is my german scott
jacket i remember wearing this jacket
with that synthetic wig that tingle like
crazy yeah I wore a lot of this stuff
that you guys seen most iconically you
guys remember me for my R&amp;amp;B jacket and
just a lot of this stuff that you guys
have seen me in my chunky one piece and
then down here I have pair earrings in
here for if I'm doing a specific look
and I need some
Oh some belts and then and here is just
a whole bunch of old Barbie stuff that I
have these colors just make me so
excited okay so we're going to go to
these back now so the bags are all in
this particular if you didn't notice
that this keys this one in the middle is
shorter than those and it's because the
base board over here I didn't measure
which goes around the entire room it was
literally like a half of a centimeter
where it wouldn't fit so I remember when
I really did the video there was a big
it was one of these that was sitting
right here that one is now behind my
back drop so I had to buy this one in
order to survive because I didn't want
this to be separate I didn't want it to
be like this is nothing this is I didn't
it just bothered me so I brought this
and because that backpack had nowhere to
go
it actually fits so when you come in it
feels like this all goes together
because those things are at the top you
got to make it work folks so I'll open
this and this is a door that does not
come with this you have to buy these
separately so this is one of my favorite
bags ever which is my mosquito hangar
purse which you see miss thing over
there has in her hand so you can wear it
the way that she has or you can actually
wear it with a strap so it has a strap
to it in our word surprise this year and
again these are all battery-operated
lights so I can use that remote or I can
turn them off myself if I needed to this
is my mosquito pink bag which is from
the Barbie collection this is the bear
jacket that I mean bear purse that goes
with that bear collection and this
jacket here and then one of my favorite
bags ever which is my pink Barbie purse
that's inflatable and it's very light
but it makes a lot of noise I love this
bag so that I want the other one that
doesn't have a zipper this is the also
came from the Barbie collection with the
hills that I haven't worked as ahead I
found anything but these things are so
bright in the Sun like these are real
frosty crystals
a little scared and then I have my
mcdonald purse which goes with those
fuels i showed you earlier
so now we're going to go to jewelry
which is i seem to be a lot of you guys
favorite part when i initially like
preview this so we're going to pull this
out now just to be clear all of the
stuff that you're seeing as far as disco
this these inserts be shelving this all
the stuff these lights they all came
from ikea i didn't go anywhere else
everything like 99.9% of stuff in here
came from ikea so jewelry wise so a lot
of these like these big belts right here
these are not change these are both are
from Massino so this is from the bear
collection which at the end of it has
like a credit card on it and this is
also it this spells out machine Oh which
I wore to Coachella the year before last
these are some earrings that I keep here
a couple of rings these are some ski no
cuffs that are really I just got these
much too long ago and I really like
these are some you know bear earrings
that I have these were Barbie came with
these so I had to get though these even
though these clip-ons heard these are
the another pair of their earrings I got
these from forever 21 which I love here
are a couple of chains that have like
this one has my name on it
that I got for I think Christmas this
one says damage I got a from Hot Topic
and I like to layer these my favorite
watch ever which is my eye style all
gold g-shock which is the wrong as time
I work for more fashion than I actually
wear for I got a phone for the time my
gold chain and then these are some
actual other gold chains that I have
that if I want to like layer something I
just want to get stupid and look so
ridiculous I can these are my McDonald
earrings that I spray-painted myself
that day of Halloween last year for my
McDonald's outfit
more and I'll link the seller below
they're very hollow but I really like
these I can wear SEC jewelry so it works
there's a couple more these are this is
a Cartier bracelet that I got as a gift
hair art I got these from guess I
haven't worthy those of you but they're
like slinkys in a way where you can just
pull these apart and then you can run
them up your wrist and then I love the
hell out of these I love these two Duff
and I got all of these in this section
from guest:this I didn't read it from
scream queens
it has blood all on it and I actually
got it out and I was able to keep
because I was going to throw it away but
I got it from forever 21 I think I work
up ladies and scream queens as well and
I was able to salvage these and keep
them I think these in the back these two
were from the Steve Aoki video and loved
them they just hurt put them on and off
this is my hour communicator my Power
Rangers communicator this is my smoothie
chain that I get the most questions
about this was actually made by a
company called jewelry fresh and they
made actually all of these for me look
how big this is
this is ridiculous and I haven't I have
some stuff coming up with this it's just
the Barbie official this one is all
white this one is pink I think I think
one of these are pink and learn these
are white but it's very faint and then I
have actually this one so yeah jewelry
fresh if you need something custom that
you've drew up or you just want a logo
or something they are the perfect people
for that super cool people there in San
Francisco interested hit them up my
grill a couple of earrings here so like
I said this all this stuff came from
Ikea very easy to put together so we
have this which it sounds like a Maj
part of a mess so these are all the
earrings I mean all the sunglasses and
stuff that I have so when I'm looking
for something because yeah it was it
became a mess where I couldn't find any
of this stuff it was all in bags and
drawers and it just didn't work like
this as a chain it goes around my built
for my McDonald's purse down there
here's a couple of you know some more
just clear glasses I have some extra
earrings from forever 21 these are some
of you know headbands that came from the
Barbie collection that you guys have
seen in I got a couple of dust bags in
here I got me some Hot Topic coupons
girl cuz I live for the sale though I
never ever actually some sunglasses that
I have to like the summertime a brush I
clearly have use this is my mosquito
phone case which is the right size with
this broke-ass phone in it but it's a
great prop because actually I'm working
on something that's going to need some
pop my site top success so these are
drawers down here are really just
drawers of just meant Alania stuff that
I've washed there's some t-shirts down
there and some bar being there and if
that's really what this is ins housing
they're just random I haven't really put
everything of what it is going to be in
here in there because I just know
whatever um and so yeah that's pretty
much it guys if you guys have any
questions let me know like I said I
didn't spend too much I think the month
I spent on this closet about two
thousand dollars but compared to what I
would have been charged to do this and
has somebody else doing it with the
lighting and everything it would be well
over that so I'm happy you guys enjoyed
it I'm happy I was able to do this
finally I'd like a safe haven I didn't
get around to wolves I got around a
binding but it ain't here but I had like
a bench that's going to go right here
after the carpet guy comes because the
back-and-forth has ruined my damn carpet
but once he come is going to be a bench
test it's right here so when I come in
here and I actually want to sit down I
can look and see what I want because a
lot of this stuff I don't wear every
single day like I don't look like Tony
to tiger every day so I don't want to
have this in my bedroom because it just
doesn't make any sense so I want to
separate the glam stuff and then the
regular stuff so this was kind of
lengthy but I hope that this has helped
if you guys have any questions about
anything in here feel free to leave the
comments below and I'll do my best to
reply to all of those and I will catch
you guys in my next one so I hope you
guys enjoyed it and you guys have any
questions about this particular tour I
will link every single item below that I
use such as the structures the drawers
the light everything will be listed
below for those who are wanting to do
this are you just a little curious about
the price point I believe that my entire
closet cost me somewhere around $2,500
which is not a lot because you got
remember I looked at la closet to do
this and they quoted me a price out than
seven hundred and something dollars and
that wasn't including the lights or any
of the drawers it was literally just
like to put the up so IKEA is very
inexpensive and if you do it right it
will last you as long as it can but also
I did it myself
because I wanted to be able to say I did
it it was my closet so I wanted to do it
but I also wanted to save money because
IKEA has it where it today they base it
on how much you buy if you buy three
thousand dollars worth of stuff then
you're going to be quite a holder the
price of almost a thousand dollars to
have them come and actually put it up
for you so I'm like I can keep that
money and actually buy more stuff for my
closet as opposed to just paying
somebody else to do while I sit there
and drink lemonade in the shade like I'm
not that gay as far as not wanting to do
nothing I get my hands dirty I put all
my stuff together so I can actually get
the length no much missing guy
a little time in a little effort I think
all together is took me about a month to
do every single thing and get everything
where I wanted it so I hope you guys
enjoyed this again if you have any
questions please put them below and I'll
get you guys a minute</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
