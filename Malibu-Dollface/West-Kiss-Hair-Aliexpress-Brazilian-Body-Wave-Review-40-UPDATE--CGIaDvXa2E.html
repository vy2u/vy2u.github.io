see-through stuff I've got a lot of
comments asking where did I get 9 times
out of 10 if you guys have an idea or
wondering if I've got some that
somewhere is usually for over 21 or H&amp;amp;M
unless this is like Makino or something
and I'm just a guy from skin this is
just going to be an update because this
isn't hair that I've gotten a crazy
amount of requests to do an update on
and I will have a update week actually
come in sync it's in May for a lot of my
like top acts hair that I reviewed how
is it has held up is it still as good as
than when I got it battling so this hair
you guys remember I actually had and I
still have the hair I'm going to get up
here so guys can actually see how long
it is it's still 40 inches this is just
one side that is the other side um and
this is not the same frontal that I had
when I originally reviewed this case so
keep that in mind this is actually from
another company so I'm not going for the
company right now because it's like I
mean it's like a compensation company so
I'm just gonna say that but watch still
do have the original protocol I just
didn't it didn't work for me frail
especially for this because this frontal
is a thirteen by six so it's way more
party space than the one I had
originally so to the hair
this is their 40 inch Brazilian virgin
hair and this is their strength texture
so I get close as you guys probably seen
in my intro as well this is the exact
same hair
I have gorgeous hair on many occasions
since I've reviewed it and I have some
more things to say about it
since so I did not review back in June
so it's almost coming up on a year
because I've had this here so I pulled
this side forward so you guys can
actually see how long it is on each side
and the reason why this okay the reason
why this actually was sparked I believe
is because you guys know that Miss Nicki
Minaj decided to come out tell me within
is 60 something within 250 Nicki shorted
me and I'm 5 foot 4 she's 5 foot 2 and
at 5 foot 4 when I stand straight up
this actually comes to the back of my
knees tourists come to her side
so I'm making is most likely where 40 or
45 okay and she's not wearing four
bitches I can guarantee is not it maybe
is because it was body wave ish I don't
know
Oh a lot of people have asked me how how
has it like kept up especially because
it's so long how has it kept up as far
as shedding goes and every now and then
I'll get like a nice amount of hair but
it's nothing that has changed I guess
you could say so the thickness the
fullness of it because this is the same
hair just a different frontal but even
then is still full I guess this is a lot
of hair and it's rich it's got some
weight on it too because I believe that
I have four bumps so yes this is for
forties and is it water air card as you
can see and I will say this that this
hair does not like to say straight and I
mean like there's another something I've
reviewed and I've written about their
straight hair because I believe it is
like the whatever and that here and they
have made that hair here 40 I would be
great but because this hair is I will
believe that is yours version and a
reason I'll believe that is because the
poofing is that I get at the ends this
you see this on Nicky's hair too is
because it's very hard to keep this hair
straight as possible because it is so
long this
is definitely like I said this is for
chute hair this is a video shoot hair
this is not everyday hair I tried to
wear this hair twice on an everyday
basis and I got my feelings so hurt you
guys know whether it's a mosquito
fashion show and then I actually wore
this like a dumb because I wanted to
like a barrage of beach yeah all the
sand in my hair
so yeah you gotta just be careful
because you will sit on the chair you
will you you could use the bathroom on
this hair you know you don't want to
don't wear this to the club and get
drunk and then you sit your butt on a
toilet and you sit you and that's all to
do doesn't which one so as far as the
shading goes like I said you get very
minimal it's not a lot but I definitely
get some as far as the frontal goes
reason why I decided not to use it
because this one is a 20 inch frontal is
because when I sat down here as you guys
probably noticed in this area it was
pretty blunt almost and that's because I
had a new pair of sheers and if you guys
hear weird noises because the doctor
playing happy new sheers and I wasn't
used to how sharp they were so I had to
apply we were going to the fashion show
I made the wig then like the night
before put it on I wasn't like a week
before I think I made it before him but
I didn't try it on or cut it or anything
in system layers so what ended up
happening I don't remember what it was
although I remember way back what
happened during that time but I've never
actually just kind of like oh God so
that's why I was a bit blunt in that
initial review that I did so I decided
to switch out the frontal for that
reason also because I wanted a frontal
that was a bit longer in the party area
far as the dyeing process of this I just
would not I would not and the reason why
we're not consist a lot of work this is
a whole lot of work to be dyeing some
hair in y'all life if you want to do it
by all means
it'll take colors I could spend a gene
but good luck see you in your pockets
because that's a lot of leech so yeah I
am still in love with the hair I think
it's great it definitely makes me feel
like a Barbie they put a lot of
unattractive screenshots on the L
Express tour of me like I gave y'all
bitches you know they got like
like I hate when Alex where's company do
that but whatever is your hair do to
women I did trim it a little bit it's
still to say I just literally like did
the ends just so that the ends wouldn't
be so brassy and like you know you need
to turn it your weed before you put it
in and at that time I didn't have time
to do it when I could never view so I
just didn't but yeah and I wish they'd
see the thing about this is this right
here you see wrong you see how this is
such a big difference because it's just
20 and this is 40 I wish they would make
a frontal that at 13 months or six go to
event I was in the 13 by 6 front so that
you would actually go with this oh if I
did a dis that middle part of my hair
would be all one length I don't like the
fact that I have no choice in this hair
but to actually have to layer it and I
don't want it because if I play like I
want to this is going to go from like
842 a 30 real quick so I don't want to
do that because if that's the case did
the feature the purpose I can go just
get some 30 and check out and cut off 10
inches of hair because you know you
layer something you have to do even when
you do long layers you're still going to
take a lot of it out exposing when you
want to curl it so that's the only thing
I think will the only hang up that I
don't like is the fact that the front
rows of my last console from actually
them was 20 inches as well it's just a
big difference in between the two and I
don't really like that I wish that now
that's what Nikki dug up on me that
whoever did I don't think she has a
front although I think she just has um
chuckling so she does everything is even
so I mean I workers at the time I wasn't
doing like on the grading process I was
to give this a 9 out of 10 because of
the reasons why I just told you that the
only thing the hair is still really good
I know a lot of you guys up with the
bobbin here it sold out I just check
their site there should be some 40-inch
there and I'm tipped it by myself to go
by like two more bundles and just do
some I'm not getting rest go out to West
kiss hair because they did a great job
was this forty inches just I personally
just one more thing
I present with a wish the desert was
treated
if it was treated bone straight I would
be in heaven right now
that's the only thing about this that I
really don't like no matter how much you
flat iron is whether you use an electric
fine arts Marcel irons this hair is just
still going to have that pootie look
after well because the elements are
going to kick in if it didn't and it was
treated girl I can wear this in the fall
and just get crazy with you know their
but I can't um so guess that's that's my
update for this you guys have any
questions about this particular hair
please feel free to put them below and
you can stop me if you are not don't ask
for YouTube or Instagram you know answer
so I will catch y'all in my next one
please</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
