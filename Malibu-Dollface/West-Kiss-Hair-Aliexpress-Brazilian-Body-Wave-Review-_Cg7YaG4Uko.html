know I love a good side ponytail just
eesti ratchet and all that good stuff so
I decided to opt in do it since I had
this great front tool from this company
a newer company that I've never worked
with which is called wet kiss hair on
Express I will get to the specs of my
hair in just a second but one thing I
want to say before I even start this was
this is by far one of the best frontals
that I've ever had
due to part it came pre plucked on the
hairline however okay this is a of
course Brazilian body wave so this is
what I'm getting all of this nice flowy
ocean waviness so my frontal is your
ideal darling now I did not however
color it which I'm going to go back and
do but I just didn't have time to do it
when I was testing out this hair because
I have so many other wigs that I'm
worried about right now I didn't have
time to actually bleach the knots on it
however it came pre plucked and you guys
know usually when you get frontals they
look like this
the front tool usually is really edged
up like such and this is to ensure that
the arm around the front of your hair is
actually a thick enough so that when you
go ahead and plug it or you could you
could very well glue or sew it down like
this it's just not gonna grow when I
receive this one I noticed that it
definitely had this nice already plucked
hairline popping off so I didn't plug
nothing I looked exactly like it was
because I just wanted to hurry wear it
so this is where it is which is right
there so we pull it forward a little bit
so you can see if I would have sublease
this all of these knots would definitely
be gone um and it will look even more
realistic but because
for time purposes for my personal self I
just could not do it I decided to throw
it a little eesti side ponytail in this
piece just because it was something a
little bit different and as you guys
seen in my intro it was real hood so I
had to keep my hair real hood with
earrings with five frontal is 16 inches
and is 13 by 4 is from ear to ear and
the 4 is 4 inches from here to here so
my tracks actually start back here and
this is of course made on a full wig to
make my wigs I use these caps now which
has the extra I like to fold it down and
makes it more durable but because they
stretch um it pretty much will fit
anybody's head you don't have to like
measure and do that whole thing so one
thing I did do different with this one
that I usually do is I really put on
front to like really forward now what I
mean by that is usually um I'll put it
right if I do a closure I'll put it
right on the line of the cap and then
I'll cut that little piece out but I
noticed that if I put it on the frontal
mr it would be a little too small so if
I cheated about this much past the line
then it will sit on my head right my
edges is still out but then this is the
frontal which you can't tell where the
frontal is and where my edges start
which is the great thing because my
edges come a little bit further than the
front to allow so I can cheat the two
but still give me a nice little get down
and for an extra option they actually
send me a closure as well to match what
I opted not to use because of course
I'll take a frontal over closure
anything um but this was a 4 by 4 lace
closure that they sit with it as well so
to my bundle length I'm wearing a 16 at
18 a 20 and a 22 so this is definitely
more of a realistic loop um then you
know my very long Brazilian body wavy
like this long um this definitely has a
more of a realistic look than that I do
like it because the hair texture
actually is nice so if I'd actually took
this and slip like really slicked it all
the way down and a
tie ponytail it would be very cute and
pretty her but because my strap was a
little too tiger bag I just cut it up
because it hurt I went ahead and called
washed his hair and I did what I
mentioned in another video I took a
flexi rod with a wish they always sin
when I have body wave hair they always
send them but I rarely rarely use them
anymore but I noticed if you take the
flexi rod and you laughter you go ahead
and wash your shampoo and a good thing
if you wrap it around a flexi rod and
you let it dry like that you're going to
get this s pattern back in so when you
reinstall the hair or you put it in
it'll still have that texture to it a
lot of times when you do shampoo your
body wave here it's going to get looser
so it's going to kind of look like this
if you don't because it's going to dry
long so put wrap it around that's right
and you can don't have to do it with
every little piece of hair you can do it
per bundle you can just take one flexi
rock and roll the bundle or maybe half
of a bundle and wrap it around and I
usually take like saran wrap and I'll
put it around just lightly so that the S
can stake it it's not going to stay if
you do this and so I can dry too so it's
going to dry in that s patter so then
when you put it back in it'll look like
this I've gotten very very very very
very very minimal shedding with this
hair not much at all which is a great
thing so it flows all the way through
like this so I'm looking Spanish nice
and from the root and when I did my
strand test I did notice that my hair
turned a little on the yellow side whoa
or the orange yellow side um before it
actually lifted which most hair does but
this was like really orange II um I
don't know what that's from because my
hair didn't smell like anything and it
was very soft when I received it so I
didn't have any remnants or any smells
or anything of any chemicals when I
installed it however that's that's my
result after I went ahead and I'm
bleached it but other than that I've had
great experience with this hair and they
have I will say this is the best
pre-made front that I've received
because again was already freaking
plucked which is get acts for a better
thing and it was pluck very well it
wasn't just spin around the edges it
actually was plucked so it can match
somebody's hair line
so it stopped so as you can see it's
right here usually after I bleach it the
lace is usually the color of my skin if
it is like if I go like this
you kind of can see that it's much
lighter around here but if you take um
whatever I like to use like a flat
kabuki brush to do my makeup if I just
take that kabuki brush and go around all
up in the lace and all on top of it not
in here because it's go something like
your baby here is blond but if you do
that all up in here you won't be able to
tell especially after that bleach job
you do if you bleached your not um you
won't be able to tell but because of the
simple fact that I didn't have time to
bleach my unfortunately but I'm gonna go
back and do it another time um you won't
be able to see any of this a lot of
times people make that mistake and then
you'll see pictures and flashbacks
it'll be just white like this but if I
do this can't tell nothing so if you
guys are interested in this good ol wet
kiss hair which I will go on record and
say this is my favorite body wave here
by far because my fronts will match my
hair and my hair actually came back to
life after my co wash it actually really
looked really good so right now they got
my boat as a best body wave or la
Express so um let me know if you guys
have any questions put them down I
decided to give y'all some nice 90s tees
with the side ponytail and it's nice
mesh and Calvin Klein um I will get you
guys in my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
