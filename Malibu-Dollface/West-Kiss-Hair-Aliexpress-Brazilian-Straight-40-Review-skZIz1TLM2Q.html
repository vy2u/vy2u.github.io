life through this little piece all right
now so first video back hair is nice and
40 inches and ignant and I got our mouth
like seven different highlighters right
now
so this hair that I am rocking is from a
Alex first company called fashion West
his hair company did not unfortunately
send me any information about this hair
like where the link is to their site I
have an envelope now obviously but
initially usually they send it and they
haven't tried to really figure out where
this hair was on our side but I found it
so as you can see don't my my my one
piece is from who the UH H&amp;amp;M Martin
Margiela collection and I just needed
something to put on something to
showcase the hair so I thought this nice
new bodies will attain my new is
somebody new put it in my mind a
one-piece oh definitely work for all of
his hair so this is how long it is as
you can see Lord yes so this is what
we're working with right now okay I have
it four bundles of 40 and I believe my
frontal is 20 inches which I just went
ahead and cut some layers into so that
it wouldn't all be like one lengthen and
it just stops I've added they had a 40
inch frontal I would have been a super
problem so I will tell you my experience
like I usually do with this so this
company contacted me and asked me to do
a review and all of my reviews I have
been getting really tired of because I'm
like I keep getting the same hear the
same hair the same hair and I'm gonna
try something a little bit on a
different tie so the subject line said
40 inch hair and I was
say the longest hair that I've ever had
new eyes or ever um was my 34 inch hair
from another company and I was really
long so to see somebody put Wilson you
forward I'm lucky I have to do this I
need some ignorant Barbie hair this is
like the ultimate Barbie here this is
like um Hollywood hair barbie totally
hair barbie which is the most slow
barbie ever so I knew initial I know as
soon as they told me I was like okay is
it gonna be straight or is it going to
be closed because it's gonna be curly
I'm just gonna pair this one but then
they don't want you to do straight so
I'm like okay I knew exactly I was like
I'm gonna do a side part because if I do
a middle part with that much hair I'm
gonna drown so I needed something to
open in my face or else my hair would it
be like right here so when I installed
it and literally became a problem from
the day I walk out the damn door okay
can you see the inches darling so I wore
this a couple of days ago which is
Friday to be exact
I wore this hair with my outfit which
I'll put right here to the mosquito
fashion show which I got to go to I was
invited in acute care me so much so I
was like okay initially I was going to
wear you guys wear my pink hair right I
was going to wear the pink hair because
my outfit was the patchwork outfit and I
knew that I wanted to have some color
but the night before between moving and
all of that great stuff things got a
little change and I asked both of my
sisters what book would y'all feel if
that was in my situation what would you
do and they were like if I was you I
would do the 40 personally I would do
the pink the pink is pretty
and it's an option with your outfit but
if I was you I would do the 40 someone
hmm so literally I was like alright pull
out the 40 I did the wig like two three
weeks ago and I have been planning it
but I hadn't really
bored bored I had just word around the
house because it is so long this is
definitely fashion show hair this is
definitely photoshoot here this is
definitely not practical everyday here
because I'm 5 foot 4 ok so this comes to
I'm not gonna do it because it's gonna
look very raunchy if I pull my budget
ah this comes to right above the back of
my kneecap
ok so for me to have this much hair on a
regular day is just really that
practical and it's getting hot too
but for what I'm in a very climate
controlled area right now and I can
pretty much turn an arrow and turn it
off I won't get hot with this much hair
but in regular day I would probably die
but I wore it up to the show got his
drunk okay crazy drunk and by the end of
the night if you guys follow me on
snapchat which will be right here come
if you want to just know anything else
that I'm doing that I don't post on here
or Instagram you can hit me on snapchat
um my hair was still decent by the end
of the night which was crazy to me
so I curled the bottoms of it when I
first received it just to see if it
would hold a curl and I kind of figured
that it wouldn't because of the fact
that it is so heavy so four bundles of
hair which would be all of this it's
pretty heavy and I went ahead and curled
it and inhale it was okay um I can
guarantee that your curls will not last
one I would not want how many curl as
section because this is just ridiculous
to curl this much hair you have to be a
godsend and I'm not one and held it held
the curl for about a good hour and then
it eventually only I want to do after
that was just coming out so I feel like
this hair is great for shrits artists
regularly straight um it comes in his
natural state straight so I just would
keep it like that I noticed that we were
there of the show start will it was
supposed to start at 7:30 Mitchell did
not start it's about 8:30 because there
were see issues and stuff like that we
left the house like at five no six over
oh Jesus so I have my hair on from I got
dressed around three so I had my hair on
from like 4:30 all the way into two
o'clock in the morning and I must say my
hair stayed decent now was by any means
was a perfect no because after the
elements hit it my hair started to get
poofy towards the end and that's because
I put more product up here to make sure
that my frontal was lay down like a ball
to be um did I did towards the bottom
because of course I want my hair to flow
and I wanted to move so it did get a
little poofy on me it didn't get crazy
or anything like I didn't have a fro
down here but it definitely was a little
bit different also it probably was
because I set on my hair and I kept
moving it I had to kept touching it
because it is so much but this is
definitely my go-to liquid I just want
to do photo shoots or just want to be
extra for the day hit the 40 inch I had
to get in my car
let's just have to pull my hair like
this over my shoulder so that I can sit
and actually dry so yeah this is great
or um if you don't plan on wearing this
hair like as an install like such and
you want to do like I Dream of Jeannie
point you sell it beyond take one
something just a little bit ridiculous
this will be the hair because I will say
that it's really nice I get my strength
test on it and it took color beautifully
so if I actually wanted to UM braid the
situation I could thank you for allowing
me to do this because honey baby Jesus
and I noticed that my wefts the waited
that all the cuticles were in the right
direction
that's why I've noticed that my hair was
not tangling up in wood I have to brush
it out a little bit and I've lost my
home in the uber which sucked so yeah
but yeah I I noticed that the the
construction of the actual Web Store
very very nice it had no smell to it it
wasn't nothing peculiar to none smell
like Fritos Cheetos you know cheese
puffs
none of that um and my hair just flows
so beautifully it just moved a bit and
you know I love a good long black weave
you know I'm saying it
well it's really
please you know because this puppy come
on yeah it's another thing I would never
ever suggest y'all get this my chair get
installed and then wrap it at night
no this puppy came off as soon as I hit
the man so um if you guys are interested
click the link below and let me know
what you guys think did you guys like my
ensemble you know and if you guys have
any more questions about this particular
hair put them below and before I say
before I go because I know somebody
gonna say something I had to stuff this
top with some socks because I guess the
way he made this it does is made for
boobs so I just made sure that I stuck
