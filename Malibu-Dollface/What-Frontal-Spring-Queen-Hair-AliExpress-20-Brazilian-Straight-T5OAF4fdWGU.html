review on my current hair which is from
spring hair now you guys know that I
work for spring hair before um sometime
last year early last year I work with
them and I think I had about thirty
inches from them but I just really
wasn't happy with um not even the hair
but it was more so the service like they
were caught they rushed me pretty much
to do my review so I didn't have a good
chance to get the hair and like really
do it up like I wanted to so I'll put it
in the middle part and that's kind of
what it was the review is still up I'll
put a picture of what it looked like the
hair um was really nice I gave it to a
friend
it took color very well she dyed it
blonde but I really have a chance to
really experience them like I wanted to
but this time around children oh did
have I fell in love with this good old
puppy I'm currently rocking four bundles
of 20 inch of their Brazilian straight
with a matching four runs hole as well
so you guys know I've reviewed and had
frontals before but you guys know I've
said I'm not really well-versed in him
until now I was kind of scared of them a
little bit because I didn't know how it
worked in it was it's very different
from a closure so I was a little like
mmm but I think I got it so what I've
learned to do which I haven't done what
I didn't do any of my other frontals
was I plucked the hair line vigorously
okay I was just with some tweezers to
try to get it down to a point where you
could see mice you can see my hair up
underneath it through the lace but there
was still some hair there so pretty much
I plucked the entire hair line so my
frontal stops there and the rest of this
is my baby here so all of this is not
mine the
this stops right here this piece is mine
because I wanted to have my real hair
out on the side because I just wanted it
to look a little more natural um wasn't
too comfortable with doing a behind the
ear thing because I find that when yo
edges look too silky it just starts to
look a little too fake
but aside from that once I ended up
doing it I did I did it on a mannequin
head so I could see cuz it's white so I
can see through the lace and I went
ahead and kept plucking and I plucked
for like a day and a half
clearly not straight because it would be
involved right now but I just kept going
back looking at it kept going back
looking at it kind of going back looking
at it until it started to look like it
was natural because the hell I'm on this
particular front it was so like you just
see where the line stops and then
there's just hair and it's so thick and
our natural hair around the hairline is
not as thick as it would look on a front
or a closure when you stuff like that
you have to be a little more careful
we're trying to make you look a little
more believable so of course you know I
love a good baby here get down just
because I could I thought this style
would be cute to kind of showcase how it
is because technically if I go like this
if this part was down I could do this -
you know like I can do all of this and
you couldn't see at all what was way so
that's the thing I love about frontals
is that they're so versatile compared to
everything else and the one thing that I
do love the most about them is the fact
that if you put them on and write you
can you could really get away with
murder and nobody will really know um so
their frontal I would have preferred it
to be a little more not as boxy as in
the front because they had the dividends
in the hairline like it should but the
problem with that was the fact that it
still was lined up like the hair just
stopped it was no graduate it just
stopped right and it was lace so I'll
put a picture of what it looked like
after I plucked it I don't have any
trouble of it before because I didn't
know where this was going to pretty much
go I just kind of did it and it turned
into this but that's what it looked like
I tried it on um with like no nothing on
my edges or anything I just want to see
how it look if it look natural and I
just glanced at it in the mirror or I
was still getting that will you look so
after that I can't plug it in and kept
plucking it and then eventually it
started to look more and more natural
and the thing about styles like the
style that I have now um
african-american hair is not very
voluminous after you press and flat iron
it it becomes very flat and very it
doesn't do this at the top where this is
going to do this pretty comb-over get
now so the thing about frontals is that
you can still get that look what I
happen to blend your hair with it and
singe it out to try to keep it straight
so after I went ahead and like collected
a whole bunch um I construct the wig
like I usually do and I am promise you
guys I'm going to do a detailed video
because I have another frontal that I'm
gonna do for my sister so I'm going to
use hers as a template to show you guys
how I constructed this one I've been
shrugging the wig like I usually do put
all my tracks in the back my frontal in
the front and then I took an elastic
band that I got at Michaels and tied it
in the wall sewing it in the back so
that all my lace would lay down and it
would not come up at all so that's why
when I do some if I do this it'll go
back down like nothing happened because
that elastic band is keeping it on in
the back um as far as the hair goes and
the closure and is held up greatly I
love the length of this so much and you
guys know I never really give me with
the short hair because you guys know I'm
just a long trip in the heart um but I
really do the lint is like the perfect
length to get something nice and I think
I did a hairstyle like this uh before
and it was short and I was kind of like
what kind of like the short look but not
with the Front's well I think I had a
closure I know I had a closure um but
the hair is actually still nice it's
very very silky it's very soft when I co
washed it or dream when I washed it
because I left too much conditioner and
it had this other than that I wash it um
it was still pretty was still silky
whatever when I originally took this out
of the package it was like butter it was
just and I remember my 30-inch models
being kind of like that
- I just didn't have a chance to really
enjoy them like their you know um so
yeah the hair itself is beautiful and I
personally like this length you know
anything longer I don't think I would
want but this is perfect if you want to
be like she can and you guys seen an
intro of this I kind of went like cuz
this that I got on is stuck on one piece
so this was some some glasses kind of
like my other eye get down I'm trying to
find my Chanel leather gloves to put on
to really give it like sexy but classy
with the fur but you know couldn't find
it so gotta let it be what it is but
yeah I really like it makes a world of a
difference to my hair how my wigs look
with a frontal light and you know
practice makes perfect and still some
things that I want to tweak on this and
I still want to do different I don't
know yet but I really do enjoy this okay
my last frontal when I did it I had some
hair out in the front like all my edges
what's over the frontal but this is
everything is this way in the frontal is
sitting right there and you would you
have to be right near my face to be able
to tell that I had a frontal one but you
ain't getting that close to me if you
ain't my boo no so again this is from
spring hair this is their Brazilian
virgin straight I have in four bundles
of 20 inch and I think my I don't
remember what my closure I mean my
frontal I'm length is but I believe that
it is a 20 inch if I'm not mistaken he's
not 20 dinner's 18 but I know for Becca
it's not longer than the hair so yeah
let me know what you guys think about
the whole front so are you guys into
them do you want to stick to your
regular hair do you want to stick to
your closures um or do you want to try
something different don't be scared
because that was so I'm gonna minute I
was scared I didn't know how I was gonna
turn out I was just hoping for the best
and boom so I'll catch you guys in my
next one make sure you guys click the
links below if you're interested in his
hair and I will make sure I come back
with a tutorial on this because nobody
had one good enough for me to really
understand now that I got it
so yeah I'll catch you guys in my next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
