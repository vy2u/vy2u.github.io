y'all like askew
like why nobody tell me that was
fun you know and it helps and I got on
makeup and some hair because when I'm
just a girl at home her face is oh no
camera especially no HD even when close
to my face y'all need y'all need to know
me that well the Met Gala is a
competition about the Met Gala it was
just a mess it was a mess I just didn't
feel like nobody really did what they
were supposed to do and when they the
ones who did get close to the mark
missed it by oh I'm sure so I don't know
I think everybody else for the most part
was cool like nobody really got it but
Selena Gomez was she missed the that
bitch wasn't even at the same party like
it was you know so
social media blac Chyna's pregnant goat
I I heard that girl miss Angela
Kardashian honey heart pettiness level
is so admirable like I don't think
people get like China is on a whole new
planet OA pettiness you don't like me
you want to go a sixteen year old
girl and we got a child because I didn't
like whatever went on in their
relationship I don't go we didn't he say
 the day when the boy
de cheval the daddy it makes me a
stepson is something like that I don't
know her lyrics for baby will not vote
Oh what is something laughing it is
admirable like y'all her pettiness level
is on a whole new Plateau in a bitch
like he is so here for it so I'm happy
that she announced that she's pregnant
fascia one on a car - he is now they
make sure your preference your
girlfriend doesn't disrespect your
sisters and you know I used to love
Khloe Kardashian I loved her with every
ounce of my bone when she was Fiona from
Shrek but now she's summertime buddy
fine and a bitch guy had sued as she got
a little too much for me
but hey you know para llamar look like
that a workable but they say
yesterday heater had a relapse of some
sorts and he was at a bar drinking
knowing damn well that is not his
college
so the in social media you guys
definitely keep me up on all the drama
that's going on the length of the shade
room I follow the shake room industry on
blast families
I think celebra gossip tears I'm sure
like this I don't know if I follow
everybody because well one person don't
report the other one is get out love the
 they got real real real lazy with a

thank you before they became like the
shape room they used to be all the team
now they'd be days late with the tea
ridin is a diamond each bitch she got
real close
but yeah I need my teeth like as soon as
this pipe and hot I don't need
that lukewarm you know I'm
saying is old my celebrity gossip y'all
know I don't really do videos about
celebrity gossip anymore but when I was
they would have been so perfect because
you know I've been watching loving
hip-hop Holly for me although I heard
that I'm living in Hollywood for a new
season my girl mustika is a bird
so I'm actually excited about that I
don't think I'll be reviewing a guy the
review thing is comment just um up soul
but I have been watching loving Atlanta
and this season so far it's been kind of
whatever it's been cool I don't hate it
I actually like the new additions to the
season the whole mafia family's gonna
kill it daddies but joseline calm down
is not rookie must-see TV for me I feel
like we don't watch joseline to come and
we watch joseline to act love
and acting up I just here for lunch on
our TV which I get it she's growing up
but that's not what we how we met you
and that's not why I watch but who and
then let me see what else what else so
I'm watching on to drag race oh my god
you guys know I love drummers and I fell
in love when I don't be small I think
she's amazing I love you playing you
only owe me remind me of each other but
whatever I just think it's two lips
because they definitely ain't behind cuz
I ain't nowhere near dat all wait it's
just the lips in a lot of our static her
is all the same yeah I definitely am
enjoying the season of drag race I
really hope either
Naomi wins because my Chi Chi devayne
went home
okay I mean not she hurt my heart cuz
chichi was my type of bitch and I think
I was on like TGIF first because at
address she came in with and you know
she was having the cliffhangers on the
heels it wasn't just Naomi but because
she was like a thrifty queen I was like
I don't really think I'm I like her like
that bitch
chichi you had me dying in this entire
season so I don't really know exactly
who I want to win perfect per se but if
I had to just say one right now I'll be
kimchi kimchi I really want to win so
I'm excited to see what is the wolves</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
