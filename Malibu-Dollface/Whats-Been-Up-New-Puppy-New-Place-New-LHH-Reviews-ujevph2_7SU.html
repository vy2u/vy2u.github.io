an update but I got a new puppy who I
got a puppy
um so quick story well I'm going to give
you guys a bit on what's going on with
me and kind of you know what's going on
with my channel I plan to do this with a
different look and a different really a
different look in a different way in a
different my room but since I'm here why
not right so this is my dog Zanotti she
is almost six weeks they she'll be six
weeks next week I got her early um from
the person that I got it from so she
wasn't supposed to be taking from her
mom until she was at least 6 to 8 weeks
but I took it to the vet and the vet
told me that she was fine and um the
food that I have her home she's fine
she's healthy she's ok so she's she's
boo booing and pissing on a regular so
she's quite regular
she's a Maltese and a Shih Tzu mix I
don't know which one is which I don't
know if her mom no I don't know if her
mom's they should sue her dad I don't
know um but yeah I've been having her
for like two weeks now so the week that
I took off last week was kind of our
bonding time and me kind of being a
parent
look I listen having a puppy in
retrospect oh really
no you look your ass no that's
disgusting you're gonna do this oh but
yeah being a dog on a puppy owner
especially is a lot of work because it's
like being a parent she gets up in the
middle of the night she wants to cries
yes to go peepee she's too small to go
sighs so we got the peepee bath she
don't want to use them it's just a lot
when I got her they said they had a boy
and a girl and I wanted a little boy
because I was gonna name him Giuseppe so
I got him and broking went with me to go
get her which I thought was he at the
time and the guy was like always two
girls and then I was like okay well I'll
just take the girl I'm already here
and I really want to cut me you know I'm
like I just moved I need a little
companion and I really you keep pooting
oh goodness
it smells terrible so I ended up getting
her and then when we got in a car broken
see this little diddly right here and
was like oh it's a boy so I didn't I've
never owned like a puppy and all the
dogs that I've seen have been like ten
times the size of her so I didn't really
take it as much I'm just like okay well
I got a little boy so I'm like Oh does
that mean he just does that me so can I
take her to the vet and the vet was like
she's fine and I'm like what is she like
it's a girl and I'm like really so I
can't just now I fell in love I just I
can't give her away and you guys would
think as much as I love wigs weaving
hair I would want a little girl but I
didn't I really wanted a boy but it's
fine so I named her zanotti because I
think you know my favorite designer is
just a piece tonight so um I thought
that would be very cute for a little
girl since she clearly was not respond
to Giuseppe but so far so good she's a
dog you know like she she doesn't think
that dogs do she's only like a pound and
a half
right now she might be a little bit
bigger though she eats like a bull and
um she looks like she's sleepy no oh but
yeah other things that are going on with
me um you guys know that I had stopped
my loving if I refuse
and you guys are really upset about it
which I totally get cuz I stopped in the
middle of the season and it was getting
good but I was so I was already tired
I've been you know we got up to Episode
five and I was just just tired and they
you so you guys know what happened they
kind of flagged my videos and they put a
strike on my channel and all that well
they have given me back all the money
that they took so all my coins are back
thank you um and I also my channel was
restored back to its regular glory or
whatever it is no strikes or anything
and that's because um it's like a like a
algorithm this other word that YouTube
goes through and Briah comm does cuz
yeah I got an email from vh1 saying that
we're sorry for this because we know we
got a lot of emails so thank y'all thank
you but um they got a lot of emails
about you know my reviews getting taken
down
and all that and it was a we don't have
anything to do with that you're that
brat huh that's what they do so they
gave me an allergic letter of apology
and then once I do not like this thing
and this ever happens to you guys on
YouTube make sure that you guys appeal
it if you appeal it and usually they're
not gonna respond back especially
because it was nothing that I did it
wasn't nothing they thought it was the
episodes because I didn't put review in
the title which there are other people
who don't put review but mine were the
most searched on YouTube as far as
living if I reviews went so mine's of
course you're the first one down
so Jason point they they ended up
reinstating everything so all my reviews
are actually available they just private
right now because I have to go through
all of them and fix the titles and all
that but I will put those up and once
loving hip-hop
la comes back I will do I will start
those and make sure we put review at the
end um but yeah I will do those but I'm
just not gonna I might do the reviews
for a TL cuz thumbs over so that I kind
of be my compromise or whatever but as
of right now yeah I'm not doing no more
reviews for no and it's just a lot
of work to but I'm in a new space
mentally and physically so it will
definitely change my mind will change
and shift and go back and forth but I
know you guys really really really enjoy
those and I have been watching just know
I haven't been watching um what else um
I have a room tour coming up and then
once everything is finished like all the
furniture and stuff is like that we got
cuz it's just Minster glow now then I'll
do an actually like house tour of
everything that's going on but right now
I'm just trying to get my room like I
really want it's almost done though I
just have a few frames that I need to
get in a few like posters that I need to
get him then I can go ahead and do that
on my shoes and everything or where
they're supposed to be and then yeah so
and then I have other stuff coming up
like how to apply a closure or how to
apply a so place closure um get ready
with me I have all that stuff coming up
so don't think I just had to take a bit
of a break last week because of her and
I was just tired
I hadn't took a break since February so
it was definitely needed but yeah I just
want to give you guys a bit of
update on what's going on with me as of
right now but everything is fine
everything is cool I'm happy it's all is
happy we're still ignorant you know and
um yeah I got a lot of other things
coming up so thank you guys for watching
I appreciate you guys more than you know
it's been a long journey and we've just
really got started but stay on my weave
