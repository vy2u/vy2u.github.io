back Tuesday because I was like starting
this note Tuesday little regimen type
situation Leah I didn't need to get my
hair done and before people start thank
you I don't know what is the witch all
in my hair in the comments whenever I
wear like this everyone speculative its
weave is real well let me just let you
know about this particular moment this
right here is some weave up in here I
just want to let you know because I
needed some fullness and I'm tired of
wearing my hair I so you know I'm trying
to stop cutting my layers so you know
and I mean I just wanted some we just in
general so I got in the back I got four
tracks in the back just yummy I just
didn't want to do this but since
everybody went speculate I got four
tracks in the back that's virgin Indian
here 22 inches so yeah its inches plus
so what's up so yeah um other than that
I also want to say there is new
necklaces from MV closet as you can see
this does not look like my other
necklaces one because the font is six um
as well as there's no back into this
like my other ones um and they're gonna
start to make these like this on the
site as well my font was made by myself
it's like the Barbie font that you guys
see it as the cursive one but except you
know it says this doll face baby
so yeah these are be available soon on
in these closet so keep checking back
and make sure that you guys like CBC's
closet on facebook as well so to give
you updates when you will find these
available you guys know I'm gonna give
me a new chain door I needed a thick one
you know just get out with it you know
just but other than that I think that's
it as far as my announcements go um the
topic at hand today was something that I
think I kind of gone through I like a
lot of my videos and I was say stuff and
I really elaborate on what was what or
this particular situation so that's what
I'm basically gonna do today
now one video idea which was um I think
it was the living your life for you I
know I had on black
yellow black and yellow in the video and
I remember speaking about basically
living your life for yourself but this
is kind of gonna you know piggyback off
of that and this basically is gonna be
what is your purpose what is your
purpose in life look what are you here
to do you know type situation I think
everybody has appropriate everybody
doesn't purpose and as most of you guys
know it's a Joe saying that you know
your your history is written before you
here so I want to kind of go pretty much
off that you know we can't we can't wrap
a little bit today um so and shout out
to my girl Kim whose birthday just
passed matter of fact I love you girl
uh-huh
so basically what is your purpose I
personally don't know what my purpose is
in life I just know that my purpose I
have a purpose to me in entertainment
that's all I know
um and that little hunch that I've had I
had what over seven years ago has got me
thus far so apparently I'm doing
something right and I'm following
direction in the path that I'm supposed
to be going in where will it lead me I
really couldn't tell you but I just know
that I'm supposed to be and entertain me
you might be graphic artists you may be
a pilot you may be a hair stylist
shut up smart girl Tiffany yeah you may
be whatever the situation may be that
will lead you into where you are gonna
eventually become I mean none of us want
to be 60 years old talking about some
what is my purpose some people do find
out there their purpose at 60 but I
don't think you want to do that you know
I'm saying like you want to try and at
least figure out what is what and you
know then numbers risen so imma just go
off for some personal for me for me um
judging by you guys's comments on
Facebook and Twitter which you can
follow me at twitter which is Malibu
doll face and on Facebook which is
facebook forward slash multiple doll
face um and no I don't mean just it is
it I'm not changing my name about melody
doll face at all but I have another
option because doll face is taken on
Twitter and originally I was taught
these worry so my name is just a face
now as you can see there is no Barbie
there's no boy there's no nothing so
just it's just all
just she's just butt off there um yeah
people ask me all the time you're very
inspirational you basically help me I
don't want to say some people say you
help me become the person that I am
which is not true because you were
always the person that you were meant to
be I I'm gonna say I but one of my
videos probably helped you bring that
and see that you know such situation I
would never take credit for someone
being being the person that they are I
will say I suggested or let you see
something inside of me that helped you
become who you are but I would never say
credit is it is everybody's who they are
regardless of you see it or not it's
there you just have to bring it out you
know it's like situation like a bump you
know you have a bump and you know it's
puss up in there but you just want to
pop it
I don't pop my bums hence the clear face
but I don't pop up once but you know
what I'm saying it's it and when people
just think and you know the pus is in
here but you got to just get it out and
you see it so that's basically how it is
you know Conner that was a pretty bad
analogy but that's kinda how it is with
basically knowing your purpose and life
and what you want to do with yourself
because me personally when I was in high
school I was like I don't know the
I'm gonna do another screw-up
mm-hmm I didn't really have nothing that
I was excited about it honestly in
school I just didn't hurt her you know I
mean I got through it but I just was
like this is it was like a chore
like you know don't we ditch in anybody
watching I am NOT gonna do an indention
don't don't each but you know when I got
out of school is when I started to kind
of see when I got my freedom is when I
started to see what I exactly I wanted
to do as a person and as myself you are
only accountable for yourself you are
only accountable for your happiness
nobody else can make you happy like you
can nobody you knows it like you want
something for your birthday you're gonna
go get it here so because you know
exactly what you want people can
speculate but they don't know and that
applies in everyday life is to people
can speculate who you are what they
think you should do but you know exactly
what you're gonna do and you know
exactly what your destiny will take you
inevitably to become the person that you
are 10 20 25 years from now you know
nobody can tell you who you are better
than you that's the truth
no people may
but to help you see the person that you
are but nobody can't really tell you who
you are better than yourself remember
that okay
people can tell me I'm this I'm this on
that I'm that all day but I Know Who I
am and that's the only thing that really
matters at this point I know exactly who
I am
so when choosing a path in life I've
done I basically went with the motto if
you can't be proud of it don't do it
that's how I feel about it
so if you're doing stuff and you're
doing it under the table you join eight
it's just sneaky as conniving it's
disrespectful it's embarrassing you
shouldn't be doing it if you can't be
proud of you that's why I said in my
last video if you were home b.o.b a
problem and I'm not like I'm gonna nose
and stuff like that I don't think your
body is you know a moneymaker but if you
are that'd be the best one you can have
you proud about being it I can't be mad
at you that I can't what you all four
ways birthday um
yeah basically just do what you do and
you would makes you happy you know and
when you you get opportunities take them
if they're good opportunity opportunity
anger they trust me I know and
especially coming from me imma delve
into myself a little bit in this video
it's Leslie coming for me especially
being a youtuber um I'm offering things
all the time from different people
famous people things that I'm not even
sitting in front in lie there are a lot
of people who approached me to do some
big things but it was not to wait I was
willing to juice with myself to make
this happen you see what I'm saying
everything that you do in life in order
to reach the goal to become the person
that you are it's not gonna always be
something positive it's sometimes it
under being mostly negative people are
trying to get you to do things change
things all types of you know I'm
saying to basically pour your character
so they can have reins on you to say
this person did that and I know what he
did and I know he you know you've never
you people that satisfaction never ever
give people that satisfaction because
whatever they're trying to give you will
only be that for that limited
like I offer at McDonald's it'll be over
before you know it and you're gonna be
sitting in the house regretting things
that you did in order to get something
that didn't even last that long you know
so never degrade yourself and never
disrespect yourself in order to get a
dream never ever and it's never worth it
because when one door closes another one
opens
and that door be so goddamn bright you
don't know what you do with yourself but
this door coulda got you into a world of
a trouble you know if people are here
people always say dollies why you don't
have your own show
you know don't face white because I'm
doing things the proper way that's why I
don't have my own show yeah I'm doing
things the correct way I'm doing things
the longevity way I'm doing things that
are comfortable with me that's why I
don't have my own show get em I will it
happen of course I've been approached
about a lot of people a lot of show but
it's not to what I wanted and that's the
difference you can't settle for every
single person bus car plane frog man
baby dog they come your way first if you
have options you have to weigh them
because one option may be not that great
but another option can be the and
you have to give yourself a bitch
patience is a virtue and it will take
you very far
okay if you are willing to sit down and
wait for something in life then chances
are when you get it you're gonna
appreciate it much more than you getting
it when you wanted it when you get a
card when you do all that waiting and
anticipating and all of that good stuff
by the time you get it you appreciate
all of that work went in to join your
research you don't watch because you
couldn't just brought the car because
they looked at you then when you got
into it and decided to roll down the
street your engine blew up the but you
didn't care about it you were just so
anxious about getting the car and
spending your money on you we're
trending now you know type situation
good or fall off you know saying the
trunk will close because you're looking
at what is the now where you could have
waited a month two months three months
six months a year and waited and got
something that was reliable you could
roll around for many of years it looks
nice it runs great cuz you wait it you
know so that's what I say with people in
life everything that comes your
way is not always meant to be that at
that baking time it's there usually to
test you and temp you but it's not
always meant to be for you and that's
the difference between me and some other
people you know so I mean it is what it
is however you get your way through life
is your business I'm not here to judge
y'all can't judge nobody if that's not
that's not gonna get us nowhere but what
I'm saying is when you decide to do
things the correct way you get correct
results and that's what's gonna bring
you far in life if you sit up there and
just say oh I'm gonna take that i'ma do
this I'm gonna do that this gonna give
me this dissing and what kills me is
that when I act like younger generation
or I see people that write me and say I
want to be just like you I want to be
famous I want to be known on the
Internet I want to have my own show I
want to have a big YouTube channel I
want to be fabulous I want all of this
stuff and I said what do you wanna do
when that's over because in 25 years I'm
not gonna look like this I just wanna
let you know in 25 years
I'm you two probably won't even exist
okay in 25 years reality shows we'll
probably be dead in 25 years being a
socialite for no single reason would
probably just be dead you know what I'm
saying
so you got to think above and beyond
you can't go and just go off what's
right now living for the moment cuz the
living for the moment to keep your eyes
in a moment you know then Lucario's she
still think she'd miss rap supreme and
she still selling me 50 million records
and she doing 50 minute you offer but
anyway um you guys have to look for the
future
you know such situation I use YouTube as
a stepping stone this is not all there
is of just me this is a stepping stone
you know if I can do interviews I can do
commentary I can do all types of stuff
what I'll flub in a line because I've
learned how to do that based off of this
this is a learning experience for me
it's just it is for you guys you know I
am here to grow I'm not here to be
stunted and just
here and stay in a place I'm even just
used to but with you guys too just in
life staying and it's one school
standing is the one neighborhood
standing this one city standing is the
one state broaden your horizons because
there's so much stuff that you can do
why stop and do one thing you know so
definitely you guys when it comes to
finding the purpose it's a lot of
different roads and paths that you can
take but you are ultimately responsible
for what you want to do with yourself
and you can't blame nobody if anything
doesn't work out because you will never
let yourself down and I don't care if
you got the best mama in the world the
best manager in the world publicist
teacher whatever those people are great
but no one's gonna turning back on you
no one's going to throw need something
up in front of a bus for you
nobody's gonna do when she can do for
you that's the bottom line because if I
don't go out there and promote myself
and do what I gotta do I eaten you know
I'm saying if I don't know how to do
what I got to do to make sure - my
future is secure I eaten I'm not getting
further and I'm saying so you may have
people very outside trying to help you
but it's best that you always help
yourself
okay your self is gonna make sure that
your self is always have your own bag
let's just say that always have your own
bag and when you go and try something
new and people try to beat you down
about it you can kiss my ass
and then you'll see when it's works
there's so many people who have these e
true Hollywood stories these vh1 driven
all of these different where people
didn't believe in them and then when
they started to make money and all of
these different things all of a sudden
everybody has so much faith all about
what they should be doing how they
should be doing it and how many checks
they should be good but what would you
add though when I was struggling where
were you at when I was eating ramen
noodles where was you at when I walk on
now just to get something to eat what we
wear then right exactly so that's what
I'm saying make sure that when you do
get to where you want to be and if
nobody ever believes in you know that
you believe in yourself and I got your
back boo because at the end of the day
that's the only thing that you really
have you've worn these words you're
gonna die alone
that's it
died with the person inqilab you went
out alone it's very rare that a couple
dies together unless it's like a car
incident or something but I'm just
saying though but other than that that's
all I pretty much wanted to say about
the topic just believe in you
if you are trying to break into this
whole YouTube thing don't do it it's so
much more to life than YouTube it's a
great stepping stone but at this point
where YouTube is right now everybody's
trying to do it everybody's trying to be
a star for no reason it's not fun
anymore for some people some people make
youtube so unfun so I definitely
wouldn't pick pick school as much as I
dislike school I would never steer you
in the wrong direction and school will
always be there to help you you to not
always be here this is not guaranteed an
education in school is a job is so know
that alright let me go I love you guys
and I will see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
