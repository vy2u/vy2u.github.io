about when your friendships end I wanted
to do this because I think a lot of
times only grow up we don't really have
where we don't really we do not have a
playbook or anything to kind of tell us
when certain situations in life are
gonna occur and personally recently
where people that I thought I would have
been friends with for years we just
definitely don't talk anymore or it's
more so like we're we're distant but a
lot of the distance now that's created
is because I've chosen to separate
myself from some people there are about
4 people that I no longer talk to on a
regular like I used to
a lot of that has to do it you get to a
point in life especially with
friendships where you feel like either
we're gonna ride out together or we're
just not gonna be cool it's one of the
two and I've gotten to the point now
where a lot of times I'm riding a little
too hard for people and they're not even
walking for me and a lot of times what
people do is they make excuses as to why
this person may be the way that they are
or the person makes a lot of excuses and
doesn't take any responsibility for it
you know but I have a lot of friends
that have been in my life who have been
OD selfish like when I say selfish I
mean selfish like they really just don't
give a about anything that has to
do with you but every time you do
something for somebody else or whatever
the situation is they want to open
holler and cry about what they didn't
get or how they feel under under
appreciated and I've made a point to
never be the person to say you know what
with me nobody cares because it's really
nobody cares but you know you will feel
like people that you have been close to
for a number of years that child would
still be cool there are certain people
that I've learned as as my friendships
have went forward that I don't expect
certain things because I know they're
not they're not capable of giving
certain things so I don't really I don't
trip off of it I take them for
everything they are and I take them for
everything that they're not because
everybody isn't gonna do what you want
them to do
that's just how
works but there are some friendships
that I I'm no longer having or I don't
entertain as much as I might have used
to because people's actions have
fractured something that probably can
never be repaired and I'm one of those
people that I will take so much from
somebody because I'm really trying with
them and today pretty much spit in my
face and say you and then I'm over
it I'm just like okay so once they
probably get out whatever it was going
through or whatever the situation was or
however they felt I don't care anymore
like that's what I met with it like I
don't give a what she was going
through because I didn't do it to you
you know I'm saying so it's like when a
person comes at you crazy and a
disrespect you and they say well I want
to apologize because I was going through
something that day I get that you're mad
but that still has nothing to do with me
and I didn't do to you but okay but
I get it when you get mad this is how
you lash out and obviously we're going
growing at different paces at this point
so let's just not and say we did
because you get to a point where the
fuckery level is always at a 10 they do
one thing and you're good so I've had
people in my life where I've helped them
beyond belief to try to make sure that
they were okay
and I barely got a thank you you know
I'm saying it was kind of oh yeah by the
way things type of situation and it's
like I think a lot of people forget and
friendships like I said before being a
friend with somebody is a luxury it's
not a necessity because you don't need
friends to survive they're nice to have
but you don't need them and when you go
out of your way to do something for
somebody the only thing that you a lot
of times want people to do is say thank
you and be gracious and be appreciative
that you went out of your way to do
something nice for them but they usually
act as if you pretty much should've did
it and because you did it
that's on you you know and some people
feel as they're saying thank you or
being appreciative as a way of kissing
somebody's ass and it's not if I
somebody holds a store for me I say
thank you okay if you send me something
Instagram I say thank you because it
doesn't hurt your ego to be nice to
another person especially somebody you
consider a friend just saying so you get
to a point especially if you're a person
in a friendship who starts to feel as if
you're being taken advantage of or if
you needed that person they wouldn't be
there like you were there for them you
know you can't look at them and say if I
needed something today I could call you
because you probably couldn't and if you
did they probably just gonna tell you
you need to figure to out or call
somebody else cuz I ain't got it you
know whether it be money emotional just
supportive I've had to stop being
friends with a lot of people because I
realized that via what I'm trying to do
in my life which is make my dreams come
true and be happy and and and live out
what I've dreamed up as a kid everybody
isn't gonna clap for that and that's
okay but when it's your friends and they
don't clap or they want a half-ass clap
or kind of give you a because every time
any of my friends do anything that is of
greatness or quality I want them to be
know that I am is as supportive as I can
be to them for that situation a lot of
times I don't get that back and I'm one
of those people that I hate the word
jealousy because I feel like people use
it just like hater they use it so freely
because it's an easy cop-out to say
somebody's jealous of what you're doing
but I think a lot of people start to see
and they probably don't notice what
they're doing if you and we're
progressing together a lot of times
people don't really make a big deal
about it
but I noticed that if I start to do
leaps and bounds pass somebody because
I'm putting in a work but they're not
doing it everything that I do from that
point on they have kind of a smartass
aleck thing to say about it
and it's never verbatim you're you know
you think you all of that but it's
always something within that tribe that
they're trying to say to you because
they feel less than as a person because
of what they're doing or they may not be
doing and I've never
to throw what I'm doing it anybody's
face but I've always been want to try to
help my friends progress to do better
and be better because I feel like if I'm
winning why can't we all win the problem
is a lot of adults still are children in
the mind and they don't want to grow up
to understand that I can't drag you by
your hair to do what you should do to
make your situation better and it's also
no reason to be mad at the next person
for doing with the they have to do
to make sure to think back was covered
that's you know saying people do that
but when you are conditioned to be a
certain way that's all you do throughout
your life is be that certain way so
whomever it is a relationship your
friends your cousin's your sisters your
brothers everybody you do that to
everybody because that's what you that's
all talked thing and you do it and you
don't realize you're doing it until now
everything is blown up and everybody's
gone and this happened to one of my
friends recently she was popping off her
but she popped off on me okay and I
don't never go at her and she popped off
on me and she called me to apologize to
say that she was sorry but at that
particular point I didn't give a no
more it was like okay so you're mad at
me you're mad at the world you don't
give a I'm everything in a book
because right now his life is kind of
 grabbing you by the ankles and
you want to take it out on somebody but
she was really mad at her baby Danny she
was really mad at her mom she was really
mad at her dad but she took it out on me
because I was the closest I was the
easiest and she thought I wasn't gonna
doing it but because she thought I was
gonna say well you know she going
through a lot so how much is no but
you're not gonna vent on me I ain't do
 to you okay I didn't give them kids
automobiles but you sometimes I don't
think people get they take their
frustration out on the easiest people
with a lot of times it's your friends
and people are under the impression that
once your friend you're gonna always be
a friend to somebody and I don't work
like that because it's only so many
times that a person is gonna take your
 before they say I'm good okay
I'm good you know is friendship doesn't
mean anything if it feels like it's
one-sided you know
people are not going to stay around you
and your awful ways of thinking and your
attitude towards things and people
because you feel like it
that's not how life works so if you are
going through something and you start
taking it out on the people near Shu and
around you instead of directly going at
the person that is supposed to be for
you're gonna lose those people and then
you're gonna look up and then you're
gonna realize I up all my
friendships I no longer have real
friends in my life anymore
I have associates that I'm trying to
make front do with friends and everybody
friendships work differently but for me
I realized that the end started to come
when I stopped giving a and I care
about everybody in my life so if I get
to the point where I just don't give a
 and I'm tired that means you gotta
go because I don't want nobody just
coasting around that I could give a
about that I don't talk to like that
that have hurt me in ways and never said
I'm sorry you know and again I get sorry
is the thing that you may not hear from
a lot of people however and we were
supposed to be friends and we were
supposed to be cool then sitting down
with another person and telling them I
am truly sorry for how I have done you
you and positions and things whatever it
it could be so much as a text message a
phone call you didn't do what you said
you was gonna do the agreement that you
made you didn't stick to it could be
anything you have to be an adult and I
apologized profusely for what you have
done because it is hard to sit back and
act like nothing happened and continue a
friendship when you know the
fracture and that friendship is busted
disgusted and cannot be trusted and then
I'm one of those people you do something
to me that I don't like and I know it's
really up my trust for you goes
out the door and then I don't want
people in my life that I can't trust if
I can't trust you you've gotta go period
and I don't think that that is a and I'm
not saying after one up not to
ups three fuck-ups this be a plethora a
be like feet toes hey
 ups and it's like I can only let
 ride for so long for somebody that
I'm not I'm not with we don't
have any relationship type of ties for
us to be having these problems were
supposed to be fraying things are
supposed to be good but if we're going
through this we'd know because
friends oppose to make life a little
easier when you start making harder
for longer oh good okay and I don't
think that that's a wrong thing to say
and I don't consider myself by a
longshot
a selfish person I used to be as a kid I
don't want to share with nobody it
could be a crayon it could be a
royal blue crayon that I was not using
and yo ass wasn't gonna use it because
it's mines but as an adult and when I
got a little bit older especially as a
young adult I realized that doesn't work
it doesn't because everybody is not
blessed to have what you have so when
you do have an opportunity to help
somebody out not as charity not as you
just saying well I'm just wanna make you
feel bad about your situation no because
I really as a friend just want you to be
better and I want you to do better and I
wanted to give you an opportunity that
you may not have gotten any other way to
make your life a little bit better when
you take those precautions in those
steps for the betterment of another
adult another friend another kid and
they still pretty much say mm-hmm don't
care
Davis like all right we Narns then we're
not friends and that's not gonna be an
easy break for you to make from a person
especially somebody that she was cool
with and you have been friends with for
a number of years it's not gonna be easy
because those people are so deep-rooted
in your life it's very hard for you to
separate from them however and it
doesn't mean that you guys will never be
friends again it means that when they
when it cooks for them you guys are
gonna be good again if you feel like
that relationship is something that you
want to go back and try to nurture to be
better but you know what they say once
there's a crack in the mirror that's not
you nothing you can do you can ignore
the crack but it's still gonna always be
there and if a person is not willing to
change and be better not for you not
your friendship but for the betterment
of themselves y'all never gonna be cool
if they don't want to do that and learn
to to man up woman up and be better for
themselves y'all never gonna be cool
again because it's always gonna be
something and I refuse to fight with my
friends I'm not gonna do it whether it's
verbally physically I'm not doing it
because once it comes to that point
I'm just so good cool we ain't cool and
there are a number of people that I have
no longer cool with and people ask me
about and I never say a bad word about
them because I'm good and there's
nothing on this earth that I can say
about a person badly that's gonna make
me feel better about us not being cool
no more you know and then there's people
that I've had in my life for years that
I've never crossed me and never done
anything but be more than supportive to
me for what's going on but it is true
what they say when you start to progress
and you go on like you've got to leave
some people behind because they still
stuck and they have not got it yet and
it's okay to move forward it's okay to
be better it's okay to do better it's
okay to want better in life so don't let
nobody take what you have worked for and
because they're not there again they
want to make you feel bad about this if
you go buy some shoes they got something
to say you gotta buy a car they got
something to say you buy a ring
at the 99-cent store they got something
to say and it's always negative it's
never oh it's always about what you
shouldn't know God and it's like damn if
I would have brought us both one you
would have been good but because I wrote
it for myself and I work for and I
shouldn't I got it
but it's a lot of in the world that
I see people doing I don't have a
comment about because it's not my
position to comment about I let you live
I let you do you and I let you ride the
 out I thought that's what friends
did but apparently not so when you start
to see your friendship going to the left
have a conversation with whoever you got
that issue with and if that person does
not want to take accountability for
their actions and you have to take them
so because if you do it
wrong you have to take them to but if
you know you haven't done nothing but
being good to somebody and they still
don't want to take accountability for
what they've done you cut the
cording you keep it going because
like that that is what people call toxic
friends and you don't want them in your
life when great things start to happen
because that's how you start to rain on
your own parade because you have the
wrong people around you and it's the
God's honest truth and it's not just
friends it's family too there are people
who are conditioning a certain way to
keep you in the mindset that they've
always been and they don't want you to
progress because they don't want you to
see that that you have done better than
them and sometimes it's family
sometimes it's friends sometimes it's
your significant other but again when
all is said and done make sure that if
you see an issue with what is going on
between you and a friend that you nip
that in the bud because I'm gonna
tell you I have been through that and
it's not fun but I can tell you this
when you start to let certain people go
out of your life and they have no idea
what you're doing and you're living life
and you're doing things you start to see
the people who care for you the most and
they want to see you do the best and you
notice there's a dark clown missing and
I'm like the fact that it's gone and
this has been numerous friends that I've
started to see the light with like I
can't I'm good you know and again it's
not that I have any bad feelings it will
are negative things to say about them
you just at a point where I'm not at the
point and therefore we cannot be
cohesive s2 because we're in two
different lanes and we often as people
are never on the same path but if you
can't be respectful to the other person
because they're being happy cuz you're
in the ugly place then that means that
you're not the friend that you should be
to them at that time and you need to cut
course sometimes you learn I'll have
people be like I was gonna come over and
kick me without they so before I even
bring that negative energy over to you
I'm gonna stay home I can appreciate you
for that because you know you and it's
caught being self-aware a lot of
 ain't self-aware what they
do and they never do anything wrong and
they're so perfect and they don't make
mistakes
that's how they said and you think if
you knew
we'll be doing so much better but I'm
not the one to judge cuz you perfect you
do what you do okay I'm just gonna keep
my ass over here minding my little
business so sometimes you gotta cut the
ties and the end of a friendship
sometimes it's hurtful sometimes it's
hard but sometimes it's necessary and
you got to figure it out and like I said
you may not always be on in that place
but sometimes you really got him off for
letting nigga know I ain't that one I'm
not that one it's so on it so many times
I'm gonna let you sly because we friends
you know so just wanted to go ahead and
say that a lot of people have asked me
about that particular topic and because
I've been through that firsthand I feel
like it was necessary so I hope you guys
are enjoying a video as a ma and I would
catch y'all later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
