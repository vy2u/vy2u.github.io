it's training thanks Tim but um Tiffany
is my hair that's what our who does my
braids let's play that off um but yeah I
wanted to let you guys know that it's
more videos coming I'm sorry
this week I actually have to do a
shitload of them to make them up to you
guys as a winner of my contest I will be
announcing probably tomorrow because I
will be doing videos tomorrow but it was
really late in the day it's like five
o'clock I just got home I'm tired I
didn't get that much sleep last night so
I'm really not going to do videos today
but I had to come to you guys real quick
and let you guys know that I am still
here please don't give up on me I
appreciate you guys and there's just a
lot of stuff going on with me because of
you guys I have new opportunities that
are coming up
and I'm trying to basically balance the
to balance doing videos what's going on
and my regular life so it's a lot going
on right now but don't think I'm leaving
because I'm not yeah Hara but shout out
to all my people I also want to tell you
guys too because some people were a
little bit confused I have new
management now so that means I have a
new Twitter name because I put the
longest time I wanted to drop Barbie off
of my name even though I always need
rock face Barbie and Barbie boy and all
that I did but I definitely want to
take the Barbie off the end of my name
and just be doll face I didn't want to
be duckling Barbie even though that
basically solidified me on the internet
which I'm grateful for but I just don't
want to be stopped face Barbie for the
rest of my life so I just want to be
that place so since doll face was an
available on Twitter
um I ended up changing my name on
Twitter from dogs a Barbie to Malibu
doll face just like not who are you so I
still have like a Barbie esque feel to
it but it's not Barbie so yeah um that's
about it if I'm not mistaken I have a
video that I'm actually editing right
now that should be I'm not gonna say
today because I'm not going to show but
I'm going to actually work on it because

while so yeah I think that is it if I'm
not mistaken but thank you guys so much
for the support I have not forgot about
