guys are like every four letter word is
comin at cha off right now I am so sorry
but I have been really really extremely
busy with life and um entertainment
stuff like trying to get my right
and it's getting right like JLo so yes
um do not be upset with me it's going to
be a good situation and yeah okay so
there's a few things that I want to talk
about this video and then after this
video I'm gonna do like a regular video
that I usually do and I got a rant on my
ass about something we can all relate to
but anyway um I want to talk about um my
birthday you guys know that I turned 24
on April 10 if you didn't know now you
do um you know I want my gifts I'm just
kidding um but I turned 24 it was 10 my
party though I'm not gonna have a party
on my birthday because that's a sunday
so we're gonna have a party on the third
that following thursday at east west and
west hollywood um it should be a flyer
across your screen right now if it's not
then you can get it down at the bottom
with all the information the event is
only 21 and older so if you are not 21
and you stay in Los Angeles I am sorry
but your mama should have been a little
faster with you I'm just kidding but
yeah I'm sorry I might have something
that's 18 and over soon but for right
now this even is 21 owners so yes make
sure if you are in the los angeles area
everybody's invited um make sure you
dress to impress don't come in freaking
t-shirts and fitted hats please don't do
that because I will not be intact so
please don't do it and none of my crew
people will be with that neither okay um
another thing that I want to talk about

celebrity hair stylist Dario passed away
a few days ago and I never got to meet
him personally but we did speak on
Twitter a few times and he was sweet as
part of me and my condolences got to him

very very sweet person and he's
definitely gone too soon so um shout out
to him and his entire family and
everybody you know that he knew and
touched and things of that nature um

think that's it if i'm not mistaken
that's our job at the party as a job
while the contest I'm sorry I think

much it um so yeah oh and let me ask you

notice what you want to see and then we
can do this but i must make a video or
