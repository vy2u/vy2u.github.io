Kim Elliott um hi guys so I'm here to
review for this hair that I'm wearing
which is from let me give my it's from
white label hair and you guys know I
have um work with them before I did my
exotic Eurasian wave hair that everybody
keeps asking me to update which I'm
going to update but I just want to give
you a like a precursor and reference to
the hair for those who are asking the
hair is still the same in my opinion
since when I first got it the only
difference is it's not as uniform as it
was it's like the curls after I wash
them they drop so they actually looked
more like this than I did when it was
more of that tight ringlet curl so I
would get to that I'm definitely going
to update the hair because actually
still really like the hair but to this
hair this is their Brazilian body wave
and this is five bundles and a frontal I
know I never had no frontal pho but i'ma
tell y'all right now while April hair
this sub-base frontal is about that life
because I absolutely love it just I'm
like I don't really think I want to ever
go back to a closure now after having
this frontal but I did it like I do all
of my um my wigs that I make with my
whip the hair I just put the wig and I
put the frontal it goes from ear to ear
so the frontal goes from here all the
way around but the silk base is only
like from this section from here to here
and to here the rest is still lace on
the side and then I put all my tracks in
the back this hair actually took very
well to me like because sometimes what
happens is when you get body wave hair
and you run your fingers through it the
Harrison house wants to tangle but this
was actually like buttery soft and he
just ran it just went straight through
so that was the good thing about it it
didn't give me no issues I did Co wash
this hair so this is what it looks like
after this is what it look like before
when I first got it the only difference
was it had that like that S shape you
know the body wave shape so that's the
only difference that it had but I'll get
a close-up so you can
to see the texture of it it has it's
loose wave to it it's um after like
pretty much brushed the body wave out
which I didn't I just finger comb dollar
this I'm sure if I brush it it'll get
much bigger than this um but yeah I love
the frontal aspect of it in fact the
frontal does match the hair texture
which is the second time I work with
white label hair and I will say that
they're they're closures and the hair
always are on dead point like they match
to a team which is great I had to go
through which I need to do some more
click like click because the closure
stops right I mean the frontal stops
right here so then this is all my tracks
in the back and because it was a frontal
all my tracks are in the back of the
lake versus on the side so my hair is a
little heavier at the bottom than it is
at the top which this is the first time
I ever used a frontal so I'm still kind
of like getting familiar with how to
install it but yeah I just did what I
did with a closure just pretty much like
a big closure at the end of the day is
what it is but it does create more
flexibility because I can't take this
hair and do this
on this side too and it'll still be good
if I had a closure this will all be
trucks right here so that's the good
thing about that now the cons of this
hair on the one major con that I've had
with this hair is that it sheds a lot
and again I cut my West because I was
using a frontal so I did I couldn't go
from here to here with the West I had to
keep them in the back sock I would have
more hair and I wouldn't being able to
use all five bundles I didn't need all
five bundles and I wanted all five
bundles in because of look how big and
thick and rich it is you guys know I
love Barbie hair so when it comes down
to it I love to have big giant thick
hair and if I'm giving 12 bundles I'm
gonna figure out how to put 12 bundles
in so they sent me five bundles and the
frontal so I'll tell you all of the
lengths that I do have uh I have 226 is
226 is in 324 so my longest is 26 my
shortest is 24 and I don't
recall what length my frontal is want to
say that this frontal is probably about
twenty twenties probably not really sure
um how long my frontal is it'll be at
the bottom in the description but I
don't really recall how long it actually
is but it does give me this nice bang
feel the reason why I didn't part it or
put it in the ponytail is because I
actually want to straighten this hair to
one see how it is once I straighten it
in to UM see how it looks straight as
well but I can't it has a nice depth as
far as parting go so I can get real
ignorant with my part with this frontal
and also I probably do it oh I'm just
going to do a demonstration video which
I'll Flatiron it on camera and then
style it like that so you guys can kind
of see more of it but this is pretty
much my initial review of this hair and
how I feel about it I actually really
like it
I know some of you guys ordered my the
exotic wave um and then there was like a
little bit of issue with that but
everybody who has contacted me I've
contacted them and they went to try to
rectify it
and fix that situation so it happens and
I also want to make this very clear
because a lot of people don't get this
they'll see me in this hair and then
they'll order the hair and then your
friend might get her powder might be
exactly like mine and then you might get
a pattern that's similar but not the
same it may be more of a curl than a
wave or maybe more wave than a curl and
you have to understand the thing about
hair especially virgin hair is that the
the donors are different so that means
that means that if you have a crow
pattern and your friend has a curl
pattern her car pattern and yours may
not be the very same so whatever the
donor is the hair texture and will
change so that's only way you can
guarantee the way you can make sure to
target the exact same texture is that
the donor is the exact same and or if
the hair is process if you process you
can make sure it looks exactly like it
looks on mine so it just really varies
because I know IV review for them too
and her hair texture was different than
mine so it just really depends on you
know the donor and eyes
I mean I've learned that with hair just
because somebody here looks a certain
way you would want
to look like that but it may come
looking a little bit different um it may
be a little more um curly it may not be
a little more curly just really depends
so yeah um that's my review for this
hair again it's very easy it's very
low-maintenance it didn't give me no
issues as far as washing goes the only
right that I have with it is that it
does shed a lot and I think that has to
do with the fact that see like if I do
this then I'm getting like that and I
think it might have to do with the fact
that I cut my lips and I wasn't very
careful with cutting them so that could
that could be really my fault but I'll
see usually after a while it does
subside you know and it'll stop bull see
I've had his hair in for I have had an
emphasis week so I've been wearing it on
and off for about a good week and a half
um so it tells you on the when you get
your labels it has their Instagram and
their website name but it also has these
use and don'ts on the front of what you
shouldn't you shouldn't do it with to
and what not to do as far as the hair is
concerned I believe my other ones I
think my exotic leg also came with those
instructions I don't know if it on a
package or in a card but I know that it
did I remember seeing those instructions
somewhere so I'll come back with a
straightening video for this particular
hair um it's going to take a while
because um yeah I liked it I don't know
if it's going to go back I got a see um
and this is a lot of hair to be
straightening so you and I when I really
get the time to do it I'll do it so
don't rush me all right I'll talk to you
guys later and let me know what you guys
think of this here bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
