trust how do you trust friends new
people in your life boyfriends whatever
uh I'm insane you like through a series
of things and kind of explain ways to
kind of trust new people in your life
that you do not really too sure about
the first thing that I would do because
as you guys know I'm I have a lot of
friends and a lot of us a whole lot of
associates you know but my core circle
of people that I missed with is very
small because I don't trust many people
not because I have like these SuperDuper
bad trust issues the people it's just
that I know how people are and I kind of
take that for what it is you can't like
give everybody the same type of in
and expect the same outcome because that
just don't work well especially when
there are very spiteful and vindictive
people who don't give a about you
and only thing that they want to do is
either you should get what you got or
get who you got it'd be like that
sometimes but anyway um what you can do
when you're not really sure about a
person's motives are what they are what
their purpose is what their mo is is
start plant little wise just small white
lies they ain't gotta be like crazy but
just little lies and be like oh well I
told this person one time an example
this guy had never liked no me before
and he just made me told friends so he
didn't know anything about me what I
look like as a child so I liked him and
told him that I got my lips done and I
was like at 16 my mom had like I really
was serious that I was like oh he was
like your lips are like incredible like
which I find when people say to be
really disgusting but okay um he was
like your lips are incredible like my
mom I'm one to get her lips and I said
at sixteen I asked my mom could I get my
lips done because they were really small
and I didn't feel like they fit my face
compared to the roundness of my jawline
so they can I get um some injections and
I wanted some collagen in my lips or
whatever and he was like really I was
like yeah because I think it would be
really you know cute on me so at 16 that
was my 16 presidents that have get in
the car and I said it like that like he
was really like really like he was
really into it next thing I know there
is someone talk
I tell you about bitches with fake lips
that want to walk around here talking
claiming I think black with you know
doing what other races do today
like just starting the whole thing and
I'm just like really so he know my
cousin and my cousin came back and was
like do you really believe that he got
his lips done like that's really kind of
stupid used it to someone fact that
that's my cousin we have the same lips
so I mean the exact same lips I mean he
went to a damn good doctor to get the
exact same lips up everybody else on our
family so that's how I kind of knew that
no like if you don't go to run back and
tell that because the the point was
using when you are not sure about
somebody they've done something well not
always do they do something but
sometimes you're just not really too
sure about this person and how they act
react or what they do or whatever so
sometimes you have to do stuff like that
to kind of see if stuff like not like
that is going to get out sometimes you
do have to tell bigger lies because
sometimes people like that they think
stuff like that is petty but if you tell
them like girl when I was 16 I got an
abortion I mean obviously I wouldn't say
that but you know I got abortion or my
dad now lives in Rio as a transsexual or
my grandmother used to date Martin
Luther King just something just
outrageous to see if they'll run back
and tell that what somebody that you
don't even know if they do that and they
think that it's cool and they think that
that's all right and mm-hmm
then you need to cut them all cut them
at the knees because we as friends we
confide in our friends our friends
become our family and sometimes friends
are better than family but I digress
depend on what kind of family you come
from it's cute but yeah you have to be
careful because there are some people
who just don't like to see people happy
like they just want to see you miserable
and what makes a person even more
miserable is when they sit back and they
have to basically have everybody
whispering about what they're doing who
they're doing what happened oh girl I
heard that she had this or she she was
messing with socialist or now he's
messing with some song so like I'm sure
that's how Gabrielle Union found out um
about the little baby do you a guy going
okay whatever
um but yeah you know I'm sure that's the
type of thing and I'm sure somebody
started that like you know like people
are just ruler they'll do things that
are ruthless to you just so that they
can get a some people bask in other
people's misery and you don't want
people that are friends around like that
like why would you want somebody who
does not want nothing but the best for
you they just want to see you suffer and
be upset and be sad and and go through
this and go through that's not a friend
that's a friend of me somebody who wants
to to know what you're doing to see you
in your time of Vernor ability pissed
off ness upsetness they'll sleep with
charm and I turn around and be like well
he came on to me so you shouldn't even
be mad at me like that you should be mad
am I shouldn't be mad ahem bitch see
bitches like that you favorite cars
bitches like that you light on fire
because they just don't get in they
think that they're wrong they're wrong
czar so right because they were not the
party that initiated it when they
probably were but the whole bros over
hos I don't believe that if you're my
friend you would never step to my ex
current or future dude like that ever
that is not what friends to do so if you
have a friend that slept with your baby
daddies club with your sister's baby
daddy who slept with your mama's
ex-husband that's not a friend that's
somebody who needs to go they are toxic
they are a problem you cannot trust them
you couldn't trust them with a dollar
and get four quarters back that is not a
friend that is a problem that is an
issue and you do not want that in your
life especially if you're going through
like a personal struggle or some
like that and you just don't find this
person to be any type of conducive to
trying to help you either out of this
funk help you through something help you
just become a better you that's what
friends do my friends go to things I'm
there for them judge Freeh shade free no
palm trees no nothing
I don't care what you did I don't care
what the situation is I don't care as
long as it's not nothing that has Diab
its gonna do anything wrong to me or or
you ain't okay bitch but if it's
anything else I'm there for you no
problems judgment free cuz who am I to
judge somebody I don't have no heaven on
the hill
nobody and so it is what it is at the
end the day however people do this all
the time and then I see it on Twitter
and I see you know Instagram people
saying oh this is my BFF for life and
then the next thing I know they suck on
my some I tell you about fake bitches
they centigram in talking about some
what we were who we used to be cool and
all this that's because you let people
in your life too quick and you trust
people too quick
people are out here ready to take you
down at every beckon call especially
when they see that you have something
people act tell people people tell me
August time I act funny
they say that you don't really like to
get to know anyone you're very
standoffish
you're very dis you're very that and
it's the truth they lyin
and I'm like that for some of y'all you
know y'all can never keep real friends
like every year it's a new group of
people it's like rearrange the bit it's
like the game you know it's like the
show is just like take her out put her
in take him out put her in there is no
everybody continues to keep changing and
real friends don't come and go like that
those are associates those are past time
bitches those are Expendables those are
extras those are not friends so I think
the definition of friends have changed
meaning your trust for people have
definitely changed which is an issue so
if you don't trust a person you think
that they're shady you think that
usually your gut does not lie to you
it tells you the honest-to-god truth and
your gut is telling you this person is
the issue mine just like I click this
wig bye that's it I mean there's nothing
as simple you should never be harder for
friends a lot of us I mean I could see
if you're 17 18 and you're in school and
you see this person every day and you
think that your friend and you learn but
if you're 20 25 you know I'm saying 30
40 and you're still making the same
mistake this person who's been around
you for years and I don't want nothing
but to use you abused you and dismiss
you and you still trying to figure out
that you're really your friend I have to
now wonder what is your mindset as a
individual are you mentally there do you
not see it
are you just playing stupid like being
stupid is a choice you and I'm saying
like I think people forget that like
being stupid unless you have
the mental capacity of a seven or eight
year old just being plain of dumb and
stupid and naive is a choice you see it
but you don't see it you you see it but
you don't get it and the only person who
pays for that in the end is you so and
you don't want to look stupid and then
you want to talk about it what kills me
is that when y'all do this y'all sit
back and dog the person that you once
called a friend there are people who I
no longer with but I still would
never dog them to the general public I
ain't gonna say I never dog them to my
friends but I would never dog them out
just in the atmosphere you know I'm
saying like oh well the reason why we
don't talk it's like it's noise none of
your business
stranger bitch why we don't talk no more
we just don't and it is what it is you
know people want to get in your business
try to figure out what happened and why
and this and this and then Cenac know it
is what it is
keep it to yourself you guys we need to
learn to keep your personal business to
your self next topic
so yeah um I hope this is gonna help
somebody remember is everybody's not
your friend and I'm not saying that
everybody isn't your friend but just you
get a feeling fix it if you think they
trip it and they fake and a phony and a
full of leave it's not who you need
in your life it is too many people there
over what is it 10 billion people in the
world I don't know girl don't don't get
too close me it's a billion something in
this world and we got all these social
medias you can find a good friend
somewhere they still exist trust me
so watch your back watch oh man I'm just
saying though cuz we just today is
ruthless I mean I'm saying I'd like
something happen to me but nothing has
Mitch try it but um I hope you guys had
a great Valentine's Day by the way that
was yesterday I did it was actually
really fun one of the better Valentine's
I've ever had so hope you guys enjoyed
