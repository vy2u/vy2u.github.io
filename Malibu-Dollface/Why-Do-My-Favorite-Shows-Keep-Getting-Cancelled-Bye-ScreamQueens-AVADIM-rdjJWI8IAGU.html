I didn't give them the Oh yesterday you
know just go ahead tack another poem no
love me no and I hope you guys enjoying
the video a day in May that's going on
right now this is a lot of work for me
didn't normal but I'm enjoying it
because I'm able to share and do and say
and it's not just reviews and business
it's more you know personal it seems
like every single time that I give a
show that I like it gets canceled okay
now y'all know and you didn't know I did
a short for sprinkling I will post it
somewhere it'll be an annotation or a
link below or said whatever so she's got
going on right now and scream queens was
announced that it was cancelled which I
most of us pretty much got the gist of
that after season 2 cos it I tried I
tried
alright I Drive but yeah Nietzsche was
gone for most of the season I just feel
like they should have took them out a
kappakappa Tozzi make sure all like even
though it was jail and all that the
first season I feel like they should
have been they should be like community
service and college or something it was
just way too fast too quick and I think
that's why a lot of people tuning out it
wasn't as popular first season as it
could have been all those very popular
on social media but I'm not shocked that
it got cancelled I'm not even a little
bit so that sparked something which was
I noticed that I have a pattern of like
II showed that always get
canceled so here's a few ringer on the
CW don't have on Fox hi y'all remember
Heidi was like SNL meets MADtv it only
had like one season and a lot of skips
reporting but it was one bitch named
cocaine she's like a rapper on her home
her brother were like he was like Eminem
but they were like from the suburbs it
was the best ever Melrose Place on
the CW minute CW we don't have the best
relationship at all
Cheeta even on the key that got six
episodes to close out the season it was
still consider camp la complex was
so good I knew Kathy steal from Degrassi
and in the game of the storyline with
the rapper girl and it's on it's on
YouTube of y'all wanna put the la le
complex the gay story later come up one
on one which I thought was release to do
because we even know it's Breanna
Reggie or not Sweet Valley High know
y'all know okay Owen the game Kelly
Pitts was originally she has a twin
sister named Brittany Daniels and her
name is think Cynthia didn't know her
name is Brittany Daniels for sister name
is Cynthia Daniel but they used to be on
the show Sweet Valley High Dam which was
based on the book and you around my age
like between 25 and 30 whole then you
won't know what I'm talking about they
always had they were in the same section
as baby of his club and the Goosebumps
book it was my in a guy can't wait
to come walk around Baywatch huh just
because I just feel like Custer could
have got one more season the river be
done with all of homie we have a lot
history with them so that's all I have
oh yeah Kenny was 101 spinoff remember
palak's
no mop flat okay you guys serve around
with it link to the trailer below the
present was like the original Empire
okay it was like a family of people
Wonder Girl kind of unless she can be
Lauren London poster and it was about
his family in his record label I got
just hit me like that was the original
Empire later you might oh please
don't don't think the present oh you
want to give me a job I will take it
The Secret World of Alex Mack I just
feel like first and foremost to this
very day I don't know what the
 that was wrong with Alex Mack all I
remember is her ass look like a
capri-sun
after some ever sir but it was my
show
Rey and Alexis Fields was you know there
were some people of color and a show
that was just
one of a multi-cultural okay the Lodi is
not that anymore
impeach the theme song Sepideh peeps
still makes me cry and I don't know why
but I think it's because it was just a
time in my life what was like six
Stickley and we nerville and uh all
these things around Nickelodeon during
that time for my generation of kids of
all that just my brother and me it was
all these shows that were just so good I
would literally watch Nickelodeon all
 day myself it was more of a
Cartoon Network person I was a
Nickelodeon kid
dead-ass me and faith go way back are
you afraid of the dark was like the
original American war story okay - the
kids in the woods were fired and sand
and remember the episode where T
and Tamara it was by the chameleon and
Tamara was the Eva went and Tia was the
nice one
and then at the end you thought spoiler
alert you thought that she killed her
vision her all she says the wrong bitch
girl a little water pay the price bitch
that was much any one of my remembered
was the one about the doll the bitch is
so dusty a powdery mess girl it was yeah
as told by ginger now recently mimic
disease to watch this we were kids and
then I moved away and she start watching
other and like I said she was more
of like a I mean a cartoon or person she
didn't know that ginger got real deep
like this bitch like Darren had cheated
on James no he got with Simone and then
her appendix or some ruptured they
got real deep when I got high school
taina yards we already talked about that
in my tiny review shot out to my bro
play Marisa with Angela she's doing her
saying now shout out to her okay okay
kid Christina Vidal where you at girl
cuz I would love to see that one more
game from Buster
salute your shorts was another that's
another show that made me when it's a so
bad to go to camp back that invoke juice
were to show that just made me want to
go to camp so that it was
ridiculous and undress on MTV
funny note
Darrell who was on Noah's Ark which was
on local which is another show that I
cancelled prematurely Thanks logo look
one undress Easter like lure girls into
his room so they can have sex with him
it was the MTV show days to come on like
really late at night I still have some
promos on of you just tape somewhere but
that was just like I feel like no Alert
was just like that was that's my gay
Bible okay like that was we got two
seasons in a movie but it still don't
mean to me because season two was
not like season 1 and the movie I felt
like was a little oversight but I'm
saying what I can get because Moishe was
canceled too and we didn't get no
 last episode we didn't know who
was pregnant but clearly it would love
so I just I don't know why it seems like
I fall in love with the Chozen as soon
as I get to invest into them they get
canceled the same thing happened with
scream queen when I read first and now
scream queens I was like when I watch
initiative I said how the I want to
know what the budget works for this year
because there's way too many people in
this case that are not okay like
wouldn't do how those checks being cut
but I watched the first episode and look
I was like this is the best
airline ride Murphy did bachelor to me
like the best thing he did because it
did I love American Horror Story and I
watch American Horror Story since season
one not on y'all season three bitches
who came in talking about some on
Wednesdays we wear but
okay I've been there since murder house
American Horror Story always missed an
element which was a teenage element
until season three and cousin is one of
the most popular seasons as of yet but I
just feel like Ryan has his issue where
he starts so true and he ends so weak
the finale of Roanoke was one of the
worst finales ever okay I feel like I
lost the Super Bowl why couldn't
he just be somebody else crazy
why didn't have to go all that legs
and titus she shouldn't even been in a
season be who she she plays Oh Leon Oh
coming but and you know what we're good
- who plays Zoe on cousin her mama
played the mama on Bates Motel and then
they're laughing for me good and I
didn't put it together until I seen a
picture I said if that don't make
the most sense okay talk about it I mean
yeah and I live in Bates Motel - and I'm
happy that they came to like Indian
properly but I just don't understand
like why all of these shows get so much
promotion in the net get cut and I feel
like right I don't know if I can invest
myself into any of more of Ryan Murphy's
new projects I was in a Glee fan I
didn't like popular so when it was like
a drummer he's doing like a horror
comedy all like oh no I'm not trying to
watch Sean of the date or some like
that you know so and then I would have
put screen the series on here but they
did you cancel they just got a Holden
care so that's not technically designed
but whatever - I feel like when you have
show that you love and then you get
invested and then they cancel them
love-juice were cancelled on Disney
Channel and I still did it they don't
know why the signature Jackson God
wrestler Lee Thompson young soul it was
cancelled and like I know Disney Channel
has it where after so many episodes they
automatically cancel the series just so
it won't burn out and they'll start
something new so I understand like
raisins house you know this newbie is a
spin on a vessel Raven we have Corey in
the house
you had all these different things which
I appreciate about Disney Channel they
don't just kind of pull it in - it's
just like a girl let it go just like
they announced recently that scandal
asked after I think the new season
that's it or it's a season after I don't
know I don't even watch scaling no more
how to get away with murder came to and
just took all my attention I remember
with scandal Tuesday as a scandal
Thursday that girl come here what the
 Olivia Pope ass is doing her face
of any of Cyrus the baby all these all
here so I feel like
now shows especially because we have
shows or like streaming services now
like this is show on this let's call 13
reasons why girl is thatting one of the
most interesting shows I've ever seen in
my life that she is good
santa clarita diet on this list was good
as and i like the fact that able to
take a show and binge watch it as
opposed to waiting each week i've got
accustomed to when i don't have anything
to do or i just ain't gonna do with a
landfill to do i like to just sit back
and watch shows and i want to see what
happens from top to bottom in the season
or do it out like that's why I love
about orange is the new black although I
don't know how I feel about this new
season so far since it shouldn't been
leaked on a minor but I feel like
you know like orange is the new
black it gives you a chance to watch it
at your own pace just don't get on
social media are they gonna it up
for you um I know my sister has
up breaking bad for me I didn't get a
chance to watch to like the last episode
and she told me I couldn't watch the
show bitch told me I was like you were
sighs I pitch it out all night mm-hmm
so how do you guys feel about if you are
a stream clean fan how do you feel about
the show ending and do you think that
there should have been another season
did you like season 2 most people didn't
I sure the did it I think season 1
is the holy grail of what screen clean
is and I believe that Chanel Oberlin and
Roberts performance as her is going to
go down in history she's going to be up
there with like Regina George and
Courtney Shane and like one of the best
teen young adult villains of all time
and fabulous at doing it so I just want
to know what you guys think about this
were you a fan of spring clean or any
other shows that you guys like that you
feel wrong I feel like ringer was like
Sarah Michelle Gellar's way back and
 CW that up that was a good
ass show and I feel so robbed
when they said Oh Siobhan going to be
their sister and here it is
I feel like we should come back for no
no you guys didn't come back did I say I
when you first came on I didn't watch it
right off the bat and I'm a toaster
we'll about it and he binge watched it
on the CW act and I was kind of doing a
thing and then it was coming new
episodes we were watching them then so
we didn't start out the game we relate
we were we was coveting in it so I don't
know like I don't want to get invested
into any more show that I can't stream
that still go based on ratings because
if everybody doesn't have time to watch
then the show gets canceled and then
something that has such great light to
it is now gone I won't say I did get to
go to the set of screen clean season two
and meet everyone well most of everyone
and they were very very nice but the
atmosphere was very positive Jamie Lee
Curtis is one of the flyest bitches and
I mean that with the utmost respect I've
ever met in my life I can't believe I've
met Lewis Road but I did I was able to
you know just see the atmosphere of just
how they operated and you could tell
that it was a it was a special place I
got to see Taylor Lautner I'd say been
doing what I was yeah yeah I Blair so I
don't think he knows anything either but
it was it was a positive thing so how do
you guys feel about this do you feel
like shows get cancelled super
prematurely do you feel like Ryan Murphy
is doing the absolute most when it comes
down to his shoulders and he don't give
them enough time to actually spread a
wing because he's so worried about
American Horror Story just like pushing
thoughts below and your shows that have
been canceled and you sound off okay all
my adult house fans y'all know what I'm
talking about
I'll catch y'all in my next one hey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
