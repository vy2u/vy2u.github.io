crazy amounts of messages asking me what
happened with my love and hip hop
reviews and what's going on with that
ended it out so I decided to answer your
question as to why I am NOT doing any
more reviews anymore well first off um
youtube just had this issue with me and
it keeps happening and I'm over it
because it just keeps getting repetitive
and I'm just over it i'm tired of trying
to appease people and they're not
understanding my point on it you know
i'm saying because you can repeat the
same thing over and over and over again
but everybody is not going to get it so
it's just kind of what it is so what
I've decided to do was do this vlog
because I feel like I don't really do a
lot of these anymore um so this is what
prompted me to do it what I'm trying to
do right now is just kind of get back to
what i like to do because my channel has
become morsel of what other people want
to see and what they want to see me do
and i totally get that when you kind of
get in the brain farting you don't
really want to do everything anymore you
like what can I else can I do you know
but I got to a point with those reviews
where I did them first season because I
really wanted to enjoy the season it was
something different with something new
when this season came along I tried my
hardest to try to get into it but I just
couldn't and I'm just over reality TV
right now unfortunately i'm only
watching things like Empire and scream
queens and stuff like that I don't
really watch much reality and I do keep
up with the show and Hazel's gone and mo
nice and rich are going to whatever
they're going through and it's too many
I'm not here for Milan and his little
boyfriend Mouse's situation and it's
just a lot of stuff that I just
personally don't under I don't find any
interest in it so naughty please darling
please so um I've just opted not to do
it but what really turned me off of
doing it was when I did the first
episode and a reason why I did it is
because you guys were super duper like
excited and
loki was excited to about it I was
excited because Atlanta hey got ruined
because of YouTube um go really variety
I'm not even YouTube which is YouTube's
laziness um and I just kind of was like
you know I'm maybe we can try this again
since he's the one went off without a
hitch even though I was tired and
because I got so many other things going
on um I kind of stretched myself a
little thin because people don't
understand there is a lot of work that
goes into those reviews because i am not
like everybody else I do take pride in
what I do and I do want to offer
something of quality and if it's not
gonna be a quality then I just
personally don't want to do it so that
was my point um and then when I did back
to my original point when I did what I
did was broken what happened was people
were you know talking very down about
her and she's one of my best friends and
it's like kind of you talk with me but
you don't with her you have a lot
to say about somebody's appearance but
you have no photo and it just became one
of these things like while I'm also
trying so hard and I get it was not
everybody but it is kind of true 11
Apple does spoil the bunch I just I kind
of got to the point where I was just
like I don't want to do these reviews
anymore because they don't interest me
anymore and if I'm not having fun
there's no point of me doing it you know
i watch this stuff enough or care enough
about this stuff to continue to be
interested in it you know I'm saying
that type of situation I just pretty
much mind my business and I see a lot of
things you know social media like I'm on
east and reaching together but they are
together then you have phys and kamiya
or going back and forth and you know
it's just i don't care i'm watching a
lot of scripted stuff right now but I
don't want to review these shows because
I feel like when I review things they
become one out to me because I have to
watch you more than once I have to
really study it I have to give you a
person that's probably not watching the
show a thorough prospect and perspective
of it so that you will like it as well
you and I'm saying you can feel like
you've watched it as well and I feel
like for me right now when it comes down
to TV it's just that I just want to
enjoy it I don't want to talk about it
want an opinion about it I just want to
watch it and I'm not gonna put a review
up of something that I have not put my
stamp of approval of course as far as
quality goes so some people just like
well don't do the screenshots don't do
it store just kind of talk about it and
overview but I don't want to do that
because I feel like that's not something
that I want to stand by and again
regattas how you guys see people on
YouTube is that our content is something
that we take pride in and if we start
doing it half-assed it's gonna look how
fast and I don't want nobody to review
anything that I've ever done and be like
oh he just kind of threw it up there it
was something that I really thought out
and that's why I was at the end of
season one of loving about Hollywood I
was so tired because I made sure that I
put forth the effort of quality that I
would want to see from someone it just
wasn't just anything you know and for
some of y'all that could work but for me
that doesn't work so I hope you guys can
understand my point because if I'm not
passionate about something I can't do it
that's just the end of the and I try my
hardest this season to do it but um
after it kind of just the things that
were said about broken and then the way
that things were done um and just some
of the comments that I've seen from
people it kind of ruined it you know and
it was like I already didn't want to do
it but this kind of just put the nail on
it you know the nail in the coffin for
me so I have a lot of other stuff like
you know my truck he updates and i have
stuff working I'm working on for
Halloween but as far as right now goes
living if I was dead and i get it you
want to see it but I'm not willing to do
it you know it's just I'm tired of it i
don't find an interest in it and as a
person i would like to be respected for
my feelings because a lot of times on
this channel people want me to just put
my feelings on the side or the back
burner for the betterment of them but
it's like it's not about you you know
it's about me i have to make the content
so if i don't like it why would happen
still do it you give them saying the
great thing about hair is that i can
become anybody so it's endless I can do
so much I can do so little it just
depends on me but when it comes down to
it people don't understand that you
gotta do what makes you happy and you
gotta do what you love in order to be
happy and whatever you do in life
and I'm learning that I can't appease
everybody so I'm sorry but I'm not sorry
get it all right I love you guys and I
appreciate everybody who's rock with me
and understand my point in those who
don't I don't know what to tell you
there but I love you anyway</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
