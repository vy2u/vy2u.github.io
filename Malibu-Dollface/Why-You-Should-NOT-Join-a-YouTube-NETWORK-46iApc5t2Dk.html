more subject videos and I get it guys I
get it but life is what it is I can only
do what I can do um but this is going to
be a video entitled why you should not
join a YouTube network so often a lot of
you guys ask me I'm starting YouTube or
even my fellow youtubers actually like
have you been approached by any networks
and you know just what has your
experience been I get these emails every
damn day every day Planet Fitness or
whomever and and stylehaul and all these
people hit me up all the time we could
you know increase your revenue and we
can do this for you and we can do that
for you and I had actually wrote
something on my Instagram about this and
I was pretty much saying don't do it
because these companies are here they're
pretty much still from you that's their
point and I'm sure I'm not going to get
any of these emails anymore after this
video but um this is me speaking from a
person who has a big following you know
for the most part I don't have a million
subscribers but I'm at the 1/2 million
mark almost you know so I'm speaking
from that experience so a lot of the
times this is the starter youtubers that
are asking me these questions so that's
why I decided to do this video because a
lot of you guys asked me to go more in
depth about this subject so you guys are
not aware a YouTube network is when we
youtubers are paid at the UM the 22nd or
21st of the month of every month our
Google checks are paid through Google
but what you could do is um and we
pretty much pay for the advertisements
that you see either on around or during
a video so that all is added up at the
end of the month and well almost the end
of the month and for that 30-day period
those sends you a check now what the
networks do is there'll be a separate
network um they still have advertisers
but they pay you versus Google pay so
Google has a partnership
with YouTube because Google is owned
what YouTube is owned by Google so what
they do is they pretty much be the
middleman between the advertisers so
they give you specific advertisers to
advertise on your channel so Google is
probably random or whatever is closest
to what you do so if I do here you may
see a banner here for some a sale on
Hair Weave you may see our and the
beginning of my video it may be a
trailer for a new movie coming out just
depends so what they do is they pretty
much will send you a letter or tell you
we have 4,000 people on our network
right because as more as a hell of a lot
of networks we have point other people
on our network and we want you because
we can increase your revenue by how we
have of what Google's paying you and you
just give us this percentage and then
get more money when them up comes now
here's the catch have you ever thought
why what I need you to help me do what
I've already been doing the thing about
Google is as long as there is no funny
activity on your advertisements meaning
there is no flake fake clicks or
anything fraudulent going on your
channel um then you're good you're gonna
receive a check every month
there are a countless amount of people
who have said that and I've never this
is me coming from just doing research
and I did some hell of a research about
this and people pretty much said as soon
as you did something that they did not
like they held your check so unbeknownst
to probably allow you guys some of us
youtubers we are job is YouTube we don't
work a nine-to-five job so let's just
say I do a video and I'm signed to a
particular network and I say and do
something that they just don't feel is
appropriate okay now again this is
called YouTube not there to not yotube
my tube okay this is my so if I do
a video and I'm pretty much like you
know I
this bitch this whole this whatever I'll
give you about six inches whatever and
they don't like it they will hold my
check until I do whatever they ask me to
do we just need to remove the video put
an annotation on the video whatever they
request you have to do in order to get
your check now the thing about YouTube
and anything social media related is
that it's your platform to do what you
want what I did because I can't get in
this thing is I end up getting the
manager so now I have a manager and we
go back and forth for my hair reviews
and all that and we just bounce off of
each other this is what they claim to do
they give you a personal person is going
to come to and if you ever have problems
like copyright issues or whatever what
people don't understand about these
people they're sharks okay and the only
reason why they're in business is
because they need you to stay in
business okay you don't need them your
channel will continue without them they
need you because the more people they
have in their network the better off
they're going to be when you get that
email as that we have like you know
20,000 people in our network well guess
what if you have an issue and you have
about 1500 subscribers and I have an
issue and I have what it what am I like
320 mm I'm going to come first before
you do and that's a problem because at
the end of the day the smaller people
are need they need the most help if I
just steam has an issue and I have an
issue she's going to get quicker help
and in a quicker haste because a bulk of
her revenue is going to them so she's
now priority versus you you're not
making me that much money so I'm gonna
answer you when I feel like it if I do
that's pretty much how you looked at so
when they send you this email and they
tell you all we have all these people in
our network they're using the smaller
people to show you a number so you
believe that all they have all these
people that they're helping to get more
money they're using you as pretty much a
ploy they need people with bigger
numbers to come in so they pretty much
Jedi mind trick you to believe
hey they got that many people I got this
mini they don't get any more money I'm
messing with you a lot of you guys asked
me about my youtube journey you guys
know that I've been doing this for quite
some time and I will say this you guys
are the reason why I am standing here
okay you and God are the only reason why
I am standing here today what people
don't realize is that your audience is
the reason why these companies want you
it's not about it's these numbers that
matter to them it's not about you as a
person and how great you think you are
because they're people I watched I got
50 hundred scribers who are way better
than girls who got a million okay
so it's not about that it's the numbers
that matter and I will tell you from
firsthand experience do not put your
hard work in the hands of somebody that
you've never met a day in your life
because they can do what they want
they're going to tell you that you have
full control over your channel and you
do not it's so there's countless just
look it up don't take my word for it
just look it up they're here to get
money from you that's it
why should you share your money it's bad
enough that Google wants what they want
okay and to be quite frank with you I
don't think that we're good
ask is too much of anything I think that
it's our is a proper amount for what
you're giving it could be more trust me
it could be more and I don't know what's
happening so recently because Google
used to be popping in there it seemed
like the bigger YouTube garden were you
to read and all these other stuff they
really skip it on our checks but it's
what it is but I will say I trust Google
more than I trust a stranger let's just
say that and these companies all we have
this person we're working with this
person but we always look at that email
these people that they're there their
name dropping in our name dropping Jaime
Hong who got 1500 there um talking about
Michelle Phan who got millions there is
a difference in the two so don't allow
all your hard work to be diminished to
this stranger because they just want to
make a penny off of you so what I did to
do a little research because of course I
get these
emails all the time and I always tell
them no and every time I tell them no I
always get the same reaction well may I
know why you don't want to do because
we'll do this we'll do this
shut the up you're not going to do
anything you're not going to do anything
I let me let me explain something to you
guys the money that a lot of us
youtubers make for doing what we do we
put back into our channels this camera
was not free this light is not free this
backdrop is not free this jacket was
free from the rich this jacket was but
you have to as a youtuber when you get
to a certain point you have the
production value into your channel and
you guys know I used to sit on a tour
and used to use natural lighting now it
is almost 12 o'clock midnight and I'm in
here doing videos and full Technicolor
but this took a time this ring-like was
not cheap but those who really invest in
their self and really want to make sure
that you guys get a great production
they're going to put into their channel
some people say oh they're going to make
me as big as this person I'm going to do
it in half the time and then you end up
signing the contract now that's that's
the other side of it what people don't
get is this is not a pay-as-you-go
monthly service no you sign a contract
which are real name not your new YouTube
name your birthday and your real name
stating that you will stay in a contract
with this company for about two years
two years is probably the lowest I've
seen I know some people have gotten
deals from certain people like stylehaul
for about a year but within that year
you cannot leave you are contractually
obligated to stay with that network you
can't figure out how to get out of it
quicker and then the really the
thing about it is a lot of these
companies know when your contract is
going to be up they'll stop with the
returning emails don't make sure because
it's staked in your contract is if you
do not say that you want out of it and
it's acknowledged by the company you
will get another two years so it's like
a real it's like a bad phone of a phone
company you know and I look at a lot of
you that are coming up and I don't have
anybody to tell me this but when I
started we didn't have this when I first
thought it we didn't even have
damn your Google you know I'm saying so
I'm og this game but um I'm making this
video because I feel like a lot of you
guys are watching me and other people
and you're thinking that's what we're
doing and a lot of us have done that I
just haven't been one of them because I
did a lot of research so back to my
original point I started a gaming
channel and I'm not going to say the
name of the channel but I totally
anonymous and um you guys know I like to
be an investigator about so I
started a gaming channel and I would
upload videos twice a week and these
would be like less please now gaming
videos often are taken down for
copyright infringement which was my
intention because it states that if you
ever have this issue that your network
is supposed to be the network that helps
you get out of this and they can sell
Google or the third party who's claiming
set copyright but because things like
games are fair use then you pretty much
send them and say this is not you know
copyright infringement I'm using it as a
let's play I'm able to do that under
fair use um usage so they usually take
it off well I had this issue on my
gaming channel and I joined a network
and I will not say the network's name I
hit up my manager and I said I'm having
issues they blocked three of my videos
um is there a way that you can help me
no reply for two weeks when I got a
reply he said this is not our issue and
it would be in your best interest to go
ahead and take the video down take all
of them down and maybe you should try
something else
I said what my channel is based on
gaming and he said well we don't handle
copyright issues I said well it stated
in my contract and I find a very bogus
contract I signed the contract as a John
Doe so there was no way for them to
pretty much is attached to that channel
so I'm good
pretty much I was told off
because we can't help you and the
channel only has 3000 subscribers
okay so you compare that the three
thousand two to three hundred thousand
that I have now if I have an issue I can
guarantee you
they would have figured out anything
they could do to try to fix that because
their cash cow is now on two legs and
they need that money if I was you you
make sure that your hard work is not
being taken from you this is like the
old 90s hotel I was so rich and famous
but I was broke that type of situation
if you're putting your money into your
channel don't sign with the network and
share with the stranger because you
didn't go to them they came to you and
if you did go to them and you feel like
you need some help or some guidance in
order to try to make your social media
platform pop my best advice with you
would be to get a manager okay to get a
agent because what they can do is you
can tell them what you do when you don't
want and what you're willing to do and
what you're not willing to do these
people are God knows where and they're
going to do it whatever they can to get
a dollar out of you this person
especially if you're paying them
yourself they're going to do what you
ask to make sure they get their check
when this person is they're going to
take you sign over your rights to say
that they take a portion of your check
every single month so if they take what
they want and you need your card no pay
or your renters do and this is all you
do for a living they will pretty much
give you and you're going to be tapping
your feet at a point where you like I
cannot wait for my contract to
be over so that's why I wanted to do
this because I think a lot of people and
it's something that's not really talked
about often there are videos about this
subject but a lot of times youtubers are
so fed up and they're so mad about the
situation that they don't talk about it
and there are a lot of ways for you to
make a living on the Internet
but they're seeing that in there pretty
much like sharks and you're the prey and
people fall for it oh my god
Sean's always with them oh my god my
favorite youtuber my favorite beauty
gurus they're assigned to them I'm going
to sign because I want to be like them I
want to have the numbers that they have
I would have the viewership that they
have the difference is a lot of us and I
mean a lot of us we started from nothing
and we've worked our way up to where we
are now okay
and it's been a for us sometimes it
with a quick ride is sometimes it's been
a slow and steady depending on um where
you come from and what at what point
YouTube you started don't get
discouraged because things are not
looking like the next person just follow
what you're doing keep it very very very
fluid keep it very realist as you can
make it um as a person and as a
personality nobody wants to see a thick
person in front of them be who you are
but don't don't get taken advantage of
because people are waving free things in
your face and you're like oh my god I
just see dollar signs because that's
usually where things go wrong and these
companies they're out for that very
reason so hopefully after this video I
no longer get emails about joining
Planet TV in and stylehaul and all these
other places that I don't care
about you know I'm saying I get this is
their point just don't be a shark and if
they're if somebody does offer you
something great and make you get it in
writing and it looks great by all means
do what you got to do but if you know
that it's and you know you've
done your research and things just ain't
adding up run for the hills ok
because these people want nothing with
your money don't let somebody else reap
the benefits of your talent because
that's that's pretty much what we hear
every single day we got TLC we got MC
Hammer we got Mike Tyson with all these
people talented Brook and it it all work
don't let somebody be your donkey just
so I'll catch you guys in my next /</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
