the day but you guys probably give this
probably three weeks apart I don't know
um so yeah we're not been in a few of
the situations especially regarding my
phone I'm gonna let y'all know about
that too but I think I just been really
busy with life and just open stuff going
on and also I I did lose my passion for
doing this like I really did and I
needed a break because it was so much
going on and I feel like people were
tugging at me wanting me to be the I
guess you could say the solver of all
problems because that's basically what I
do people were coming to me with like
all of these issues and I'm just like I
can't do with this because I have my own
life and I'm not trying to be
insensitive but people don't understand
like there's a lot of people asking me
for a lot of information a lot of hope
at one point like I can't be I can't
save everybody you know as much as I
would like so I really can't so it
became more woman for me and I just had
to step away from what you know well and
do my own thing you know but I'm back
and I'm not leaving for a permanent
amount of time although I did say that
on Twitter I didn't say how long I was
leaving I just said that I was leaving
you know so that was basically it like I
just needed a break
basically you know and sometimes if you
feel like that you know like certain
situations in life you have to step away
from them or to understand how much you
really enjoyed them because it was just
such overload it was like video after
video after video after video and I just
felt like a zombie I felt like a Barbie
I just felt like I'm just stuck like you
know so yeah
nothing serious I want to address that
it was some somebody I don't know who it
was somebody started a rumor online that
I had committed suicide because I wasn't
here for a month now it's one that's
really sad that she would think because
somebody has the life and they don't
spend all the time doing videos I think
we just killed herself that's pretty
stupid
um and I spoke about suicide before so
that wouldn't be something that I would
be inclined to do um so yeah you kind of
struck out with that one buddy but I
hope you're watching and our
you're happy that I'm back and you stop
spreading rumors because it's real
classless
um what was another question that people
were asking me
um I don't know maybe that was it okay
so let me get to my phone yeah let me
tell y'all wedding happen so John no I
was a sprint customer correct okay yeah
I know where that's pretty I went off on
sprint I had this big ol rant okay so
this is another ring cuz I'm gonna tell
y'all what they did when the fucking
iPhone 4s camera i'ma tell y'all how
they try to play us players so myself
sir will and broken all of us had spring
okay now I had a blackberry so will had
a blackberry broken has each has Evo the
forging one not the 3d one so I'm like
okay cool whatever so I'm thinking to
myself every single year we would get
upgrade for our homes and I'm just like
okay so we're not we get a credit I
guess you could say for each year that
you were wrist print so they gave you
the first year you get a $35 credit and
then if you don't use that credit then
it'll go up to 150 in your two years to
read me that's how that you should have
read in your contracts so I'm like okay
so it was rumors it's like I was not
only used to at this time cuz I'm little
could we like to get the iPhone I can
finally get rid of my blackberry because
I'm sick of rim you can kiss my ass so
I'm like if we just get I phone because
I didn't want to go to vice and I didn't
want to go to AT&amp;amp;T so I'm like okay cool
whatever so then I'm hearing all these
rumors I'm like keeping up with
everything that's going on like
clockwork like seriously I was like a
crackhead so I'm like okay we're gonna
get the phone it's like all of these
rumors pointing to us getting the phone
so then I end up going to I think it was
Mac monomers calm and they were say said
that Sprint was gonna do away with their
yearly a great premium program which was
um which was the seventy-five dollars
per year
now what I did neglect to read was I
read wrong okay and they sent me a
letter but they send you
like a week before but I read it wrong
like think I'm done doing because I'm
forget I'm a premium customer I thought
there was some extra stuff they were
just doing that other people had I
didn't know that had any bearing on
anything that we were doing
so everything was announced the phone
came out and all of a sudden tell me why
please tell me why I called him as soon
as the phone was released right and
found out found the hell out that my $75
was gone
got gone finito disappeared
voila vamoose gone and I'm thinking to
myself like are you really serious right
now did you really like it am i tripping
so I caught I'm calling a lady like okay
explain to me what happened because I'm
about to use this $35 to get my phone or
whatever talking upgrade cuz I have an
upgrade EJ they were telling me this as
I was calling him they were telling me
this so I'm listening to like yeah bitch
whats up you know Becky what's what's
going on you know Judy what the fuck oh
yeah you know we might get the phone
just stay with us and you never know
what can happen something is to myself
like okay so the phone comes out I call
them
we're discussing I am Oh like I'm on
their ass I am going D fuck off like I
was pissed I was so pissed I was shaking
I was pissed because I feel like
somebody cheated on me like you told me
all of these and then you turned around
and did this to me right when I was
there like spot to just do what the hell
I had to do you gonna do this to me so I
was just going on I was like how much it
does it cost for me to cancel my
contract cuz I don't want using means
that you're gonna cancel they'll be like
okay we're trying government trying to
help you he didn't give off about me
because they knew they're bugging you
all these new customers or whatever um
for them to come to Sprint
so I ended up hanging up I was on no
mind you that conversation though I was
on hold for 53 minutes the reason why I
held is because I thought they were
gonna fix the situation
I know and then the phone just died went
out you know spread has really bad
customer service every nigga in there
and I mean
me grow up in there needs to be fired
because they need some manners cuz I
mean I'm a paying customer you know so I
called back and I really went off cuz
I'm pissed away not only was I pissed
off hung up on me like Pharrell so this
bitch gon tell me we were waiting for
you to like answer and I said bitch I
was on motherfucking home for 353
motherfucking minutes bitch I didn't
hear nothing but that wack ass dude a
talkie bitch shut up already got
unlimited bitch
so I'm pissed off at this point so then
they say well I can't help you or
whatever but what I can do is since
you're having problem because like I
have promised my blackberry I don't get
fucking service like I'm supposed to I
don't want the phone anymore we can we
can buy your blackberry for $17 and then
we can give you a credit for $35 towards
a noob I said bitch let me tell you
something listen I don't want to buy
shit from you I don't want the stop
trying to sell me shit bitch I don't
want nothing I want or I want out can
you fucking cancel my contract I'm done
so she's like well we can give you
unlimited everything cuz they see that
you have I didn't have unlimited any
time minutes I had unlimited mobile to
mobile and I had unlimited data so I'm
like I don't want none of that bitch all
that shit you talking I ain't trying to
hear it I don't want that leave me the
fuck alone can you just cancel my
fucking contract please please please
cancel my shit please Becky please
transfer me so then she got a little
attitude or whatever and I said don't
meet you no motherfucking attitude with
me cuz you motherfucking center field
line is your time to take advantage of
your fucking customers so they got a
little attitudes or whatever so
basically what they try to do is they
try all the existing Sprint customers
that either was not with them for two
years or more or not a new customer
coming into the company us us me sir
we'll we were left in the middle so all
of us got fucked so basically they told
me I would have to pay 649 fucking
dollars just and yet a new phone and I
said bitch either you smoking are you
sniffing but you're tripping for real
like what the fuck I was like spending
that much money on the phone I goes to
300 hours furrier I can understand okay
I get it I get it
phones or x-men
now they do more than most cars to do so
besides drive your ass so I'm like okay
cool you know whatever I'm just and at
that point I was just over it like I
don't want to deal with this anymore cuz
they pissed me off
like I said up here I could have been
left you know saying went somewhere else
I could have been left but then we're
really pissed me off is that you fucked
over your current customers just to get
new customers and I'm just like I don't
give a fuck about none of that unlimited
shit none of that extra shit I'm out so
with all that said I'm currently a
Verizon Wireless customer so shout-out
to all my homies a Verizon how y'all
doing so and my phone was only $1.99
mind you and my bill is cheaper than it
was as friend but then this is the
catch-22 this is so we'll left to mind
you my homie let's and he was 18 Tito I
mean it come with me too I'm surprising
cuz Verizon they done everything but
give me a house phone for that much um
but yeah so I'm currently Verizon
customer I've have horizon for the last
two weeks no problems within a week of
me having Sprint I had issues so
therefore I get all amazing service in
my room cuz my room the way it's
positioned I get really bad wall I was
getting real bad service with that
Blackberry I was dropped
I ain't dropped one call yet I was on
the phone for eight hours straight don't
ask for who but I was on the phone for
eight hours straight with no problems
and then on top of all that that my 4s
keeps a charge that my blackberry it did
but I didn't do shit on the phone so I
really can't test out the abilities
there but um yeah my shit I don't I
don't know about anybody else I can't
speak for you and your battery on your
iPhone 4s alright well I know it suppose
me better than iPhone 4 it's still the
same difference y'all it just three is
the shit that bitch is my friend asked
her I said actually by Lady Gaga she
just said she don't understand and I
which I won't get her either you know
like we hear like I saw was she lesbian
she said it's not about her it's about
me
so that's yes um actor was Beyonce
pregnant she says she just don't
understand she don't think so so I mean
it's um but yeah I love my phone I love
Verizon fuck Sprint you can kiss my ass
and then on top of all that I found out
that uh and I think may know March
spurning supposed to be happening their
data and they're they're supposed to do
it with their unlimited plan so
therefore if you have sperm right now
you have unlimited make sure you use
that shit up because yeah it's gonna be
problem and then on top of that I heard
that they fuckin data speech is real
slow
so why up they're trying to talk about
everybody else um I should go real fast
bitch and I have no issues let's freakin
kiss my nice tanned light-skinned ass
cuz I'm done with that they can I would
never go back this friend seriously they
have the worst customer service do you
know that I got everything with my
number transfer worked out with Verizon
in my first call you know that was nice
do you know that they gave me on kureta
courtesy credit do you know that okay so
I don't know how he's gonna be with me
and Verizon in the next six months but
let me tell you something needs to let
these last two weeks bitch's been real
blissful I just want to say like I'd
have I want to issue out some candy
today ass like happy motherfucking I
lean on the nurse so yes I love my phone
I love horizon I love you guys
I am back I got so much shit to talk
about someone should has happened in the
time that I have not been doing videos
so I definitely won't be able to express
that but I also want to say if you guys
have any comments not comments enjoy put
any video ideas because I'm want you
guys to be a little more involved
