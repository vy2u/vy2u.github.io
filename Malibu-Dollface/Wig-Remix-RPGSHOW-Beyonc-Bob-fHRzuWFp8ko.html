that I was going to cut this wig into a
bob and I did it I know that I said that
I would do a sped up video of me
actually doing it but y'all I did this
is like at 3:00 in the morning when
there was nobody up and I was just up
vibing the music and I grabbed the wig
and I was like you know what I just
humming shopping
it's just I'm gonna go in and do it I
really didn't know I said I wanted it
like the other one but not so much body
and you know bump right here I just
wanted it straight like this
I actually was inspired to do my hair
like this based on there's a picture of
Beyonce when she first cut her hair off
and then I guess she didn't like it so
they gave her one of these wigs but it
was hardly more lighter in here but I
like the asymmetry of what her hair
looked like um so yeah this is the same
wig from RPG show I just cut it into a
nice asymmetrical bob I'm not gonna turn
around cuz I'm sure the back looks a
mess cuz I didn't clean it up because I
just don't really somebody's alarm is
cuttin up outside but um I didn't really
clean it up like I wanted to just
because I'm planning on wearing this
like that but I just wanted to throw
something on and do something a little
bit different I do like the color now
the color is perfect now it was I don't
know if it was this that was the color I
mean the color the problem or what I
don't know maybe the cut I don't know
what it was but it looks much better and
if it was more of me with this color now
versus when it had the rest of the ombre
on it so I don't know sometimes a cut
can't make a difference in a color so
maybe that was that's what it was I
don't really I'm not sure but um it was
very easy it was very simple it was very
straight to the point
um I love it and you know it's not
really much more I can say about it but
I do really love it it's different from
what I'm used to
um let's see I did it at like 2:00 in
the morning
it was real quick I think I cut it I was
watching Jim and Holograms and I think
it was a two-part episode and by the
time they thirty minutes apiece there
was on Netflix so no commercials so
let's define that it took me less than
an hour listen I were to cut it I
tweaked it though for like another three
hours to make sure that it was really
what I wanted this week was very thick
in the back so when I could because I
cut it like I put it in a ponytail
as you can see I put it in a ponytail I
pulled the ponytail down to right about
here and then I cut it so that gave me
because you know remember when you cut
something you can always take away but
you cannot put back
so always cut and whenever I cut either
a weave or anything I always cut longer
and then work my way up versus cutting
up where I want it and then you go curl
it and then my bump would have been up
here which would it look like Towanda's
from the brush it's y'all know she got
that one wig that looks a hot-ass mess
like miss Braxton misto Wanda knew so
yeah and the mouth so I don't I don't I
didn't want it like that so I definitely
made sure I was gonna cut it right
because I did like this it is a lace wig
it is the lace um I left before last
week so it stops right here and then
this is my hair and my edges right here
just to leave them on just think of it a
little more make it look a little more
in a row side um but yeah it's cool it's
it's it's breezy this is really very
summertime sadness
hence my Lana Del Rey shirt um very you
know like for the summer this would be
very perfect I don't plar it probably
plan on wearing this wig ever again um
probably just take Richards name I'm
gonna keep it though cuz I really do
like it uh just a thought so I'm not
just like you know I just wanted to feel
what a bob felt like you know I run to
the stove and be a new bitch real quick
but yeah it was cool though I really do
like it
a lot of people were saying that they
liked me with the black Bob which was
cool I like the black bomb I did not
love it because it was very big and this
is more
for me because it has more of a flat you
guys know I like big hair
trust me y'all watch my videos y'all
know I like some big-ass hair however I
do not like um just big short hair
because then it starts to make me feel
like a mom or um I'm doing it I like a
show or something you know saying like
that's like Abby Lee Miller with that
hair it wasn't horrible but it was cute
so a lot of people were saying and like
you need to keep the bob you need to
keep the bob so this was look kind of
like alternative I was gonna dye it
black but I didn't feel like doing all
that cuz that's a lot of work and I'm
not moved about anything right now so
I'm gonna keep it this color but it is a
nice color it is pretty um they did a
really good job once I cut the ends off
and as you can see the ends are dry so
this is what I had a problem with once
this was taken off then it was no
problem so that's the kind of thing that
I really do like about it is sometimes
man happens with wigs sometimes you get
dry ones or ones that are not dyed
correctly or sometimes the bleach will
strip the hair and then it just becomes
like this so when you try to wear it
it's not Q but as you can see I have cut
all of that off and it turned out to be
really nice so this is from RPG show
I'll put the link to the actual wig you
know beforehand before it was cut um so
yeah I'll put the link in case you want
to try this and you like I just want to
be the wig to try out to see how it will
look if I cut it or you can do this with
any way you do this with a synthetic wig
like if you have old wigs try to revamp
them like if you just have something
about them that you don't necessarily
like cut them and or sometimes add
tracks in them you know it can make a
world of a difference and you loving it
and you hatin it you know it's it's
either/or but I thought I really loved
this when it complements my skin tone I
don't feel like I'm running together no
more like you know is just cuz I felt
like I told y'all for like a hood chick
named Shante and that was not cute
so yeah that's that's kind of it for
this for you I'm just rambling
at this point but semi-god tell me what
you guys think at the bottom and tell me
what other styles you guys want me to
try cuz I'm like I'm on this thing now
like I want to just try whole bunch of
different stuff I don't want to look a
man but I do want to try a lot of
different stuff so don't get too crazy
with it but I do want to know your
opinion so leave your comments at the
bottom and that would talk to you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
