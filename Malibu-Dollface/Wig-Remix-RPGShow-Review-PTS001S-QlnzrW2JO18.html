on this wig as you can see and this wig
is from
RPG show you guys know a review for them
earlier well late last year and I had
reviewed the Khloe Kardashian inspired
wig which was cool but member I thought
you liked it was a little dry at the
ends a little thing really didn't like
it too much um but they took me this one
and just an FYI this wig did not come
nearly close to this this was not the
style this had I'll go through
everything um but this is wig number P
pts 0 0 1 - s it is in the color jet
black the hair length was 20 inches it
was silky it was a cap one the cap
construction was a glueless cap the lace
color was a light brown now when I got
it um they said it was 20 inches I
personally didn't think it was 20 inches
you know you guys know I'm I know when
something is a little off and to me it
just seems like he just wasn't at 20
inches so um what I ended up doing was I
decided that I was gonna cut it and
cutting it what allowed me to actually
kind of see try something different as
far as like the length and all that I
was concerned but it also gave me the
ability to UM just to get because it was
thin at the end like it was 20 inches
but it wasn't like a false 1 inches it
was just like 20 inches and it was like
short like I don't know so what I did
was I tried to play around with it they
had it was supposed to be bangs that's
originally what it was it was bangs that
bangs forever right here they were
pre-cut it was a layer that was pre-cut
but that was a so what ended up
happening was I went and cut it and kept
cutting and kept cutting and before I
knew it I just didn't like the way the
bangs look the wig would look more like
an emo wig at that particular point so I
was like I don't like this so just
playing around with it I turned the wig
all the way around backwards
and before I knew it I just noticed
because I cut so much that ended up
doing this so I was like hmm
maybe I should just make it into a bob
and just put it on backwards since the
back has lace too and then just used the
lace from that and really changed this
negative into a positive
pretty much so what I did was I started
cutting from in the back because this
was where the bangs would have been and
I just started cutting up and at an
angle and that's it and I eventually
started to get this and when I started
to get this I was like I really do like
this it reminds me of kind of taraji P
Hinton uh when she used to wear her like
this but before I did it though I will
say that it was full like the top of the
wig is really really full so what I had
to do was because it was big like you
know Wendy Williams wears her Bob's and
they just be like eight bundles a hair
tie big it was like that so what I had
to do was I had to take a hot comb
pressing calling whatever you want to
call it and basically go through the
entire thing to make sure I got the bulk
of it out so that this wasn't be
wouldn't be as thick as this part cuz I
like the fullness in here I just didn't
really too much care for it being all at
the top so after I did that it started
to lay down pulled it a little bit
behind my hairline through some edge
control here in the front for my my
signature swoop that I love oh so much
and it looks like or what I really did
was I chopped my my youth my other you
part into a bob because this is a sack
same style but if it's shorter it has an
angle on the bottom but yeah I cut
everything myself as you can see it's
short back here and it's bumped so that
it can have this nice bob effect um but
I like it though is it's not me I will
say that it's not really me but it's
something that is different and I did
want to try something different so why
not you know you have a leg don't really
like it it's not really the best but you
want to try something different this is
actually like really perfect so I really
do like it the hair texture is really
soft is really nice
it gave me no issues with cutting I have
to attribute a lot of the way that this
looks to the hair because the hair is
that
nice it's really really nice so I do
like this um a lot and it's really soft
it moves it has a lot of movement to it
which always is a plus especially when
you have short hair the short hair
doesn't move then it's not it's not good
but this is some actually nice hair it
isn't specified what type of hair it is
it's just as hairs texture silky so I
don't really know what type of hair this
would be I don't know if this hair is
processed I'm not sure if it's virgin
I'm not really sure I'm almost certain
this process so because it's really
straight and most of the time natural
virgin hair does not come this straight
so and have this much body to it
initially straight out the package or
however you get it so yeah I cut it cuz
I posted a picture on Instagram and
everybody was like can you please do a
video but I was like people don't know
like this is the same week I didn't post
any pictures of what it looked like when
I first got it but when you look up the
number of the wig on the site then
you'll be able to pretty much tell what
it looked like before so it was classic
the issue that I had when I first got it
was that the way the bangs were cut was
the issue the pre cut later they gave me
was really low and really wide so when I
cut it it started to give me this to
deveined appearance that I was not too
fond of so I ended up having to go with
something a little bit different but I
do like this though you guys like it's
not like I said it's not who I am it's
not me you know I like everything to go
past my butt and longer however this is
a nice alternative it's pretty it's soft
it's easy as hell to put on the only
thing I don't like and it has nothing to
do with the company it's me it's because
I did put it on backwards the band from
the back is right here so I wouldn't
really wear this outside person I know
some tricks that would I know some dudes
that would because it's a nice unit if
like I don't care what nobody say but
yeah it's just because I got like the
actual band like the adjustable strap is
right here so because the way I parted
it wasn't wearing any of the lace was it
was just where the band was so other
than that that's the only kind of thing
I don't like but whatever it is what it
is it is a nice unit it's really nice
my other wig that I have the Chloe one
I think I'm gonna cut that one into this
exact same style but probably just a
little bit shredder not with this just
like an asymmetrical straight so if you
guys want to see that thumbs this video
up or put at the bottom that you want to
see that cuz I probably like do a like a
entire spider video of me cutting is
styling it and all of that from top to
bottom cuz that was just really sitting
with no purpose at this particular point
because I don't love it but maybe if I
cut some of the ombre off and kind of
put an angle on it I might actually like
it so maybe uh so yeah I hope you guys
enjoyed this thank you to our PG show
for this beautiful hair and thank you to
you guys on Instagram I love this hair
so much I was shocked that people were
like people were texting me like keep
the bob if it's you keep it and I'm just
like no because I already got some 30
inch hair from D Hair Boutique that I am
a ready to rock so yeah but it was fun
though and I do like it so until next
time I'll talk to you guys and later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
