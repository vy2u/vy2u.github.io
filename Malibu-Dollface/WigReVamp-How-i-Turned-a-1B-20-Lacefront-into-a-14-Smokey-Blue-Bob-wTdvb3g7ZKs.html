about this particular look so this week
was the week that RPG show had sent and
it was 20 inches I went ahead and if
you're going to do a middle part make
sure you kind of put your middle part
where you want it to be I put mine to
the side part because I had just get a
middle part so the first thing you want
to do is go ahead and cut the way you
don't want to have to bleach and die and
waste all this money on hair that you're
just going to cut off so I went ahead
into it a scissor cut you could do this
with the Clippers as well but I just did
this just because it's easier for me
just doesn't get hair everywhere so as
you can see now I pretty much have a bob
uneven ball but I have a bottom so again
I cut this longer than I intended to
wear it just because of the simple fact
that I was going to go ahead and bleach
it as you guys will see further in the
video if you want to keep it this list
and my advice to you which is B to make
sure that you just even it all out so
when you have clippers these are my
conner ones nothing there were like 20
dollars you can take them and just go
ahead and cut the hair and this way you
can end up with a very even cut without
having to take the time out to make sure
your cutting is right and all that
anybody to do this as you can see is
very very very very blunt and this is a
look that I was going for so I just went
ahead and got a rough estimate of how
long it would be and if this wasn't
perfect just because of the simple fact
that I knew I was going to cut it
shorter I just wanted to kind of get a
ballpark I guess you could say figure of
how short it was going to be ended up
being shorter than what I intended it to
be which was fine by me because my last
bob was around this length that this one
is once I finish this particular side so
as you can see we just go through and
try to even it up as much as possible
this is a very very good way for those
who are just not very well in
understanding the over directing the
under directing you know the own based
off base of how you actually cut prepare
so this is actually a great alternative
very inexpensive what I do this with
regular Clippers depending on if you can
use them or not I use these just be
I felt like a lot of people will
understand it it's just there's no
guards you just go in and even it out as
much as you can just be careful because
it's very easy to keep cutting every
time you see that it's not even and then
before you know it you're going to end
up with a like that Remy Mullins which
for me is too short you know that Kelly
Rowland words is blunt and it's really
short it's on the side of your cheek
it's tired you know it's higher than
your jawline that's not cute to me so
here and you also gotta remember that
it's still hair up underneath and you
want all of this to be the same same
length once you go ahead which like I
like to do with my blunt I like to go
ahead and press the bottoms a little bit
with the flat iron so they kind of curve
in just ever so slightly and then you're
going to kind of get longer pieces in
the in the beginning so have you seen in
my actual review that I different is you
can see that my hair was a little bit
longer up underneath and that's only
because the way that I actually bumped
it and as you can see I noticed that one
side was still longer than the other one
so you just keep you keep going at it in
two things starts to be because it's
very easy for your eyes to be tricked to
believe that it's all one length until
you actually really just sit back and
look at it and always look at it from
the back because if you look at it from
the front chances are you even the
Front's out very well but it probably
has a slight dip in the back where it'll
dip down and come back up on the side so
just keep that in mind now this is where
you know it got real okay so at this
particular point I'm like are M good I
know what I want I'm good I'm keeping in
the side part I had did I plan to wear
this hair in essential State and then at
the last moment I decided to change it
so here what I'm doing is I decided
before I did it was I was going to fly
on it the reason why I did this is
because I wanted to make sure that it
was as straight as possible before I
actually had to cut it again so if after
I bleached it I didn't want to end up in
a situation where I'm like okay I
couldn't too sure because I thought it
was you know long enough but I didn't
flatten it right so I just went through
and I didn't do everything but as you
can see here I'm kind of
um taking out extra little pieces that I
didn't get once before like there's a
longer piece right there that I didn't
get which you thought was going and
living so you just go ahead I flatten it
out and then I just took um put the
Clippers and then cut it off but yeah
you could do this is I usually just do
the top of it just so that I can make
sure that everything is flat and it's
straight if I needed to be I don't
really go through the whole head around
cuz I don't want to I'm already about to
put bleach on it so I don't want to end
up where my hair is over-processed is
bleaches is crazy so as you can see just
go ahead and take it and cut it and
you're good
and this is for people who are just
starting out and you don't really know
so much about even the fundamentals of
actually cutting you can use this as a
bit of a guideline and it does make you
no matter what color you use if you
don't use this much blue you to paint
you to orange you know you say 1b you go
jet black midnight blue whatever what it
will do is to make sure entire just
everything you do so much neater when
you get them end off man it just makes
it look like you you are the best
phallus in the workout
as you can see here I'm just go ahead
and everything off like I wanted to be
so everything is to family length it is
everything you need to be perfect
because this is one of those files
unless you curl it that everybody's
going to know if it ain't even or not
which is source ever and I didn't use
any hairspray on this particular look I
just use my Flatiron spray which is a
conditioning spray as well so what it
does is it helps the hair before I even
put bleach on it what it's going to do
is it's going to make sure that the hair
is is lustrous as possible so it can
retain some moisture once I go in this
is what I did I like to use an electric
pressing column when I do my unit just
because I can control the heat a little
bit better and it just gives me a very
very flat install so here I'm just go
ahead I'm going back it's going to take
a while so here is where I started the
bleaching process and of course you know
I've decided before everything but you
guys get the debates the basic gist of
this and this is what I was using some
different bleach so I should have used
the bleach which I'm using now which is
the quiz blue by L'Oreal which I love
suggest but this particular bleach um it
took a minute to list and I was going
for more originally it was going to be
like a really dark dark blue so I didn't
want to leave it on too long and then in
the midst of all of this are just pretty
much a selection for money so that's why
the variants of blonde changed
throughout this look as I was kind of
doing it as I went and then you're going
to go ahead and saturate the entire head
this particular unit is a lace front and
not a full
wigs or the tracks in the back you have
to make sure that you saturate those
tracks that are close to that cap with
bleach because if you don't and you plan
on wearing this in a style that is not
let you say a darker color when the wind
blows or you do scratch your head or you
you part of the further away it will be
very noticeable for keep that in mind
and here I think this was probably the
second application so now I'm going from
the roots at this point and I'm just
making sure that everything is saturated
but it was just because of the simple
fact that I just didn't like the
consistency that I made this bleach so
much the actual color wasn't the turnout
wasn't what I wanted it to be but I'll
be doing this again it's different color
so you'll see what I was going for
originally although I did love the
outcome of this I did because it wasn't
super bright it was toned down but it
was it was still something I really like
here this is what I decided to do at
this particular when I said I'm going to
put like eight different tones in his
hair so I wanna make sure that some
areas are darker and hence why like in
the middle of this there's no bleach and
then on the sides there's less lesion at
the top there's more so it was going to
give like a reverse ombre look is what
we're going to eventually have
regenerative evidence on but I just
didn't want it to be all one solid tone
and I just didn't want to end up in a
situation where I hated the color like
it was one solid color that I just hate
it and then I'll have to go back and do
different levels of color like use
here's the thing if you dye the hair
whatever it is and you put levels in it
as you list it once you put the color or
the color will deposit in these levels
um
automatically so if you use if some
parts are lighter blue and in some parts
are darker blue and you put a regular
blue on it they're going to
automatically be those colors so this is
the result of what I got which I was
completely fine with and I said okay but
you can see in the middle it's like a
613 in or outskirts it's more like a
honey blonde so I decided to use this
L'Oreal color from I got it from Target
it was like five - was it I think with
buy to get a $5 gift card so I brought
four I ended up with a $10 gift card
which is Jenna ended up using it for
something else so just follow directions
it's very easy just have to let it fit
in deposit with hair like this and not
especially when I'm doing wigs weirdo
always do I like to leave this color oil
for at least overnight to me it seems
like the color is richer it stays a
little bit better it has a longer
lasting power in my personal opinion if
you don't want to do that that's
completely up to you it has a time limit
on the actual application the thing
about this particular hair color is
after a while it does start stopped
working so it does have a time limit on
it but I find if you just leave the hair
saturated the hair follicles will start
to suck up the color a little bit more
and it will starts to look a little bit
richer so that's why
and you noted at the end out I'll bring
it up again while my hair looks so much
richer in certain areas than it does
others so here is just a daunting task
of going to each strand each section I
use all four boxes even though this is
just about but I did want to just
saturate all of the hair the great thing
about this is because it is a lace front
wig is that I was able to not have to
worry about every little intricate piece
of trying to make sure I didn't get any
on the legs
I only had to worry about that just
towards the
you
you
I found in the mountains where is the
mountains out of the side maybe you
trying if I'm the problem but if you
don't talk when I came talking I love
you crazy why would you involved in
Coleman in miracle
like a revolt
we'll let the job I called your husband
then we go out with alumina did you are
silent
I stopped smiling tonight baby and
trying to find the problem but if you
don't talk then I can solve them all of
your friends alive will you involve them
going in circles
please saturate all of the you see like
here I just opened another bottle and
you're just going to put as much as you
can accentuate every lash strength
because this is a color and a color it's
going to have a lot of color variance
you want to make sure that you are
generous in every section just so that
you don't end up with any patchiness
because like I told you once before it
is a Bob and I use for boxes but I use
for a box is to ensure that I wouldn't
have any spot enos or patchiness or
anything like that
this is rocket towards the front and
pretty much this is all the same I'm
doing I'm just going through each
section I didn't record the washing
process just because you guys see me do
it a million times if you watch me bleed
not sentence the same difference and I
use regular shampoo and conditioner will
actually use the conditioner that they
gave me in the box and then I use just
regular shampoo I didn't use purple
shampoo because I didn't want my hair to
end up being like crazy lavender so I
just kept it very basic and make sure it
stays this smoky blue color sometimes as
we use other stuff for like blonde hair
and your hair's not blond you'll end up
with thinning which I didn't want to do
and this is what I got when all was said
and done so as far as the cutting goes I
cut it a little bit shorter and then I
went ahead and slide ironed it bumped it
put it on and I wore like three or four
days like this and then this was me
after I had washed it again and redid it
so if you guys are interested I'll put
the link to the review below I hope this
helps you is very simple especially for
those who are starting out is very
simple try it let me know how it turned
out and I will catch you guys in my next
one
