a times in a row hi
this was fun like this feels like new
girls like hey you guys know I never do
ponytails like ever so this was really
fun okay so this just let you know how
long I've had this hair um this hair is
from a company called Wiggins hair
before we even get there these are all
the sleeves that came with the hair that
had Wiggins hair on them as you guys can
see okay so they sent me to 22 and to 24
and they also sent me a 22 inch 360
front to your yard so what ended up
happening was I wanted to try to test
out because a lot of times when I do
reviews you guys asked me about color
how does it take color so this hair did
not come this color actually colored
this myself with some good old 40
volumes in some good old BW bleach out
and surprisingly this is the exciting
thing about this I want to get to it did
not break all it did not get hard
what kind of did because I did it twice
um but after a good deep condition it
was cool its and as you can see I put
heat to it and it also held a crook I've
been out all day so yeah this if I'm a
little shiny
that's why thanks okay so so what I
decided to do was I took my bundles and
I went ahead and while they were still
within their bundle parts I don't were
doing this like around like October 19th
or something like that or not October
night it was something with a nine in it
and I bleached the bottoms and it ended
up coming out like this so it was this
was the first time that I did it and
then what I did was I went ahead and
took it I went ahead and constructed my
wig and once I constructed the wig I
went ahead and released it to make sure
that my roots just so that I'm
down so that everything matched when I
did the bleaching I did them again
separately in the bundle so I went ahead
and did that went ahead and constructed
the wig put the 360 on and then because
my 360 didn't have any color on it once
I went back I always ensured me that my
360 would only be um a little bit darker
than the hair and then the ends of this
would have what came out lighter than
the rest of the hair so I have two tones
of blonde that my hair is right now so
it's like a brownish blondish honey
blonde color so as far as my bundles go
shockingly the when I first got the hair
let me say this the hair was not the
softest that's the kind of thing it was
quite rough which I was kind of like oh
I feel about this it's a little rough on
splitting up but I will say that after I
bleached it twice and then deep
condition it for about I want to say I
left the condition over about half a day
I'm not sure how long it was like how I
was in the middle of doing Halloween
stuff when this took place um so when I
was in the midst of doing this I left it
on for a little bit longer than I
usually would what I did was I took in
order to apply this puppy I used my guys
to be glued I went ahead and leach the
nods on it I made sure that I plucked it
because it was very very bar delicious
when I got it okay was nothing close to
pre plucked when I received it once I
received it I did it but I did it a
little bit differently this time I
bleached it but I left it on for I think
30 minutes this time I don't know it was
taking pretty quick to bleach so I was
just kind of like cool so I'm gonna have
it got to be glued down so these nothing
that you see is mine every single thing
that you see on my head right now is a
wig none of this is mine these sideburns
aren't mines this isn't mine or what I
do what mine did the ponytail I wrapped
it it's a piece um I use me some of
these
I use because I noticed that you know if
you like little romance big break your
hair or whatever but I've noticed since
I've started wearing bundles that hair
elastics those are really cute for you
girls who are going to the gym but when
you got what I got three and a half
bundles in my head to make this ponytail
work and it would have been higher had I
been a so lazy I had to use some of
these in order to get them to hold
because it's a lot of hair and it's not
like your regular hair when you slick it
and then you slick it into a ponytail
and then it's nice and cool no over my
bobby pin came out Oh No good yes so
when I slipped it I had to make sure I
wrap the pista hair around it so it
would match and then I went ahead I'm
kind of mad at myself because I have
some braids right now that are really
not working for none of the cells that
I'm doing because they're a little too
big so um unfortunately my hair looks a
little bit bigger than I would have
liked with this look but I feel like one
of these Chanel's you know boom I feel
like ariana grande that's not good I
wouldn't feel like although judging for
my intro my my love JLo that's what my
makeup is really soft right now I don't
know if y'all can tell us off to this
but in the lightest is pretty damn song
um that was Jalen was my intro that my
intro my inspiration I wanted a JLo
ponytail and I wanted it to be like here
I just didn't have the the one because
where my 360 is in the back yeah that
blue they're not old back there but I
only put one layer back there and then I
have put a bandana on it for it's a kind
of um cure and then this one goes all
the way behind my ear so it's glued from
behind my ear all the way to the back of
my neck the only thing is it didn't stay
when I pulled it it came loose and I
don't want to put on more glue just
because it's ridiculous so what I'm
going to do is I have another wig that I
have that is a bun that I will be doing
and then I will do some little
reinforcements on that but let's see
because I can take this puppy and make
me a nice little bun if I wanted to
bam bam thank you ma'am
oh girl Oh No yeah this is my pasta
fight now I feel like I'm going to
boarding school and now I'm back at the
club um but Wiccans hair if I had to
give them you guys know I'd like to do
my rating system if I had to give them a
grade I would give them a eight and a
half only because when I got to here it
was hard and then I didn't like the fact
that my frontal was not pre plucked when
I got it like I kinda want a little bit
of help you know I like to not have to
do so much work and um that was really
is though but this is the first hair
from aliexpress that I bleached this
much where it didn't completely just go
to hell on me like it actually has some
luster left into it it actually you know
doesn't feel dry
it doesn't feel nasty or anything like
that
um and I do really enjoy my frontal and
I also like the fact that this is a I
think this is a thirteen so that doesn't
my boy yeah 13 by 4 because it's a lot
of partying space and it kind of sex me
because I do have a ponytail that you
can't see how much partying space I have
but just judging by what I got on and
and that whole thing yeah it's a lot cuz
usually my tracks would stop they start
like right here we're pretty much pretty
bad is which I got from forever 21 cuz
they're on Instagram were asking me
where I got it from it's actually like
my next situation but I was like this
would be really cute for your hair and
then this lace top um and then these
jeans I got from forever 21 you guys
know I love my fur jackets from eBay if
you ain't know um so yeah hey Higgins
Wiggins hair definitely get out eight
and a half for me I just want to work on
the I wish there was a little more
luxurious when I received it but overall
it's held up and I've been wearing this
puppy okay
so if you guys are interested check the
links below if you guys have any
questions about what I have on or
anything like that put them below cuz
i'll answer
um and yeah I would can show in come on
and I forget my braids redone sweating a
little bit smaller to this my dear girl
isn't cute but I like it I just don't
love it cuz I know I can do better okay
