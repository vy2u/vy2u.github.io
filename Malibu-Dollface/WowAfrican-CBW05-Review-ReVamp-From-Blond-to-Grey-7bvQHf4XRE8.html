for my last gray wig slash hair in the
series and this is my wig from a wild
African this week I will say didn't come
out as I imagined it I would thought it
was gonna come out it really didn't but
you know sometimes things don't go as
planned mother - did so that's fine and
I do kind of like how it now it's
growing on me how it came out so why not
so I'll get to the specs of this wig
Burstein well right now again just from
my opinion you guys know I've reviewed
lifted hair and wigs for them for quite
some time now I think this is for my
fourth review for them the item number
is cvw 0-5 the hair color is pound sign
227 8/6 1/3 the hair length is 12 inches
and it's a cap 7 with a 4 inch of 4
inches of lace in the front so just off
when I looked I was looking at wigs and
I wanted to try something a little bit
different and the picture of the wake of
this particular wig was of some actress
I don't know who she is but some actress
or whatever and she had like this tousle
she looked like she needed to do her
hair she the picture that I used was
really bad because she looked like she
got socked on a red carpet
but anyway so I looked at the wig or
whatever I liked because it was like
blonde and I knew that I wanted to do a
great bob with this particular color for
this series and everything else was
really are just very black okay
everything was just everything every
color was black or dark brown so I knew
I wasn't gonna be able to achieve this
color with any of that and I didn't want
to have to lift anything so I picked the
wig but then they informed me after I
picked the wig that this particular wig
was only available for when I was told
it was only available with
four inches of party space in the front
and the rest of in the back will only be
tracks or whatever with the tracks so I
was just kind of like mmm all right I'll
just kind of make it work so when I got
it it was all blonde and I was kind of
figure out like what are you gonna do
with this like how are you gonna make
this what you thought your vision or
what your vision is so what I did was I
brought me some soft black which I keep
on hand because my natural hair is like
a brown color and I don't like that
color so I used to just dye my hair
jet-black so I had some one hand or
whatever so I like another box just in
case but I did the roots dark I did that
the roots of black first and then I took
that um the true steel color which
should be ready though I took that color
and I put it in again I put it in a
ziploc bag and I just let it sit and I
let it sit for like two or three days
and when I rinsed it this is the color
that it came out and yeah actually
really like it and the hair actually is
of quality which I love it's not you
know it's not brassy or any of that it
actually curled correctly it's actually
still very pretty and I live so you know
why not
so yeah the hair actually the actual
texture of the hair is a really great
still nothing came out um it's not
actually a bob so because I didn't it
wasn't shedding or anything and I didn't
want a good it because you know I don't
want to have hair everywhere so the back
is still here no now if I would have cut
it and I cut it into a bob this is
pretty what it look like worth it this
is what it would have looked like like
this it would have been
what'd it look like there and you guys
know I have so many bad videos now I
think I'm on like five different spot
videos this moment so I was just kind of
like I don't really want to do that so
this is kind of like a nice little rash
and then I just curl up the front to get
it out of my face but yeah this is like
a nice little wrap look and then like
again I just dyed the roots where I
thought they should be a little bit
darker in order for them to blend but
then I was gonna say and there was a
witness was with her picture but it just
had dark roots and it was a full lace
and I'm just like all this work to do it
myself
but it's awful it's good I still love
them over there um yeah this particular
wig is available right now I think
they're having a bob special got some
Rob's wishes so I think they have a Dory
on ABAB just Bob the Beyonce Bob's I
think all of those are actually born
still right now so if you're interested
make sure you're going to walk in my
farm hey dawn over here look you know
look at all the weights and stuff like
that this way actually has I think three
pound no it has poor palms because
there's two right here one in the middle
and it's a combing back because it's not
full lace I do it when it or not full
length and it has an adjustable strap as
well when a not full lace it seems like
the cap construction is a little bit
better due to simple fact that you can
kind of find your footing to get it into
your braces sometimes with the with a
full lace wigs they have a tendency to
slip around not all the time but
sometimes they are loosely brute so yeah
but let me know what you guys think of
this particular one this is the last
gray in my storm gray series so yeah so
yeah I'm stop rambling now and I will
talk to you guys later
hope you enjoyed this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
