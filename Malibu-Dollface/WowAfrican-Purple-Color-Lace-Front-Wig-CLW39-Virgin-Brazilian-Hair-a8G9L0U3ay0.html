off by saying that I might sound a
little congested and that's because I am
trying to get over this head coat that I
got cuz my dumb butt slip a fan on W
anyway um that and I got a fresh beehive
today so things are a little tight but
anyway I want to come and give you guys
my review for this purple wig yes I said
purple cuz you guys know I always say no
purple hair no orange hair I've went
against what I'm usually say to try to
do something a little out the box and I
kind of say I gotta like it I kinda
kinda like so this wig is from while I
pretend and before I go any further if
you use cold doll 15 you can get $15 off
all lace wigs on their site so every
little bit counts so let's get to the
specs of this hair this is actually a
purple ombré so the top is a 1b and the
bottom is a nice purple color here's the
color of clothes and I can say it's very
very nice I actually really like this
purple is one of those colors kind of
like how it is with me and red
it goes great with my skin tone I just
tend not to wear it a lot cause it's
tend to be like a very ghetto color the
length of this is 16 inches they it says
the density is 1/3 this is a cap number
7 which is a glueless lace front cap and
what that means is there's only lace
from where my part stops to our part
begins in all this back here is tracks
none of this is it's not for lace or if
I wanted to like kind of Park this all
the way like our camp lace the lace that
on this particular wig I didn't notice a
difference and I don't know if they
changed it or
tripping but the lace seems to be a
little more buttery which is always a
good thing on when it comes to your lace
wigs it seems to want to lay down much
flatter it seems like it was much softer
than my previous wig they never bother
me like they're not like a cheap place
where every itchin not like that but you
can definitely tell the difference in
the lace like sometimes the lace it just
it I don't know it's weird you have to
really live with it to see what I mean I
do like the lace that is on here um the
party space is all that you see which is
here that's all the part in space I have
if I part let me just show you if I part
here there are trucks right there
there are tracks so we can't do this and
we shall not do that is a lace front
it's not a lace wig and I think a lot of
you guys sometimes get them confused
there is a difference a lace front is
only in the front a lace wig is the
entire wig so yeah but the biggest
hang-up with this wig that I will have
to say is the density um this is all the
hair I will pull forward this is how it
looks all pull forward and as you can
see it is 16 inches but it's not very
very full at all which works for a
natural look um I will say because this
color is so pretty I would have
definitely like to see it armed up with
a little more density because I feel
like a little more density what it
definitely took this there but it's kind
of just here for me um I like it out
it's great for photos it's brave for
video um it's just a little too thin for
my everyday life you know like this is
not really much hair when I'm trying to
you know be everything I need a little
bit more weight and I need a little bit
more length I think if I would have this
wig and like a 24 inch um in the density
they said it's 130 but I feel like this
is 100 percent density honestly I'll
give you guys a look from the back okay
like this now imagine if it was a whole
bunch of hair that came too
here it would be really cute but it's
not and it's really not the limp that
bothers me at all because I actually
like this
um how it is I just wish it was much
fuller than it actually is but hey
everything is not gonna be great but by
all means am I saying it's a bad wig
no a lot of you guys I always say this a
lot of you guys are not into the very
thick look um this is just a little too
thin for my personal liking but some of
you guys actually might really enjoy
this it flows wonderfully and I didn't
put anything in it so the lustre that
you guys are seeing on camera is the
natural luster the way came with so yeah
um I enjoyed this I just don't think
that is my judge I think it made me some
of y'all judge but it's not Margit but
again a lot of you guys suggested that I
do do purple hair um so there you go
people purple it is um the partying the
part that you see got you guys see is
the part that came with it I did not
heart it I did not I didn't come with a
middle part it wasn't all the way back
it came with the side part so I just
left it in because as you can see right
here it all goes in one and all of this
goes back because again it is only a
lace-front it is not a full lace wig
check out while african i put all of the
info for this wig below or again use
that code if you guys are buying any
lace wigs on their site which is doll 15
$15 off and let me know if you guys like
this color and i'm now that i did the
purple people i did the purple i'm
thinking about one ahead and just go
ahead and do the orange so people can
leave me alone and see where that goes
so yeah i will catch you guys in the
next one
