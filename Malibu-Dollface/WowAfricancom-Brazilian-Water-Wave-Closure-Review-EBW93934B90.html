hey Lisa look at the big is so yeah okay
so this hair that I'm rocking that is so
big and little pushes it's from Wow
African and you guys know work about
African throughout the years and this
review Akana is no different
um the only difference is this is not
wig because I usually get wigs from them
this is some nice wefted hair that I
made into it we're gonna get to the
specs of this good old puppy and I'm
gonna tell you what I do like and what I
don't like and why is to give me very
Kelly Rowland you know really liked this
a whole lot so yeah let me get the specs
of it and all the regular stuff we do
here okay so before I get started I'm
gonna let you guys know if you use cold
Malibu you will get $10 off any order
from their site so this particular head
that I'm rocking is their waterway which
I don't understand why is called the
waterway because this look a lot like
deep waves to me but okay I have a three
point five point for middle part closure
that is matching line texture so this
hair is Brazilian hair and it is in a
natural black so it is kind of an off
black color but it just kind of comes
off like black and to me it looks like a
one but it says off black but to me
personally the hair looks like a one so
my closure is 16 inches and then I have
a twenty of twenty two and two twenty
fours bottom bundles both are 24 so if I
do this you'll see that they are true 24
but because the Harmony the hair is long
and it's springy then it comes off um
like it of course it's shorter so my
experience with this hair um I've had
more negatives than I've had positives
like you
I see this it's like this this is kind
of the issue that I've been running into
where I can just pull this that's not
okay
like I don't know why my hair is doing
this but yeah it's I keep getting this
nice amount of shedding and I'm not
really happy with that because the hair
is so beautiful I just don't like the
fact that my hair sheds when I pull it
it comes out in yeah it's like it's not
all the hair but it's starting sections
or I guess certain bumbles that are
coming out and because my hair is big I
did not cut them I folded them so we
can't blame this on the cutting of the
web's um I don't know
why my hair shedding like this but it's
shedding more than I would like and I'm
sure anybody else would like pretty much
um the hairstyle I got from Kelly
Rowland because I thought it would be
really cute and after I did Co wash it
and put some crow cream back in it and
you guys keep asking me what crow cream
Iman using I'm using the Garnier Fructis
um I think it's like cause something
curls it comes in like a round container
and it's green I forgot one of those
eyford I've had this stuff always buy it
in like two at a time from our curly
hair but that's anything that I really
buy or dream curls works too which is
nothing by frizzies that will do the
same thing if I can't find one I usually
get the other it just really depends um
but my hair is really full and is really
big so when I washed it it wasn't crazy
like I didn't get crazy amounts of it
because I do my bundles uh I'll put the
hair in first and then I'll wash it
after I put it or make it into a wig
because I find that it's easier for me
to kind of go through them and figure
out um how it's gonna lay and how it's
gonna look sometimes on my straight hair
I always do it individually but with
this hair and most of my curly hair I
tend to do it like that I find it easier
I'm just have it all in one but I did
notice that my bottom two bundles were
shedding a little bit more than I would
have liked so I don't know why they're
doing that
I don't know what the issue is can see
they curl back up when I
the crow cream in any drawing they grow
back up but they're shedding like crazy
and I don't like that and it's such a
pretty style but I'm sure if I run my
fingers to it I'm gonna get a big clump
of hair and I'm not happy about that at
all so yeah whatever can I don't know
like I don't want to say I hate it
because I'm loving the hell out of the
style I think it's beautiful I think
that it's great the hair is when I do
this it's very but it's just I already
know what's going to happen is after a
while this is gonna turn into probably a
big mess and I'm gonna be upset it's
really fluffy is very curly everything
on my crows own uniform like nothing
does not not match um it's big it's
beautiful but it sheds like crazy and
I'm just not here for the shedding like
you guys know nobody wants a whole bunch
of hair okay I've been having this hair
on to today specifically I've been
having this hair on since like 8 a.m.
and this is the amount of hair that I've
gotten so far in yeah this is a lot for
one day now imagine week this is going
to be a problem and I don't know why
it's doing that a lot of you guys have
suggested also your webs the thing about
when you buy here is that still in your
web should be an option it shouldn't be
something that you have to do because
everybody doesn't want to sit up there
and run this stuff across your webs
you know I'm saying and then let them
dry overnight it's like you get some
hair you want to put it in right then
and there
it's that's not something that you would
want to do still in your web should be
an option it shouldn't be your only
option so I don't know I'm really mod
the jury's hung for this hair because as
beautiful as it is the downside of it is
the dam shutting like it might be oh
they didn't come out okay
what I good on that part but yeah the
amount of shedding is it's kind of crazy
to me but hey maybe after a while it'll
calm down a little bit um I don't know
I've only wear this hair for a couple
weeks now so I don't
and I haven't worried like a week
straight it's been like I wore like
three times out of the week you know so
I tend to not really run my fingers
through it I tend to kind of fluff it
like such and then go about my day so
hmm
I'm still 50/50 on this one I love the
hair I love the luster of the hair I
love the color I love the middle part I
love the style I love all of that but I
just hate the damn shedding so why
African let's do something about the
shaving because this is kind of like a
problem but with that aside I will say I
do like the hair no means do I love it
because I know what he's gonna do later
on down the line you know so no no I'm
gonna give this a D you know I'm saying
I that's about as good as I'm not an F
because if it was an F it wouldn't look
this poppin you know like doctor use
this on your Instagram when you're like
oh here inspirations but yeah yeah I
don't know I don't know I'll let you
guys know how this one holds up for me
cuz so far and I told y'all the amount
of in it I got today I don't like
it you know but let's see if I'm missing
anything I'll post all their deals for
other stuff down below but I'm a little
saddened by this because I've just seen
the hair texture and I'm so excited
put it in and then drama started so let
me know what you guys think below and
I'll give you guys an update on this
particular hair because I know a lot of
you guys are looking for some nice curly
hair and we'll go from there okay all
the information for this hair if you
shall be interested it will be
definitely posted below and again I use
our frizz ease drink curls or garnish
roost east forgot what it's called it's
in around bottle for to each curls back
after you wash them so that they can
stay nice and uniform like this and they
don't fall out alright</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
