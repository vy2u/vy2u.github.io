review this AB AB that I got on actually
you know it's not a bob is a wrap
um it's a full wrap and you guys know a
couple of months ago I tried this look
and it just did not turn out like this
and I was kind of sad about it but I'm
actually happy because I like this much
better um this week was actually a
Sierra inspired wig as when Sierra was
wearing like the ombre to dark roots and
then a blonde and she had the middle
part and I didn't hate it but I did
definitely didn't love it but I don't
think I'm gonna try and give because
sometimes in pictures people say that I
was like Sierra because of my jaw line
so I was like well maybe it'll work on
me I don't know but no it did not work
so I'll give you guys the specs on this
wig so you guys can umm if you like it
you can do it mine this wig did not come
great but I'll get into that a little
bit later if you use cold doll 15 you
can get $15 off all last week so every
little bit helps
so I you know don't forget that okay so
the code for this wig the item number is
CLW 26 it is a 4 or 14 and a 6 13 and
it's the hair length is 12 inches wig
density in this wig is 130 which I can't
I can feel that it's thicker then like a
hundred percent density it has a little
more fullness to it than what I'm used
to
which is good cap number 4 which is
glueless and some a couple who asks me
what's the difference between glueless
and like a like a non bluest cap
the difference is are non glueless caps
are made to be bonded down so they don't
come with combs in them this has three
combs in it so that I don't have to bind
it down I have it behind my hairline but
I have some baby hair out right here
because I see people like
tried to do like they do with no hair
out in the front and that if that's what
you do that's what you do but it just
looks like a wig because it's it just
goes from being super thick at the root
to your forehead and it's no gradiation
and to make it look a little bit
believable but I mean that's how people
want to wear the wigs that's how they
were doing cool fine whatever but it's
just not for me and I'll post all their
information their Instagram and all the
other stuff that they got going on at
the bottom um this week I've had for
like a month
I had this wig for I think since like
Valentine's they are probably before
that I think I had this wig um it took
me a week to actually rent it because I
really forgot about it not like I didn't
want it but I had so many other things
going on and so much other hair that I
was coloring at the time that I was like
oh you got forgot about my wrap so um
this actually turned out to be way
better than what I thought it was gonna
be
I use my fanciful um color which is a
temporary color rinse for people like if
you if you want right here and you're
trying to get it this would be the best
thing because you don't have to lift the
hair this year was a very pill blonde
when I received it so it gave me a great
base to work with to make it this color
and I just pretty much I just took it
and took the top off and dumped it in a
ziplock bag and just let it sit and I
made sure that all the color was
distributed evenly so that it will all
end up being the same color this is not
the same color that I usually get this
one it's called silver lining and the
other one that I usually got when I have
to when I have my gray hair which should
be somewhere over here when I had that
hair it was a different color on the
swatch this color is lighter but it came
out darker and on the swatch that one is
darker but it came out like so maybe
because I left it in for so long because
I did a closure too in a bowl for this
color so I was just like hmm I don't I
don't know but I like it you know so
this one is cost over lining from
fanciful and it's most great this week
I've been wearing my friend had a great
party so you know I had to go show out
I'm still waiting for the business by
the way um but yeah I wore this wig I
loved it it went with my actual outfit
because I were all grey
with like a gray jacket it was
everything it matched this color my
other color was like uh like a lavender
gray this one is like great gray like
it's all the way gray
so yeah this hair is nice to the texture
of it is of course it's silky but it's
not too silky it's enough and I probably
has to do with the fact that it was
lifted so it's not shiny um which I like
it hasn't given me any problems and in
fact that it's this short is great
because it's easier for me to do it
without having to be all down my back
but you guys know I am a long-haired
person and I was like I don't I don't
like nothing up under 24 inches because
it's just what am I gonna do with that
but this is actually really nice like
I've you know you gotta try things
before you actually say it and I'm so
used to having Bob if I ever have a
style like this is usually because I
have a bob but because this is not a bob
this is just a full wrap it's cute and I
think because of the color it makes it
it makes me like it even more because of
that
but yeah so let me know what you guys
like um let me know if you fill in is
color you fill in mine was a vine Bob
are you feeling down wrap let me know
and I will catch all in the next one I
feel like storm especially with this
good old Jeremy Scott jacket on I feel
like I'm gonna be like you know anyway
I'll talk to you guys in the next one
bahah and remember used all 15 to get
$15 off bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
