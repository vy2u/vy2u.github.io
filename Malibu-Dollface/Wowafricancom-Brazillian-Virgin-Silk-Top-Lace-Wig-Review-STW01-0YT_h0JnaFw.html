beautiful wig that I'm wearing and I
have to say I'm really feeling this and
I add more tracks I'll get to that but I
don't have to add any here for summer so
to move okay so this actually comes from
a company called Wow African and while
African they actually hit me up via
Facebook and asked me to review for them
and told me to pretty much pick any
comfort I mean any wig that I want so I
was like okay um this is it this is a
Brazilian version a silk top wig so it's
actually a silk top I love the fact that
is silky because you guys know my last
one was a light yaki it was the one that
was similar to like like this one was a
light yaki or whatever so I've always
wanted like a silky texture wig like
that one and you guys know out on what I
want to do and it's still kicking so I'm
gonna do the same with this one I'm
gonna wear it periodically throughout
videos to kind of see how it's holding
up or whatever would have some nice
beautiful luster and I only put like
some flat iron sprain and when I flat
ironed it but that was a pretty much it
it is 22 inches is a true 22 it's not
that fake 22 is you know it's really 22
inches I won't hear them like fresh
tilapia um let's see what else this is
Brazilian I did say that that it was a
Brazilian or whatever but um it says
that they have been they have if you buy
um if your order is $89 or more you get
free shipping which is great because
nobody likes a place just pay for
shipping like not sure he'll don't um
the next thing is you get $10 off when
you use cold w8n of $89 or more so you
can actually get this wig um well not
this particular one I don't know how
much this one cost but this of the
number of this week is an ST w01 and
it's a natural color
so it's like a brown like I said it's
like a - you know it's like a black it
oh you can only really tell that it's
brown like directly in the Sun but from
here it pretty looks play um it's 22
inches it's a Brazilian virgin here that
can be dyed to any color I like the fact
that they specified that it can be dyed
to any color because a lot of times when
I get these wigs I'm scared to put any
color on them even darker color because
I'm afraid that it won't take oh I'm
afraid that if I try to lift it it's
just gonna burn the evening burn the
hair Alvar and the lace out I'm just
thinking of any of the the worst things
possible that could happen to the wig I
think that's so I really just leave them
as they are it also has two combs like
right here and then it had it has
adjustable straps in the back and then
it has I still have the lace on lines
but it still has the lace to the name so
if you wanted to bond this down you
really calm but also those promotions go
up to $35 off so I'll post all of the
colds down below I'm so far so good I
will say it hasn't given me like any
tangles or whatever so I'm gonna try my
sling test and that's when I sling my
hair to see if it comes back and it like
actually falls back like it's supposed
to you know hair is always posed to do
this okay it works okay so yeah this is
good if hair does that it's good because
that means that it's gonna fall right
back into place like it's supposed to
you know when your hair does that I mean
if it is some good hair because I'm
gonna tell you when hair is not of
quality what happens when you do do this
it usually gets stuck like this and it
doesn't want to move but obviously you
see that I didn't do that and again this
is fresh off the box so it is you know
pretty still good but I can tell by the
texture of it and how it's acting right
now it's not gonna give me any further
issues or whatever and you have to take
care of your units and stuff like that
if it's not up yet there will be a video
of me actually putting this wig on
straight out of this box never seen the
wig before besides on the side never
touched it took it off the box put it on
style
today so therefore you'll get a from top
to bottom tutorial on how I style my
wigs when I get them on the box so that
people can understand that you know a
way company only constructs the wig it's
up to you to style it to make it yours
and make it fit your face and frame your
face and make it feel like it's yours
and it's one it doesn't feel like yeah
you got that from Sally's Beauty Supply
and it was $14.99 on clearance you know
I'm saying it looks like wow you got a
really your hair is really nice it's not
your wig is really nice or your leave is
really nice is your wig is away it's a
wig yes it's this is a wig you know you
want that type of reaction from people
you don't want people like you don't
want that so yeah I love it um as yet to
give me any issues but I'm definitely
gonna be wearing this in and out if you
don't see me in it just ask me about it
in the comments and I'll let you know it
really didn't work out like I thought it
was but for the most part yeah um I will
be definitely in and out of this one
because I did want to silt a more of a
silkier texture with that same silk top
the silk top looks really nice it looks
really natural
um I thought it was gonna be like it was
like it's like a grayish esque color but
when I put it very close to my scalp and
blend so I don't know but I did put like
a little concealer just just to kind of
give me like more of a yellowish tint
not so drab looking um but yeah the it
looks very natural you can part it
anywhere at the top within the 4x4 area
so let's see you see
you know so it looks very natural it
doesn't have a moon shaped hairline even
if I didn't pull us on my hair out you
still could probably bomb this one down
I just don't do that because I don't
think that it ever looks natural no
matter how good they they try to make
the hair lines I still don't think that
they look natural you know what I'm
saying unless you pull out some of yours
to kind of make it look natural but yeah
if you have any questions like I said
always let me know and yeah I think that
just to go back in on the Shivering real
quick I think the shipment was about a
week so yeah that's good from coming
from China that's really quick and it
came dear Jill so yeah I'll talk to you
guys later and thank you over there ad
Wow African for this beautiful unit
because I definitely will put this to
the test</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
