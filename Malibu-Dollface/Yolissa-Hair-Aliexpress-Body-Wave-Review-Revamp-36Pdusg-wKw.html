I like swings easy like this so this her
is from I believe the name is yo Lisa y
yo ru yo Lisa hair is two S's mm-hmm Oh
from aliexpress and this was their body
weight texture and as you can see there
is no waviness going on with this
straight I just want to do this real
quick go home bondo bondo
but the reason I want to do that is
because I want to show you guys how like
I just like because it's so blunt at the
ends how nice and like it just has too
much body and loosely you know and could
always get this especially when you cut
some hair sometimes to get real dry on
you okay so my original bundles um and
length of my bundles before I cut them
into a witness in another this is a good
16 minutes def another 16 18 20 22 and
24 and my frontal is a 14-inch frontal
so that's why my hair stops right here
because I'm like is 14
so yeah this originally was their body
weight texture like I said once before
and I went ahead and straighten it and I
went ahead and cut it and it I will say
this I like it better and straighter
than I do everybody right here okay now
by no means am i standing here is bad
that's body wave here but body weight
for me is just very boring and the issue
that I have with a lot of companies now
is that does all I ever want to send his
body way so it's really up to me to
revamp the hair somehow some way and
this style is always very easy is always
very simple to do and easy to wear I
don't have to really worry too much
about my edges and there's a reason why
the middle part as opposed to a side
part or it all pulled back or whatever
but I'll get to that in a second so I'm
gonna get a close-up for you guys to see
this is the original color of the hair
and in our tree become color treat the
hair or anything like this this is the
original color this hair has been Co
washed white and it has been washed or
done so we're going to get clowned so
this is what I did this is a nice little
it's just a blunt cut just because I
feel like if it makes more sense it's
more wearable for the everyday person
this is very cute if you want to add
like accessories and stuff so if you
want to add like some cute little cat
ears or something like this I'll keep
these on for watch the video but you
know just something like this where you
know you want to do something that's
cute and simple which you don't want to
be substances great for the summer like
I said in my other videos the summer is
upon us so therefore you want something
that's cute got a little length on it
you can go ahead and throw it over your
shoulder but you are not gonna die when
it wasn't always on your back so this
length is very cute
for the average Joe myself included I
really do like this now like I mentioned
there's a reason why I have a middle
part I don't know if it's just me I
don't know if it's just there frontals
but the problem does not fit my hairline
like at all like if no a no go okay and
as a hell no no unfortunately I was not
to do too much with it besides the
middle part because I'm able to you know
we have a middle part you can cheat it
as far forward as you can't because you
can't see anything right here but I
think my front soul yeah it's like right
here and my edges are like right here so
there's a big gap and it's not cute so I
won't show it but I will just just take
my word for it it's not attractive
lovage is this particular frontal that
they send me it is a 13 by 4 but I don't
know what the difference is between this
one and all the other ones because this
is the first time in a long time where a
person just simply just didn't fit me at
all so I don't know what that's
necessarily about the strand test for
the coloring was fine I didn't get any
like weird colors or anything and lift
it it does seem like this here when you
have to lift it above twice if you're
trying to go for like a blondish 6 13
ish color if you're trying to go
anywhere you might have to do a more
than one so I would suggest you do
something that is very very you treat
the mess out of this here when it comes
to moisture and hydrating after you do
it the first time but I don't think that
you will run into any problems after you
already toned it and then put whatever
color over it off you just wear it in
that natural state now as far as this
right this color goes as in you know
it's all one color because sometimes you
get bubbles and your bundles be like two
different colors they're all the same
color
no no just that I have with this there
was a lot and there probably still is a
lot of gray hair in this hair they put a
lot of fillers in his hair and that for
you guys who don't understand what
Chile's are fillers are when they put
the hair to get chipping in food you
ever get my Yahoo eat hot dogs you know
it's filled with every despite the whole
kitchen sink so when they put the hair
in it to make it to save other hair they
look like a gray in a like and grades
and throughout sometimes I've seen
blonde hairs in some of our divergent
hair virgin hair that I've gotten and
with a lot and I mean a lot in this hair
and that's one of the hangs up you'll be
so here let's calm down on the fillers
because
I haven't pick a lot of those out and it
took me way more time to get to this
review because I don't have time to just
sit there and be plucking when I got
other stuff that I'm trying to do as
well so this took a lot to pluck on them
Gray's out the way so I got most of them
out I'm sure there's still some in here
but I will say other than that those are
the only two main issues that I've had
with this hair is the fact that my
frontal doesn't fit and it was a lot of
gray hairs everything else no problems
the bleaching no problems tangling I
have been very good as you can see it is
very silky it is very straight so I
don't have those issues make sure you
don't go to those things you have to
make sure that you get a good slider I
would recommend the Remington flat iron
which is I believe the two inch ones no
that one is like four inches that's
because it's big it covers a lot of area
at you know at a time but it also makes
sure that your hair is very very like
ten straight I like the the plates that
are on that plan and then I just use my
beyond the by beyond his own flat iron
spray and any good flexible hairspray
you mix those two and flower through
your hair you should be okay again like
I said once before I'm going to do a
tutorial on that for those who don't get
it but that's the reason why I don't
have those issues of my hair being where
it wants to not do this okay pretty much
so yeah so you'll leave the hair for
those two hang-ups who wants to bring
y'all down from an a probably down to
like of being Kula be - I'll be like
because those grannies honey that's for
that's at the average Joe ain't bout to
be all day that is a lot of damn
work and I thought I was going on with
chalk frontals maybe it's my hairline I
don't know but it didn't fit me at all
so overall I do like this egg like I
said I like to tear more better straight
than I do on body weight and that could
have been a reason why they put so many
graves in it because the body waves we
hit would entail but when it's straight
you can always tell but other than that
my
I said it was cool so a b-minus is it's
okay for me you know I can suffice
although I would like to try there
straight hair to see if there's a
difference between their body waving
they're straight I'm just curious
because this is popping like this
nothing gave me give me no issue I was
out getting it and filling it and my
hair has been good all day okay like it
moves it has a lot of body to it all
that and I had no problem most hair can
do that most the time to get stuck and
then you can't run your fingers to it
after you do that bone look at God so I
hope you guys enjoyed this guy's have
any questions hit me on Instagram all of
my social media stuff should be right
here and I will catch all and my next
one and just a background my top is
forever 21 and the ears are presenting
ones as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
