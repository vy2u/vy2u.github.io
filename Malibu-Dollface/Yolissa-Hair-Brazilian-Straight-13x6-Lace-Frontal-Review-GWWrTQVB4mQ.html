you guys have officially did that
so obviously this look is inspired by
the one and only alia and I had to go
ahead at 5:07 in the morning to give
y'all some old-school Shazam's and gems
where's my brush for those who are gonna
ask if this song get my intro is
Timbaland Magoo's sub jumps to boogie oh
okay I am rocking if it's 5:00 in the
morning my eyes are bloodshot I'm tired
a headache
alright but listen I got a 13 about six
frontal girlfriend check that part all
the way to the back though yes this is
what I'm talking about when y'all send
out frontals y'all even send out
frontals like this because I'm able to
do styles like such because the frontal
is so large and in charge okay now my
bundles okay I went ahead and cut them I
had did them very quickly so this I has
way less hold on cuz this jacket you
cannot tell so on this side there's a
lot of layering all of this on this side
with the knit side is pretty much
nothing because I knew for a fact that
this you see it's only layers right here
because I knew for a fact that I was
just gonna go ahead and do this with it
so if our curl did then it would have a
nice little situation to it but it would
have been a lot so this I thought I put
a lot and then it fell obviously because
it has all of this going on and the hair
is long - I wanted to cut it a little
bit shorter but I didn't want to
before I reviewed it so that you can see
how long it actually was now I believe
that this is 24 inches and this is four
bundles of 24 so I'm not mad at the so
that's what we're getting as far as the
length goes now I will say this is some
very very soft soft hair your lisa hair
I don't know what it is I don't know
what the difference is I don't know
which I did different this time than
before
but this got a nice flow to it and this
is after a wash this is after cut this
is after a party or two and it actually
flows and it moves like such and it was
extremely soft it's not as soft because
I put a lot of hair products in it when
I first received it like just fresh out
the back it was so soft and he had that
nice little move that walk warmed shake
it shake it so it had that in it and
then as far as my frontal wind it was
easy to bleach it was the Illinois I
feel like one of those girls whoa one of
the 90s girls who used to do the hype
here magazines and they used to be like
this is what I use in my hair it was
doing it she was like oh but this is
this bomb okay bomb okay this I got my
fault
like that girl keep it like you see that
the shine that shame is that I love love
love love love this especially for this
whenever you do a one in a million that
arrow type of look or just sleek hair in
general you want to definitely make sure
that you do it with hair that is super
duper able to mold it so that it can
stay cuz it legit like how flat this is
it legit look like I went and got my
we've done you know and none of this is
mine none of none of none of this is
mine all of this is the frontal all that
frontal all of this is their hair so it
ain't really much mo to say other than
you'll leave the hair I give y'all a 10
out of 10 cuz I didn't have no issues
with this whatsoever let's check that
girl check you see that you see how you
see how that does that and it's cascades
its cascade
okay that's what you want to do so when
you at the party girl and you see your
ex you'd be like what had happened hold
on let's break it this way so I can give
you an exam I did a hair flip in a
minute you know you see oh oh he's here
with his new girlfriend
okay I'm gonna dance on the dance floor
this way like that yeah I'm saying like
that's what you do so um as far as color
goes it does take color very what I was
actually gonna bleach this hair to like
a nice pole um color but y'all know I
just I changed my mind
just because I'm top done I got a lot of
color coming it's a lot of 6:13 on the
way y'all just sayin
but yeah you Lisa here thank you guys
for being very patient with me like I
said about my other cut the other
company I just did um yeah I've just
been like super duper down in the dumps
lately like guys you already can tell
I've been very absent from social media
but you know things happen but I want to
say that they have been very patient
with me and I love this hair like legit
I would suggest is hair over any other
straight hair that I've suggested to you
before so for all the y'all keep asking
me the same damn question over and over
and over again would you suggest this
hair over this hair yes I really like
your lease in here I like their customer
service I really like their hair I don't
believe I've had any issue with their
hair but I'll have to go back and look
this big listen girl they can't get
around but I really do like how easy
this is and this crunch will go like I
love I love this you know if you can pop
see I like my parts to go all the way
back here this is where you know it
feels real you know when when your part
stops right here ain't nobody believe in
it you don't even believe that girl
let's just keep sure you don't believe
that okay girl it don't look real you're
not telling me you're not selling it
okay the facade is up girl it's a lace
front
so 24 for 24 of I believe this is the
Brazilian straight I will you probably
seen what it wasn't a beginning of this
and I have a 20 inch 13 by 6 that 2 inch
difference I mean it makes more of a
difference 13 by 6 lace frontal and I
didn't have any color issues with my
lace or whatsoever would this one which
I was very happy with so I can't say I'm
very happy I will be giving this wig
away in an Instagram giveaway because I
have a lot hair like it already
