a couple of weeks I've been dying to do
a subject video because I've haven't had
a lot to say because of things that have
been going on not necessarily with me
because I'm good I'm just with people
around me I've seen a lot of things that
I find to be very unfortunate for them
but yeah so the reason why I wanted to
come and do this is because this subject
I posted on Instagram and I said
something on the lines of some of y'all
want to be loved so bad you'll take
anything that resembles it and the
reason why I made this statement is
because there are people that I know who
have told me stories and things of that
nature about wanting to be in
relationships and wanting somebody to
love them and all this you know all of
what you want in your life but the
common denominator and the problem that
I find with this is that they don't love
themselves so how exactly do you find
love if you just you don't know what it
looked like I can't find my car if I
never knew what it looked like it's just
a sea of cars so I'm gonna pick whatever
I like not what's best for me you know
I'm saying that's that's there is a
difference between that and I don't
think that people understand that it's
like tomato and tomato it's similar but
not really um I think the problem here
now and this is not just for the I'm
speaking towards the gay community but
this is just apply to everybody I think
you guys issues and you guys problems is
you guys have deep more deep-rooted
issues that you are not willing to admit
or share or take on I think it's easier
to go from one to another to figure out
why that one didn't work you know rather
Tim whether it's you where there's a
situation whether it's both of you guys
I think whenever you get out of
relationship it's time for you to take a
reflection test and look at yourself and
see what could have done to make the
situation better sometimes there's
nothing that you could have done
sometimes it's everything that you could
have done it depends on you as an
individual but you have to be
responsible for the the repercussions of
the decisions that you make when it
comes down to being with somebody
because a lot of you guys run from
one thing to another it's the same story
but it's just a different leading man
you know he didn't abuse me he didn't
talk down to me he didn't make me feel
like then you go to this dude and
of course the first couple of months
he's a good guy dog then ten
months later he's Chucky so it
really depends on you and you have to
learn each relationship should be a
learning lesson and it should give you
the ability to see what you do not want
to see what you do not want to end up
like who you don't want to end up with
and if you continue to sit there and let
it be what it is and let this person
take advantage of you disrespect you
talk about you
like the last one did then what was the
point of leaving him if you were gonna
do with this one the penis has changed
but the abuse in the disrespect is the
same so you didn't come up at anyway you
know but it comes with self-worth and
you have to see yourself for better I
wanna be loved I got this I got my stuff
together I got a car I got a house I got
this I got that but nobody trying to get
at me like that nobody you know hey I
hear a lot of complaints
um amongst people whether it's Facebook
Twitter Instagram about how they have
themselves all together but nobody wants
to mess with them nine times out of ten
there's a reason it doesn't it it
doesn't always have to be about success
for somebody to want to be with you you
can have a shitty attitude a nasty
attitude the way you carry yourself
could be just full of and they
don't like that so it's not always about
what you do and you don't have it's
about the person that you really are
because unbeknownst to a lot of you guys
y'all date based on numbers y'all date
based on how many Instagram followers
this person has how many Twitter
followers this person has how popular
they are how much money is in their bank
account when there are other people who
do not base who they like and who they
love or eventually will love or none of
that they based it on your personality
are you a nice person
are you a respectful person are you a
great person are you a bitch are you a
bitter ho are you a messy Queen they
based some people like myself will based
on who you are on the things that you do
online online is like a job interview
especially when you're in a really
it's like a job interview and I could go
to somebody to Instagram and see how
messy they are with somebody else and do
you think that they heated me up in my
inbox is talking about some I would love
to be your best friend and I see you
talking about some friends and what they
used to be best friends is this and this
is that near do you think that I would
put myself in that position to even
attempt to be friends with you hell no
no but you don't even get you don't even
get a golden ticket to get to the gates
sorry
so if a man or a woman sees you in all
of your glory and who you are as an
individual on social media then I think
that you need to learn as an individual
and as a person that the way that you
carry yourself on social media and just
in general and life will determine if
you have a significant other or not it
will you know I think the issue and the
problem with people is that they don't
love their self in there they're waiting
for validation for the next person to
say that they love them when half the
when was the last time you told yourself
that you loved yourself that you were
enough that you were a person that
deserved this you know is you sitting
back letting somebody disrespect you
talk to you crazy just don't care about
your well being an individual as an
individual if they can do it to you then
anybody else can do it to you you know
like if you go off and mess with ten
guys in one night and they all know then
you're gonna be known as a whole when
you're known as a whole you don't love
yourself ain't nobody gonna wife you
ain't nobody gonna love you and I'm not
gonna wanna be with you you know it's
all in how you are as an individual but
I see people with jump in relationships
just because they want a warm body next
to them and that's not how life works
that's not how you should be living your
life that is not something that you
should want for yourself you should want
that and way more if love is a beautiful
thing when it comes from love you know
you but you can't know love unless you
really experienced it how heartedly and
a lot of you guys have it I don't know
what that is I don't know what that true
meaning of that word is you get with
somebody on Tuesday and you you
ain't with me talking about him
on Instagram on Thursday like I'm saying
that's not love but you guys loved each
other for 48 hours that was true love
that was the love of your life because
you met him on Instagram he had his
shirt off and he was getting all these
thirsty bitches to say that he was fine
that's not love dear that's they don't
work I don't I don't know what flaw
universe you live in to believe that
that's what that is but that's not what
it is that's lust that's what that is
and you're lusting over a person who
really does not want you you know so
y'all have to learn that a person that
really cares about you and really gives
a about you will never do anything
purposefully to hurt you if they send
them back with people on
Instagram like people in real
life talking to you talking down to you
saying you this don't understand who you
are don't want to get a chance to know
who you are to give you a chance to be
that person that they say that they love
oh so much that's not the person for you
because that's not what love is
that's the impatient child who wants
their way and if that's what you want
then by all means do what the you
feel but that's not what you want but
you claim it I want this and I want that
but you continue to fall for the same
exact people over and over and over
again then that means that you have to
work on yourself because you're the one
who's in this repetitive stage you can't
blame him for the things that you
continue to do because you're the type
of person that continues to put up with
this person but I know there is a person
that I do not want to with if I
don't like your ways whether it be your
nose your eyes your face your we your
personality or the person that you are
as a whole then I'm not gonna with
you when I see characteristics of people
that I no longer with and pnew
people then you no longer again get
through the pearly gates I'm sorry you
just you didn't make the quota sorry it
is what it is and that could be not the
best way when it comes down to people
but usually my instincts in my gut is
right I'll give a person a chance when I
feel like they're misunderstood or they
just need a moment but when it's a
person I know for a fact - it's not
about I'm not going to set up here
and waste my time on you bitch
no no we're not gonna do that and you
shouldn't either a lot of y'all wasting
your time it's it and meaningless
relationships they don't mean nothing
because you don't know how to love learn
to love yourself be true before you try
to learn to love anybody else okay cuz
learning to love yourself will teach you
the real meaning of love nobody can ever
say anything wrong to you nobody can say
anything wrong about you
you
who the you are that's gonna lease
in my next video because I got a lot to
say about this Carmen Carrera
but I'll get to that in a second um but
yeah back to the subject at hand
y'all have to learn to love yourself and
stop settling okay just because you want
somebody to love you and you want it now
that's gonna lead to a lot of problems
okay now and I don't think that's what
you wanted and if that is what you want
like I said but all means do it
but stop complaining about it on
your page and how am i don't
rock with you and how lawyer you are as
an individual and how I'm always there
for shot up because you were the stupid
ass bitch who said I feel like this
person used you for everything that she
was not worse so therefore when you let
somebody use you up to there's nothing
left that's not love that's stupidity
and you let it happen so if you want to
be a dumbass
stupid bitch for somebody who doesn't
even matter to you and it's gonna go to
the next person when all is said and
done then you do that but you shut the
 up and you do that in your own time
don't put that on social media
because we do not want to hear that
 learn and grow a pair of balls
grab them and walk the
 on whether it's in stilettos
sneakers or slippers we should do what
the you got to do but shut the
up about it cuz I'm quite tired of
hearing all of it if you don't want that
person in your life get the away
from them get rid of them and live your
life it's yours you can do what the
you want to do okay stop being a little
baby and when it just cry about what's
going on in the world tell nobody like
me bitch you don't like yourself how the
 am I supposed to like you and on
that note bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
