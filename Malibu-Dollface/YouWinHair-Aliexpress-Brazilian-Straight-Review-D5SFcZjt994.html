want to get a close okay so Randy I'm
Sam okay I wish I would have made it a
little higher to my house which is
actually one of my favorite styles like
ever because very simple is very to the
point and it's just some basic layers as
I'll be explosive as you can see its
layer central all up and through here
because I'm ignant like that I wanted to
do something that was very kind of to
the point and very easy the silhouette
is pretty it's a you know to the point
something that we all know and love
so this hair is from a company called
you win hair so let me show that I'm
saying this right the spelling is
correct is yeah while you WI in hair and
it's from aliexpress I am wearing two
bumble I mean four bundles of I believe
it was 24 inch and I cut them into yeah
after a trim these are probably 22
inches and then I have 18 inch frontal
as well from them which I actually like
a lot it's not my favorite frontal but
it's definitely not a bad frontal I
think just coming off of the the which
was a 13 by 6 by the way the other one
I'm just like kind of like on
the departing space is cute but not my
favorite okay so my experience with this
hair thus far since I've had it I've
been able to color it which I did to
make John here at the ball what's going
on but I had put a little color at the
bottom and actually could color very
well and I was going to put a color over
it and then that's when I kind of have
the Epiphany to go ahead and cut it so
that's what I did and then also I'm just
gonna put all bachelors in it so I don't
really think this revolves I already
think this involves a lot of color it's
better when it's like a classic look as
far as the shedding goes I don't get any
shedding from this particular hair
however I did use the hot glue gun
method on this hair so that could
actually be another reason why I have an
experience in anything you guys know I
always tell you when I do reviews I
always tell you guys to get three
opinions take mine someone else's and
someone else is one of those people are
a little free need to be a customer okay
this is this was sent to review so my
hair may be very different from someone
else's but make sure you keep that in
mind so to the actual the cutting of
this hair was very simple it comes like
a dream the from the frontal itself is
very cool and it did not come pick it
didn't come pre plus but it didn't come
with the boxy hairline neither it was
very non gender at the hairline but I
went ahead and plucked it just a little
bit more so that I can make sure that if
there was to my liking it was to my my
head shape now what I did was I made an
accident when I put my guys to be glued
on accidently like put all my edges in
so I look a little bald right here which
is not me bald it is because I can you
like flick everything and usually I
leave the little curve here out because
none of my fronts will ever give me that
but I put it in so that's what the cat's
going on right here girl
but the frontal to me is really cool I
don't I don't hate it is it's a basic
frontal with nothing that's special
about it is nothing that's out of box
you know out of the park about it
it's a Brussels
come as far as the bumbles oh when it
comes to just functioning everyday I
like them this is a very cute style to
wear
I wouldn't necessarily wear this hair I
wouldn't put I wouldn't lift it there no
nothing type of for because I feel like
once it got I think I listed to around
before anything after that I feel like
you're going to encounter very very very
very very bad shading issues as far as
my hair goals as you guys can see these
curls were today's curls these are not
you know usually I can leave them in for
a long period of time and then they'll
be cool this hair requires consistent
curling so it will not hold a curl as
long as I was likely to own for about a
couple of hours if you got on the night
of the town when you get home your hair
should still be like this or something
close to it unless you put a lot of
hairspray and a lot of fifty rods what
if you just curling it I didn't put any
flexi rods in his hair eyelid Lee curled
it let it sit then comb them out so may
I haven't tried it for long-term wear
when you actually kind of just do it but
see wise and then see what happens in
May possibly but for me I just haven't I
didn't want to go down that road I
wanted a more of a lighter softer look
and sometimes I finalist let's survive I
get more av2 uniform to look and then
sometimes it's like very vertical but
for the most part this is fine for
Aliexpress brand I will say that this
hair is actually some of the better hair
that I've gotten on the spectrum of
Aliexpress especially now because I'm
kind of like slowing down with Alex
fresca they have all these new rules in
it you're certain here on earth so um I
do like like this here I do not by any
means love it like this is a wig that
I'll snatch up and wear for a weekend
because I'm just going back and forth
and I know for a fact that I'm gonna be
taking it on and off but I already think
for like photos or anything glamorous I
will use his hair for because to me I
don't really to my deluxe err was kind
of like almost
none which kind of sucks oh my hair
doesn't look as luxurious as I would
like it and you guys know I like a good
shine and mines
but I wasn't I didn't get that with this
which sucks
so overall I'll get this here a 1
through 10 I'll give this probably I
would say a solid 8 ok a solid 8 but
again it just it could just be me
because of the fact that it's nothing
spectacular I'm just kind of like on vs.
I wanted to be excited about it but it's
cool it will do it's satisfactory if we
were in school you will get like um a
see if whether C is C EE
our CES I think it's like satisfactory
isn't as I don't know what he was I
forgot I don't know where I got a lot of
fu you so hey so if you guys are
interested in this here make sure you
guys hit up you win hair on one Alex
first I'll put those links below if you
guys have any questions about the tear
of any swords please let me know I will
be more than happy to ask the company
corresponding communi I like to give you
guys kind of you know the closed caption
with the company what it was still alone
you know sometimes I have very good
experiences with my Aliexpress brands
and especially corresponding back and
forth and there is a language barrier so
I did that but I'm just kind of like but
overall I would give to here a solid

a long shot and you are somebody who's
