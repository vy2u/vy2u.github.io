just the other day some girl decided
some stylist yeah um she decided she
wanted to have an opinion about me and
the things that I'm doing and my money
flow cuz she was just so concerned about
what somebody else money was talking
about and she had on a halter top but
okay so stay in your lane and get your
point okay so what happened was I had
posted you guys know I believe it was
last week I posted the video on how I
use the gossipy glue to install my wigs
which I use the same method on this week
so that it just does not move gee
obviously follow me okay and she decided
to have an opinion and say you're giving
away her exact quote was you're giving
away techniques that Tokyo Styles
charges for so I was like or was it it
was the techniques or secrets another
word seeker was thrown around a whole
lot and I'm like well what a quick
Google search even if you search the
product you're gonna see a whole bunch
of people in a whole bunch of videos in
reference to using that to keep their
wigs down so it's not like it's not a
pentagon secret what I accidentally used
it and fell asleep with it
I got used it I think like back no.9 or
oh eight or whatever I used it to put my
hair in a bun one time and I just I just
I'm like it's jail and I put a scarf on
when I got the next one I had to like
peel the scarf off so that's why I can I
well this if it works for us bargaining
will work for lace but I was wearing
like glueless for the longest and just
if recently I'm like I kind of want to
get back in to see with it what bezel
will not move at all so she made this
big argument about well you're giving
away stylist secrets and I'm like bitch
they're not secrets though I don't I
don't think people understand that being
a youtuber we know a lot a lot of us
have been to school a lot of us have not
been to school it just depends on it um
and what what's happening right now is
that a lot of you guys are watching us
and trying to DIY your weave your wigs
your up you know all is instead of
paying a stylist so I know a lot of
hairstyle
to look down upon youtubers and say that
they are not real stylist which is
completely fine there's a lot of
stylists who are real stylist that I
don't consider real stylists if you give
my drift
um having a license doesn't necessarily
make you the greatest artist in the
world okay the young lady that had the
opinion about what I was doing pretty
much was saying you're giving away these
secrets for free and you're gonna be
broke in two years which I thought was
really weird because I don't I don't
share my chase account information with
her so she would know exactly what my
savings check-ins are in between would
actually look like but okay this girl
has a YouTube channel her own I happened
to check it I had to look her up cause
it was very hard to find her she just
wasn't readily available when you typed
in two letters like me but okay so the
thing that I was she had channel 1516
videos ranging between in a month about
900 to 1000 views didn't check the
comments cool but my whole thing is this
Giuseppe Zanotti can give a about
what Louboutin is doing because they're
both making money and their own lanes
and I have a lot of friends who are
stylist and a lot of my friends who are
stylist will call me and ask me what is
this when a 360 start popping up a lot
of my stylist friends were calling me
like yo have you tried one you know a
lot of my clients were asking about it I
would like to know because I know a lot
of them arm on Aliexpress which is from
understanding where they got really
popping is where a lot of people were
seeing them and wanting to get them from
so that's fine and the thing is I no
other stylist I think Tokyo Styles is
great they're internet personalities who
do celebrities I've been contracted and
axed to do hair for a lot of celebrities
and I always say no and the reason why I
say no is because I want to do other
things and you guys know from the story
time that I did hair is not I don't want
to be a hair stylist you know you can be
good at a lot of different things in
life but some people may only know you
for one or two things that you do out of
15 so it's something that I enjoy to do
on myself but I don't want to have
clients this is why I tell people
don't make wigs for people this is why
I'm only selling the ones that I've used
to review and I wore out because I'm not
like to start taking orders um because I
want to give my all into something and I
don't want to end up in a situation
where I have all these orders because
I'm being money hungry and now I'm just
kind of half-assed in my product and
then what's happening is the clients who
are paying top dollar to buy the wigs
that I'm making are not getting what
they should get back for me I'm a
consumer so therefore I don't want to
give out what I personally would
consider to be the best quality myself
that's another reason why I do not have
a hair company because it takes so much
of your time in your effort to
quality-control everything because every
single bundle is very different every
donor is very different and people don't
take this in consideration they see
nothing but money and then all of a
sudden they end up trying to just say
okay well I'm gonna do this I'm gonna
teach a class and you're teaching the
class and you don't even know what the
fundamentals are and you're teaching
these people and taking their money now
you have people like pique mill one
thing is amazing at what she does she's
teaching classes if you guys are
interested she's one of those people
that I will go to her class there's
another guy on instagram named prince
carter 90 he's the with frontals
he's way better than I am and he's he
holds classes as well you got talking
yourselves another great artist he holds
classes as well these are people that I
think are great at what they do but for
somebody who's a stylist to try to tell
me how I should be making my money shows
that she's not making any you know so
then she made another comment cuz you
guys you know y'all y'all be messy too
we all miss it together
um what's hiding in the things that she
was saying that last thing I checked I'm
not paying her no more mine but I think
I check was people will do anything for
you to check but that's just chump
change and I'm thinking to myself like
you know that's really cute for you um
and I'll keep making chump change in my
living in Sherman Oaks and I know she
says she's in LA probably aside um just
cute Jordan she had on when I was 10 I
had also cute and I'll keep on stomping
in my nice nine hundred to a thousand
dollars every with my chump change you
know but I just think that when you
start as an artist coming at other
people that means that your business is
because I know Silas out here don't have
time for Instagram they post our clients
they repost our clients and they go
about their day and I'm the same way I
don't look at other artists I don't
follow
many other people who make wigs only
because I'm just not that interested you
know it's just the truth and there's
nothing with wrong with seeing what
other people do because it definitely
can help you out in what you do there
are other people that I am associate
acquaintances with here on YouTube where
I see some of the techniques that they
use and I've used them and they work and
there's nothing wrong with that
but I would never ever fix my lips to
come to another person about what they
do and try to tell them how they should
make money and I'm so caught telling
secrets because i'ma tell you this if
Houdini himself told the entire world
how he did his I can guarantee you
there's not one in this
world that would do it like him and that
is the difference between you and I my
dear okay I don't take clients in LA but
I can guarantee if I did she would have
none let's just keep that if I'm usually
am cool but I just feel like a lot of
times people who have so much to say can
never back it up I've seen her work and
I don't think that her work is terrible
but I definitely don't think it's the
best the way she's talking No okay so
when it comes down to critiquing another
artist you have to watch your mouth
because when all is said and done when
you start to look whether she felt what
she was saying is fact or it was just
simply her or her opinion it still
doesn't matter because nobody asks you
and if you're such a great stylist then
you would not be charging $75 or 175 for
nobody so in just saying you know if you
if you top dollar then make sure that
show your let your work speak for itself
I'm not gonna tell you how great I am at
hair I'm not gonna tell you hi I'm this
I'm not going to tell you how that I can
be my face I'm gonna let my work speak
for itself and when you start speaking
for your work that means that your work
is very okay it's so hard it needs work
the work needs work so I just watch in
any field that you do in any other field
that you any in I can't tell Beyonce how
to be a singer because bitch I don't
know how to sing as much as I think I
can in the shower my neighbors have let
me know in the dogs that ain't for me
okay but I'm not gonna go tell her what
she can if she can see if rihanna
doesn't hit all the notes at the VMAs it
doesn't make me a critic yeah
they may not have been the best maybe
somebody thought it was great I don't
know but I don't critique too much about
 that I don't know I don't watch
football and tell somebody who fumble
cause quite frankly I don't even over
 that is so this is what I'm saying
stay in your place stay in your lane
nobody is in this happens often it's the
stylist versus the youtuber and the
reason why the stylists are really mad
is because they feel like youtubers are
taking their clients and when all is
said and done rather I went to school
which you said right next to you and we
learned the same curriculum we're still
not the same people so don't be upset if
I'm doing something that you could have
done and you didn't do or don't be
afraid or don't be mad at something that
you could have came and asked me you
know because how she spoke she knew a
little too much and that's chump change
to the check well you wouldn't based on
your numbers you don't get a check so
therefore I don't believe you that you
would know but for you to have so much
input you want that check that though
it's not when people say well I'm too
good for this but they know so much
about something you still did your
research to try to figure out how you
can be part of that you want that check
though so I always encourage people I
don't have a problem with nobody if you
want to come on YouTube I've given you
guys tools to be hair reviewers stop
whatever and I don't have an issue with
that because my business is my business
and your business is your business and
when you try to compare your business to
somebody else's business
you need to start money your own okay
cuz I'm gonna tell you when you so
consumed about you you don't have time
for the next and what they
doing and where they going and because
it becomes too much I can't tell you
what this bitch is doing because I'm too
busy like I told you once before
it's like texting and driving you got to
pick one because it could be an accident
if you decide to do both at the same
time okay you make you wait with it a
few times within the eventually gonna
catch up with you so to that young lady
my advice to you would be get you some
business okay
get you some clients figure out what
tons of blonde work for you because the
current one you
don't and that's no shade listen us who
went to beauty school be understand what
the color wheel looks like okay and some
don't match others just saying but i'ma
leave it at that
only because kind of turn into a rant
but to all my hairstylist out here doing
your thing it up I yeah if you hold
in classes if you own YouTube if you own
Instagram whatever the situation is
it up but I'm going to tell you in life
there are no such things as secrets okay
Sallis hairstylist don't have secrets
because when all is said and done
somebody knows something that you don't
there are things that I just learned
that people been doing for 20 years and
vice versa so you just depends so when
people speak for everybody
they make this self look like an ass cuz
nobody is worried about you and what
you're doing so get all y'all out here
getting your clients up up all
y'all getting your money it up all
your honor who's playin frontals wigs
and everything else it up in to the
haters who are worried about what
everybody else is doing get you some
business okay because that's the only
way you're gonna be able to keep a queen
that's all good night</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
