guys have asked what my opinion is on
the zendaya coleman plane Aliya in the
new a lifetime biopic and I have a few
opinions about the situation and I get
whenever there's something alia related
I always get a shitload of Instagram
messages tags and Twitter messages and
Facebook messages asking like what do
you feel about this or whatever and it
feels good because I've been a Lea fan
you know she is my core she she is when
I was younger who was the person that I
looked up to it was her and Brandi were
my two favorites growing up so to hear I
mean for years we've heard that there's
supposed to be a movie and a little you
know quickly after her passing I don't
think it was even a year after her
passing that I kept start to hear little
stuff and rumblings about there being
some type of a little movie I remember
when I first seen Selena and uh I was
young when I first seen Selena and I had
no idea who Selena was I honestly I
thought it was just a movie and it was
like kind of a fictional character I
didn't I didn't know Jennifer Lopez was
playing another woman I had no clue
about that so when I found out that
Selena was actually a real person I was
like like she did a good job and then to
see how great she lip sing and how great
they matched him up or whatever and I
know at that time when she auditioned
for Selena it was her and a lot of other
young ladies trying to get that
particular role and a lot of Selena fans
did not want Jennifer Lopez to player
because Jennifer Lopez is a known proud
Puerto Rican woman and Selena was a
Mexican woman and they felt like that
was know that day but we clearly that
was wrong another instance is an Angela
Bassett playing Tina Turner and we all
know Angela Bassett to have played
everyone's mama she's played Becky's
mama she's played Michael Jackson's mama
she's played pretty much everyone's mom
at this particular point she looks
nothing like Katherine Jackson she looks
nothing like Tina Turner however those
were some very
kind of grows that she's played because
at the end of the day I don't think
people get that it's an adaptation of
someone's life this stuff is not always
correct even t-boz and Chile told you
during the TLC movie again little mama
people heard little mama playing left
eye and was like what the hell are you
talking about as she went and murdered
the role and P everybody who had to eat
crow after that cuz it was like well she
did do that you know like she did that
so when it comes down to zendaya playing
Lea do I feel it was the wrong choice
I don't know zendaya to be an actress
like that I've seen her in Disney movies
you know a lot of cousins they watch
Disney movies and stuff like that I've
seen her eyes though she was a cute very
pretty young lady I've seen her little
like her dolls at Toys R Us because you
know it's like Barbie so I see that the
Disney dolls or whatever she looks more
like Cassie then she does alia that's
yeah okay so the looks a lot of people I
keep hearing because I heard Teyana
Taylor was auditioning for this role
which in no offense to tiana cuz I
really like Tiana I really do I loved
her since MySpace mmm-hmm that just
wouldn't work that's too far off looking
at looks Department to be alia younam's
and maybe was on I should've dated him
sorry but it's not gonna I wouldn't even
disrespect her family in her legacy like
that by even doing it even if they were
okay with it
I still would not do that y'all tried it
um I've heard other people of course
Keshia chante um I've heard Lolita price
the thing about loading the price
because she is on YouTube is she's a
bulk of what she's known for is for
looking like I live just like this
particular dude I met on Pride weekend
named de Mario Brown he looks just like
Tupac like just like Jamaa
and he's known for looking like two
 so I think well with Lolita she
looks a lot like alia a lot like smile
wise like it's kind of scary sometimes
at how much they resemble one another
the issue that people I don't think
give or they don't understand or they
don't kind of understand about the the
business and that lifetime isn't looking
for a girl who looks a lot like I live
because we're gonna be very honest here
if you take a girl who's fair-skinned
give her a long black weave with the
school with some glasses and a lot of
time he'll figure she too could look
like I live no I don't know about any
close-ups but from a distance yeah she
could look like Eileen - it wasn't hard
for me on Halloween to do it or whatever
but the thing about her that was so
unique was her essence who she was as a
person everything from a head nod to a
wink had an individuality about it that
stamped her for who she was and if you
can't capture that no matter how much
how good you look like a person how much
you look like a person it's not gonna
come through as that person I know that
the Whitney Houston movie is getting
made as well on lifetime and Yaya from
America's Next Top Model is playing
Whitney Houston that that right there I
can actually see because yeah yeah does
favorite Whitney younger Whitney a lot
you know more sodas and daya looks like
alia the thing that I don't like about
this whole entire situation is that from
my understanding her family was not
consulted by the with this situation to
do any you know was lifetime now
somebody had to sign off on something
because in order to use her likeness
somebody had to consent for that to be
okay so I don't buy that
they're blindsided decided her uncle is
a very very Henderson is a very shady
character let's just make that real
clear very shady character okay just
google his name you find out i'ma leave
it at that
but um he's he's he's released music -
to Drake and Chris Brown and stuff like
that you know just off the piggyback of
her legacy you know and he owns the
rights to her music because he was in
black round which where she was um if
you look up Jojo the singer a lot of how
she feel about black ground that kind of
that would pretty much elaborate on what
I'm talking about
now but anyway so he said that they're
gonna lawyer up and do this I think what
happened was at some point in time there
was a idea for a movie to be made and
papers were signed and they were
consents made for this movie to be to be
made I think what happened was somehow
someway those papers got into the
offices of lifetime and with everything
being signed saying her likeness can be
used for whoever makes the movie that I
they probably were not aware that the
movie that was going to be made or the
offer was put on the table for a
lifetime to do it and it was gonna be a
TV movie because they don't they said
they're not opposed to a movie they're
just they don't want it to be on TV they
want it to be a theatrical release like
notorious or Selina
like that they don't want it to be on
like regular TV so I'm just kind of like
okay but I think at the end of the day a
Leah's father passed away in 2012 and I
like me who don't know that and at least
mother was diagnosed with cancer last
year
so I don't really it was just a Rashaad
her brother and her mother left and I
don't think that if they're not ready
and they don't want to see the person
that has been there everything for a
very long time immortalized on screen
like that and happened to look at a
young lady and body their daughter and
their sister right now I don't think
that it should be done if they're not
ready to do it from what I'm
understanding they have said many times
especially her brother has been very
vocal on Twitter about he does not want
a movie no no girl he feels can play his
sister and he has you have to respect
him for that you know at the end of the
day you have to respect him for feeling
that way because before she was Ilia mr.
one-in-a-million miss you know AJ number
the number she was Ilia his sister she
was a littler daughter she was not just
a singer and I think that's the thing is
that the public becomes selfish to the
family and forget that they have
feelings and they go through things and
they have to mourn and yes it's been a
number of years since her passing but
because a person passes in time goes on
it doesn't always make the wounds go
away yeah you can continue to go on but
there's always a piece of you that's
gonna still be missing and let's just
behind
a movie does not have to be made about
her life and I think honestly the reason
why her family does not want a movie to
probably either be made or have no
creative control over it because we all
know the marriage to our Kelly we all
know the relationship with our Kelly the
relationship with jay-z Dane - that
whole situation or whatever a lot of
people would like to know how those
situations took place in honesty its
number of business so hurt hurt legacy
ally as the legacy is our angel she you
know she didn't do anything wrong even
though clearly she's not that she was an
angel like that but they have stamped
her legacy like that and I don't think
they want to go and taint her legacy at
all with with some truth you know that's
just I'm sorry certain things about
certain people we knew every single
thing about these artists our singers
are actors who have passed away we would
look at them in such a different light
and I think that's the thing her family
wants to keep her her legacy and her
being and what she promoted and what she
did just as that how she left it they
don't want to start to pull cats on a
bag say oh did you know she was doing it
- all did you know this is why this
happened and that's why that happened
and then it it out and I don't really
think I want to sit in the theater or on
watch on TV to see like what Selena the
way they did her death was I think in a
very classy respectful way but it still
makes me cry to this day to know of
really what happened at the young lady
was shot in the back by somebody that
she trusted you know so I don't know how
they would try to skim over a plane
crash or hide a was just trying to
announce it you know but I don't like
how people are attacking zendaya as if
she did something wrong so they can't
help the fact that she does not look
like alia this young lady is a 17 year
old multi-talented young lady who got an
opportunity to play one of her very
influential and flowing influential
idols and I think if any of us got this
opportunity we too would have took it
so to bash her about her not looking
like a leonid and all this stuff is
childish and it's a lot of it's coming
from a lot of hugh those do i agree with
the casting no but well i not support
her in her efforts to bring a legacy and
bring a visuality i guess you could say
a nice visual in a movie to someone that
I love and I've looked up to it I'm
idolizing of course I think that it's
really hard to find girls who look like
someone who can act who can sing who can
do this now I heard that the family's
gonna block the music so we can't use
the music and then I heard and they
recorded some songs for the movie now
that's where I gotta draw the line I
don't want to hear something singing uh
one in a million
I don't want it we see we heard of
Mariana try that name and that was a
fail so no we don't want to do that so I
don't really know how this is gonna go
I'm hearing it they're trying to put a
halt on the actual movie itself so it
might actually not even come out but
what do you guys feel about this do you
guys feel like it's time for the family
to you know tell her story or do you
feel like it's disrespectful and people
need to rest in peace and that's why
there's no Ben no Tupac movie because
hurry
his mother doesn't feel like it's
necessary for it to be a movie about his
life right now she doesn't want to see
that all right you know whatever the
situation is so you guys let me know
what you guys feel about that but that's
pretty much my take on it I'm a huge
alia fan and I would love a movie about
her particular life but if her mother
doesn't feel like it's necessary didn't
I I don't mm-hmm
because I will bring I want to respect
her mother and and that's her daughter
and it's not about what I want as a fan
because I have music I have movies I do
things I could do I don't have to have
this this is extra this is a a bonus
this is not a must so yeah so let me
know what guys think and how do you feel
about zendaya
I think she's a cute young lady and she
seems very bubbly and vibrant and I
don't know what could happen if she
could come out and turn a roll out and
have every eye wink point and laughter
on point and you can't say anything
about it and you still get that essence
or it could be a flop it is a lifetime I
didn't like concert Versace I don't like
the end of Nicole Smith movie I didn't
like that uh Gabby Douglas movie so who
knows but let me know down below</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
