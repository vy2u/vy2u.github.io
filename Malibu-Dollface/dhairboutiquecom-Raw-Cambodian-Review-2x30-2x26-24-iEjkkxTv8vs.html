I'm going to be reviewing for you should
have come on car already you know uh D
Hair Boutique I always want to say D H
hair blue t got on the line but um this
is their car that I was sent and it says
D Hair Boutique the number one source
for natural human hair they are located
in Dallas Texas I was contacted by them
a via Instagram first and then I was
sent an email and then they asked me we
correspond it back and forth and they
asked me what type of hair did I like I
seen Lakia stars hair my boo and she had
some red hair from them was the
Cambodian the wrong Cambodian hair so
that's what I was sent um I was saying
four bundles of hair I was sent to tune
to 30s I want to say it was - 30 - 26 I
was saying five bundles later excuse me
I was in - 30s a 26 a 24 and a 20 - I
want to say if I don't know if those are
the exact length that I actually have
but I will post them below if just for
reference just sorry that you're not um
it only took them about a week to send
me the hair which is great because you
know or probably a little bit of under a
week I don't remember exactly how long
it took but it was within a seven to ten
day process um when I received each a
bundle of hair as I posted on Instagram
they all came like knotted up because
his hair has like a natural way this is
not the natural state of their eye flexi
rod and curl do this and then they fail
and then IRA curl them um but they all
came like knotted up in these little Oh
balls and they all had a tag like these
attached to them to let you know what
your lanes are so from and I like them
because they're not
some hair will say it's 30 and it'll be
like 34 then sometimes you say is 28 and
then it's like 20 fo so this tells you
is between 28 and 30 it depends because
everybody's hair isn't some people's
hair isn't exactly 30 inches you know
whoever's getting scalped so um yeah I
love these tags uh very chic
utility spent money which is great
because it's all about the packaging and
all about the presentation um I've had
this hair in for about three weeks now
and this u part has not came off at all
you let me tell y'all just let me just
as I know y'all was about to around
and take this off cuz I have to took my
braids out and I did the review and then
the one I did before this it did not
save and I would have took this off and
would have been pissed off but anyway um
yeah I've had this hair on for like
three weeks because I got a sick I put
it in put it on and put the pictures on
Instagram and then I was going to do the
review the next day we went out I got
sick and this hair has been rocking with
me ever since I will say this is some of
the best hair that I've had due to the
simple fact that when I had the bonnet
on you guys nonstick with awnings on my
head for days and I mean dude of me just
being sick and sweating and coughing and
all this is that any other I'm gonna
take it off this hair hat I'd still a
beautiful luster is still calm doubt it
was no kings no naps no anything in the
hair that you know would have been like
oh this hair is it wasn't Bobby boss
let's just say that um it definitely uh
is shed a little bit when I was putting
it in because I did cut my left so that
probably has something to do with it but
it wasn't horrible it was it was the
minimal shedding that you get when you
do cut whips it just happens um
so I didn't have any issues there and I
don't now when I do this you know
nothing comes out it's good so sometimes
that just happens with hair what I will
say and I can say this like with
confidence these are some of the best
constructed webs I have ever had a day
in my life and I'll also
eh these are the flattest thinnest
sweats with the most hair I've ever
gotten because I've never experienced
hair usually the more hair that you have
or the thicker the hair is the thicker
the web is and the thicker the web is
the harder is to flatten out your weave
or your you part or whatever the
situation is the the West on these are
so like they're little like the let webs
are living which I love I was sewing
this in like yes so you know I just came
out of before this I came out of a lace
you part and that's way different from
wearing the sole in or a regular you
part because it's so flat so I would got
used to having such flat hair and
wearing it like this but wearing it
really flat so I was like it's gonna be
like not bulky because I'm gonna make it
as flat as I can but it's still not
gonna be what I want it to be oh it is
it is that and some more this is going
in another pal of old faithfuls um and I
will say that my bundles were very long
and I only spat about three and a half
four bundles on my head I said a fold on
the left and I have this piece left or
whatever and that says a lot because
y'all know who I am I played it wherever
I can fit it I will put it and because
there was so much hair that came in each
bundle each bundle was probably about
the same length but they were long and
the law of virgin hair um is the longer
the length is shorter the bundle the
shorter the length the longer the bundle
no no they all were the same and they
all were long as hell so I end up
fitting as much as I could on cap but I
couldn't get all the hair on there but I
loved that because we never want to
plead never want to pay the high price
and get this much hair you know I'm
saying so I think that I don't know I
don't know if everybody's experiences I
don't know if it's just me I don't know
but what I will say is I love the fact
that them them the long okay the hair is
long but they were long and I was just
like wow this
a lot of here now I seen when I first
seen the hair I'm like okay I don't
think I'm gonna be able to get all this
hair on there but I always say that and
then I always making it always find a
way to make it fit but this time I
couldn't make it but it was good um so
yeah that is a good thing about it I
don't have it I know like I haven't did
it like a bad review or anything on any
hair but I've yet to receive any bad
hair so you know I'm saying these
companies are I've gotten good here so
um yeah I think if you have any
questions you could let me know I
haven't had any shedding and entangling
any matting and out this hair been
through the trenches with me y'all I was
sick um and it still bounced back with
no problems I've washed his hair about
three times with my organic shampoo I
did cut it a little bit because you know
how at the bottom
it's probably like a 28 26 now it was a
30 but you know at the bottom the hair
is not full like this it has like the
little scraggly pieces that no matter
how hard you curl it is still not
attractive so I just um I just cut them
off so yeah that's pretty much all the
trimming that I did and I played like a
little light layer in it so that it
could have some body to it but I didn't
really cut much as you can see I didn't
really cut much out of it
um cuz I don't want anything to lose the
integrity in the length because we start
cutting a lot like I mean I cut a lot
but when you start cutting too much it
just started getting choppy and you
can't wear it straight like this you
have to always wear it curly because
it's gonna look stupid so yeah that's
all I really have to say about this here
this is definitely gonna be um some here
I'll go back to I haven't had a chance
to like we wear any of my you parts
because I could get in there so yeah um
that's about it and if you have any
