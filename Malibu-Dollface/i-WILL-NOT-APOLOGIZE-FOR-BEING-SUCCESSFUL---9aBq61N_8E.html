already up for this hair which is my
steamer hair from Aliexpress so that's
nothing this videos about though this
video is a topic video and it's about I
will name this video I will not
apologize okay and the reason for this
is because I feel as if a lot of people
want you to apologize for being
successful these days and what I mean by
that is success is measured by different
people in different ways
some people think success is a lot of
money a lot of cars a lot of homes other
people think that success is being
having a great spiritual base a lot of
people think successful is being all of
the things that are just named plus so
much more but for me I think that a lot
of times people become very envious of
you when you are successful in any facet
of the world and a lot of times the
reason why these people feel like this
is because they're not in the same boat
as you recently I've had issues where
I've had people that I knew and I didn't
know kind of start to fill away you know
towards me and a new but do what
the I'm supposed to do which is
succeed in life you know and I feel like
when you starts to succeed in life but
you start to do things that are great
and are they're benefiting you and
you're not hurting anyone trying to get
there you're not climbing on anybody
stepping on anyone's toes but another
person will see that and because you're
making that much more effort that
they're not making they start to look at
you as the enemy as the person that is
the issue and it's like I'm not the one
with the problem you are I thought we
were supposed to do this together I
thought we were both supposed to be
talking about how successful one another
is not you're having an issue with me
because of this or you're seeing my
success as an issue and our relationship
or our friendship or whatever the
situation is and I want you guys to
understand this sometimes people are
four-season sometimes you grow up with
people sometimes you meet people a year
and you're not friends with them anymore
sometimes family members have to be cut
off because
I will not apologize for being
successful I will not apologize for
doing the things that I'm supposed to do
I have been through a whole lot I have
come across a lot of people who've been
through a lot worse than me I come
across a lot of people who have had it
better than me you know
but one thing that still seems to remain
with a lot of people that I see is just
very constant is the lack of effort and
a whole lot of complaining and I feel
like listen we all go through we
all have issues that we have to work on
to become better a better us but if
you're blaming the world as to why you
are not moving you are the problem
okay because when all is said and done
no one gives a about your sad
little story and that sounds harsh but
that is the world no one gives a
about why you're sad nobody gives a
about why you don't have money nobody
gives a about why you were sick
nobody cares this is why when you have a
job and you're sick as a dog and they
call you and say are you coming in and
you say well I don't feel good and they
like so you're still coming right
they don't care because there's a job
there's a goal for them that they need
to meet that involves you so are you
gonna be down or not so I want you guys
to understand in life things do happen
and in life you go through a lot but you
also have to understand that a lot of
times you cannot just sit back and let
the world snatch you by your ankles and
drive you until you can't breathe
sometimes you have to get out of being
what was me sometimes you have to get
out of oh I'm in a very bad situation
and nobody cares and and nobody probably
do care but you have to care because I
can't even more than you she can't
give a more than you so what do you
want to do do you want to be a victim or
do you want to be the hero
do you want to kisses eat what the thing
is I find a lot of times people get
upset at the fact that you are striving
so well that they have such a big issue
and a problem and they find the reason
to say well I don't really like you
because you this or a lot of times what
I do find with a lot of females with
myself is
I have the girls who with me hard
and they you know I see y'all on the
street you when we pound it up and we
laugh we act stupid then I have the
girls who say they don't like me because
I want to be them and I'm so jealous of
their lives but watch me and the reason
is because they feel some type of threat
understand this I am a man and I will
always be a man there is nothing that I
can do that will become a woman to make
me more of a woman than you so there is
no threat there okay so if you feel
comfortable in your drawers mama there
is no other person Intimidator or not
that should be able to fill your shoes
that's why I don't feel the way when
women come at me like that
because I don't feel no time well that's
not what I'm trying to do in the first
place which you fill away you know it's
like when persons say she thinks she
cute no you think she cute that bitches
over there mind her cute ass business
mission you pointed out something that
we all see you know cuz you feel
threatened so don't let another person's
success and how they're thriving and the
way they're shaking and moving in this
world to deter you from what you're
trying to do okay what you're trying to
do is what the you trying to do you
stand that you say that focus these
people are out here winning they mad cuz
blac chyna doing this and Emeril's is
doing this and the rest but girls are
doing this and they don't do nothing but
lay on the back and kim kardashian ain't
nothing but a ho but see the difference
is I don't give a about how you got
it long as you get and you wouldn't hurt
nobody on your way up to get it cuz the
way I like I said in the beginning to
this video the way you measure success
is not the same for everyone so
therefore I don't give a how
successful you think I am or not
understanding my success when I do
receive it it's gonna be the and if
you have an issue or a problem with that
that's your problem
again that sounds like a personal
problem in the immortal words of Miss
RuPaul what you feel about me is none of
my damn business
okay so therefore a lot of you guys have
to understand if you see a person
succeeding in life and they're doing
great things with them they're something
like give them a clap we talked about
this before give them a clap but don't
allow somebody else to say that you're
wrong for being successful or you should
apologize because you did the work and
they don't want to
do the work that's I bet I can give you
a pound and give you a piece of out
because I'm not gonna sit up here and go
back and forth with you a lot of people
a lot of wrong people have this problem
and it's like so you're mad at her for
what I met you you sitting at your desk
right now wishing you was laying on your
back for a day so you could be living in
a multi-million dollar mansions and I'm
not saying how she got it is the way to
go but I'm saying she's there and for
you to have an attitude about image what
do you have and sometimes it could not
even be a financial gain of what she has
she probably got a piece of my cashing
on her bills every month you still
worried about bills
hello okay but you can't be I don't I
wouldn't if I was her I wouldn't
apologize either if I was Indian wrestle
I would not buy apologize either its
life and you have to understand you have
to get in the game play the game and
play a position the best position you
know how to play and then you're gonna
become something successful but when you
go you start worried about what this
bitch is doing how the are you
worrying about what you're doing okay I
can't I can't text and drop I have to
pick one do you want to text or do you
want to try cuz when you try to do both
it usually turns out to be a bit mixed a
problem an accident and that's not what
you want so learn to stay focused on you
and don't apologize for being a great
person and doing what you're supposed to
do in this world to become someone
better okay a lot of people want to stay
complacent and what they're so used to
doing and then when you start passing
them by they want to say that you change
I have changed I become a better person
okay a person who's supposed to go
forward and have goals and life not a
person still sitting here complaining
about what was me and what happened in
1999
we're in 2000 almost 16 why are you
still there okay
ketchup its problem so yeah do what
y'all do this is a new year coming if
you had a goal to do something do it and
if anybody else is telling you matter of
fact that if don't even tell my
buddy
just do it and then share okay therefore
you have to worry about nobody trying to
crush your dreams okay no matter what it
is I don't give a whether you want
to go natural or you want to buy a BMW
do it it's your business and keep your
busy
your business stops sharing with every
person especially a person you know who
doesn't have any goals about the goals
you're trying to achieve they're not
gonna understand okay they're not gonna
get so on that note I will catch y'all
in my next one
but again treat yourself like the treat
yourself as your biggest fan okay if you
love Beyonce love yourself that much
more because that way you're gonna be
able to get to a level where you see
yourself in such a light where you're
proud of yourself don't allow nobody to
dim your light because their
insecurities because people will do that
misery loves company okay peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
