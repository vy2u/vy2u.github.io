i'm a maxxinista bitch
um so yesterday i have posted yesterday
 was today i had posted my 2017
intro video for my princess hair shop
fire right here let's let him read his
orange and pink so you guys know that i
the song that I used was the breakdown
from Lindsay Lohan zé's song rumors and
in the video after the breakdown Lindsay
does her whole illuminati with the
eye or whatever the you want to
call it so I'm sucking off a friend
about it and I was like you know I want
to do something and she's like what do
you mean and I was like I want to do
something I was like I want to do
something that's kind of gonna probably
cause a little stir but I just want to
see how smart people really are and
everybody is a genius let them
tell how this all came about was I had
came up with this idea to do the hair
based on little Kim from the mm mm mm TV
award promos that she did with David
LaChapelle so like I really want to do
this color found the colors probables
who are asking I'll get to that in a
review but if you want to know now I use
blazing orange with blaze orange sunrise
orange and hot pink and my hair was a
613 so I called my friend and I was like
I really want to do this and she was
like what do you want to do so I
explained it because the concept was
always the same it was the song that was
the question so I said well is red
Lindsay Lohan I can't think of a Lindsay
Lohan song that I like I'm like who else
has red hair and of course it was
Lindsay so not that rig but obviously
she's a ginger and then I was like well
I love rumors you know speak was one of
is my favorite lesbian album but um
rumor is the breakdown I just was it was
very gutsy of Lindsay to come out there
and to someone to step on this so I
thought it was very interesting to go
ahead
do you know do the breakdown so when I
was talking to her about it I was like
okay at the end of it she does to hold
the whole all-seeing eye do I do
that or do I not do that because I'm
kind of paying homage to her but I'm a
little naughty bitch because if I was I
would be shooting this video in a
mansion okay and my subscribers would be
like pho times the amount so she was
like woah do this do it and see what
people say because we've just had a
conversation about how people don't
think for themselves and they let every
little thing lead them to believe
something that is not necessarily true
okay I'm back at the house Bhagawan said
do you ever went to Taco Bell and got a
airhead white mystery girl it is so and
thing is it's a mystery you don't know
what you don't get but they always been
good since I tried
I am malleable doll face in yes is mom
okay everyone what I wanted to do I'm go
ahead and do it and I'ma see cuz we were
just talking we were having a
conversation about this and it's because
we were on the shade room and somebody
had posted something and then somebody
was like they think something and jump
to a conclusion about something else
and then we were sitting there like
everybody's talking like she really
noticed bitch no need we do they used to
be friends no she was just like people
just like you really be talking factual
 that ain't sexual towards a lot
went ahead filmed it edited I had to do
that particular scene about four or five
times not six six six times I was like
okay then I can I don't went back and
forth but actually putting it in cuz it
was gonna be another shot that I did I
was like whatever I'm just gonna put in
error at this point I just feel like
it's what it is like is usually when I
do something or I'll do a video from my
heart and then usually I'll edit it down
so it doesn't sound as harsh as it may
come off cuz that's enough nothing on
your so I did it and of course
and I put what I did was I when I put it
on Instagram because I put it on there
first and I wrote a caption and at the
very end of the caption I said and I
just want to say no I'm not part of the
goddamn Illuminati because I know
somebody gonna say that so when I posted
it here I put it in the caption and most
of the time I've said this I don't know
how many times I will do a video tell
you everything about it post the
information and the caption the title
says it and somebody will still say
something so I think it was about four
or five people and the some party
started they were just being silly this
girl was like oh never mind for me
starting my channel I'm subbing this
look at the world and you look stupid so
again people people let's start to be a
little more smarter about our decision
it's okay I don't know for all those who
are so goddamn educated in this thing
cuz I watched some videos that Lord
Serena Williams and Venus are
transsexuals Barack Obama's alien
Michelle's a man too I mean it's just
where do people have the time to come up
with all these conspiracies and the
whole all-seeing eye from what I got to
just stuff cuz I read up on it cuz I was
just curious to see like okay what does
it mean this wasn't recently you guys
know years ago I did a video I think on
my other channel called are you a victim
of the Illuminati Panos their game and
all rhyme I was just watching videos and
I just thought it was a very interesting
topic it really didn't take it serious
and knowing anybody
I ain't sacrifice nobody ain't nobody
hit me up about nothing you know some
people are just a little too invested in
 that's really not the truth
so from what I know when I do the whole
I I'll see a nice and after you
have after apparently is shown there's a
clusterfuck of images that come after
that I supposed to be put in the back of
your subconscious mind and that is the
point of it because they are supposedly
programming you there was no images
bitch at the end of that that she went
off but again I was
paying homage to Lindsay now I don't
know what Lindsay then did and I don't
know what group she didn't because she
can harass with to the beach so I don't
know but what I will say is people y'all
gonna do better y'all be thinking too
much about the beach it's dumb but my
point was to show that people don't pay
attention because I wrote this whole
long thing to give you an understanding
of what it was and still you still have
bitches that went right over the
potatoes and went straight for to me you
get what I'm saying
everybody's a genius let them tell you
this is the world we learn either so yes
I do think that people are stupid and
it's by choice I don't think people
education is some educating yourself is
a great thing
some bitch is just too lazy they so
worried about what the Rihanna and
in that nigga talking about or why JLo
and Drake are around
Instagram live how do you feel about J
Loren drink a little ass but I'm happy
for the both of them cuz they get any
rocks off and if it wasn't gonna be JLo
bitch yeah well it won't be you either
so let go of all that madness
so I thought you guys in a new year I'm
gonna do more vlogging this is what I'm
doing just what I feel with my white
head mystery having a good time
chillin acting stupid living life being
happy okay so I will catch all the news
please</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
