hesitated knighted me for my skills and
now he'll feel this match to see me
working hard so baby you better give up
me work you know after wearing short
hair for freaking it feels like forever
I finally got me some more 34 inch hair
and so um this hair is from the one and
only our glam hair this is the bag that
all of my bundles that I've received
from them so far I've come into all I
have in 10 bundles of 34 inch and I'm
like oh my gosh I've never worked that
much hair one time although I've heard
other people say it and then I posted on
Instagram that I had in seven and a half
bundles up 34 inch people were like oh
my god like why so much hair um and it's
really full and people like is it heavy
I'm like it's not heavy is actually very
flowy it's very light it's not heavy at
all however um I spoken about this
before on my channel but you guys also
know that um will you do by longer
lengths the actual weft gets shorter it
really just depends on the company I
know you guys know that I have 34 inches
once before but I ended up cutting that
and it was like this when I originally
had that one as well but I needed up
cutting that into a middle part and
putting layers into it and of course
when you put layers in it it takes a lot
of the length in the hair away expose
even you chopping a lot of the front off
so I didn't want to do that originally
this was supposed to be a Morticia
Addams inspired look was supposed to be
a dead set middle part and then it was
supposed to just be bone straight with
no layers what ended up happening was
the closure was too short and this is my
Silva closure from closure store but my
closure was too short so when you're
closing short like that
it stops at a certain point so it's like
you have already its built-in layer that
you're not going to be able to get rid
of so I had to pretty much oh you know
do what I know and I wanted it straight
and sleek I did not want it to be curled
at all I've been doing a lot of curls
lately and I miss you know my one in a
million hair this is their Brazilian
straight bone straight okay
this hair straightens like a dream a lot
of you guys always ask me what flat
irons I use on my straight hair this is
the only flat iron that I use on my
straight hair and this is their
Remington Remington um I don't know what
size this is but just look at it around
my hand and you can Otakon go from there
but I think it's like the the biggest
one that they make I use this to pretty
much seal my lust earnestness in and
then also I receive this really
beautiful crystal blinged-out
as you can see I wrote glam hair flat
iron and I use this for like a lot of my
bang area like right here in the front
I'm just to kind of go over it it's not
hot right now and this goes up to four
hundred and forty four hundred and
eighty-five degrees this thing and I you
guys know I have two different sizes
when it comes to straight hair because
you have to get the roots like the root
area you have to get that and you really
can't get that because this is too big
but this covers a lot of area in a
little bit amount of time so this is for
more solar for the root area but I will
say that it does um it's beautiful but
it's functional sometimes you end up
with stuff like this and then it's just
really cute to have but it really
doesn't serve a real purpose cuz I know
I was I was given one any work really
well but it only lived to like two
hundred and something degrees so you
guys know I think this one goes to
perfect on 455 as well so these two are
the only things that I use to make sure
that my hair stay pin straight and you
guys know I've talked about the products
that I use which is the be honest ohm
spray which is the orange spray and I
use the Guardian tees maximum hold spray
can I mix that and it keeps my hair
it keeps my hair like this like just
very fine very silky it moves it doesn't
have any issues no problems you know and
it still stays I could literally do a
cartwheel with this and go right back to
place I've been wearing this hair for
quite some time because I have been
super super obsessed with super duper
long hair lately and I missed it you
guys know this is something that I am
uber obsessed with so I had to bring my
signature back in such a long length now
because a lot of people I know are this
is not realistic for your everyday life
but this is great problem here just the
great graduation here this is great
birthday hair so you know you kind of
just find a stylist who can install this
correctly because no matter how
beautiful the bundles are how much
luster is in this hair if it is not cut
right and it is not installed right it
is going to look a hot mess and
especially when hair is so long you want
this part of your hair where your
closure is you are all this to lay down
you do not want to end up with a big
thick tear memory
slash hazel-e bump that's not cute okay
so make sure whoever is installing your
hair with a closure I would have loved a
frontal with it look I don't know if I'm
going to love a frontal with it I would
have probably loved a closure in the
same in the same length so because I
could have did what I wanted to do but
it's really hard when you start doing
your hair moving in I provided it in the
middle part and I would have done it you
would it look beautiful but as soon as I
move you can start seeing my layers that
were my closure stops so I pretty much
went ahead and cut these layers in it so
I can have this nice beautiful aerial
Barbie you know thing you know I'm not
going to cut this hair I am NOT because
I come over here and it hurt my soul
it's not like 28 inches now and that may
not seen a lot of y'all but it's not
this it is definitely not this the
second batch of hair that I got from our
work Glenn and I also wanted to switch
it up too because you guys know the
best review that I did for them which I
will put here um that hair had a middle
part so I didn't just want to do the
same style but just a middle part with
no girls I wanted to just kind of do
something and I love to throw my hair
you know I love to swing it and give it
you know value
ba-ba-boom so of course but so far so
good I have experienced a bit of
shedding from this hair
it hasn't been excessive it hasn't been
crazy but I have had a little bit of it
um since when I first put it in I was
getting like a strand here or strand
there and now I'm getting like a trend
like every couple of days it's not
really major and as full as my hair is
you would not think that it um shed it
at all and then again I actually have a
bundle left a full bundle and like uh
probably this much of the last bundle
because I couldn't fit everything in
here without it looking bulky I told
myself what I was going to do when I put
it in was I was gonna do doubles which
was I was gonna double - cuz it was it
was it was eight bundles so I was like
okay I'll double three and then I'll
single the rest but it's just my hand is
just definitely not big enough for that
amount of bundles the great thing about
that is that if I ever wanted to squeeze
some more hair or I wanted to redo it or
maybe I have my leave out and I didn't
have a closure and I just kind of wanted
to redo it then it's extra hair that I
can have to just add you know to kind of
make you do with it do but because
closures are a section I can't put I
could so trucks in the closure but it
kind of defeats the purpose of having a
closure in the first place you know it's
just kind of like you should have just
left your hair up if you come today so
yeah um I know that a lot of you guys
were asking me how do I wrap my hair how
do I deal with hair this long and um I
take it off this is a way you guys know
everything that I wear all the hair that
I wear is a wig I've not released any
more because I don't feel like weaves
there - if I want to be red one day or I
want to be red blue and orange and one
day I could with the wig would leave no
that's just not that's not poss
and some days I do feel like changing my
hair eight different times so wigs are
definitely my choice here um the luster
in this hair is beautiful and I didn't
put nothing but a little bit of again
the heat protectant spray which doubles
as a shine but as you can see the shine
in his hair is very natural it's not too
shiny I could make it really shiny but
it's not crazy it still comes off very
natural and it's the the luster is the
same here as it is towards the bottom so
a lot of times when you get hair
SuperDuper long make sure the person is
doing it correctly
I'm sure if I walk down the street with
this thing I'm like you definitely got a
weave you wouldn't just be able to tell
where my we've started or where it ended
you know you could just like okay that's
that's some beautiful hair like I'm aim
is really full too and again I didn't
require eight to ten bundles that is
definitely not a requirement however you
have to remember when you do get longer
hair you cannot buy one bundle
you cannot buy two bundles you can't
even buy three okay especially this long
I would say for at the least because the
hair is because this is Brazilian hair
and Brazilian Indian hair are they're
very fine so the finer the hair the
thinner is going to look so as I'm gonna
turn around here and I'm just going to
talk you cannot see in the back of this
you cannot see my shirt at all okay so
if I see you with 34 inches and I can
see through your hair to your shirt you
bitch you need some more bundles it's
just that simple because I don't care if
you wanted to if you wanted to look
realistic you would not be buying 34
inches so maybe look as realistic as
possible but make sure you have enough
cushion because nobody thin weaves are
epidemic and it's a problem so I would
definitely suggest for maybe three maybe
you can probably get away with three
bundles if you had like a 30-inch
because remember the end are full to
look at look at that
into my hair I'm trying to get on my
tippy-toes so you can see but I can't
cuz it's too long but we'll do this so
look at the ends of my hair and I want
you to see how full they are you see how
everything down here is still full it
people be looking like they got scraggly
ends ain't nothing there because they
don't have enough hair and unfortunately
when you go out or you put your hair
instagraming people be like oh - Slade
and you like no it's portrayed because
that is not how super dooper doesn't
know how you do super duper long hair
you can do what you want to do but I
just don't feel like it makes no sense
there's no rhyme or reason to buy two
bundles of what 34 inches and then you
go ahead unless you're going to layer it
up like 34 30 28 26 like that because
you want it to have a natural layer that
completely I totally get it
but even then you're whenever you buy
SuperDuper long hair make sure that you
get two of the but those long is because
if you do it is still gonna look funny
it may not look terrible but it looks
funny but I have all in one length right
now so everything is working in tandem
here you know you give them Sam
