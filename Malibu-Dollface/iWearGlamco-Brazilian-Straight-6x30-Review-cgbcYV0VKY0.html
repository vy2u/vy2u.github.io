alright god I'm here to do a review for
this hair that I'm rocking right now
which is from a company called I wear
glam this is what the packaging look
like this is what my bundles came in and
this is the package that my closure came
in I have in now I'm gonna be honest
right now I don't know exactly which
origins of hair I have I don't know
about the Parisian straight or the
Brazilian straight but I'm thinking it's
a Brazilian straight I'm not for sure
and I'm just too lazy to look back in my
phone to figure it out yeah I think it's
like I think for a fact is the Brazilian
straight but I'll put I'll post it but
it should be above us dearest so I've
had this hair for about two weeks now I
remember when I first got it I did the
wig for it and then I before I did it I
posted the picture of what the hair well
not actually the hair but the packaging
on Instagram so that you guys could see
so you guys know I've had this style for
quite some time when I updated my hair
for a different company the owner of the
company I believe or is it maybe an
employee I'm not for sure exactly who I
was corresponding them but they asked me
is it possible that I could do this file
with this hair so I'm like you know
because I need to because a lot of you
guys have asked me can you please do a
tutorial on your hairstyle can you
please do so so I did a tutorial using
this hair so it was actually very
perfect again I have in six I have in
six bundles of 30 inch so it's I can't
even get this high because I'm sure
well it's curled so it comes to here I
cut a lot of it because of the style
that I was doing you guys know I told
you like I won't do this particular
style with thin hair or thin wigs
because what happens is it doesn't
really work out too well because it's
not full enough so there's not much of
hair left because you do cut a lot of
hair
off in order to achieve this doubt so if
you are gonna do this after I've after
you watch my tutorial I would suggest
five bundles or more depending on what
look you're trying to do it doesn't have
to be as long but you do want it is full
because this part will not look like
this if you use like three bundles three
or four bundles you're not gonna get
this look at all so um and I also have a
18 inch sub base closure as you guys can
see from them um I will say offhand I'm
a big fan of the hair but I'm not a fan
of the closure by a long shot
um it's just poofy its puffy and I did
everything that I could to get it down
it looks great on camera but I know
throughout the day it won't sustain and
stay like this it'll kind of revert
itself and kind of want to get bigger
again which is something that I don't
like and the reason why I did use their
closure versus my closure store closures
is because they did send it to me and
sometimes when I usually correspond with
the companies I ask them do they have so
base if they have some ways I'm willing
to actually try it um if it's not a
problem with them if they want me to use
your closures I will for this particular
instance they didn't require me to use
it but they send to me just in case I
wanted to so the fact that they you know
sent me you know something that they
could have sold but they said to send me
for free I felt it was only right for me
to actually use it I don't hate it I
just don't love it versus what I'm used
to I'm used to my closures being the
part and the silk based being a little
bit different I will say about this one
versus my other one it was very easy to
sew down it was easier to sew down
because it doesn't have that thick band
around it but you guys know I told you
guys the reason why I like those is
because they last a little bit longer
but it's there's nothing with wrong with
the closure per se I think it's just
more so how it was put in and the way
the hair is put into the closure the way
it was manufactured is what I don't like
it's kind of thick and crowded and it
was a little dry when I received it um
the bundles when I received my bundles
they all came and of course like this
and they were all wrapped with the tag I
am I wear glitter like this and it had
the number of the length that I had so I
had six thirty inches
which I wasn't I didn't remember
requesting that amount but I was
definitely you guys know I love my hair
thick and I love my hair full so if it's
not have you send me more than what I
require that is always a good thing
because I'm gonna figure out try to have
a you know fit him in the hair was very
silky it was very fine but it was full
the wefts are something that I've never
encountered with hair I'm not that I can
remember but their webs are very hard
and when I first start my wigs I like to
put the needle through the weft and then
through the cap to secure it and then I
go around it the rest of the way
yeah my fingers were pretty when I first
did it my fingers were pretty sore um
after I did it because they were so
tough and I really don't like my wife to
be like that however the upside of that
is the fact that these wefts did minimal
to no shedding and I cut all of them so
usually when I cut weft I see a lot of
shedding going on with the hair no
matter if I cut them very nicely I cut
them just whatever I always see
experience a lot of shedding this lasts
about a week or so that I've been
rocking his hair I have not been getting
any shedding when I initially put it in
I was not experiencing any shedding so
it as of right now I'm not experiencing
any shuddhi so that's the thing that I
really do like about this hair is that
the legs aren't exactly my ideal but
they the upside of them I don't know if
it's like silly on them or they just um
they're they're sewn very tightly I
don't know and I really don't care I
just know for a fact that my hair didn't
come out so that's the upside about it
um two of my bundles I noticed that it
had like a weird residue like at the top
of it like where the rubberband was it
was like a weird residue and had like a
little smell to it which I didn't know
what it was so I just rinsed them out
and it seemed like it was fine so I
couldn't really tell you what it was it
wasn't no type of chemical um I'm gonna
kind of chalk that up as maybe the hair
was washed before it was sent to me in
that way once it was you know the it
wasn't all the way dry or whatever
because it was like a little white
residue as I was pulling it apart but
aside from that
no I haven't had any problems this hair
stays it holds a curl these curls I did
today and then they fail bleh
normally if I am out and I curl my hair
with in the morning it'll last me pretty
much if I leave it about 9:00 in the
morning my hair last me about until
about 5:00 5:30 and then it'll start to
really like all the distance starting
with - wanna fall um
but most of the time people are awkward
by then so yeah if you go out on a night
on the town and you create here real
tight and I didn't curl this hair very
very tight because I didn't want to put
a lot of layers in it either so yeah I
like this hair I think they did a very
good job the luster and his hair is very
very very nice as well which I do like
they seem like they do a lot of quality
control because even before I had
reviewed for them I had a few people
that I know of buy their hair and it was
like I really like to say oh you should
review for this company but you guys
know I don't contact companies for hair
reviews they contacted me so I'm gonna
be like oh y'all want to review your
hair
no but they contacted me oh my god well
i'ma see how I like it from a person who
wears a lot of hair this does very is
very virgin okay people it's very much
virgin and it has this it's good quality
their bundles started 74 dollars and
they go up to I think 4 or something so
it just depends on what you want but you
don't have to get this look unless it's
the look you're going for but again I
have six thirty inches okay that's a lot
of hair for the average person and I'm 5
foot 4 so yeah um but yeah if you guys
have any questions make sure you put
them below
shout out to I wear the lamb here they
have a lot of good like client like
celebrity clients Nicki Minaj's wore
their hair little canvas wear their hair
have a nice store so I'll put their
store address down below and I will see
y'all in my next one peace and don't
forget to check out my tutorial on how I
made this well not have made the wig
