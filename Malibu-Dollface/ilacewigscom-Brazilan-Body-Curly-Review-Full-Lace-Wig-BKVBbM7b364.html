that I'm rocking which is a nice like
curly wavy okay just FYI don't mind my
makeup I was I did a different look and
then I reviewed this week while I still
have my same makeup on so yeah I know it
doesn't match for somebody who's gonna
point it out unit so this is another
unit from I lace wigs which it would be
heel so the specs on this puppy so the
hair color is a 1 cuz I was like why is
my hair so ball but yeah this is
definitely a 1 is very Spanish it's 18
inches it's a body body curly which I've
never used
I never heard or use that term before
exercises the medium so that makes sense
why it's a little too big the density is
110 to 120 it's a full lace wig it's
Brazilian virgin hair there is no sub
top there baby hairs along the perimeter
to make it more natural-looking okay so
we're going to start off with wool
inside the box which will these are
little cooler moments and it came of
course in this bag it came with a winged
liner
it's definitely Kappas little bit
lighter it came wrapped in this it came
with this home and it came with two sets
of lashes alright so to how I feel about
it
I like the style I like the color
I actually really like how the lace is
plucked into the unit in the back now
I've bleached this unit the knots of
this unit three times and it did not
take not one time and the other thing
that I was left with was blonde hairs
here and yeah I was wondering like why
I've never had a wig where the knots
wouldn't bleed
and I don't know why they wouldn't but
they would not another thing that I
noticed is that I could not pluck the
hell out of this unit neither it was
just
none of the hairs would come out which
in a sense is a great thing because that
means that your unit will last you
pretty long but it definitely took some
off and usually what I do is when I have
a unit a rather it's a frontal it's a
wig as a closure I'll bleach the nuts
first then I'll pluck it afterwards
because if I plug it afterwards it seems
like the bleach causes the unit to be a
little more easier for me to pluck out
but this one wasn't having it not by a
long shot now as far as the hair goes I
experienced zero shedding from the
actual hair which would make the most
sense because it's like why you can't
pluck it out but it shedding that's just
terrible but no I didn't have any of
those issues as far as shedding those I
put a little bit of water and
conditioner in this and then I didn't
put any curl cream because I feel like
it was not thick enough for me to have
Crow cream then this is the second unit
that they sent me in the first unit I
wasn't too happy with it that's what I'm
kind of so saying they took that kind of
whatever my last one had was like a this
piece and it was like a long piece of
they didn't put him lace so they put the
lace back and um the actual the way the
lace was constructed around was cool the
way that the dividends were put into the
hairline we're cool
I just I'm not a big fan of the way that
the wig just didn't do what it wanted me
to do I have more issues with this week
than I would have liked it and my major
hang-up with this would be again the
density which they told me they up the
density for this um and I just don't see
any difference although my last unit
that I did for them was straight this
unit is all pulled forward so I guess
this would be a natural density for
somebody but it says me it's between 100
and 120 110 to 120 um and this was about
150 I think we would be pretty good cuz
again it's not
terrible it's just not what I would need
especially for the length that it is I
would need it to be a little bit more
fuller because my hair is falling very
flat and it's not even when it's dryer
here at the bottoms it still isn't
giving me more of a bushy natural curl
look it's kind of just there but the
hair itself is very very soft um you
could do a lot with this because there
is lace within the back but you could
definitely throw this up in a ponytail
if you really felt it I'm not one for
that because I don't leave any hair out
in the back
when I get my beehive done so it goes
right up under my neck so if I pull this
up it would literally be lace and hair
it is just it doesn't look natural so
it's not a little natural just nothing
to do it um they seem and I at least
week I'm I'm saying what I think the
problem is with these these particular
units I don't think it's the hair that's
the issue I think it's the wig
construction that's kind of the issue
because it does come with this just a
little straps in the back I don't
believe I have any combs yeah it's
actually a comb here right here in the
back that I could pull it up one of my
Murray um it's a comb in the back and I
don't think that it's terribly bad it
just they need to pay a little bit more
attention to how the hairs are plucked
in because it did have baby hairs but it
definitely the baby hair on it wasn't
realistic meaning it was too long
meaning you would have to go ahead and
cut it and that whole thing so this
would not be a unit that I would
necessarily go to for to do every
Stravaganza look I was told that I look
like I work at the own Airport with this
between the hoodie and the hair but it
is some very pretty hair and it's
Brazilian hair so Brazilian hair it
tends to look very pretty when it's in
its natural state and it's kind of wet
and it got a little water and texture
put to it but I'm just not a big fan of
the wig at all I'm just just not a big
fan and I just want to like like I lace
wigs really bad and maybe three time's
the charm I
no boy guys I'm not a fan I'm not a ham
by a longshot
but yeah I just want to know why I
wasn't able to bleach my hair like it
bleached in some spots but I wouldn't
had to use concealer if it were a bleach
right because I would have been able to
just party freely like I'm able to do my
frontals
or my closures where after I bleached
him all my knots are a nice fleshy scalp
color and I can just you know but this
one just did it didn't it didn't sell me
so again if you guys are interested in
this make sure you guys hit up I last
week and all information for this book
will definitely be below yeah what do
you guys think they could change cuz
maybe the feedback from you guys
well what do you guys think they should
change I showed what the wig looks like
an insight in the beginning of this
video so if you want to refer back to
that feel free and I will catch you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
