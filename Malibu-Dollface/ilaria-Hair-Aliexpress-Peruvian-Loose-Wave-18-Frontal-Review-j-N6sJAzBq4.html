wash my hands
my spies
so lately well in the last couple of
days I've been having like a Cleopatra
coming at you ever since my braids I've
been having like a nostalgia mum with
them so touch a love it's been my chain
so gonna talk about my hair which is
very different from what you guys are
very much used to especially coming from
me so I wanted to try something to push
the envelope a little bit because I do
have a frontal so I just wanted to do
something a little bit different even
though my ears cricket we're here we're
here we can't change what it's already
happened we can only improve on art
mistakes okay alright so my hair is from
an Aliexpress vendor called I believe
it's Luria hair correct me if I'm wrong
but I believe it's Luria hair and I am
wearing their Peruvian loose wave in
four bundles of 22 with a 18 inch arm
frontal oh I've had his hair for far too
long
um and I think it's about time I did my
good overview for it so I decided to do
my hair a little bit different just
because I was planning on wearing these
earrings which I found in my heap of
jewelry I said okay I'll just put on
these big earrings why not
and then this cute is a sweater dress
from mosquito and it had all of the UM
Looney Tunes on it so I decided to put
on good I have them all but I haven't
wore any of them just to get so I
decided this would be a nice contrast
for the background so back to my hair
um I when I did it I had went ahead and
laid my frontal down which my frontal
video should be up this week on how I
blue gel mine's down but if you are
tired of waiting ivy has one up as well
as fabulosity is me also has one up I'll
link those below if you're interested um
so I went ahead in um glooty down and
then I was pulling the top of it because
this is how this is the original texture
of the actual hair but I have helped it
some way so I just thought I decided to
put like a nice loose braid right here
in the middle um I'm feeling very like
70s inspired
with a little bit of 90s I don't know I
was just you know and then my lashes I
found these
I had these decided to do something new
contact so you know somebody's gonna ask
these contacts are from lens got me and
these are the silica um since I can't
remember what color this is we're gonna
just put them right here uh so that's
what color these are so if you guys are
interested I will definitely put the
link to these below as well so what i
did was i went ahead and braid in my
hair in a very loose um braid going back
and then i just bobby pin the back um
and then let it fall like the rest of
the curl now this is their loose way
their loose wave came like this but
after I washed it I went ahead I
bleached my frontal after I did that
then the hair got a little bit on the
not so super when I received it looked
like this this is what it looked like so
I thought went ahead and co washed and
washed and then bleach my frontal I
noticed that my hair was uh it wasn't as
curly but I liked with the original
texture look like so I just went ahead
and took my curling iron which is my
Remington one that I love so much and I
believe it's like the 1/4 barrel and I
went ahead and just curl the bottom of
this so that's what and then put some
flexi rods in it so that's why it's you
know so springy and I left the top more
of it's not straight but it definitely
has a bit of a nice little wave to it so
I have more of a natural look at this
and look like my hair is to put together
but it still looks together yeah um so I
love this frontal to depth this is by
far my favorite front that I've gotten
from any company so far so that is a one
plus plus plus because it looks super
duper natural was easy to bleach it was
easy to lay down um my hair was supposed
to have been parted like from here to
here so this section decision right here
should have been in my brain but it
ain't but you know life hat life happens
things happen oh my god is that a bobby
pin why is it down here
oh this is a clip so far I've had this
hair for I believe since like I want to
say March it's going on and a lot of you
guys have asked how long do I keep my
hair whenever I'm contracted to do a
review of any sort to always keep the
hair for at least two months so within a
two-month period the company will
receive their review so that two months
gives me an opportunity to test it out
as much as I would like without being
rushed for review and it gives me time
to see if I really like it or I dislike
it because this was a texture that I was
a little bit different because it is
kind of straight here but it is more of
the wave of it at the bottom is here um
I did experience some shedding um it
wasn't crazy I didn't have the NAP balls
and as you can see it's really you know
it's springy and nice now but at the
time when I first received it because it
was so tight it wasn't doing this so
what I did was I did what I always do I
took my favorite trusted made
conditioner put in some conditioner let
it sit and then once it's it it kind of
relaxed a little bit and then once it
relaxed I went back and just barrel
curled it because it still has a curl at
the bottom will a wave at the bottom
it's just more so not as wavy as I
wanted it to be so I went ahead and sit
out a little bit
um and curled the bottoms now as far as
the tangling goes I am NOT experiencing
any of that and I haven't got any of it
tangling or matting of any sorts thank
God it was just the shedding had to kind
of subside a little bit and I did cut
the West on this so that could be
probably the reason maybe if you don't
cut your tongue lips
I just wanted my install to be super
flat and that's what I got um so I did
not fold these I definitely um cut these
and I did them like I do all my wigs if
you guys are interested in how I make my
wigs I will link that video below for
you as well um color I when I bleached
my frontal I did accidentally bleach
some of the frontal in the front so um
that was I did my of course my regular
scratch strand test
but idea bleach a little bit of my
personal which eventually got plucked
out because I did go ahead and use my
nice pink um tweezers and I pluck but
you know the front of the frontal so I
could give me this nice natural look
versus having that boxed up look because
this was one of those frontals I
remember was not plucked it was very
much Barbie and in the wrong way so I
remember pluck eNOS and I plucked quite
a bit of hair out of this one however it
did end up being something that I
thought was very great because it does
look very natural here in the front it
doesn't look boxed up or anything like
that so that's the great part about this
now as far as keeping my hair to stay
like this what I would have to do like
in a regular day wearing this what I
have to do is I would have to make sure
that my hair is really really really
conditioned to make sure that it would
stay springy with in the heat because
summers is you know it's about to be
over in the heat and I make sure that it
will not um dry out so my hair is super
duper soft as you can see it's like a
pillow it's super duper felt soft and
what I was able to do to keep it this
off was once I conditioned it and I
curled it I curled it would absolutely
positively nothing in it so don't put no
hairspray in it don't put anything as
you curl it once you finish curling it
then you take a little bit of a really
good flexing hold spray then you put it
in it and you just kind of let it sit on
the hair don't take a piece and spray
the hair because then your hair is going
to get crunchy and it's not going to
want to do this when all is said and
then it's not going to want to stay so
as you can see here this one felt a
little bit more versus the rest of this
so this is why this isn't as curly is it
but it doesn't matter because my hair is
not meant to look perfect it's not meant
to look but you know it's supposed to
look like I just have this nice curly
hair that I'm kind of loving you know
well as far as my frontal goes my
frontal I love so it goes from ear to
ear
I glued it down somewhat on inside but
not all the way just because I knew I
wasn't you wouldn't be able to see it
but it actually is down on the side my
sideburns because they're definitely
growing back it's really really nice the
only downside of this that I would give
is the shedding and then of course it
eventually it stopped um and again it
could have definitely been because of me
cutting my lips but I just cannot not do
that if I want a really flat install I
don't care what nobody says I've seen
other people do it and it just doesn't
look right without me cutting them
because I needed to lay flat plus I
single at the back so again I have four
bundles so I was able to fit all four
bundles I probably have that much hair
left and I didn't need it you know I
still wanted it to be flat I put most of
the hair in the back so and then because
it's hair is not SuperDuper flat it also
gives me an opportunity for the hair to
kind of be as well maybe as full as I
would like it without looking like it's
crowded
um so I'm gonna give y'all a - only
because of the shading issue um what I
put color cuz I know somebody's gonna
ask what I put color on this hair no
only because I would hate to take out
the pattern but I just feel like because
of the chrome pattern at the bottom this
hair says virgin Peruvian but I don't
think that this hair always - you guys I
don't think that the hair is virgin it
says it is version but in order no
virgin hair is dis inconsistent when it
comes down to hair when you see a person
who has really curly hair the hair is
either curly from the root down if it's
virgin now if they don't put some color
in there they can flat ironed a curl
pattern out then it could be seven
different versions so if it's kind of
loser here and then here cuz it looks
like what happened is I had straight
hair and then I curled it which kind of
happened but trust me though the loose
wave is pretty loose but it eventually
falls when you first get it your hair
probably looks something like this then
once you wash it is going to eventually
start to fall and then you don't have to
give miss curlers out but I'll give him
the a - only because I don't know if the
shedding is was my issue or if it was
their issue but I'm just
say it was their issue only because I
have had hair that I've done that with
and I haven't experienced that guys are
interested in Gloria's hair make sure
you guys hit the links below shout out
to the company for being very patient
with me I wanted to make sure that I can
give you guys because usually when I
start giving people aids I want to make
sure it's really a and it's not a F so
they're fine
I am wearing the Peruvian loose wave and
I'm wearing four bundles of 22-inch and
I am wearing a 18 inch frontal so hit
the links below and I will catch y'all
in my next one thing mmm
Oh see you later purse</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
