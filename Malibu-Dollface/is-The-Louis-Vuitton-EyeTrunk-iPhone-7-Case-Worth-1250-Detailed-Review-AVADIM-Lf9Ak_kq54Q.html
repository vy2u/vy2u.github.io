somebody's going to point it out that I
did not put up a video yesterday so I'm
going towards the end of the month we
doubling up on days and I'm kind of
missing it's just that I'm going to miss
them doing a lot right now so excuse me
but I asked you guys earlier today on
Instagram did you want me to do a review
for this Louboutin case that y'all are
going crazy about in the comments and
accent me about all over my social media
platforms so ah it was an astounding yes
and I just didn't know what people
really wanted to know because you know I
do something that's like luxury or
expensive you got people in the comments
well I just personally wouldn't buy that
and that's the why ain't nobody
went to your channel to watch overview
about what the you wasn't gonna buy
so before we get started if you would
not purchase this item I don't want to
hear about why in the comments okay girl
just stick to what you know to do what
you do this ain't for you me I almost
like severed my whole finger the other
day so tender but Mindy and the reason I
want to do this is because a lot of
times when we buy expensive items you
always wonder was it really worth the
money
oh I a little bit universe no I love a
good backstory so I was in the mall you
guys if you were from the valley or you
visited on you know that there's a mall
Club it's a painting the web still
Topanga Canyon mall and that mall like
all the luxury stores right at the
bottom so it's like Tory Burch Louboutin
a diamond is two stories it's a lot of
well-known places that are at the bottom
so I'm walking past the time to go to
Neiman's and I see the model and she's
like is her that's another girl and she
like this and I'm like because only I
could see was just this part which was
all of the detail and then just this
this
and it was this particular one it wasn't
with my wallet home wasn't the one that
looks like it was this is a reverse one
this is the regular monogram so I'm like
oh bitch I went in it why didn't go into
that when I actually was like okay I'm
gonna ask about a little bit later
because I was thinking I was under the
impression that the case is going to be
like maybe $600 here that's not what
happened so I ended up going from there
all the way to Santa Monica
total opposite sides in town and then at
that one I have went in and I trusted to
grow that is because I usually go
someone in Santa Monica to buy like
wallets and stuff
so she was like yeah we've got a lot of
people Consol's I'm you know the good
word that went up we got a lot of people
calling they were you know part of the
shooters did you see the runway for the
season I said I did I follow it on
Instagram so I did see them but I didn't
pay too much mind just because it was
more about the clothes and it was about
the phone cases and in the runway they
had like these um I would sit here you
know you get luggage and it had like the
key and it's like the key holder that
goes over it it was kind of like that
but it was for your headphones all that
oh girl this I have got to get this case
so she was like tweak we do you want to
put in a pre-order so my girls are all
thinking how much is gonna be she was
like whoa what kind of phone be here I
said I have the iPhone 6 plus
she saw her well that one will be 1295 I
was like and what exactly does the case
do again like come against us okay so Oh
as you can see I ended up buying it so
I'll put in a pre-order before we even
get to this I'm going to say this a lot
of guys who ask me where you can buy
them my local louboutin store actually
has some but they're in for the 7 not
the 7 plus so you might want to either
pre-order I don't know if they're going
to reissue these I'm not really short
from around here it was like a one-time
deal and then whatever they sale and
they don't have they're not going to
sell anymore
to make any more like a you know that
limited quality type of thing which a
lot of high-end designers like to do
okay so the to the case itself it came
and the Newlands the time by I'm back
which I really like and they come with
the blue but this is what is it's like
an orange e color I would like this
combination it looks really good that's
why they change my background cuz I'm
gonna make a grade but I feel like why
not so when you get it it comes in a
Louboutin box like this but then it also
comes with the thank-you card that they
always give you and then it comes also
with your receipt in the inside of this
as well so then you go ahead and undo
they do this where they tie it so you
know nobody can steal your stuff while
you were at H&amp;amp;M and shoot so key ones do
that is with this box and then it comes
with the music on logo and it's involved
it's not just printed on and then so
much wind in cloth that comes with it
actually has a little baton like
embossed on the actual cloth and then
when you open it it says Louboutin again
and then it has this extra paraphernalia
in it and then it comes with the actual
so there is no like box box what it is
is it's like this styrofoam if I start
off on my fifth and then it comes with a
fake iphone dummy just to kind of show
you how it would look white in there and
then obviously the phone's the case is
set in the inside like this place so
when you open it it looks like this and
these are just two pieces of styrofoam
so once you get it it's going to look
like this with no phone in it so it has
the detail of the reverse monogram on
the back so if you do get one from like
a second ten person like screenshot this
or you know that it's real so the top
loop
cutoff right over the phone thing and it
should only be one it should not be
eight of these it should not be small
and it should not be a whole bunch of
other stuff that don't look like this
okay and then so then in the inside of
it right here at the bottom it says as
you can see seven plus and then it has a
serial code that is right here see there
there's a serial code right there
Louis Vuitton parrot made in Italy right
and smack dab in the middle of this
puppet so how this works is you take the
this piece and it's coat is this is made
this is their trunk case I don't even
think I said that but this is based on
the Louboutin trunk the classic Trump's
we've seen all our damn life so you take
the bottom part of the trunk case you
take it and you slide it into here then
you take this part and you slide it in
there and it's going to snap and this
actually fastens it and keeps it on keep
it from the falling it will keep it
together like that it's really more so
for decoration but it does snap I will
say that and it doesn't come loose or
anything like that like I could do this
now all of these functionality of this
actually works so this but these buttons
on the side are my volume rockers and
what does this one do oh this is my home
the sleep button and I don't remember
what this one does
I don't think this one does anything at
all at the bottom but this one is
definitely to turn my phone on and all
the button right here that's a little
bit bigger than the rest of them and it
turns the volume on and also it looks
like one of these but it actually is a
functional button that you can use
that's why it's a little bit more space
between these two than it is on that
side this one and like I said the
reverse monogram so again this is the
classic monogram this is the reverse one
what I wanted to do know you
well what I wanted to do was I wanted to
buy this one and then this one and just
change the top and this but the
difference is the one that actually is
the reverse one like this one it doesn't
have the gold hardware is black so it
wouldn't match anyway which kind of
sucks Louboutin so to the big question
is it worth the $1,200 and I'm going to
give you a simple answer by saying
absolutely not it is not worth the money
by a long shot
however what I will say is a very
well-made case and my phone is already a
bit more heavy because it's a 607 plus
but this case I mean yeah this case
makes it much heavier because so it has
a very stream is a very well build to it
it's just not $1200 worth it but what
you're paying for is the quality of the
case which I would say if I had to mark
the quality how much they pay for the
all the hardware on this I would say
this case probably costing about $300 to
make however they marked it up because
it is Louboutin so you have to keep that
in mind they do however you know they so
fix a lot of you guys in platters I got
me a fake one it doesn't rattle or
anything when I shake it
everything moves like it's supposed to I
did however drop it and I don't know
this is a smear yeah so at the bottom
here I got a couple of stuffs here at
the bottom as you can see right there
I've scuffed it there and then it's a
back because I lay the phone down like
when I'm like sitting somewhere I'll lay
down so that means the highest point of
this little lock piece right here it
kind of wears off a little bit in the
back which is hard to see but it's right
here where the LV is it's kind of
starting to turn a little bit it's hard
to see on camera um and then you're
going to knit these corners you are I
did this one oh yeah I got this one good
so this one right here right there I
dropped it it was in my when I have my
my limber everyone was sitting in the
pocket and then I bent over because the
Nottie decided she wanted to act stupid
and then it fell out and then it hit the
concrete so yeah um if you what I
suggest buying this case okay yes - no
yes if you are a person who love
designers yes if you love lose the time
yes if you are a person like me do not
like them Graham on my cases that lose
the time like to make which fold open
and you can put credit cards in there
and and you little roll this up if you
don't like those you just wanted
something that had more of a fashionable
state to it and it's a very good
statement piece then I would say and you
have the money okay I don't think people
know I don't buy anything like this any
luxury items or anything like this
unless my bills are paid in full not the
minimum balance but everything is paid
this is play money this is not money
that I use and I'm digging into my
savings or digging into my Cardinal
money in order to buy something like
this this was money I had just to play
with and I decided to buy this because I
wanted it to match my wallet plus I
thought the cake was really dope I had
never seen anything like this before if
you are a person who drops your a
lot know if you have children who play
games on your phone know if you want to
buy it to floss on your friends but then
you don't have a car know if you are a
person who just does not know anything
or have any background in loose Vuitton
you just want to buy it - some people
didn't know because again the case
itself is nice but if you don't have a
very good phone to put this muzzles on
the end I don't I don't suggest it an ER
from what I understand they only have it
for the 7 and 7 blood so yeah is it
worth the money
no is it a very nice taste very much yes
if you have the extra money to buy it
and you just want to sure a lot of
people on will be like I would never pay
so much for an item where this Louboutin
this you know that before I go let me
just say this about luxury item because
you guys know I have a lot of here
the great thing about this is when I
paid was full price for this case when I
no longer want this case anymore
is it do regardless of the stings and
all the that I put on it I can
easily sell this case back to a
consignment store who will buy this off
of me and give me about 80% of my money
back and I will not be left with just a
case so it's very different than buying
an Amazon case and you buy for about two
or three dollars you know when you throw
it to the side throw it in the drawer
and you forget about it so that's the
great thing about this all types of
luxury items your girlfriend has a lot
of Chanel purses just sitting around and
she no longer wears them she could
literally sell those to a consignment
store you guys could buy a new house so
this is a bit of an investment but you
can always resell authentic luxury items
and get most of your money back
especially if they're still held in
really great condition so again like I
said a lot of you guys were asking I got
my semi local or a Maluku as delivered
on in Santa Monica but any Luther
Louboutin retailer I was just there the
other day because I brought another
wallet they wanted to show you guys and
they had them in a display case so they
had one that was all gold it's not the
one does like the gold a mirror it's not
that one it's like this it has the movie
baton but it's all gold I don't know
they're gonna release those later or
that was just for the runway because
they had a red one too and then they
have one from the Louboutin supreme
collection so if you have two interested
in this case it is a Louboutin
definitely did not prepare me for old is
okay and give me a nickel so if you guys
are interested in this case
check your local louboutin store any I
like a luxury snob VIP consignments a
lot of those are reputable places who
sale stuff items like such and I will
catch you guys in my next one have any
questions about this or whatever let me
know and I will put I will answer them
below catch you guys in my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
