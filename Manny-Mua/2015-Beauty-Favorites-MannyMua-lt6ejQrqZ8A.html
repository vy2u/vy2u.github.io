excited to be filming this let's go get
into the 2015 beauty favorites as always

you guys do like this video I think you

and subscribe to my channel if you
aren't already and if you knew what is
up Manny Manny acts that's all you gotta
know cool let's go and get into the
Savior's video
cool so the first three items are gonna
be more like skincare e type items not
skincare necessarily just more like that
are not makeup these are the three items
that are not makeup in this video so
first things first I want to talk about
because I mean I just have to talk about
this I talked about this in a favorites
video a while back I don't remember
which one it was but I still get so many
like tweets about it this is the Sarah
hat lips lip just sleep lit mask that's
not easy for it I actually hit like the
bottom of it already because it is so
good it's a very very dense it's very
very thick which is why I only use at
nighttime I mean use in the day of
course if you want to oh go for it man
but it is very thick and it's kind of
like the goopy in a way that's a weird
word I put this on it at my time and
then I wake up and I still have some of
it on which is why I like it so much I'm
like yo I know my lips are getting
hydrated with this so Sarah have lips
lip amazing you guys probably doesn't be
talking about this this is the Korres
Greek yogurt nourishing sleeping facial
it is a Greek yogurt based sleeping
hydrating mask you can see I've like I'm
almost hitting pad on that one -
I'm almost at the bottom of the jar I
actually love this it's very very
hydrating it is a sleep mask what I like
to do is how I'll go and wash my face
put on a moisturizer or whatever and
then I do this at the very end of every
step and I wake up every morning after I
use this and I my skin feels so hydrated
so plump that Greek yogurt is very
very hydrating like so good and it's not
too hydrating where it's gonna clog my
pores I don't feel like it is at least
it's definitely hydrating enough where I
feel a difference but it's not clogging
my pores you know when these things that
are way too hydrating it'll clog your
pores because I have I've used products
that are like - nourishing and I'm like
yo my pores a cloud that I'm
breaking out so this does not jet to me
and I absolutely love it I would
definitely recommend it get a sample
from Sephora so balm and last skin care
you type item or a skincare just last
not beauty item this is Cooper II I've
talked about this into another favorites
video I don't remember which one but I
got it and I'm obsessed this is
basically spray like literally as
 spray you like open the toilet you
spray it on the top of the water it
creates a little film your falls in
and and then the film envelops the
shitty you cannot smell the in the
bathroom it's really really really cool
it's very very unique very innovative
why didn't I think of that
this is public genius is probably a
multi-million dollar thing now because
it is so this is good
literally I take you to travel with me
all the time and how my friends
appreciate it when I should at their
house and yet they can't smell it so the
next time I want to talk about what the
morphe Elite brushes I just grab three
that are right next to me I have two
favorite Martin videos up on my channel
already I'll leave a link down below if
you're curious about any morphe brushes
honestly though the morphe elite
collection brushes I wanted them to have
a little extra love in this video
because they are truly the best brushes
for the best price point I mean I can
say like Haku hodo and like freaking
NARS brushes are amazing which they are
but the price point is like $60 a brush
these are like in the teens and twenties
like how much these cost and the quality
is just as good if not better than the
Haku photo and NARS ones they're
absolutely amazing so I'm not gonna go
into detail about which brushes I left
so much in this video but I trying to
give an extra left to the morphe elites
they are the best brushes I'm not
kidding so bomb check them out I also
have a coat of morphe Mannie mooing
all-caps boom
I'm an affiliate with them I love them
as a brand my next video is also from
morphe it is the morphe 35o it is such a
beautiful palette I died so I'm
not done after toriel using this yet
this palette is seriously like sells
like hotcakes with marthy it is so
popular I always let you guys know when
it's back in stock when I find out it is
I like this palette is better than all
the other palettes a lot of people will
use a morphe palettes and they are nice
don't get me wrong they're nice palette
but the 35 most specifically I feel is
nicer it doesn't really make sense I
feel like they're more pigmented they're
more blendable they're more everything
like literally like super pigmented
super blendable let me just swatch them
is this a joke
or not so I just had to give the morphe
35o some love I will be filming a
tutorial on if you guys want to see one
I know I talked about it all the time I
just haven't filmed the full blown
tutorial with it yet if you guys still
want to see one let me know and I'll
totally someone I truly do love this
palette and I think it's better than
although the palettes that they have
3500
obsess next part I have to talk about
which has been my life off dozen 15 is
benefit hoola bronzer you guys know you
 know that I use this bitch in
like every single tutorial I'm wearing
today
we surprised don't think so it's just my
favorite bronzer because it is a very
neutral it's not too too too cool it's
not too warm it is just a nice bronzer
for shading in the face if your lighter
complexion medium a compassionate medium
dark in complexion it's going to
probably work for you once you're
getting into like the deeper deeper skin
tones like then c-45 status I don't
think it will work for you maybe it's
like a setting powder even the packaging
is adorable
it's like bamboo ish too little box I
don't know I love it I think it's an
amazing product my favorite mascara of
this year I'm not going an order I hope
you guys know that I'm not gonna be
going in like a specific like I'm gonna
do primer first and I know he'll know I
want to be the sporadic won't you guys
to like see my so my parent my
Sierra is also by benefit it does be
roller lash this has been my trust 15
mascara like and it will probably my
2016 1 2 it is so amazing it's stupid
it's just a really great risk right
because I feel like it's very
lightweight and it doesn't drop your
curl and actually helps keep your lashes
curl - my mom is hooked to it my hand is
up to it I'm like everyone in my life
obsessed with the roller lash for great
reason it is literally like the best
mascara I've ever tried I'm not even
kidding
I love the wand I love how you can
literally like hook underneath your
bottom lashes and like jiggle it up her
wiggle trailer wiggle jiggle and wiggle
over the same thing whatever basically
the same if you guys can and go to
Sephora and check it out I know they
have a mini one in like that mini Travel
section like it's like 10 bucks it's
like much cheaper than like this one I
think is like 20 something but it is
like the best mascara I've ever tried
I'm not kidding it is so bomb so lots of
highlighters I would talk about the two
highlighters that I have been loving
each other 15 it's just they are the
best
it is the Laura Geller gilded honey like
this highlighter is pure gold do you see
them intense reflection like I love an
intense ask reflecting highlight you
guys know this I'm like highlighting
Queen obsessed gold highlighters were
really really in in 2015 and I think
Laura Geller was one of the ones I
really helped to push that along and a
lot of brands started coming out with
more golden intense reflecting
highlighters I mean whisper of gold was
like the first like woah kind of a
golden highlighter but laura geller
really hoped take that into control and
 run with the gold the other
highlighter I want to talk about really
quickly I'll be surprised doubtful
champagne pop so I want to talk about
Becca champagne pop it is the
collaboration color with Jaclyn hill
honestly I think this highlighter is
absolutely amazing and yes Jacqueline's
one of my closest friends but I doesn't
that I'm like loving it because of her
that's super dishonest you know what I
mean I would never talk about a product
I don't love and I think champagne pop
has been such an amazing color it's so
universal and I think that's why it's
done so well it's great on light skin
it's great on deeper complexions it's
absolutely stunning it is a very just
gorgeous champagne golden color laura
geller right here a chef a pop right
here so they're absolutely stunning
actually you love both of those
highlighters they have been such staples
I mean champagne pop broke records
inside Sephora like I'm not just talking
about it because Jacqueline's my friend
it is truly an amazing product Becca
highlighters are some of the best in the
entire market and gilded honey was
 sold out for how long how long
it took me so long to get this I like
what's on Ulta site like try to
like get like a theme to trying
to buy that like so hard to get but
these are the two highlighters that I've
been loving for 2015 next time I'm
grabbing is the Kat Von D shade + light
pod this is my top contour palette of
all the palettes that came out there are
so many I feel like Anasazi Beverly
Hills really started that trend too when
doing like the contour palettes and they
became so freakin popular formula wise
and color wise this one is seriously
just hands down to me it's just the best
one I absolutely love this product I hit
pan on the freaking under-eye
highlighting one it's such a good
highlight color I love the contour color
as well it's a very cool toned Brown
bronzer color I use actually these are
the four I use I use all four of these
on the daily these ones I don't really
touch as much but these will I use all
the time powders are very very smooth
it's very lightweight but it still gives
you so much pigment to it which I love
and if you guys are looking for a great
contrapositive egg for your buck because
you do get a lot of products in here as
well check out the Kat Von D shade +
light it is phenomenal moving lots of
top to foundations that I've been loving
in 2015 this one was really hard for me
to pick just - I was like yo like I
can't just like for like that's
ridiculous so I chose two foundations
that literally like spoke to me in 2015
the first one is the Loreal Pro matte
infallible this is my third tube of it
which is why I have to talk about it
honestly I love the Loreal Pro matte
infallible especially for like a
drugstore foundation that's not
expensive it's like 9 bucks ebooks
it's mattifying it lasts all day on the
skin medium to full coverage so
blendable i can go running on about this
one
but you guys know that this is one of my
favorite foundations and I've been
loving it honestly if you guys are
looking for a really great drugstore
foundation that is not gonna break the
bank but still high-quality Loreal Pro
matte infallible
I'm obsessed I'm in the shade 103
natural buff on the other spectrum of
foundations my absolute number one
favorite of the 2015 year is the dior
air flash foundation it has changed my
foundation game it is my top right
foundation I know it's so excessive to
say that it is my top or foundation this
is the my top layer foundation I'll do
like a base layer and I did this as my
top layer but I do that because well one
I'm saving a little bit of product
because I'm not using that much
foundation it's just going on my top
it's not like it's gonna be like my full
base and - it gives you the most
beautiful skin like appearance it's like
a full covered version of skin it has
crushed pearlized pigments in it which
is why it gives you more weight if a
luminous skin like appearance for me
whatever I'm using it I don't put it in
the t-zone though I only put it on the
outer perimeters of my face like on my
cheeks on my forehead things like that
because I do get oily and I don't want
to emphasize not worthinesse with a
luminous foundation this is
expensive as bug-like it is so it's like
60 bucks and everyone in body knows oh
god the door is expensive I will forever
keep buying it because it is the most
beautiful foundation I've ever tried I
like to spray a kabuki brush with it
specifically this brush by morphe it's
the e6 spray it on and just Pat it on
top pack it on in its standing I'm gonna
shade 300 in this one so those are my
two top foundations of 2015 so my top
concealer of 2015 is definitely the
Naked skin concealer by urban decay this
concealer just hit the beauty
world and it hit it so hard
everyone had loved it when they tried it
the reason why I like it so much is
because it is full coverage it's
lightweight and it's kind of hydrating
it's not like the most drying concealer
I've ever tried it's not dry under my
eyes
I do get Creasy like crazy underneath my
eyes I always tell you guys that and I'm
like cool I'm just I'm
it's so blendable it's so pigmented it's
full coverage it's a lightweight
consistency and honestly I didn't give
this an honorable mention really quickly
I just got this but let me give you an
arm over mentioned okay so this is the
Make Up For Ever Ultra HD concealer
which is another concealer that I have
been loving but for the past two months
it's kind of hard for me to put this
into the 2015 beauty favorites video
I've only been using it for two months
but I've been using it religiously
non-stop and it is a beautiful medium to
full coverage a little bit goes a very
long way it's also very hydrating
underneath the high it's not cakey you
don't have to set it right away for it
to like not crease on you it's so nice
it doesn't crease very easily I can see
that's built for 4k definition which is
like Hello 4 x 1080 bitch weird so my
top favorite powder of the year is
always surprise it is the Laura Mercier
translucent powder this powder has
changed my game if I'm slapping an ass
like mmm I just feel like this powder
has really changed my makeup game it has
kept me mad throughout the day it gives
me a full Ollis appearance which I mean
I'm into a flawless appearance look not
gonna lie the way I like to use this is
actually I'll grab a powder puff and
I'll put it in the areas that I get
really really oily an excessive amount
of the powder actually I don't put a lot
on my cheeks and the t-zone and then
I'll brush it off with a different
foundation powder preferably like a very
lightweight like HD powder because I
don't want to like too much powder on my
face because I don't look like a
powder ball but I just noticed that when
I'm using this before I do that step it
really does keep my makeup on a lot
longer with what I do now when I go to
events and things like that
I need my makeup to last me like 12
hours I need it to look beautiful all
day and the Laura Mercier translucent
powder really helps me with that it
truly does make me matte and keep me
looking like pretty throughout the day I
know that sounds kind of like vain and
weird but if you want makeup and you try
this powder you know what I'm talking
about like it does really keep your
makeup on a lot longer than other
powders do and if you are oily this will
be your best friend if you're dry that's
debatable you know I'm saying because
dry people powders are like not their
friend and you know you're just not into
the powder at all because it is gonna
dry you out I'm gonna take moisture from
your skin but if you're oily like me
you're gonna love it I swear to you it
is the best powder get a step-over from
Sephora I'm all about samples clearly
I'm a sample bitch so if you guys want
to try it out check it out at Sephora or
any other beauty store that's Laura
Mercier so let's go talk about an
eyeliner that I've been loving for 2015
it is my top eyeliner this is the
England 77 gel liner this liner killed
all the bitches in my drawer in my liner
drawer this said off bitch got a
knife slay them all because this is
literally the best pilot I know
ever tried one it is so dark is black is
black it's like frickin the night sky
and then it stays put all day the
problem with me is that I kind of have
like oily ish lids so like after about
like six hours that'll chance for a
little bit but I'm oily can't help it
but I notice that with any other liner
compared to this one this one is the
best one with longevity I like to mix it
with the inglot duraline which is the
mixing medium that's like the best thing
I'm also discovered to use this with it
it creates more of a liquidy consistency
and it still is black it still has long
lasting just a lot easier to work with
because this is a gel formula and
sometimes people have a hard time using
gels so if you guys are looking for a
great eyeliner that is just high-quality
gonna stay on your eyes all day check
out the England 77 Jo liner so the next
product I'm gonna talk about is a liquid
lipstick this I may be a little biased I
might be a little bit biased not gonna
lie and this is serenity by Gerard
cosmetics and myself I collab with dark
cosmetics earlier this year and created
a liquid lipstick with them this is a
Hydra matte liquid lipstick it is called
serenity it is the most perfect pinky
warm nude color let me swatch it on my
hand right here gorgeous warm pink it is
stunning I love this shade I love the
formula the formula is very thin but
very pigmented and it's not too drying
which is like a big problem for a lot of
people they don't like super drying
liquid lipsticks serenity was my first
ever collaboration and I think it's so
amazing and I can never I'll never not
love this shade a lot of people have
been like tagging me recently because
they're getting surrending during like
the holidays and I'm so happy you guys
like it and I'm so happy that I turned
out as Bob as you guys were hoping you
would be so thank you so much for all
the positive feedback and love I almost
want to put it on on top of this I'm
just gonna put surrounding on top just
mix them why not why not makeup has no
 rules
sounds like vanilla so this one looks
like on top of the lip I just had it
just made a little bit more new deliver
more pinky a little bit more neutral
that's definitely in my top 2015 liquid
lipstick I am biased towards it not
gonna lie and I don't give a lashes
let's talk about my favorite pair of
lashes from 2015 do we know I think we
do new bounce um
just in the style Bella Bella lashes are
basically like my favorite style of
lashes they're very flared and they're
very wispy and they curled upwards which
is why I can wear glasses with them a
lot people ask me how I wear glasses
with lashes it's because the lashes I
wear are usually 3d mink and they flip
upwards so it doesn't go straight out
like usual lashes do it literally goes
like this and stuff like an eyelash me
like this how do I think like this I
still have space between my lens and my
lashes but this is what they look like
they're a very just beautiful wispy pair
I think eyes are familiar with the Lily
lashes in mikonos they are the same
exact style I think they're made at the
same lab like literally that style is my
favorite lifestyle like mikonos Bella
they're my favorite kind of lashes they
are amazing new bounce um I'm definitely
with them if you use my codename ey you
save 20% off they're my favorite
affiliate for lashes because they do
give off 20% to my followers that is
super awesome a lot of brands don't do
that most of the brand's I work with
when I was doing lashes with other
brands they only gave up 10% that's good
- I mean it's still you get a percent
off like that's awesome but you about
something you get 20 so I'm like 10 20 I
just wanted to give some love to my
favorite kind of shadows from 2015 it is
the makeup geek foiled shadows you guys
honestly if you haven't tried the makeup
geek foiled shadows you need to get some
they are so great so high-quality my two
favorites from their entire line are in
the spotlight and grandstand they are
the best shades ever grandstand is like
a very bronzy warm tone it's like a very
reflective bronze shade I just watched
it right now next to serenity it's this
color here it's stunning and in the
spotlight is a beautiful like champagne
whitish pink very intense very effective
is absolutely stunning those two shades
are my favorite makeup geek foiled
shadows that they never made they're
actually amazing well honestly that's a
lie they are one of my favorites but my
favorite absolute favorite makeup
eyeshadow that they've ever made is in
my talent with makeup geek so that one
you have to stay tuned for I just watch
it and show you guys this is my favorite
shade I mean just swatch them at the
very end that's mine right here it's a
very beautiful topi bronze shade I'm not
gonna tell you the name yet I'm not
gonna tell you any I'm gonna be strong
they're very very high in pearlized
pigments what's actually the ingredient
we're missing for my palate which is why
it's been taking so long
so that's why I love it those ones so
much the foiled shadow that I'm a geek
it's not best hands down
Bom Sailor Moon I'll punish you and last
thing I really want to talk about a
couple of brands that do liquid
lipsticks that are my favorite liquid
lipsticks so the two other formulas that
really jumped out at me in 2015 like
throughout the whole entire year not
just like the end of it or just the
beginning it throughout the entire year
have been B Jeffrey started liquid
lipsticks and at the dose of colors
liquid lipsticks I love I think honest
hacia ones are actually amazing as well
and the ultra ones I love the Ophir
liquid lipsticks but these ones truly
have been like whoa like catching my
attention so much I just love the
packaging I love the formulas of both of
them they're absolutely amazing actually
the packaging on both them is like
almost identical it's really funny I'm
gonna be doing a dose of colors liquid
lipsticks swatch video I've already done
a Jeffrey one I absolutely love it look
at the packaging it's literally
identical and then they also both have
the huge ass-fucking doe foot applicator
that's the size of a doe foot
ridiculous and those are - my favorite
liquid lipstick brands besides no friend
besides uh Nastasia but these ones
really really like took my attention
like by storm they feel me and that is
if my entire 2015 beauty favorites I had
so much fun filming this video I love
doing videos like this you guys already
know that favorites videos every month
are my favorite I'm just really happy
that you guys still wanted me to do it I
know I did just recently do a favorites
