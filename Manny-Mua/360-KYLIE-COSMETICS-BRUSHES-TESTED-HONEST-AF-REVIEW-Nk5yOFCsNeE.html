today's video I have not seen I've not
been tagged more than I have ever to do
a review on something that I have for
today's video these are the infamous
Kylie cosmetics 360 dollar brushes holy
shit that price point you guys when I
first saw the price point on Twitter
because people are like tweeting it like
holy fuck what the fuck what you
thinking like what the fuck what's going
on because it was 16 brushes for three
hundred and sixty dollars I was taken
aback I'm not gonna lie how I saw that
and I was like oh baby like I was truly
shook from the bottom of my fucking
heart the thing is I guess for me
because it's like I'm so close with
morphe I've been working with more three
for the last three years and I was their
third ever affiliate so it's like for me
I'm like I'm just so accustomed to the
brushes that are not as expensive that
worked great like I can get a brush set
like this from morphe for 150 bucks you
know rather than and you can use a
discount code on that
whereas getting this brush set for 360
I'm like what the fuck I was shook so so
many of you guys reached out to me and
asked me to do a review on this and see
if they're worth the hype if it's worth
the money or not what do I think about
the brushes themselves so today's gonna
be a full demo using the brushes I'm
into my entire face using all these
brushes I'm not gonna use any other
brushes but these and we'll see what we
actually think of the brushes whether
they're worth the 360 I am skeptical
I truly am I'm like I don't know if
anything's worth 360 PS I'm doing a
whole entire giveaway month in December
in today's video I will be doing the
giveaway the giveaway prize is this
right here I will leave it on the screen
all you need to do is subscribe to my

can get a hold of you and if you guys
want to tell me why you guys would like

want to make sure that my giveaway
prices are going to good people you know
what I mean so I'm gonna stop rambling
let's go and get started on today's
video as always if you guys do not like
this video if you guys do not like me
please don't fucking watch it you know
the drill with that but if you guys do
like this video please go ahead and
subscribe to my channel if you're not
already and if you're new what's up a
man um you a and welcome to my channel
thank you so much for being here yeah
let's get into this I apologize for
using the same background you know I'm
just like really living for the
Christmas spirit you know let me live
for the fucking Grinch like fucking tree
over here and the little howleen I don't
I don't really know any that said it is
anyway let's get into the video
so before we start on today's meal let's
go and talk a little bit about the
brushes themselves so you get 16 brushes
for the entire kit and it comes with
this silver brush holder the brush
holder itself is actually very cheap
looking like it actually is very very
cheap looking at the quality of it it's
just like any other brush case like it's
nice quality like everything is fine the
stitching is well done
all that stuff is good but look like the
way it looks everything about it just
looks very cheap to me that's just my
personal aesthetic and my style I'm like
I just looks like not expensive and it
doesn't feel luxurious doesn't feel
expensive it doesn't feel like it would
be worth three hundred sixty dollars
coming with the brushes you know you're
getting nya faced ones and I believe you
get 7i ones and on Kylie's website you
guys can actually see she lists every
single brush individually sold and how
much it's gonna cost individually and
she posted how much it's gonna be for
the bundle so for the bundle it's 360
and individually the prices range from
48 dollars to be in the most expensive
the big powder brush to 18 dollars being
the least expensive so that already I'm
like like I'm stuck like truly I'm shook
I think the thing to is like the reason
a lot of people are upset about this
situation not only is it like the price
point is ridiculous it is it totally is
I'm like what the fuck but she tweeted
saying that she was trying her hardest
to make everything as inexpensive but
high quality as possible and honestly
I'm creating a brand I know about markup
I know how much things cost to me I'm
not stupid I know about this thing I
know all about all the backend of that
stuff and I know for a fact that she
could have gone cheaper with these
brushes there's no way in hell like from
the bottom of my heart I know she could
have gone cheaper and I just it is what
it is like she wants a higher markup and
that's okay that's her brand that's fine
and she was also comparing her brand to
Mac and Kevin a Quan and it's like
people were so pissed cuz Kevin Kwan is
a legend and Mac is Ana legendary brand
and it's like you can't really compare
me don't compete at this point like
they've been in it for years and years
and years and years and Kylie has been
doing this for a couple years now and
she's of course made her mark in the
beauty industry but she is not a
high-end brand like those brands are
she's not sold in Nordstrom
she's an e-commerce brand she has like
her pop-up shops and Topshop and things
like that but like a spades of spades it
is what it is so that's why I think
people are so upset just wanting to talk
about that really back-end really
quickly so I'm gonna go ahead and do my
gnome routine I'm gonna try using these
brushes I'm very very intrigued by them
I see this little flat kabuki I mean
they feel very soft
there's no denying they they feel
fucking good nice they feel very nice
and me see okay I'm confused because she
tweets I
developed for you guys the most amazing
luxury brochures ever I am very excited
real brushes don't compare to synthetic
brushes different performance quality
everything I am 100% down to do an
entire synthetic line in the future
which will ultimately be cheaper so I'm
assuming these are real brushes or
natural hair I think that's what she's
trying to say even though I personally
think they're synthetic brushes that
have been absolutely amazing anyway
there's nothing else to say besides that
I think we're good
okay let's go ahead and we're gonna go
right in we're gonna go in with the
number six brush this is a foundation
looking brush it looks like a one of
those kabuki brushes so we're shouldn't
go in we're gonna see how it if she
perform I'm taking my Laura Mercier
flawless foundation follows fusion
foundation which actually matches me
pretty good so on the face the brushes
feel nice like it does feel good there's
no denying that it feels good let's see
how it looks up close and see like it's
even leaked see this shedding I just
found like two bristles on my face Oh
shedding which isn't like the end of the
world of course brushes shed that's like
a normal part of brushes okay so so far
everything is looking pretty good I'm
not upset I'm not mad at it though the
brush looks like it looks fucking dirty
I wish the bristles weren't that white
like I wish they weren't like this pure
white cuz it just shows how easily dirty
everything gets its leaving streaks on
my face but where do we just write that
one let's go ahead and use the number
two brush this looks like one of those
duo fiber brushes maybe this will apply
the foundation better maybe this is
supposed to be the foundation brush who
knows see for this stuff like for you
using like liquid foundation and some I
like synthetic brushes more I just feel
like real brushes they just soak up so
much liquid product whenever using a
product that's liquid I like to use
synthetic brushes I don't like natural
hair brushes for liquid real natural
hair absorbs product so much more than
something that's synthetic but hair
fibers themselves have like divots and
then they have holes and they absorb and
they take away products so whenever I'm
using a natural hair brush for
foundation I'm always like so the
foundation everything looks fine like
everything's on and it looks good it
just took me a good like five minutes to
get this to the way I wanted it to be
and that's already too long like I need
it to be quick I want to be fast so this
one I would suggest I don't like it I
didn't like this one either
more than this one not the biggest fan
of this don't even know what the fuck to
use I should for like I literally have
no idea I'm using I guess bronzer and
other things but no but do you know what
the brush itself works the foundation
ends up looking good so if you
technically bought this brush it would
work you would get the like you would
get the look that you're going for it
just took a little bit too long and I
feel like this isn't me a bitch to clean
because of how far I went in and seeped
in because it absorbs so much product
well we got the base done so now it's
some concealer time go ahead and apply
so our target tape in the shade light
let's just switch between NARS and tart
so I feel like this brush is gonna be
the concealer brush this is and this is
brush number seven it just looks like a
reminds you so much of the Mac one like
that Mac duo fiber brush let me see if
he doesn't see this alone like it has I
could do o to it right at the tip not a
duo fiber but like they are duo fiber in
a way but it's the same bristles I don't
really know it just shaped like a duo
fiber brush whatever I'm gonna go ahead
and press this underneath the eye and
blend out feels a little scratch so just
feel like this one just feels a little
bit pokey like I would never use this
for underneath my eye because it is kind
of poking meat but those are almost too
like sharp but the product looks really
nice underneath I like it definitely
made it look very pretty look the face
looks fucking beat but it did take off a
lot of product so now we're gonna take
brush number eight to go and set
underneath the eye and that one feels so
much nicer just say like it doesn't feel
hard and intense for me brushes I have
natural hair work great for powder
powder products that work really really
really nicely this one feels great at
playing with powder it feels really
really really nice actually so I'm very
happy about that
we got a good one guys you got a good
one I'm Shea number eight her brush
number eight I fuck with you Anna Maria
fuck with you you know one of the three
they fuck with one of the four actually
now I'm gonna take this Big Mama brush
this is number one we're gonna go and
put that all over and set entire thing
with my two-faced ethereal powder this
brush it feels very smooth this one
feels very very nice I definitely
definitely like this one it's so of
course a little bit like pokey and a
little bit bristly because I am like
doing this on it the thing is though
this is 48 dollars by itself 48 dollars
for just this one brush as you can see
my foundation picks up on it because to
natural hair anyway you guys I just
don't it's not worth $48 it's just not
man like the brushes fall apart easily
if you just like kind of move them to
the side they fucking fall off the
morphe e to for example the morphe e to
is fuck
incredible its synthetic and that's like
20 bucks and it looks exactly like this
and I honestly like what I want you guys
to spend money on something that I do
think that you can get at a cheaper
price I'm not over here hating coyote
cosmetics I feel like Kylie has done
such amazing things and I think that her
brand has done so well and she's done so
well for herself and she's an amazing
businesswoman but that doesn't mean that
I'm gonna say something doesn't work
because it's it's fucking it works but
it's not worth that coin now that we're
powered we're just gonna keep on
powering through anyway we're gonna go
and take the Marc Jacobs tantric now
we're gonna take a brush number four
this is like a chisel e bronzy
contouring brush see this this is where
the realm is this is where I'm gonna I
feel and enjoy the brushes more because
I like natural hair brushes for powders
I think powders are great when it comes
to these kind of bristles so we're gonna
just go ahead and go on in right here
and that picks up powder beautifully
deposits it really nicely and it feels
really great this one doesn't feel like
scratches other ones do either actually
feels so so much nicer Wow and it
blended it very very well I enjoy this
special I would definitely use this one
again okay let's see how much number
four is this guy retails for $26 again I
still feel like that's way too much
money there's plenty of morphe brushes
that are comparable to this brush like
this brush works great it definitely
does there's no denying any nice and it
deposits the powder nicely and it blends
everything really nicely so that's good
like that's great I'm very happy about
that
maybe I'm just a cheap ass and I like
since I've been using morphe for years
and years and years like I think I'm
kind of skewed when it comes to makeup
right now like I just am like I know I
am like whenever I'm buying something
like I'll be like oh I can get it
somewhere else cheaper morphine
colour-pop and brands like that that's
all things are really inexpensive
I've skewed my vision when it comes to
makeup and it's just it is what it is
friends like that have a lower price
point have skewed my buying because it
makes me want to I want to save money
and I want like a better incentive and I
want better products for a lower price I
just do this brush worked great so far
these two are good these are wins for me
the other ones I'm like okay guys so now
we're going through some blush
we're take a new brush we're gonna take
this brush number five oh and take our
little wheel of fortune here from Tarte
my favorite fucking thing of holiday
2017 we're gonna go and put that ooh
yeah I really like this for blush holy
shit when you're applying powders with a
natural hair brush it's so funny how
like you can just notice a difference
between using a synthetic brush that's
something I will definitely say
percent like this one feels really nice
it goes on very nice lens very nice so
I'm living for this brush tool this is
working don't get me wrong but it's end
of it we're gonna talk about the price
point at the end of the day is it worth
three hundred and sixty dollars yeah the
brushes are gonna work like of course
they're gonna work hope I mean I'm
hoping is she worth the money though or
not rush number nine a little
highlighting brush go ahead a highlight
with this been a bitch we're gonna take
miss old for nikkietutorials yes mama
her beautiful glow goes glow goes I've
been using this bitch forever
see that's the highlight
that's the highway it's not really
necessarily the best course the fan
brush works
it's depositing it very nicely oh my
word
I put too much hunk it his hand brushes
applying the highlight very nicely it's
just a classic fan brush Dan brush 20
absolutely not in this bitch I pay like
five bucks for pretty sure more if he
has one for five bucks I was just like
I'm sorry there's just no way there's
just not a way in hell did it work yes
totally it totally worked
what is it worth it okay it's gonna move
on to the browser which is a brows and
imma do the eyes real quick and then
we'll be done and I'm gonna talk about
the final verdict okay cool so we have
the rest of the face on the little nose
contour did my brows off the camera and
I actually use the brush number 14 to
line my brows and prime my eyes with a
paper from Mac now I have to say about
it is that I worked very nicely as you
can see like one of those just flat
detailed concealer brushes that's really
good at packing anyway brush number
fourteen really did work very nicely
just wanted to point that out there
because I didn't do on camera she lined
the brows prime the eyes is go ahead and
do the eyes and now officially and we're
gonna be taking the nice palette from
Kylie Jenner's brand because I love this
palette and that would be fitting to use
her palettes with her brushes you know
I'm saying where I hate the shade below
Laboy we're gonna be taking brush number
15 very fluffy shader brush okay putting
it into the crease everything feels
normal
it's a little bit rough not gonna lie I
mean so like synthetic brushes in the
eye - but it's blending out everything
beautifully and like I said earlier when
you're using natural hair brushes to put
down powder everything always I'm just
looking so good looks very beautiful
looks very blended it's very well done
so there's a couple of the little
bristles falling off of this brush but I
am going a little bit more like
intensely I'm not like being so soft
with this because it is an eye brush and
I tend to like be a little bit more
rough
I'm doing my amigo cuz it's just like
quicker this is we have so far
everything looks great it looks blended
everything was blended out very nicely
now we're gonna take the brush and
number 12 take a shorter version of the
Mac 217 it's like a fluffy shader brush
and we're gonna take a little bit of
Wonderland the brush is acting a little
weird you see what's happening here like
actually happening my thing the problem
with this brush is that it's so fat and
so far apart that it's really easy to
put product on here but it some part
will transfer above I don't know I'm not
really liking this brush I feel like
it's not doing it what I wanted to do
like I feel like it's not connecting
everything nicely and seamlessly and I
know it's not the palette itself because
I used as probably many times now and
it's so good so I just leads me to
believe that it could only be the brush
because that's the only part that's
changed so there's a separation between
this area right there that's I'm trying
to take away it's a little annoying to
be really honest it really is I'm gonna
do like a floating cut crease a halo cut
crease it's like that cute little pencil
brush brush number 16 we had a little
bit of hot cider which is like a D dark
chocolate cocoa brown that's gonna go in
the outer corners everything better for
us - yeah this one's way better this
brush is so much better it's actually
like not being stupid basically feels
great this one blends are really great
like this is a win okay now we're gonna
put a little bit of this gold shade slay
it's right in the center and just fuckin
fuck it up okay perfect so now we're
gonna go and finish the other high off
camera and we'll be right back and I'm
gonna play eyeliner and mascara and
lashes so we don't waste our time okay
guys so she is on she is done the face
is fully beat to the fucking ground this
is the final look this is how everything
turned out things really pretty it
wasn't like whole point of this video is
obviously not my makeup what I'm wearing
right now but if you guys are curious
I'm wearing a sepia anasazi liquid
lipstick and I'm wearing a Lily lashes
at Miami on the eyes these are like my
go-to lash right now oh yeah so we're
done with the video I use basically
every single brush other than these two
these are the two I didn't really use
this when I did a little bit just a
blender Neath my lower lash line a very
small amount it wasn't anything too
crazy I would say I didn't really use
this and I did not use this one either
this is the number three Russia
oh no I use 14 of the brushes so I think
I do have a good grasp on the brushes
and what I think of them okay guys so
final verdict what do I think of the
brush set is it worth three hundred and
sixty dollars or not my thoughts are
this brush
is not worth $360 does the brush set
work yes it totally does it's a natural
hair bristle they are very very nice
they feel nice on the face
they definitely blend make up very
nicely like I could not deny that the
products work well that is for sure that
it's going without saying but 16 brushes
for $360 less shipping and plus tax
holy shit like that comes out to like
400 bucks for a brush set could you
fucking fathom spending 400 ours on
reverse it I really cannot I cannot
imagine it and it's frustrating because
high Cosmetics like obviously Kylie
cosmetics is popular because of Kylie
Jenner and she puts her face on her name
on these products and that's why they
sell so well so it's frustrating for me
as a consumer and as someone that does
reviews and things like that online
that's like because it's her name kids
and people are gonna want to buy this
$360 brush set and I just feel like it's
not fair and I feel like it's a little
bit too expensive and right a little bit
I mean it's way too fucking expensive I
can literally go online right now we can
go to morphe brushes website right now
okay let's go and go to their one of
their brush sets like a high-end nice
one for example they have Jacqueline
Hills favorite brushes Jacqueline awe
has an entire brush collection that's
like her favorite and that's 23 brushes
for 155 plus you get to you the discount
code on it so I believe you receivable
an extra 15 20 bucks so that's already
nuts the entire morphia gilded
collection the gilded set 159 bucks all
of these brushes and they're so
high-quality they're also they're
synthetic but they're very very very
high quality brushes I feel like because
I'm a beauty influencer I do know a lot
about some products and I feel like I do
have a good head on my shoulders and I
feel like I have to have good opinions
on certain things and do these products
work yes they do but is it worth the
range of 60 dollars no it's not I would
suggest going if you guys really wanted
a good brush set if the Jacqueline Hill
favorites for more if we get the gilded
collection from morphe I just think it's
too much money 360 dollars the brushes
should fucking sing to me and feed me
grapes yeah guys I love you so much
