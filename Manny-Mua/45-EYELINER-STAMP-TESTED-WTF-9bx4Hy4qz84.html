so today's video is going to be a fun
testing of a product video this is going
to be a review and the product we are
going to be reviewing is the vamp stamp
vamp stamp basically what it is it's a
tool to help you do perfect winged liner
I say I do the air quotes because you
never know what these kind of shits
it could be Chandi and come being good
so this guy went viral on Twitter I got
so many requests from you guys to test
it out see what I think about the vamp
stamp it is $25 retail and you can get
at the vamp stamp website so it's not a
cheap item by any means you can buy a
eyeliner brush for like five dollars so
this is definitely not a cheap item but
it's supposed to make applying eyeliner
so much easier than the traditional way
of actually applying liner so let's go
ahead and see how this bad bitch turns
out for us as always if you guys don't
like this video if you guys do not like
me please don't fucking watch you know
Joe with that what if you guys do like
this video please subscribe to my
channel if you're not already any free
new what's up at Manny anyway and
welcome to my channel thank you so much
for being here I really appreciate it so
yeah that's gonna get into this review
of this vamp stamp eyeliner stamp
fucking so we have the vamp stamp create
magic makeup for immediate release what
the vamp stamp create magic makeup for
immediate release vamp stamp create
magic make up for immediate release that
sounds fucking dirty for a mere release
oh so they have three different types of
wings they have a kitten wing the medium
wing and they have the large wing I have
the large wing pack with me and it also
comes with a little one
no doesn't come with this what so we
have the pink in vortex which is a long
wear cushion ink pad for the wing part
and then we have the Vava voom which is
the actual applicator so I think that
this comes separately I did not know
that you get the bottom stamp which is
25 bucks and then you get the ink
eyeliner and angle brush for 20 so I
think total this whole product scheme is
45 bucks which is definitely
a high price point it's not cheap by any
fucking means so I'm really hoping this
is gonna work because you are paying a
pretty penny for this product
ignore my makeup I'm on right now I did
a review on to be honest I see a
subculture palette I'm not sure if this
is going up before that but that's why
my makeup is looking like this and I
wanted to double purpose and film
another video after because I'm not
driving another one tomorrow so I'm
gonna take the above of them large
because you guys know I'm a bitch when
it comes to wings a good wing so we're
gonna take the this is for the right ah
oh my god it's like a little star mm-hmm
okay okay
so we're gonna take this there's a
little seal over it which is cool things
that can preserve the product it looks
like a little ink pad it's literally as
if you were to get a stamp so I'm gonna
take be right goes out like this okay
wanna take the right right now we're
gonna dunk it in wait it's not saturated
for you okay I would definitely suggest
instead of doing this going side to side
cuz that fully saturates the actual um
thing it's going oh my god my fucking
nervous guys should go right here
where's there
okay oh my god it's really annoying it's
not as pretty sick I was gonna be okay
let me just finish off this eyeliner
really quick look how far this wing goes
out I've never had a wing like this okay
we're gonna try the smaller medium one
because that was not cute I'm sorry it
wasn't good at all oh my god and I live
for a fucking bald wing with that's too
much oh my god I just ruined my makeup
Manny Winehouse is in the building so
guys final verdict what do we think
about this we think we hey I'm not the
biggest fan I think that this looks so
fucked like truly like from the bottom
of my heart fucked ah just like a casual
like a Hilux fuck it's like a true
bottom of my heart
fucking gust oh fuck you know what I'm
saying like this is a real fucked
situation all-in-all guys I do not think
this is worth the money I think that you
guys should definitely save your coin by
a five-dollar brush by Maybelline
eyeliner that's like ten dollars and yes
it's a little bit harder to use and yes
it's a little bit more of a work
challenge but this trying to fix this is
gonna be a lot harder it's gonna be a
lot harder than going in with your
original liner so um I definitely say
this is a complete miss for me complete
flop No thank you no gracias
and God yeah you guys thank you guys so
much for watching I will leave this a
link down below if you guys do want to
check it out just in case as always our
use of the night or day wherever you
guys are and I'll catch you guys in my
next video
bye you guys they uh stop tickling my
toes but yeah telling each other you
know y'all there's one good to this
review of guys on exploited okay what
