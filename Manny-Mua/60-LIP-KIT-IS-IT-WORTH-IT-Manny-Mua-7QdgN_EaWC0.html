today's video I'm really really really
excited to be filming because it's all
about the new Pat McGrath lip kit look
at this bad bitch usually it's like
filled up with sequin like all the way
to the top like you couldn't see these
products in it but I was too excited and
I opened it and I like poured out all
the sequins I don't want to make a mess
in my room but you can see a couple of
pink ones right there and then the
bottom it's really cute
so basically Pat McGrath first product
she came out with were highlighters
which were absolutely amazing I really
wanted them but they were sold out and I
just I don't have any of them sadly huh
but I really like a bucket I need some
of Jeffrey's and they're absolutely
amazing intensely pigmented highlighters
which I love and recently she just came
out with these new lip kits like the lip
lust
0:04 and for the club I had the shape
flesh and I personally was sent this
product Holly was sent the one so I
don't have like the darker shade and I
have like the redder shades or anything
at that but I do have the nude ones so
hey let's go and try them out I really
wanted to try them out on camera I
haven't actually put them on my lips
cheater and hand out in your first
impressions and I really wanna try this
out because this is sixty bucks man this
kit mind you it has five products in it
which i think is a lot for sixty bucks
five products and that's actually pretty
bomb not gonna lie I know that there's
like ultimate kit of 250 bucks and
that's literally all three of the color
of the kids combined and then there's
one where it's just a lipstick solo for
like 25 bucks I think so I mean it's
cool that you can mix and match and pick
and choose whatever you want with the
thing this is the first edition limited
release flesh kit where was this bad
bitch mate let's let's talk about this
so comes with a flash lipstick one flush
subject to a clear vinyl gloss the
metallic gold pigment and the flesh
micro fine glitter straight from the
lamp
very very very cool he lipsticks
themselves were made in Italy and the
pigment glosses made in Canada and the
flesh glitter is made in Canada and the
gold pigment is in the US how funny that
this is all like all over the place now
buy one lap which is really cool I mean
hey mix a match man if you can if you
find a good in other labs use that
 honestly there's a jump right in
why am i beating around them from the
real bush I don't know
okay let's take these bad bitches out so
we get the go ping and then BOOM I'm
actually excited try that honestly I'm
so stoked
mm-hmm okay flash number one right here
let's watch it
ooh that's nicely pigmented guys feels
good it looks really beautiful obviously
this is a news of my alley
and so let's go and swatch number two
this guy right here also extremely
pigmented stunning it's like a dusty
mauve
purple Shane gorgeous gorgeous
pigmentation gorgeous color we have the
gold pigment which looks like this it's
a little swatch it on the back of my
hand just to say be swatched it right
here it's right there right next to the
Mavi color the flesh number two lipstick
I'm honestly late the payment is not
that greatly I was expecting more I've
seen on Instagram people mix it with the
gloss so that's kind of how you're
supposed to use it I suppose so I'm
hoping that that will look a lot better
a brand I am Korean make some of the
gloss this is something else right there
mix it why not let's just see how it
looks
hey I would say it's definitely becoming
more and more metallic and intense with
the gloss for sure at first I was like
oh I'm not that impressed and we
also have the nude micro fine glitter
which is a really really really pretty
basically it's like a rose gold glitter
rose gold there cool cool so let's go
ahead and put these bitches on the lips
I haven't tried anything yet okay so
let's try flesh number one and let's see
how it applies only lips in the mirror
applies it very smooth very creamy so
much there's basically like an orange e
nude I'm not even the plan this is crazy
for me what are we doing I like it so
far for sure so this is the color of
flesh number one very peachy yellowy
nude it's not a nude um used to at all
just not the kind of nude family that I
go for my any mean but the lipstick
itself is extremely comfortable and very
pretty it's obviously very pigmented as
you can see outside is nothing more of a
satin finish it's not matte but it's not
shiny either so it's not like a cream
but it's definitely very very very
pretty this kind of color though on me
for some reason makes me look a little
bit like ill so not the biggest fan of
this color specifically but and you guys
are into the like yellowy nudes like the
yellowy orange nudes you're gonna be
upset what if we Pat a little bit of the
gold with the gloss on top of this why
don't we do thinking am I being cray be
honest so we're gonna add a little bit
of the gold pigment I'm just gonna mix
this bad bitch in oh whoa whoa whoa are
you guys seeing this this is
becoming like liquid gold liquid metal
much more intense than it was by itself
with the gloss it's like regressing
put on other lips because mommy is a
painting okay
ah that's right Wow
okay so this is what it looks like mixed
with the lipstick so I feel like it
looks a little bit kind of green tone
what are you saying you guys think it
looks golden egressing looks a little
green I think looks a little bit of
green has a little bit of a green tint
to it it's writing so much like Mac's
old gold kind of thing but again it's
super cool that effect is so sick you
guys see how mirrored my lips are
they're intense I don't think I would
mix this color with the gold pigment
because I don't like really the green
effect but what I'm thinking of doing is
after I do the other color I'll do just
the gold with the gloss and see how that
looks by itself and I think it'll give
more of a golden look rather than more
of a greenish hue but it's sick dude
it's different it's different
okay so on to the next color
am I going on with these shade flesh
number two this is more of a dusty mauve
a show you let's see how this looks one
swipe wholly pigment okay I like that
this even feels better than the
last one I don't like ace Wow extremely
pigmented extremely smooth slow hard
over draw when the edges little blood
but not everyone over draws that's more
of a me problem this color this
pigmentation is actually everything and
I'm kind of obsessed like for this
formula in this color I would pay 25
bucks because individually 225 the other
one I feel like the formula is a little
bit different I feel like it wasn't as
pigmented it's pigmented but it's not a
straight into this this one it's so this
one's like full coverage intense right
away very smooth very creamy very
lightweight on the lips too which I
really appreciate tell me this is not
stunning you can't get the date so for
this one let's just do a little bit of
gloss on it to see what the gloss will
look like on top to see how intensely
shiny the gloss is and then what had the
glitter on top of that oh wow look how
wet my lips look guys looks so pouty oh
I like it I like it that gloss really
gives you an intense ass reflect hope it
was shook okay let's go add the glitter
on top of this Oh
leather is a little hard to take out huh
what I ended up having to do was stick a
little pin inside the glitter hole
to make it kind of loosened up and I
finally got some out on the cap can you
see but it was a struggle you can't
really just do right away cuz it's so
filled up with glitter which is great so
it's going to put this on oh oh oh my
god
this is gorgeous what do you guys think
I think it looks sick honestly
because the soil looks like with flesh
number two with the glitter on top I
don't have you guys can see but honestly
it looks so stunning I don't know kind
of talking funny because I don't want to
eat all the glitter what you want to do
is use like glitter glue to secure glass
like the lit cosmetics glitter glue or
the two-faced glitter glue that will
work really really well with this type
of look but honestly it looks so pretty
can you guys tell I can like hear myself
eating all the glitter crunching hmm
it's gorgeous
okay cool so let's go ahead and take off
this one and just do the gold by itself
and see how it looks
that's us trying every single
combination and we'll see what we get
okay last but not least let's go ahead
and try just the glass with the pigment
by itself let's see how it looks
together we're gonna do just blouse and
a big little circle looks like that okay
so we're gonna mix in the gold pigment a
good ol amount in the air
and let's mix it all together with our
fingers it just looks so cool honestly
you just such like a little potion ahh
some a bitch it looks crazy I'm living
ok put on with our fingers for now and
then we'll use a brush later ooh whoa
whoa
and this would look like by itself again
I feel like I'm talking a little funny
you can see that oh that is a sticky
gloss ah okay so I don't really know how
I feel about the gloss by itself with
the with the gold pigment I also you
just feel like it's really really sticky
but I don't think I put on a lot which
is my mistake I don't think you need
this much to get the color payoff but I
really did want to just kind of really
make sure that everything was there and
intense and really doing intoning crazy
right away so this is what it looks like
by itself with just the gloss and the
pigment I think it's so sick I think
it's a little bit less green than it was
but still definitely more of a greenish
tone to it
what do you guys think what do you guys
wear this out like casually would you
guys wear a gold ass mirrored lip
casually I think this effect is really
really cool it's very different very
unique I definitely think it's more on
the editorial side are a lot people
going to be taking this and wearing this
out sugar grocery shopping maybe maybe
but as everyone definitely not I think
the effect is super badass it does get
over all over my teeth but it's one of
those things man you got to forfeit it
for that cool fit now I'm gonna go and
give you is it worth it or not is it
worth the price or not so drum roll PS I
really want to come up with a better
name for it this like series of me
reviewing products and saying if it's
worth it or not like if it's worth the
price or not maybe you actually help me
with that you guys can get an idea what
to call this like is it worth it or not
kind of like a title like yeah you're
naked of thing let me know in the
comments bar below cuz I really
appreciate your guys input because I'm
just not gonna coming up with that kind
of
you know I just try to make the videos
here I would love you guys his opinions
on it in the comments bar below please
leave me something please leave me
something if you guys can come up with
something it would be great so back to
the video is the entire kit worth $60
honestly and my real true opinion I
don't think it's worth $60 the lipsticks
themselves these guys are they worth 25
bucks yes I think the lipstick itself is
absolutely beautiful I think they're
stunning I think they're beautiful
and if you're gonna buy both of them I
would definitely just get the kit
instead but for me the first color has
like more of a yellowy orange tint to it
I don't like that kind of color this
color I'm obsessed with I would buy this
100% I would spend 25 bucks and a harpy
for this but for this kit the flesh kit
hmm I would not spend 60 bucks for
because honestly it's not doing
for me gold color for me it has a green
tint to it that I don't like I don't
like a greenish tint to the gold I want
it to be a pure intense solid gold the
clear glass I can get clear gloss
anywhere and the glitter I have tons and
tons and tons of glitters from different
brands that are cosmetic great glitter
that can work just as well so do I think
total is it worth 60 bucks
I don't I think the concept is fantastic
and sure the other shades are fantastic
I only have the flesh one so I can only
go off of this one maybe one of the
other kids is absolutely amazing and
worth the 60 but for me in my opinion on
this flesh kit is worth 16 no is flesh
number 2 lipstick worth 25 yeah
it's absolutely amazing but yeah that's
my honest opinion on the matter I hope
you guys enjoy this video I'm in no way
shape or form trying to bash the brand
at all
I think the products are still beautiful
I just don't think it's worth $60 you
know I'm saying so I'm just trying to
save you guys some coin so if you guys
think it's worth the money ya go
out and buy it awesome but unless you're
going to be doing glitter lips and
golden chrome like cyborg lips it's not
gonna really be worth it for you hope
you guys enjoyed this video let me know
what you guys I should call this series
this reviewing series of products to
review I would love another name and I
would love an opinion on it but yeah
other than that here's the night or day
where you guys are and I will catch you
guys in my next video bye you guys I
love you so much
look because it is a WoW our phone
texting guys Mir dang it there's gonna
get everywhere huh oh okay
