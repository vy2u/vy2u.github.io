what is up you guys how have you guys
been it's been a minute since I have
filmed I know I always say this nursing
video like goddamn we get it what what
is up you guys today's video I'm really
really excited to be filming because I
got these new colour-pop supernova
shadows in the mail and my first ice
washed them and I'm like oh my word my
first thought was that these are so much
like the Stila glitters like the ones
that are in like this shape or this
shape - oh wait hold on before
everything starts boom you guys I got a
tattoo ah oh my god my mom is gonna be
Shooks I got it today I got a little
crescent moon tattoo on my finger so
when I'm doing poses and doing things
like this a little thank you so much -
Evan tattoo for tattooing me he's a
wonderful tattoo artist based in New
York and he's absolutely amazing I love
him Thank You Evan for the tattoo Nikita
thank you for helping me connect with
Evan anyway so all I'm saying is that
these supernova shadows remind me so
much of the Stila magnificent metals and
glitter and glow shadows and the swatch
I was like wait that's - it was weird so
I was like you know what these are $7
and these are 24 so I thought why don't
we go ahead and try them both out see
what we think you guys already know I
love the Stila glitters
I think they're absolutely amazing I
wear them all the time I've never tried
the supernova shadows so I'm very very
very intrigued to try these out and see
if they are a nice dupe for the Stila
ones this is kind of like a this video
is like a battle like 25% of the cost of
this one is this one so if they work
just as good that'd be really really
cool to really be able to invest in a
multiple colors in the color pop one
yeah guys anyway that's what today's
video is going to be that's why I have
it both of my lids a blank on each eye
to put on one on the other they're
obviously not the same exact color but
it's close enough it's close enough as
always if you guys do not like this
video if you guys do not like me please
don't watch it you know the drill with
that but if you guys that do like this
video please subscribe to my channel if
you're not already and if you're new
what's up a man um you a welcome to my
channel thank you for being here
I very much appreciate it yeah guys it's
going to get into this comparison video
of its Stila versus the color poop no
color pop the color pop versus Stila
ok so I'm gonna go ahead and look up on
the Sephora app what are these products
Stila we have this Stila brilliant
long-wearing liquid glitter eyeshadow
these are $24 and they're sold at
Sephora or
Sheila's website of course these are
long wearing Sparkle shadow with perfect
blend of pearls and glitter to have your
eyes with incredible uniquely
lightweight water infused texture glides
effortlessly then dries down smoothly
locking it in maximal Sparkle and
minimum fallout which is true I've worn
these for like 10 hours on end minimal
fallout not a lot on my lash line or
anything like that I really really do
enjoy these a lot this has 4.5
milliliters of product which is point 15
ounces for 24 bucks so it's going to
look up the colour-pop ones here we have
walk of fame which is a $7 supernova
shadow high-impact ultra glittery
shadows have a metallic base an
extremely long wearing can be used as a
base alone or as a topper this one has
two point seventeen ounces four point
seven grams so it has a little bit more
than the Stila one and it is a much less
and much more affordable so it's time to
see what we think you guys are this is
amazing I'm gonna be chuck for real so
I'm gonna go ahead and zoom in so we can
see exactly how they apply it on the I
already know exactly how these steel
ones apply they have pi very nicely so
we're gonna go ahead and play the Stila
shade in the shade rose gold recho i
wanted to apply kitten karma that's my
favorite one but I can't find it
anywhere don't know where it is at all
have to go out and buy a new one there
it applies very wet and glittery these
two will not be the same shade just
ignore that we're just gonna ignore that
it is of course a thicker consistency
because it does have glitter shimmer
particles in it so you cannot expect it
to feel like water you know it is
definitely a thicker consistency so
don't blend the edges a little bit I
always do this I'm wearing the Stila
ones so go ahead and blend out a little
bit on the edges so it's an effortless
smooth transition love love love and
boom stunning now guys we're gonna go in
with the colour-pop supernova shadow so
as I'm pulling it out right now of the
tube I know that it's a little bit more
dry not as much comes off on the paddle
as
the Stila one does so that's kind of
annoying I'm actually gonna pump back
and forth which usually isn't really
good but I'm trying to get enough
product on the brush okay let's try that
out
also same exact applicator it son same
paddle applicator so now it's going to
apply this one oh my gosh I'm using it
okay we're playing around playing it you
guys is it playing literally identical
as the other one I'm not kidding you
what I say it feels exactly the same it
really really does actually feels a
little bit thinner so I stick as a
formula as the steel one is actually
it's a little bit thinner and there's
less product that gets picked up using
the colour-pop buttons there's not as
much product which is kind of odd okay
let's go ahead and blend out that shade
as well with the brush just how we did a
little Steel aside same exact thing how
is it gonna blend you guys it's
literally acting the exact same as the
Stila one and I feel like it looks like
identical do we just find a dupe guys I
think we just found a dupe and it's
literally 75% cheaper damn flip-up
really coming for steelo huh okay guys
so let's go ahead and look at the shape
so we can see them right now of course
the shades and themselves are different
this one is a little bit more rose gold
and this was a little bit more gold but
the effect that it has on the lid the
glitter flakes everything about it
really is so similar that I could
honestly if I was wearing it inside my
side and had someone be like okay which
one do you think is the cheap one or the
one that's seven bucks I don't think you
could tell like I really do not think
you could tell so I'm gonna go ahead and
do some eyeliner and put some lashes on
and I'm actually gonna wear these for a
couple hours and see how they react on
the high how much fallout it is and
things like that and then I will be back
to let you guys know after a couple of
hours how they wore but so far so good
they're both drying down identically the
same so I'm actually hoping they're
gonna wear exactly the same as well
because if they do holy I've got a
great deal okay guys I will see you in a
couple hours
okay guys what is up I am back it's been
about three to four hours since I
started filming the first section it's
pretty late now into the night I was
just kind of chilling with my brother
playing with zaiah
eating watching American Horror Story so
we're just kind of chillin in the
household and I wanted to come into a
check-in because I'm kind of tired I
want to go to bed I can't until I'm done
checking in with y'all let's talk about
really quickly let's see how it wore
throughout the couple hours I was
wearing it so okay so as you remember
right side is a Stila looking at the
lashes there's not a single little piece
of a fallout the Stila ones stay so
intensely this I already knew I
absolutely love the Stila magnificent
metals glitter this was a complete win
for me of course he looked absolutely
amazing one of you guys can see on
camera but there are little glitter
specks down here on the lashes there are
glitter flakes actually a spot right
there missing from the pigment
completely which is kind of odd little
bit more chunky by the lash line on this
eye
oh there's also fallout on my face on
this side as well there's about I can
see there's about eight glitter glitter
flakes right there ooh and there too you
guys so what do we think what do we
think about the shades are the color pop
supernova shadows a dupe for these Stila
magnificent metals glitter shadows
honestly they are due for it they are a
really really really close
good dupe for the Stila ones however I
definitely do like the Stila ones more
if they are of course a bit more
expensive but you actually see and tell
in the formula that they are more
expensive but they wear better they dry
better and they have more glitter
reflect in it then this side does I know
when I was going on originally this side
looked like it was like really intense
and glittery but it was actually this
side add more glitter particles in it
and they looked a lot more seamless and
beautiful than it did on this side
besides just a little more chunky and
flaky then this side is this one has no
flakes on it whatsoever
all in all Stila for me is a win Stila
is the one that won but you guys the
colour-pop supernova shadows are an
amazing amazing comparable dupe to the
stealing ones if you guys could not
afford the $24 Stila ones I understand I
totally totally totally get it I would
definitely definitely check out the
color pop super number ones do I like
the Stila ones more yes bar these an
amazing do for it absolutely for $7 was
such a great wear time with a great
effect but how beautiful it does look on
the high there's no denying that it is
an amazing amazing do for it yeah guys
that's ever taste video because I find
it watching I had a lot of fun all in
all both of them were a complete win for
me let me know if you guys want to see
me do more videos like this I can make
this a series where it's like I'm
testing out a product that came out and
if there's a product that's similar to
it or do for it I can try it out and see
if it's actually worth the duping or
just get the original product itself you
know for me with this one I personally
love the original product so I would
continue to buy the original product but
is a dupe worth it yes as always you
guys I'll leave everything linked down
below as they always do in every single
video but I'm starting a little tire now
I'm getting like sleepy eyes because
it's
like one in the market and I'm a little
tired I love you guys so much and I will
