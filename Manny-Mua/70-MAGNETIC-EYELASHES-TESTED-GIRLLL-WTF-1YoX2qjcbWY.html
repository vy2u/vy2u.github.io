today's video is going to be a weird and
fun one I just recently purchased this
product this is from the brand 1/2 lash
and they are magnetic lashes like
literally they have a little magnet on
it and you press it together and it
becomes a full lash that's why I'm not
wearing lashes right now I had done this
makeup earlier and I had lashes on
earlier but now they're off and that's
why my lashes look a little right
now because it's a because they're low
fun so I forgot the lashes and I really
wanted to reviews because I've had this
for a while and I completely forgot I
had it and I'm like dude because it just
looks so funny so different and so
unique and honestly it was 70
dollars for this private lashes and I
was like you're kidding you're kidding
go get into that more a little bit later
on what I'm talking about the product a
little bit more so yeah you guys that's
what today's video is going to be it's
going to be a review and demo using
these little magnetic lashes and are
they going to be worth it or not are
they worth the price or not is it a hit
or miss we will see in today's video but
as always if you guys don't like this
video if you guys do not like me please
don't watch it you know the
drill with uh if you guys do like this
video please subscribe to my channel if
you're not already and if you're new
what's up and ran emulate and welcome to
my channel thank you so much for being
here
I seriously really really appreciate it
from the bottom my heart I really do
thank you for watching my videos
yeah you guys let's go and get into this
review on these little magnetic lash
this is what the box looks buying it's a
little powdery okay guys so let's
quickly just read up on exactly what it
is it's from the brand one two Cosmetics
one to last sandwiches at your natural
lashes between two ultra lightweight
fiber strips to create a bold dramatic
lash line in seconds and our unique
patent-pending design makes lashes look
long thick and luxurious while looking
unbelievably natural this breakthrough
solution works for people of all ages
ethnicities and fits any eye shape
experience the one to last revolution
today so we'll see if it really works so
this is the original lash and it is $69
as a five star review and 145 reviews my
new it's on their website so you never
really know how truthful that really is
no messy glue ultra lightweight budge
proof safe for everyday use comes in a
case like this it's a really big like
hefty a squeeze so this is what the
lashes look like in the case where you
guys literally just little lashes with a
little magnet on it and it comes with
two pairs of lashes per little bundle
came with a little instruction booklet
one whole top one to lash the one
without the red dot oh my god sue me you
guys in we're gonna try a position lash
on top of your natural lash so the
outside edges line up gray leave the top
lash where it is and pick up the bottom
lash without blinking place the bottom
lash under your natural lashes so it
meets and connects with the top lash
magnet sounds honestly really simple so
let's see if it's going to be as simple
as it sounds
you see that says without blinking it's
kind of hard to do it I'm thinking uh
grab the bottom and magnet them ah oh my
god it totally just did it so quickly it
freaked me out oh my god oh my god
uh okay they're on my eye you guys even
see them can I see that hmm but
that's not on another pair cuz I feel
like that is so little like you're
kidding on the realest realest level I
thought this was a straight-up joke like
truly I thought of the joke because it
seems so foolish I have two pairs of
lashes on right here yes see okay why
Libby was trying to move it and he
literally came off so I'm still
magnetised came off like it was nothing
huh I will ask him off page Oh bitch I
was gonna put on both pairs for both
eyes but honestly after just doing one I
know quite well how I feel about the
lashes and so um yeah so on all my
verdict guys I do not think that these
lashes are worth that I think that
they're way overpriced for the effect
that you get the effect is definitely
not anything special or anything crazy I
still think that the lashes look very
plasticky the you can feel the magnetic
little band on your lash and it feels so
weird it feels heavy it feels like a
little magnetic lash it's super super
weird and uncomfortable I think that the
price is so ridiculous for the fact that
you get one pair of lashes or two pair
lashes it's honestly a highway robbery
what they're what they're trying to ask
for people to pay for these I think it's
ridiculous and I think that you guys
should definitely not fall for the
 trick of magnetic lashes who
knows maybe I was using it wrong but
honestly I don't think you can it's
literally just a little eyelash the
reason I wanted to try them out it's cuz
I honestly thought the idea was kind of
cool and I was like dude maybe it'll
give a girly cool fluffy effect maybe
it'll stand straight up maybe it'll be
something cool but it totally wasn't it
was I was so let down because I actually
had high hopes for it even though a
skeptical I had high hopes for it but
I'm like okay then I guess uh we're just
kind of I guess we're just not gonna
work great so um sadly just did not work
for me at the end of the day it was a
Miss for me completely and I would
definitely not suggest purchasing these
at all but of course it's your money you
guys do what you want to do I just
wanted to review them for you guys to
see if you guys would be interested or
not um behind guys I think that this is
a flop and I say no-go not approved nod
for battle but yeah you guys I hope you
guys had fun watching a text video as
always have a good night or day wherever
you guys are and I will catch you guys
in my next video bye you guys
mwah pull powder pull out work oh they
look hello genetic Omo on this love
video God and out of the shitty lash
goddamn lash that was a shitty
ass lash yeah
and I definitely would not suggest
perching these and I definitely would
not suggest purchasing me I can't say
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
