anyway guys what is up how are you guys
at doing the two day it has been a
wonderful day for me so far I have
chilled
I'm not chilled I went to get laser hair
removal on my ass cheek so it's been
rough and now I'm feeling so uh getting
some done today you know I'm going
to movie a little bit later on so so
recently I uploaded a video and it was a
Sephora gift guide kind of like showing
you guys what were the best deals at
Sephora like holiday wise holiday gift
sets and give sense I thought that were
actually really really cool for Sephora
things that were actually worth the
money things that you actually like save
a good amount of money on and a lot of
you guys really really like that and I
don't know what it was but the idea just
kind of hit me to make a video that was
kind of like opposite of that so
basically you guys this video is going
to be the antithesis of that video I
think I use that word correctly I could
be wrong basically this is going to be
an aunt a holiday gift sets haul I don't
know if that even makes sense this is
like I know I've seen anti hauls going
around everywhere all over YouTube it's
basically the products that people are
not going to buy because I feel like
it's they're not worth a hype that's
surrounding the products or anything
like that I really thought I was never
really gonna film one of those videos so
I'm like no it's kind of mean and I'm
gonna do it I always just felt like kind
of guilty for the brand but I did tweet
about it and you guys really requested
me to do an anti haul for the holiday
gift sets and I feel less bad because
it's not like a core item of the brand
it's like a holiday items so it's like
you just don't buy the holiday item and
it's all good it's not like it's part of
their permanent collection
so exercise video is going to you guys
it's going to be an anti holiday gift
haul and screech are the things I would
personally not by EPSA for are things
I'm not gonna buy for holiday and things
like that cuz I just don't think that
it's worth it and the same with it's not
just the holiday stuff it's like other
products as well bad just them like this
is so not worth the money and yeah
absolutely let's go to you guys I hope
you guys enjoy it as always if you guys
do not this video guys do not like me
please you watch it you know legit with
that hey hey what if you guys that do
like to feel go ahead and give it a
thumbs up and like it also let me know
in the comments bar below if you guys do
like this kind of video if you guys want
me to continue to do like anti hauls or
things that are a little bit more on the
hypercritical side because this video is
very much me being more hyper critical
it's not me being like oh and then yeh
gung ho for these holiday things this is
like me being a lot more like critical
of the product and the price point and
the brand so you guys like that let me
know and I can tell you create more
videos like this yeah that's gonna get
into this
anteye holiday whole video okay so
before I started this video I 22
disclaim really quickly I've seen a call
before and the person that was doing it
did disclaim to their followers that yo
even if you do like this product it does
not mean that it's a better product if
you guys like it and I don't that's all
good that's a cool thing about having
different opinions about makeup you know
if a product works for me great and it
doesn't work for you then that's kind of
how the cookie crumbles you know and
vice versa so if you guys do like a
product that I don't like it's all good
do not take offense to it it's really
not that big of a deal it's just
literally different opinions like
different things different people into
playing so don't even worry about it
please don't get offended by it also so
I did I decided to do because I do have
like this and gilts and me doing these
kind of videos what I decided to do was
yeah I'm gonna talk about one product
from that brand I don't like for the
holiday sets so I'm going to suggest
another product from that brand as well
that I would think that is worth the
money and is worth the bundle price and
things like that okay so the first item
I want to talk about is from the brand
Becca and this is the appraise ski glow
face pellets and this guy comes with six
shades and it retails for $54 this is
the first item that I'm not going to be
purchasing for holiday because I like
all the PALS are starting to look the
same like Becca's coming out with
pallets I'm just like girl I literally I
saw the palette like last season like
the exact the exact same thing and
honestly if like $54 it is a higher
price point and yeah of course you are
getting six minis but I do feel like 54
bucks is a lot of money the packaging
itself is beautiful I think they did a
beautiful job at the packaging but I
think the color selection is up I'm like
I don't know it's like boring like I
feel like they come out with the same
exact palettes over and over and over
again I want to see something else I
want see something new something more
fun so that is why I'm not gonna be
purchasing the app Rees or I pray I
don't really notice either a praise ski
glow face palette and so the product I
do suggest buying from Becca
during holiday seasons because I have to
do this I feel better this is the glow
on the go highlighter set and this is 20
dollars and this guy comes in two
different shades that comes with a
champagne pop or you get opal so those
both are shades fab so you love of
course Jaclyn didn't champagne pop opal
is such an amazing she's like my
ultimate number one shade from Becca for
literally ever so basically the reason I
really really like this set is because
it's $20 it comes with two different
little highlighters of course it's the
same type of highlighter so you get the
liquid glow of that color
you get the powder glow of that color
and for only 20 bucks of course they are
mini travel sizes but I do think that
that's a really really great value
because Beca highlighters are usually
about $38 if you want to try out some of
the backup products I think that that
would be a really really really good
deal okay next product I want to talk
about in my anti not gonna buy for
Holiday Hall is the Effendi Beauty a
galaxy eyeshadow palette it looks like
this this guy retails for $60 comes with
14 shades I just think that $60 14
shades is a lot of money and they're all
like glittering moon dusty type shades I
was actually in Sephora and I swatch the
shadows on my hand and they were pretty
like don't get me wrong they were pretty
but they weren't anything to like gasp
over like I wasn't like screaming for it
and I know I'm talking about Fenton
beauty this is Rihanna's line of course
I'm sure a lot of people can be like you
know she i love Rihanna so pretty much
but it doesn't mean I'm gonna talk
highly about Auto Oliver products
because she's a badass queen of another
dimension in different lands because she
is she's not it does not mean I'm not
gonna criticize her products so I
personally don't think that that is
worth it I don't think that the cars in
it are very very wearable honestly and I
actually really don't like the hexagon
e-type shape of it it's like - all over
the place I'm like now now so what I
would recommend from Fenty beauty is
their invisi matte blotting powder which
is $32 and that of course is not a
holiday item this invisible adding
powder is literally one of the best
blotting powders I've ever used ever so
I touched up my face because I was
getting oily so I like blotted my face
the first time I used it and literally
hours later I looked in the mirror and
she was still mad as and I was like I
would like some of my coils to seep
through so I look pretty and it
literally was that letting him see
through so I think it's such an amazing
amazing amazing a blotting powder if you
guys need one if you guys are more oily
I wouldn't suggest trying the Rihanna
and miss Abbott blotting powder because
it's so the next item is from hourglass
and hourglass is a brand that absolutely
love they have such beautiful products
there's such a luxurious feeling
nice-ass brand but for me this like just
doesn't it just doesn't fly like it just
does not work for me this is the
confession
refillable lipstick set this is what it
looks like right here it is $54 and as a
retail value of $78 and the reason why
I'm talking about this is because I
already do not like the lipstick price
point of the lipstick that they have the
confession lipsticks the lipsticks
themselves are so nice they're very
luxurious feeling they
beautifully on the lips they feel so
good they're creamy and they are
beautiful but honestly they are too
expensive I think that they're way too
expensive for what they are
okay guys so the confession ultra slim
high-intensity refillable lipsticks are
$34 for dollars and it comes with point
zero three ounces point nine grams it
literally has no product in it it
literally is such a small amount of
product and the refillables of them are
22 I already feel like that's too high
it's like honestly too much I think that
the price point is ridiculous even
though the lipsticks are beautiful with
that Mountain that you're getting it's
just like it's I have no words like I
cannot speak it's too small of a mouth
like if it was like a big normal sized
lipstick like it had a normal amount
like a normal lipstick does I would
totally be maybe more into it and I'd be
like you don't it's a high-end brand it
makes sense that's a no-go for me so
what you can buy instead is the vanish
seamless foundation stick by our gusset
is 46 dollars and has 7 grams of product
I'm wearing it today I'm wearing today I
absolutely love you don't understand I
love the hourglass foundation I think
it's one of the prettiest foundations
I've ever tried it's so full coverage it
looks so beautiful on the skin it just I
cannot say enough good things about it I
wear it all the time I've gone through
two of them already it is annoying that
there is not that much product and then
there's only seven grams of product in
there but for the foundation I will
accept it because that's where art that
goes on your face it covers a big wide
variety of you can eat that so I'm fine
with that I'm like you know what if is
expensive it's fine it's fine because it
looks so good and I understand it's just
such a beautiful foundation so the next
anti holiday haul item that I'm going to
talking about is from Bobby Brown this
is the nude drama eyeshadow palette and
it retails for $59 and it comes with
twelve shadows personally I think the
palette looks boring I literally have so
many thoughts like it give them morphine
35f you're fine you're good you don't
need this palette it's just so basic to
me it's so boring and for 60 bucks for
12 shades I'm like you know I mean like
it just it literally makes no sense to
me so I will not be purchasing the new
drama eyeshadow palette I just will not
but from Bobby Brown what you could
purchase that's absolutely an amazing
amazing amazing deal is their BB u
palette so it's actually really really
weird so it looks like this actually has
all the foundations all the concealers
from Bobbi Brown packed into one palette
it is
pensive it's 250 bucks it's actually so
worth if you are a working makeup artist
if you are someone that wants to do
makeup on other people if you have
clients and things like that
honestly the Bobbi Brown foundation the
concealers they're so nice so when they
pile it all into one palette it's just
so it's just so practical to me I think
it's like such a greeting to you and
that's like an I don't even only buy
online and I believe you are saving so
much money when you buy this palette I
don't personally have it myself but I
have used the foundations and I've use
the concealers and I think they're
beautiful so if you guys are interested
in doing a palette that has like good
quality items in it that's already done
and filled you don't have to fill it
yourself I would suggest doing the Bobbi
Brown concealer and foundation palette
the next item is from Beauty Blender and
this is the Beauty Blender Midas touch
which is a little holiday like duo and
it's $25 and the retail value is $28 so
you only save three bucks usually during
holiday you want to say a little bit
more than three books you know I'm
saying I'm just not the biggest fan
actually don't think it's very very cute
either I just think it's not like the
prettiest product I just don't think
it's worth it 25 bucks for this just to
be like a little kitschy little like in
a little ornament I just don't think
it's worth it whatsoever I think be
abundant of course is great they're 20
bucks and that's expensive
don't get me wrong it's an expensive
price point I don't think that buying
this Midas Touch kit is worth the extra
ebooks like just we're having a little
bit more of a solid cleanser it's it's
no but the Beauty Blender product that
is worth it to me is the gold mine set
that they have for holiday it comes with
two Beauty blenders it comes with
blotter Otzi blotting paper and it comes
with a cleanser it is $40 with a retail
value of 68 so you're saving $28 rather
than saving just three I think that that
gift set is so much better the goldmine
one is so much so much better I don't
even know why they came out with the -
when I'm like that good you getting so
much more bang for your buck when you're
spending a little bit more money so I
would suggest not going with the other
one get the goldmine because quality
okay guys so I have two more items first
one right here is going to be from Tarte
this is the limited edition
goddess glow highlighter rainforest of
the sea collection limited edition it
retails for $35 and it is the golden
champagne shade the packaging of it I
thought was really really cute very
adorable I loved the press on a house
like so beautifully embossed
but that was actually for me the the
highlighter was just too chunky and too
glittery I literally could not work with
it usually try such great ask face
products and I absolutely love the
products you guys know me and Tarte go
way back but this one was something that
I was kind of like it just like didn't
sit with me
didn't like the way it looked on my hand
I like the way it looked on my face it
was just too chunky and of course it
gave a glow it is a highlighter it
definitely made me glowy but it was like
glowing the way I didn't want to be it
was like chunky on my skin I mean I
really emphasize my texture even more
then I already have you do get 12 grams
of product though you get a lot so what
I would suggest instead is getting the
the Tarte Bazaar blush but this I'm
wearing it today again I literally have
been wearing this non-stop I've been
using these two colors mostly think this
is like they're my favorite of the
entire holiday like season finds this
baby is like 42 bucks and you get ten
blushes and this like really good like
easy to carry compact I don't know it
makes me like geeky with how much of a
good deal that is because I believe it
when I did the last video it's I said
that you like save 106 bucks like when
you're buying this so I'm like oh
actually I don't have two more that was
my last one I hope you guys enjoyed
today's video I hope you guys enjoyed my
suggestions on getting things from the
brand that are better or things I think
that is personally just a little bit
more cost efficient and a little bit
just better of a price point I really
actually enjoyed making this video is
actually so much fun I didn't really
think that I was being mean and any way
shape or form to the brands is just my
personal opinion and I hope the brands
understand that I'm not trying to be
shady towards you guys at all this is
just what I personally think but if
you guys take offense to it then okay I
don't
but honestly had an amazing amazing time
doing this video it was actually really
fun I kind of went to another one I'm
sweating a VC is off I don't know why I
don't know why in God's green earth it's
off no idea what it is so I'm gonna head
out now all the parts I talked about in
today's video will be linked down below
like I always do in every single video
and hope you guys had fun watching it it
was a night or day wherever you guys are

video happy holidays happy shopping I
