it's that time of the month not that
time of month but it's that time of
month so technical is going to be my
April 2015 beauty favorites I've been
living for in this past month these
videos are like my favorite videos to
film because I just feel like it's much
more personal I'm not like teaching it
I'd do anything I'm just explaining
products but I love and I want you guys
to have for this month I just think
these products are gonna be amazing for
anyone and I really say I talk about
them so should I get as much started or
should I just keep talking
like sure that Rogaine because I forgot
myth yeah without further ado let's get
into this let's get this bitch starting
turning on you you guys don't like this
kind of video and if I can watch it try
me
talk some on I come to try me
 by golly I didn't know that
that's right tournament I seriously have
so many products this month and I don't
know why I have so many products but I
just don't because I've been feeling
myself this month okay so we're talking
skincare first I am a huge advocate for
skincare actually have three skincare
products that I've been living for in
this past month it is the first day
beauty daily skin face cream the
oil-free non-comedogenic one so firstly
beauty is a brand insect Sephora and it
is a sensitive skin brand so for example
if you have sensitive skin and you need
like a lot of aid to your skin first day
of using be great for you guys because
it is geared toward people that are more
sensitive oily or dry or combination but
you are sensitive first a beauty is a
great brand to check out so this one the
reason I like it so much is because I am
oily combination and this is a very
lightweight moisturizer that I do two
cups of this all over the face before I
do my primer and my foundation and it
leaves me feeling so hydrated but it's
so lightweight it's almost like a watery
kind of formula what I also like about
is that you can like swiveled as ahead
and it'll like stop it from coming out
so looks like this why is that a perfect
circle that is the weirdest
thing I've ever seen okay what I love
about it so much too is that it dries so
fast into the skin absorbs really
quickly and it doesn't feel like I have
anything on but I do feel hydrated so I
really like that especially if you're
oily or combo you're gonna love it
trust me it's amazing another first
Beauty obsession like oh I love this so
much and the reason I even like I'm
talking about is because Kathleen is one
that she talked about in one of her
favorites videos triple eye remedy this
is a under-eye cream that you put on
during the date it's before you put on
concealer and stuff like that so what
about it is that this cooling sign that
you like it's like dirty clutches use it
today the cooling side is extremely
extremely cooling like when you put it
on like it feels like an ice cube is on
your eye it's so cool the actual serum
II part itself has an orange e tone to
it so it really does help neutralize the
under-eye super super nicely it's a very
lightweight I put it underneath my eyes
and it really helps cancel out any kind
of Darkness that I might have cuz it
does have the orange tone to it like I'm
going out and I don't want to like any
real I don't wanna wear any makeup but I
do have like darkness from like
allergies or something I'll put this on
to only heat put under my eye and I look
automatically brighter and automatically
more awake
so I think that this is a really great
under eye cream that also neutralizes
darkness and I think it's awesome I
think something like 20 bucks to its
first DVD is super cost-efficient and
it's amazing quality and I died for
first aid dying for first aid see what I
did there
probably not next one next skin care
item oh stop okay so I'm sure a bunch of
you have heard about this or like if
you're older or have really bad
allergies or really have bad bags then
you have heard of its chilling Angeles
by Genet's I think lotion s I could be
wrong this is actually most spots but I
took it from her room because this may
see what it is it is an under-eye cream
that literally like makes your bags go
away like it literally erases them off
your face for like six to eight hours I
think that's how long it was that's all
that's on me this is what a little
packet looks like it looks like this
it's like this little white kit with
like a serum inside basically so what
you do you take it out you like rip it
open I don't rip it open side one first
so you rip it open you put a little bit
like a very small amount on your finger
and it comes up pink you have to make it
clear you very lightly press it onto the
skin and it within two minutes all you
find you find yourself with like a fan
within two minutes all the bags that you
have underneath your eyes literally
disappear it is the weirdest thing ever
who love this freaking if you have bad
allergies and you have bags on your
husband's your allergies you'll love if
you have more wrinkles or things like
that down there you'll love it if you
crease really bad with concealer you
will love it I use this whenever I'm
going to an event so I used it when I
went to I'm out I used it when I went to
ever event recently I only you just want
to go out and events because I don't
want to it's so crazy like it literally
makes my undereyes look airbrushed it's
the weirdest thing ever I'm
gonna use this I can't wait to use this
on the camera like I want to show you
guys because I just got recently and I
have actually done it on camera yet cuz
I never wanted it always say on camera
but I just want to show you guys um and
my mom she's like really really into it
she's like obsessed with her she's only
mine gave me them actually I'm gonna try
to actually get her or maybe my grandma
on camera so I can show you guys at the
difference that happens with someone
that has bags I don't have really
intensive bags but my concealer does
crease on me sometimes so that's why I
like to use this for I can really talk
about the science behind it because I
don't really know everything about the
science behind it because it is like the
weirdest contraption ever but I
will leave a link down below where you
can find out and read about it and buy
it or whatever I'll leave all the info
down below with contacts and like
that so if you guys are interested it is
so amazing I was so shocked instantly
ageless check it out it is crazy it is
 crazy the next thing that we're
gonna be talking about is the Loreal Pro
that infallible foundation I am so
beyond obsessed with this foundation
from the drugstore like the thing with
me in the drugstore a lot of you know
but I love you don't I've never shopped
at the drugstore before I bought this
foundation I've never shopped at the
drugstore before this not even kidding
because my first experiences with makeup
was working at Sephora so that's all
irony was Sephora and Mac and like
higher end brands so for me it was
really hard to go buy things at this
drugstore when I didn't wear makeup out
on every day so you know what I mean so
it's like when I when I spend money on
these brands I'm not gonna be wearing
all the time when I get it for free at
Sephora so it was tough for me to buy it
it's still hard for me to buy at the
drugstore but I'm trying to venture into
it more and more and more because there
is gems and I think this is a
gym this is a diamond of the drugstore
so this one nation is a 24-hour Matt
foundation the coverage on your skin is
like a medium to full very buildable
it's beautiful on the skin it gives you
like a demi matte finish it's amazing it
stays on your skin all day long you
don't need to set it with the powder but
of course if you do it'll stay on a lot
longer if you are dry and you have dry
patches I don't think you're gonna like
this because it will pick up on the dry
patches of your face even with me like
it because I get more oily kamo if I
would dry Patrick over here and I'm
using this foundation it will pick up on
that dry patch so I really that really
 pisses me off about this so I
need to use hydrating primers on the
outside of my face but everything else
about this I just love it and I'm
press with l'oreal for making this
foundation this is a high-end that
is so next two items are bronzers
that I've been living for okay the Amiga
forever
number 20 matte bronzer it is everything
this powder is the most gorgeous
terra-cotta matte bronzer but I say Matt
it's not like a flat matte it gives you
like a nice dimension to the skin it's
absolutely gorgeous
I like these with a fluffy brush just
kind of blend it into my temples or my
cheekbone area it just gives me this
beautiful dimension to the skin very
smooth it looks like this and like this
beautiful terracotta warm tone to it
it's stunning it's absolutely stunning
and I think that if you're a guy if
you're a girl anyone will absolutely
love this bronzer I remember when I
talked about it for the first time
someone sent me a Twitter look like the
tweet that was like mani like how trying
to buy it that bronzer you suggested but
it's sold a lot Sephora now and I'm like
well that wasn't me if it is sold out
they just make if ever just came out
with new bronzers like stop they have
this insane like riveting
so basically make your favorite bronzers
aren't just life pro bronze fusion or
just the regular bronzing powders from
them you will be happy honestly that you
will love them I think that their new
formula is absolutely amazing I'm using
it on my face today I am wearing the new
the new bronzing formula by Makeup
Forever I'm wearing it in the color 20 M
and it should feel like it gives me this
beautiful bronzy glow but it's not too
warm it's not too cool it's literally
like the most neutral bronzer I have
it's amazing so if the name forever one
number twenty is out of stock still try
the bigger forever the new school the
new ones new one right here and that's
more of a kulish gray tone this is the
number 20 which is more of a terracotta
like warm bronzer so if you guys are
into the warmth and that warm needs like
I am it the number 20 met bronze and if
not if you guys are into more of like a
glow glow without it being too warm try
out the new Pro bronze fusions because
they are amazing they didn't they
launched like six or seven or two
perfect items the blush that I have been
going on almost Berkeley for literally
like I took this that way with me I've
been wearing this like every day I've
been wearing makeup I've been wearing
this like today's like the first day I
have not wear
which is like a shocker it is the wild
honey blush by Becca it looks like this
and thank you little Becca packaging
this is adorable
it's basically like a burnt orange a
apricot color oh my god it's so gorgeous
I love the backup powders in general
because they just make the most smooth
and beautiful powders let me swatch it
next to this it looks like it could be
the other bronzer I'm such a weirdo but
it's as beautiful just burnt orange
color it looks like this it's like a
peachy burnt orange it is matte but it
gives you a slight sheen to the face so
if you put this on it's not gonna be
completely flat it will have a slight
sheen to it but it's absolutely
beautiful it's very pigmented you do not
need a lot of it with the becca blushes
or highlighters you guys know if you
guys have tried becca stuff you know
they're as pigmented as so you
don't need me this is like my piece
too
I just want to bring them up for like
honorable mention kind of thing I just
want to talk about this color really
quickly by drawing cosmetics it is the
new underground lipstick by Gerard it's
like this topi greyish color when this
launched it didn't really really well I
think it sold out in a couple days it's
a back in stock now but I just want to
swatch it on my hand really quickly just
to show you guys what the color looks
like it is a dupe for the in cashmere
lime crime color this is what it looks
like it's a deep greyish taupe it's
absolutely beautiful it's not my kind of
color though like this is not my tone
this is not like the kind of thing that
I like but for those of you who are
really into like cashmere and really
into like that kind of like DB topi
brownish gray kind of color that's some
of your colors then you guys will
literally be obsessed with underground
it is absolutely amazing it is a satin
finish it's not as a matte as obviously
the line cream ones are but it's really
beautiful and you can always put like
translucent powder over top of it to
make it matte and then my second drug
product I want to talk about is coral
craze gloss by gerard which is actually
the gloss I'm wearing today
on top of Berlin liquid lipstick by Kat
Von D which looks like this I love this
color so much because it gives you a
coral tone to literally everything it's
perfect for it for summer for spring I
love corals and summer in the spring I
love that my kind of warm bronzy glow
with a coral lip I think it's so
gorgeous I think it's such a beautiful
color and it looks good on literally
everyone let me go and swatch some coral
craze on my hand it is literally a true
coral it's beautiful it's so beautiful I
would not suggest doing a gloss over a
very mattifying liquid lipstick because
it will become
really sticky on your lips but I was
like you know what I'm just gonna I'm
just gonna forfeit it into sacrifice the
stickiness because I love the
combination I think it looks stunning
but that's when I talk about coral craze
because it is one of the most beautiful
shades of George cosmetics and I think
that it's not talked about enough
Stephanie one of my top five and they
have like a lot of glosses so top five
coral craze that's amazing I don't
really awesome codes with drug stuff
I'll leave everything linked up below
there are affiliate links I'm gonna let
you guys know that right now I do
actually of a coach for a gloss and a
lipstick combination and I've never had
that before I've never had that before
with Gerard so you gotta do a gloss and
lipstick for 20 bucks and I think that's
such a good deal honestly like I've only
heard deals that were like $30 and $40
so for those of you who really can't
spend 30 or 40 dollars on lipsticks and
lipglosses I think that a twenty dollar
combo is absolutely amazing and I hope
you guys can definite Art isn't one of
my favorite brands and they're one of
the first brands I ever started using
when I started YouTube and my Instagram
and they've been with me the whole way
even with me for so long and I
wholeheartedly believe in their brand
and I love their codes that they give
people like the the bundle I'm talking
about I think it's the create your own
bundle and it's forty three dollars but
with the code mani two lips I believe
I'll leave everything down below if I'm
wrong you get it for $20 and you
literally that's literally saving like
55% oh it's so I think that's a really
great deal and if you're interested
please check it out down below and I
will leave everything linked of course
as always because I what's next you guys
know this is coming you guys new be pls
highlighting powders specifically in the
color Sunkist it is the most beautiful
golden bronze highlighter ever like it
is so ridiculously beautiful and it's a
very pigmented it is a loose powder
which I hate I hate loose powder
highlighters I just need loose powder in
general I don't like loose powder I just
don't like just no but I think that
these are beautiful and I think that I
think you only like ten bucks and I'm
really shocked it was a total 95 I can't
remember how much they were but they
were definitely cheaper than like some
other highlighters that are in those
powder form that are similar to this I
love them I think you guys should
definitely check out the tls
highlighters and give them a chance
they're beautiful they mate just go
ahead and swatch on my finger because I
will know if this on my face right now
cuz it's in pain like a dildo swatch can
you see that reflection I don't know if
you guys can and if you are medium to
dark and complexion you will love it
if you're lighter in complexion it will
be a little bit darker on you because it
is a
or highlighter so Jenny be careful with
it because it will look a little bit
dark upon you but have your medium to
deep in complexion it will be me on you
okay next obviously can you talk about
these then you makeup geek foiled
shadows okay now all twenty or near as
well they look like these are the new
