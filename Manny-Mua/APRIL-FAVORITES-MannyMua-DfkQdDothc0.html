okay so we are in April of 2016 let's
get into the favorites so the first
favorite of the month usually I like to
go in with my skincare first but this is
gonna we're breaking the rules today and
you know why we're breaking the rules
because this yeah so have you guys did
not know these are my lipsticks with
offer on cosmetics we collaborated and
created three lipstick colors fairies
charmed and hypno all three shades I
created with them Ares is a really
really beautiful soft peachy pink nude
charmed is this beautiful like dusty
rose like deep dusty rose color and
hypno is a very nice clump burgundy
shade I seriously love all three colors
I mean if you guys got them I really
hope you guys are loving them I'm so
happy to be seeing you guys getting them
and you guys posting them on Twitter I'm
trying to repost as many of you guys
wearing the UM the lipsticks as I can on
my Twitter because I'm just I just
really really appreciate it the fact you
guys got them and you guys are wearing
them and your guys are showing support
over a lipsticks or like one of my
favorite of all time liquid lipsticks
they're so beautifully done and so I
just really hope that you guys are
liking them I'm actually in discussion
right now with Ofra to maybe bring back
the shades again because they were a
limited edition so you might actually
bring them back another time or even
make them permanent me and know from
beginning so many requests from people
to not only bring them back but to make
them permanent cuz people are lacking
the shades a lot you know what like this
video if you guys want these shades to
be permanent and you guys want them to
come back like it's okay I can actually
show and prove Topher Beck Hey look all
these legs they wanna I think they're
absolutely amazing and I could not be
happier with this collaboration so let
me know if you guys want these to be
brought back and to be permanent oh I
hope you guys say yes please they have
since I already sarted talking about the
lipsticks we're just gonna go on with
the lip route the second lipstick that
I've been gagging for all month is this
shade right here this is jeffree star
cosmetics Gemini lipstick this lipstick
you guys make me so fuckin giddy I just
want to scream it's just such a
beautiful terracotta nude shade it's
nice because I feel like I don't have a
lot of nude colors like this or even any
new colors like this it's absolutely
beautiful let me swatch on my hand high
pigment come on that's stunning it's
just such a beautiful dusty Terracotta
rose color it's literally like as rose
in a terra cotta in it Geoffrey you did
such an amazing job with this lips that
you killed it so much
see I love Jeffery stars liquid
lipsticks there's such a beautiful
formula there so a pig in Pig Morton but
there's like such a nice lightweight
formula that dries very very beautifully
it doesn't feel like they're like dry
and cakey on the lips whatsoever they're
very very nice and lightweight but still
so pigmented and just absolutely
stunning and they just give like the
best full coverage appearance on the
lips and I think they're amazing and I'm
not just saying that because Jeffrey's
one of my closest friends
yes me and Jeffrey are like this and
we're like bitches til death but that
really honestly when it comes to this on
YouTube that doesn't mean anything
because this is about me and you guys
and about our honesty with each other
and I want you guys to know that I truly
believe that Jeffrey started liquid
lipsticks aren't absolutely amazing and
especially the shade
Gemini if you guys can get your hands on
it because it's seriously so good
Jeffrey you guys killed it I love you
and then the last lip item I want to
talk about for this month is the Marc
Jacobs gloss in French tickler this
gloss
oh no it's done it's fucking done the
Marc Jacobs glosses already are such a
beautiful formula they're so glossy and
they're so lightweight and they feel
like just absolutely amazing they're not
too sticky they're not goopy they're
just such a beautiful consistency and I
absolutely love them another great gloss
by that mist sugar sugar I started using
that one after Jacqueline told me about
sugar sugar she said that it was such a
beautiful gloss and I was like you know
what okay let me try that in la style so
after I tried that one I was like I need
more mm-hmm so I got French tickler
which is a beautiful like coral with the
most slight subtle purple pink like
glitter reflect and it's so so soft so
subtle I'm wearing hearing it out on top
of the lipstick I'm wearing I just like
this color it's gonna be such a hit this
is it right here
I like this colors doing such a
beautiful hit for spring and summer and
just a beautiful like lightweight coral
it's not super pigmented as you can see
but it gives you a nice beautiful like
glossy shine I'm not kidding you like
once you go into Sephora and look at
this gloss and swatch it in your hand
you'll be like oh okay I do need it so
go to Sephora check it out you guys can
get your hands on it cuz it's just so
freakin pretty and I just think it's
gonna be such a good gloss for summer
and spring
I can I can just feel in my bones okay
great so let's go and talk about some
skincare entries now that I've bounced
down from lips to skin so I won't talk
about this really quickly because I have
used this every single night since I
got it every single night and I got this
maybe three or four weeks ago this is
the drunk elephant virgin a morula
luxury facial oil
honestly like I just wanna bite a little
Heather thing ingredients 100% unrefined
sclera Kyra beer IRA are we gonna read
those things marula kernel oil so this
is 100% oil like it's a hundred percent
like there's no extra preservatives
there's just no anything but you don't
need it in oil this is just a pure
facial oil that's great for hydration
and anti aging that's what I've heard
that the marula oil is good for is like
hydration and anti-aging benefits and I
have noticed that with this oil I would
go every single day more refresh and
more hydrated and my face feels so much
more plump of the three weeks I've had
in the four weeks I've had it maybe I've
gone two days without it and I noticed a
difference so now I'm like shit like
this is part of my routine like this is
part of my freakin routine so if you
guys are interested in trying a really
nice just luxury face oil
I would doesn't try out the drunken
elephant one this one is inside Sephora
this is my last step in my routine every
single night after I moisturize
I just dude like literally three drops
on my hand rub them together and just
like press into the skin like nice and
just press it in now I really do feel
like my face has been so much more
hydrated and just like well nourished
throughout this entire month and I know
it's because of this I'll definitely
check out the drunk elephant luxury face
oil the virgin marula it's beautiful
okay this one is kind of skincare item
more of a like luxury just fine item
this is a bath bomb from lush so if you
guys follow me on social media on
snapchat or on Instagram you guys know
that hype visited Vancouver this month
with lush cosmetics they flew me in my
mom how to just kind of see the facility
just kind of show us the new launches
for Mother's Day that are coming up and
it was just the most amazing experience
I really cannot thank you guys at lush
enough for making this such an awesome
experience for me and my mom it's just
cool cuz like I've always wanted my mom
to travel and I've always wanted such
amazing things for her because she's
done so much for me in my life and now
that I can actually pay things forward
and it's been such a blessing to like
realize that you know like coming for
where I come from you know what I mean
like growing up Mormon just being it's
been the struggle with like everything I
just feel really blessed and I want to
thank you guys again my ex were just
making that happen
and thank you guys have left for
inviting my mom and me to comfort of and
Cooper I've never been out of the
country really I've been to Cancun ones
but Vancouver
it was like my first out of the country
experience like a real experience so it
was just absolutely amazing
this backbone right here like I made
this one that's why it's like covered in
this thing you can literally like see
it's like I made it cuz I want to give a
shout out to them I absolutely love the
lush bath bombs in general like their
bath bombs of all the brands I've tried
two bath bombs because there's brands
that try to create them too lucious is
the best by far
like they're just so creative and so
inventive in the fact that like they
showed us the facility and when they say
handmade bitch bitch they're so handmade
that you're literally cutting up fruits
and vegetables and mixing up honey up in
this bitch like I was like this is
manual labor like they are literally
like making my house own work we made
the brazen honey mask oh I was sweating
I was fucking sweating like a piglet in
church you're just so cool to see that
like that's living what they do full
time they take handmade and hand poured
so seriously like they've really have
any machines there they literally like
in the cup like if you buy a a mask
their hand pouring that like that mask
into the cup what brand fucking does
that I'm so sorry
I think lush is such an awesome freaking
company and I just wanna say thank you
guys again for writing me and seeing the
backend of your guys's company like
seeing how you guys do things it's just
such a cool experience my mom just died
on the trip she was so obsessed so thank
you guys again I'm not really sure which
the backbone this is it's like going
with little the green here or it looks
kind of like a little nipple like a
little chichi I don't know I don't know
what what this one's called but I made
that one myself and I was like it was
cute so next thing I have to talk about
is one a little brush for the month this
is the morphe M 210 brush where the fuck
have I been and where has this brush
been in my life hmm this is such an
amazing little packing brush for
eyeshadow it's so freakin good it's a
natural airbrush so it's great at
applying shadow that's where it is how
it really uses for cream or for glitter
or anything but for shadow this is such
a nice brush look at the size of this
beautifully cut beautifully shape just
like perfect amount of denseness picks
up product nicely deposits product
nicely I think this is Larry's like 3 or
4 bucks maybe 5 but it's absolutely
amazing it you guys can get your hands
on one of these guys just for a nice
packing I am a morphe affiliate if you
guys are interested you can always use
my code mani MUA to save you guys money
if you guys want to you're gonna save
10%
I mean it's 10% isn't a lot but you know
what I give your bike
a lot of things like that had it's like
big city getting like free shipping
sometimes so I'm just saying if you guys
would want to save some money
use the code man anyway but I definitely
suggest getting two more feet hem to ten
with whatever purchases from morphe or
if you guys are by the burping store you
can also use my code inside the store so
pick this guy up the M 210 it's freaking
amazing as a packing brush like oh it's
so good I use it today
let's talk about a couple of eyeshadows
that have been mmm gagging these are the
L'Oreal infallible shadows you guys I
don't know where the fuck I was and I
don't know what train stuff that I got
off on before I hit this stop where were
you in my life the L'Oreal infallible
shadows are basically like the drugstore
version of a foible shadow there your
gonna gag to this cute little tub you
know yeah I know I just like they speak
for themselves
I don't even have to say anything just I
just showed you the swatch this is in
the shade
amber rush that's my actual favorite
color and also really love the color
bronze taupe I've actually used up both
of these on my channel already and I
just think they're absolutely amazing
quality shadows are so buttery this so
pigmented there's such a high shine and
I just I really think that L'Oreal
killed it and like hit the nail on the
head with this formulation I think
they're so good such an amazing price
such an amazing formula and I really
like I have nothing bad to say about
them they're beautiful they don't crease
easily as long as you're using like a
nice primer on your lids like they're
just freakin bomb one foundation that
has taken the cakes for this month is
the ko Gendo aqua foundation Kogan doko
Gendo not really try to pronounce it but
this own nation guys honestly is
ridiculously beautiful on the skin I've
seen this circulating to YouTube forever
for fucking ever and I never tried it I
was like you know what it's fine like I
don't know why I never picked it up I
don't know why is it inside Sephora in
sites of forest though like that could
be why except maybe I've never seen it
it is such a beautiful lightweight
foundation that gives you still a good
amount of coverage but it looks so
natural and flawless it is make sure
skin looks like it's very hydrated and
plump and very just effortlessly
beautiful that's honest like I don't
know how to explain it other than that I
use this in a tutorial that's coming
and I feel like my skin just looks so
beautiful and it didn't settle in fine
lines the coverage was very buildable I
only needed like two to three pumps for
the whole face my Jeff a man face like
look at this no sighs then come on and
you have a big face this is pricey as
hell it's like fifty five dollars or
something crazy but honestly like
honestly I think it's stunning again I
am more on the oily side and this is
more of a aqua luminous foundation so I
would definitely suggest setting it with
a translucent powder as well as using a
silicon based primer underneath it just
to make sure that you can like really
keep the oils of your face at bay so
this foundation can do what it does best
without your oils interfering you know
what I mean I'm in the shade one two
three I honestly just absolutely love it
if you guys can get a hold of it
definitely do it I mean if you need to
pay your rent pay your rent first pay
the fucking rent first because this
foundation ain't cheap and last but not
least this is my last item of the day of
the favorites this is the Urban Decay
afterglow 8 hour powder highlight in the
shade sin it's actually the highlight
I'm wearing today this is the kind of
highlight that is gonna be like you're
gonna be walking in a room and a bitch
will catch the highlight like oh like
it's gonna blind you like that is what
this is like it's that kind of highlight
look at this look at that look how
highly reflective and intense this is
like that is crazy it makes you look at
a very very white champagne shade what I
love about this highlighter is because
not only is it so like bright and
intense and light beaming it has a gold
undertone it's gonna be flattering on so
many different types of skin tones like
are liking the lightest complexions to
even like some of the deepest
complexions like it's gonna look
beautiful on you because it doesn't have
that nice gold undertone of course if
you're deeper and complexion you might
want to use it a little bit more
sparingly than someone that was a little
bit lighter this is coming with me into
New York like it is good like look at
this shit if you guys are into that
beaming intense like crazy glow like not
glow from within but glow from down the
outside then you guys are gonna be into
the shade of sin from urban decay and
that's it guys
that is it for the entire April
