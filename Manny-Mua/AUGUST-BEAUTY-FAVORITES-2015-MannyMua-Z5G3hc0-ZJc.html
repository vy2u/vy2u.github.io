whatever that's my first favorite is you
guys you guys are always my favorites I
just don't always say you're my
favorites but you're always in my
favorite let me first things first I
like to go in with skincare first you
guys know I'm a skincare bitch so let me
go and start off with this lip balm but
I've been really really really really
liking
it's from Sarah Happ I didn't want to
say only no I hope that's how you
pronounce it Sarah happy to hop very
hippie hmm and it's called the lip slip
1 luxe balm had it for about like a week
and I've done pretty pretty good into it
it's not gonna focus on its it focused
oh my god stop I got an auto focusing
camera uh how I use this product is I
could use this at my time it's like my I
basically use it as a good lip mask I
put it on every single night before I go
to bed but like right before I'm about
to go to bed because it is so thick this
bitch is so thick it is really
thick how many times I just say thick
thing either you can find at a Nordstrom
it was sent to me by like the PR people
that work with them but um I tried it
out I actually really liked it I
would not use this during the day though
because it is very heavy on the lips
like almost like too intense on the lips
like I'm like it's kind of sticky but I
literally will fall asleep with this on
and I wake up with it it's still on so
I'm like this bitch is good and I'm
going to bed with my ass like tossing
and turning all night wake up and I stop
some of this on my lips and you know
this bitch is bomb a face wash I've been
using all month long
it's the glam girl thirsty cleanse daily
hydrating cleanser it looks live huh if
folks I'm never never this focusing
thing what the ha what I truly love
about this cleanser is that it really is
hydrating cleanser I've been using this
every single morning to the past month
and I think it's absolutely amazing I
use it in the morning as soon as I wake
up and it just I just feel so much more
rejuvenated and so much more fresh and
not stripped whatsoever on my face like
my face feels so hydrated when I use it
it's not like a normal like face wash
were like it strips the skin almost like
you're cleaning your face and you feel
kind of like oh it feels kind of tight
afterwards this literally feels you
feeling like kind of supple this is the
small sized version of it like 20 bucks
at Sephora I wasn't like sure I was
gonna like it somewhere on the whole
east side I love buying little samples
at Sephora like in their little like go
to section like skincare items because I
don't want to ever try out brand new
thing that's like huge and have to
return x8 and work for me so I like to
buy a little like many samples of X it's
always it's always wait it's always way
cheaper than the big one obviously so
how about a little mini sample of it
hoping that out lucky and I love it
someone ought to go buy the full
one because it's almost done
less skincare item of the month Korres
Greek yogurt and Matt's nourishing
sleeping facial this is what it looks
like it looks like these this is a
sleeping facial that I like to sleep
with like three times a week it is the
nicest most hydrating sleeping facial
mask that I've ever used ever I like
this more than the glam glow like the
hydrating glam glow and basically I'm
obsessed with this and I like this more
than any other sleeping moisturizer or
cream or I think that for hydration when
I wake up after this literally I feel
like a baby's sign like a fatass
die like a supple filter so supple and
so soft and I'm just like I wanna buy my
own face that's what I feel like you
know you see a fat ass baby thine your
son you wanna eat that look guys that's
how I feel with my face after this it's
funny cuz I got Patrick into using this
at home I was like use this one night
like when I was like staying with him he
tried it and he loved it so he bought
his own that was a moisturizer so he's
been using every single day he said my
skin feels so good this thing is
so good I looked at his bottle it was
like almost done on my bitch you just
bought it what the and he's like
I've been using it everyday and I'm like
why it's a mask like it's a it's a
nourishing mask it's like tops of
moisturizer and I was like no you
 bitch it's not he loves it and I
love it I just think it's a really great
item especially for all skin types
even if you are only like me and Patrick
I love to be hydrated and I would
definitely suggest this for sure found
at Sephora next is another like really
random item I want to just toss in here
because I'm obsessed this is the vanilla
bean marshmallow candle by Bed Bath and
Beyond I know is that somebody works
yeah oh where are you now oh so
this candle as you can see it's my
second one I'm obsessed with the vanilla
bean marshmallow smell holy titties
on the floor it's seriously one of the
most amazing smelling things I've ever
smelled my whole entire family that
comes in my room be like you're miss
 so good I'm like I know fall
right I feel like it smells so holiday
and rich just smelling the vanilla bean
marshmallow just smell it smell the
bitch and you will die
and gag thousand gaggles you watch me
you know if I could because the two lip
products don't talk about really quickly
our tireless Aussie Beverly Hills and no
the new liquid lips except she just came
out with they just launched I think
seven colors for fall it's like their
new like Fall collection colors and I've
been obsessing I mean this one is really
help this is the color Veronica
I've been obsessing with this color for
some reason it's like this deep gorgeous
like Mavi looks like this I was wearing
this in my last video I was wearing it
in my Q&amp;amp;A video a lot people were like
what color is that that you're wearing
even though I left an inscription where
you guys I will always leave stuff like
in the description bar
Veronica is seriously one of the most
beautiful shades me just watch the bitch
because I'm kind of hot
do you know brain oh I know it's like a
very deep lush brown pink that's all
just kinda sighs wanna see like it's
hard to describe a color like this
because there's so many so much
dimension in it but it's absolutely
beautiful it's very warm it's so
stunning the other one I threw over with
one I'm wearing right now it's called
dusty rose it's very similar to this
like almost identical we just want
jehovah it's a much more light pinky
version of the other color I think it's
absolutely beautiful it kind of reminds
me of a darker version of serenity like
the one by jar the one like clubbed with
it's like a darker version of that and
it has a lot more mob to it as well it's
not as like pinky Brown it's much more
like mafi deeper in tone than sorry
thinking for example if you're like
darker and complexion and you wore any
and you want it to look like a little
bit darker on you I would definitely try
to go for dusty rose or Veronica also I
think that autist hacia revamp their
formula like the first couple I've ever
got mono sauce yeah I did like they were
really nice and I loved them but I feel
like I was obsessing over the newest
formula I think they're so good I think
it's even creamier and it's even more
Lucy than the last ones were it isn't
that bad luck in the past with like
Anasazi illiberal lipsticks or anything
like that like you guys don't like them
trying to get them like now because I
feel like they've revamped their formula
I don't know if that's just me let me
know if you guys have had like anything
that um I'm like obsessing with them
there right now I've talked to a
about get into it or get out next item
is the so random like I just another
little discovery of mine out of this
 lit this is the bare minerals
concealer and well rested it's a little
powder why did I never know about this
 powder now wait for me I use as
a brightening powder this is like some
powerful this is
 powerful it reminds me of like a
mixture of the Kat Von D like yellow
powder mixed with like mac emphasize
that brightening that really intense
brightening effect that's what this
reminds me of it is such an intense
powder though like you don't need a lot
of it you need a very small amount or a
bowl gonna cover up a truck on
your eye like it is concealer powder
that gets concealer has like a banana
color tone I had swatches on my head
previously look at that I would
definitely try it out go to like Sephora
swatch it on your hand and be amazed
so brightening I'm like God
beating from the sky bright bareMinerals
well rested do my tums store bought two
more key items to learn more from morphs
first one is a brush just like every
single favorites video I include some
type of brush in today's no different
bitches it's no different at all here
this is the morphine 439 I talked about
this so many times on my channel before
it's their big buffing brush I just feel
like I have my stages you know how my
stages with some I'll go through my
B butter face and I'll go through my M
429 phase this buffing brush is so good
dad um honestly this is like one of my
favorite foundation brushes ever in
buffs out product beautifully it is so
dense like gets as hell
I think doesn't harbor bacteria it
synthetic it is large in circumference
so it covers a wide variety of my face
at a time it is such a good brush I
honestly think that you cannot go wrong
with the morphe and 439 for any face
shape any like a face size either it's
just such a great brush you use it for
your neck and you know don't front body
look at that they don't huge that
is that body body body body body
I like apply with this and that goal
might be butter around like the areas
I'm like kind of cracky and so
apply with this get flawless as well and
then I'll go on my beauty butter to kind
of take off like excess product and then
just look so good the next multi product
is the 35o palette by morphe policy 35
oh 35o palette is seriously one of the
best morphe palette in real lunch if not
the best palette they've ever launched
freakishly amazing let's just look at it
ah implement perennial bomb the reason
I'm obsessed with this freaking power so
much is because I think
it's such a beautiful warm palette if
you guys are not into warms this might
not be the time for you if you're an
intimate cool tones but you guys know
I'm like enough warm tone not see and
I'm absolutely obsessed with warm tones
and this palette is just the warmest up
with a warm like you can't go wrong with
this badge you can
what I also like like about the 3500 is
I feel like compared to other market
palettes which are also great they are
great palette I just like this one like
felt even better I just feel like
they're revamping their formula and I
feel like they're like just going in
like they're beating the
game up right now there's like
beauty world I can knock in the bitches
out in the v-world because it's so good
let's watch couple I mean might as well
let's watch some you want C to look like
Miami boy every one of me gag-worthy the
gallery is real I don't know if this is
gonna be a stock where I'm talking about
this because me and Jacqueline have been
going Gnarls Barkley over this
palette like we both are absolutely
obsessed and we were talking about it so
much that it sold out like crazy I mean
it's on me
pritchards Jacqueline Jacqueline's one
that sold this bitch out like
crazy but I was talking about this so
much like on my snapchats with that but
it is so that right now I think when it
comes back I'll let you guys know on my
social media platforms like Twitter
snapchat all that bullying Oh more if
you just killing me and they're
just making my kitties wet
that's how good it is make them a little
taste
Wow anything from morphe as always I
have a code with martini anyway in all
caps will save you 10% off everything
you know I'd like to tell you guys that
I'm an affiliate with them they're my
favorite affiliate brand to be part of I
just think they're absolutely amazing
and they're just they're good people and
they're good products I just can't stop
talking about them one of my favorites
to ever work with and I just think more
fees killing the game right now
and their palettes that are coming out
right now
 sling if you're into more
neutrals the 35 and that they just
launched right now it's gonna be such a
great alternative I don't have that with
me right now
but it's such a good alternative if you
guys don't want a lot of orange e shade
so you want more neutral and classy and
 look like that's amigo too so
don't try my last August I don't know I
feel so sad one favorite swirl Brooks
I'm like boom my last item is the
two-sided Z palette this is this in this
Miss so it's a two-sided
it opens up in both ways like that this
has been my favorite for a long time I
just forget to talk about it because it
just such a routine for me that I'm like
Oh duh like don't have to that but I've
been using this bitch for months months
like this is my travel one actually if
you dislike like this at all times
because this is my traveling Z palette
these are all the shadows I travel with
when I
they look like this and then these are
the blushes and so like that I travel
with when I travel so it's just so
convenient like having your eyeshadows
in one side and having your face
products in the other I just think a
two-sided Z palette is so great anything
that's two-sided that you can put like
multiple things in I'm like all game for
because it's like Hello yes like yeah I
don't really know exactly where to find
these I think it's on the Z palette so
you can find them I'll leave everything
linked down below as always like I do
with everything in every video ah if
you're a makeup artist if you like to
travel a lot please get something like
this because it's so convenient I really
promise you it is I mean it's kind of
bulky don't get me wrong it is kind of
bulky but you want it to be able to be
sturdy enough wear it like things
wouldn't break if you were to toss it to
the side and has a lot of cushion so
yeah that's it
that's it everybody medley with feel
