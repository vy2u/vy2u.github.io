honestly one of most amazing experiences
I've ever had in my entire life it was
just so incredible but I had been gone
for two weeks but luckily I did have
three films content up for you guys so I
was like you know what I'm Way out of
town but I'm gonna have videos up so
that's why I have been uploading even
though I've been gone for two weeks I
missed you guys
there's something about coming back that
really makes me like I miss filming and
I miss being with you guys so yeah today
zooming by August favorites I cannot
believe it's already freakin August soon
we're gonna be in September which is
fall season in October and Halloween and
I'm just so stoked this is like my
favorite kind of season I love doing
fall makeup the warms and the oranges
and the neutrals and like the
cranberries and the purples like it's
just it gives me so much life in prison
with a bitch realness yeah
let's see let's just get right into this
August favorites as always if you like

like me please I'll watch it you
know the Jo with that why do you guys do
like this video please give it a thumbs
up and subscribe if you aren't already
and if you knew what's up I'm Manny Mui
and welcome to my channel thank you guys
for being here really appreciate it
let's go and get into this August
favorites video
okay so let's start with the more
unconventional items first so my first
favorite of the entire month which I'm
sure you guys have will probably guess
if you guys follow me on snapchat you
guys should if you guys don't snapchat
men anyway check it out right here
yeah I've been wearing these sunglasses
by style sector all month long I'm so
obsessed with these glass actually I've
been wearing last two month let's be
real this is what they look like on my
eyes I just think there's such a cool
sick ass like metallic looking pair of
glasses and they're just super cool I
think they're called the Avant green I
don't really know exactly what they're
called but leave a link down below of
course I think they're really really fun
and I think they compliment a lot of
different people and I think that
there's such a pretty queue a spare man
come on with that I will say though that
they are not the best quality sunglasses
they're not like oh my god so sturdy
these are not Dior and Chanel
like they're not that sturdy but they're
cutest I'm aware you have the
wrong designer
mm-hmm so next favorite I have been
loving is the Luna sleeping at night oil
by Sunday Riley um this has been all
over on Instagram I've seen it before
and on YouTube and whatnot but I for
some reason I just have a hard time like
falling into trends and buying something
because it's like trendy so I didn't
buying this like months and months later
when I was shopping on Sephora online
had seen this so much previously so I'm
like I'll go try this out and see what I
think about the Sunday Riley night oil
and I love it it is such a nice
sleeping oil it's supposed to help
reduce the appearance of pores and fine
lines and wrinkles and I do feel like
when I use this and I wake up the next
day my pores look smaller and you know
you're fake like you know your face you
know what I mean like and I know my face
I know my pores my another big
and I know when I look in the mirror on
my day look at those craters
like I know they're there if I use
something that says that's gonna
minimize my pores and I wake up the next
day and I see that important are
minimized slightly even if it's just a
small amount they're still minimized and
I'm like dude this actually works
so if you guys have problems with big
pores small fine lines and wrinkles and
things like that I would definitely
check out the sleeping oil I use it
every single night now because it's
seriously like in my ritual like I can't
stop using this get a sample from
Sephora I think they'll do samples for
you I'm not really quite sure but
doesn't try to I mean try not for like
one night
and see what you think because honestly
like I thought this is actually really
really really great in I'm so happy I
found this actually this is my last step
is after I use moisturizer put this all
over my face it kind of smells funny
like kind of black like her if she and I
hate the smell of black licorice I
 hate it
but honestly when something tells me
it's gonna work if it works then okay
dude I'm gonna use this and I'm gonna
repart to say when I'm out even though
it's expensive let's talk about
two lip products I have been living for
in this path look basically what I have
been really into recently it has been a
hybrid glossy lip not only just like a
gloss I've been wanting like a high
intense shine gloss so what I've been
really loving are these two bad boys
right here this is a Cicely final lip
star and it's basically a glide it's in
the shade diamond and then this is these
you a skinny dip if you follow me on
snapchat you know all about jus a skinny
dip they're like the same thing but
different the same time the Cicely final
star is a clear glass with micro-fine
intense glitter and it gives you a
really really cool glossy lip shine
that's what I'm wearing on my lips right
now let me reapply it's like a cute
little thing brushy one I do do you see
that it just gives you the most sick-ass
intense shine I love it honestly I don't
remember how much this is I do remember
seeing it on what what beauty lash this
is on beauty lashes website but it's
like 40 bucks for 45 like something
crazy and honestly gy skinny-dip is
really really really similar except a
consistency is different and it will add
a little bit of color because this has
more of a gold shine to it so I'm just
gonna swatch it on my hand just so I can
see the difference really really quickly
Joyce has more of a golden metallic
reflect inside like a diamond effect
unlike this is Lee phyto slip star so
it's definitely more of a white multi
colored does what they look like as you
can see they're very very intense very
similar one is just more cool tone and
wants a little bit more warm tone and
once really expensive a one's definitely
not that expensive the G way one is $16
this is the one is 45 I love them both
but you're on a budget I would
definitely suggest this skinny dip by
joy again I do have a code which way you
can use the code Manion your way to save
yourself 15% off if you want no pressure
at all about just letting you know that
you can save some money if you guys want
to I just been really loving
really high intense shine and the Sicily
fighter lip star and diamond and
skinny-dip has been getting it to me and
if I can live it like my titties just
move okay so laughs lip product that I
have is the urban decay 24/7 glide on
pencil in the shade it's stark-naked
you guys this lip liner has been my
saving grace I don't know what it is
about this lip liner but I've been
loving it so much like literally look
how much I have left like this bitch has
gone through it lean in ringing on with
my lizard looks like I'm just gonna show
the shade next to it it's a very
beautiful neutral nude shade it's not
too pink it's not too Brown it's not too
peach it's literally like the epitome of
a nude lip liner that I want that's it's
littering everything I want it's
actually the color I have underneath my
lips right now I lined my entire lips
with this and just put the final lip
start over and that's what I have all my
lips that's that's all I got
I just been really honestly living and
breathing for this lip liner if you guys
ever have tried the urban decay lip
liners they're absolutely amazing so
smooth so creamy they don't budge and
they're just like they're just there and
they're balm so I definitely doesn't
check them out they're stunning
in China all over my neck if you guys
are into nude lipsticks and want a nude
lip liner that really complements so
many different nudes whether it's a pink
of brown a peachy one a more really
light one I would definitely shade stark
naked by Urban Decay just go to support
swatch on your hand you'll see how nice
this lip liner is especially for people
that are lighter in collection to my
complexion to even medium skin tones
this one right now has been my go-to lip
liner Orton is good two brushes
I really want to talk about quickly
because I've already talked about the
most abstract are some of the new Rose
gun metal brushes from morphe they look
like this they have a white hair tip and
they have like this cool rose metal it's
really really cute I like the packaging
this is the ar-10 and this is the r7
this I have been using for contouring
all month long it's such a good you see
how like just look as brush see how does
that tapering and it just like fluffs
out and it really flows the fluff out of
all this like it's just such a good
contouring brush I've been using it all
month long really does help give me a
nice sharp line but still making it very
blendable and because the bristles are
so extremely soft and I've been using
the r7 to bronze up my skin that's why I
look so Brown as you can see both of
look Brown I just been kind of touching
my temples with this bronzing up my
cheeks they're inexpensive and they work
well honestly I don't know what else to
say about them besides they're thick as
 and they're inexpensive and I have
a code with them you can save money it's
just you guys know how I go about market
I think they're such a great brand and
they just open up a new store up in
Burbank they have a new store it's
humongous it's like five six times
bigger than the original store and it's
just really cool cuz you can go into the
store see their brushes it's like a
magical land when you go there it's
insane if you guys can go to the morphe
store and see the brushes in person feel
them see how they feel like you can
literally see how long they are and you
can use my code in store too I want to
use code man anyway just save me some
money in the store so it's cool I just
think got your double check them out I
think they're fantastic maybe one day
like more if you would be like hey wanna
have a mean jury here I don't know
that'd be kind of cool I think because I
work so closely with them already like
I'm already such like I'm like their
biggest fan
hmm one day we're doing again our 10 or
our 7 check them out they're absolutely
fantastic blend beautifully and there's
nothing more to say about them they're
sick the blush I have been loving this
past month has been the Marc Jacobs air
blush in the shade kink and kisses which
is the shade right here
it's what I'm wearing on my cheeks right
now as my blush this I don't know what
it is about this formula guys this
formula has been giving me life giving
me like bitch has me shook it is so
beautiful it's so lightweight feels like
actual it feels like butter fully feels
like butter the shade right here
I hope you guys can see it it's kind of
hard to pick up on the swatch but on the
face like it works so nicely
what's cool about it too is I has its
dark pink moments as its light pink
moment so you can really mix it together
to be like hey I want more pink this day
add more pink if you want it to be a
little bit more neutral add more of the
neutral light pink in such a nice
beautiful blush it goes on literally
flawlessly it's so when they say an air
blush it really is like an airbrush
finish and I have nothing bad to say
about this at all other than the fact I
think it's extremely expensive but
honestly it's so good so it's almost
like one of those things like I hate
spending a lot of money on things but
when it's amazing like and it's actually
good quality
I don't mind it mind you I didn't I
didn't pay for this and this was said to
me in PR but I'm saying like when I do
buy things and they're expensive but I
know if I know it's going to work then I
mind spending the money on it because
it's a more of an investment for me so I
just been loving this blush in the shade
again King and kisses love the name
kinking kisses my number woman yeah yeah
so I'm down to my last item I have like
one after this but it doesn't really
count but this is my last last item this
is the Oprah Beverly Hills highlighting
wheel this wheel has been changing it up
for me for real it's what I have on my
eyes it's what I have on my cheeks it's
what I have on my like temples
everywhere that highlighted is the over
wheel like I cannot get over this
 wheel it's so good it's such an
intensely pigmented freaking crazy
highlighter like I love it so let me
just show you I'm gonna mix all shades
are here like gnarly and then I'm gonna
swatch here child are you
kidding this little palette is
so hyper painted and you get five shades
in one so basically if you want like
more of a bright intense highlighter one
day you can mix the white in with
something if you want more of a peachy
subdued Gray's one you can mix the
purple one with the pink like there's a
lot of combinations you can do this
which I really like I also love to just
mix the whole thing together and put it
on my face and just it this is what it
looks like this is what I have on my
face now but the only thing I will say
about this I do not like is the fact
that it's extremely powdery I don't like
products that are very very very powdery
it just drives me crazy it's a personal
preference thing like when I go in with
a brush like so much powder comes up but
honestly the effect is so cool and it's
so there and it's absolutely beautiful
that I've really I don't really care I'm
going to forfeit it for the cool effect
and I just think that it's so good if
you guys can if you guys have checked it
out I don't know if you guys have or not
but the Oprah Beverly Hills highlighting
wheel is so amazing it's freaking
amazing I've been using it for like two
months now I just haven't put it in a
favorites video yet I don't know why
it's so good check it out and last but
not least I really want to talk about
this just really quickly just bring it
up because it's coming to an end
so my powered makeup geek my baby
you guys knew this house was gonna come
my limited-edition Magnum you a palette
with makeup geek is almost sold out it's
almost done like we it's almost done I'm
just I don't know I'm just devastated
because it's absolutely amazing this is
my palette let show you guys I'm talking
about a recently on snapchat and so many
people bought it like recently cuz I
don't even know I did have a power I
would make a geek this is what it looks
like um honestly I have no word this is
my the epitome of my favorite palette
this is everything I want in something
and I'm just so bummed because like it's
coming to an end and we're almost
completely sold out it mean gradually
it's a bought every single month every
single day we ordered so so many units
but now it's dwindling there's literally
maybe like five to ten thousand left and
we think about it like oh that's a lot
like five to ten thousand that's a lot
but when I have collectively maybe five
million followers almost yeah he's not
that much if you know what I mean so
just let you guys know if you guys
aren't interested in getting the palette
I would definitely eat it while you guys
can because it will be gone very very
very very soon and really bad but it's
been an amazing run and I'm so happy
with the palette and I'm so happy that
people have been loving the palette
ever since I launched so check it out of
course I'll leave a link down below and
that's that and that is it for today's
video I hope you guys enjoyed it I have
so much fun creating favorites videos

just think that there's so much fun and
it's so fun to see you guys suggestions
and my comments and tell you guys know
what I have been loving and you guys are
so receptive with these videos and you
guys seem to really like them and that
makes me happy because I'm not gonna
suggest something that I don't love and
don't like actually believe in and I
want you to always remember that I'm not
gonna freakin try to sell you something
just because I'm gonna feel leave it
with this brand or like a potential like
sponsorship or something like that I'm
gonna let you guys know what is up and
