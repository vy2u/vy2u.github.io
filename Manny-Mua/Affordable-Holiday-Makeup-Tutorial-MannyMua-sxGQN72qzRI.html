yeah okay guys what is up let's go and
start this affordable makeup look with
some primer so I went out and bought the
Nivea
and sensitive post shave balm from like
CVS I don't remember I got it exactly
but this has been such a like popular
like item as of recently because in
nikkietutorials started talking about
this as a primary because it has a
glycerin as one of the main ingredients
she said it's a really bomb it has
primary so I'm like you know what
I trust Nikki's opinion it smells like a
dude a hundred percent feels like a guy
it feels really really really nice and
like very lightweight talking feel my
face trying to get like Mila tacky so
the foundation time I take the Loreal
Pro matte infallible foundation by
lowering I'll just focus on huh I'm
obsessed with this foundation actually
just got this is a new one because I
completely ran out of my old one this is
in the shade 103 natural buff taking a
Real Techniques Beauty Blender sponge
I'm just gonna go and stipple that onto
the face starting in the t-zone first I
love this foundation you guys I'm not
kidding like this is one of the
prettiest foundations from the drugstore
I've ever ever had the pleasure of
trying it is so good sure you guys can
tell it's not my color yeah I like to go
low dark with uneven if you guys are
early if you guys need more full
coverage like this is seriously the
foundation to go with it is so cheap
it's like eight bucks you can always get
like little deals on it to like it is
seriously so bomb now for concealer I
just went out and bought two this
recently it is the Maybelline better
skin concealer it looks like this it's
like a little blue cap I've never tried
this so far this is literally the first
time trying it I'm really stoked to try
this out door like I've heard pretty
good things and I grabbed it in the
shade I think what are ya well shade are
yeah like I'm assuming cuz it doesn't
say oh it's going to get down pretty far
I'm gonna highlight with this blend that
out with the V blender it's nice oh my
gosh it's nice as blending how nicely
give me an intense highlight which I
wanted I'm impressed I am a freak
impressed I'm always so impressed with
Maybelline honestly I just like I just
love Maybelline I'm sorry I love them
I freaking love them so I'm going to set
to the other eye really quickly I'm
using the Maybelline 110 Pitney this is
a really nice under eye setting powder I
used it in my drugstore video and I
loved it
so let's go ahead and set the under-eye
how do I always get Creasy underneath my
eye and I always need to set it to be
honest though I think I like the other
Maybelline concealer more they're really
intense like heavy duty one that looks
like more like shellac II think I like
that one a little bit better but this is
this applicator is really really nice
that's going to highlight as well and
this little can see that wants to set
real quick give you a work quick with it
so now I'm ready one set the face
because I have the concealer on it looks
pretty good I'm going to take the
Maybelline
me matte and poreless in the shade 130
on my more feet g0 brush of coals might
even brush not shown set the face this
is a really really good powder guys
honestly like it reminds me so much of
Mac Studio Fix powder but like the
drugstore version I don't know if that
makes sense and this powder I'm gonna
take down my neck because I need a star
match in my face so my neck I just don't
like to be this pale as my neck is so I
like to go darker and like pretend them
like not this pale but you know I am LM
LM I am what I am
so now I'm going to highlight and
contour so I just opened up this package
from morphe today and I'm so stoked it
is the 9 C palette which is like the 9
contoured look at how sickening this
looks like I'm so excited try this the
colors I'm not kidding you like when I
swatch this middle banana shade
butter it feels like butter so I'm so so
to try this out so I'm gonna take my
morphe and for 3 a of course and I'm
gonna take the under eye regular just
powdering here try highlighting a V
under eye area with this yellow eat
powder yes like yes this is like
slimy look Oh highlight oh my gosh look
oh hi lady that is God Morpheus so
there's like me right now but don't you
guys feel like morphe has like really
been stepping up into their cuz I
feel like they have honestly I feel like
they have been really stepping it up and
it makes me so freakin happy because
everything from morphe is so
cost-efficient and I'm like dude that's
like so amazing for the freaking the
average consumer who doesn't want to
spend freaking $50 on a contour kit like
what I'm gonna take this on this
side right here with more feet and 5 to
7 and my bronze up the skin with this
it's a nice like terra cotta a warm
shade so let's see how that works out
for bronzer woo yes I just kind of like
to run the brush in like circular
motions just kind of like same shade on
the temples as well Oh
what do you think of the skin so far
thing looks pretty frickin bum
so now the blush of the skin really
quickly I want to jump around I want to
go around arm around I'm gonna take my
morphe 3 anymore feet 9b palette this is
their blush palette another really
popular like trendy thing right now I'm
gonna take the shade right here it's
like a nice guy that's really I think
watch out cuz it is like pigmented
as hell like pigmented
okay primer so now we are all blushed up
I really like how the blush looks I
think the freaking the morphe stuff is
just so freakin pigmented it's
disgustingly bomb like I don't even know
I wasn't prepared for the amount of
blush it but I'm like nervous blushy now
let's going to highlight my favorite
step I'm gonna take the color pop super
shock cheek in electric slide which is
like a golden reflecting highlighter you
guys know how I'm all about a golden
highlight like I'm obsessed with golden
highlights so um yes ma'am he has gone
look at that highlight I believe this is
part of their holiday collection that's
coming out soon I know the color pops
like they're highlighters are like eight
like eight bucks or somebody's out like
ten or eight bucks super affordable
super nice like look how intensity
reflecting this is like I am loving this
highlight right now oh my god taking
this with me to my travel I need a bait
I need a base highlighter and that is so
it that is so it okay great so basically
the face is completely done I like how
turned out I think it looks pretty
freakin good for especially for products
I have not even tried I'm like I'm
gonna be so screwed I'm gonna be so out
of luck I don't know what the Frick I'm
doing so I've never even tried to call
it pop highlighter this is the first
time I tried it and I love it I think it
looks so sick same with the morphe
contour kit the primer everything I did
I feel like this is like not only is it
a affordable tutorial but it's also like
a first impressions I'm like so how am I
gonna like this is it gonna work
for you or no off camera I went and put
do my brows I did I used the L'Oreal
Paris
brow stylist plumper and I just kind of
combed it through my brows I've been
really into more natural brows recently
so I did that and I primed my lids with
the Maybelline concealer as my primer so
I think that'll work pretty really
nicely I have a pretty good idea of like
what I want to do for the eyes I'm just
not like super sure I just have an idea
of what I want and I know I want to use
the morphe 35 K palette it is a stew
stop
like look how gorgeous this is it
reminds me a 35 oh but it's a little
more cool tone so it's like half cool
tone half warm tone so if you guys are
into more neutral colors this is the
palette for you 35k gag-worthy and I
just got today so I want to use it this
isn't an easy I look I promise using to
be such an easy chill relax look I'm
gonna take this shade right here which
is like a very kind of burnt dusty
orange II on a more 50:27 that's gonna
go into the crease and just kind of whoa
pigmented okay it's gonna mix it now
let's see if it means it I mix it with
this shade right here which is another
like kind of vanilla you shade I'm gonna
mix those two close together because
that is too pigmented it's gonna be like
to enhance room you know that's not what
I'm going for so it makes that I've been
to the crease like the burnt orange ooh
shade makes it really like festive like
I want this look to be festive in
Thanksgiving or just you know just just
festive in general like just holiday-ish
and I just like the way the orange looks
everything looks so pretty orange on the
eyes like I love orange on the eyes I
love it or I'm going to take this shade
right here and that's going to go into
the outer corner of the crease on a
morphine 36 pencil brush and this is
really what's inside giving me some
warmth and chuckle lot shades up in here
and four for one again and blend that
out too cool so now we have the eye part
done it's like a nice outer corner
intense like brownish on the outer
corner very simple I'm going to take the
shade over here the one that we had
originally it's like the second shade
here on my finger I'm just gonna run
that on the lid it's gotta give me some
more brightness on the lid again and
then on a more feet M 3 to 6 I really
small just precise brush I'm going to
take this white shade over here that's
gonna go on the inner corner of my eye
I'm just gonna bring some like light and
brightness to the eye it's a very like
frosty white like you see that's right
oh my goodness
mmm and be like so good okay so the main
part of the eyes I wanted to do like an
intense bold a swing like that was like
kind of badass and sickening so I wanna
take the morphe gel liner in Slate which
is a very cheap very black good Jo liner
it's only like 8 bucks and it's like
bomb as hell on a sigma small oh ye o 6
yeah I'm still in your wing girl feeling
the lean okay perfect so I went ahead
and I filled in the liner on both sides
I really want to do an intense like bold
wing as like the main thing off the eye
you know you feel me so let's go ahead
girl it's almost gone I'm gonna go and
put the L'Oreal telescopic carbon black
mascara on my eyes honest a minute where
falsies anyway always wear falsies so
this just to kinda and make my lashes
look more black to blend them into my
ballsy's more what did you guys's
favorite drugstore mascara I'm really
curious because honestly like I feel
like I'm on the hunt for a cool mascara
from the drugstore not trying to buy
seventeen you know there's so many
drugstore mascaras like it's
overwhelming so I'm like I need help let
me know let a bitch know where your
guys's favorite drugstore mascara is and
I'll go out and buy it on the bottom -
I'm actually gonna keep the bottom of
the eye completely blank I'm not gonna
do like anything to it
I just want to do some mascara and
that's about it this mascara is good for
the bottom if you like get off all the
excess off the brush because it's so
easy to like get it all over your skin
this one's kind of like that yeah just
go and wait till it dries and then you
can just kind of wipe it away with a
little a q-tip or something and you'll
be good to go but I'm gonna go ahead and
put some falsies on now pause these are
the one thing I'm gonna like kind of
splurge on these are the Bella lashes by
new bottom they are my favorite lashes
ever and I just think they will look
really good with this eye look and I
just if you guys want you guys should
definitely use like a more affordable
lash for sure like these are mink lashes
so they're a little bit less affordable
but I don't have time to go out and buy
um what's that like really affordable
lash brand that's really popular at the
drugstore something whispies demi
whispies what's what brand has demi
whispies um ordell yeah okay so I didn't
have any time to go buy like any art
doll lashes or anything so I was gonna
toss on some I knew about some Bella's
instead because that is a very it's a
constant for me it's a constant love and
all they want is constant love perfect
now apply the other lash these lashes
are Li not amazing mm okay great so
lashes are on now let me go into me guys
in to see what they look like up close
we'll go
through wastelands through the highways
my shadow through the Sun perfect so
that we have the face and the eyes
completely done I'm gonna go and we want
the lips and be done with the entire
thing I'm gonna go ahead and do
I'm news NYX lip liner in the color
mauve which is a berry just Bob moppy
color I don't know such a pretty lip
