so second aid oh I'm super super super
super excited to be making this video
because it's about being you on some
really hills cream contour palette I
have all three and I love them so
basically I'm going to be doing a review
and demo of how I use the cream contour
palette I've already used them a couple
times and so now I feel like I have a
good like feel of them and I can
describe them much better now than I
could like when I first are using
because I first saw just like what
madness like I didn't know what I was
really doing I now know more than what I
was doing in path for the first time so
if you guys are interested in the demo
on how I use these and a reviewing on
what I think of the product please feel
free to click ahead if you want just the
review part and if not then just keep
watching and you guys don't like it
don't Marcin don't that's fine I
don't care
I don't we have without further ado I'll
get you guys to the demo review other
because all so much I'll see you soon
okay cool so the further review part
this is working the start to run field
so this is what they look like it comes
in this cute little packaging just what
it looks like and then you slip the
little bit out and out comes the contour
colors so this is a cream contour
palette comes with six cream contour
colors okay this is the medium whether
it is a light a medium and a dark each
pan has 4.5 grams of product which is
absolutely amazing for like the price I
had to pay for it so it's $40 total I
think the powder contour palette is 40
as well so this one this 40 wanna see
out probably like I like this one more
than I like the powder contour honestly
I just I love this little cream palette
after the first time I use this I was
kind of confused because I was like the
cream was very very dense and it wasn't
blending as well as I wanted to blend it
I was like oh my god I don't know I
don't know what I'm doing I'm not to use
a cream contour like I'm just I sucked
like I had no idea what I was doing with
the product so I was realizing that this
is a cream contour palette it's not a
concealer palette okay it's full pigment
200 segments but it's not meant to blend
out like a concealer will so a lot
people might be confused on that let me
explain when you put a color down you
want the color to stay when it comes to
cream contouring so for example I have
like I have like winter
or in this area right here and you can
see that it's a lot more harsh towards
the base of my contour which is what
contour is meant to be you know you want
your contour to be a little more dense
right here than it is everywhere else
you don't want it to be completely
diffused out because then you're losing
the integrity of the color okay so ask
infuse with that person when I was
running away and I was thinking this
thing is like it's not blending as well
as I want it to bend but it's really
it's not meant to it's not meant to
blend that easily okay you want to be
able to blend but you don't want to
blend into nothing like concealers do
concealers are meant to blend into your
skin perfectly this isn't meant to blend
your skin perfectly it's meant to stay
so for those of you who might have more
dry skin that don't want to deal with
blending what I end up doing if I wanted
more more more pigment with a little bit
more creaminess a little bit more blend
ability I added maracuja oil from Tarte
a drop of it to the product and I kind
of mixed it and I applied it and implied
so creamy so beautifully and give me
more of a satin finish which is gonna
make great reveal that more that are
more on the dry side so if you get if
you get the product and you notice it's
a little bit more on the drawing side
and you can't blend it out as well as
you want to add a drop of miracle oil
and it is so so easy or any kind of
beauty oil honestly any beauty will be
great but the maracuja
the Tarte one is I think is absolutely
amazing I love that it doesn't blend out
so easily that's that's like the point
dude like that is the point of a clean
contour palette this isn't a cream
concealer palette this is a cream
contour palette and I like using this as
a base before my foundation if you're
more into an intense highlighting
contour you want to do on top your
foundation if you're more into the more
natural look like really priority do it
underneath your foundation okay it's
gonna be sold inside makes these simple
stores and the office has a website just
a disclaimer I wasn't paid to talk about
this product anything that I was sent
the product and I'm just talking about
it because I know people want to know
about it because it comes out to day
what is the date I'm talking like I'm in
the future I hate when I do I lay my
hand these come out February 17th which
is today I think this product is well
well well worth it so yeah I think that
these products are absolutely amazing
and I would definitely definitely
doesn't go out and get them for sure
like fresh refresher if Baroni okay cool
so we're gonna go ahead and start we're
gonna start with no makeup on I tend to
I have it
have like a video where I had no makeup
on in like Ohio so it's been a minute
like I have literally nothing on they
gonna primary don't have no BB cream and
got I got on this to be
different okay so what we're gonna go
ahead and do first we're gonna go and
start with them Prime we're gonna prime
our whole face I'm going to use the
benefit Porefessional I like using this
primary myself because I am more on the
oily to combo sign so I'm gonna go and
use this and I'm gonna focus in mostly
in the center and blend it out with my
fingertips because I'm usually more oily
and I my pores are more gigantic in the
center so I get for having that acne
when I was in high school huh okay so
we're nice and tight so what we're gonna
do next is we're going to go ahead and
use a little bit of a concealer a very
tiny tiny tiny baby amount and we're
just going to conceal the under-eye area
only we're not gonna do like anything
else not gonna highlight with this we're
just gonna conceal the under-eye area so
I'm taking my Mac Pro Longwear and nw20
not using a lot of product only a little
bit I just want to really cover the dark
circles like that and then set right
away with the translucent powder a very
light amount of trailers in Allah as
crucial it's nice and set and it's just
like just concealed we're just
considering a little bag you so all we
do is we go and highlight with the cream
contour kit what the what the whole
video is about I'm using the medium
contour kit and I'm going to be using a
more PG 2 for my highlight which is like
this nice tapered buffing brush which I
really really really really love so when
you're going to this palette what I will
say is that the creams are pretty stiff
and so if you're more of a beginner
because this is going to be more of a
beginner like type thing or we're doing
with this what I discovered is we're
going to add a drop of maracuja oil by
Tarte on any kind of you oil will work
but I'm just going to use American one
because I love this one and I'm
literally just going to add a small drop
so you can see over here there's a job
that's fallen there so now it's
extremely creamy extremely pigmented
still and you're not losing the
integrity of the formula okay so now I'm
going to go on with the brush we're
going to literally dip in our we're
going to put it in the under eye area
see how people do this is pigmented
pigment is on point it's all we're gonna
do is we really concentrate the color
right here and we're going to bring it
out the reason I like to take it out is
because
we just like 101 contouring highlighting
if you have a more full face that's more
full on the outside you're gonna want to
concentrate your highlight towards the
center to give you more like dainty
small face you know I'm saying me I have
a long face I like to bring highlight to
the center and outwards to give me more
of it pulled back look because my face
is so long I don't have full cheeks um
if you want I can always make a video on
how to do contouring for different face
shapes let me know in the comment below
cuz I can't will you do something like
that but this is just for my face is
what I like to do okay if we have that
color down let's go on doing the center
of the for it as well we're gonna do
inside of the chin a little bit with
little and then I'll take a smaller
brush this is the Sigma shader lid brush
the e 56 and I'll take it down my nose I
want to cool so now that we are
highlighted Mama's highlighted is
heyo so we're gonna go and do it we're
gonna grab more feet g3 this I feel is
very crucial for cream contouring get
the flat kabuki brush essentially like
it's a flat little brush perfect for
them and then we're gonna go ahead and
grab the color nude right here we're
going to dip right into it we're going
to start and I'm going to press it in
this color is a lot more warm than the
comforter color I'm going to go in with
so what I like about this is it's going
to give me more of a glow to the skin
this will add a transition for me for my
contour so I'm gonna take it around the
forehead as well and I like to slim down
my forehead because I'm a man and I'm a
man forehead so I wanted like slim the
 down by the hairline so I have like
this nice more warm base okay so you
guys can see that it's nice and warm
it's creamy it's based the basinet
scream so I also want to do the nose
with that same color so I'm gonna grab
the same color with a sigma e 58 cream
color brush just for me I like to take
down the notes because I have a
big ass man nose so I think you mm-hmm
there we go like that so my nose is
contour just looking a little bit more
skin T we're gonna grab a morphe g9
which is a flat like a very flat pointed
brush okay any flat pointed brush will
work I'm describing the morphe one cuz I
really love the gunmetal series and I
also have a code with morphe so manyy
MUA to get 10% off all morphe brushes
which are amazing you guys know if you
guys follow me on my youtube you know
that I love them I love them so much
we're gonna go in with that g9 we're
gonna go into the darkest color yes
thing its darkest but it's fine
we're gonna blend it out anyway we're
only gonna go on to the tip of the brush
and we're gonna do is we really start to
carve out what we want to carve out
we're gonna do is we're just kind of
softly at shall a line like that then
we're do same thing on the forehead
we're gonna do a little bit when do a
right by the hairline okay so now we're
gonna do is go ahead and grab the same
g3 brush our literally just gonna press
and buff out that darker cream contour
into the other one luckily these cream
contours from Anasazi they blend out so
so well buff upwards so now we have the
actual contra color blended out more
we're gonna grab a damp Beauty Blender
and we're literally gonna press over
everything it just gonna help buff a
little bit more there's not as many hard
lines yes we're getting somewhere
we're getting somewhere Co see where
it's going we're going we're getting
somewhere now we're going to go ahead
and grab our foundation of choice I'm
grabbing the arm
luminous silk and I'm gonna grab a pump
of it on the back of my hand and what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna dab use my
finger and just dab a couple little dots
everywhere on my face and we're going to
use that Beauty Blender and we're going
to blend out our foundation on top and
after all that blending and pressing you
should get something like this so what
you have is you have a nice highlighted
area right here and you have a nice soft
diffused shadowy area right here so
we're gonna do now is I'm just gonna set
everything I just personally like
setting everything you don't have to but
I'm just going to do it because I'm more
boilie combo so I'm going to do is I'm
going to grab the Kat Von D shade light
palette which is their highlight contour
palette which I love and I'm gonna grab
their little brush that came with and
then I'm gonna grab the vanilla a
powdery one and then I'm just going to
set the entire thing every part that I
highlighted with I'm gonna set with the
banana shade and then every part that I
did more of the bronzy contour I'm gonna
do the middle shade here with the same
brush on the other side we're going to
do is run a grab for this one here we're
just gonna lightly go on top of it very
very very lightly because I don't want
it to be too intense the great thing
about having a cream contour down first
is that soon as you put a powder on top
of it it's going to really bring out
that color and it's going to stay on a
lot longer throughout the day so it
should look something like this this
looks a little bit intense because I
don't have any other makeup on if I go
to the cat fur or something mind you we
don't have any other makeup on so if
what I wanted to my lips what's up a
blush on with a highlighter on it's all
gonna come together really nicely I'm
gonna finish my makeup and then I'll
come right back and this is what the
final look looks like with everything on
I have like some lashes on I have some
lipstick on highlighter blush all that
shenanigans okay so it does come
together when you have everything done I
think that it looks really really really
pretty really natural more of a natural
glowy type look rather than so like
harshly contoured unless absolutely
going for which is great as well but I
was going for more of like the natural
like everyday woman like she can wear
this you know if I am I'm yeah so that
