it has been so long since I have
filmed a video I just got back from
three weeks of out of town I've been in
LA
Vegas New York twice it just been such
an intense past couple weeks and I
really want to just to jump in and film
I whenever I get back from a trip I had
to film like right away because I just
like I kind of forget the with swing of
things so I just filmed I still have
videos like I pre filmed the how many be
putting up for you guys very soon but
this is like me coming back right into
it from my trip and I hope you guys like
this video just been crazy this past
three weeks have been insane I did the
mean green New York with benefit I'm on
the benefit gondola with cheekathon with
Patrick and Kathleen and it was just
such an amazing experience I got to the
meeting gree with Patrick in New York
which was so amazing and I got to hang
out with Jeffrey like this entire like
three weeks I did with Jeffery star
we've been hanging out at his house and
we filmed then it was just so much fun
and it's been such an awesome three
weeks that I almost didn't want to come
home but I did so badly because I've
been so homesick and I'd missed you guys
and I miss filming and I miss being in
front of the camera that is what I want
to do today I want to film this look on
my eyes I literally just got this like
Jeffrey gave it to me before I came back
to San Diego the new beauty killer
palette and I really wanted to use this
in a video because it just so freakin
cool and this is the look I came up with
this was a very pretty like Barbie blue
pink like nude lip kind of look and I
think it turned out sexual I
still have my Urban Decay one brand
tutorial I filmed a nice like summer
skin video that I have coming up as well
so I'll be putting those two up very
very soon let me know in the comments
below if you guys want to see a natural
summer look or a turbine decay one brand
tutorial first and that's what the video
will put up but I just wanted to do this
one really quickly because it has been
so freaking long since I films and I'm
like I'm filming today and I
don't care I'm sorry if you guys can
hear any button-down music from the
next-door neighbors they just
decided to have a party like
right now and they're playing music so
loudly I wanted to go over and
pass them to turn it down my parents
were like no don't do that be sweet be
nice like don't do that oh if I can
be it don't cause a scene and I'm like
but my job is home they're playing some
like mariachi so just letting you
guys know we're just have to kind of
roll with the punches at this point yeah
like I'm rambling so much because it's
been so long but yeah I hope you guys
like this video as always if you guys
don't like this video if you guys don't
like me please
don't and watching all the joke
with that but you guys do you guys do
like me please like this video and
subscribe to my channel if you want
already and if you're new what's up and
mani MUA and welcome to my channel thank
you guys for being here
so yeah that's going into this full face
look
so it's gonna get started on this video
I'm gonna be doing the full face today
because I have been literally got
knocked on then three weeks so I really
want to start getting into it just jump
right in and film with anything because
I know a lot of you guys do tell me that
you guys like to see more full face
videos rather than just like me do my
eyes or like one particular thing so I'm
just listening to you guys more and
doing what you guys ask me I am your
 slave
first things first I'm gonna private
with V makeup ever step one um what they
set one skin equalizer Basin smoothing
literally you can see that I've had some
lovin pat it on my nose
and on the center of my face and it
really does conceal the appearance of my
pores and when I'm wearing makeup all
day it just like looks nice it looks
really really really nice and it helps
control my oil a little bit as well
because it is a smoothing silicone you
primer great so for the center of the
face I'm gonna going with the Loreal Pro
matte and fallible you guys knows is
like one of my favorite foundations
honestly it's just such a good
foundation and yes from a drugstore and
it took eight bucks I'm going to put
that on the t-zone with the Beeb under
awesome Pro matte infallible is in the
center and then for the rest of the face
I'm gonna go in with the Dior air flash
foundation my favorite foundation of all
time this is literally number one
foundation for me you really can't go
wrong I swear it - such a beautiful
foundation I'm gonna use the shade 300
for my face it is not my shade I do know
that I does a little bit darker but no
 given I'm just gonna pounce that
in with a Buell inner usually I'll take
this foundation on a like flat top
kabuki brush or something like that but
I've just been using it with a Beauty
Blender recently and I've noticed that
my skin has been looking so be
like so nice with a Beauty Blender what
I'm using it just I don't know I feel
like I'm really working the foundation
into my skin like really just pressing
it in working it in and I've noticed
that it really does make a difference
when I'm using it with a blender rather
than a flat top kabuki but I mean either
way both work great possum so for
concealer I'm going to be going in with
two colors from the naked weightless
concealer line from Urban Decay
I'm gonna be taking these shades light
neutral and the shades fair neutral and
I just literally just love these
concealers so much tonight's just
beautiful like full coverage consistency
it's like lightweight too it's just like
the weirdest thing I don't know how to
explain the consistency of this you can
see there but it's just so nice so first
I go on with the darker one closest to
my eyes because it has more of a pink
undertone so I'm gonna take the lighter
one and put
lower than the other concealer and his
going start blending out with a beauty
blender the one that we already used
before so have you guys been I feel like
I've been gone for so long which
I really have been I've been gone for
three weeks
literally 21 days I've been gone that's
so long I'm filled in 21 days why
definitely have I filmed with Jeffrey
for his rolls-royce video which was so
fun to do he's gonna be doing a new
series on his channel called like
rolls-royce get ready and I think it's a
freaking genius idea so that was really
really fun but I haven't filmed like at
home or from my own channel in literally
like three weeks the funny thing too is
I still have like two videos I have pre
filmed that I haven't even put up yet so
I'm gonna be putting those up very very
soon I just like to really film when I
get right back home because I feel like
I forgot how to film so I need to get
into it you know so I'm going to take
the laura mercier translucent setting
powder and this be 48 brush and just set
the under eye and for the rest of this
I'm going to take the ultra definition
loose powder by urban decay on a big
ichi morphe brush and just set that all
over the damn face just to set
everything makes where nothing is going
to be moving around I just think it's
absolutely beautiful it gives you like a
HD finish and when you're filming for
YouTube honey
it sees what mama wants okay and I'd
like to concentrate on the edges of my
face and then like kind of bring it in
because this is a shade that's a little
bit darker than me already went in with
a darker foundation I need to go the
darker powder too I don't think I do do
not neglect the neck because you already
know just don't do it I really don't
like to take liquids dominant right
often liquid foundation I like to just
take powders down my neck to match
everything because if you like it's so
much faster and easier and I don't know
liquids are just so weird on the neck
like it I'll do it sometimes but not too
often let's go ahead and highlight the
under eyes really quickly with the Marc
Jacobs instant Marc powders my favorite
under-eye powder it's absolutely
stunning with the same be 48 brush you
guys this powder it works so so good
like me sideways with a chain saw
good you know it's not too too yellow I
know it looks yellow on the pan but it
doesn't come off like yellow you know
what I mean so if you ever want a nice
powder for the under eyes I know I
talked about it in a favorites video
before try the insta mark now for the
rest of the face I'm so excited to use
this product hey chica the so benefit
recently released this palette called
cheekathon and if you guys didn't know
or follow me on Jill show me
I am actually on the gondola inside
Sephora with Patrick and Kathleen we're
living like the models of this product
on the benefit Kandra it's just so cool
they're just means so much to me that
benefit like took the chance on me and
Patrick and Kathleen and allowed us to
be inside Sephora with them and it's
just such a cool experience like not
many like Beauty vloggers could say that
they're inside Sephora you know what I
mean so thank you so much the benefit
you guys are seriously amazing
this is bomb the fact you guys
did this I can mean five full-size box
of powders dandelion hula rocket or
Dallas Corley's that you get a little
brush a little brushy it's literally
worth $145 but it's only 58 bucks inside
store so it's just such a cool amazing
like high value and of course I'll be
linking this down below as is every
other product I used look at it it's so
pretty and even on the Support website
you'll see me and Patrick and Kathleen
on the site with Judith on so it's just
so cool and I'm so excited to be using
this this launch is like Sephora wet
while I've been gone so I've got a film
with it or anything so this is like my
first time filming with it and I just
think it's absolutely freaking sick I'm
gonna take the e to brush and hoola push
you're gonna dip right into hoola and
start broadening up the skin you guys
know hoola and I whoo and I go away
him pack Hula's just meant for everyone
really at this point I'm just gonna run
that all over the place because it is a
bronzer now they're all bronzed up with
hoola I just feel like I look so bronzy
I just love hula hula such a good
bronzer you guys know I love it and I'm
gonna take the rocket or shade over here
I just like a nice satin really pretty
blush I'm gonna run that on the cheeks
with my morphe 3 brush hopefully guys
can't hear anything because the
neighbors are playing such loud ass
music it's like sold out hope you guys
can hear I just closed my window
hopefully that'll work a little better
apologize you guys in here in the
background but I really can't do much
about it so we have the face on I'm
going to highlight a little bit to again
forget the head have you guys used this
tell me you guys have the sleek Solstice
palette it is one of the most intensely
highlighting bright highlighting palette
I've ever used ever jaqen was the first
one I think to talk about this on her
snapchat and she said was like one of
the most beaming highlights she's ever
ever tried and I'm sure tons of people
went out and bought it right after her
and I was one of them I literally saw
that and I was like oh um I need it I'm
taking this little shade right here this
is a highlight that's like really really
bright and really intense so if you're
the average person that
doesn't like a bright and intense
highlight where you can literally
 cause accidents I am though so I
think Jacqueline really started a trend
here with this brightest highlight and
let's all think her right now think
Jacqueline Hill for this highlight
cuz I don't think I've ever had a
highlighter this bright in my entire
life so good and I think we're done with
the face it's a little onto the eyes now
okay so I went and I did my brows off of
camera if you guys wanna see me do I
updated a brow routine let me know in
the comments bar below and I'll
definitely get that done for you guys
but I've been liking this more full
heavy brow I'm so excited using this to
F like today's like an exciting video
because I'm using like things I haven't
even tried yet this is the new Jeffrey
star Beauty killer palette and I have it
today to try out for you guys that's the
packaging come on now oh okay cool just
slay my whole existence why
don't you I'm gonna take my morphe 27
and a very very very light layer of
Courtney which is a nice just like
pretty neutral Brown crease shade and
that's going to go into the crease very
very lightly this is in your transition
shade I'm not gonna put a lot of it at
all though it's a nice distant matte
shade because I don't want it to be too
intense but I do want to have something
that pink will blend into because I'm an
idea of what I want to do today and it
involves the pink so we should take a
little bit of this color there we go
very very just soft nice easy transition
and then I'm gonna go in with a morphe
m43 three and I'm gonna take this shade
starpower which is like the bright ass
pink shade that's going to go into the
crease I feel like I want to do like a
nice pink crease white lid blue under I
just very very barbie kind of look and I
know a lot people probably looking at
this palette thinking like oh my god
those shades are really really bold but
why not use those shades
that people are gonna be like steering
away from in today's video so I'm gonna
go ahead and put star power into the
crease it's a nice just hot pink look at
that pigment though Wow
okay it's the first time I'm using it to
guys like this is like we're using this
together taking it all the way in to the
inner corner and now I have this isidris
really hot pink crease I don't know I
just think it looks so cool I just blend
it out a little bit with e27 again this
pink is like Marvin neon bright pink
beige everyone to make sure the edges
are
so I'm gonna take the shade at vanity on
a more feet 18 and you start packing on
the outer corner just to give me a
little bit of definition it's like a
purple color very very small amount of
it because I don't want it to be a main
focus of this look just a little bit on
the outer corner it's a nice like deep
plum is gray almost with the pink I'm
going to blend that out something like
this now it's a nice dark outer corner
amazing so now we have a darkness on the
outer corner it's looking like this very
nice and just edgy and having some more
dimension I'm gonna be taking favorite
brush at the moment the morphe M 210 I
talked about this already in my last
favorites video such a good packing
brush and I'm gonna take the shade China
white which could actually be like my
favorite shade in this entire palette
it's so so so nice it's like a nice just
creamy white color so pigmented I love
this Shane so mud and 4-3-3 just blend
out those edges a little bit I thought
this look is very like Barbie glam so I
want to do eyeliner I'm gonna do black
eyeliner I would take the Kat Von D
tattoo trooper liner and I'm just gonna
do a wing just fill that bad boy in
great so we have the eye liner on it now
and as you can see just adds a really
cool extra cat-like definition it makes
it much more wearable too like the pink
and the crease I know it's kind of scary
to some people but it makes it much more
wearable when you do a nice eyeliner
look like this so I wanted to add a nice
bold freakin eyeliner just a cut
about though they try you it's not like
that so now I'm going to be taking a
morphic you 36 and the shade expensive
and that's gonna go on the bottom
lashline if it's a blue shade with a
nice like satin finish that's like a
little small like sparkles of like
silver so take that on the bottom lash
line and really Barbie this bitch oh you
know oh my god I feel like a little aqua
princess I really don't I want to shade
Courtney just to blend out the blue
it'll just help with the appearance of a
Belen so it doesn't look so stark and
harsh you know what I mean I found this
eyeliner on my colour-pop that looks so
cute like a periwinkle color in the
shade pranced and I think this is one I
do in the waterline and I know it's not
the same exact color or anything but
it's just the same color family it's
along those lines blue paint
periwinkle we're gonna do it okay
if you guys want to do something so bold
going use up friggin cream liner a black
liner doesn't really matter taking the
same solstice palette I completely
forgot to highlight my like body a
morphe m32 6 and that same champagne
shade on put that in the inner corner
just giving some a highlight back to the
high because everything is pretty matte
and a little bit on the brow bone as
well oh this is so bright and
boom right so now we have everything
down I'm gonna go and curl my lashes and
apply some mascara off-camera really
quickly and this is the final I look I
put on a Russian black lashes by new
bounce um this is the lashes I've been
wearing all month right now that my
go-to edge of eyes they give you such a
beautiful like outer corner elongated
look like out here they taper down so
it's like a nice smaller last year and
they kind of flare how and I think they
look so good I've been wearing them
non-stop all month tons of you I've been
asking me on my social media like what
lashes I've been wearing and it's
Russian black and by new bounce um I
love these lashes so much me going to me
guys didn't see what they look like up
close
so let's one finish off the entire look
with the lips now I'm gonna go in with a
nice affordable lip combination because
that's kind of I've been feeling
recently this looks I'm going with Nick
speakable neutral which you guys know a
favorite lip liner basically all time
and really applying my lips
perfect so this is the lip right now and
then I'm going with a new lipstick I got
I actually hold it for you guys I'll go
out back it's a drugstore one this is
the maybelline blushing beige lipstick
it's just really cute and it's really
pretty I think it's like a satin creamy
lipstick something that is a really
pretty very nude lipstick which I want
to go with what today's eye look
the first person I ever saw using this
was Jamie Paige Beauty here on YouTube
