this is from Z Gallerie the desk
actually the desk is from Z Gallerie the
chairs from Z Gallerie I have a little
thing right here is from Z Gallerie the
box and that's MC gallery as well I'm
obsessed with Z gallery as you can see
I'm actually teamed up with them
recently to do a little like photo shoot
in my room super cute but they left a
couple items here which I love so this
is what the section looks like this is
where actually edit um my videos on cool
so we're walking over walking walking to
the left this is the first thing we see
and we are here this is a tray
I'm Zi and these are from the gallery as
well this actually where I keep all my
colognes and perfumes I'd like to work
cologne and perfume I like to mix and
match them because I think it smells
really really pretty and really really
masculine at the same time so I like
that fragrance as well as this is a tall
alec store from Ikea that is a food tray
that I used to help from my videos with
so that's what that is on the side but
yeah this is what it looks like and then
you see this section over here oh ma oh
jeez
so let's start on the side so this is my
foundation drawers I chose down this
guy's a little bright
hey you yeah that's better
so this is my foundation section the hey
I touched in order turned on these are
the foundations that I use there's a
shit-ton I'm a foundation order tons of
stuff over here this is an a makeup
collection video I just kind of showing
you guys what I'm talking about I'm not
going to do a huge like show you guys
all my makeup or anything at that but I
just wanted to show you guys a little
bit of it this is a vanity mirror that I
have from impressions a vanity which I
absolutely love it's dimmable which I
love about it and it also actually has a
charger over here to like charge my
phone
while I'm doing makeup love it so then
we go over here I'm a nice little
lipstick tawa and then we have a lazy
susan that has a whole my brushes on it
and bath bombs in the middle just to be
fucking Q you know like I want to be
Halo you know and then we have this
section over here there's more stuff
this all this stuff are here
it's just exercise I have not put away
yet it just bear with me the new Auto
Sasa glow kits can we just have a moment
I am obsessed huh
and then my dad also just put this up
I'm so happy I love it it's a cute
little shelf there's also that one so I
really really really love it and have
like this cute looking that mom got me
for Christmas
queen of damn near everything ain't got
the fucking truth
serenity my first collaboration my mom
did a shout a box event and yeah I
talked to some cute things these are the
morphe brushes that everyone has been
raving about especially neetu these are
the ones that have nice like pretty
blingy on it and I absolutely love them
love can't wave em to come back and then
this section is where I keep my
motherfuckin lights and my camera it's
just this is the disaster under this
section like it's all the cords and the
wires and the shit I don't care about
random so these are also Alex drawers
all every corner is an Alex Shore and
the table tops are from Ikea and the
lazy susan my dad built so that's
awesome you can just like go out and buy
some my dad made this and he also made
this little corner section because the
desks wouldn't connect so my dad is
quite handy he's handy manny because his
name is Manuel too so that's actually
that's true
this is my other wall these are my
paintings these are the dancing girls
from Z Gallerie I've peacock and I have
fuchsia and I love them and this is also
a mirror from the gallery that they
brought me what's up
so kids what's up children I guess doing
right below this is my couch this is
what you guys have seen before I usually
like to film I'll sit down right here
and film with this is my background
because I really like having a couch is
my background I think it's kind of fun
pillows are from Zi eat sleep contour
this from time Los Angeles and then
let's make out this was sent to me by a
brand I don't know which one it was but
I'm like ok the brand was like let's
make out I'm like ok shit my rug is from
overstock.com there's one from Z
Gallerie that's very very very similar
but the overstock 1 is cheaper so I'm
like yo mom was on a budget let's get
that shit so now we're going to my room
section so this is my room side this I
would say is like my work side and then
this is my room side ok doesn't my bed
my bed is actually really really really
extravagant like much more so than the
average person needs to be honest is a
fucking queen-size bed with pokes and
freaking sheets going across like it's
super extravagant super gay but I love
it like I'm just I don't
every time I mean wow hit me I'm time
here I don't like laying it and just
like frolic naked you know I don't know
if that makes sense but you know so yeah
so I have a bunch of pillows on my bed
right now these are the ones from Z
Gallerie and then we turn around go to
180 and then I have this little couch
here pillows from Z Gallerie it's like
the other pillow but in the black
version and then that is from Pier 1
it's a nice little like quilted throw
and I love it obsessed swatches on the
hand what is new and then we go to this
section right over here right next to it
and you see some fun little mirrored
things I'm a mirrored bitch I love
mirrors I love to look in the mirrors
Hey Hey but yes in my travel bag so I
take to travel with me all the time
honestly like all this shit is from Z
Gallerie like Loki I bought the dresser
I bought the lamp and I bought the
flowers this is from Z Gallerie they
when they brought me stuff and in the
little owls I bought myself I actually
love it can we just talk about this and
have a moment because a moment of
silence for this do you see this always
being of
an idiot and try to hang up a painting
up here just goes like this walls kind
of barren and I didn't do it right it
fell down and it cracked my motherfuckin
dresser so obviously emails Egon I was
like please Lord tell me that you guys
to sell the drawers individually and
they're like yeah let me so anyone and
so they're sending me one thing God and
then this bad boy I saved my life more
than once this is an AC you think I
would be dead without it to be honest
because the summer's here are fucking
hot in San Diego yeah and then we go
over here just a little corner and I
have some more stuff this is a little
mini trunk don't remember I got this to
be honest word I get you mmm darn or a
little spell book because I'm a witch ah
B and then I have some more losses and
flowers and a little lamp from Pier one
which I love because as like roses on it

like so cute so gaudy so me gag-worthy
