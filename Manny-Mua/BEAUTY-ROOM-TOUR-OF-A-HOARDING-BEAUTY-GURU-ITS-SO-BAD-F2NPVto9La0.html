so today's video is starting a little
bit different I'm actually filming this
on my phone right now because today's
video is going to be a beauty room tour
in depth we're gonna show the whole
 thing and it is a mess ok guys
so basically so this is what it looks
like when it's clean when it's dirty
it's a whole nother story I was thinking
you know maybe I should hold off on this
video because I want to show you guys
like my best foot forward and make it
look like I'm super organized and looks
amazing and better that but the reality
of the situation is that's not always so
glamorous and it doesn't look that
gorgeous all the time and I just want to
show you guys the reality of what it
actually is this is my actual medium is
what I film it every single day so I get
ready in and I'm just gonna show you
guys what kind of horror that I really
have so cuz it's really real it's really
 real so as those video is going
to be I'm just gonna go and do a little
bit of a tour with you guys and just
kind of show you guys around my room
show you guys what it looks like when
you walk in and I'll show you guys a
little bit my organisation where you can
get some of them a lot of you guys want
to see what my filming setup looks like
which I will show is wolf you guys woman
goat in dev and really dive into my
filming set up I can double e do a
separate video on that because that's
its own separate video that is too
 long but I can definitely do
that for you guys if you guys were
interested but yeah today there's going
to be as always if you guys don't like
this video you guys don't like me please
don't watch acknowledged ill
with that
but if you guys do like this one give it
a thumbs up and let me love you guys
liked this kind of video where am I
giving a tour or just kind of letting
you guys in a little bit more to see the
behind the scenes I've seen so many
people post their tour videos and I love
them I'm very inspired by it
Desi's a beauty room I love seeing
Laurel Beauty room James just did an
apartment tour I love tours
they're incredible and it's
gonna change out because I'm wanting to
move soon so yeah let's just go again
right into the video so we opened it and
this is what we see we've seen my setup
we see all these going on I know you
guys have seen a little bit behind the
scenes because of mr. K she came in and
we did my Beauty room and we decorated
it and of course a lot of it is the same
decoration from a mr. Cade did it she's
incredible
a leave her link down below she's
amazing but I definitely updated it a
bit more since than my god so what's
going to start on the left side first so
this is where a lot of my makeup is
stored as we can see the top section is
a disaster it's as organized as I can
for now I just don't have a lot of space
basically what I want to do is like have
those acrylic drawers flying the entire
thing I've just been a super super busy
but anyway the top of it looks like this
this used to be a drawer I had like
collaborations and things like that in
things that I was like super proud of
and other influencer collaborations and
things like that but they got filled up
because I needed more space
and then we have Beauty blenders in this
section a lot of them some extra brushes
rhinestones I can also do a really
in-depth like into the drawers deep dive
and I can definitely do that for you
guys if you guys want to see that this
is gonna be an overview of what I have
and then these guys oh my gosh whoa now
these right here so these are
actually shoe containers from The
Container Store there is super super
inexpensive in comparison to acrylic
drawers and what I did was I just got
little like shoe containers and put
dividers in them and that's how we
divided some things this used to be my
like drugstore section I wanted to be
all drugstore on the top and then my
high-end in the bottom again we ran out
of space we couldn't do that so what I
have is like I had these huge ones which
these are like closed ones these are
like for clothes like foundations in
here this trick I learned from desi
Perkins she uses these acrylic doors and
I just think it's genius that's what I
learned from her video and what do you
know here's my palette looking like a
goddamn supermodel oh these were custom
mean Kate did these ourselves like
painting whereas we painted these blush
she can't just buy these normally just
like normal like drawers but every
single drawer has like a purpose I
suppose you can say so like the for
example this drawer is highlighters so
you would see that we have non organized
highlighters in here so unorganized
we have pencils like brow products on
this side concealers on this side
setting sprays in the center palettes we
have palettes galore in this section and
down here as well all these drawers are
completely filled up with different
things this guy is lipsticks just some
of them this is like a small small
amount of what I have and here we have
lashes I can't even open the drawer
because I literally have a Nicole
Guerrero what is your ass doing in there
open or Nicole Guerrero you let me open
this door right now okay
working the Saints opening spirit I
swear it's filled with flashes to the
brim I can live so I will do a deep dive
in my drawers if you guys are interested
in seeing that I just think would be
kind of cool show you guys what I really
haven't here I would do a huge
declutter and I will assume so anyway
this is my desk and this is what you see
this is my camera we have my lights we
have my balance back boards at Tula and
we have my desk this is what I use when
I'm phone using my microphone and this
is what I see when I film so this is
behind me this is my background you guys
see all the time my little
stands here in case I want to like have
a backdrop right there's a stands you
know my other chair when I do
collaborations some lights this place is
a mess down here we don't talk about
this this is a mess all this right
here
no so this is also just some things I
use more immediately these are things
that I just like take quickly on the go
these are really really fast and then
this is my travel bag that I travel with
all the time as my brushes in it has
everything that I use in quick jiffy
let's go move on over here we have it
this section right here so this section
here is things that I got recently in PR
like newer things so basically do me and
my assistantship puts all the new things
like NPR in these two containers and
I'll go through them throughout the week
and see if I want to use any of the
products and things like that to see if
I want to film with anything and if I
don't if I just leave him in here I was
looking for a brush if I don't
want to use anything from here she'd end
up just putting them away back into the
sections as she knows where to put him
in the car little like assigned areas so
basically this is like my like testing
new new comes into here
section we haven't like revamp this in
weeks just we've been busy as
hell the closet you guys are going to
 scream cuz this is someone
recognized but we're trying so we go
into here and what do we have more so we
have pencils we have some two-faced
goodies we're trying to separate things
by brands now we're really really trying
to like it it's a cure not pencils
necessary we're trying to do like things
by brands here we have by the boss
Natasha - Nonna talk show skin care with
palettes and your highlighters Jesse
right in there we have so much stuff NYX
color pump we have so many things also
back here you guys we have backdrops
that I use for my backgrounds I've
literally just rolls and rolls of paper
backdrops I just toss it in if I want to
have a backdrop depends on my mood and
have fabric ones right over here they're
kind of a bitch on camera I'm not gonna
lie
this is actually kind of like more
special effects you type stuff like
paints and things like that as we can
see like a bald cap and up here we just
have our random ass tech things which oh
that's an Aikido wing right there a
dragon wing these are light jellies and
these you just put over a light to give
it like a little bit of a different
effect just like different little tricks
and tips if you guys want me to do it an
in-depth one of these I told you guys I
would do with that if you guys want let
me know in the comments Barbie lo you
guys want me to do a full filming setup
situation what I use and things like
that because that's its own video for
sure but for those of you guys who do
wonder I use the Canon EOS 5d Mark four
and I always put it in autofocus no just
because it's easier for me because I
film by myself I don't have anyone to
help me film so that is basically hey
you guys I mean it's organized enough
for what I can handle right at this
moment but when I move I'm gonna be
doing a huge decluttering and I'm gonna
get rid of so many things I'd no longer
use cuz all these drawers here have so
much product I no longer use so I really
really want to do a big decluttering and
if you guys wanna see that - let me know
down below my wife Tilbury random mess
 I don't know where we got these
cards I think I got them at Target these
are really really practical or when you
just want to like have a quick little
thing toss some guys in there and then
just kind of keep it moving when do your
thing but anyways guys that is it for my
room tour this is my beauty room this is
the room that I film it all the time Wow
a plethora of my time honestly
but this is I got a lot of these little
cute trinkets and things like that from
the Z Gallerie from Pier one I try to
switch it up as much as I can with the
background but yes people get complacent
and by people I mean me and I get
 tired and I like my back anyways
you guys thank you so so so much for
watching today's video of you guys enjoy
it it's just kind of an insight of what
my beauty room looks like just kind of
seeing everything if you guys want to
see me do a deep dive into the drawers
and actually see what's in the drawers
like deep down in the crevices see
what's really that t let me know
and we can definitely definitely make
that happen
okay worst of the night or day where you
guys are and I'll catch you guys in my
next video bye guys
I love you what so you guys that is my
bedroom
No
when going over that shouldn't miss a
shot that fair I thought you know what
the can I toss to be Jedi and what
the man beside my door and it is opening
on its own which is creepy
I'm not gonna lie I thought is my
mom's extensions right here mom
