today's video is going to be a haul
video I have not done a haul video in
quite a while and today's a special
edition haul because I'm actually
partnering up with Beauty Bay which is a
London UK distributor this video is
sponsored with them so I'm so so excited
and so honored to really be working with
them let's know how I feel about
sponsorships I haven't done a
sponsorship in months and months and
months since I did the taking off my
makeup video because I feel like when it
comes to sponsorships and it comes to
those things like random tangent let
just go on a tangent when it comes to
sponsorships I just feel like if the
brand is trying to change who you are if
the branch trying to change your opinion
of the brands trying to take you and
make you something that you're not that
is when a sponsorship is not for me you
know what I mean but when brands like
Beauty Bay are like hey we want to send
you color products want you just do a
haul video it's sponsored and just give
us your opinion and I'm like great I can
be myself that sounds fantastic so thank
you so much to beautybay for being a
brand that wants to work with me and
wants to work with me as manny and not
as someone else that's not me so thank
you guys so much for working with me and
I'm really excited because I just love
hulls you know I like they're so much
fun so hey why not doing with Beauty BAE
so thank you guys again I really
appreciate it think of like a Sephora
but for the UK where like people that
are in the UK and so having to buy from
over here in the United States they get
sent a ton of products from the US over
there and then you can buy it from there
rather than having to go deal with the
customs and all those fees are attached
with it like it just really sucks so if
you are not in the United States this is
gonna be a great video for you because
there is brands like Beauty Bay who have
a lot of brands that they work with so
let's going into this haul as always if
you guys don't like this video if you
guys do not like me please don't
watch it you know the joke that but if
you guys do like this video please give
it a thumbs up and subscribe to my
channel if you are already and if you
knew what's up a man um your way and
welcome to my channel thank you so much
for being here
I really appreciate it yeah let's get
into this beauty BAE
oh come on glitter lips
okay so let's go ahead and start on two
days haul video so first things first
right in front of me I'm going to be
pulling up the makeup geek Kathleen
lights highlighting palette you guys
have seen this palette it's beautiful
Beauty Bay has makeup geek there so they
also do have my palette the mani mu a
makeup geek palette that we collaborated
with this year they have that there as
well but they have Kathleen's palette is
a one know I've used this before I use
it on Lauren when I did her makeup on a
previous video when I Trent when I did
like a transformation on her but I just
love this palette so much I think the
making geek highlighters are beautiful I
think they're very very smooth very
fantastic and especially the ones that
are not do come with other ones those
are fantastic and rebate dust I'll make
it products so if you guys are
interested in makeup geek things but
live in the UK Beauty big got you
handled I actually have one of these
products already so one of these will be
going into a giveaway next thing I got
the Anastasia Beverly Hills brow definer
in the shade dark brown the brow definer
by Anastacio is so good it's so good I
just love this pencil so much I love
that its taper I love that has a
teardrop shape it's not too waxy but
it's not too pigmented either it's the
right amount of pigment so I really just
like that a lot and has a split on the
other and obviously I use a shade dark
brown for my brows and I just think they
work fantastically again unassociated
sold on beautybay so guys are struggling
to find on a saucy in the UK or you
don't want to pay for custom fees or
whatever be to be have you Han don't
next product is going to be a beauty
banner so I think I sent a Beauty
Blender I love you to miners do you guys
know this um beauty burners are
phenomenal for putting on your makeup I
literally use Beauty blenders every
single day whether it's apply foundation
whether it's to take away like
streakiness from a brush it's just
Beauty blenders are the way to go I love
YouTube under so much and I have a good
5 on hand so here's one more here is a
foundation I have been dying going to
try this is the Illamasqua skin base if
you guys don't know Illamasqua is like
kind of hard to find in the United
States actually it's not based out of
the United States I believe it's
somewhere else I don't know exactly
where the heck elet mask was based but
you can buy on the Beauty a website and
they will send it to you in the US if
you guys are interested but I've heard
so many things about this and they used
to be sold on Sephora I believe I could
be wrong but I've been really really
wanting
try it's a skin based I hear that's like
medium coverage it's really really nice
okay
it is thicker than I thought I thought
was gonna be like a little oh yeah it's
like very thick gel like actually the
coverage is nice it's very much there
it's like full coverage from on my hand
I'll play with on my face and see what I
think about it but I did grab one of
these illamasqua skin base and this is
the shade e to aim low so my most
excited item of the entire haul is this
yes this is a Z palette and yes we've
seen Z palettes before yes I understand
but I have never seen a Z palette like
this before so it is a Z palette
normally of course you pop the bad girl
open Z palette right right so what is a
Z palette but oh I just love this sorry
I'm like geeking over this is like a
bill thing I was freaking out about it
comes with a mirror that is magnetized
and you can literally pop the
mirror onto this so you can literally
like see yourself this is the one thing
on the site that was like like I was
gasping for air over it's just so cool
I've never I just never seen this before
I've never seen a Z palette like I think
this is just such a genius thing so it's
like boom little just a little mirror
it's so cute to me bug and if you want
you just same keep it close if you want
to keep it like that at all times or you
can just open it take it off put the
bad-boy back in this little component
 Z palette where were you at when I
needed you and I needed then where were
you I was waiting for you okay next item
is from BH Cosmetics this is the
professional blush 10 color blush
palette I've actually never really used
BH Cosmetics before so this is actually
really intriguing to me because it's one
of those brands it's like one of those
brands that you like kind of start
makeup with you know it's like it
reminds me of like a morphe kind of
situation even though I like packaging
it's like that kind of packaging where
it's like ooh ten blushes they feel
smooth I mean that's pigmented so you'll
see this one with that one felt really
great that one right there
I felt nice so basically they're but
they're all matte blushes boom
boom swatched right here all four of
them up there I had to play with that to
actually put out my face to see how they
are but they do sell BH Cosmetics which
is really really cool
I believe BHS one of those brands are
like really really cost-effective
especially if you're like beginning to
start into makeup trying to create a kit
or whatever it might be
BH is one of those great alternatives
but hey I never really use them I can't
really speak too much about them I just
received this so this is one thing I got
from Midway next item of course my baby
my baby girl jeffree star cosmetics
products beauty bait also carries
jeffree star cosmetics they are the only
brand inside the UK that carries jeffree
star cosmetics I believe I could be
wrong but I'm pretty sure they're the
only ones and I have what I have here
with me is doll parts stunning stunning
and I have unicorn blood lipstick boom I
actually have both of these products
already so I'm either gonna have to give
in to my mom or put them into a giveaway
the giveaway that I have coming up in
December so if you guys want to see me
toss these bad boys in the giveaway let
me know in the comments or below like
this video if you guys want me to add
some stuff from here into the giveaway
no one has going to my mommy uh-huh so
again dog parts unicorn blood obsessed
die living breathing you guys know I'm
obsessed with every star cosmetics I'm
upset with Jeffrey star himself you know
it's my best friend so does that and
last but not least Buick carries these
little bags so beautifu has like a
little bag and it's like you buy the bag
and it comes with little products in it
so I'm actually kind of excited bout
this because I thought this like really
really cool it reminds you stuff for it
in a way where like they do those
bundles at the end of the year worth
like a ton of little bundles like a
holiday bundle Beauty has it as well
which is super super cool this one comes
with a Beauty Blender sick as hell
here's another it comes with a morphe
m-43 9 which is one of the best
foundation brushes you could ever try
it's absolutely amazing from morphe they
also carry more feet on beautybay
website which is sick as they have
a Anastacio brow is in the shade medium
brown i can make this work I won't make
this bring in more I will use that fake
oh my gosh it's a lot of it comes
with that I do liquid liner oh my god
there's more no comes with a gerard
cosmetics liquid lipstick in the shade
and then it off
comes with a little eyeshadow it comes
with an eyeshadow from makeup geek the
bitten eyeshadow so it's bitten this is
the heroes in dark kit this is really
cool like actually really really cool
things like this are really genius I
love them Breton's do this but I do like
