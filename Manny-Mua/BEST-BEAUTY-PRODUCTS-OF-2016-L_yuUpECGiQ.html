today's video is going to be my best of
beauty 2016 I'm so excited to be filming
this you guys have no idea you guys
already know favorite videos like you're
already my favorite better like really
Haley I love them end of the year
favorite is like hmm you know I mean
like it's just everything so I'm so so
so excited to film this I'm sorry it's
coming at you a little bit late I had
surgery recently on my hairline that's
one wearing a Harry now I had already
pre filmed so many videos I was like
there's no way I can get this done but I
asked to pull on Twitter and you guys
still said that you guys did want to see
it even though it's coming at you a
little bit late it's kind of weird like
filming I haven't filmed in like a month
because I have so much pre film stuff
random so I know I'm not gonna be
talking in major major detail per
product because you guys have seen me
use these products throughout the entire
year so I'm like you know what I'm not
gonna waste you guys just time you guys
know why I love it some should explain
to you a little bit of like why I like
the product and move on I'm not gonna
keep it going like for 70 minutes like
no it's not gonna be anything like that
it's gonna be a quick fast movement and
I'm also not gonna be including my
collaborations I did this year I did a
collaboration with Oprah I did three
like the lipsticks and I did they make a
geek man emu eye palette I'm not gonna
be including them because I've talked
about them so much on my channel
already and you guys already know
they're gonna be my favorites anyway so
I'm not gonna include them just because
this is gonna be my favorites from other
brands different products and stuff like
that because if I clog on the product
it's probably my favorite so I'm just
not gonna include it in this video but
yeah I decided that I'm gonna be filming
an entire video on just my favorite 2016

disappointed products of 2016 and I also
want to fill my favorites skincare of

and welcome to my channel that you so
much for being here you can call me
daddy if you want you know feel free
call me daddy it's cool it's cool
let's against his video
until I kept back let's start with some
basic products we're gonna start with
the face things and move on to the eyes
and move on to whatever where the
we are doing okay
my number one primer of 2016 has to be
benefit Porefessional I fell in love
with it like three years ago when I
first started doing makeup and I kind of
like faint away started using other
primers and things like that same effect
very like pore filling silicon based
primers but I always just end up going
back to the professional I just think
it's so good it's so great for people
that are oily dry combination it just
works great I mean if you're dryer you
definitely want to use like a really
hydrating moisturizer before you use
this because it is more for keeping oil
at bay but it just works so well at
filling in your pores making your skin
looks very very smooth and honestly I
don't think I could live without this
product in 2016 at all so definitely
figure primer up next is foundations and
I think you guys are going to know
exactly what foundations I'm going to be
talking about you can't go wrong with
these that you cannot go wrong with
these this is the Make Up For Ever Ultra
HD stick this is the third one I've gone
through this year or so I have left in
here I love this foundation because it's
a full coverage and it gives you a very
nice natural like life fight finish even
though it's full coverage and you can
use a little bit for like a minimal
coverage a lot for full it just works so
freaking nicely and I love it so much
and I always mix them together I always
mix the Dior air flash which is my other
second favorite foundation of the year
this is a aerosol spray foundation that
you just like literally like spray that
you let me just spray out of the can and
it also gives you a nice light weight to
full coverage look this one is beautiful
over this one so I'll do is I'll put
like this is my like base one and I'll
put this all over my face and I blend
them two together and it just gives me
the most beautiful ass finish it looks
very lifelike full coverage but still
very beautiful on the skin and very just
like flawless looking I just ain't even
enamel also I love the hourglass vanish
stick foundation but I've been using
these a lot longer for thought the
entire year over that one so I gotta
keep these two in my faves you know cuz
I got a rep like you guys I can wrapping
you guys because you guys have been here
something for the two concealers that I
chose for 2016 best concealers my
favorite concealers are these guys so if
you guys watched beauty videos because
follow any Beauty people on YouTube or
we're not you guys will know that this
Tarte shape tape has been like literally
slaying the scene for concealers
everyone's obsessed with it and it's for
good reason it's literally the most
intense full coverage very easily to
blend fricking concealer of all time I
absolutely love it this is like my
number one favorite for the whole entire
year but I cannot deny that I used open
decay naked weightless the entire first
part of the year you know this came out
like five months ago I don't really know
I had to say that the Urban Decay Naked
weightless another full coverage
beautiful creamy easy to blend out
concealer has been my favorite through
2016 as well I use them both
interchangeably I just use the Tarte one
a little bit more because it's more full
coverage and more intense and you know
me I'm a Jaclyn I mean I'm not
really directly but I love to be full
coverage full like slay bitch client
like I love that I love all of it both
are absolutely amazing and I think that
2016 was a fantastic year for concealers
and I don't even know if 2017 is gonna
go to top lie concealers of 2016 so
let's let's pray I mean who knows next
we're going to talk about powders I've
been letting throw entire 1216 and you
guys are probably gonna know this is the
Laura Mercier loose setting powder in
the shade translucent you guys honestly
if you guys are a li combination this is
gonna be the powder for you it's so so
finely milled is the most beautiful like
airbrush finish especially when you cook
on your face and neck you bake it into
your skin leave it on for a couple
minutes and you remove it it's the most
beautiful like flawless finish of all
the powders I've tried this entire
entire year but the other powder that
competed very very very intensely with
this powder has been the RC mate no
color powder that I use as well the
reason I like this so much is I like to
cook underneath my eyes and set my
concealer with this powder I don't
really ever use this all over my face
I'll do it just underneath my eyes all
the way out but other than that I will
not use this powder all over the face
because this doesn't work
give my oils at bay intensely but it
does keep me from creasing so well so
 well I don't know it's also very
finely milled it's very magical I don't
know Kathleen started a craze with this
 and I know why it's
literally so so so great and it's also
very very cheap it's like 13 bucks and
if you guys cannot merge on the Laura
Mercier I would deathly suggest the RCM
a if your dryer use RCM a if your oily
ur use Laura Mercier best powders of the
year in my opinion holy however my
number one bronzer for the entire year
has been the Marc Jacobs
tantric bronzer this bronzer
I don't know what the is in this
honestly I don't know what kind of
 witchcraft is up in this bitch
but it's literally the most beautiful
like terracotta warm brown matte bronzer
ever it's so so so stunning and it's so
massive like I use this so much and I
haven't even hit pan I've used this for
a good like eight months in a row every
time I do makeup I use this haven't hit
pan
I don't know how witchcraft again if
there's any bronzer got the entire year
other than the Physicians Formula butter
bronzer which I love too this is my
number one because this has been with me
the entire year and I travel with it and
you know if you if you travel something
you know that she is and that's
unreal look two highlighters that I
loved so much throughout the year have
been one the sleek solstice palette like
honestly this shade is Navy that is me
 vida it's difficult cause this
highlighter is kind of controversial
because it's so metallic like
gnarly metallic on the face it very much
is so if you have drier skin it get
bumpy your skin then you might not like
it you know you might not like think
that this is the best powder for you and
you might not think like oh like this is
gonna go to my skin because it like
emphasizes the pores emphasizes the
texture it does most highlighters will
but this is an extra umph because it's
 Metallica's tits
oh god it's Mandela I personally
love a high intense shine highlighter
and I do have texture and I do have
large pores and I'm a dude but I
honestly I'm not the type of person to
really care that much I let's have a
massive zit on my cheek then
I'll still wear highlighter because I
don't really care that much I don't mind
if it emphasized in my text and I don't
mind if emphasizes my pores because
that's just what reality is I have
texture and I have pores you have
texture who cares not just kind of how I
feel and I love a good metallic strong
highlight so the sleek solstice palette
has been my favorite for the entire year
Jaqueline started crazy with this bitch
and for good ringing and my
second favorite highlighter has been the
Jew a citroen highlighter zu a Citroen
you guys I went to Paris with you a how
honestly and they came out with
highlighters when we're there in Paris
Citroen is the lightest of the three and
it's so so beautiful it's like a
beautiful white champagne shade it's
very great on lighter complexions if
you're a darker in complexion it might
be really really really light and
intense on you which is totally fine if
you're into that look but there's also
shade topaz and rose quartz that would
work great on you the texture of these
highlighters guys is so amoliant like it
feels like almost like the powder
or wet which makes them very very very
like not durable I've already shattered
my first three because I traveled with
them so much as I loved them all and
they all shattered with me none of my
highlighters shatter like this does so I
would definitely suggest not to travel
with it as much but if you guys want a
nice intense metallic highlighter that
looks so before the skin that's not
gonna break the bank these are like not
that expensive I believe they're like 20
something dollars and I'm an affiliate
issue a you know use my code man emu way
to save fifteen percent off on top of
that but Joey's highlighters really when
they launched these I was very very
impressed
check out the G way highlighters
absolutely amazing the sleek enjoy my
number ones for the whole here
I'm so handsy today I'm sorry like I
want to just like mmm you know blush was
really really hard to choose blush was a
 tough one to choose but I did
use something throughout the entire year
that I did absolutely love and that is
the morphe 9-n blush palette
specifically the 9-n because these are
more like Coralie blushes that i like i
mixed this one and this one I mess with
on my cheeks right now it's just such a
pretty blush palette they're so
pigmented that most of them are matte a
little bit of shimmers in it as well for
a blush palette this is my number one
like this has been such a nice palette
they also have the 9b which is great as
well but the color scheme of the 9-n is
so much more on my alley if you guys
like corals you guys like pinks if you
guys like peachy shades for the blush
check out the night and it's like 15
bucks I'm not really sure exactly but
these are extremely pigmented and I
traveled with this one and they're not
oh man oh my god I know it's stupid
and if I would suggest anything
throughout the year to just kind of
trouble with something easy something
sleek for blushes that's all it's all I
need to honesty is all I need and so
definitely check out the morphe tonight
in I'm going to Philly it man emu a code
if you want to save some money on it
you're not oh good great pal okay so - I
pallets that I've left throughout this
entire year other than the mani anyway
makeup geek palette that is my rule and
these are honestly both my number one
for different reasons if I'm going for
specific looks I'll go to these two
palettes and they are the modern
Renaissance and the morphe 35o that is
what it is man these are my top two
palettes the modern renaissance
average has gotten some love other than
this shade warm taupe every other shades
got especially these have
been this big um it's actually what I'm
wearing on my eyes right now it's the
entire palette is on my
it's so great like when this came out
this like shook the
Internet you know like this was
sold out for so long I'm sure it could
be still out now I don't even know that
shadows are so so buttery so pigmented
there's a lot of Fallout doesn't mehron
but usually when there's really really
pigmented shades that's just what
happens I can suggest you guys one of
two pallets about the entire year I
would suggest the modern renaissance
it's so fantastic and I think that this
is a permanent palette in Anasazi s
collection now so if you guys give me
your hands on it get it it's so
worth the money like honestly and the
second of course pad that I love so so
much is the morphe 35o this one is
doesn't get as dirty as quickly which is
kind of nice if I'm going for something
really burnt in orange and really deep
and intense I will reach for 3500 and I
know a lot of you guys are always like
so skeptical about morphe and you're
like oh my god like they don't work that
great but how many like if they do not
work for you I'm sorry I'm really really
sorry that I'm talking about this and it
doesn't work for you but for me they
work so well like honestly so
just one matte orange I don't know how
people say more fees like this shittiest
brand like I don't I really don't see it
in my mind I don't understand and I'm
not just saying that because I'm an
affiliate and I that I get paid for them
you guys know I'm an affiliate I do earn
a little Commission manof them when you
guys use my code that's just what it is
but it doesn't mean that I'm gonna say
the product is great if it's not great
you know I'm saying like it just is the
 shadows are bomb these two and
my palette are like all the palettes I
really need for what I love to do on my
eyes if you have the 3500 let me know if
it works for you or not in the comments
or below I would love to see like an
open topic of discussion
does it work good for you like is it
nice and pigmented and blendable for you
guys to glitters for the year have
killed me slayed me brought me back to
life first one I'm talking about is the
Urban Decay heavy metal glitter liner in
the shade Midnight Cowboy
it's what I'm wearing on my eyes right
now it's what I have it down here that's
what I have in my crease as well you
guys these glitters are just so easy to
use and I think that's why I like them
so much as odd is like you painted on
and they just work so well they stay on
your eyes all day like 10 hours plus
like they're just such great glares and
they're so reflective and so intense
like look at that like look at that
 I feel like for beginners or people
that like don't want to dabble they're
kind of intimidated by glitter a little
bit check out the heavy metal liners in
general they have a full range I love
them especially Midnight Cowboy that's
my number one and in the second glare I
loved for this year has been Mac reflex
pearl reflex pearl came back into my
life
this year and I don't think I could ever
go without it again honestly I don't
remember I spelled a little bit of an in
a hotel and I had like pick a little bit
up and put it back and I felt kind like
a like a coke whore because it was like
a little pile of white dust I'm like
being a little fiend you know but
whatever just that's what you do when
you like eleven something I Simone I
just love reflux Pro because it's such a
beautiful white bright pearlescent
intense ass reflective glitter of all
the glitters I have reflux pearls my
most intense the one I use the most and
the one that get the most compliments on
so you guys want a glitter that's gonna
really be like a WOW factor on your face
and like people will be like holy tits
grab reflux Pro by Mac you will not be
disappointed it's the best glitter ever
eye primer Smashbox 24-hour if yo oily
lids if you have dry lids if you have
combination lids this primer will save
you it will bring you back to life it
will give you mouth-to-mouth and it will
bring you back to life
I have very oily lids I have an oily
face I'm a oil slick as opposed
basically I need something to last me
all day long and do not crease on my
eyes nothing like I cannot have creases
when I'm at events like it's just
embarrassing I don't want to have crease
Ã¤j-- Smashbox 24 hour is the primer
that I've used has the least amount of
creases on me 12 hours plus I don't know
what the fuck's in here which grafting
in and if you guys don't have Creasy
oily lids try out this one just try it
out get a sample from Sephora and just
test it on your lids a little bit goes a
long way and you will not be using
favorite mascara of than your husband
runner this is probably like my fourth
maybe for the fifth - we've gone through
roller lash has been with me this is
entire here and in seen a lot it's seen
a look like a lot of tears and is still
staying on you know I like what this
mascara is that it really keeps my curl
you don't even need to curl your lashes
that much to be able to get a nice curl
with this one it separates lashes well
it gives me volume if you guys want a
nice full looking lashes check out
benefit roller lash mascara that's a go
eyeliner so this is from colour-pop this
is their eyeliner these are the color
pop to the writing that she came off
basically so I love the color pop water
liners like the little eyeliner like the
pencil eyeliners I think they're
fantastic they're so pigmented they're
so creamy they stay on the water running
all day long like they have no transfer
I'm like dude how the did you make
these like five or six bucks actually
wearing the white in my waterline right
now and it just works so well so
bright and then my favorite black
eyeliner for the waterline ardency in
monster this mother
it's so dark it's so creamy and blends
up so easily when I'm trying to do a
smoky lashline underneath this will
blend out really quickly um it doesn't
set too fast where I'm like like
trying to blend out with super super
quickly favorite pair of lashes for 2016
come on I'm gonna need you guys to tell
me hey relax just come on
with me on three one two three fellas ha
ha honestly guys Bella buy new bounce um
just lashes I'm wearing right now I've
gone through maybe dropped entire year
hmm I use like only like one per month
though so I would say like I've gone
through maybe like 10 pairs of these
lashes they are my favourite lashes
they're the most intense
drag-ass 3d mean crazy looking lashes I
have they work so well on me because I'm
a guy obviously you guys know me hi I'm
Annie my name's Mandy have a gog because
I have a more masculine face when I'm
not in full makeup you need to do like
kind of dramatic things to compensate to
make you look a little bit more feminine
and so lashes like this really helped me
feminized my face a lot more to give me
more of like a pretty look and that's
kind of why I wear lashes like this is
because they're dramatic and they're
exactly what I need I'm obsessed with
them use code Manning anyway if you want
to save any money on the whole time to
bounce some range these lashes I I
really could not like live without those
lashes really like look at that
look at that's last but not least of the
eye products this is the Kat Von D super
eyeliner I need an eyeliner to not be
felt like I cannot really do a nice
intense wing with the felt tip eyeliner
I think it's kind of hard I'm like this
like spongy applicator it's
pissing me off what I love about
Havanese trooper is that it's a bristle
tip I didn't even use concealer to clean
up this wing this is just by this up
I'll just like like if I want to draw a
little heart in my face right now I
could do it with this because it's such
a fine tip that is it for the eye
products and face products now we're
just moving on to lips and we'll be
 done go so lip liners of this
year that have been giving me life in
prison with the bitch realness have been
the urban decay ones urban decay lip
liners this year I've really really
given me life like I don't know what
about them like they're creamy dip it
minted they glide so easily I'm like
this is in the shape naked I'm almost
gone with it as you can see I use it all
the time it's for all the nude lipsticks
I wear I use a shade naked like come on
love love these lip liners they're
absolutely amazing and they last all day
on me they're just great also I love the
color pop lip liners so cost-efficient
yet very very creamy they're very
similar to the urban decay ones honestly
like truly so pigmented so creamy I'm
like how you're $5 or making ones or 20
I don't I don't understand it doesn't
like comprehend in my mind how it's even
possible to get similar formulas and
then both be beat but once
cheapest luck in one's not cheap as
don't know I don't know so those have
been my favorite 4016 they're so good to
lick lipsticks for the entire year I've
been wearing non-stop you guys are gonna
probably guess it honestly like you guys
did it I'd be kind of disappointed candy
cane by Kylie cosmetics and a jeffree
star mannequin this one is like an old
school mannequin that doesn't have a
frigging thing on it
Geoffrey starts formula is probably one
of my favorite formulas of all time when
comes to liquid lipsticks honestly this
shade is so beat love is formula so
pigmented not drying such a nice nice
formula and then I also love Kylie
cosmetics in the shade Kandy K the
formula of this one is a little bit more
drying and by a little bit means
 drying is did okay cool so we
have Kandy K on this side a much more
pink red in under toned lipstick and
then we have mannequin on the side which
is a much more of a peachy pink
undertone as well but these are the
shades I love wearing like I wear them
literally all the time
mannequin and Ken DK you know you I love
the lipsticks are drugstore my favorite
two lipsticks for this entire year have
been the rimmel london kate lipstick in
the shade 45 and the maybelline blushing
beige lipstick in blushing beige I
didn't Larry decide that the Rimmel is
my second when I wear this so much it's
not even funny and I'm had blushing
beige which is a little bit more nude
right here Maybelline's lipsticks in
general are my favorite drugstore
lipsticks they're my number one like
diluted bolds the color sensational
then Matt's like they're so bomb
and I can't even believe that their
drugstore like I can't even get over it
that they're so good so if you guys are
looking for some nice new lipsticks from
the drugstore Rimmel London 45 or
blushing beige by Maybelline Phenom and
then last but not least a gloss product
or like a kind of like a gloss this is
the skinny dip by Zoe this is so tore up
I travel with this as well because I use
it all the time
so wearing on top of my lips right now
intense metallic glitter lip topper I
don't even know how to describe it I
don't know it's like the most intense
metallic gnarly as wet looking lip
gloss topper thing I like a matte
lipstick on in the petition I'm like
okay oh my god and I'm not gonna talk
about any morphe brushes you guys
already know morphe brushes like the
brushes are my favorite but I have
videos on them you know I mean like I
don't wanna waste your guys's time
talking about brushes that you guys know
I already love so that's why I didn't
talk about any brushes in today's video
I will link of course my favorite morphe
brushes videos down below but that's why
I didn't talk about any brushes in case

them so much I don't want to like waste
any of you guys a time this videos

first male Maybelline ambassador ever
