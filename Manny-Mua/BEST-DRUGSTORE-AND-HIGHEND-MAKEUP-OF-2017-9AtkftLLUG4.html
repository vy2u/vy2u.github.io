so today Oh finally I am so sorry that
this video coming to you guys so late
I've actually been sick I'm finally
barely getting over being sick today
actually and I don't feel the best still
and I'm sorry if I'm not gonna give you
as much energy as I usually can but I'm
still kind of getting over this cold /
fluid I had I don't really know what it
was I had fever had chills but it wasn't
like to an extreme level I had the flu
shot maybe that helped I'm sorry that
this best of 2017 video is coming at you
guys a little bit late but I still
wanted to do it I asked you guys on
Twitter and I did a poll and the
majority I said please continue to do it
and even though it's coming a little bit
late into the year to do the best on 17
and I have so many products here I
really want to jump right in because I
feel like it don't take so long for me
to do this because I have a lot of like
drugstore items I have a lot of like
higher-end items
/ like medium and items so now as we're
gonna be doing today you guys we're
gonna doing a fool best of beauty 2017 I
do not have any skincare in this video
because would like me to do a separate
video on skincare or if you want me to
do like a little like snapchat like
thing on skincare or Instagram or
something I can definitely do that for
you guys but I just figured it would
take way too long to glue skincare
because I feel like with skincare so as
I explained a lot more but anyway let's
go ahead and jump right into today's
video as always if you guys don't like
this video if you guys do not like me
please don't watch it you know
that you're with that whether you guys
do like this video please go ahead
subscribe to my channel if you're not
already and if we knew what's about mani
MUA and welcome to my channel thank you
so much for being here
I really really really appreciate it Bay
that's one get into this the best of
2017 beauty video okay let's jump right
in so I could do this face slash
complexion products right now and then I
do a little break and we're gonna do the
eye and brow products after that so
let's go and start off with each
category I'm gonna start off with
primers and I have a to Primus here that
I really really like this year I'm also
gonna go ahead and try my hardest to not
repeat products that I included in my
2016 best products that includes like
tart shaped tape which I have here I
haven't talked about that if you guys
have not seen that video I'll go ahead
leave it linked down below all those
products still apply I love them all so
much I saw you have used them all this
year as well anyway you guys I don't
talk about these two primers really
quickly that's going to start off with
the Bobbi Brown vitamin
rich skin base I'm obsessed with this I
literally think this is so amazing this
is like a beautiful moisturizing primer
that keeps you and I'm not saying that
keeps your makeup on a lot longer you
know I'm not saying that but when I do
use this I know something the makeup
looks so much more beautiful on the face
after you do this because it's so so so
hydrating and it really just gives my
face this really beautiful suppleness
that I can't even explain and a little
bit goes a long way I literally just dip
my Beauty Blender into it and I've been
using it all year and I barely use any
of it like it's crazy it's amazing I
highly recommend it another primer I
really really like which is almost
similar to the Bobbi Brown one is the
Too Faced hangover RX replenishing face
primer I've been using this all year I
 love it it's one of those that's
a very very hydrating one and it just
makes your skin plump and supple it
isn't really filling your pores
last year I'm talking about pore
fessional from benefit which was amazing
that's like what I always always always
use still to do my little t-zone but for
all the over the face I like to use the
Bobbi Brown or the hangover RX from Too
Faced because I feel like it really
gives the foundation some life I highly
recommend I think they're amazing I
don't really have a drugstore primer
that I use very often so if you guys
have any drugstore primaries that you
guys recommend I would love to get to
comment down below because I don't have
any for myself so it's kind of annoying
anyway it's gonna move on to some
foundations I have three aunts to talk
about first and foremost my most used
foundation of all is the hourglass
banners stick foundation this is my
favorite foundation of the entire year
it swept me away it gives a beautiful
amount of coverage it looks beautiful on
the skin it's buildable and then
realized I'm getting beautiful and I
cannot explain it I always I literally
use this every day I'm using this today
it makes what's under foundation but I
always use this with my base foundation
because it gives me all my coverage and
it's stunning and it plays well with
others you know I'm saying you need a
foundation sometimes that plays well
with others and this one does I've gone
through it this is like my third stick
that I've gone through bitch I live like
literally I would like I can like plow
another stick randomly like I love this
so drugstore one that I've been loving
in this entire year that I used so often
was the Maybelline matte and poreless
foundation why was i sleeping on mainly
men for lists like I don't understand
I'm booking this is such a beautiful
foundation
it does say matte and poreless but to me
it doesn't really give you a matte matte
finish it gives you like a satin matte
finish it still gives you a really
pretty Sheen to the skin I think it's
stunning it's a medium coverage
buildable cover
as well and for the drugstore price like
it really really cannot be beaten and I
just love it also shout-out to Loreal
Pro Matt infallible I love that
foundation a lot this year as well but
this one for me took the cake for a
drugstore as you can see like I use it a
lot it's up it's there man and so
I'm for my last foundation I have not
been using this foundation for a long
time I've only been using for the past
two months but honestly you guys I have
to include it and it deserves this
shoutout a dice this is the NARS natural
radiant long wear foundation I did a
video with NARS a little bit while back
talking about this foundation and it is
so beautiful maybe I've been
using it for a month not two months mmm
it's just the most beautiful foundation
I've had here I'm actually wearing it
today so I have a stick of hourglass
like a boom boom boom boom and then I
have this on top to blend with hourglass
and I just honestly feel like my skin
looks Iranian and beautiful and
it's set with powder and I just think it
gives you the most beautiful amount of
coverage and lasts nicely on my skin
when you set it with powder it's very
important because this is more of a
luminous foundation it's definitely more
on the dewy side I would highly suggest
setting this with powder because it will
move on the skin if you do not if you're
oily I'm telling you you will want to
set this foundation but honestly when
you said it it stays on beautifully it
looks beautiful on the skin I'm looking
at the at the monitor I mean out W
finder to make sure I'm in focus I
always catch myself looking at my skin
and I'm like oh I'm sorry whose skin is
that highly recommend ten out of ten
NARS natural radiant long wear I've been
only using for the month and it's
already my best 2017 that's what I'm
saying
it's that good I use it all the time
let's go and talk about some concealer
so I have to just talk about this even
though I talked to our last year
heart-shaped aimed I thought this is the
bitch that took the world by storm the
beauty world by storm
I literally noticed like this one this
bottle is like empty like it's
scratched on the side that's like I'm
like I've gone through like four or five
of these at this point I just think such
a beautiful concealer it gives you a
full amount of coverage I love that
obviously it's like the I like the
consistency of it it's almost like a
whipped liquid it's not too liquidy but
it's not too whipped either I just
really really really like it it doesn't
settle into my fine lines really fast
and I'm wearing it today and I love it
and the other concealer I loved it for
this year is the NARS
soft matte pot this is my second one and
she's going through it
she is going through it this pot you
guys this is like the the concealer
that I'm like discovered this year where
I was like oh my word it's such a
beautiful consistency the coverage is
fullest but it doesn't settle into your
fine lines fast or anything like that
either you said it it looks perfect the
entire day and I love that it's a little
pot you get a little brush it's perfect
it's stunning and I love it so much
these are the only so every is all year
I wore these consist have Lang sometimes
together if I'm feeling zesting to
powders I used non stop this year I'm
really trying to blow through this thing
but I already know it's gonna be so
 long so I'm trying to like not
explain too much about each product you
know what I mean so I'm sure you guys
have seen me use all these products on
my channel I tried to do a little
end-of-the-year recap you know last year
of course I talked about like Laura
Mercier translucent powder RC made no
color powder I'm not gonna include those
this year I wanted to include two new
ones I want to talk about the Too Faced
Born This Way ethereal powder this is
like the powder of the year for me like
that's the powder I'm wearing today
this powder it is so good it is so
good it's beautiful on the skin it blurs
the pores it makes everything just look
look at me it makes everything just
looks so snatched and if you're dry I
feel like it's not gonna pull at your
dry patches whatsoever it's not a drying
powder whatsoever but if you're oily it
does keep your oils at bay very very
nicely you can bake with this powder it
just looks really really good on camera
and in photography it doesn't flash back
and the other powder I want to talk
about is the Charlotte Tilbury airbrush
flawless finish powder this is the guy
right here so what she looks like it's
like a little airbrush powder this
powder you guys oh it feels like silk it
feels like silk and it looks like silk
on the skin this powder is like my holy
grail powder I will use it to set my
under eye I'll use it to set my face if
I'm just not if I'm not in the mood to
use this one I use this one because it's
so beautiful on the skin and it's so
lightweight and like honestly like the
more I apply this one it never gets
cakey on me like I literally will keep
applying like three layers of it
throughout the day never looking cakey
whatsoever because it's such a finely
milled soft powder and I highly
recommend it okay guys let's go and talk
about some bronzers the bronzer from the
drugstore that I literally slate my
whole existence Physicians Formula
Muhtar bronzer oh my god just open and
smelled it again oh my gosh how do you
do this oh my god dude only smells like
it was like crumb doughnuts from
the 7-eleven you know those doughnuts I
feel like an orange you with flakes on
them it smells like that technically
it's like a coconut like cement cement
smell and scent
Clocky right now technically it's like a
coconut scent but it smells so good and
it gives such a beautiful finish on the
skin I really have no complaints about
this bronzer I think it's amazing I
can't believe that this is like a
drugstore bronzer it looks beautiful the
shade I use is in bronze bronzer it's
not a shade technically I think it's
like the medium shade it's not too warm
it's not too cool it gives you a nice
bronze ass look and it's from the
drugstore like I really
it's a Fritz brunet I can't complain
okay guys so now a high-end bronzer that
I literally use every single time to my
makeup I'm not kidding you every single
time
Marc Jacobs tantrik you guys have seen
me use this so much the rest
when I had shattered that was
devastating because this bitch was like
limited-edition as and I'm really
hoping that they bring this back because
honestly the color is stunning and
there's so much product in here like I
feel like I've used this all year and
I'm not even hit pan yet and I use it
every single day so I don't understand
no one can know how it works but it
honestly is so beautiful the formulation
is stunning highly recommend it summit
edition hopefully they get bring it back
but I don't new last and final like
bronze retype item at 417 is the Urban
Decay Naked skin at shapeshifter palette
anyway I use a shade liked to medium and
this is the shape sort of palette so
what it is it's like you get four
powders I use them a lot I like thank
them and you get like five creams in
here it's called shapeshifter because it
is a contour and highlighting palette
you get your little powders if you're
not into using creams you get to use
creams if you're not into powders I love
that I use it all the time
I always use these two shades
specifically this is a very very very
cool toned Brown if you're a little bit
darker than me I probably wouldn't even
recommend it because it is gonna look
really I fee like it'll look a little
bit ashy on darker complexion but it has
a nice warmer tone over here it comes
with one little highlight I never
touched this I should and I do like to
use at these two guys right here to
brighten up my under-eye or contour with
creams so honestly I use this all the
time
take with me when I travel that's what I
know I use something very frequently if
I'm traveling with you bitch I am using
you so I highly recommend that and I
think it's great for us perceive like if
you wanted to throw in your kid there's
a medium to dark one as well I just
things really really really practical
let's go and move on to highlighters now
drugstore highlighters first it's one
talked about the main two the only two
that mattered for me right here
Maybelline master chrome bitch the
Maybelline master chrome and molten gold
are you joking this like Slade my whole
visa ready yeah I don't know how they
didn't even guy you think it's so huh
stunning it's like what I think it's
like ten bucks but truly you guys I'm
not kidding you this highlighter acts
like it's a high-end highlighter it's so
nice I will literally use it when I'm
like going out to an event like I don't
even care like it's not like oh it's not
high in high light who gives a it's
literally so nice and so beautiful I'm
obsessed I love it and then I
also really really really really loved
the wet'n wild highlighting powders base
laid with these highly parts I came up
with a slew of them a slew look bitch
like that's the hone right here second
one right there boom this is in the
shade golden flower crown this is like
even cheaper than the other one things
are like 4 bucks like it's crazy these
are really really really nice and
they're very very very affordable it
literally like is high-end to me even
though it's out of the drugstore they're
 bomb okay it's go and talk about
hey let's talk about cream one I used to
use this like Larry all the time I don't
use as much anymore but I use this all
year long this is the Marc Jacobs
dewdrops do you guys remember this when
this came out these are the dewdrops and
these were literally so poppin I Larry
will take the smallest amount like a
little dollop we do that no daughter
Cordell piece of coming out yeah
the tiniest amount would take my Beauty
Blender and I would pat pat pat on my
cheekbones and like on areas I would
want to highlight it's stunning it just
gives a beautiful golden shift and it
would really really intensify highlight
if I was using a highlighter that I
really wanted to like being from the
 ground to the sky I don't know
if they still sell them or not but 10
out of 10 recommend next time I won't
talk about this is the nikkietutorials
Expo for collaboration in the shade glow
goals this highlight are you guys I'm
actually wearing it as a topper today
like slayed me slayed me to the
ground third one okay now I'm getting
crazy oh man my hand looking crazy I'm
not even if I can swatch it it's amazing
the only problem with this Highlander I
would say or with honestly any Oprah
highlighter is that they're so soft that
they're really really crumbly like I
literally like have pieces falling apart
because they're so delicate which are
noise the out of me I wish that
they were pressed a little bit harder
Nicki and Oprah killed the highlighters
that they came out with Vicki she came
up with three logos is my absolute
favorite and I love it and last but not
least I want to talk about really
quickly is the Anasazi aglow kit
specifically this one this is the that
glow glow kit and I want to talk about
also Nicole Guerrero's collab with an
associate as well which was literally
the most beautiful last collaboration
can't find in my drawers anywhere I
don't where the that bitch went
honestly that collab that palette was so
stunning I want to talk about it because
it's gonna make me but here you know
it's literally was just so good
and I just loved it so much they killed
it so this is the that glow kit I have
used these three didn't really use that
one that much don't know where I would
use it for other than a shadow it
doesn't really go with my complexion but
honestly I love Donna siglo kits I think
that they come out with such an amazing
array of glow kits this year and I would
highly recommend getting a glow kit from
an associate and just slang with it
because it's so pretty now we're gonna
move on to some blushes and then we'll
go on to like eye stuff or whatever
so now blushes I have three blush price
I want to talk about for this year
number one blush product of the year for
me hands down my obsession is the Tarte
blush Bazaar this bitch right here you
guys that no not ten ten and it's so
compact it's perfect I travel with it
everywhere I go this is all I wear this
I'm wearing as my blush today this is
what I'm wearing fortunate honestly you
guys I just feel like this was such a
practical thing on up to I came out with
I think this is like retails for 40
bucks
I was shocked at how cost-efficient this
was came with ten blushes great size
product great amount you got any I'll
just like bitch like it was amazing I
want to talk about this blush real quick
the height literally always always
always wear from the drugstore this is
the wet and wild color icon and blush
and pearlescent pink hi
faith in this shade for a long
time oh just give me a little a little
touch high but honestly this is like
three dollars and it was and it's just
beautiful it's the most beautiful soft
pink blush a complement so many
different skin tones it blends so nicely
I kind of like I can't anything else
good about it like it's just that good
there's so much product and I'm like
bitch I have no complaint that's great
and then the last question I'm talking
about is my district list this is from
their Mint collection this is in the
shade amazement and it's the most
perfect apricot peach blush ever and on
the skin it's so beautiful I
travel with this one too I travel with
these three these are the three blush
products that you honestly shouldn't and
it's too much it's already crazy what I
do and I love all three of them and
those I would highly recommend for
blushes if you guys are blush people you
will be obsessed with all three of these
have too many I only have two brow
products I loved it this year last year
talking about the of course on assessing
brow Wiz and I think I even talked about
a definer I love dipping in the rain
this year been picking out with a slew
of brow products that came out to hold
her range which was absolutely amazing
they came out with so many I
specifically love it there precisely
brow pencil I just love this one because
honestly it is so pigmented you could do
like the easiest like little hair like
strokes with it like it's so easy to use
and it's pigmented it's not too waxy
where you feel like it's like gonna come
off super super easily I thought that's
very very like transfer resistant and
they had a great color range I just
really really liked them so and the brow
gel I always always always use is the
anastacio tinted brow gel and the shade
granite or espresso it just kind of
depends how I'm feeling I didn't today
actually it's going to use that well
honestly you guys this brow gel I love
it so much because I feel like you
really use my brows in place it gives me
a little bit of color not too much where
I'm like bitch that's like too much but
I just like it really tames the brow you
know and it keeps them in place and they
do not budge this is like some
gorilla glue like this don't budge
and I love it for it like I don't want
my brows to budge I want them to stay
put the ten hours I have the makeup on
these are the brow products that I have
been loving all year long and they
our staples in my collection and I
travel with them constantly oh you want
to drop again so it's going to move on
to V here we're talking about some eye
products I don't talk about pallets I
like to have only three so it's not like
anything crazy so the eye products that
stole my heart this year are these guys
right here these are the glitter and
glow and shimmer and glow shadows by
Stila you guys you guys already know how
I feel about these these are literally
the best thing that happened this year
to me like their number who maintain
this is the glittering glow shadows
which I use consistently oh my word oh
and they dry to a like drier finish so
they don't like transfer on you and at
the shimmering glow shadows which they
were just released or recently right
here you guys I don't know what else to
say about these I have not said already
I've said a million times how
amazing these are like other brands have
tried to recreate products like this
they turn out to be a flop they're too
sticky things like that these right out
perfectly
these look stunning on the eye they just
look great they're bomb and then I also
really want on weather this week with
this is a super shock shadow in the
shade rich this is actually color pop
and Laura Lee collaborated they did a
thing for no-kill LA which is so amazing
they did a collaboration together and
all the proceeds went to a no-kill early
and Laura came out with this shade
called Ritz and it's the prettiest
 shade it's literally just
glitter it's like an easy way of using
glitter without it being too intense and
too scary like literally right here
that's like a glittery beautiful shade
right there you see it actually a little
bit on my eyes just pressed unlike the
inner part of my eye just a little like
and I think that Laura did an amazing
job
I think club pop did an amazing job and
I think really honestly clever I've just
had an amazing year in general they
 slayed it in 2017 so the palette
that like ended up hots for me in 2007
pain is the Jaclyn hill palette this is
the palette I used the most often this
one is not the one I use this is a newer
one that I actually just used recently
because my I get my other one to my mom
because she really loved it so I'm like
okay mom it's fine honestly the giacomo
palette was one of my favorite palettes
of the entire year
if not my ax will play my palette the
entire year because I feel like it's the
most practical it's the one I traveled
with the most as one the easiest to
bring around me also traveled of course
with my modern Renaissance by talking
about that last year I loved it the
palette and I just think it's really
really great
anything more he really sensitive this
year two more fees another brand in
general that really really took off in
2017 which makes me so happy because
I've been with the brand for like three
and a half years now for a long time and
I've been really behind them since the
beginning so seeing them do so well for
themselves makes me really really happy
and I just think that Jacqueline and
more if you came out with this beautiful
beautiful palette
there's no denying how nice it is it has
everything you could really really need
at all the transitions you need it's got
everything so I loved that ballad so
much also my last pie wanna talk about
this wasn't one I used like so so so
much but it's one I use so often I had
to bring it this is the Kylie Jenner
Kylie cosmetics nice palette and this is
what it looks like inside you guys this
color scheme to me was literally
everything I was living like I was
living breathing gagging dying gasping I
loved it so much I thought was such a
beautiful palette and the colors were so
nice they were so blendable they were so
pigmented and I'm just like Kylie really
stepped it up with her eye shadows to
Kylie's another brand that just
killed in 2017 so congrats to all these
brands just slaying the game and
it's really really cool to see and it's
very inspiring and it helps inspiring me
too because i'm course coming out with
my own brand it doesn't eighteen so I'm
very very very excited for that to
happen and it's just really cool cuz I
feel like very inspired by the beauty
community in general so those pallets
and those eye products were some that I
loved it so much in 2000 and and the
lashes that stole the show for me in
2017 were Lily lashes Miami these are
the pairs that I wear the most often
actually not wearing them today for some
shocking reason I'm wearing Makino's you
will always catch me in the
Miami
other than today but honestly I just
feel like this lash killed it for me and
it was the most beautiful Ashe look at
it it's just so stunning oh my god well
I honestly I put it on everyone like if
I'm doing someone's makeup if I'm doing
a collab or something I always want to
put Miami on first and they're like no
they're too dramatic I'll like go to a
less dramatic one but I always just go
to Miami first cuz I feel like it makes
everyone's eyes look so big and bright
and intense and they're not as subtle
lash or definitely more of a dramatic
lash but I'm a dramatic kind of girl and
I lived for them so Lily lashes Miami
highly recommend okay so now we're gonna
go and move on to the lip products and
we will be done with today's video oh
sorry it's probably like it's probably a
long one I
I tried to go as quick as I could penny
was gonna talk about some liquid
lipsticks of the year that I was living
for this one is from the drugstore this
is V wet'n wild liquid catsuit megalast
liquid lipsticks these are $5
wet and wild
killed it they killed it in 2017 I
couldn't even believe how well they did
with how many products came out with how
nice the products were I'm like if they
can do it for $5 why can't some of the
higher end brands not do it for 50 mm
anyway I thought that these liquid
lipsticks were so phenomenal for $5 I'd
really think that you couldn't beat the
price point and I want to bring them up
because even though I don't wear them as
often I feel like they deserve so much
credit and I think they just did an
amazing amazing job with the liquid
lipsticks I'm like wow and while and
then cruelty free a little bunny also
another leg lipstick I wanna talk about
it so I drugstore brand but it is a
lower like lower price item these are
the morphe liquid lipsticks morphe
liquid lipsticks killed this year they
came out with liquid lipsticks this year
recently like they are so nice and I
think they retail for like $10 and you
use a discount code on them like it's
literally so nice they're on the more
like moosie frothy side which I really
like I want some wave or
something here you know I want some like
product I don't want to be too liquidy
too thin they're like kinda weirds me
out and if like it gets everywhere I
don't know why I like formulas I'm a bit
more than a thicker side so morphe
killed their liquid lipsticks but the
liquid lipsticks that ended on liquid
lipsticks for me in 2017 work from
Smashbox I don't know if Smashbox had
liquid lipsticks in 2016 but doesn't
seventeen I really started to use them a
lot more and honestly this formula is so
good like I just don't have any words
like I just don't do it like they're so
nice that book hair is super cute I love
I can do a little sharp point
I loved Smashbox liquid lipsticks
they're so comfortable they're full
coverage they last very nicely on the
lips they don't dry down too intensely
where it's like hurting you but they do
last so long so honestly these three
liquid lipsticks were the ones that like
stole the show for me in 2017 and to
gloss type items I want to talk about
are one from colour-pop I don't like a
mulcher glossy lips this year I have no
idea but I think they did an amazing job
with ultra glossy lips I think that
there
beautiful thing they feel amazing this
one is in the shade a moon child and
this is the one that they did with
Kathleen lights she did collaboration
with them they came out with three lip
products and a palette but moonchild is
the gloss color that literally stole my
 heart my Reda was gone right
there that color glass are you joking
it's everything it's literally
everything I wear it all the time but
they have a ton of varieties that I also
really like this one from the Laura Lee
collection this one is in the shade Wham
and this is literally just like glittery
gloss no swatch it mixes - this one
right here it's a glittery pretty gloss
and honestly these are like six bucks
I'm like normal and last product I
talked about which I lived for this
entire year are the Kylie cosmetics Kim
K West cream liquid lipsticks bitch
these were on my lips when they came out
consistently so much they were the most
comfortable ass lipsticks they didn't
last very long on the lips of course
they didn't dry down matte they'd even
dried down like their satin ones did
they were just a really pretty cream
lipstick in a liquid form
they were stunning they felt amazing on
the lips the colors were beautiful the
arrangement this is in the shade Kiki my
favorite one was Kimberly I wear all the
time I lost it because I wore it so
often and I lost track of it yeah
knowing this bitch we are really
honest because I love that color so much
anyways you guys that is it for today's
that video I feel like I'm already like
so many minutes in I apologize if this
is a long video hope you guys grabbed a
snack
grab your man grab me I'm not
gonna say that I want to stay water
tight but anyways you guys thank you so
much for requesting this video I had so
much fun filming it for you guys I hope
you guys enjoyed it I loved it doing
these end of the year 2017 favorites
videos like they're really really
important I feel like it's really cool
to be able to recap on the entire year
previously and see some of the best
products that came out in the year and
just give credit to brands and different
collaborations and different people that
came out with beautiful products
throughout the entire year and it's just
really really cool to see how far the
beauty community is going and is coming
and I hope that 2018 brings amazing
experiences for you guys for me for
other people in the beauty industry you
know I hope there's so many more changes
happening in the beauty industry after
this more diversity shown in the beauty
community up is more shade ranges
released in different brands I hope that
there's more diversity when it comes to
male and
female being shown in campaigns men and
women instead of just only being women
in campaigns and things like that or
only being lighter complexions in
campaigns not darker complexions so I
really hope that chosen 18 brings just
more diversity and I think we're getting
there I feel like we're really gonna get
there this year where it's just gonna be
a big clusterfuck of everyone in the
community being represented the way they
want to be represented you know and I'm
really excited about it and I cannot
wait and I cannot wait to see which has
an 18 that brings for us and brings for
me brings for lunar beauty I'm so
excited about my first product to launch
hopefully it's unbecoming out and like
mayor Jun that's like the goal time so
