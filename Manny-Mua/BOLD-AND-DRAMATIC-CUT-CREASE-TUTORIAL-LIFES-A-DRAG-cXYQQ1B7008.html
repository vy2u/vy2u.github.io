today's video is going to be another
tutorial and yes I know tutorials are
not as fun nowadays YouTube about a year
ago they'd be like fuck yeah tutorials
now it's like fuck no but anyway I
wanted to do another tutorial on my
palette out of course life's a drag this
me heat that right here
in my last video I did a more natural
ish look you know I did like the maroon
the gold and a pop of purple but say I
want to do a little bit more something
on the bold side I just kind of showed
you guys the versatility of the palette
because it is so versatile very very
very versed just like me and I just
wanted to show you guys how it is and
how to use it and just like a little bit
more on the dramatic sax I know a lot of
you guys do love dramatic makeup but all
of you guys do really like natural
makeup too so i'm gonna be definitely
incorporating maybe the next video or
the next like something I'll use my
palette to form more of a natural look
just so you guys can see how versatile
it really is I'm so happy you guys are
excited for I mean all myself those are
like booming and so stoked for the
palette so I'm very very very excited
about that but anyway let's go ahead and
get right into this so recently I've
been seeing as a trend that people are
really really living their best fantasy
for the eye that's like two colors with
like a color on the Santa Clara on this
side which I live for I mean that's
actually been going on for fuckin years
and years and years now but I feel like
it's been a little bit more popular
recently which I live for so first
things first we're gonna do one eye
purple pink and the other eyes enemy
blue so I'm gonna go in with Chi Chi and
pageant queen I just dipped right in to
the brush again this is and four three
three I can eat a fucking tail honestly
I rubbed it off I'm gonna take my mirre
she's normal I just got back from Japan
recently it was such a fucking amazing
trip and nikita got this for me when she
was in japan a week before me yeah I
wanna go right in we're gonna go in with
this pink purple combination fuchsia do
you see this fucking pigmentation I'm so
happy with how everything's turned out
and I'm so happy to see everyone's
feedback and so it's so cool to also see
people like doing full-on like reviews
now and people have it in their hands
now and like the people that I got it in
PR they're getting it and it's like
they're gonna use it like it's just such
an intense crazy thing to me that people
are actually getting in their hands I
don't that makes any sense I'm not gonna
have a bitch where I'm like the bitch is
perfect it's fuckin flawless like I
don't think that I just think that I did
the best that I could and I hope that
just my next products I
do even better and seeing people's
reaction of seeing people's reviews and
seeing other people's opinions
it's what's really really really gonna
help me do that and so I'm really really
excited and I can't wait to see you guys
actually wearing it as well because I
made this fella for y'all can't wait to
post you guys on my fucking Instagram
and the whole thing it's been a fucking
crazy fucking day it's been a crazy week
very crazy week actually it's been very
very very stressful you know I just
didn't know it was gonna be this intense
of a week like it just been it's just
been hard like I was prepared in a way
but I also wasn't at the same time it's
just really scary to come out with
something and people still debasht it of
course you know I know not everyone's
gonna love it and you can't that but
it's so that little stress of like but
it's my baby can you not be so mean
that's kind of how I've been feeling but
it's been great it's been a wonderful
I'm building up chi Chi and pageant
queen that's what I'm doing right now
mostly the pageant queens a little bit
of Chi Chi blended in and that's kind of
what she looks like right there just
stun of course she's done I'm just kind
of blending her own these bright Co
thought they're good anyway yeah that's
not like the tea that's just kind of
going on with me you have just been
really going through it for the launcher
just making sure everything is going
well anyway yeah you guys how have you
all been
are you guys excited for it I can't wait
for you guys to be able to get it in
your hands and actually like use it and
play with it for yourself and see how
awesome it is I just feel like there's
like a lot of comments on going around
circulating about everything about that
the palette about the brand the whole
nine like I said in my last video and if
you guys have seen the last one we might
reveal video which I'll link down below
is that I created this palette because I
wanted to pay homage to drag cuz I did
drag first starting my youtube guess
Mannie my way like life my career so
that's always called life to drag is cuz
drag started my life as man um you a
it's like a play on words I know I like
kind of is really random and weird and I
know people are saying that I'm not a
drag queen and I know I know I'm not a
drag queen bids I just fucking heart
I've done it several times oh my god I'm
gonna leave photos from me and drag on
the screen so he hasn't see from back in
the day like maybe like six years ago
before I was made in anyway now I'm
gonna take the shade Kiki on a more feet
m5 before I'm gonna use that into the
crease as I said you guys this color is
definitely more of a transition shade
it's like more buildable it's not like
one of those shades that's like damn
she's fucking diamonds and it's
definitely not like that I mean you can
take a lot and you can build it of
course but it's not like one of the most
taking two chains in the palette that's
for sure I just wanna be honest with you
guys I wanted to use this more as a
transition you type shade yeah just
you're aware this is we're all on the
same page here drag was super fun and
that's like what jump-started it all for
me seeing dry cleans and
whole thing I was like fuck this is
everything dicking kick face by the way
it was such a rush doing it being in
drag just seeing people's reactions and
seeing what they thought of me in drag
and seeing like old friends in school
being very like my god what the fuck
you're like really pretty and I'm like
no right now taking the shade fishy on a
r39 I think and you all want to scream
do you want to know my fucking dragon
name was it was Madison and I would
always just go by Madison first but
technically the first part was Clarice
Clarice I know I know y'all thinkin
thinkin what the flying fuck was that
why did you name yourself
Clarice Madison and I honestly did not
really know much about naming myself in
drag but I just used my first pet which
was her name was Clarice and she was a
cat and she was the best thing in the
world and the street that I lived on
which was Madison and I just combined
them to do Clarice Madison technically
it's more so Madison and Clarice is just
what I'm feeling dirty when I was
feeling more frisky back in the day you
know what I never thought cuz I'm just
like old life like that was such a
different time for me it's when like my
parents caught me up on fucking social
media and they're like oh you're doing
drag you want to become a woman you know
they had no idea what jog even was eight
and they did not understand they didn't
get it and they understand I want it was
just my creative outlet they were just
so shook by the whole thing
I'm just really lucky to be at the place
I am now because took a long time to get
there but we got here and now have this
looking palette that my parents were so
involved in you guys I wish I could even
understand how bald my parents are with
this my dad is like my business guy he
like fill us stuff with the lawyers and
he does like everything with dad my mom
she helps me so much with my everything
else like testing product letting me
like you stuff on her she helps me so
much I'm like really really lucky by the
way I'm taking color pop concealer I
could not have done this without them
there's no way in fucking hell I'm just
feeling on cloud nine like I just feel
really happy really blessed just really
excited for the new adventure you know
I'm already so excited for my next
product that I'm working on by the way
taking for a movie m42 one that white
can see there from colour-pop
I love that concealer for white just
everything I'm cutting the crease it's
gonna be a half cut crease by the way
like so I'm gonna do other side as well
probably need to be a little bit more
delicate with like it's a little bit
more of like a I just breathe breathe it
through slowly cut above the crease for
me I have hooded lids if I'm opening my
eyes like to go right above the fold and
we're going to set that with cake face
which is my white my stomach
gorgeous beautiful white shade take kick
face nice hefty amount I'm gonna set
that concealer so doesn't crease on us
so be careful so you don't like go past
the lines at all and take this on a
morphe M 210 there's a great packing
brush to pack on shadow especially cuz
it's more of a natural bristle it picks
up powder really really nicely I see I
see and then we take that same brush I
became a pageant queen and kike I mix
them together and just go right where it
meets so we need to have a nice seamless
blend like so you just want a natural
flush just a natural stunning little
moment but anyway this is what the look
looks like on this side I'm add a little
bit of black actually as well just a
hair I'll show you just intensify the
color out here a little bit more just a
little bit on this outer V moment and
I'm just going back in with that same
brush I was using earlier the n43 and
I'm just gonna go ahead and lightly
blend shady in with the rest of the
shades making sure that the brush is
always tilted upward so that you can
blend outwards to the other side off of
camera the same exact thing and I'll be
right back so now we have the tops of
the eye basically done of course I'm
gonna add some eyeliner because I feel
like eyeliner always pull this look in
together I'm gonna take any black
eyeliner any black eyeliner works just
great and I'm gonna run that on both
lash lines and I'm gonna be using the
exact opposite color story so with that
so I'm gonna go like this taking the
black this one is a Maybelline one I'm
just blending out that black before it
sets
as such that would do the same in the
opposite side so now we have the black
underneath I'm gonna go ahead and apply
the blue and the purple on the opposite
end we will see how this looks
honestly this is a great idea but fuck I
don't know if I want to do it I want to
just keep it like this blue and purple
what should I do you guys like this look
is so pretty right now I don't want to
ruin it with like going opposite there's
a fucking go for it and just be
different be unique and be the queen
that I am on the inside
absolutely I did it oh my gosh we did it
I did I did I did it okay guys or taking
fishy or playing that over the black I'm
really just pressing that over I don't
know if I love it I just don't think I
live so I think I'm just gonna keep it
the color story opposite opposite and
take off the blue I just don't live
I just don't live a thousand live you
know what's good okay I have to blend
like my life depends on it can't just
wipe this off after mm-hmm this height
looks a little fucked up it's all good
we're gonna go and apply the shadows and
hopefully everything will look decent
because that black gel liner really
really do me in on that
okay taking fishy and applying it over
the black on this side and I'm just
pressing hard so it really sinks into
the black and helps me blend out that
black when you're on out ooh I like her
he's being a good girl
I'm just lightly blending around it a
little bit of key key as well that's
fucking sickening okay now I'm gonna go
in with pageant queen on the opposite
side and do the exact same thing one
take this pretty low so this end up
going down farther on this side the know
as opposed to but your dance why did I
enter dance I'm not perfect let me do a
little bit of concealer on those edges a
bit yeah just a hair
okay cool guys so now I'm gonna go ahead
and put some eyeliner and lashes off of
camera it'll be right yep yesterday oh
my god you guys yesterday I was in my
room and I had shit so bad I told it
over if he kept going as slow as he was
because he was going underneath the
speed limit that I was gonna shit in his
car and he sped up the end okay guys and
that is it this is the final look I
added some lashes I put some uh Lily
lashes Miami on and some winged liner I
feel like with the winged liner in
shit just ties it all together and makes
it look so much a more cohesive I added
a little bit of beat in the inner corner
as well just to add a little bit of a
shimmer to it and this is what we have I
wanted to do something really really
bold and fun for my second tutorial
using this palette just kind of wanted
to show you guys the versatility of the
palette because it is so easy to go so
bold but it also goes so neutral as well
I mean honestly look at these shades
like beet and legendary it's a sick joke
it's sick the fucking bad so fucking
good anyways you guys this videos gonna
be going up after my palette goes light
so I just want to say thank you to
everyone that has purchased the palette
and have supported me and all I ever
wanted to do is provide you guys with
amazing high-quality products that you
guys will actually really really really
enjoy that's why I created a brand I
don't want it just to be you guys
spending money on random ass brands so
you know nothing about that don't have
your best just a heart that just want to
earn money from you I feel like the cool
thing about influencers coming out with
brands is that they really do have the
consumers best interests at heart
because they were first consumers as
well I bought makeup for the past 5
years you know and I've used makeup very
frequently for the past 5 years and I
feel like I've know what I like at this
point and I know what kind of products
work really really well and that's what
I like about influencer products because
I feel like a lot of times they know
what they're doing they know what kind
of products they want to put out there
and they know about quality and so
that's kind of what I wanted with my
brand just to have beautiful high
quality products and that is that that's
it for today's video you guys hope you
guys had fun watching couple guys
enjoyed this tutorial just kind of doing
something different a little bit more
fun and a little more fresh on the eye a
little bit of purple and blue action I
love you guys so much okay so the night
or day wherever you guys are and I will
catch you guys in my next video
bye I love you and of course I'll leave
my pal links down below and my website
