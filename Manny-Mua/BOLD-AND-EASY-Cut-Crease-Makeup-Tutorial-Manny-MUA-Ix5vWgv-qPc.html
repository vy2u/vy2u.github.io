just really really love this look it's
so easy to do it's really not that hard
I swear to you it's not that hard one
palette only Modern Renaissance and you
can quickly dis look it's so freakin
easy and I actually wore this when I

how'd you guys do like this video please
subscribe to my channel if you are not
already and give it a like if you guys
want to thank you like it right now go
okay let's go and get into this eye
tutorial on this cut crease so I had so
many requests to do this tutorial and so
I figured I'm just gonna film it because
it is a really really fun and not so
hard I look let's film this I
already have my base on so I'm just
gonna really focus on the eyelid today
so we're gonna go in with the Anastacio
modern a renaissance palette and that's
what I've been using on my eyes
recreated to a tee I'm hoping I mean
like baking a cake you're never gonna
bake it the exact same twice you're
never just same makeup exactly twice so
I'm just gonna do what I can do and
we're gonna do it with this okay my eyes
are already pardoned by the way and I
wanted to zoom in as much as I possibly
could without it being too severe
okay so first thing stars we're gonna go
in with the shade burnt orange and a
little bit of golden ochre and I'm
trying to literally dab into both of
them dab into book to them and we're
gonna do a very light amount ice and we
put that into the crease with a more
5027 a fluffy brush will work best fish
and we're gonna really try to avoid the
lid at all costs right now because the
focus is going to be into the crease
keeping your eyes open like you can see
color there make sure you're focusing
all the color on the top of your crease
or in your crease if you have a better
crease than me because I have like all
this little extra skin here
to go above my crease then you're good
but if you don't if you have like hooded
lids like me or just a little extra skin
like me not down there then you should
be good these shadows blend so well oh I
love the Marvin asan's products not even
funny
we're going to go into raw Sienna and
mix in a little bit of red ochre and
that's not going to outer corner and
then go a little bit lower than what we
have the first original shades down
first so we'll put that in the outer
corner into the crease about halfway
into the crease really trying to avoid
the lid because that's what we're going
to go kind of start cutting in so
majority of the color on the outer
corner and into the crease and a little
bit in here just a little nugget and
then blend it out with a 27 just make
sure we get some a nice smooth
transition now as you can see there's
like layering of colors a little bit
darker a little deeper then this side
you can see there's more dimension okay
cool so now that we have those colors
deposited as you can see now we're going
to take a little bit of Venetian red
mixing that really bright like plumage
color fuchsia with Cypress number which
is a really dark deep brown and that's
one go on the most outer corner of our
eye I'm going to take that with a morphe
36 and this is going to just really pack
on that color as well as place exactly
where I wanted to be placed lower than
the last shades see right there that
looks deep as deeper than the
 alien and now I want to take
that M 4-3-3 and blend that out slightly
okay go so now for the fun slash a
little bit harder aspect of this look
it's not hard I promise you it's not
hard as long as you're like really just
concentrating focusing it's not going to
be hard
but this is the part that is like the
main part of this look you know I'm
saying so we're gonna take a concealer
and you can see it works great my
favorite personally is the mac
prolongwear for the eyes because the
eyes on me get kinda greasy and oily
when they're not prime they're always
priming but I'm just saying they do and
this one keeps the oils that bay a
little bit as well so what we're gonna
do is we're take a small tiny synthetic
flat brush as you can see this brush
right here is so synthetic and flat like
his halo flat like my chance and
we're gonna use this to cut out and
carve out the crease and we're gonna
take literally like a drop of the mac
prolongwear we're gonna really saturate
the brush on both sides I can show you
don't have too much on the brush itself
so what we gonna do is we take that
brush now we're gonna start I mean I
could kind of pull my I taught a little
bit more stuff the beginning of our eye
and deposit the concealer right on our
lid just as a guide okay so I
did our my lid but because I have more
hooded lids I'm going to go a little bit
higher than that and I'm not doing some
crazy like 1 stroker like no we're gonna
go ahead and cut oh we're just gonna
start carving out the crease and
spreading that concealer wherever you
want it to be I like mine to be seen
when my eyes are open so I'm gonna go a
little bit higher than this and I'm
going in very slow baby strokes so
basically half our eye is a cut crease
and it starting to faint out here which
is totally fine fill in the rest of the
I laid about two-thirds of the way in
with the concealer I'm gonna lightly Pat
the concealer so I can take some of it
off with my finger so I'm gonna grab a
packing brush I'm going to show you two
tempura which is a very nice matte white
shade I'm gonna go over then concealer
to avoid creasing from the concealer
because if you have any lids like me
that has extra skin on it you will
crease a little bit it's which is
totally fine but what you want to do is
you want to set it before it can even
crease and this is on a more p.m. to
10:00 it's a nice compact hacking brush
but it's also very small and precise
which I love it for as you can see
there's like a harsh line there's like
the darkness and there's a lightness so
what we're gonna do is want to actually
change that I wanna grab another kind of
brush whatever brush you want to use is
fine any of the previous brushes is
great as well but I'm gonna take this
morphe 17 I'm gonna grab the shade burnt
orange red ochre raw Sienna just any
color you guys want to use it's totally
fine because it's just this is gonna be
the blend between the harsh darkness out
here and the white so I'm going to grab
this and I'm just gonna press over the
concealer as you can see it's already
starting to blend in like seamlessly
it's pretty cool back and forth right up
to that line and blend out that line up
here a little bit more as all saying
this not have to be super super neat
does not have to be super intense
literally this is just like an easy fade
think of me as like a fade like a hair
fade fading like when you're drunk and
you're about to pass out faint like that
so this is what should look like with
this fade and as you can see it's really
clean it's very pretty and I'm diggin it
I'm gonna finish the other eye off of
the camera real quick and I'll be right
back and this is your eye look this is
what you should have right now half cut
crease or two thirds cut crease now you
know I would call this look actually
this is a look man this is a
 left so now we're gonna go and
do the bottom lashline this part so easy
we're gonna take the shades
let's see burnt orange and roughly
enough and I'm gonna run that underneath
the lash line very
liberally this part you don't need to be
neat with you're just going to run it
underneath the eye let's take a little
bit of that red ochre and Venetian red
and we're gonna go a little bit higher
with that one whoo yes bitch be forty
three and a little bit of Cyprus number
and that's going to go closest to the
lashes on the outer corner only we're
gonna pack it on there now you can take
any cream or white eyeliner i'ma take
the colour-pop white eyeliner my
 is so broken I'm hoping I can even
use some of this and I'll put that in
the waterline give us a little bit of
pop look at that come on
and now you're gonna go and do a little
bit of a winged liner I'm gonna take the
Kat Von D tattoo trooper eyeliner this
is my favorite eyeliner like of all and
it's so good at getting a really really
nice precise line and I'm going to do a
little wing light-handed strokes like
henna strokes click and connect
and then fill in from there okay guys so
this is the final look this is what
everything turned out to be also on my
Instagram post I did put a little bit of
gold glitter underneath my lash line
right now which we will do right now if
you guys want me to I'm gonna take the
Urban Decay heavy metal glitter in the
shade a Midnight Cowboy so my favorite
shade that Urban Decay does it's just
such a good easy glitter to use it's
honestly the best so we're going to put
a little bit in turn part of my eye just
add a little bit of sparkle and this is
the final look guys this is what it
turned out to be
and that is it you guys that's it for
the entire cut crease look two thirds of
that way cut crease I don't know what
the bug I'm going to call this hopefully
you guys thought it was easy as well to
follow along I didn't want to make it
too hard I really wanted to explain as
much as I possibly could in this
tutorial because I wanted to make it
very like this is how to do it don't
worry you can do it too
that's kind of why I was a little bit
more like and the tutorial part because
I really wanted to explain the process
of what I was doing
I'm not saying this is an advance look
at all I just want to really explain it
as much as I couldn't I hope I did okay
