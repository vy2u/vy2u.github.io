today's video is going to be a tutorial
on this I like how going on right now it
is using my palette with makeup geek I
told you guys I was only trying to do as
many videos as possible filming with my
palette I really want to have as many as
I can off you guys because if you guys
are spending money on it I wanted us to
be able have some ideas or inspiration
from something to be able to create
looks with this palette and I don't just
like put it out there and like not
having tutorials you know what I mean so
this is the second one I'm filming right
now I already have one up and I hope you
guys like it I think this look is so fun
it's so different and it's not the
average look and I just love how to
turned out I love a good red marune
liner and smoked up bottom lash line so
do you guys like this look please
continue to watch as always if you guys
like this video if you guys don't like
me please don't fucking watch it you
know
like dumb but if you guys do like this
video and you guys do like me please
like this video and subscribe to my
channel if you aren't already and if
you're interested in the palette it will
be linked down below and yeah let's
gonna get into this video
okay so we are back with another man and
your white palate tutorial so excited
about these tutorial guys I'm just
really really excited to be filming
these so we're just gonna do as many as
we possibly can
what are we gonna so I have an idea in
my head of what I've done it to so it's
gonna make that happen
so just go right into it we're just
gonna jump right into the tutorial hop
on in
we are going to gray of beaches and
cream on a morphe 27 brush this is just
gonna go everywhere like I don't see
what I want to do is do a dramatic liner
so I want the lid and the crease to be
really really soft and not so intense a
little bit on the lid whatever you just
have left on the lid I'm already primed
by the way I have eye primer on so don't
even worry about it if you're thinking
manual what are you doing bitch almost
primed perfect socks when you have so
far just I'm very easy basically looks
like nothing is on your lid crease so
we're gonna got any more p.m. four three
three brush and frappe just a very nice
maple brown color and now shouldn't go
very slightly into the crease not a lot
though the reason I'm putting frappe
into the creases because I want to give
a little bit of dimension to the crease
not that much and I want to keep it on
the outer corner specifically just super
chill not too much and then a 20-7
blending of that out a little bit just
cuz I want it to be too harsh I just
want a little bit of dimension in the
crease and that is about it so this is
what you pretty sure look like very easy
and nothing to him just a little bit of
color in the outer corner and then we're
gonna go in with the fun part we're
going to be grabbing Mars of course
that's my red shadow and that V palette
and then you've got any liner brush that
you have I'm gonna be taking the morphe
m51 woah what are ya I'm going to be
taking the morphe m15 8 which is I'm
nice liner brush is what it looks like
it's really really good it's a very
small and defined and I'm just going to
pack that on to the eyeliner as if it's
as if it's a gel liner pretend out the
shadows a gel liner and that's what
we're gonna do I assumed in a little bit
more so you guys can see a little bit
closer be careful when dipping into Mars
because it is such a pigmented ass
shadow like I'm not kidding
it's fucking crazy and we're gonna pack
that one as our liner
okay and now we're gonna make a little
wing with it as well
just kind of sketch it out first the
wing is gonna be intense because this is
the main portion of this entire look so
don't be afraid to make it like a
ba-ba-boom wing cuz but you know I ain't
afraid
you know if you guys are freaked out
about doing this you can always use tape
a tape is a really good method to use
when doing this cuz you can just pile on
a bunch of shadow and have like the tape
make the wing sharp but I'm just gonna
use a little bit concealer to clean up
after anyway so don't worry about it if
you think it's like a little intense for
you you can do it I promise
luckily the shadow is so fucking
pigmented that I can just glide it like
as if it's an eyeliner see that shit 2z
- it looks so sick okay next is okay
great so we have both of the eyes done
at the top at least so i guess might be
thinking manual you have a little bit
more color in your crease than what we
remember well a bitch fuck step okay so
what happened was I was curling my
lashes off on camera and I was curling
him really close to the lash like the
lash line of course and like I stopped
curling and then I went I moved upwards
to curl like again and then some of the
part on the top of this transferred to
my lid the red and I'm like okay so I
had to just kind of work with some of
the red in the crease adjust kind of
blended it out I think it looks totally
cool I love it I think it looks awesome
I'm I'm not mad at the mistake you know
sometimes mistakes are really cool but
you want to keep it like dark brown just
keep the fat pay in there be careful
with the lot with this because it will
transfer apparently so be careful with
it but if you don't mind a little bit of
pink in the crease I don't at all I love
pink so whatever
yeah iPod house of lashes ikonics on the
eyes I'm starting to really like these
lashes a lot like I've been wearing them
a lot more recently and I think they
look really really really pretty
especially with this look when I'm just
doing a liner basically the whole look
so yeah I like it okay so it's gonna
move on to the bottom lash line I
already did the mascara notch it off
camera the we're gonna grab NYX Coco
eyeliner
you're gonna write lip liner pencil cool
so we're gonna use Coco lip liner and
that's going to go into the waterline
this color is so
freakin pretty it's like a red and brown
or take a little bit on the lashes as
well and then describe any pencil brush
I'm grabbing the e36 by morphine just
kind of blending that out a little bit
before it completely dries I'm gonna
grab a little bit of Sora on that same
36 and blend that out a little bit just
to give me some nice warm like cocoa
color back I'm gonna grab a morphe 43
and take Aphrodite which is a dark plum
that's gonna go closest to the lash line
just give me a really good amount of
definition and dimension just to make
sure it's a lot darker by the lashline
and then once you pack on with that
color go ahead and blend out with that
you 36 again just to make sure there's
no harsh edges as I was blending away my
lower lash line I decided you know what
I want to do a darker in a rim I don't
really I'm not really feeling the like
reddish brown I'm gonna go in with more
of a true brown I'm going with mr. right
now by the balm in the shade bill hey
Bill how much I like it's a little bit
too red on the waterline you know I
don't look like I have a disease not
feeling that look right now so we're
just gonna go in with that right now I'm
just gonna very lightly go over the
color already have down just make a
little bit more chocolaty and not as red
I'm not feeling that more I am feeling
that a lot more and that is the final
eyelid this is what it looks like this
is what it turned out to be I absolutely
love it such an easy look if you guys
want you can always highlight the inner
corner of your eye as well should we do
it I think we should come on I'm gonna
take the morphe M 3 to 6 and artemis and
just apply a little bit to the inner
corner so you look a little pop of saw
the Sun hang and now we're calling it a
day okay let me zoom you guys in to see
with the eye looks like up close
and that is it for the entire tutorial I
hope you guys like this video I had so
much I'll clean this for you guys I am
so into doing looks right now with my
palette obviously it just came out so
