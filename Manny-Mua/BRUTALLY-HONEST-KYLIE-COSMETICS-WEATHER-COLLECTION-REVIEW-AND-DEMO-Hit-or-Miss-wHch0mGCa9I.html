so it has been a minute since I have
films how have you guys been I hope you
guys have been doing fantastic I just
got home from Utah was in Utah with
Urban Decay for a little bit it took us
on a trip to learn how to ski and
snowboard and that was so much fun and I
just got home and I saw this package
sitting here for me at the house and it
is the Cutty cosmetics weather
collection hear that thunder oh so busy
I thought we really fun it to just go
ahead and do a review and demo of this
collection actually tweeted I was really
really excited about the collection
because I thought was super cute I
thought was really cute that I was
inspired by stormy who is her daughter
of course Kylie has a daughter now named
stormy I love a good theme you know I
love a good theme I love when a product
has like a story behind the park in this
whole entire collection is based off of
the weather and stormy and like very
lightning he and I really really like
that because it tells an entire story no
for me and my friend I'm gonna be having
like products that come out that revolve
around one concept or one story behind
it and that's gonna how I see my brand
going so when I see brands do like a
cool like collection or something behind
there or something a strong focal point
behind the collection I get really
really excited because to me just shows
a lot of thought and a lot of energy
going into a collection or a product you
guys know I've always been so so so
honest and forthcoming about my Kylie
collection reviews I'm always very
brutally honest about them whether I
think they're great whether or not
whether they're worth the price or
they're nothing worth the price this
collection is not any different in any
way just heard I like the collection
idea does not mean that I'm going to be
biased anyway or just because I always
send the product does not mean I'm going
to like make it seem like it's amazing
when in actuality it could not be
amazing I'm honest about that with every
fucking product on my entire channel I
feel a lot of you guys hide me for that
because I'm very very honest and
forthcoming without being like a dick
and that's how I feel I am I've always
been like that so today's video is no
different wanted to say that before the
video even started there's a lot of
products in here I really only wanted to
try it them out and test them out so I
left a lot of the areas of my face blink
because I wanted to have some
highlighters the eyeshadows the lip
products and the eyeliner as well so
we're gonna go right in as always we
guys don't like this video if you guys
do not like me please don't fucking
watching you know the drill with that I
say in every single video if you do not
like me if you like my vibe if you don't
like my videos it's all good you don't
need to watch me there's no point
leaving hate comments down below
just click off and that's all good I'm
not everyone's cup of tea at all but I
could be yours if you guys do like this
video please go ahead and click like and
subscribe to my channel if you're not
already and you're you
what is up I'm an emu and welcome to my
channel they're just drunk on my lap and
she wanted to make an appearance let's
go and get right into this Kylie
cosmetics weather collection and review
and demo we're gonna try a bunch of shit
out there's a ton of products in this
collection which is super super cool I
love when I see a big old collection
some people fucking frickin conviction
so let's go and start off with via
highlighter project I have no
highlighter on my face we have a loose
powder highlighter and we actually have
a new pressed powder highlighter one
side the faces and get one those hats
don't get another let's open the loose
cover I also love the packaging on this
so this is a grey packaging has like
that really cool like holographic
lightning bolt attached to it which i
think is stunning I personally really
like I like that every single part of
the collection has different elements
where I'm so like this is supposed to be
like a water droplet I'm assuming like a
little water droplet effect lightning
bolts lightning bolts a little cloud
we're gonna take the shade lightning but
we're trying to look at it and see what
kind of color it is I'm intrigued these
have been really nice every single one
of these I've used from Kylie has been
very very very nice so I'm pretty sure
this is gonna be the same if it's the
same formula there's gonna be no qualms
with this like that's another low little
lightning packaging so I just watched
her in here guys this is a lightning
bolt loose powder it's a very very
golden highlighter so basic it's like a
white with gold flecks in it I feel like
it might be a little too yellow actually
it's more of a yellow gold for my
complexion so we're not gonna actually
use that one we're gonna take the face
palette which I was actually more more
intrigued about but if you do like a
golden yellow a golden highlight you
guys will really really enjoy this I
think personally I'm not really into
yellow highlighters on my face it's just
not my thing so we're gonna go ahead and
not use that I'm gonna take the ladies
this is what I was excited for it dude
does my skin look so nice right now like
the skin is looking really like good let
me read the prices
let me read the prices we're gonna go
over the prices back up you guys so the
ultra glow retails for $14 I'm assuming
this one's but this is a kind of general
loose ultra glow next we go in we have
the highlighter palette
oh my god this is actually so fucking
cute like it has like the reflective
clouds and it has a velvety cloud like
actually feels velvety oh this is
fucking cute and then we have right here
boom a ladder
right there this guy retails for $44 so
this one is definitely more of a pricier
item not gonna lie it's kind of priced
high to me let's go ahead and swatch it
missing we think they feel pretty
fucking great
goddamn I just watched Stratus and let's
watch off for actually Stratus is like
the one that looks like the prettiest in
the pan it's this one right here as the
most like intense like reflection oh my
god so these are the four right here
these are the four highlighters right
there okay we have the four highlighters
right here every shade is beautiful in
its own way these are more of a foiled
finish these two are here they dream and
Stratus much more foil D and they're
swatch they have much more of a
reflection to them the two on the sides
cloud line and Golden Hour those ones
are a little bit more of a powdery
finished or not as amoliant as the other
two they're not as reflective to me the
middle two of the most reflective so
anyway let's go in try it on the skin
you guys probably took me fucking
babblers I fucking have the gums are
running I'm sorry we're gonna go and
take a morphe r-36 brush to apply the
highlight which oh I love this fucking
brush and the morphine r36 don't sleep
on this what can brush it's so good okay
we're gonna go in with the shade
daydream have come for blood honestly
this is so this is gnarly shades like
this to have like that really intense
emollient feel usually give off that
intense reflection so this is definitely
no different this is gnarly
oh my god well so far so good
holy titties we're gonna go ahead and
swatch this right here as well
these are dude these are really nice
like this is really nice for me so far
that this is a win oh my god it's like
so it's literally like so bright where
I'm like shook so what I'm looking is
straight into the camera like this I can
see that there's a little bit of a white
cast on the highlighted planes it's
almost like the color is a little bit
too light for me it's giving me like a
little bit of a cast when looking
straight into the camera but usually
highlighters are like this at a really
bright will give eye cast like no matter
what like it's kind of like an happen
and the smiles and shit like you're
gonna get a cast like I'm actually kind
of floored I'm not gonna like this is
really pretty when it's Estes its own
weight
oh my gosh they're so beautiful Mike
are you counting hi this is really good
it's fucking nice god damn that is $44
for that palette and it comes with point
11 ounces per shade so basically four
times 3.1 grams which basically it goes
out to about twelve point four grams of
product in this entire thing it's gonna
run a product I can't tell you whether
or not it's justifiable to spend forty
four dollars on it that's something
that's on you guys if you guys want to
spend the money awesome if you don't
awesome as well but I will say that this
worked very very nicely knowing that it
works so well now I would personally buy
this for sure now let's go and move on
to the habits we have the calm before
the storm
this cover here here and then we have
the I see I just like how it's so clever
here we have the two pounds right here
she is she that cuteness she right there
so it's going up and up we have the gray
one which comes with ten eyeshadows
that's this one right here and then we
have oh my god this is fucking pastel
shit and then we have this guy which
also comes with ten shades right here
let's go ahead and see how much these
cost
so the eyeshadow palettes retail for $40
for ten shades that retails about $4 per
shade however each shadows only point
zero three ounces this guy I will
definitely admit I think is the price a
little bit too high I would spend maybe
like thirty five bucks on this at the
most I think forty is a little bit kind
of expensive for me personally but then
again her pilots usually retail for
forty five for nine shades and this one
is 40 for 10 but they're smaller so it's
one of those things you gotta fuckin you
gotta think so these are the two pallets
right here these are from the stormy
collection I think that both pallets are
really unique this one is definitely
more of a pastel moment for sure and
then we have more of a dark stormy
collection right there so I don't know
what you going with you for meme this
isn't really giving me the transitions
that I personally mean and want this
color right here in the middle it's like
calling me this mint the mattes feel
great the mat feels oh my god the mat is
wonderful shit that's fucking pretty I'm
not necessarily little living for the
shimmers though I think they're a little
bit chunky what i'm swatching these guys
so i swatched this one swatch this one
to like this is more
chunkier situation going on you know for
me I'm just not into like the chunkier
intense shades the mats are beautiful
the chunkier ones I'm not a huge fan of
they're a little bit too powdery for me
in the yellow palette so I'm thinking
I'm gonna go and take that silver is ooh
I'm sick it's beautiful we're gonna take
this over that's what we're gonna do is
we're gonna take that fucking silver key
little hybrid said you guys you know I'm
just coming back to filming it's a full
moon right now I'm feeling my oats I've
done the waterbending vibes right now if
you are like what the fuck is wrong with
you what did you eat I love how all
these are like names something's so cute
we have like low names like electric
moon in back whirlwind Stargate cyclone
really really cute names so we're gonna
take this shit right here which is like
more of a shade again I do get annoyed
that this is I have a mirror I'm like
God I wish that this had a mirror
my eyes are fine by the way and go on
and that's too light no we're gonna take
the darker grayer one the purpley thing
okay so this is we have an eye so far
it's like this is like really weird
this color is actually so much lighter
than I thought in the pan tell me in the
pan that clerk right there that darker
gray right there it does not look dark
it's going on to me literally like so
light like a pastel
light greyish purple that kind of
shocked me I'm knocking oh hi by the way
guys that transition shade I went in
with a morphe m535i mazing for a
transition a very very very perfect very
fluffy it's just a really really really
nice blending brush it's extremely soft
I love this brush and I wanna take a
morphe r39 and that really nice deep
plum shade and go ahead and put that on
the outer corner I mean this is a stormy
collection I feel like I need to be a
little more smoky today this is a very
cool tone for me I just want you guys
all to know that I'm uncomfortable okay
we have this grace we have basically
have a gray smokey eye and honestly the
colors in here I not expect these colors
to turn into this I really did it for
some reason they're translating a lot
lighter on my skin and that usually does
not happen for me literally ever so the
glitter eyes retailed for $40 for each
pair which i thought was a little bit
right see and by load I mean it's
fucking expensive I was like wait for
real
thank you that ass or no okay so when I
first saw it I was like bitch that's
expensive I was kind of like oh but then
I remember that the Magnificent metals
glitters from Stila are twenty four
bucks and those have point 15 ounces
these guys have point twenty two ounces
so it has more and technically it's a
better deal because you're getting two
for forty basically one for twenty bucks
and the steel ones are twenty four bucks
so to me I was like okay you know what
that's more justifiable I still got a
little bit pricey I was a little like
whoa whoa Nelly
that's crazy but looking at it in that
way I'm like okay you know what it's
more justifiable the Magnificent metal
glitters are 24 bucks from Stila and
those are like the like industry
standard to me for glittery beautiful
shadows so we're gonna go and take one
of these guys I just wanna see how it
looks
hey guys I just watched one in my hand
but so this is one of them ring your
swatch and it's beautiful
it is a beautiful shade it's a really
cool unique like purple gray as like a
purple shift to it I don't you guys
didn't see on camera but it does this is
in the shade superstar so I went in just
swatch both of them so right here this
is what they look like it doesn't really
read glare to me it reads as more of a
really pretty electric eye shadow more
so than a glitter I'm gonna swatch the
Stila one next to it and this to me is
much more of a glitter okay guys so here
we have we're here this is the Stila one
this is a glitter EULA and it was in
middle shows when you look at like that
it looks like glitter these are more of
a pigmented ass-fuck cream shadow this
is more of a glitter so to me you guys
these aren't really glitters they are
more so really beautiful green shadows
but they're definitely not what they
claim to be they're not glitter
eyeshadows like the Stila ones are so
that's just what I think personally if
you guys think that's glittery by all
means awesome go you but to me that's
not a glitter that's a cream shadow it
doesn't have like micro find and glitter
sparkles Oracle's not that so I thought
I really wanted to put that on the lid
but honestly I don't I rather just keep
it on the Shadow Realm
so I'm gonna go in with that same silver
shadow cuz it is quite beautiful and
we're gonna go and put that on the lid
and see that's metal oh my goodness is
just stunning look at that that is
actually stunning Oh mother how she
create a formula because I want to know
how did you do this definitely it is
more of an intense shade it definitely
has some fallout that's still with
using it with my finger the effect is
quite beautiful in them chuckle Wow
she's kicking she's kicking huh okay
guys so I kinda wanna take it there
let's just do it you guys we're having
fun we're doing a fucking review why not
play with some color so we're gonna take
the eyeliner which is $14 and this guy
is a bright yellow eyeliner I believe
we're just gonna try this out y'all
I don't know how it's gonna go I really
don't mmm okay so I don't know if it the
part itself isn't as pigment as they
want it to be or it's the actually no
it's pretty pigmented look it's pretty
fucking pigmented I think it's more so
the fact that I'm using such a bright
eyeliner on such a dark eye it's not
translating as bright yellow as I wanted
to we're gonna have to just build and
get it there you don't so far it's
really really creamy glides very nicely
now is this the most bright yellow
eyeliner I've ever worn no it is not but
it doesn't gets the job done but it's
not my favorite eyeliner ever anyway
it's fine I'm just going to finish the
other eyeliner off of camera and a
little bit maybe I'll do a little bit of
yellow in the waterline to I don't know
uh see let's see hold on okay bitch we
made it fucking work I ended up using
the highlighter the loose one on the
inner corner to give me a yellow pop
there and on the brow bone to give me
still a little bit of yellow pop
obviously as you guys can see the whole
vibe here is yellow and grays and medals
and just very like fucking tell me like
you will not rule the world with this
fucking look at honestly crazy fucking
well we are down to the last product and
we have three lipsticks right here oh
very cute if there's our classic
lipstick so let's go and try these out
and see what we think I'm gonna swatch
all three of them this is a gloss gloss
who knew we have the three lipsticks
right here each of them are beautiful
m-i throat and like this really cool
metallized component we have the first
shade Nova right here which is in a blue
OH
oh my gosh do we see the cute lightning
bolt in the bullet I can love a little
detail so we have right here Nova which
is a really deep more so terra cotta
pink and this is nova right here as we
see it's a very very deep pink we have
next okay okay we have nightfall
right here holy fuck that's pigmented is
fuck look for a black lipstick that's
really really nice and now last but not
least we have cosmic which is a more
Brown tone nude which i think is
probably one i'm gonna go to with much
more of a cool tone right there we have
a cosmic very very pretty so lipsticks
you guys retail for $18 which is like a
classic lipstick Blin if I get the Mac
ones I think are skate een as well so I
just feel like that's a classic lipstick
and then we have flash gloss right here
I want to swatch that do I hate about
Patties gloss ones when you first
started out it gives you like it's like
a little crunch it gives you like a
little crunchy I don't know why it I
just fucking give it
so this is the gloss that gloss is
fucking crazy beautiful as like a really
beautiful golden purple pink reflection
it's all of its like cosmic as fuck it's
very flashy gloss you guys retails for
$16 that's a very fair price for a glass
16 bucks so let's go ahead and put on
we're gonna take this shade see they're
very pigmented how don't they say the
formula is more of a satin formula it's
not more it's not really creamy because
there's more pigment than that but it's
not I'm not by any means so it doesn't
say it's more of a satin finish feels
really comfortable on the lips okay we
add a little bit just maybe a little bit
of flash just like a hair
oh I can actually see the pinkness in oh
my god I can see it sickening I can see
the pinkness in it okay that's what the
gloss and this is the face y'all this is
the whole face using miss Kylie Jenner
weather collection and I feel like I
really took the weather the storm the
Lightning by the balls you know I was
inspired by then I was inspired by name
okay so that is it for the entire Tryon
portion of today's video that is it for
today's mo we did the entire thing I
showed you guys swatches I said you guys
the makeup on the skin I showed you guys
what it look like I'm the fucking daddy
and so now we're gonna decide whether or
not the collection was worth day what do
we think of the collection let's go and
break it down because as a whole I think
that as a whole the collection is really
really pretty I think that it's very
very cohesive but there's always some
things I would change about the
collection personally so let's go and
just dive right into that so a loose
eyeliner you guys I thought this was
really really pretty it's in my inner
corner right now it's on my brow bone as
well so we gonna give you a really
really pretty golden sheen to the skin
as you can see it's a golden finish on
both of them I'm personally not a huge
fan of yellowy highlighter served for me
this I would not purchase it myself
because I'm not a fan of golden yellow
highlighters it wasn't really a hit for
me but of course the product itself is
very pretty it looks really nice on the
skin it's just a personal preference
next we have the pressed powder
highlighting palette this was an
absolute win this is actually probably
my favorite product of the entire
collection I think it's beautiful it
looks beautiful on the skin I think it
looks so radiant and so blinding but so
like built at the same time it's just
stunning now let's go and move on to the
palette so you guys saw these palettes
honestly him the more I played with them
the more I wasn't like the biggest fan
to be honest and for me both these
palettes were not really a win
do the mattes work really nicely yes of
course they blend in really pretty they
look really nice on the eyes once you
get it there but for me it's the color
story it's the color scheme I just
didn't like the color scheme for these
personally you know like this one like
this pastel one I didn't really like
these shimmery shades I thought they
were all kind of too chunky and a little
bit too flaky that's like the right
where it's too flaky the mats were
beautiful but the color scheme I didn't
really enjoy for that one and same for
this one I didn't really really enjoy
this color scheme either I thought was
kind of hard to use and it would only be
like a cool tone palette I'm not into
cool tones personally this look I did of
course it's more of a cool tone look
it's not my favorite look I've ever done
I think it's turned out sickening and I
live for it now but I really have like
finesse and get there with a butt
different shades from this palette for
me it's just not a huge win color
story-wise next we have the three
lipsticks and let's do the same time the
eyeliner is not the best eyeliner gonna
come see yellow I definitely have tried
brighter yellows I think even the color
pop one is a little bit brighter than
this yellow and is a much cheaper the
Inglot light yellow liner is a lot
brighter than this a little bit more
expensive as well but if you guys are
looking for a yellow eyeliner that's
gonna work really wide it's gonna stay
on your eyes and this one honestly feels
really good it's not too heavy does it
feel too intense then hey great you guys
found a great yellow liner and it is
really really cute I love the little
lightning bolt on it I personally
wouldn't buy it to look at I know of
other yellow eyeliners I like a little
bit more the lipsticks were a complete
win to me I thought they were all so
beautiful I love that lightning bolt in
the press on the lipsticks I think
that's really really well thought-out I
think that it's really beautiful and I
think it really goes well with the
entire color story as well as the three
colors it's a blue yellow and gray color
story that's the entire color story of
the entire collection every lipstick was
very pigmented very beautiful the
lipsticks were a complete win to me and
I thought these were fantastic and last
but not least honey we have the gloss we
have the fuckin Galatz right here and
honestly the gloss grew on me I'm not
gonna lie the glass grew on me
it just ate every day gloss for me
absolutely not this is really intense
it's very very vibrant and crazy and
it's very electric definitely definitely
an electric glass I would not wear this
every day but it is very very very cool
it's a really cool addition to my
collection
I don't actually have a gloss color like
this at all though it's very very unique
to me and that's why I enjoy it so much
but is it the most wearable color not
really I think it's kind of a harder
color to wear when it comes to the gloss
spectrum and I like it over top a
lipstick maybe not by itself because I
think it would be too intense but over a
lipstick it's quite stunning so that is
it you guys that's it for my entire
collection review demo swatches of
everything here I hope you guys enjoyed
today's video I actually really really
love doing more reviews on full
collections and things like that I think
they're so much fun to review let me
know if there are other things you guys
would like me to review and try and demo
and we can definitely make that happen
before I head out of town again
but anyway congrats to Kylie cosmetics I
think that collection is beautifully
done some things were great some things
were not so good for me but that's kind
of how it is for every collection with
any brand that comes out with anything
I'm a little bit more hypercritical I am
a beauty person on YouTube and so I'm
very very
very like hyper aware of things and I
really like to dive into products and
just really go in and hone in on
products whether I think they're worth
the money or not so that is what I like
to do and if some people don't like that
I'm sorry and if brands don't like that
I'm sorry but that's just kind of what
it is that's how my channel will always
stay and it's always gonna be like that
I'm always gonna be 100% honest with you
guys and that's the most important thing
to me you know I'm building my own brand
in the future and I want to I want you
guys to know that I'm gonna try my best
to make the products as amazing as
possible I want you guys to always know
that and I know that I'm never gonna
like try to sell you buy something or
try to push something that I don't
believe in 100% yeah that's never save
you guys I myself am bling I time filled
in so long I'm just kind of like thank
you for the love and support you guys
have been so wonderful past couple weeks
I know snapchats been such a bitch
because it's like change the algorithm
and the whole thing changed and I feel
kind of disconnected from you guys
sometimes because of that change but I
know you guys are there and I know you
guys are watching him I sort of thank
you guys for commenting on videos and
tweeting me and Instagram commenting me
and damning me on Instagram and just all
these different ways you guys get ahold
of me because I really do feel the love
from you guys and even though a platform
might be taken away like snap shower
like word stock doesn't feel the same I
