feel so different feels so heavy on this
ear oh that's weird
that's fucking a weird do it hey guys
welcome back to my channel I was like to
be a genuine giggle I actually laughed
for real I don't know why I think if
something looking myself to me right now
and I'm like fuck how are you guys doing
this wonderful beautiful day it is
currently Monday and I definitely have
the case of the Mondays right now I
don't want to be doing shit I don't like
let me get some filming done I'm going
to stagecoach this weekend so I'm like
let's get some shit going and today I
thought we really fun to do a for review
and demo of the new Kourtney Kardashian
ex Kylie Jenner cosmetics collection
they came out with the collection
together they're sisters and we have a
cute little girl thank gym together
Kylie is clad with Kim with Chloe
now with Kourtney oh my gosh and I've
got Kendall's next maybe and I use all
the other stuff on my channel before
with the other sister so I thought was
really fun to do a full review on this
stuff right here and I was really really
intrigued as they came out with three
mini pallets and I'm like mmm how
practical are these mini pallets like
are they gonna be easy to use are they
gonna be like can you even do a look
with just one so I thought I'd be really
fun to do an entire video on these bad
boys right here I was very curious and I
actually really do enjoy these packaging
so but anyway that's what today's video
is going to be I'm gonna be doing IRA
for what I can't speak anyways you guys
that's what takes video is going to be
I'm going to be doing a for review and
demo on the new according X Kylie
cosmetics products and see what we think
of it are they hit are they amiss are
they good are they bad as always you
guys doing this video you guys do it
like me please don't fucking watch it
you know the drill with that you don't
have to watch me if you don't like me I
prefer if you watch me though and click
like while we're at it see this
highlight this highlight says go ahead
and click like anyway let's go and get
right into this review and demo so let's
get right to it I'm gonna pull up of
course I'm gonna put my little phone and
see what we have already gonna kind of
you site you we have these three pallets
and these guys retail for $24 each they
have the each come with four shades in
them which means each shadows about six
dollars and we have the three Velvets
liquid lipstick which is my favorite
Kylie formula they're amazing
I fucking love them so the classic
velvet liquid lipstick by itself retails
for sixteen dollars each
I think is a super super super a fair
price point actually I really really
like that so I'm assuming these guys are
also gonna be retailing for sixteen
dollars each what's going it right into
I have nothing on my eyes I have some
gloss on the list so I'll wipe that off
so we have it the blue one we have a
pink one and we have a green one
supposedly I really wish that each of
the palettes had a specific name and
they didn't just have like oh it's like
the blue palette because it's blue so
you open it up you have this guy right
here we have a blue
I blue background ringing it's our
believe this is what we ever hear this
is the blue one very very soft blue and
this one I actually fucking love I know
you can complete an entire look with
this and make it look just like this is
a great on-the-go close scheme I
personally think we have the green one
this one's not my favorite color scheme
it's okay it's not my favorite though
and then we have the pink one just
stunning which has a lot of like shimmer
shades and one transition shade for like
a quick on the go
a quick on the go so anyway we have
those three palettes and the each retail
for $24 has had earlier in each of them
we have about seven and a half grams of
product so good it's a good amount of
product in here at least each of these
have African name some thank God what I
will say those I wish that these three
were actually just combined I was so
just one long palette like this instead
having to do three different ones and I
know that they did it because people buy
more of them and so therefore just more
money and I get that of course like I
understand that like scheme but I
personally just wish that it was this
then we have a three lip kits of course
which we have red mini and French kiss
which will be swatching later on let's
go ahead just do a four eye look I'm
gonna just pull them all out and pull it
out
mad steam okay we're gonna go in
actually just swatch them all make our
mocha and then we will do and I look
with them maybe I'll do two different
eye looks one on each eye and see what
we can do okay we're gonna swatch the
pink one first so they feel wonderful
okay it's almost like it I just watched
the peach in it you see how about
falling off like that because it looks
like no it's like really crumbly this
usually happens when things are like
excessively pigmented like it's almost
like not pressed hard enough let's go
and swatch the shimmers as well the
shimmers feel great so this right here
you guys is the pink color scheme right
here this is the pink guy right there we
have the one nudie transition and we
have the three shimmers right here I
will say that the second and third
shimmer are actually very chunky like
their vicar and consistency they're more
chunky they're more flaky which of
course will give you more of an intense
shine but that's just kind of what I
noticed with these guys right here now
we're gonna go and swatch the blue one
again same with the hiccup it's super
super pigmented and lightly pressed is
very interesting to me oh I love that
one
so a second one right there of course is
the blue color scheme I like this one so
far the best it's watched the best I
like all the shades aren't chunky in any
way shape or form they're very bright
and intense but they're not chunky which
I really like and this matte swatch like
incredible megusta that one megusta that
one and I'm gonna go and swatch the
green one again pressed super lightly
it's okay this is the thing when they're
pressed this
lightly they feel really great and they
feel so smooth and they feel amazing but
so much product comes up it's almost
like frustrating in a way like it's
almost like to pick we did like everyone
wants it to be extremely pigmented right
but usually when it's that soft like it
can be a mess real quick as well try to
see but we'll see how it works with a
brush and this guy at the end right
there is the green powder right there
again they swatch like the second one I
really really like these shades more
when it comes to the swatch ability of
them they swatched better and they're
just smoother and a little bit more
creamy I mean swatch really good come on
shades so if you were interested in any
of the three I would highly suggest
doing the blue one is the blue one is
actually the most it just makes the most
sense it's the prettiest it swatches the
best and it just looks the best you
notice it really does that is just what
I think personally I also feel like this
packaging specifically like this it's
very kiddi like I just feel like it's
very I'm in elementary school and I'm
gonna be sold at Claire's like that's
how I feel like I just feel like it's
not tight and enough especially with
like this little like sticker that goes
around it with this like kind of cheap
bead glitter situation I don't know I
think that just the packaging could be a
little bit better
I'm like like it's just so childish to
me I wish I was better that's my
personal opinion now I'm gonna go ahead
and do and I look with them I really
wish is just one pallet
I'm gonna take the blue palette and I'm
gonna do an eye look with the blue
palette and see what we think so we're
gonna dip into the shade right here and
we have a lot as you can see there's a
lot of kick up a lot of pigmentation I
wish Sarah pressed a little bit harder
that's just me personally for example
when there's too much on the brush it's
a lot harder to blend like you almost
like want to go softly and build from
there like I just feel like because like
for example I just dusted off so much of
that product and I still have this much
pigmentation on the eye which is awesome
like it's cool but you don't want it to
be talking to words like overpowering
and you like have to blend away somewhat
it's almost like when you first got this
subculture palette behind us in Beverly
Hills it's like oh that was like rough
because there was so pigmented that
you'd wouldn't blend easily at least
this one is blending again I do think
that it's a little bit overly pigmented
you know that in the crease looks really
pretty I mean in a blended nicely and
God okay that looks nice I'm gonna go
and do a little champagne color this one
right here swatch is super nice yeah
that looks so pretty like I feel like
this palette is the one that you want to
take on the go this is a quick easy
awesome - your purse use it for an
occasion or two and you can smoke it out
with that really deep let me shade if
you want for like a more night out
occasion super pretty
yeah add a little bit of that freak in
that plum shade just to see what it
looks like
that's what that looks like this is
basically the only look you could really
do with this palette like this is the
look you're gonna end up doing every
single time or switch it out with the
gold that's basically it you have your
transition you have your deep outer
corner color you have to lid shades for
24 bucks so that just kind of depends on
what you guys think I think that's on my
eye like it works really nicely if you
like this color store and you like this
color scheme you'll enjoy it or if you
like Horning you like Kylie and you want
to get it that's awesome to like that's
all good but I think that you guys will
actually really enjoy the quality of
this squad I think it's really really
nice so it's number like here let's go
ahead and use su the green one and see
what we think of this one I'm gonna take
a little bit of that again look at that
there's a lot of kick up when I take
that into the crease it's like a gray or
purple
I do proceed though that they have two
mats and they have two shimmers in the
green and the blue one letting me sleep
but they're it's too powdery this is the
Clarys right here so right here I dipped
into it like it's literally just a soft
like like that and there's so much power
that comes up you really have to dust
off a lie which is kind of annoying but
it's not the end of the world cuz it's
like grayish tone right there and then
we're gonna go ahead and take that green
color look looks really pretty and use
it so I wanna put that on the lid you
see how that works
so this green shade right here you need
to build it up a little bit more which
is kind of annoying but the color once
it's on is actually really quite freakin
pretty Jesus this should have been one
pal it should not have been three for
example I just feel like you need the
other palettes to work as a whole and
you need to buy all three to make sense
of the entire palette and like for the
whole scheme and the whole color story
but buying three of those would equal
$75 for twelve shades so it doesn't
really make sense and I think that's why
you did it they're like oh like if you
have to buy all three to really be able
to get some good looks out of the
palettes that's my personal opinion I'm
speculating here I don't know anything
we got so far I think I look a little
crazy but it's so it's for the laughs
it's far that began oh fuck I should
have really thought this through
let's take that red underneath the lash
line here that's that's in the palette
so I not take it you know I mean this
red though is actually stunning really
pretty Jesus okay do I look like I look
like Frankenstein okay so these are two
different eyes that we could accomplish
with the palettes again as you see I
just feel like the blue one this side is
so much prettier and so much better and
so much more cohesive then the green one
and
pink one is definitely more so like just
hi Lee are you fucking tearing Oh
magnificent one is more so for like hi
lady shades things I'm just gonna
brighten up the eye a little bit more
we'll take that for the inner corner
because the other ones don't really have
highlighted shades ooh that one's so
pretty for there whoo
this one holy shit that's nice look at
that for inner corner highlight that's
stunning I mean why do I live for that
so much though why do I want to put the
sheen everywhere oh my god is literally
everything why yay
so that would leave Frankenstein let's
go and swatch the lot okay so those are
the pallets right there all in all the
one that is worth it to me is the blue
one that is the only one that I would
actually spend $24 on the others I would
not that's just my personal opinion the
big one I do like the highlight etype
shades of it I do think that they're
really really pretty I think that the
consistency of the two of the four
shades are too chunky for my taste is
are too gritty and the green one is just
doesn't really make too much sense to me
but I love the blue in this one I would
actually use some multiple times I
really really really like this one so
all in all the blue one is a go for me
let's go and swatch the three lippies
develops okay so we have French kiss
that shade already know I'm going to
love I already know they love it these
are the three lippies right here and
honestly I really liked all three so no
links for tuned we're just going to
watch them on the Han so you guys can
see what they look like in a swatch oh
my god it's done
so these are the three of the velvet
lipsticks right here all three of them
are so pretty and I'm actually really
really happy with how all of them look
let's go in swatch from the lightest to
the darkest off swatch to the new one
first this is the shade of French kiss I
think these will be retailing for $16
mmm so this is French kiss and honestly
holy fuck I love this color oh my god
that is a complete go it's a complete
win a hard go on that one a hard go
capture it if you can like a Pokemon
okay next we'll go in with we're gonna
go in with Minnie like Minnie Mouse oh
and another really pretty saying forgive
my swatch it's just one of those days
any we have Minnie right here
fuck this color is so stunning - okay
you mean it's closed everything this
color is everything it's like a terra
cotta warm very warm pink another go oh
my god I just note cohesiveness you know
I love that I just noticed that the
three caps are blue pink and green just
like the palettes work and it says court
along the side of it right there these
are definitely cuter than the palettes I
think these are look a little bit more
luxurious and a little bit more
higher-end
then I would say the palettes tubes
because the palettes look very like not
luxurious and nor high-end these are
better so now we're gonna go in swatch
the last one which is rad and this is
rad right here I love it I fucking love
it
radizen gratis in Miami song and said my
body it's in my home I love it the three
bubble lipsticks are gonna be retailing
I think for sixteen I could be wrong I
don't know but honestly I would say hard
yes all three of them I think they're
absolutely beautiful they all worked
really really nicely barn see guys these
three all of them a huge win for me I
think they're absolutely amazing and
they're beautiful an amicus yes okay
guys so that is it for today's video
what do we think do we think today is a
hard win I mean this collection is great
do we think it's a flop so first we
start off with the pallets okay the
pallets the outside of the packaging of
the pallets I actually think is really
adorable I love finding that's like the
like the holographic Fanus to it little
lips holographic water I really really
really enjoyed the unit carton of that
but that's not the point of what I mean
I'm just like really reaching for straws
here so basically for me the palette
that was a win for me is the blue one I
think the blue one is really pretty I
created this eye with the blue palette
and I think it's really really a pretty
palette the blue one I think is
definitely the prettiest of the three
and I would definitely order this one
myself out by the blue inks I think it's
so pretty and it's a great on the go
quick for shadows you can do a cute
little moment with this but you can only
do one moment with it or maybe two like
the gold on the lid I don't know I think
that's a
little bit harder with this kind of
palette I mean you can definitely do a
bunch of different things but if you're
the average girl on the go and you're
just like Ritz let me just get some
shades on me you're gonna be able to
create maybe one to two looks with it
because it's only for Shay it's possible
so it's like is it practical enough for
you who knows but for me how definite
suggest the blue one out of the three I
think the green and the pink palette
they're just not worth the money to me I
think the color scheme isn't really
there for me I mean honestly if the
three were combined together and it was
one big palette for like 45 bucks maybe
50 bucks I would say yes but because
they're all separate and you would have
to spend about one seventy three dollars
to get all three I would say just get
the blue one
and the other two I don't think you need
them like they're just not they're just
not the best for me I would say no
personally and for the lip products via
velvet liquid lipsticks I would say a
huge yes a hard yes I think all three of
the colors are beautiful they look
beautiful on the skin this is my kind of
formula that like bitch and this is my
thing I love a velvety formula that like
yeah has a little bit of transfer but
it's super super comfortable that's like
what I enjoy a lot I think that the lips
literally look velvety like I feel like
there's no creasing there's not like
ugly lines in it like it just looks
really nice so if you guys want to try
anything from the Lion how definitely
suggest the three lippies all three of
them looks great they just all were huge
yes so all in all there's six pieces
total and I like to four of the six so I
guess technically the collection is a
win I like the three lip kits in one
palette and two pounds I did not like oh
technically I guess overall as a hold
the collection was more of a win so
that's my opinion that's what I think
about this collection I think the
packaging could have been better but
that's just I'm a big packaging bitch
like I live for some really pretty super
cool packaging you guys will see that
later on with like my own line like I
live for that anyways you guys I think
this videos gonna be going up on
