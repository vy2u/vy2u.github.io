so I tell you is going to be a highly
ass requested video so I recently got
this a bad boy in the mail this was sent
to me by an associate Beverly Hills his
brand they did send me these subculture
pellets but that does not mean that I'm
not gonna be honest and 100% truthful no
matter what I get sent tons of products
from tons of different brands and I
always stay honest no matter what and
that's not changing for any brand so
today's video is going to be a review
and demo using the newest subculture
palette this has been in a lot of
controversy recently like saying that I
was like really powdery and that's not
blendable and things like that I had
used it one time but I only used about
three shades to do one look it was just
a quick one too and the shadows worked
fine for me I only I mean I only use
three so but today's video is gonna go a
little more in-depth and I'm gonna put
some of the more bold colors on my eyes
say to see how they work and how they
blend with the other colors in the
palette as always if you guys don't like
this video if you guys do not like me
please don't watch it you know
the joke with that but if you guys do
like this video please subscribe to my
channel if you're not already and your
free new what's up a man um you a and
welcome to my channel thank you so much
for being here I really really
appreciate it but yeah let's only get
into this review and demo using these
new subculture palette by Anastasia
Beverly Hills so a little bit about the
palette this retails for $42 on on a
Sasha's website there's 14 shades in
here there is one two three four five
six seven eight nine 10 11 11
mattes in here which means there's only
three foiled slash shimmer shades wow
that's hard to say as you can see
I used this color this color and I'm
gonna try to do a different look just so
I can use as many different shades on my
eye as possible so you guys can see what
they look like or how they act so we're
gonna take the shade on as you guys can
see as I'm pressing into it there is
tons and tons and tons of fallout
there's no denying it there's definitely
a lot of fallout we're gonna mix it a
little bit with the shade mercury which
is a little more of a cool can you see
that it's a lot powder there's a
lot of powder going on here so I'm gonna
go ahead and put this into the morphe
m-53 3
today blending a fluffy brush okay okay
this palette is extremely pigmented holy

first of all I'd actually expected
mercury to be this dark we're looking at
it on the pan it looks like a very very
light transitioning gray here it looks
like darkest okay don't know why
hmm what do y'all think
iw they went on a little bit darker than
I was expecting for sure let's go and
take the shape axis right here which one
take the shade axis we're gonna put it
on the lid on the outer lid holy
these are really pigmented holy
I want to tweak a little bit on the
inner corner as well so the shade axis
is extremely extremely pigmented a
little bit product goes a very very long
way this one I feel like is one of those
treats that's a little bit too pigmented
where it's like oh if you mess up a
little bit it can like go awry very very
quickly so be cautious of that this
color is actually a little bit harder to
blend out then they'll actually type in
it's a little bit more of a you really
need to sit and work with it you know
really work on in now I'm going to take
the shade destiny right here it's a very
pretty military green shade I'm gonna
lightly softly press that without seeing
it four three three in the center
how's it good towards the center in here
I'll bring that in so if you guys were
to get this palette I just think that
the blend is a little bit tougher to do
than other palettes that I have yeah cuz
I'm really I'm really really really
really working here on blending this out
and I'm not really getting too far with
it uh yeah okay so this is what we have
so far as you can see the blend is not
as seamless as I usually like it I think
it's a little bit more patchy kind of
annoys me now I'm gonna take the shade
all-star holy this one is extremely
thick I'll urge us pressed it twice oh
my god oh my god and I'm taking on a
morphine m16 seven a great packing brush
I'm gonna pack that on to the center of
the lid
I'm really just playing with as many
colors as I can because I really want to
be able to have a nice definitive
thought on this palette so I'm using as
many as I can I'm sure some of you guys
are thinking man you what in the
are you doing with this I I'm like you
know I'm just kind of playing around I'm
just doing my thing and I think that
into the crease blend into the crease
she's a little weird because I feel like
when I'm blending this all-star shade
it's kind of blending into nothing I
just like it's not as pigmented as it
once was when I put it down so a little
bit more in the center it's just not as
easy to palette to blend as I thought it
was going to be I feel like my crease is
starting to look a little bit muddy
um the colors starting to blend together
a little bit in a weird way they're not
like sticking to my eye specifically I
don't know I don't know guys I feel like
this look is a look I could have easily
easily accomplished and like with no
problem and have a nice seamless blend
but I have to really really work on this
blend so that's kind of weird I'm gonna
take a little bit of that sheet adorned
and I put that on the center of my lid
just on a really really really center
point okay so now I'm gonna take a
little bit of a pencil brush and I'm
gonna take these blue yellowy type
shades the shade edge and NuWave and I'm
gonna go and run that underneath my lash
line really dust off as much product as
you guys possibly can I'm gonna take a
little better shade at Roxy I'm gonna
put that into the crease right here
maybe that'll help warm up the crease
make it not look as like blotchy and
weird this is also a very very very
powdery shade and now I'm gonna take the
shade Rowdy which is like a really
pretty dark plum --is-- really deep deep
deep cool tone purple and I'm gonna put
that on the lash line down here ooh a
little blend blend out that shade you
guys I'm sorry I find being a little
more quiet in today's video I just feel
like whenever I'm doing a look like this
or something that I need to really
really really really concentrate on I
get a lot more quiet so I'm like wait
 I need to really focus on the look
you know I'm saying which kind of sucks
I feel like what this palette yeah I
think the look turned out to be pretty
cool but I had to really really
again really a lot we're gonna take the
shade Electric which is like a really
intense weird like yellow-green I'm
gonna go and swatch over here I'm gonna
show you guys what it looks like right
here on the inner corner and this brush
gives you like a very subtle almost like
UV glow that's kind of a cool shade
that's very different and never seen
shade like this so this shade is
actually taking a lot more building than
I thought like the other ones we're so
pigmented where I was like shook this
one you need a lot more to actually
build on to it let's take that shade
cube and be done with it we're gonna
take that on the brow bone this is a
white with a pink reflect it's basically
pink like when it goes on the skin it's
pink it's not like white at all as you
guys can see there's like a pink reflect
on my brow bone this one is another
shade that takes a little bit more of a
building to it okay guys so this is it
this is the look I ended up coming up
with using the subculture palette I
think it's really cool fun give her a
look for me I don't really do too many
looks like this I just feel like this
palette wasn't the easiest palette to
blend out that I have I think that I
have other palettes that blend out a lot
easier than this I think the fact that
they're so powdery doesn't really allow
it to stick to the skin as much I don't
know if that makes sense
and when I say powdery let me show you
guys what I'm talking about so for
example let's take the shade down right
I'm taking a little fluffy brush you
just kind of do this and I know if you
can I don't you guys didn't see on
camera but a lot of product gets picked
up but I think that's kind of I don't
like Roxy for example same thing same
exact concept with Roxy as well usually
I'm obsessed with an associate cause I
think that they do beautiful palettes I
love their color schemes for example the
modern renaissance is like one of my
favorite paths of all time this has
gotten some usage as you can see it's so
tore up because I use it so
often and these shades are very powdery
- do not get me wrong these shades whoo
child powder but for some reason I've
like the modern renaissance palette the
shades blend easier than these
subculture palette shades do and they're
a little bit more true to color I feel
like these shades are much more like oh
yeah that's exactly what I'm gonna get
soon as I put it on my eye that's the
color but subculture one I just felt
like they look a little bit different on
the eye than they do in the pan kind of
weird I wasn't really expecting that but
that's totally what happened
all in all what do I think of the
pallets I think that for $42 for 14
shades I think that's a great price
point however I think that this palette
for me is more of a Miss I just really
don't think that it's the most practical
and I feel like if you're more of a
beginner I'd make up it's gonna be a
little bit difficult to use I really
really do I don't think it's gonna be
the easiest like let's just let's just
do a quick little eye look with the
subculture it's not as easy to use it's
much more it's much more work I would
say for me personally I probably will
not be reaching for this palette again
because of the fact that it is a little
bit harder to use for example I can take
Jeffries and drogyny palette technically
this palette has shades that are similar
to Geoffrey's palaces without first but
I feel like those shadows blend easier
and they're just as pigmented just as
nice discipline is a lot easier they're
not as powdery so I just don't think
I'll really be reaching for this palette
very often so for me it was a Miss it's
not a hit but like I say in all my
videos no brand ever comes out with
things that I'm going to love 100% of
the time there's always gonna be things
that I'm obsessed with like the amount
of Renaissance
there's things I'm not gonna be obsessed
with like the subculture palette or -
osseous so I think that Anastacio is
brand in general is absolutely beautiful
it's amazing they killed it in
the beauty world and I really do think
that their brand is like one of the
forefront beauty brands of all beauty
brands I think theirs is like one to
look at like wow people are excited
about on a sauciest brand which is why
what do I even wanted to film this like
I was excited about this palette and I
was just had to film this
yeah you guys that's it for today's
video as always give us a night or day
wherever you guys are and I'll catch you
guys in my next video bye guys
can y'all hear me you guys this
foundation of oxidized so intensely
Jesus I went on like my color and there
turn orange whatever
clothes sweet yes

swollen I'll see you later peace
