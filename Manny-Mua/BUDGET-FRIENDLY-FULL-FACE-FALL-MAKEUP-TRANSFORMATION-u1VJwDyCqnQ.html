the laughs it makes its ugly appearance
every time so what is of you
guys it's been a minute since I have
filmed and just sat down and chatted
with you guys I'm going to be filming
today a tutorial and actually I'm gonna
do a full face fall tutorial using items
that are more budget-friendly
these are all great items that I do have
here things are from colour-pop things
from morphe things from the drugstore
and so that so today's video is going to
be I have a couple new items here that I
would love to also incorporate into this
video but first oh my god I'm so
I'm so excited but first I want to talk
about something really quickly I'm doing
in the month of October so at the end of
the week of every week of October I'm
going to be doing a giveaway and I'm so
excited because okay guys and the reason
I'm doing this is because I'm not the
biggest like Halloween tutorial person
I'm not really good at doing that kind
of stuff I never really learned how to
do any nut stuff a lot of you guys do
know that I am like YouTube taught like
in the beginning I didn't really know
how to do makeup for a long time I
didn't even start playing with makeup
till I was like 21 22 so I don't really
know tons of things about like Halloween
makeup or special effects or face
painting and none of that stuff so I
always feel kind of bad in the October
time because I feel like I'm not like
giving you guys what you guys want and I
always feel guilty I don't know why it's
just a good personal thing I'm always
like man I'm not like good at that
stuff so I get a little down on myself
so what I decided to do in the month
October is do this giveaway I'm going to
be giving away an iPad or a MacBook Air
so these two guys are gonna be in
giveaway so I bought two iPads I bought
two MacBook Airs so on Sunday the 8th
I'll be announcing who wins the I pad
Pro and you guys this is the easiest
giveaway ever all you have to do is we
subscribe to my channel that is
literally it I will be announcing my
giveaway winners on snapchat

so tired to be doing this of course it
is open internationally and if you're
younger than 18 with a parent's

snapchat right here floating in the air
this is my snapchat handle follow it and
we will but okay guys that is enough of
babbling going on for two days video I'm
gonna go get started let's go ahead and
do this fall tutorial using all
budget-friendly
so let's go and get started on two days
of video first thing source we're going
to prime our skin I don't really have a
drugstore or budget-friendly equivalent
for a primer you guys know a primer that
you guys love from the drugstore or just
one that's a little bit more
budget-friendly
let me know in the comments bar below
but for now I'm going to be using the
morphe prep and set setting spray this
is a prepping and setting spray so I'm
gonna prep the skin this is back in
stock so I'm like bitch I'm gonna use it
love love love this setting spray I love
that it's such a fine mist I also love
the fact that it keeps my makeup on a
lot longer when I am using it
and of course when I'm using it to prep
as well and you guys know of course I am
an affiliate with more if you can use my
code man emu and all caps in store
online if you guys want to save some
coin on some more free stuff I do have a
couple more few items into these videos
so I wanna let you guys know I'm gonna
Philly with them I try not to push too
hard about it but I do like to let you
guys know that I am a morphe affiliate
it's not like I'm putting my
code on a hoodie so I grabbed these are
the two like cost-efficient foundations
that are probably my favorite these are
the Maybelline matte and poreless fit me
and I have the Milani conceal and
perfect two-in-one foundation okay this
is in the shade too natural like
literally one of the lightest shades and
it's a little bit too dark for me and
it's so annoying
that's the I like the finish of this one
more than I like to finish up this one I
feel like I'm gonna look really yellow
with this but let's just try it bitch
okay a little bit of that because we're
gonna do the Maybelline we're gonna do
Maybelline
matte and poreless in the shade 130 and
I'm taking on a more feet why is 6 this
undertone is a lot more neutral I feel
actually really really really like this
one it's super pretty I'd like the
coverage of the Milani one a little bit
more I like to go ahead and apply this
kind of foundation too with a dense
kabuki brush cuz it really builds up the
coverage a really nice lean spot this is
still like too dark for me or whatever
y'all bitches
NoHo I'm ok with using darker from Nisha
it just it is annoying though because I
feel like it's really hard to match at
the drugstore like that's when I have a
problem matching my foundation so I
don't like ever really like to open it
we're gonna take this down the neck - we
have to because look at that
difference Jesus I will make it a point
to go out and buy more foundation shades
from the drugstore how's it feel like
Maybelline has such a great range of
shades in their fitting collection
you'll have to do the matte and poreless
you just do the normal fit me and it's
not as mattify
as this one is not saying this is super
mattifying cuz I still look like I look
pretty skinny he's gonna like so
now a for affordable concealer we have
the Maybelline master conceal you guys
this is my favorite drugstore concealer
that I have found so far other than the
Maybelline fit me that one's pretty cute
too but this one is more coverage so
I'll just take a little dollop this is
in the shade of light by the way and
I'll take my little what is that drop
running down that is disgusting okay
we're just gonna apply some concealer
over that because I really feel
disgusted right now you guys if you guys
not have tried a foundation or concealer
or use something in a little bit of a
while don't forget to shake it it could
be separated in the tube or in the
bottle yeah yes you guys hate that okay
you guys what I like what the concealer
is that gives you such a nice amount of
coverage it's more of a medium to full
coverage Mabley and I just feel also
does really good concealers they have
that other one that has like that little
puff ball at the end of it I don't like
that one personally it's not my kind of
concealer that I like I'm more of a fit
me and the studio kind of girl a lot of
people love that cute little like better
lord I don't know what the - it's
called honestly I'm taking this on my
little Real Techniques Beauty sponge you
can find this in the drugstore as well
it's such a great alternative to the
Beauty Blender just as soft and just as
squishy and literally one-fourth the
price so okay now that we're concealed
and looking like you're
looking kunti so now we're gonna do is
we're gonna go and take the wet and wild
contouring palette contour Dusen legit
that's what it's called
it's Lulu civilian chick I want to take
this highlighting shade and we're going
to go and really saturate our brush and
set underneath the eyes because I don't
really have a loose setting powder that
I want to use from the drugstore or more
of a cost-efficient alternative not
really big we're just gonna set we're
just setting right now I used to
actually really not like this powder at
all I use like not the biggest fan I was
like why is everyone living for it I
give it another try and I actually
really really really like it I think
with makeup in general like you guys
really need to continue to give things a
try like I tried this the second time
and I liked it a lot more than I liked
it the first time so maybe if you guys
try something you don't love it the
first time just give it a second go this
is a expensive brush we're not gonna
talk about this we have an alternative
this is the Wayne Goss 0-2 brush this is
super super super super expensive but we
have the morphe alternative which is the
e 48 very very very similar the Wayne
Goss one is just a little bit fluffier
literally the exact same thing as the
Wayne Goss one I just had the wing cause
one in my hand so because of the matte
and poreless foundation kind of sets
itself it is a mattifying foundation I'm
just gonna take whatever is left on the
little
I'm just gonna run it over some spots
with the face this is like so we can
avoid having to using a whole entire
different setting powder when we're on a
budget sometimes you just don't have an
excess powder to Hugh's you know I'm
saying but guys very very little amount
of it because you don't use too much
because it will like highlight your
entire face and that's not what year
we're going for it I'm gonna take that
same dupes elaichi and I'm gonna take
that contouring shade I want to take the
morphe y9 favorite contouring brush ever
put that into the hollows of the cheeks
to really give us that nice contour look
but not being too intense just a little
like some some take a little bit on the
temples as well there's a really make
sure it all looks really cohesive and
nice and if you guys want to bronze I
just did a little bit of contouring
right now if you want a bronze you guys
totally can I'm gonna take the
Physicians Formula butter bronzer which
is my favorite bronzer from the
drugstore I absolutely love it on a more
feet eetu is great for bronzing it's
great for powder any kind of powder
application this is fantastic I'm going
to little quick little one too you know
everything just make sure everything is
blended seamlessly between the bronzer
and the contour shade if you guys do not
want to do this up it's totally fine you
can keep it at just the contour but I do
like how the Physicians Formula bronzer
does give me a little bit more of a
warmth to my face a little cheating
trick take that a little bit of that
under-eye powder that we use from wet
and wild just cleans it up a little bit
underneath that contour okey nothing
crazy it just gives a little bit more of
an enhanced look so now we're going with
some blush we're gonna take the Milani
Luminoso blush I haven't used it so
 long holy on a morphe for
it's just a beautiful pretty peachy pink
blush has a little bit of Sheen to it
nothing too crazy though it's not
something where you're like overwhelmed
like highlight all over and I feel
like this blush blends so nicely as well
I also just wanted to do a dab of this
I've not tried this yet I just kind of
want to show you guys on camera what it
looked like this is the color pop
pressed powder cheek in the shade take a
little dab but I wanna see what this
looks like on the skin just a little bit
just oh she paid with you oh okay well I
will figure out what the name of this is
don't worry and I will leave it linked
down below I trying to get my cheek a
little bit more of a pinky pop this is
colored pop this is $4 it's such a huge
amount there's six grams of product in
here I think that's really really great
just the way it goes on the skin I bet
it will wear really really really nice
so now we're gonna go and highlight the
skin and I've been this so excited this
is the Maybelline master chrome
highlighter I've used this once on my
channel before I think it's
amazing I've used it many time
iving in tub I've dipped into this bitch
so many times that they have just talked
about it once it's so beautiful
I'm like Maybelline really it's like
y'all bitches wonder if I can really
comfortably
so we're taking this on a morphe m 510
which is done really really really nice
it'll highlight new brushes really great
really compact like I'm sorry but for
the drugstore bitch like come on
from the waist uh bitch whatever
I get like so hyped about makeup I get
so like Kirsty I apologize for that it
gets me so hyped like I get like I want
to just scream mmm are you kidding like
I'm sorry but this truly to me is like
the prettiest drugstore highlighter that
I've ever used other than the Wet n Wild
highlighters which I love so much too we
are using the budget-friendly items but
we are going to look snatched to the
 ground and we are not gonna look
budget that's we're sure I
guaran-fucking-tee we ain't gonna look
like we own a budget can we contour my
nose a little bit I'm not scared though
cuz I use a specific color for my nose
contour always and take this and use it
to control my nose man and we're taking
that on a morphe brush I don't know
exactly what brush this is I just really
like it for nose contouring because it's
tapered but it's really fluffy I think
it's part of the rose gold collection
I'll figure it out and I'll put a link
down below that's pretty good if
I say so myself taking that same morphe
setting spray gonna do another one too
so we just finished off with the
khadiyah and I think it looks super
super snatch I think that we did a
really really great job at picking
budget-friendly items to do the
complexion I think it looks beautiful it
literally looks like I'm wearing
high-end foundation high-end everything
other than this blush I've worn
everything else on my face and I think
it looks beautiful and I know
alas and I see on the skin so let's go
ahead move on to the brows and the eyes
now we would go ahead and continue on
with this tutorial this is what the face
looks like up close you guys this is
what she looks like she's feeling her
 oats now what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna go on and move on to the brows
and I'm gonna do one brow on camera or
at least like more of a sped up like
version of my brow on camera and I
really want to talk about this product
really quickly because I have uses for
and I actually really really like it
this is the new morphe micro brow pencil
it is $5 I've never found a cheaper
alternative to a brow product than this
one for five bucks and it actually works
really nicely I will say that the
Anasazi brow Wiz is a little bit better
I do like it a little bit
for sure I think that for someone on a
budget five bucks for a brow
pencil that's so fair but I will notice
that these do dry out a little bit
faster than the other brow pencils that
I have do so make sure that you do keep
the cap and cap it because they will dry
out a little bit quicker I'm going to
start to coat the brow I'm taking the
shade mocha by the way there's a couple
shades for it product is going down
really nicely consistency wise it does
remind me more of the Anastasia brow is
like it's not too creamy but it's not
too dry either and how I like to do my
brows I like to start at the bottom base
of my brow and then build from there of
a major sparse area right there
I like to fill that in I could
definitely go dark with the rub pencil
but I kind of like that it's lighter I
have to go like multiple cloves in my
brows I'll do like a dark brows
sometimes where I'll go lighter with the
brow like right now I feel like I'm
going really light with the brow and
then the spoolie here is great just
gonna go ahead and spoil you that oh
there you go we have one brow on another
brow I'll be right back I'm gonna finish
the other brow off of so now we're going
start on with the eyes I'm gonna be
taking that same master conceal
concealer and we take a little bit and
that's gonna go on our eyelids as our
eye primer and we on a budget bitch we
don't ain't got no time for I
price we're gonna run that all over the
eye up to the brow bone to finish off
with the brow I went ahead and I use
that same concealer and I line at the
bottom of my brow with some concealer
just to make it look a little bit more
sharp we're gonna take that same
wet-and-wild highlighting shade we're
going to press that on to the lid just
set the concealer in place a little bit
of concealer guys goes a long way okay
guys so let's go ahead and start on the
eyes now I'm actually really really
excited to be doing this because I'm
going to be using the new morphe 35o 2
palette so morphe acquired investors and
so now everything is kind of I just feel
like everything's vamping the
presentation of everything is ramping up
they just changed their logo out now
it's this so we're gonna try the morphe
35o 2 and i just grabbed 35 out just to
compare for you guys just to see cuz I
know a lot of you guys are asking me to
use the 35 oh so if I vote - it's
 beautiful
we have the 3500 right here which of
course is also beautiful to see we're
gonna both in the frame you can
definitely tell that they are sisters
they're not twins but they're definitely
definitely sisters the 3502 is a lot
more warm than 35 oh so if you're into
really warm intense shadows that are
just like a lot more like Bava Bomi
which I am
then I think you will really really like
3502 so and I believe it to be the same
price 35 shadows for $22 and I think
that for this video when we're doing
something that's a little bit more cost
efficient and a little bit more
budget-friendly I think that more fee
pellets are fantastic and I really
really really appreciate that about the
brand that's why they're one of my
favorite brands to be affiliated with so
recently I have been doing fall looks
the last too far looks I have done have
been very like red and grungy and purple
and using that goes intense fall color
so Forte's we do I do something more
orange II a little bit just different
this shade here is just speaking to me
bitch so first things first I'm gonna go
in with this cute little transition
right here on the top left corner on a
more for a 20-7 really great blending
brush I'm gonna put that into the crease
or it's gonna go in guys we're just
gonna go the in it's just one of
those shades that's gonna be really good
for a transition nothing too heavy just
gonna make everything blend a little bit
easier to like sense after Jacqueline's
palette everything's been stepped up a
lot like it really really has this feels
more like Jacqueline's palette than any
other palette I've ever tried from them
but if I know of course is wonderful
when I use that one so often but I
already feel like this one's a little
bit better like I really do mind you I'm
only into one shade so I don't really
know technically but that's just kind of
like as I'm talking I'm just kind of
talking out loud and sharing my opinion
so far with you so I'm gonna going with
this like little it's almost like a baby
pukey shade I can describe it as really
have no idea on a morphe r39 which is a
great condensed blending brush it
reminds me a lot of that like that Mac
217 style brush we're gonna do into the
outer corner that is so pretty
what's gonna run that all the way into
the inner corner and then guys so when
I'm on the outer corner of my eye
because I do have this hooded lid action
going on over here I tried to take it up
a little bit higher and like fake the
crease a little bit higher towards the
end of my eye just so it looks like it's
all like jus you know it means it's all
like a long gated out here and I won't
blend that out again with that you 27
just to give it a little bit more of a
seamless blend so now we're gonna do
guys we're gonna take this really pretty
deep ass like maple red Brown this one
was a little bit more fall out a little
bit more powdery kickback than the other
shades did so far just an observation
that I did notice is on a morphic r39
its continuing on with that I don't put
that a little bit lower than that
original pukey shade right there
the eye it blends and it looks just as
nice as the other she did so are you mad
at it if it's nice on the eye and it
blends nicely he's gonna give a
about fall out a little bit fall
out nah
so i'm swatching right now some colours
for the lid to the floor I've been like
gagging for it now these shades are here
this one I feel that one makes me want
to scream so now I'm gonna take
that really pretty golden e-type shade
and I'm gonna run that on the lid this
one right here runs down the lid so this
shade guys as I'm putting it on I notice
that this one's a little bit more flaky
then the other shimmery shades are I
just notice it like right now but it's
very very pretty on the actual eye yeah
this is like one of those things that's
like really flaky and that kind of stays
on your finger I can't really explain it
it's like hard to explain that kind of
shape you're better off packing on then
swiping but it looks sick on the
eye mmm go ahead and wipe out the
fallout I'm gonna try wetting the brush
applying that same lit Jade a little bit
over cuz I feel like some of it blended
away I'm gonna see what it looks like
when you do it wet yeah I feel like this
shitty needs to be wet when you're
applying it for sure okay so so far so
good we have everything on the eye looks
 beautiful on the high I'm so
happy now we're gonna mix a couple of
these shades guys we're gonna mix a like
these two right here this guy over here
we're gonna blend that underneath the
lash line is part I feel like you don't
need to be too like meticulous with on
the morphe r41
or running it underneath the lash line
more so on the outer corner and then
blending a little bit in to the inner
corners I do want to put that really
pretty copper on the inner part of my
eye you guys honestly I definitely see
myself using this palette more I'm
really really really excited about it
that it just came out I believe that
this bad boy launches on the 12th of
October so it's actually coming up super
super soon okay so now we're gonna take
that same bronzy shade that I wanted to
use we're gonna put that on the inner
corner of the eye oh my god
mm-hmm I'm banana morphe m2 ten now
taking that same dark plumbing shade on
the lower lash line that I took in the
crease to make it deeper to give us some
dips
now I'm gonna teeth a little bit of that
black I'm gonna put that on the outer
corner
holy okay we're taking out now more
if you are 36 amazing pencil brush my
favorite pencil but actually take a
little bit into the crease really low
though guys we're just really key to
keeping it concentrated on the outer
corner this gives a little bit of
darkness on the outer corner but not
make it look - like Gnarls Barkley you
know I'm saying I'm genuinely very happy
without looking right now I love how it
looks taking a little bit more of that
gold I have all my lid on the inner
corner I'm gonna take that same black
eyeshadow from the morphe 35o - palette
on this morphe 43 great precision like
lining brush I'm gonna take that and I'm
gonna bring that along my top lash line
in it to make it give me like a faux
eyeliner look just give me a little bit
of definition I'm doing like little
pressing motions to really make sure the
pigment gets down okay much better much
better go and curl the lashes so I
grabbed this little guy from Rimmel this
is the shaky first clump free of Volume
Mascara and you literally shake in the
 bitch
like shake weight to pull it out this is
what the one looks like actually I'm not
trying this if I really wanted to try
this one this is one of those things
we're trying on camera for the first
time you guys indefinitely used your
favorite drugstore mascara whatever
works great for you amazing
it says clump free of volume and I see
literally no volume what I see club free
I agree with the clump free claim oh she
rub oh this is rough okay so the formula
itself is a very very very liquidy if
you blink too fast you will get it
everywhere okay these my lashes have
literally never looked worse I don't
think I hated my Fuhrer I hate
it
that's a flop now ain't it we're
taking Maybelline big shot because
honestly I mean it's already from
the first one but hopefully we'll give
it a little bit of something sure just
stuck with picture on the
beginning now it's time for the lashes
and I'm actually not going to be using a
nice pair of lashes today usually when
I'm doing drugstore videos I always use
like a pair of like mink lashes from a
brand that's like hi
today I really wanted to keep it to
doing something that's a little bit more
affordable so I'm gonna be taking the
faux mink ardell lashes from ardell
these scheme will be found at the
drugstore and I'm gonna stack two pairs
because I need something I need some
volume I need something I'm sorry so I'm
just like to 811 I'm gonna stack the 812
together okay guys so I just literally
try to put on those two pairs of Ardo
wispies they were literally so animal
and really really mad I didn't want to
subject you guys to that so what I
decided to do is grab the biggest ney
aisle or luxe collection bronze Beauty
lashes I'm gonna go and just take this
pair of lashes instead and apply it
because he looks so much these looks so
much better okay and here we have the
actual lashes on they're not like my
favorite pair of lashes ever I'm really
into really bold intense lashes like
something that's a little more crazier
than this but of course these are pretty
and I think they're gonna look really
really really nice on a lot of different
eyes and a lot of different eye shapes
so I think for the lip I'm gonna do
something really really very and intense
this is the new colour-pop ultra satin
lip in the shade stud and this is from
their new Holiday Collection coming up
so I want to do this shade on the lip
and see what we hang that's beautiful
okay we're gonna do that I love their
ultra satin lips oh oh she's filling her
 oh it's bitch and that is it you
guys that's it for today's entire fall
to toriel using things that aren't as
expensive as other options and I hope
you guys enjoyed today's video this is
the look is how it turned out to be if I
can do anything and change anything it
would be the lashes I would get a little
bit more of an intense pair of lashes
but other than that I think that the
look turned out absolutely amazing and I
think we did a great great job
and I hope I did you guys some justice
on it today's look if you guys want to
see me using the morphe 35o two again or
anything here in today's video again if
you guys want to see another drugstore
video let me know for fall and I would
definitely make it happen do not forget
