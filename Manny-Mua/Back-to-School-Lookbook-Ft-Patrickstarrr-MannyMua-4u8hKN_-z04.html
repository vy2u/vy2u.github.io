probably the most different video I've
ever done it is a lookbook with Smashbox
I thought it was seriously one of the
funnest things to ever do as what I
think Smashbox cosmetics but like
hosting me and Patrick to do a lookbook
there that was seriously so crazy it was
like the weirdest experience like it was
the first time I ever films in front of
like people I don't do that i film in my
room like this is my little brothers
middle homes my little space like I
don't feel in front of people so it was
really nerve-wracking to film in front
of 10 people just staring at you while
you're feeling like while you're doing
things and I'm like what are you looking
at so so I wanna say thank you to
Smashbox cosmetics for that I hope you
guys enjoyed it it's different for me
it's probably a shortest video I've ever
uploaded ever

you who think that I talk too much and
that my videos are too long you're
welcome

lookbook I just I was super fun to do
and I really wanted to include it in my
videos and I want to say thank you again
to Smashbox for allowing me to do that
and thank you guys for allowing me to do
it - I feel like you guys are the ones
that pushes brands to recognize people

boy doing it and so I want to say thank
you to my followers for allowing me to
have these opportunities that I have I
do things for you guys and I xx nice to
