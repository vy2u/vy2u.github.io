so basically what happened was as I
posted on Twitter that I may or may not
post my 2014 beauty favorites of the
year and a lot of people were like oh my
god you need to post it and I was just
thinking I was like should I like I
don't like my favorites videos don't do
like that well my channel so I'm just
like oh maybe like I'll just skip past
it was so many people requested me to do
a face video of 2014 a beauty favorites
video of 2014 so I figured let's just
freakin do it manual let's freaking jump
into it let's start this because
obviously this videos about me I'm
 along this time I guess who
already knows it'd be so long like oh
shoot my ass like I fumble all my words
and I probably have to dump my memory
card like to be tiny like you know but
um yeah so just go ahead and get started
with these favorites that we're having
at this moment in time probably guys
like this video and that's all like it
don't watch it you know the
drill with that let's get started let's
go and order in the house the first
thing we're gonna do is we're gonna
start with something with skincare so
remember this is like my whole year so
the first one is my face wash that I
used all year and all like last year
this is just my trying to a face wash of
all time its purity
my philosophy it has very minimal
fragrance its natural it's a one-set
facial cleanser it's absolutely amazing
a lot of people use this with their
Claire sonics I use it personally with
my Clarisonic as well I think this is
just one of those amazing face watches
that takes off everything it's so good
for your skin it's for all skin types
and it's just the best cleanser I've
ever used could take it literally takes
off everything you guys it takes off
freaking everything and kind of things
my eyes a little bit if I get it inside
so don't get in your eyes but honestly
like this is one of the best countries
I've ever used my entire life a lot of
people talk about this for a good reason
and it's really not that expensive this
is this one's brand-new because I store
up during combat Friday because I always
sell it that's a fourth like ten bucks
so me my mom into buying twelve of them
so that's a ton and yeah so I'm
gonna be good and set for a whole year
so pure Nia is amusing the second
skincare I don't want to be talking
about is I mentioned this before in in
previous favorites video is the ultra
Repair Cream by first a beauty this
moisturizer is absolutely so good and
the reason I'm talking about it is
because it's a intensely moisturizing
face cream and it's a moisturizer but
it's so so so dense
it feels like it could be a cream it's
extremely hydrating I use it during the
day can I use it during the night mostly
towards the night I'll use more of it
because it's so so so hatching and I
don't want my skin to be oily throughout
the day it's just one of those
moisturizers that I think everyone would
absolutely love and it's easily these
are both well these items are found
inside Sephora so it's easier for you to
give you guys his hands on and you could
also get samples of them just in case
you guys were kind of nervous or
skeptical about trying skincare items I
know I get skeptical let's get care item
so I always try things first but for me
I don't really have that most sensitive
skin but I know a lot of people do so I
think that these would be absolutely
amazing for you if you were looking for
a really great moisturizer that's
extremely hydrating very cheap this is
six ounces of gin seventy grams for $28
is like you really ought to see you
can't beat that for the the quality
you're getting it's so absolutely
amazing and same with purity like this
this size of this is the 12 fluid ounces
I got for 10 bucks on Black Friday but
you can usually get it for 26 it's a
great deal so I would definitely goes
out if you looking for really great
skincare items for people with all skin
types great gifts great gift so
I'm just laying in okay so foundations
that have been loving of 2014 are three
so first one of course is my Double Wear
Estee Lauder de Bourgh I started I
started using this I absolutely fell in
love with it and the reason I love it so
much is because when they say Double
Wear stay in place makeup it really does
stay in place you put it on you buff it
out you don't even need to use like a
powder to set it it sets by itself sets
like a demi matte finish it's meant for
more people with more on the oily
combination side rather than people with
dry skin it's gonna be a little bit too
drying for you guys in my opinion if you
are dry but it gives amazing coverage
I'll link previous favourites videos
down below if you guys are interested in
them so because I want to go into what
you detail this video is already gonna
be a long ass long so yeah I
say a lot of work the next foundation
I'm like complete almost done with this
I wanted to keep it anyway though is the
NARS sheer glow foundation um I got this
at what I was wearing when I still
worked at Sephora and I use like it's
like completely gone like I use I used
to be so obsessed with the Narsha glow
foundation it's absolutely amazing even
despite me being more on the oily side I
still love this because it gave me such
great coverage it gave me such a nice
luminous glow I mean it wasn't a
luminous it just give me a nice glow to
the skin to live me my skin look very
healthy at great-great-great medium to
full buildable coverage
it's absolutely amazing it just it's a
great foundation it's kind of pricey
it's like 42 bucks like it's hell it's
when so I got this for free when I was
at Sephora for gratis I'm in the color
Fiji there's a shear mat foundation
there's a sheared glow even for me
despite me like more of a matte finish
with my foundations and me being more on
the oily side I think that the sheer
glow worked a lot better for me than the
sheer Mac did so how check them out
check it out my explanation is the
studio fix powder by Mac honestly this
is one of those like love and hate kind
of things for me when I first started
out using makeup like in the beginning
of this year like I went through like
four Studio Fix powder like it would
kind of clog my pores and I would be
much more like like this is
heavy hands but looking back like what
I'm looking at my stuff and I was like
you know what like this is 2014
favorites video it's not a favorite
video of the moment this used to be my
absolute obsession I still love this I
packed this on like
hardcore and I'm wearing a little bit
today just a little bit to set my makeup
and I remember how much I loved this
foundation in the past and so it gives a
nice medium to full coverage it's just a
powder it's a powder and foundation
combined you can find it I'm Mac I'm in
color NC 25 I'm not much too much detail
about this but I'm already like a pen on
this one too if there's sensitive a lot
of people Mac phoenicians kind of tricky
with Mac people so um it just kind of
depends like if you're really sensitive
of your skin a lot of people don't
really like Mac foundations for their
sensitive skin with this one
specifically like if you're more on the
dry side I would not use this because it
will pick up on your dry patches but it
works great for me because I'm Morel
combo oily and it gave me a really great
coverage but this like with this
foundation it lets you so it's like very
much it's not like a demi mad so I like
this cute like little like oh look at
that glow to the skin this isn't like
that this will give you a mad
ass your man is hail no
dimension to the face like completely no
dimension like I had to do like every
time I did this I had to be like 6 plus
like drenched in 6 bucks just to make it
look like bare ibly normal its $27 so
it's not too bad on the price point wise
it's that way cheaper than the two other
foundations I love and it's a lot more
accessible yeah try this guy out I think
that those Studio Fix powder is really
it's great foundation it really is like
I'm not sure I thought she said about it
but all that people don't like the
pseudo fix powder and Studio Fix like
Matt Klein for a lot of reasons and I
understand why so try it out if you guys
are not I get it
my holy grail concealer of Justin 14 is
the Mac Pro longer nw20 concealer it's
absolutely amazing
full-coverage it's very liquidy it's not
mysticus at all it gives you an amazing
amazing amazing finish it gives like a
demi matte finish and it's absolute
amazing it covers all covered Ayres
Delaney and get cover like it's so good
another thing too that I love to use as
far as I used to prime my eyelids I used
to put my headlights today for the
makeup I'm wearing and a lot of people
always ask me like what primer do you
use I use the Mac Pro Longwear concealer
my primary it's a such a good primer
it's such a good base as long as you
don't use too much of it that's the real
important part you cannot use too much
of this or a will bunch and it will
crease just like any other concealer
will but it's absolutely amazing
especially for like you're being like 20
bucks I think like I've gone through
like three of these in 2014 so I would
definitely check out the Mac Pro more
can see that a lot of people talk about
this one for a good reason it's
absolutely amazing it's my favorite
concealer of all time
oh my cheap product list
it's not it's not to change that's not
really beginning of the year okay I
really got into contouring and
highlighting and things like that for in
2014 what I would say is invest in
contra pallets my favorite one number
one always is going to be the a massage
and Beverly Hills contour palette
they're original it's not this one I
didn't pick out this is just one of
those ones I think it's sold exactly
like this and I got it like this I
absolutely love it I've used all the
colors I am very almost done with banana
and it's an absolutely great great great
great palette for probably from white to
like medium deep skin tones this is an
absolutely great palette for you guys if
you are interested in another kind of
contour palette I would try to check out
the morphe one the morphe one is this is
what the morphe one looks like it's a
lot lot lot bigger and a lot cheaper but
I suppose you want is $40 and this one
is I believe $18 I think I could be
wrong don't call me don't you
call me on that it's absolutely
amazing they're extremely extremely
extremely extremely pigmented they're so
like I just like it's extremely favorite
I think it's absolutely great and that
same same thing applies but this one I
feel even more so you can go from like
light all the way to darker in
complexion I also have a code with
morphe mani anyway in all caps
it's a tiny baby Commission code I make
a little bit off of it nothing too crazy
but of course I would appreciate it if
you guys used my code towards it but
don't think that because I have a code
that I'm plugging this product in any
way shape or form it's absolutely
amazing and so so worth the money I've
talked about this
previous favorites video I think was my
November favorites 2014 it's so good
it's not even like then I make me seem
like one like fan myself I'm hot
like biggie buddy I loves contouring and
highlighting for 2014 so check out
either of them both are absolutely
amazing you wanting to go more towards
like the like lower price point check
out the morphe you want and if you've
not check out the uh Nastasia contour
kit sold in sight Sephora sold them say
more feet in burbank cool mean so let's
go and talk about bronzers bronzers for
2014 work good to me very good to me I
know that Jean Quan solo first one I
ever fell in love with was from Mac it's
the carrot blend powder in dark which
looks like this I've hit pan it's an
absolutely amazing amazing amazing
bronzer and the reason I love it so much
it's a very neutral bronzer and it's
actually it's a face powder it's not
meant to be a bronzer but there is not
like this as a bronzer is because it's
meant to match someone's face it's not
too cool talk too warm it's not too
heavy as a bronzer it won't turn orange
on you and that's the reason why I love
this one so so so much it's because it
was very neutral for me and Jacqueline
Hill was actually the first person ever
talked about this for me so I went out
and I bought it and i felt absolutely
fell in love with it has great
recommendations for products if you ever
need to learn about how good products go
watch Chuck in those video she's
absolutely amazing
Caitlyn powder in dark for my complexion
is absolutely amazing
another bronzer is the girl acting
beauty cabo bronzer which looks like
this i talked about this tonight
December favorites videos so I'm not
gonna really bring it up so much and
this one I just wanted to mention it
again because even though I just
recently got it was in like in November
I tell them that it's so hard when
wearing it today it's this bronzer isn't
the been like by my sign and all time
and phloem good I'm not sure really sure
how much they are I'll leave a link down
below but it's so pigmented it's so
creamy
it's absolutely it just feels like
velvet to the skin it gives you this
beautiful you can't even really tell
unless it's right here see that how very
neutral that is like it's just beautiful
neutral bronzed glow to the skin it's a
matte with the slight slight slight
sheen to it you can even see in the in
the thingy house has a small like tiny
baby sheen I don't know if you can
 see that
I don't think you can but honestly it's
absolutely absolutely amazing especially
if you're a boy if you're a boy watching
my channel that may be like wearing
makeup but they don't want to be too
heavy like
the bronzer you don't want to be so
obvious I would definitely try combo
bronzer biker lactic it's absolutely
amazing I talked about it before
cool so blush rich with symbolism first
blush we talked about as a first blush I
ever felt really fell in love with which
is actually MAC Cosmetics warm soul
opens whore it looks like this it's this
peachy gold color it's very very very
light though I'm actually wearing on my
cheeks today it's oh it's so beautiful
it's more like one the first blushes I
ever just like became obsessed with it
looks like this you really wanna see
like you can see that if you are darker
in complexion I wouldn't really
gravitate towards this mm see you guys
I'm just because I think it could again
look possibly a living one actually side
this gives you this warm golden peachy
glow to the skin I think it's absolutely
amazing it's just one of those blushes
you guys like this one like you will
always be obsessed with because it's so
good Spencer from battle actually used
to rave about this blush all the time in
and I fell in with it so Thank You
Samantha
from my lash for introducing that
to me cuz oh camper thank you so
next next blushes we're gonna talk about
our I've also again mentioned them in a
favorites video oh my god that's too
bright in this case so cute like stop
this is a Z palette format it's by
Sherry Jesse it's actually her own
artwork and it's a little Z palette so
cute right I love it she send it to me
Thank You Shari so my blushes of choice
this is not much but our by makeup geek
which are infatuation and spellbound of
course I've talked about these in my
November favorites video before because
they're so so so good ever since I've
had make a big blushes they are
obscenely beautiful and I always use a
meet together I never really use them
separately um infatuation is this like
nice warm burnt orange color looks like
this it has like a lot of peach to it
and then the spellbound has a lot more
on the rosey pinky side I've talked
about that in previous video I don't
want to bring it up again but they're
absolutely amazing um make it be blushes
service uh they're made so well they're
so creamy they're so pigmented I
absolutely love them and then also again
as a favorites for the whole year I'm
wearing it today is the Mac emphasize
highlighting powder this is a pro item
but you could still order I know you can
still get it if you order it online it's
a pro item no you can't find it every
single Mac's store but they're sculpting
powder and emphasize is absolutely so
beautiful I'm wearing it today as
and I know probably real
highlight it like you're only greatly
highlighted but I love I love this like
light and I look and it's not like
people like again I've talked about
before but when you like swatch it and
you put on the skin it doesn't look like
white it gives you like this glow
it's like glow to the skin it's just the
weirdest thing but it's absolutely
amazing emphasize highlighting powder by
Mac I love the sculpting powders by Mac
in general so yeah my highlight of 2014
my favorite highlighter of all time of
2014 is definitely definitely ever I
talked about it in my video the December
favorites is Becca highlighter in opal
the reason I'm talking about the Becca
highlighter in opal I have moonstone I
have opal I'm wearing both of my cheeks
today opal is gonna be definitely more
of a universal highlight for more people
moonstone is very cool very silver in
tone opals a lot more warm and so I
think that for you guys if you guys are
interested in something like this it's
extremely extremely shimmery like do not
get me wrong the thing with the becca
highlighters is that it gives you a very
obvious like glow to the skin it's not
like those subdued like hourglass
ambient lighting tena highlights a lot
of people love those kind of highlights
but I personally like highlights are
like this that are much more intense and
I don't think it just gives you really
natural glow to the skin and I think
that they're really proud of their soul
tonight Sephora if you guys are curious
you get them at site Sephora okay so the
next little subject area where you talk
about is brushes of 2004 seen some with
face ones
okay so face ones of 2014 are definitely
definitely definitely my first number
one of course is gonna be kabuki brushes
specifically flat top kabuki 's I've
talked about these so many times and I
use them in almost all my tutorials and
I think they're absolutely amazing I
think that kabuki brushes in general get
the most beautiful airbrushed finish
even if it's a dense foundation you can
really buff them out and give you this
most beautiful like airbrushed finish to
the skin I think those are beautiful and
I love love love love that kind of
effect so specifically the ones that I
love love love are the Sigma f80 flat
top kabuki and the morphe M 439 I love
them both so much I've been using them
or if you want a little bit more and so
I like this one a little bit more you
know like I'm not gonna like it's a lot
bigger it's just every buffs out nicely
I'm not really defend the biggest fan of
like paddle foundation brushes where it
gives you like that streak I don't
really like that so if you guys are
interested in any kind of flat top
kabuki or kabuki brushes in general
I would definitely check out these
sigma1 and be morphine when they are
beautiful and they're synthetic fibers
and because there's synthetic fibers
they don't harbor bacteria as much as a
natural hair brush would so I think that
that's definitely definitely definitely
a great thing because these kind of
brushes soak up foundation they do like
even despite the being synthetic they
still soaked up foundation every brush
will sort of soak up foundation no
matter what but if they're synthetic
they don't harbor bacteria nearly as
much so I think that's a really really
really really really good my ultimate
contour brush of this year oh my god
it's so good to me it was the makeup
geek round blush brush I've talked about
this in my December favorites video so
I'm not gonna really go into much too
much detail by trying to reiterate how
absolutely amazing amazing this brush is
it's so good for contouring it's so
precise it just gives you this nice line
it buffs out beautifully like a dream
like a dream I swear to God last
one of the face brushes is gonna be the
morphe m4 38 it's so so good at setting
my under eye concealer I use it to
highlight I use it for absolutely
everything I talked about this brush so
many times and for a good reason this is
just one of the best brushes I've ever
ever ever ever used for highlighting and
for giving me like a nice glow to the
skin so morphe m4 39 for 38 so good also
obviously like I have the cover morphe
like you're also getting 10% off the
brushes so that's pretty cool in my
opinion fall and so I have four eye
brushes for of course the whole year and
so the first two I'm going to talk about
because they're the first two luxurious
kind of brushes I ever bought they are
the Sigma e-40 and the Sigma e25 I used
to use these brushes so so so so so much
these mean a lot to me because they're
the first Sigma brushes I ever bought
and when I first started watching Jaclyn
he'll be used to weren't used these
brushes all the time and so I bought
them with our recommendation and I used
them in almost every single tutorial
I've ever done and every single makeup
look I've ever done because they're so
good especially the e-40 40 I just can't
live without like it's just it's so good
to me it's a natural hair brush see the
e25 is so great at packing and blending
which I love and the Sigma e-40 is so
great at buffing out any color of
eyeshadow so thank you Jacqueline again
for recommending these two this is when
I first started getting into makeup like
two years ago and now I'm gonna
affiliate with Sigma it's just it's so
crazy
so crazy the things that you can you can
accomplish if you set your mind to
things so these rice is just me a lot
the next two are gonna be again this the
segment go six the reason I'm bringing
up the segments you know six is because
this could easily be the one of the best
eyeliner brushes I've ever used in my
entire life you can't even barely see it
because it's so tiny
it's actually an angled brush I don't if
you can tell but it turns into the most
thinnest line and I use this literally
like it all my tutorials like I just
like my wing turns out to be so good and
absolutely every single in my tutorials
and it's just so easy to use with this
brush I don't know if it sold out this
brush is always sold out on Sigma so
hopefully it's not white when you guys
see this it's so good it's so good oh my
god the last person I'm gonna talk about
is the more freehand 433 the reason I
love this brush is because it reminds
you so much of the Mac 217 as well as
the Sigma e25 this brush is that like
white go hair brush that's absolutely
amazing at placing color and buffing it
out as well this one is so cheap tell
the reason that's why I'm ringing up is
because not only is it great and I love
it love it love it love it
it's literally like you can get a five
$5 I'm not I'm kidding it's more like
four dollars I don't even know but for a
brush to be $4 and work well just like
the Sigma e25 in the Mac 217
I like the Sigma e25 a little bit more
than I like this one I'm not gonna lie
but for the fact that the Sigma e25 is
like what what 15 bucks and this is for
like you just it you can't like this
cannot be beat in price and quality it
cannot be beat at all they don't shed
amazing brush when you gotta yell at me
oh so this is gonna be such a bitch to
any cuz it's gonna be so long I
can already feel it in my thumbs we're
now we're gonna talk about eye stuff the
first palette I ever really fell in love
with of this too of 2014 is the Too
Faced chocolate bar palette looks like
this one here this palette is just it's
absolutely amazing it's sold inside
Sephora smells like freakin chocolate
the colors that I want to be matte and I
want to use as transitions like this
color in this color and this color there
Matt you know what I mean and so you get
such a good array of colors and this and
it's like for 48 bucks like I said what
I love these more than every single
Naked palette put together I'm not
kidding I don't think that's a chocolate
bar palette it's so great so Universal
it's very warm to me and I kind of like
that warmish tone so if you guys
interested in a palette that's really
great if the
easy to find some type support and
especially if you're like really
starting to get into makeup and you're
like oh my god I want to try and palette
but I don't know kind of don't want to
get go for the Too Faced palette it is
so good the chocolate bar product like I
could you know it's so quiche
and Sarki Sh
that's quiche so next time talk about
you talk about a couple of them is the
makeup geek eyeshadows 2014 I discovered
makeup geek I bought some of her eye
shadows when I was a famous bow for the
first time and I bought three colors and
I fell in love with making peak right
away it was like oh my god I love you
shadows so so so much they're absolutely
amazing and then I also bought two of
their pigments in utopia and insomnia
still due to my favorite pigments that
they ever ever ever created these
shadows are so creamy so amazing the
only $6 seriously like I don't even know
how that they sell it for this price
point it's just it's it's mind-blowing
the ones that are my favorites right now
are beaches and cream cocoa bear bitten
and shimmer mission but I don't even
need to like look in the back I know
these colors my heart because they're
actually amazing
they mean a lot to me because - because
when I was starting out Marlene ever you
talked to me because apparently her team
they liked my youtube videos they liked
my Instagram they thought that I was a
really like cool guy and Marlina and
send me a message on Twitter and she was
like hi you like you seem really cool I
want to reach out to you and so now I
can honestly say Marley's where my
closest friends and it's just it's so
crazy to me like 2014 that I bought her
stuff I'm famous bow when I was there
and I loved it from the beginning and I
loved everything that her brand stood
for and then now I'm gonna be hanging
out with Marlena when I'm in LA coming
up like it's just it's absolutely crazy
and Martin he just means a lot to me as
well I will always stand behind this
brand no matter what Marlene is one of
the first people one of the first
friends to ever really take me under
their wing and really give me advice and
really just believe in me and believe my
arm believed my in my personality so I
will always always always have her to
thank for that and it may give you ever
wanted to do a pallet with me oh sweet
may be Lord Jesus Christ do you know I'm
a dual - hallelujah
last but not least actually laughs my
favorite and my favorite part of the
video is definitely lip products lip
products are at my apps
like bread and butter I love the
products I love lip liners I love
lipsticks I love lip glosses i
absolutely love lip products they're my
favorite and I love them like I
want to push my camera that's how much I
love them you know first things first we
talk about okay obviously like we need
we this needs to be addressed
it just has to meet so um my favorite
lip liner of all life um all-time and I
will never I'm pretty sure I will never
find a lip liner that I love as much as
this lip lip liner it's the NYX peekaboo
neutral lip liner it's the most perfect
flawless color of all time when it comes
to lip liners it's so perfect it's this
pinky Mavi brown color it has a lot more
pink to it the camera is picking up a
little bit more on the brown side but it
has a lot more pinte I'm wearing this
lip liner today and it's just so good
it's so good like I don't even know how
to express how good it is I use it in
almost all my tutorials and I will
continue use it almost all my tutorials
especially if you're going for more like
a nude lip or more of a pinky lip this
lid but it just works with absolutely
everything
it's besides red and like purple and
stuff like that but everything that's
more than natural cycle more for the
pinky more of the new dish kind of
colors this applied networks for it and
it's like three dollars I've gone
through literally a kitchen I've gone
through I think five of these lip liners
and it gets me nervous because I keep
talking about this a planner so I know
that some people are like oh my god like
just bought next beauty neutral lip
liner sold out here it sold out online
and I'm like you guys you guys can't
sell this you guys can't sell this out
like you cannot this needs to be my lip
liner of all time so whatever I find it
in a store if I have I literally buy all
of them like last time I bought the last
three not the that the Ulta had I bought
the last three and this is my last one
so don't next lid product my favorite
favorite favorite lip stick from Mac of
all time is Mac kind of sexy lipstick
this is my 2014 favorite lipstick of Mac
it's so good it looks like the color I'm
wearing right now basically if I'm being
straight up on a peachy pink matte lip
shade looks like this it's literally my
favorite lipstick from Mac of all time
ever and it looks good on so many
different skin tones like literally like
depending on the lip liner used with it
of course it looks good on so many
people it's just absolutely beautiful if
you guys like Mac lips
six that are like the tone that I'm
wearing right now I check out the MAC
lipstick and kind of sexy it's so good
to me and I swear this literally emic
all day very day it gels 14 I discovered
George cosmetics gerard cosmetics
lipsticks oh they're so good I love them
I love it I could talk about all of them
but I'm only gonna talk about two so the
ones I love that are my absolute
favorite are nude and Buttercup the
reason I like them is because they are a
matte lipstick but they're much more
like the creamy cider they're not
dehydrating whatsoever but they still
give you a matte finish which is
something I love about lipsticks like
this Buttercup is a little bit more
creamy I would say than the nude color
is it's definitely more has more of a
sheen to it definitely than nude but
still nonetheless absolute amazing let
me swatch them oh my god I forgot how
much I love nude holy shitballs damn
 balls
so we have nude and we have buttercup
they look kind of similar in this
lighting
but buttercup is a lot more creamy it's
a lot more pastel lot more pink this one
has a lot more orangie beige tone to it
then this one they're both absolutely
amazing I love them so much but I also
wanted to talk about my favorite gloss
that they actually carry it's
buttercream by 2r cosmetics it looks
like this I'll swatch it right next to
buttercup literally just once watched
you guys ever die like they're so
pigmented
this is buttercream lip gloss as you can
tell it's a gloss but it's an extremely
extremely extremely extremely pigmented
gloss then what I love about the glosses
is that they are very pigmented they're
not too sticky but they last all day I
don't know how they did it work
they're not like extremely sticky and
usually like the extremely extremely
extremely sticky glosses will last all
day because they're so sticky
but these an are not sticky my favorites
are buttercream and nude and with the
lipsticks my favorites are buttercup and
nude
um they're long but yeah those are my
absolute favorite I actually do have a
code with Gerard it's funny because I
already had I already have my normal
code Gerard which is Manny anyway which
you get 25% off the entire site I also
have my mani lip combo with George which
you get to pick three lipsticks of your
choice for 29 bucks which is so good
because originally that let's just
select $18 each I think but my discount
discounts them all the way down to $10
apiece so I think that's absolutely
amazing and now I actually have a new
code with them and
with him and it's called Manny for you
what's caught this coat I'm and I think
that the reason I wanted to talk about
this code with them and the reason I
approached them with this code is
because people love lipsticks but a lot
of people love glasses as well and so
the cool thing about this code is that
you pick four items of your choice of
any gloss any lipstick and it's gonna be
$39 so no matter what you make some
getting four items it could be four
glosses it can be four lipsticks it
could be two glasses two lipsticks and
you're getting it for $39 no matter what
and I think it's such a good deal it's
just it's it's so good like you I think
each glass is $22 or 24 I can't remember
but for example so if you wanted to get
four glosses you get for 39 books and I
just think that's such a crazy amazing
amazing deal especially for the quality
of Gerard so what you want to do is you
want to go to the drawing site for this
for this thing and you for this deal so
you go to the droid site and then you go
to the for what is it why don't we go to
let's look online can't remember found
it okay so what it is it's the way to go
to the drawer cosmetic site so you click
Beauty bundles you go down to the spot
where says just for you it'll say that
you click that bundle and you pick four
of the classes or four of the lipsticks
or four of the items that you want to
pick type in mani for you like many ma
and then Y for y you so the the just for
you like originally it's seventy six
dollars originally so it just comes you
into thirty nine dollars so that is a
huge discount I don't know what it is
exactly I think it's like forty seven
percent or something like that
discounted so I think it's a really
really really really really great deal
George was one of the brands this year
that really another just like makeup
geek were they took me under the wing
and they did so they were just so so so
good to me and the products are
absolutely amazing and I just think that
Jen Gerard she's just one of the most
amazing people I've ever met in my
entire life she's oh my god Asia here
like how I cracked when I got in
emotional I think that us really check
out the drawing stuff there the quality
is absolutely amazing like I don't it's
so good it's so good I love them love
them love you Jordan amazing amazing I'm
imaging try it out you guys will I know
you for a fact you guys will not be to
support
that's all you guys won't be
disappointed at all my accent is so
terrible so yes now it's the entire 2014
beauty favorites of the year hopefully
you guys enjoyed this video I had a
great time making it um I know this is
gonna be so long I know it's and used to
bitch to sit through this stuff because
it's so long and I think this might be
like a forty minute video I kid you not
it could be 40 to 50 to 60 minutes I
have no idea when it's going weak I
think it's great so see for people that
are just starting out in the beauty
world that wanted to know favorites of
other Beauty people and I think that
these are these are favorites of mine
that worked so well for me some of these
packs were sent to me some things I
bought myself a etc etc I don't want you
guys to think that just because I had
received a product from a brand that it
lessens the merit of how good the brand
is like once you start getting hiring
numbers you get sent bright like you get
sent products from so many brands like
you do not like the I know people I
guess said NARS Urban Decay Mac like
they get sent so many products because
that's their jobs is to review products
like that so I apologize to you guys
again like a lot of people they'll kind
of like hassle me because I don't use
too many drugstore products right don't
use too many products that I say I buy I
personally just think that it's better
for me to tell you guys that I will send
the product I don't know what everyone
around you guys and say like well I went
out and bought this product myself when
I did in so I think that's really
important like I want to keep it real
keep it 100 with you guys um once I'm at
a better like spot in my life with my
channel and with things like that I'll
be able to go out and buy more things
but right now I just stopped working a
Mac so it's not going to happen
yet oh yeah I just want you guys to bear
with me I think the reason I use the
products that are sent to me is because
they're so good you guys should see that
amount of stuff I have that I never
touch it's just I mean I it I have but I
never use it because I don't believe in
the product honestly like what I can say
in my last favorite if 2014 would be you
guys my YouTube babies my Instagram
babies um it's just so so so so crazy to
see like how my life has changed 2014
2014 has been the biggest life-changing
year of my entire life I started my
Instagram ten months ago
and I would have never known my wildest
dreams that it would be to this level
where I have 150,000 Instagram followers
and over a hundred thousand
on YouTube and it's just the craziest
theme and it just goes to show like like
nothing is unattainable if you guys try
and you guys work hard and just one of
those things if you guys just show
yourself to the world and you wanna
forgiving and you're just doing your own
thing you don't give a what other
people say it will pay back tenfold and
I really hope you guys get that for my
channel and I absolutely love you guys
so much and you guys are so good to me
and I hope that you guys feel that good
to you guys too and I love you so much
and I can't even begin to explain how
much I do and I don't want to talk about

cry and I will know how my channel um
