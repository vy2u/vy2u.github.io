so as soon as magic walk octoman ii
thrown into the convention it was like
screaming and crazy and madness doctor

in general it was just crazy so he
walked and finally got to the pink
carpet and we took photos of that people
were screaming and it was just so crazy
amazing I'll go ahead and add a clip in
here
Jason see what the experience was like
it was absolutely insane we finished
that we got to go to the back I got to
meet so many people that I've been
wanting to me for so long and just like
people that I look up to and people that
are just in the beauty community who I
think I've done so well for themselves
including Kenny Johnson she was so
amazing like Kenny Johnson is just as
amazing if she is in video as she's in
person like she's so personable she's so
crazy she's so fun she's just so vibrant
I love her oh my god I need Kesey holmes
who's absolutely beautiful in person -
she's just like this real-life Barbie
she has cute little accent I just wanted
to pick her up and just like throw her
in the air and catch her and like just
put her into my bosom like she was just
usually the cutest little thing ever
I finally got me Joseph Harwood who I
was so excited to meet because he was so
sickening
he's another boy that does makeup who I
love you know I've been loving my boys
who do makeup oh my god I got a mean
graveyard girl bunny great girl I gotta
meet her
she was sick I mean we got to meet her
um me and Patrick went to the tart booth
and we saw bunny there and so we gotta
meet her and talk to her for a little
bit it was just absolutely crazy it was
when he was trying to get to the tar
booth wasn't that easy well literally Oh
My Lord Jesus breath getting to the tar
booth was not easy for me and Patrick we
had security guards we had our friend
Christina she was there with us it was
so in sane trying to get touched our
booth because people were like screaming
and trying to meet us and it was fun I
loved it I loved every single minute of
the screaming of madness and the
craziness
I loved it even if you got too crazy
sometimes what you did I was like right
now getting guitar booth was it was it
was tough but we got there it was fine
getting out of the tar booth
that is another story
Lord people started to realize that me
and Patrick we're at the tart booth and
they're like seeing us and so like we're
basically in the tart booth and people
are surrounding the booth like 360
status because me and Patrick we're in
there with a girl
meaning I wanted to kind of go out and
just kind of like see the vendor see
things like that we just wanted to go
out and see what was going on we didn't
really know what kind of response we
were gonna be getting because I mean
it's Texas I've never been in Texas
before I didn't know I even had
followers in Texas had no idea but as
soon as we left the room that we were in
it was a little as a man so we're
meaning we're trying to devise a plan
with our security and weren't ok cool so
what are we gonna do we're in this tower
booth we're gonna we need to get back to
the room
they're like you know it's okay it's
okay let's do this we're gonna go out
we're gonna go so basically we have
security in front some security in the
back me and Patrick you know and our
fingers you know is there kind of
recording so basically we got we finally
got out of the tart booth and we were
and security was like trying to like I'm
just like protect us you know you know
we're in our little bubble at one point
my ass got left behind in the crowd or
Patrick in the security in Christina all
went forward and he was getting
protected while my ass is over here in a
crowd of people like there he's
surrounding me and I'm like the tallest
bitch I'm like him like the Brady thing
at the end flow but I get their flow in
and it was just not happening for me I
honestly like it was crazy it was scary
and I was like getting bombarded but it
was so fine like there was one point
like my ass was getting grabbed some was
trying to got my shirt my like my blue
shirt my taint was grabbed at one two
point in height if you know what aeneas
look a up
it was ground and touch and crest and I
was just like I don't even dress area do
you know it's literally kind of both
ways you wanna you wanna just jump into
the air and crowd surfing just be like
yeah but other at the same time you want
to be like safe and not like it caressed
or imparted by any type of person but it
was so insanely amazing it's funny cuz
like the whole time I'm laughing and I'm
just like enjoying the whole thing
people are trying to pictures with me
I'm like yes man she has to take photos
like it was so insane like it was just
so crazy dude finally like we got back
to the room we were okay
nothing happened to us we were like
we're fine we're just chillin there we
had our panel soon so we're just kinda
like breathing and eating solar panels
coming up and I was so nervous I've
never been to a panel before I've never
done panel and the panel was best
friends in real life panel which is with
me and Patrick because we're best
friends in real life as well as online
don't try to in tonight you Patrick
I know you're watching this video and I
know your turn tonight we're best
friends really excel in the panel we are
with four other people
yeah about to go honestly I really know
much about their blogs or vlogs or
anything like that they were really
really really really popular girls all I
know is that they're extremely popular I
don't really watch that kind of vlogging
style i watch more like beauty gurus and
stuff like that so I'm not really sure
if who they were necessarily I've seen
any videos of theirs but I don't like
follow them religiously or anything like
that like I do other people so sorry if
you guys do know where they are and
they're gonna like comment be like why
the do you not know who that bitch
is we have we went on with them the
panel was so amazing it was just so
overwhelming just to be there
the comparative it's not because like
this what we do is so rare it's it's so
rare to find another friend and you know
it's all or nothing either I'm gonna
compete with you and lose our friendship
or I'm gonna take it and this is a first
for me and I'm and it's just so surreal
to be here and we're doing it together
and it just makes it so so so awesome
because our styles and videos ourselves
of photos themselves everything is
completely different so like being in so
amazing and so large and so great so
that's I think our style is just very
different and I think there's no
competition in the best friend like
after the panel was done they have to be
tunnels down it was just so like I was
just so overwhelmed because I cannot
even believe the kind response I came
from people you forget you honestly
forget that you have so many people that
fall you would want to communicate with
you and be your friend and I loved it I
absolutely loved it so much but it just
when you're in an event like that it
just really humbles you to be like oh my
god like I have so many like just
friends right here and there and it's
just the most overwhelming feeling to be
able to be in that situation and see the
kind of love you get and it was so
amazing meeting you guys I got to meet
people after our panel we did a meet and
greet and we got to meet so many of you
guys it was just so amazing and then
afterwards I went along the rope just
try to meet you guys too there's like
this outside of the are backstage room
there was like a rope and I got to go
out there and just like talk to you guys
and meet you guys
it was so freakin amazing I just felt
like there was just so much support and
love in the room not only for me but for
everyone that was there and I'd want to
say a huge thank you to guys because I
never knew I could feel this kind of way
about someone or about people that I
never really had that I don't know
personally but I can honestly say you
guys haven't changed my life so much and
for the better it's just funny because
like being going to events like this it
makes me want to be a better person
for you guys just that makes want to
record more of a scene you want to
upload more for you guys because you
guys support me so much I just want to
support you guys so much more back I
love just going into the crowd and talk
to you guys and just hugging you guys
and kissing you guys and yes kissing you
guys a kiss call you on the cheek so
much I think a mouth kiss on me but I
was like and I was like no cuz I was
just so amazing and I'm back home in San
Diego now I just want to say how much I
love you guys and how much I appreciate
you guys I cannot wait for my next type
of convention I think the next one's
coming up is I'm at New York which the
he'll be at and then one after that I
think is gonna be famous beau LA it's
great to meet you guys in person because
I know what let you guys watch me and
yours come at me and we talk online but
it's completely different being able to
go up to someone and hug someone and
talk to you guys and you guys talk to me
and that one-on-one experience is just
so much more gratifying to me I know I
feel like I'm just like rambling on
about how much I love you guys but it's
just you guys have no idea how crazy it
was and how much I would like just was
so happy I was so happy to be there and
it's just the most overwhelming
experience I can't even explain I really
cannot ah man I love you guys so much
I really do dude I'm really dude
it's crazy but yeah that's it for the
video hopefully you guys enjoyed this
