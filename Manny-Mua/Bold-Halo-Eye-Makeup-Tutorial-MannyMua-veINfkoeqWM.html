shadow through the sunrays and
hey guys welcome back to my channel so
today is going to be a makeup tutorial
on this eye look I have going on right
now which is pretty sickening
I'm not gonna lie I really like how this
turned out
this is probably what my favorite looks
I've ever done because it's so dramatic
and so crazy and so out there I love the
crazy out there makeup you know it's not
like I'm not only into like just that
like dainty like average smoky eye like
remember I like the weird stuff too you
know I like the red liner and I like the
the weird makeup and I like the like
harder to wear makeup because I think
it's so fun you know I think that's like
my I love to challenge myself in that
way and I hope you guys do too I got so
much positive feedback on this look in
my favourites videos I decided to film
it for you guys because you guys were
like film that loved bitch film it so I
decided from if you guys you guys don't
like this video guys don't like me
please feel free to not watch it um
because I don't give a fine I don't but
if you guys do like this video and you
guys do like me please like this video
and subscribe to my channel if you guys
aren't already and if you're new to my
channel what's up Manny let's go ahead
and start with this video and let's get
this bitch going okay great so we're
gonna go and start this video I already
have my base on like I my foundation my
contour my highlight I just feel like
this look is all about the eye so I just
wanted to quickly rush through the face
I did that melt lipstick swatch video
and a lot of you guys were like do a
look with the dark matter stack or any
of the stacks from melt cuz they're
really good stacks and they have a great
shadows and I told you guys about them
so for this look I am gonna be using the
dark matter stack from melt
sooo I think so okay we're going to love
it so first we're gonna start off with
the shadow blur which is basically like
a nice little PG just neutral beige
color it's very similar to Peach
Smoothie and beaches and cream by makeup
geek which is like that nice transition
if you guys don't have these shadows
totally fine just kind of find the
equivalent that you guys do have I'm
gonna go and take a e27 morphe brush
another new elite brushes you guys know
the lead brushes are my favorite morphe
brushes that they came out with they're
so good I'm gonna go in toss that into
my crease my lids are already primed and
my brows already filled in just a heads
up cuz you guys are thinking what the
 are you doing no yeah I'm already
I'm already primed so I'm just gonna run
that into the crease it's such a pretty
transition color I absolutely love it
so nice just chill base I'm going to you
guys in a little
close I feel like you can't really see
but now I'm gonna go ahead mix unseen
and enigma these two colors right here
nice like neutral brown with a nice
really warm cranberry red but come on
red tone mixed with like a brown neutral
brown there's like my favorite and
literally just kind of kinky anything on
a morphe and four three three you guys
knows my favorite morphe brush basically
ever and i'm gonna put on the outer
corner i'm just kind of running on the
outer corner don't need to be too neat
with it but you do want to place it in
like a certain spot because this is
going to be like a halo I don't bring it
too far in just keep on the outer third
of your eye right up into the crease and
then do the same thing on the front of
the eye like the front third part as
well start on the lid and bring it up
into the crease it should look something
like this just by placing the color down
and now I'm going to go and make that
halo effect I'm not picking up any more
product I'm just literally lightly
blending from the first third in the
third third with no additional product
I'm just literally using whatever I have
left on the brush and I'm blending
across to make this nice halo effect and
keeping the center of the eye completely
barren then I'm gonna go and grab that
same key 27 buy more feet and blend out
the edges of those shadows they blend so
freakishly nicely I was like shocked
when I first use and I was like no no
and then go ahead and bring it out
slightly over here on the outer third so
now you have something like this has
like a nice warm cranberry Brown tone to
it it's so pretty it's nice and blended
I wanna see like this look is so simple
what you guys are gonna be like oh my
god don't anything I'm gonna be
like alright so now we have the base of
our halo I kind of done we're gonna
wanna take the shade dark matter which
is the black in this little quad now I'm
gonna take a very small amount of it
because it is extremely pigmented it is
such a good black on a more feet a 36
which is my favorite pencil brush above
oh damn huh you know that then we have a
code with morphe mani mu I get you 10%
off I'm just lucky I'm gonna fill it
with more for you guys know a lot of you
guys know this but love you guys don't
if you're new to my channel not only is
it my favorite brush brand of all time
but the honestly want my favorite
affiliates to be part of because they're
just good people you know more fees such
a good brand and they have such a good
quality and I'm just really proud to be
in Philly with them you know so now I
was gonna take that black I'm gonna take
it on the front right before the inner
corner I'm just gonna feather that
forward with my key 36 and then same on
the outer corner I'm gonna put it on the
outer corner feather it forward and then
we'll take that in 4 3 3 again and blend
out that black into the previous colors
just to make the transition a lot more
seamless
I'm more easy just doing circular
motions inside that spot I'll give you a
nice really pretty gradient this is all
I need to do for the halo part like the
halo high part is done the middle of my
eye is completely open and that's why
I'm going to be putting the glitter or
whatever we're gonna be using which is
later
you just want to remember to keep
blending throughout each step you know
what I mean you want it to be a very
seamless easy transition so it's kind of
the point of this whole thing
I use a two-faced glitter glue to go
ahead and put that all over the middle
part of the lid the only thing that's
shitty about this glitter glue is that
it will take off the product underneath
your eye because it's kind of sticky so
you have to be cautious of that like if
you have shadow underneath this it'll
take off the shadow and then the star of
the show which a lot of people have been
asking me about this glitter it's the
body sparkles silver buy-in glides like
one of the most gorgeous glitters I've
ever tried it like a 3d glitter from Mac
similar to that and then I'm gonna go
ahead and take a morph e320 and this is
just a really great precision packing
brush and that's what you really want to
do you want the glitter to be flying
everywhere you know what I mean so
that's why I'm going to use I'm just
gonna go into the glitter dust off the
excess just are pressing in the center
of my eye not going too far up just
where you put the glitter glue at and
you want to just put it on the mobile
lid you don't want it to be too far up
because then it's gonna transfer where
has your open social it's gonna be like
this if you notice that the glitter is
like not blended in it's a little bit
stark then you can't go and go back in
with that same blending brush and just
kind of go over the glitter slightly
without like messing with it too too too
much I'm gonna say it's hard to blend
the glitter obviously you just kind of
wanna be cautious and like blend around
it make it look a little bit more
seamless if that's what you want I'm
gonna go and finish the other one off
the camera real quick and I'll be right
back perfect now both of the eyes are
done this is what it looks like oh I'm
obsessed with this glit this glitter is
everything so now I'm gonna go ahead and
do the bottom of the eye on this side
I'm gonna go ahead and take enigma and
unseen one more time on my same you 36 I
wiped away the Dark Matter color from it
because it was like obviously black want
to run that underneath the eye on the
outer corner and then on the inner
corner as well I'll run keep a little
small baby space in the middle just
empty I'm gonna go and take the same
glitter glue and put that underneath
there a little baby about that face
though only mother could love
just for shits and giggles you don't
have to do this
I'm taking boom-boom room by Mac you
guys know this is like one of my
favorite dazzle shadows that they were
released and I told you guys to buy it
this is another way to incorporate it
I'm going to put that right underneath
to give me that really cool intense
sheen on the bottom - oh that's so
 badass dude
wanna take a little bit baby amount of
dark matter the black to add a little
bit more dimension it should look
something like this for the waterline
I'm gonna go and take the Inglot Kohl
pencil number five which is basically a
nude liner I'm gonna put that in the
waterline like this look is so grungy
and so like yeah this is not like a
normal like everyday look but it
I already crawled my lashes and I put
mascara on so I'm gonna take the new
bouncing faction lash this is a
collaboration with one my friends and
his name's Alex faction on YouTube he is
a fellow youtuber and he's like a
special-effects body painting kind of
youtuber and he did a collaboration with
new bounce um which that's no Bela minx
from New Balance um are my favorite
lashes of all time like literally ever
let's do this faction lash I've actually
never worn these the first time this is
a first time I've ever people trying on
the slash let's do this oh these are
cute these give you that nice like outer
corner extension these lashes are really
like natural like these if you are going
for more of a natural lash that's like
great giving you like nice outer corner
wing these are great this is totally
like you need to do an eyeliner or wing
with this kind of lash it's actually
really great that you don't you - I
don't like lashes that are a little bit
more full of more 3d that's just my
personal preference but these are really
nice lashes for those of you who like
that natural lash look you know and this
is what it looks like with the lashes on
I'm gonna go and zoom you guys in to see
what the final height looks like up
close and personal
perfect the eyes are done and we are
running so long okay so now I'm gonna go
in to do some blush because I have my
contour and highlight on not like
highlight but like I did in Gondor so
I'm gonna gonna take Mac blush and warm
saw an oldie but goodie on my morphe III
I'm really hoping the the leaves are
back in stock because I want you guys to
get some mmm the food so I'm just gonna
run that on the apples of my cheeks
blend it into my contour I love this
blush warm soul is one of my top blushes
of like life it is so good okay and now
for the highlight I think it's the first
time I'm using this on camera and I love
it and I'm dying and I live and breathe
for it this is the Laura Geller gilded
honey I'm gonna take that one more p.m.
501 this is one of my favorite brushes
to highlight with it really is look at
that
hmm since the eye is obviously like the
most important part of this look it's so
dramatic I want to keep the lips really
neutral I'm gonna take NYX peekaboo
neutral lip liner here and why my life
goal I'm lined and I'm gonna go ahead
and take serenity and I put that on my
lips it's honestly just a perfect like
warm brownish pink gonna put that on my
lips and I'm gonna go and let that dry
and I'm gonna go with a nude lipstick on
top just to really like tie it all
together honestly you could leave it
like this it's perfect it's such a
neutral color it's not gonna interfere
with the ìlook whatsoever but I'm gonna
go and make it a little bit lighter
because I wanted to be like almost like
a blocked out lid but not too blocked
out I'm gonna go and take YSL number one
it's like my favorite boy I saw a
lipstick and I'm gonna hit that all over
the lips it's a very light baby pink and
the reason I have serenity as my base is
gonna give me more dimension and some
keep the lipstick on a lot longer I love
the way the YSL lipstick smell they
smell like mango and it should look
something like and so this is what the
final look comes out to be I honestly
love this look I think it's so different
it's so unique it's so like weird and
kind of grungy but it's still glam at
the same time and I know it's definitely
more on the dramatic side I think it's
badass though honestly like I don't want
to just do natural natural glam all the
time you know of a natural smoky eye why
not go full-out why not go halo glitter
eye you know what I mean so I really
hope you guys enjoyed this look I got
tons of requests to do this look so I
hope you guys enjoyed how I did it yeah
other than that what else was just a
saying this is how came out it turned
out pretty good

other than that I think there's anything
else to say besides here's the night
