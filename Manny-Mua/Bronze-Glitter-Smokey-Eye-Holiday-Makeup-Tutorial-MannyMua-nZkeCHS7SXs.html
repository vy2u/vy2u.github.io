as you see from today's video today is
going to be a very glittery very bronze
Lee very holiday appropriate bronzy
smokey eye I don't know what I want to
call you have no idea but I'm thinking
more along the lines of a bronzey
glittery look the other day I did a haul
video and I hauled a reflex
glitter by Mac it was reflex bronze and
a lot of people were like you need to
film a video using the reflex bronze and
I was like okay I'm gonna film it so
that's what I'm wearing on my lids right
now as well as a nude lip this look can
be paired with any kind of lip you guys
want to do
I just think from this look with the how
eyes look I wanted to do more of a nude
subdued lip you know what I mean if you
guys wanna do a red do red if
you want to do maroon do maroon do
whatever color you want to do but this
is the look I chose for my eyes and for
my face but I think turned out really
really nice like this look will get you
a man or a woman during the
holidays okay you're at a holiday party
for your work you see someone I'm in a
distance you're like hey you what's up
with this what's up bitch you're wearing
this look done it's done it's done so
hope you guys enjoy this look I had so
much fun creating this for you guys as
always if you guys don't like this video
if you guys don't like me please don't
 watch it you know the drills 9
but you guys do like this video and you
guys do ask me please like this video
and subscribe to our channel if you want
already and yeah have a happy holidays I
love you guys so much
let's get into this tutorial okay guys
we're gonna start this face completely
bare I'm gonna do the entire face today
it's gonna be like more like a talk
through you guys know that's my style I
like to do talk through videos I like to
do the whole face most of the time I'm
gonna something really lame thing your
and I have to go somewhere so I already
primed my skin off of camera I used
benefits Porefessional I wanted a really
nice clean smooth surface for that and
professional silicone based primer
flawlessness for that okay so today I'm
gonna take a mixture of my L'Oreal Pro
matte infallible nd NARS all day
luminous I talked about this combo like
a while back we're going like kind of
old school and my old school I mean like
what like cold months I love the pro
matte available combined with NARS sheer
glow it gives me like a natural finish
but it's full coverage it's like the
weirdest thing I can't really explain it
if you guys have tried at home at mix
with the NARS infallible you know
exactly what I'm talking about the NARS
by itself I can't do like I think it's
too luminous and I don't think it lasts
all day on me you know but combined with
the pro matte it like gives me like a
mattifying effect and I love it
I'm just confident on the back of my
head and then dotting it everywhere if
you guys watched my haul video recently
I just got a bunch of the new
more feet you lead collection brushes so
I'm gonna be using the e-40 for today
just to kind of see how it is to kind of
buff out its buffing really nice though
I'm not gonna lie I like a look come
through our brush foundation the
and never take a couple drops of the
NARS foundation after new one on my neck
with that same buffing brush if you want
a nice like airbrushed finish this is
the brush for you it's densely packed
enough where it like it packs on a good
amount of foundation but it's also loose
enough where it kind of busts out
everything really really flawlessly and
airbrushed I love you guys can tell hope
yes until in the camera but it looks
super super pretty early agree so now
that the foundation is done I'm going to
go in with the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD
concealer I use this previously in a
video and I really really liked how it
turned out underneath my eye the
consistency is so so so nice it's like
sick but it's not too thick and it
doesn't crease easily on me whatsoever
so I really like that cuz most things
crease on me like crazy
I'm going to highlight and with it
you blender it out
but it's so pretty it's full-coverage
blends like a dream her fixing
that we are bright and highlighted go
ahead and set the under I'm gonna be
taking one of the new more fees it's the
e 48 which is like a nice little like
small it'd be like Tula brush I'm gonna
set my under eye with the laura mercier
secret brightening as per you guys just
dip the bitch in and now to set the face
I'm not going to take my new be 41 I'm
sorry I'm just gonna B's all the new
like elite brushes i Joyce link cuz you
know any can you brushes just like me to
use that's how I feel right now so I'm
gonna take the e 41 like a full silver I
love it I just love them big and I'm
gonna take the Urban Decay HD powder and
set the whole base with it now that our
skin is as clear as we're gonna get it
we're gonna take the more feet and five
to seven my favorite bronzing brush I
love it and hoola by benefit my go-to
bronzer it's my favorite like I'm I love
this bronzer I'm just kind of going in
on the temples in the hollows of my
cheeks down my chin a little bit and I'm
also in taking my jaw line just to kind
of accentuate the jaw a little bit more
recently I got this like um ultrasound
laser on my I like the fat of my chin
like in this area it's an ultrasound
that like kind of attacks the really
really pesky fat that you have
underneath your chin basically anywhere
they have pesky fat it kind of targets
that and for me it's underneath my chin
it's like such like I lost like 15
pounds since I've quit um drinking diet
soda and drinking so much more water and
it's please and I still cannot get rid
of the pesky under the chin fat
right here I'm just trying to conquer
the bitch away not really
working but he said the results are
gonna be coming in the next four to six
weeks and I just got it like a week go
so I'm hoping that that chin fat will be
no more no more it's gonna have AI
underneath the eyes a little bit of
taking that same a forty eight brush and
the Kat Von D shade + light using the
banana shade right here the one the hit
pan on because it's that's a good shade
that is some good shade right there
I managed to kind of highlight a little
bit underneath the eye nothing too crazy
so now that that step is done I'm gonna
go ahead and kind of cook the contour
and basically what that means is I'm
going to highlight underneath my contour
to kind of emphasize the sharp lines of
it I'm gonna take the Laura Mercier
translucent setting powder and a little
Beauty Blender go underneath the contour
basically wherever I wanted to come
sharp like so and then once you wipe
that away it's gonna be a lot more clean
and sharp and really gorgeous I'm very
contoured okay close it out we are nice
and hot I didn't contour and contoured I
mean wide contour I'm gonna go ahead and
take a blush now I got this recently and
I died for it's the two-faced little
like love flushed hearts palette like
there's a bunch of little hearts I'm
gonna that's on there's much a little
heart then they're all blushes and I
really wanted to use one of these and I
think the one I'm going to use is a
mixture of love hangover and I will
always love you and I'm gonna take that
on a morphe 53 brush just kind of dip
into it and go in so I want to go on
with oldie but a goodie we're gonna take
the makeup of a proscope ting duo in the
shade number two which is this basically
the gold shade we're gonna take that
 on the same brush because this is a
nice like flat angled brush and I really
want kind of a highlight with it too
look at that forgot how good this
 is so I'm she kind of wipe away the
cookin I'm so obsessed with his head I
forgot how much I loved it what I live
and breathe for it so we're going to
start the eyes now I already win and I
did my brows off-camera and I prime my
eyes already off of Karen because I feel
like that step is just so much so long
it's so unnecessary to show you guys
because you guys probably already know
what I do because I've shown you guys so
many times and I don't want to bore you
bitches you know I really want to use a
new pie's art palette today the one I
hauled so I'm done I'm using that today
and then I have a couple other
individual shades we're gonna use
England's I really wanted it incorporate
a very bronze Lee very glittery like how
to holiday look so that's what I'm gonna
be doing today on the eyes so first
things for someone to take beaches and
cream by makeup geek which is one of my
favorite shades from makeup geek it is
the perfect transition for me for my
skin tone if you're lighter than me or
my complexion are a little bit darker it
will definitely work for you I'm gonna
take down an e 27 I've already hit pan
on it because like twice it's so so good
and I'm just gonna go in it to the
crease what I like a lot about this
transition shade is that it's not too
warm and it's not too cool it's
literally like a very neutral peachy
shade or another really really popular
shade by makeup geek is Peach Smoothie I
love that one so much as well but this
one and just kind of like my go-to if
you guys have been watching me for a
while you guys know that beaches AHA is
like my and my titties combined
cool so we have that into the crease but
that morphe 27 there we go guys code
morpheme an emu a all caps and store
online
boom
oh that was the fastest
affiliate push I've ever done I'm in a
fight with Murphy just letting you guys
know you guys hit save 10% oh okay now
I'm gonna go in with the visor palette
I'm so excited to be using this I'm
gonna take a mixture of these two shades
right here so that's gonna go on anymore
fee and 4-3-3 basically like good mac
217 dupe and that's going to go into the
crease the visor shadows guys are so
beautiful or busy right where the
you wanna call it so I'm just gonna kind
of go in and start creating my crease
with this color all the way to the front
of the eye and then as I'm getting
closer and closer I'm doing a lot
lighter pressure I feel like with the
bronze glittery look at an orange
transition shade will be so beautiful
that blend
are you joking like that blend was
seamless damn fine are you bitch
I love you so now I'm gonna take it is a
very warm chocolate brown shade on that
same in 43 a little bit less product and
that's going to go into the crease as
well we're gonna add so much dimension
in this luck it's gonna be
dimensional okay some shouldn't take
that on the outer corner and really try
pushing that into the crease I'm taking
that all the way in to the front of the
eye as well a little bit lower than I
have at the transition shade that we
have down first and then taking it more
cm 5:07 which is a more precise pencil
brush is like very pointed in precise
I'm gonna take this gorgeous like deep
maroon shade it's not a bronzy warm
tutorial without this color a color like
maroon because I'm very maroon maroon is
like to color of my salt so I'm gonna go
in with that I wanted something a little
bit lower than the other shades that
doesn't go all the way into the front
again just like I did with the other
shades lower than my other transitions I
swear this is gonna be like the ultimate
transitional thing
and I'm just taking a clean blending
brush this is a morphe 13 and we kind of
just clean out those edges a little bit
clean up those edges nothing looks too
too too harsh and then grabbing on
estancia Beverly Hills fudge which is
actually part of their newest collection
they just did a new fall collection on a
morphe 35n small pencil brush that's
gonna go into my crease for some added
dimension and definition but it's gonna
take the darkness of the shades it's a
very dark chocolatey chocolate color put
that in the crease and if I just going
the lowest possible into our crease
right up to that very very warm
transition that we got going on and I
just didn't go halfway in I'm not gonna
take it all the way in like I did the
other shades
this one's just gonna go half way in and
it's gonna be deepest at the outer
corner cuz I think I'm gonna be doing a
winged liner with this little perfect
and now you have this fiery warm crease
going on right now I'm gonna go and
start with the lid now I grabbed my
makeup geek grin stand eyeshadow I think
it's such a beautiful bronzy shade and I
think it's gonna be perfect with this
look like absolutely perfect I'm taking
that Animorph em4 to one which is a very
nice just flat packing brush it kinda
reminds me of the Mac one and I'm just
gonna start packing up on to the lid
it's such a beautiful bronzy shade
obviously I'm gonna be putting glitter
on top so it's just gonna be my base
color right now to have underneath the
glitter to give it more dimension and
now for the fun part I'm gonna be taking
the Too Faced shadow insurance glitter
and Mac reflex bronze eye glitter and
that's gonna go on top of the lid but
I'm gonna take that same brush the m41
from morphe the Too Faced shadow
insurance glitter glue is probably my
favorite glitter glue that I've ever
ever ever ever tried I think it's so so
good if I knew you guys are looking for
a good glue glue the two-faced one is
sick and then I'm just gonna kind of
pack on some glitter glue taking some of
the glitter just dipping my I'm just
gonna dip my whole brush in it and just
pray and then just go ahead and start
packing on the lid I'm obsessed
I love mac reflex glitters because
they're so finely milled they're not an
intense chunky glitter they're basically
like a pigment with a lot of glitter in
it and that's why I love it so much I'll
be doesn't see how sickening the
reflection is it's very cool okay cool
so let's go ahead and finish the other
alpha camera wick I'll be right back
so this is what the eyes look like so
far also random like just like a random
side note you guys do not need the vise
art palette to do this I know that the
palette is hella expensive but you don't
need to use this palette to be able to
accomplish this look you can use like
the morphe 35o it's very warm just like
this you can use some makeup geek
shadows you can use whatever you guys
have at your disposal so just don't
don't think you need to use the vise our
palette to be able to accomplish this
look I just got this and I wanted to use
it because I love people haven't asked
me to use it so this is what I came up
with so far I hope you guys like the
eyes okay great so I went and I did my
liner off-camera I just need both hands
and I need the mirror to be this close
to do it you guys know what I mean like
when you're doing your eyeliner and
you're like you need to be like holding
your breath this close that's
what I do
so yeah I did off camera so now that my
eyes are beat to death I can feel the
pain pulsing through my body I'm gonna
go and do the bottom lash line now so
we're gonna grab the Urban Decay
perversion liner I was debating I was
like I want to do a smoky bottom
lash line I don't want to do like a more
like natural lash line but I think
because we're going so like festive and
so holiday and you want to catch the
bitch's eyes from the end of the
room we're gonna go with smoky on the
bottom when I shine because we smokey
says we ain't playing around and we
messing with no bitches sup perversion
urban decay line the lower waterline it
doesn't have to be like meat or
anything like that you're just need to
line it taking the same ether t6 pencil
brush we're gonna start just diving into
the colors that we use from the Weiser
palette all the four up here we're just
gonna start diving in using those colors
we're going to just kind of blend out
this lower lash line
I'm gonna first go in with a really
chocolatey shade right here you should
like blend out the liner first morphe
and 508 blend out of that perversion
liner a little bit we're to start
blending out the lower lash line
basically what we did on the top we're
going to at the bottom as well so taking
that shading or something to kind of
blend over the black with that a36
pencil brush and then now taking a 18 by
morpheus while transitioning out like we
did at the top we're doing at the bottom
making it very warm okay so I went ahead
and I
yeah did a lot of camera I think so I
went ahead and I put on my lashes off of
camera because it was just gonna be a
little bit easier that way I am using
the new bounce um Bella lashes you guys
know Bella lashes from new bounce some
are my favourite lashes they're so
fluttering and so dramatic and so like
extra but I think they're super super
super badass and I love new bouncing as
a brand they offer their affiliates
which I am 20% off for their followers
my codes man um you guys interested you
guys go save 20% off the entire site so
I think that's super super cool and I
think it's really great that they offer
