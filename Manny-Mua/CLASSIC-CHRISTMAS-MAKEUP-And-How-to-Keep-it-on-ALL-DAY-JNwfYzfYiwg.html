corner as well as in fun if you guys can
see on the end of the wing a little bit
of glitter they're going on it's kind of
cute it's fun it's festive and it's very
classic but it still has like a fun
little twist on it with the glitter and
I think it turned out really really well

am a disaster and a half I always always
always get sick during the holidays it's
just like one of those things I just do
naturally it's like my immune system
doesn't is not having it with me I did
so much right now I just took a
dayquil I did as I cam in my nose and
then I just did zzzquil and airborne
right now I started filming this so I'm
hoping that my cold will go away
so we're going to doing this really cool
just easy not like wait don't get
twisted and say like wait I said easy
the Loreal Pro matte infallible on a
Beauty Blender pouncing it into the seed
zone of my skin and I'm going to be
putting that only on the t-zone and I'm
gonna be using different foundations for
the rest of the face whatever foundation
routine works great for you fantastic
but this is gonna be so it can last me
all throughout the entire Christmas Day
or Christmas Eve whatever you guys
celebrate even if you don't celebrate it
any kind of holiday you guys do
something break around the Christmas
time
this is gonna be a great option for you
because you want to keep the makeup on
and pop in as long as you can as long as
we can make it ever HD 120 swipes
not on the neck like a garden air flash
300 I guess we're using 300 or 200 win
whoo Beautyblender that whore out what's
today's Wednesday I'm filming it child I
have an interview right now coming up
I'm like stressing not like stressing
dressing but it's just like it'll be
like a cool thing if I do get it so I'm
about to do the right now my neck right
here on the sides are so swollen look
from being sick like the lymph nodes
mm-hmm you guys see the swelling you see
that yeah lymph node calm the down
buddy we're gonna contour you away later
so I'll off so actually after my
interview I have a show to go to drawing
my friend Gabby from the gabbie show if
you guys I don't know if you know that
is but he's a really really really
hilarious youtuber like she cracks me
the up I love her so much and her
and Ricky Dillon and a couple other
people are doing a blip sync show I
don't really know what they're doing but
they're doing something really fun in
them I got invited so I want to go to
him say hi because I want to support my
friend you know Torchic - and so that's
all we're gonna be doing today
oh so I guess we're going in with the
shade that's 4 times lighter didn't
realize reading that cool love it Tim
Gunn says make it work make it
work man cuz I feel like doing the
holidays you want a really bright under
eyes lot no one knows that we've been
you know hooking up with there man
you know like like better like you know
like when you hook up with somebody
else's bottle you don't want to
 people to know that you were
staying up all night and pounding and
downs you know he's like the fastest
clam I'm doing right now you guys don't
even understand like I have an hour to
do this entire thing because I interview
starts at 4:00 and it's two and I'm
baking underneath the eyes because you
wanted to last so are Mercier
translucent all over the rest of the
face because I'm not getting leaving
today I'm this make us to last me like a
good 10 hours so and nice last you guys
10 hours - if you guys are going out
there like New Year's or no one ears
like Christmas Eve like you when you put
that on during the day like you
need that to last all day
huh pressing the laura mercier
translucent all into my skin because I
cannot find a puff not find a puff but
again pressing in translucent power is
gonna really help ensure the makeup
stays on all day long
even if you're dry how definite suggest
using a maybe like a hydrating powder
like the RCM a1 is any really great to
ensure that the makeup lasts all day
long are all night on whatever you want
it to be and try to make sure you press
it in don't wipe because you will move
it the foundation underneath so you want
to keep it as not a sitting room it's
only gonna take some powder NC 25 by Mac
my portrait is so my shirt says
come to Daddy
bidding number taking the NC 25 powder
down my net on this morphe y7 I've been
really loving this brush like a lot
there's a lot of texture on my skin
right now book I just break out when I
get sick you know insta mark underneath
the eyes you guys know I love the insta
mark powder it is so beautiful it's so
brightening but still very very
lightweight and it doesn't look heavy on
the skin I just really like how this
makes my under eyes look so let's go and
take some butter bronzer by Physicians
Formula on my little morphe wife at all
over the perimeters of my gotta it gives
me enough color but doesn't give me like
too much where I'm like overwhelmed
while I'm lying bitch you are to bronzy
like you went too hard in the bed you
know but give me just enough it's a very
nice neutral color and it smells great
that's great house I look ok now
we're going contour a slight some mijin
of a smidge take my Kevyn Aucoin
medium sculpting powder on this morphe
y9 put that into the pocket mmm
so easy with this brush it don't
sleep on this brush why 9 go ahead and
contour your lymph nodes if you like cut
the cheek like you cut the hater
I don't know why I'm so chilly that
today a guy like apologize I don't know
what is coming over me baby Stevie's
trying to make a way out of me
and I told her no I told her no okay
that's gonna add some blush okay blush
now when I'm taking a more fee for and
Rebecca flower child blush I might put
that on the really pretty points on my
face I mean okay on the apples of the
cheeks so I'm gonna where the
pretty point of the face came from that
was
that's beyond me on that one sorry it's
funny how like when I'm filming or when
I'm doing something like productive
everyone decides to text me like right
now I'm like what about when I was doing
literally nothing wipe away the cookin
good lookin so now we take the morphe
why 14 and honest osseous starlight
illuminator Havanese when these bad boys
and firm ever it was like back on the
old house and I'm like let me grab it
but uh I knew I loved it
mmm I'm in kuntum oh great
the face is basically done snatch to the
 gods I'm gonna go ahead and fill
in my brows off of camera and I'll be
right back okay amazing so I went in and
I just finished my brows off the camera
and I contour my nose a little bit just
to make it look slightly more snatched
than in real life okay so also went
ahead and primed my eyes off of camera
this is what I use I use the Smashbox
24-hour photo finish shadow primer it's
the best prime ever found it works
fantastically kiss makeup on all day it
just it just works it works very very
very well you want to keep on your
Christmas makeup or whatever holiday
makeup you want to do use a good shadow
base to do it that's all I'm saying that
is my advice to you from me to you for
free okay so for today's video we're
going to be using the morphe 35o palette
which I believe is the fall palette I
just think this palette is really truly
absolutely amazing and I just really
wanted to use this for today's video and
I think that for fall like this is just
this is just fantastic man and so
because we're doing like this really
easy simple type of look where I can do
anything too extravagant in today's
makeup tutorial so I rather just do
something really quick easy with the
palette that's all in like 20 bucks you
can't go wrong with this palette so I'm
gonna dip first into this shade right
here which is a really pretty like
transition very peach smoothie each type
of shade we're gonna go ahead and put
that into the crease can you go seeping
into right here the crease putting it
very very very lightly on a more 5027
I'm just gonna blend that into the eye
very very easily and nothing too crazy
or heavy very lightweight pressing it in
this shadow is very very very light it's
just going to be our transition shade so
I'm putting it all over the crease and
even up to the brow bone to set that
concealer I head down first anyway so as
you can see it's almost looking like
there's nothing there it's kind of what
we're going for now I'm gonna go in way
is this shader here mixed with these two
these two shades right here when I mix
them together and I put that on a
morpheme 4 3 3 and that's going to go
into the crease to help deepen up the
crease and make it a little bit more
just deep you know just um just for some
more depth uh pigmented should look
something like these and I just defined
outer corner crease thing and I'm gonna
go in with this really pretty chocolatey
Brown right there and I put that on the
most outer corner part of our eye and
very lightly press that in to make sure
that we get a nice warm depth into the
look all right layer pressing it into
that same brush it's a really pretty
rustic Brown like very red and brown
with that about halfway into the crease
just putting it lower and not as far in
if you guys feel me I was gonna blend
between steps with that e27 make sure
there's no harsh lines the warm Browns
during Christmas are you kidding that's
my bread and butter I don't know
why I like seeing bread and butter so
much I just do shut up shut up and see
anything so now for the lid I'm actually
gonna take that same highlighting
under-eye powder that we took I'm gonna
put that onto the lid of my eye I think
during the holidays like a really pretty
matte eye with accentuating kind of
glitter and stuff like that
works very very very well and is really
pretty so I'm gonna pass that on to my
eye to give me just a nice bright awake
look this is on a more free em 210 feel
like it adds a nice like really pretty
bright effect at the end of the day it's
like contouring your eye you know it
means that's what we're gonna do we're
gonna Pat on to the eye and what this
look it doesn't matter if you do not
have this insta mark powder that's
totally fine just use any matte cream
chain that you have and it's gonna work
totally totally great with this you do
not need to use this exact color I just
have it here with me and I use it today
so that's why I'm using it I'll go ahead
just blend out the edges of the matte
shadows so there's no harsh lines so I'm
gonna go ahead and highlight the brow
bone I'm gonna take this really pale
frosty yellow shade right here this
these shades are very very frosty and
very intense like like to go and
highlight the brow bone with the color
it's really really really intense very
frosty
single definitely a lightweight with the
that glistens like a second diamond
in this guy we're gonna take an e 43
brush I'm gonna take this really pretty
chocolatey Brown right here and I'll run
that on the lower lash line just very
close to the lashes and mainly on the
outer corner I'm not bringing it too far
in just keeping it on the outer lash
line I'm just go ahead and blend that
bad boy out whatever little pencil brush
that you have we're just going to add a
little bit of definition on the outer
corner and now onto a very important
part of doing a Christmas holiday makeup
domine we're gonna take the Kat Von D
trooper eyeliner or gonna create a wing
and I feel like with this kind of look
you want to go more bold I'm gonna do
more of a bold issuing maybe we'll see
how it works and just go and fill that
bad boy in but okay great so the lashes
are on Bella new bounce um you guys are
too new
you guys do not need to do a dramatic
pair though because this look is not
going to be as dramatic as other like
holiday looks are so nothing's are just
doing any lash you guys want or you
don't have more lashes at all really
doesn't matter
I just wanted to wear lashes because I
feel it's gonna accentuate this look a
lot better and I'm going to a interview
up to this so I need to be full
clamp at all times okay so basically
what imma do now is I'm gonna take a
little bit of the Too Faced glitter glue
and already putting a little bit right
here on the inner corner my eye and on
the outer part of my wing and I'm gonna
be adding Mac reflex pearl glitter to it
just to make it look fun and festive in
just like extra you know what I mean
I'll take this on a little more feet r45
gonna load up this brush right at the
beginning of my eye right here and on
the end of my wing up here everything
can be kind of a fun different thing I'm
gonna go and just dunk my brush into the
reflex pearl and pack on the area I just
put the glitter glue like that and oh
here I think it's just cute it's just
different go ahead and add a nude liner
to the waterline if you would like I'm
gonna take the Tarte nude liner run that
in my waterline wake up everything a
little bit more
okay amazing so now that the eyes are
done this is what they look like very
festive fun just flirty and I just think
it's a cute look not for the lip I feel
like I have to go with red
I'm gonna do a red lip just because it's
Christmas have a red background I'm like
I just feel like that's a great color so
I'm going to go ahead and take the shade
from Urban Decay this is the lip pencil
in bad blood I'm gonna lip line my
entire lips with this so we're actually
gonna go and fill in the entire lip
because I mean during the holiday season
you guys need a lot I mean I don't know
if you guys need a lot but I eat a lot
and so I need to fill in my entire lip
with the lip liner to ensure longevity
okay entire lip is completely filled in
red and I'm gonna go in with the
Anastasia American doll liquid lipstick
it's a beautiful blue toned red very
holiday you know red is so scary to
up because you're just if you
 up if you want to add a beauty mark
go right ahead I'm just gonna go over
the one I already have naturally
that's okay and yeah guys that's
