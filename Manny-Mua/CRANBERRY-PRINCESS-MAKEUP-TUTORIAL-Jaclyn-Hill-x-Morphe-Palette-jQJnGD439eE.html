so today's video is going to be a highly
requested video actually so I posted a
photo recently this dude right here and
I had so much positive feedback I had so
many people asking me to create a
tutorial to teach you guys how to do
this look especially because I was using
jacqueline hill and morphe palette so I
decided to ask you guys on Twitter and
snapchat if you guys really did want to
see it and I got so much positive
feedback like dude film this fucking
look or you will get castrated and I was
like I'd rather keep my balls you know
so Apple takes me I was going to be I'm
going to be doing a whole cranberry
princess smokey eye I thought would be
really really fun the look is not too
hard to do actually don't really
remember the steps I just have my photo
and I'm just gonna reference it because
I don't when you're doing makeup and
you're not doing it tutorial you just
kind of going in and you're playing
you're just kind of playing around
you're just doing your own things so
that's kind of what I did and I had no
idea I was going to be filming it so now
that I'm feeling it I'm like okay let's
really let's really try to recreate this
bad bitch so wish me luck I don't have
any highlighter on right now because I'm
going to film a highlighter review after
this video so this is video number one
out of three let's get this bitch
started I want a standard I always do
that I don't know why I always do that
as always if you guys don't like this
video if you guys do not like me please
don't fucking watch it you know the
drill with thang but you guys do like
this video please subscribe to my
channel if you're not already and if
you're new what's up and mani MUA and
welcome to my channel thank you so much
for being here I really appreciate it
guys it's going into this cranberry
princess smokey eye tutorial
so before I get started the palette is
coming back on Tuesday the 18th of July
at 8 a.m. Pacific Standard Time aka 11
a.m. Eastern Standard Time and if you
guys don't know exactly what time that
is in your time zone go ahead and google
it I'm not really sure on the other time
zones actually and I'm not so excited
for it to come back because I have used
and abused my Jacquelyn palette I think
it's so absolutely amazing and I'm so
proud of them for creating such a great
palette and of course you guys can use
my code Mandy MUA and all caps in store
online if you guys want to buy the
palette or by any kind of morphe
products
I highly recommend them I think they're
fantastic as you guys I'm sure know if
you follow me you know what was a bucket
bitch from work okay let's start this
bad bitch out actually don't know
exactly where I put the little paper
that comes with it saying the shade
names so I'm just going to be dunking in
with shadows and I'm going to leave
exactly what shadows I'm going to be
dunking in on the screen with like a
little moon like I usually do with eye
tutorials so you guys will know the
reference I want to take a more feet 27
and I'm gonna blend this really pretty a
transition shade in it to the crease but
we're just gonna go willy-nilly I don't
know exactly what I did for that
tutorial I just know what the color I
use for the lid the crease everything
else I have no idea I just played I'm
gonna mix a little bit of this red end
shade in with this like really pretty
brown I want to put that into the crease
on a morphe r39 amazing do for them back
to 17 that's gonna go in the outer
corner and we're gonna press it on and
that's gonna go all the way in right up
into the inner corner of our crease when
looking for the crease I just tilt my
head up guys and I just literally feel
where the brush fit into the socket of
your high that is usually the crease
okay okay and once you deposited the
actual color take that you 27 again and
blend out that transition I'm gonna take
a little bit this other really warm
brown as well and just add on some more
colors and more depth a corner blend it
into the crease a bit so I just decided
that I'm gonna do one eye on camera and
just finish the whole entire eye here
and now I'll just do the other one off
of camera so I'm not wasting our time to
just like keep going back and forth
hopefully I remember the steps morphe
r41 i want to take this really pretty
chocolatey dark brown that's gonna go on
the outer
just packed on out here
and into the crease as well and that
didn't go so much lower than the other
shades I'm just going to deepen the
outer corner and this is what's gonna
make a little bit more smokey eye can
see boom dark smoky and sexy I was gonna
blend out that color and mesh it in with
the other shades that we have with that
same r39 I see this all time guys with
makeup has no rules if you feel like oh
my god I'm stressed like you're not
gonna get it right dude just play just
practice practice makes perfect when it
comes to makeup and try not to take it
too seriously at the end of the day it's
makeup it washes off and it's fun and
it's creative and it's your expression
so try not to worry about it too much if
you feel like you're not getting the
steps exactly right don't worry about it
too much because you will eventually I
promise so now for the star of the show
I'm gonna be taking this beautiful
intense cranberry shade it's so stunning
it's like oh damn I'm gonna spray a
little bit of fix+ on it Oh y'all see
that shit I know y'all dude I wanna take
that all the way in to the inner corner
there's gonna press it on and this is on
a morphe M 210 it's just a really good
packing brush great for eyeshadow
specifically taking a little more of
that maroon shade on that 139 I'm gonna
blend that into the crease to marry that
really shimmery intense shade to make it
not look so cut crease like so I'm not
really trying to cut the crease I'm just
really trying to blend it out and make
it look like a cranberry smokey eye as
you guys can see it just looks more like
it's blending out diffusing into the
other shades not just like so harsh like
mmm so I'm gonna take the first shade in
the palette it's like a very intense
shimmering bright
the nylon e-type shade and I'll take
that on a morphe m3 2:6 Graper packing
on the inner corner and on the brow bone
specifically because it is so small
precise I'm gonna take that on the brow
bone
Oh as such Wow okay I forgot
I wonder y'all want him to fucking do
twirl good that she looks looking mom
I'm sorry just blending a little bit
that you 27 just a light little flurry
nothing intense just a little okay guys
so this is what we should have on the
top of the ice so far I'm gonna do the
top of the eye on the other side and I
will be right back okay we completed at
both sides Psalm 110 symmetrical but
it's okay because life isn't symmetrical
I think when I did the look either took
a black eyeliner or a dark brown
eyeliner is what I'm gonna do today
thumbs like the monster brown eyeliner
by ardency in one of my favorite gel
liners ever at the shade dark brown I'm
gonna run that in my lower lash line
very very liberally so I'm gonna take it
more fat you 36 blend that out
okay cool now that we're looking cool
we're going to take that same morphe r41
and we're going to dunk in that same
really warm chocolatey Brown that we
used on the crease on the outer corner
or I going to smoke out and set the
brown eyeliner and guys this is a smoky
eye you guys can make it real fucking
smoky if you want to if you don't that's
cool too and just start transitioning
out that color as well now when doing an
intense a smoky eye like this I always
suggest doing winged liner I think
winged liner complements smoky eyes so
much so I'm gonna go do some winged
eyeliner off of camera and apply some
lashes and I'll be right back with the
final level okay guys so we are
basically done with the entire look this
is what it looks like I'm wearing Lily
lashes in the style of Mykonos last my a
little video I said shade yeah some
people some people clock me for that for
sure I'm almost done with the tutorial
about what I did to give it a little
more pop of something something I added
the Urban Decay Midnight Cowboy glitter
on the inner part of my eye right here
right in the inner corner and that is it
you guys that's it for today's entire
video I'm gonna go off and from another
video right now let me know if you guys
want to see any other looks using the
chocolate palette or any other palette
