so today's video is going to be a
favourites and disappointments video I
have not done one of these and they
 Minaj I'm in minute not
threesome
I love favorites and disappoint his
videos I love watching them I also don't
see a lot of other Beauty youtubers
doing favorites and disappointments
anymore and it just makes me sad because
like I love watching them I don't know
maybe they're just not as popular
anymore maybe they just don't get the
music they used to and random sight know
a lot of people like to go and rag on
YouTube for talking about views but
honestly when it is your full-time jobs
views is kind of important you know it
really really is like that is like part
of your income I know a lot of people
will try to like send me like oh it
shouldn't matter how many of you guys
just took mission mad about the content
and of course it's just the content
should matter but views for a full-time
beauty youtuber or an a youtuber in
general views do matter to keep up with
your life you know what I mean like that
is your full-time job just saying so I
do understand if people don't want to do
this video these kind of videos anymore
because they aren't as popular as they
once were I'm trying to do them at least
a couple times every so often you
automate I really wanted to do one for
this month of November November was
amazing if flu bi were already in
December right now I love the holiday
season I love a holiday time I love when
like holiday stuff comes out there's so
much makeup that's out during the
holidays I'm rambling let me stop a
favorites video and display this video
that's what tasty I was going to be as
always if you guys don't like this video
if you guys don't like me please don't
 watch I cannot drill with that
what do you guys do like this video
please go ahead and subscribe to my
channel if you're not already and if
you're new what's up a man um you a and
welcome to my channel thank you so much
for being here I really really really
really appreciate it yeah it's going to
get into this favorites and
disappointment video of
look you guys first things first first
favorite of this month is this
I got tatted you guys I got tatted again
this is my tie right here this was done
by Evan tattoo in New York I was there
recently and I got this tattoo and it
just is so cool Navy
I love Evan he's absolutely amazing he
is such an amazing tattoo artist and I
love his dainty detailed work on the tat
I just want to talk about real quickly
because that is my number one favorite
of the entire month I love it I feel
like I have a tattoo bug this one is
covered up right now because I had to
get it retouched and because it was like
coming off on the finger apparently like
it's like hard to keep a tattoo on the
finger but this bitch hurt like a
 the second time getting a
tree tattoo hurts so much more than
getting a tattoo I don't know why she
was making me like I was twitching for
moments of this one okay guys anyway so
it's going it started outside video
first one I wanted to talk about this
really quickly cuz this I have been
going through like crazy over the past
couple months this is from freshness of
these fresh sugar lip caramel hydrating
balm I'm gonna show you the obsession is
 real so fresh is actually really
expensive it's a it's Brandon sin
Sephora to skincare brand and they're
like lip balms are so good I love them
so much
but they're usually pretty expensive
they're like 25 bucks I think actually
don't really know exactly how much they
cost but this guy is like 20 bucks and
it lasts such a good amount of time and
it's so great it's such a hydrating balm
and it literally tastes and smells like
caramel if you're like a fan of caramel
you will love this you will love it
because it is that so soothing so
hydrating it just feels so good on the
lips I just want to bring it up because
I have been going through this like a
madman look at that look at that I
love it so so so much so you guys are
looking for a really good high-end lip
balm that's not gonna break the bank
this was twenty bucks I mean that's a
lot but something that's good good
quality I would definitely check out the
fresh lip caramel it's on rau
it's on Ram
next we're gonna talk about is this this
is the Bobbi Brown vitamin enriched face
base actually purchases because of a
Jeffrey he was a huge huge fan of this
and I bought it back in the day and I
had never really tried it and then I
started getting on Bobby Brown's PR list
and they sent me another one and I was
like ok I'm gonna try it out Jeffrey
loved it and I never really like give it
a chance
I've been using this for the past month
non-stop and honestly I've noticed a
major difference in the way my makeup
looks throughout the day so this is
great because it
as if it's a moisturizer but it also
acts as a primer as well it really just
makes my skin look so much prettier with
it on like literally like my fine lines
out of you guys and see like I usually
have fine lines gnarly like right here
right I'm wearing this today
sigh no but my fine lines don't peek
through as much of weighing this I don't
know why I think it's is just so
hydrated and the skin foundation lays
better everything about it makes my skin
look so much better this is a pricier
price point it really is don't
get me wrong
our deadlines are just going to support
and getting it maybe a little sample and
a little sample cup instead of buying it
right away
but truly I've noticed a huge difference
with this it's great for all skin types
I'll check out the Bobbi Brown enriched
skin base because me in the ass if
you guys know where that shows from if
you know where that's from we are
 soul mate Nexus go and talk
about an eyeshadow really quickly that I
have been wearing now i
some and actually this came out really
recently like within this actual month
of November and I've worn it a couple
times this is the Stila these are new
these are new the new shimmer and glow
shadows so you guys already know I'm a
huge fan of the glittering glow shadows
they're amazing I'm obsessed but
not everyone wants glitter all the time
you know I'm saying they just came out
with these shimmer and glow shadows that
act the exact same way I was scared that
they were gonna like dry differently or
they were gonna crack on me or anything
like I was just kind of nervous I was
like please don't with the
formula like please steal you kill it
but these are spectacular key honestly
look at this bitch I'm sorry you guys
these shadows are stunning I'm sorry
they're literally like some of the most
beautiful shadows I was so
shocked I'm like oh you guys came up
with the glitter and you come out with
the shimmers y'all really trying to
 destroy the game huh also I
talked about this in my holiday haul
force' for this is something I said that
I would suggest this Stila set comes
with glitter and glow shadows and
shimmering glow shadows so if you guys
wanted to get a cute little deal this
guy I believe was like 30 something
dollars for six so I thought that was
really really good deal I'm very happy
this is in the shade kitten I've been
wearing a lot I talk about a palette
that I've been loving all month long I
mean it's not like I've used it like
three or four times but that's a lot for
me in like the makeup world that's a lot
for me that's a lot for me though what
I'm getting like a new makeup in the
mail and also buying a new makeup like
when I'm using something constantly
consistently all the time like three or
four times in a month that's what I know
I'm like oh
I liked you I liked you so the palette
i'm talking about is this palette by
kylie jenner this is the nice palette
it's gotten a little beat up not gonna
lie it's got a little hit it's just so
good this color scheme guys look at her
it's just beautiful I don't I really
don't know what to say other than the
fact that I love these colors I love the
way that these shadows blend I love the
way they look on the eye everything
about it truly I'm so pleased with it
and apparently a lot of people did like
a review on the kylie jenner holiday kit
right and the whole holiday set and a
lot of people reviewed this palette
didn't I shot a look with it and used
Blizzard on the lid I had no
clue how people were like commenting
like why'd you have to use blizzard
everyone use blizzard I'm like bitch and
I didn't know I just like that
color and so I used it me and Laura
apparently did the same look had no idea
I'm really happy with it and it's $44 it
is of course a higher price point but
it's great quality and I do think that
Kylie cosmetics really killed
you with this one let's talk about what
my highlighter really quickly that these
are actually brand new these are from
colour-pop these are the luster dust as
you guys know I feel like a lot of
brands are coming up with these kind of
shimmery dusts like highlighters under
shimmery I feel like artist Couture was
one of the first brands that I really
had them going like they made them a
little bit more popular I just want to
talk about this really quickly because
they aren't incredible they are
incredible
this isn't shade know me it's in the
shade know me so this is it right here
I'm wearing it on my cheeks right now
cheeks they're on my cheeks and it's
just such a beautiful finely
milled dust have you liked it that Kylie
Jenner one that like that those little
dust in the jar this is literally
exactly the literally exactly
the same but a fraction of the cost
like no shade - Kylie head off because I
just talked to me I just talked about a
product I love it I think they're
 amazing I think that they did an
amazing job I use like a really packy
brush to put them on and then PI so good
I literally feel like I'm beaming from
 space on my yo-you the astronaut
over there eh I don't know I just think
that they're credible I really do I
really do
you guys and the last product of the
month in the favorite section is this
guy right here this is honesty I talked
about it really quickly because it's so
 so I think and I'm so proud of
Laura for doing this so Laura Lee and
Claire pop Cosmetics created a
collaboration together and all the
proceeds
from this collaboration go to no kill la
a which is an animal shelter here in Los
Angeles Laura gets no proceeds ramp
does not get any proceeds as well they
literally are donating full proceeds to
no killer lady do it every single year
and I'd want to talk about it really
quickly because I just think it's such
an amazing amazing thing she came out
with three little products with color
pop and she came out with a eyeshadow
quad with clip off as well for me
personally my favorites is the gloss the
ultra glossy lip in the shade Wham I'm
just gonna swatch a little bit on it
because it's literally like the
prettiest glossiest wet looking gloss
it's right here it's just like a wet
gloss like it's a wet shimmery clear
gloss with beautiful like finely milled
to glitter in it it's stunning oh my
gosh the quad is so perfect it's so
beautiful
like Laura really did that Laura
Lee Laura did that Lee bitch okay I'm
gonna go ahead and swatch the quad on my
hand right I'm gonna swatch the quality
we worse watching right now glicks we
have a glitz on the hand so we're gonna
switch swatch Ritz which is a glitter
right there a clear glitter with next
hiney Laura is like hilarious with me
the up and we have hiney right here
and it's really pretty rose gold last
but not least we have shiny which is a
more like a set it's like a satiny brown
satin brown shade right there these are
the four shades that it comes with the
quad it's a beautiful quad it's goes to
an amazing I'm using comes the quality
is incredible and before people come at
me and me like Laura's your best friend
you're only talking about it because
she's your best friend
no I'm talking about it because it's an
amazing cause Laura doesn't even get any
proceeds from it and I'm gonna just mean
that much to her and it's just amazing
to me I really makes me really really
happy to see people doing good things
you know I mean good things with their
platforms so a color pop and Laura you
guys killed it with that club and I
think you guys are amazing
okay first things first first
disappointment of the month is this guys
I don't you guys saw my video I posted a
little while back this is the Pat
McGrath palette these is the mothership
palette the mattes of this palette were
incredible they really were but honestly
my issue was that it was a hundred and
twenty five dollars for ten my shadows
and that was such a problem for me I
couldn't even believe that I bought this
 ballot like I was shocked and
some of the shades here they're really
flaky I had a lot of Fallout on my face
I was like
how the am I gonna use like how do
I use this and get my money's worth
because it was not cooperating at all
how so think there's no transition sheet
in here whatsoever it's like shimmers
over here and then to Matt's and then
you have this metallic and doing chrome
chains over there I did understand the
pallets I didn't get them at all I was a
little pissed not going so that is my
first disappointment of the month and my
second is women of the month not just
this it's the whole collection
Maybelline and Gigi Hadid collaborated
and they came out with this entire
amazing collection that had like so many
SKUs and it was a crazy amount of
product and the reason it's in my
disappointment is another price point
thing their palette that came out was
like $35 and it's Maybelline and I think
the reason that I pissed me off because
the thing is the quality of all the
products were great the quality was
actually really really really nice I was
watching them and I was like oh my word
like most of the things were
incredible but I couldn't believe that
they hiked up the price point so much
more because I had G's name on it I all
know it was like I don't know it just
didn't make any sense a $35 palette from
the drugstore I didn't understand it and
I don't think hitting the items should
have been priced out what they were I
think like the some ellipses for like 12
or 13 bucks when they're usually six or
seven or eight a lot of people I'm sure
did not buy it because of the fact that
it was a lot it was a lot more expensive
than the usual Maybelline products was I
was disappointed in the fact that was
priced so high and I love Liebling I
worked at Maybelline before and I think
they have beautiful beautiful drugstore
products but at the end of the day they
are drugstore brand and I wish that the
price point stayed more at a drugstore
more affordable price point and that is
that you guys that's it for my entire
favourites and disappointments video of
this month I hope you guys had fun
watching I really do love doing these
videos and if you guys if you guys don't
like them just let me know like I do not
have to make these videos what's
whatever I get it a lot of people
stopped making them and I really know
why maybe they just lost passion for it
I don't know but I really do love them I
think there's so much fun and I love to
get to express myself with you guys
didn't get to express products that I
have been loving I don't know I really
like them if you guys don't want to see
them if you guys don't like them I will
not do them anymore
just let me know and the cost will be
low because it's like I of course create
content that I love but I want to create
content I know you guys will love and
will watch as well so that's like an
important part of being a youtuber as
being able to gauge what your audience
would actually like to see or just let
me know in the comments so I can
continue to do them if you would like
because if not they will stop I might
still do many many yeah you guys
of course I'll leave everything that I
talked about in today's video linked
down below as I always do check out my
Instagram Twitter snapchat all that
will be linked it down below as
well I love you guys so much thank you

videos you guys are incredible how gates

video bye guys I love you I love you

moment I'm having right now my little
black rhinestone my little black
lipstick mother McMahon then so I think

hydrating great for dry skin or
combination skin great for a freaking
normal skin great for my skin
it feels fun eating great they just came
out with these shimmer and glow shadows
that act the exact same way honor the
eye as the glitter ones do like I was
scared that I was gonna this is exactly
