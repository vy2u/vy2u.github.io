it takes video is going to be a
favorites video I have not filmed one of
these in so long actually two
favorites and disappointments video I
have a couple of disappointments I've
accumulated in the past couple months I
really sat down and filmed a favourites
and his appointments video in a minute
and I think it's because I've been
traveling so much recently I don't
really ever gonna test out too many new
different products when I am traveling
and I kind of forget to film these
videos so it's been about like two or
three months since I fell my last one
and I just love filming these so much I
love sitting down and just chatting with
you guys talking about my here products
recently and talking about your guys's
have your products recently and that is
literally all I'm gonna be doing today
I'm just sitting down this is the third
video I'm filming today so excuse me if
my energy is not at this right now I'm
currently ranked right here but anyways
you guys that's what today's video is
going to be as always if you guys do not
like this video if you guys do not like
me
please stop watching you know
Joe with that but if you guys do like
this video please subscribe to my
channel if you're not already and if
you're new what's up at Manny MUA and
welcome to my channel I'll go and get
into this favourites and disappointments
of at the moment okay let's go and get
started on today's video let's go and
start with the favorites of the moment
not the disappointments render the
displacements so first things first
gonna start off with this fragrance this
is like kind of embarrassing but I don't
really give that much of a this is
the Shawna Mendez fragrance for men and
women I bought this and the reason I
bought it is because well one I want to
 you guys this scent is just so nice
oh it reminds me of Nikita like every I
swear to God every fragrance
amazing Nikita it's almost like it's a
very sweet scent it's not like really
musky and intense it's definitely much
more of a perfume and than it is a
cologne but this is what Sean smells
like uh I don't know anything about
clones and perfumes it's not my world at
all but I love it and that is one
favorite of the month the next favorite
of the month you guys I've literally
been wearing this the past week straight
I haven't had it too long but I already
know it's a favorite of mine this is the
Fenty Beauty foundation of my Rihanna
you I'm wearing the foundation on my
skin right
now honest you guys this foundation is
just so stunning I want to
scream it gives you such a beautiful
amount of cover it's not full coverage
it's not sheer coverage it's like a nice
medium buildable coverage finish is like
a soft matte it sets itself you do it on
you set it with a powder I personally do
because I need all the help I can get
I'm a holy mess it really does
look like a soft filter over your face
I don't even honestly I have no
problem with this foundation and I think
it's like 34 bucks that is such a good
price for a high-end foundation I've
seen other foundations I go for like 65
bucks so I think that they absolutely
killed it I don't know how it's going to
look on someone with drier skin I really
have no idea might be slightly patch
here I don't know I would highly
recommend it if you are oily or if
you're more combination River normal and
has 40 shades 40 shades
oh they did that with that launch guys
they did that I wear the shade
210 that's inclusive as I think
that's really amazing one more thing
from FNT beauty I wanted to shout out is
their highlighters these are the
kilowatt highlighters I think that's a
cool name kilowatt so I wanted to talk
about this color specifically this is in
the shade hustle baby and mean money I'm
not really a fan of this shade this one
some I think this is much more of a
natural like natural I don't know I
don't know but this one bitch so on the
right side my right we have the we have
this one right here which is the
brightest why don't we have like
the more subtle one I just thing that
they did a really great job with these
highlighters as well I think they're
 stunning I'm not really a huge
fan of the one that says moon in the
title of it which is funny because I'm a
 banana
I think that this one is beautiful I
think that their trophy wife one is so
beautiful it doesn't really work too
well on my complexion because I am a
really really really fair so just be
cautious with that when it comes to the
shade trophy wife but it is a beautiful
shade Oh
what I have to say the ultimate
highlighter that I've been loving for
the past couple months this is the shade
Uranus this is me and Jeffries
collaboration so one of the guys it's a
very pretty pale gold so I'm gonna
swatch Eleuthera here
if i swatched uranus uranus is right
here i'm actually wearing it on my
cheeks today I'm only wearing Uranus on
the cheeks this highlighter guys I've
been wearing it non-stop you don't
understand
I literally wear it every single time I
do a makeup it's such a beautiful pale
gold if you are fair in complexion and
if you're really really light and you
have been looking for a gold highlighter
that you're like that you've been
wanting but all the shades I've been to
gold I would check out Uranus I chose
this shade in mind of different skin
tones and different complexions and
things like that so for me I am a fair
complexion I really wanted to have a
highlight that was gold and you can tell
that it was gold but I wasn't going to
look literally gold when I'm looking
straight on it was gonna be a gold
 streak on my face also it is
gold so it's it looks so nice on
different skin tones I absolutely love
it I'm so proud of it you guys oh my god
so in case you guys did not know Uranus
is the part two of the collaboration
that me and Geoffrey did I collaborated
with jeffree star cosmetics and we came
out with a highlighter named Eclipse and
it was a really beautiful high intensity
pink shade I wanted to make a gold
equivalent to that exact shade and
that's what we did I believe that it's
still available in the bundle I think
our individuals are already sold out but
if you guys can check it out it's such a
 stunning ass shade I love it I
hope you guys love it as well blush I've
been loving this is from dose of colors
this is the blush like you mint it this
is from their Mint collection I don't
know if it's still in stock I hope it is
please this blush is in the shade
amazement you guys it's a blush I'm
wearing right now it's literally the
only blush I've been wearing for the
past like two months which is it right
here this is the bush it's like such a
pretty soft apricot pink color right
here it just gives you such a nice
lifelike sheen it's not like shimmery
but it's not matte either it's just a
beautiful color I did an entire
mint collection that was so
sickening and I would definitely highly
suggest getting this blush because it's
stunning it's a Fitz burning
it's we can't do any better and
last but not least in be a favorite
section I want to talk about this really
quickly because I'm so obsessing
this is the Too Faced Born This Way
ethereal setting powder you guys I have
been using this powder non-stop since I
got actually since Laura told me to get
it I try things that other Beauty
youtubers talk about and say that they
really really love because honestly
there are so many new differ
products that come help so often and
it's a literally impossible for you to
try things out over and over again and
just continuously every single day it's
impossible and I'm like okay cool she
said that she loved it okay let me try
let me try it I tried it and honestly I
have not used my laura mercier or my
coverfx powder since I tried the Too
Faced ethereal powder it's the most
beautiful like filtered ass powder I
don't know what the is in there I
don't know what kind of
witchcraft is in there I don't know what
kind of gooey is in there I
don't know I don't know you know but all
I know is that it's amazing it gives you
a beautiful soft filtering effect you
can bake with it it sets your makeup
beautifully I feel like it makes my like
smile lines they crease less when i'm
using it the whole powder is just
 great you get 17 grams of
product in here I'm not kidding you if
you guys are in the market for a new
powder that you need for the face
something that's going to set your
makeup in place but not like be too
heavy either because it's not a heavy
powder by any means I don't know I don't
really know okay guys and now we're
gonna move on to the disappointments I
don't like to be doing that so first
disappointment that I have not really
been loving I actually have three this
time because it's been a while since
I've actually felt one of these the
first one I wanted to talk about that
I'm not really obsessed with are the
Fenty beauty of matchsticks honestly and
the reason I don't really like them is
because I feel like they're a little bit
too hard to use I feel like they're much
more of a like harsh intense consistency
it's like you have to really drag them
to get any product I'll gifts are really
like and I feel like it takes off the
foundation and I feel like that
literally is defeating the purpose and
you need to use a brush to apply it or a
sponge or something like that I just
feel like that's literally defeating the
purpose of of it being easier to use
same thing with the highlighting ones
same with the shimmery ones I just don't
think that they're the most practical
and they're 25 bucks if they're like 15
bucks I'd be like yeah you know they're
so great like you can still use it with
a brush but the fact that they are 25
and you can really only use it with a
brush or take off your foundation or
like moves the product too much I'm just
not a huge fan you know I'm just not
really into it
and trust me guys I'm a huge fan of
Rihanna I think she's amazing
and I love Kendall products I'm not
trying to be a bitch and like talk
by any means but I'm not gonna like sit
here and be like I love these
sick when I don't like them you know and
I know I'm sure I'll get people like
hating and something like I can't
believe you don't like something from
Rihanna or like you know like she has
diehard fans I don't
if you're watching this I apologize if
you think that I'm coming for her but
I'm not I'm just being honest I didn't
work for me and hopefully they worked
for you if you guys tried them awesome
maybe I'm using them wrong let me know
in the comments down below if you guys
have them and if you love them how do
you use it to use it with a sponge or
with a brush or do you apply directly
onto your skin like what did you do do
you warm up on your hand first I just
feel like there's a lot of steps or a
lot of things that you have to do to
make these work and I'm not into that I
want to work right away that's what your
next product I want talk about that was
kind of disappointing to me is the Urban
Decay troublemaker mascara this is the
sex proof mascara actually did an entire
video on it this just didn't work for me
it just didn't I feel like it didn't
make my lashes look pretty I feel like I
made my curls sink my lashes lower like
this like literally looking straight
down it was rough I'll leave this video
linked down below if you guys are
interested in seeing it when I was like
talking about like I did a full
demo I literally run it up and down my
stairs like 20 times trying to sweat so
I can prove whether or not it's going to
be sex proof like if you're sweating and
you're doing the nasty and is it going
to like water are your eyes gonna water
you guys is it gonna run down your face
and it totally did now so sound
but yes it's not my favorite mascara
it's is not one out reach for it which
sucks because I think that the component
of this is so beautiful I love the
facets of it I love that it's like a
holographic like sexiness I don't know
I'm just bummed it didn't work it just
like wasn't my cup of tea and I didn't
like the way my lashes looked with it
either so all in all what's not my
favorite mascara and last but not least
is this from Mac the Mac roller wheel
liner y'all can you see the streakiness
of this can you see the streaks in that
do you see that you guys I tried I
really tried I also did a separate video
on this as well I really try it to make
this work I really did but honestly I
feel like it's very very hard to use
it's not very user friendly when you're
trying to drag from the wing coming back
in it's so hard to use but it's crazy
because they're not so many comments
when people saying that they absolutely
loved it and that I worked so easy on
them and that they had on they have a
hard time doing a regular liner with
like a felt tip liner or hymn brush but
this was really really easy for them so
honestly if you guys are a beginner and
maybe you guys don't really know how to
do a winged liner as much when it comes
to like using a felt tip liner or a
brush maybe this will work out for you
guys I personally did not think they
worked very well just not the most
user-friendly to me and I also think
that the formula itself it's way too
matte it's way too drying it literally
was like cracking my
 i off all I'm saying that that
 was really rough and I
would definitely not suggest it and that
is it you guys that's it for the entire
video that is it from all my hits and
disappointments I apologize again for
not being able to put these videos up as
much when I travel because I just feel
like for me if I'm not trying the
product out enough and I just like like
it like and I just use it once I just
like that's not a favorite I'm sure
other people do that like they'll try it
one time and they loved it like oh it's
a favorite of mine for the month I'm
like yo that's like not even what's
supposed to be when it comes to
favorites videos I mean who knows maybe
it is to them in their world that might
be it but to me I need to use actually a
couple times and like I need to really
fall in love with the product to be able
to put it in my favorites video I don't
know man for me that's just like not my
style I want to try something out a lot
of times before I say it's a favorite of
mine I apologize greatly for not being
able to put these up as much
travel man Travel is a killer I love it
it's such a huge blessing being able to
travel I absolutely love doing it it's
so fun it is intense sometimes
traveling when I have a lot of to
do back home I'm gonna try to do one of
these videos next month I'm not gonna be
traveling as much so hopefully I can try
more products out and we will see what
you think
if you guys are down let me know in the
comments bar below if you guys like
these kind of videos let me know I will
definitely continue to do them or I'll
try to do them much more often but other
than that you guys that is it I'll leave
all my favorites linked down below if
you guys aren't interested in trying any
of them but yeah it's time to I gotta go
I gotta go to Nevada real quick I love
you guys so much how great was that a
night or day wherever you guys are and I
will catch you guys in my next video bye

vamos going kendo y'all did dad
you honey game go ahead swatch it like
Ken me Uranus is right here you
don't playing we really did that girl we

that the formula itself it's way too
matte it's way too drying it literally
