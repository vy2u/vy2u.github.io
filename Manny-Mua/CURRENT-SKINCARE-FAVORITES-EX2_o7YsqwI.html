at today's video is going to be my
current skincare favorites my current
skincare routine what I do every single
night before bed I get a lot of
questions all the time about my skincare
because I had to switch it up pretty
often but I've come up to this routine
that I've been using for the past ik 4
or 5 months and I absolutely love it and
I have not gone astray from it and I
have not been breaking out as much as I
usually do which is really really really
really why I've been sticking to this
routine and I just really fucking love
it so much and it really works for me
very very very well so I noticed it
would be kind of long because I'm going
to be going through each step of what I
do so I'm going to go ahead and go right
into it as always if you guys want this
video guys like me please don't fucking
watch it you know the drill with that
you know with that but you got eggs
video please give it a thumbs up and
subscribe to my channel if you want
already and if you're new what's up I'm
Annie Mui and welcome to my channel
thank you so much for being here I
really appreciate it today I'm wearing a
mesh top a mesh shuddhi hi guys my name
is Manny this is the color I like to be
this is my real color great I'm happy we
established that great let's go and move
on to my current skincare so the first
thing I like to do with my skincare
routine is wash my face of course I wash
the face every single day morning and
night and what I used to wash my face is
the Korres Greek yoghurt foaming facial
cleanser so this is literally my fourth
one that I've gone through I absolutely
love this cleanser so much it's so
gentle it does not strip my skin of any
moisture it's absolutely amazing
I literally have like two empty bottles
in the bathroom right now I'm gonna go
get it ha ha I told you I literally have
so these two are completely empty and
this one still has some product in it I
absolutely love the Korres cleanser it
takes up all the dirt and grime but it
doesn't strip my skin whatsoever it
feels very very very moisturizing it's
just a beautiful face wash and I
honestly would not have gone through 4
if I didn't love it to death this is my
Heaven Sent for a cleanser so right
after I cleanse with my foaming cleanser
what I like to do is I take the tacha
polished gentle rice enzyme powder and I
exfoliate with this night and day this
is literally like all I have left from
this like I go through this motherfucker
this is my second one I go through this
literally so much because I use at night
and day and it's meant to be used night
and day so what you do it's a little
powder as you can see
a little powder and what I'd like to do
is at one place is cleansed and wet I've
dumped some of the powder in my hand
make it emollient like you really want
to like do this and scrub and make it
into a actual foam that's what's gonna
coil your skin you don't want it to be
grainy like that's the great the
granules are gonna be too harsh on the
skin what you wanna do is you want to
make it into a foam literally cleanse
your skin as if you're cleansing it with
a cleanser I just feel like this really
exfoliates my skin so beautifully
without being too harsh and it does not
strip my skin again if you want a gentle
exfoliator that's very very nice and it
cleans your skin so well without it
being too harsh check out the rice
enzyme powder by tacha it's absolutely
beautiful so my next step on dry skin
once I've cleansed my skin I'm
officially it's officially cleansed and
clean and babies ask great so we're
gonna do next is I'm gonna be taking the
etosha the essence this is a new step
for me I've been using for the past two
months this is such a new concept to me
leave an essence I never really heard of
an essence I never tried in essence
before I never really knew an essence
was and so basically what it is it
basically allows your other skincare to
penetrate deeper that's kind of what
it's for that's what was explained to me
as so basically I do is I put this like
two two pumps of it like boom boom on my
hand do this and I literally press into
the skin on dry skin press it into the
skin and let it soak and absorb into my
skin and allow my skin to basically just
be more receptive to receiving the skin
care that's coming next so basically
this is like a catalyst this is a
plumping skin softener 98.7% how to c3
anti-aging complex I had never used an
essence before it and the glow thing
about this too is like it you get so
much bang for your buck in this product
like I literally been using it for two
months straight and I barely got do any
product on if you guys can see in it
it's kinda see I really do feel like
it's a catalyst for my other skincare
and it really really helps my other
skincare penetrate even deeper obsessed
so once my essence is on and I'm nice
and plumped and ready for more skincare
I go in with the lush tea tree water so
what I love about the tea tree water
it's a toner and I really really like to
use this because I am oily and acne
prone and tea tree is an agent to help
prevent acne and help keep your oils at
bay throughout the day thinking Brooks
or very very very well if I feel like
I'm getting a breakout happening I'll
spray a little bit extra of the tea tree
water on my face and I really really
does help ensure that my skin does not
break out as much as it could have
because the teacher really keeps that
acne at bay and it really fights the
acne and I'm like thank God for tea tree
Patrick was
want to introduce me into chichi water
and I was like girl girl I don't know
how this works if you're dry because
this is for more oily skin there's a
little bit more of a harsher ingredient
but I do use products that are so so so
hydrating that I don't really notice it
drying at all whatsoever
like I couldn't really tell you because
it doesn't really drive me out at all it
just really helps prevent my acne from
breaking through so what's like toners
settled in and it starting to absorb
into my skin I like to go in with my
serum and my eye cream so what I like to
use are these bad bitches are her I use
the Kiehl's midnight eye recovery
Kathleen was when I turned me on to this
one it really really helps prevent
darkness underneath my eyes that's all
you really use it for I don't only use
it for anti aging or wrinkles I just use
it to prevent the darkness underneath my
eyes and it really does help this like
the third bottle I've gone through and
I've noticed that when I'm using this I
do notice less blue hue underneath my
eyes I don't know how I don't know how
restorative concentrate of essential
oils and botanicals for fresher younger
looking eyes I just feel like it really
does restore my eyes and my time and I
wake up and my eyes aren't as blue and
puffy and gross as they could have been
without it so I notice that when I am
using this it really does work for the
darkness underneath my eyes and for my
serum I cannot live without this this is
the Sunday Riley good jeans
all-in-one lactic acid treatment this
brightens exfoliates plumps lines
reduces the appearance of
hyperpigmentation and instantly boosts
radiance literally all the fucking
claims are true I talked about this in a
favorites video recently this is my
second bottle and it's almost gone yeah
I uses every single night I really do
notice a massive difference in my
routine after I started using good jeans
I don't know how it changed my skin so
much I thought my skin looks more
raining the lines of my skin have been
diminished I feel like the pores have
got a little bit smaller everything
about this I feel like has really helped
my skin care so much if you're looking
for a good a serum that's a promise that
I feel you're really gonna notice a
difference in your skin like an actual
real radiant different check out the
Sunday Riley good jeans it's so fucking
bomb all the things here I feel like
this is like my favorite item honestly
like it's just so good so once my serum
and eye cream has settled into the skin
it's looking very plump and beautiful
and just chilling I'm gonna go in with
Sunday Riley UFO oil this little bad
bitch right here is a little green oil
and I use it for fighting acne you guys
might have acne prone skin I break out I
have a breakout going on right here
here like I have bumps on my skin I have
a lot of texture and I do things because
I really wanna prevent the texture from
being much worse than it could possibly
be and I found this oil this is for oily
acne prone skin it's at 1.5% salicylic
acid treatment oil doctor use my serum I
put this all over the skin and let it
settle into skin for about two minutes
before I go with my next step I really
do notice a huge difference with using
this as well for acne if you guys are
acne prone check this out it's a really
really easy step and it really works so
so well fast-acting quick-drying
medicated oil clears acne and blackheads
causing build-up and debris from
congested pores for smoother blemish
free skin oh we have some tea tree oil
line into all these claims I feel our
care completely true I really do feel
like it clears out my pores makes my
pores look a little bit smaller it
clears out all the dead skin it really
does actually worked and I feel like my
blackheads are less noticeable and less
there when I'm using this oil two or
three drops of the whole face you're
good to go
amazing two more steps I know I'm sorry
this is a very very very excessive
nighttime skincare routine but it
fucking worked I have not straight from
it and it has not done me wrong that
I've been honestly really really really
really happy with my skin recently and
I'm like I know it's this routine
because I've not switched up anything
after I put on my dry oil I'm gonna go
in with a moisturizer this is the
Kiehl's pure vitality skin renewing
cream this is so so amazing I actually
discover this over the last two months
between all the steps what I actually
change out the most is the moisturizer
the moisturizer is the one that I like
interchange between different brands but
everything else I pretty much keep
consistently the same the moisturizer is
what I changed after I found the Kiehl's
pure vitality renewing cream I haven't
really switched out my moisturizer at
all I've only been using this because it
works so well
this is infused with red ginseng root
and manuka honey and it's reduce skin
for smoother texture and healthier
radiance I love a smooth radiant skin
I love smooth radiant skin that is a
gold mine that eyes honestly what I want
to have smooth radiant skin is this a
fucking heart is for fucking smooth
radiant skin so I like to use products
that will help me achieve the smooth
radiant skin and manuka honey is also
great for acne as well honestly notice
that what I'm using this the next day my
skin is so so plump and so smooth and it
just feels so hydrated I mean is a
heavier cream you don't need a lot of it
at all you literally just get like a
little tiny fucking
and two peas sighs rub it in put into
your face and massage it in it feels
wonderful it's very heavy cream though
if you guys are not into heavy
moisturizers for nighttime I wouldn't
really grab this because it is heavier
of a cream but it really does like
moisturize the shit out of you
I absolutely love it and I would
definitely suggest it I promise you it
works very well and last but not least
one more item one more item so the last
step is this oil by Sunday Riley this is
the Luna sleeping night oil this is a
retinoid oil that reduces the appearance
of pores and wrinkles while fighting the
signs of premature aging and redness it
said it all it said it all I know is
that with this oil working hand-in-hand
with the serum and with the other oils
and with the essence I just feel like it
really does help keep my smile lines at
bay keep the lines underneath my eyes at
bay I just feel like my skin has just
been looking a lot more clear and pretty
and radiant and I do really feel like
it's because of the Nile after I used it
once
I couldn't stop using it I literally
have gone through three of them it's so
so good it's so plumping it's so
hydrating and it does again it makes
your skin smooth and it radiates your
skin and that's all I fucking one
amazing cure honestly of all the brands
here Sunday Riley has really like beat
the pussy up really just works so
freaking while sunny Riley products I
love you I wish this video is sponsored
by Sunday Riley I work can pay for
something you love it that's a goal
that's goals right there Sunday Riley
hit it boy up yeah you guys I hope you
guys enjoyed this skin care routine what
I've been using for my skin care I get a
lot of questions about what my favorite
sinker has been I've been getting a lot
of comments when you guys say that my
skin has been looking a little bit
better than it usually is and I honestly
thank you so much I really appreciate
that so much I really really do that
makes me feel so good but I do think
that's because of this routine that I've
been using and I know it's an excessive
routine I understand that I really do it
is so much and it's an expensive house
routine and I get it but this is what's
worked for me and you guys have been
asking me what I personally use I'm not
gonna just bring out some random
drugstore moisturizer because it's cheap
and I don't even use it you know what I
mean like I understand that this is an
expensive routine and I apologize for it
but it does work for me
and I'm not gonna lie about another
product that I'm not using just to make
someone happy you know I mean this is
what I'm using this
works for me and I wanted to share what
it works for me to you guys and I hope
you guys enjoy this video and hope you
guys learn something from it and hope
you guys can take some of these skin
care items and actually use them if you
guys want to honestly would suggest to
go to Sephora get samples of them do not
buy them full price right away they're
expensive skin care is really expensive
it's something you need an invest in but
I feel like your skin will look great
the makeup look great on top of your
skin if you do in mesons skincare that
works for you skin care is honestly
about finding a routine that works for
your skin it's not about like this
routine for me it may work for being
fantastically but it could not work for
someone else
I don't you know what I mean so this
just works great for me and I hope it
works well for you if you guys ever try
any of these things and so I don't have
any affiliates for any of these products
I wish I did it would be so nice to be
able to get you guys to code to save
some money on the skincare because it
skincare is fucking expensive but maybe
that'll be a future thing maybe it maybe
I can make an final code somehow or
maybe a brand will want to do affiliate
with me I don't know I don't know maybe
but for now I don't have any codes for
these brands and I apologize for that
but they work they're amazing I'm not
sponsored by any of these products
either I wish I was a worship bitch was
but I'm not
these are just the things that work for
me fantastically okay guys so I love you
