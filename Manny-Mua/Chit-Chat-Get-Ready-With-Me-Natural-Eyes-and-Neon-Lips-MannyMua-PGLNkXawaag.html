today's video is going to be a fun just
talk through video you guys know there's
my favorite I love to do get ready with
me and these are my favorite kind of
videos to film lately I've been doing
super glam super smoky eyes for the
holidays the holidays just passed and I
was doing like really intense makeup
looks for the eyes so I really want to
kind of switch it up and do a more
natural eye with more of a bold fun lip
I haven't done a look like this in a
while and I love how they look to make
me look more tan like they make me look
more like festive I don't know I
don't know the word I don't think
there's anything else to say hmm
besides if you guys don't like this
video if you guys don't like me please
definitely watch it you know the drill
with Hannah so we think I've been
getting questions about why I say if you
guys don't like it don't watch
it I really I mean I think it goes
without saying but what I mean by it is
that haters choose to comment on videos
like if their choice they're watching
the videos by choice I'm not forcing you
to click Play so if you guys don't like
me if you guys don't appreciate what I
do you guys don't like the way I look
you guys only the way I sound or
anything you don't have to watch the
video and you don't have to send me hey
you know it's like a choice and whether
they could play or not so that's why I
say it every single video just a
reminder of yo its you clean my videos
I'm not freaking forcing you to click it
so if you guys like this video and if
you guys don't like me please just don't
let me watch it cuz there's no point
that's why I say in every single video
just to remind the bitches that I'm the
boss yo family okay but if you guys do
like this video and you guys do like me
please like this video and subscribe to
my channel if you aren't already and so
let's go ahead and get into this festive
little look
so let's go and start this get ready
with me I challenge like to check carry
with me my style you guys know how it is
I love to do like top throughs and to
check every with Me's and whatnot
let's go and start getting to make it
because you know I ramble like a crazy
crack whore because the first things
first we're gonna start with the
foundation I've already primed I did the
benefit Porefessional on my face I love
that primer
I love silicon based primers because I
am more on the oily side crack an egg on
my face fried in the Sun oil so Maylene
sent out a bunch of foundations out to
like a bunch like Beauty vloggers and
stuff like that and they decided to send
me a couple of their new dream velvet
soft matte hydrating foundation so I'm
so excited to try this out
they sent me all the shades except the
shade 30 which I think I'm going to be
so what we're gonna do is gonna have to
mix 15 and 40 to get my show you I
haven't tried eight it's actually my
first time trying it so I'm gonna put
more a 15 and like a dollop a little
dollop of 40 right now we're after that
it's like a very mosy very very muchi
consistency it's very moosie it's a
weird like this kinda reminds me of the
Tarte foundation like you know the Tri
foundation is like very like thick and
like kind of viscous this is exactly how
this one is this is like a mousse like
I'm talking like if you were to get like
a Yelp lay yogurt that's whipped that is
what this I it's wit that's what it is
it's a whipped foundation oh my god
hello left when I'm smart I'm just gonna
use a Beauty Blender to pet it in
coverage I would say is a nice like
medium to full buildable hmm I think
it's really really pretty it's very
natural for a mattifying foundation it's
very natural-looking and I think I enjoy
this the and I like this foundation
to be really really great for other
people's skin types like a bunch of skin
types because of the fact that it is a
mattifying foundation but it's hydrating
at the same time and so even if you're
like dry I bet you can give uses I mean
not that I know because I'm not dry so I
can't like I mean don't take my word for
it I mean bug I feel like you definitely
would be for sure cool so it's going to
conceal the under eyes because I split
tags today Wow
I'm going with the NARS radiant creamy
concealer in the shade custard I used to
be actually quite obsessed with this
concealer when I worked at Sephora
obsessed with this concealer it's a
beautiful concealer full coverage
minimal creasing like I really truly do
love it and then on top of that I'm
going with the L'Oreal magic
Lumi brightening pen I really like
brightening pens especially like ones
like this L'Oreal pen come through bitch
come through I'm just blend that
bitch out I have no freaking idea when
this videos me going up because I'm
pretty filming like a madwoman
I'm Way out of town I'm going to Hawaii
which I am so excited to be doing I'm
going out with my friends
sorry need set this mug real quick go
ahead and grab the laura mercier
translucent setting powder this is the
chance of someone not the secret
brightening and I'm actually gonna use
that to set I've been using this a lot
to set my under eye recently I love the
secret brightening of course you guys
know this I'm obsessed but I've been
really liking the UM translucent for
underneath my eyes recently just like
recently I don't know and then I'm gonna
set the face with an e 41 brush by
morphe part of the new elite collection
brushes you guys know I've been raving
about them because I love their new
leads I mean I love the early collection
in general obsessed I'm just go and
press that in over the skin very lightly
actually I'm not gonna go ham like I
usually do with the powder taste any
more of like a natural and natural full
coverage on me but I will use Studio Fix
for the neck to kind of match up the
face and the neck because I'm so pasty
you guys I'm a pasty bitch I'm so so so
light so I like to really you know like
match my face in my neck I like to match
him
you know usually people do pickle it's
going bronze up the skin taking hoola of
death and then taking a more PM 5 to 7
brush it's just a nice little paddle

this is such a hugely hectic month for
me I just kept piling on bronzer as I
was talking so what the did I just
do I look like a crazy-ass bitch well as
bronzer on Kat Von D shade + light
banana shade of course my favorite
frickin highlighting shade of life go
into our highlighting underneath the
eyes of course I love doing this and
then I'm taking this shade up here I'm
gonna kind of carve out that wrong so
that we had going on right now I kind of
want to make it a little bit more clean
a little bit more sharp and define I
don't feel like cooking and then we're
going consultation with the makeup geek
chiseled cheek brush and this shade
right here by the Kat Von D shade +
light you guys want to see the shade and
light palette is like top s quality top
contouring palette that I've used all
year I'm obsessed
let's go and start carving up that
cheekbone carve it out so hard that a
carpenter would hit you up like
carve it out okay so now it's going to
highlight this skin I am so excited to
be using this product I'm retaking the
glow kit by anastasiya they just watch
these I'm so excited I cannot wait to
use them look they're like look how
freakin sickening they are Ivan put them
on my face yeah I just watched them but
not on my face but like swatch and they
look sick so we're gonna grab bubbly on
a morphe M 5 10 brushes to my favorite
highlighting brush I just love it we're
gonna load that bitch up oh I like it
hey texture what's up nice to meet you
my name's Manny dude uh Nastasia killed
it with these highlighters honestly I
mean honestly when I saw Nastasia not
kill it with the product let's be honest
she slays everything so number one blush
up the skin a little bit just a little
bit of blush between the highlighting
contour just to kind of even it all out
together I'm going to grab a morphe 4
and then I'm gonna take gingerly blush
by Mac I'm really into Mac blushes
lately and I just I love them put it
into a very light O'Hara blush your film
blue great until the face is completely
done I'm gonna go and start with the
eyes now the fun exciting part I mean
the Atacama that exciting because I want
to do more of a neutral pretty eyes so
that's it so you can do the brows on
camera but because I got this new
product I really really wanted to try it
today and I want to show you guys how it
looks so this is the new Anasazi eyebrow
definer this is their newest pen so it
looks like this as like a sharp edge to
it like you can see it's like a little
like it's like a slant I'm really
excited I have not tried this out yet
usually I like to do brow gels only like
I don't really ever do like that much on
the brows to be honest anymore I used to
be like really grill intense real carved
out I mean I just kind of stopped doing
that because it's not my thing so now
I'm just going to use this and start
trying it out you can literally make
brow hair strokes with this like this is
crazy
honestly I love I just like it makes my
brows look so much more defined I think
this is definitely gonna be an awesome
product front of sauciest line I'm
loving it so far like I'm not kidding
I'm obsessed okay cool so the brows are
completely done I ended up using the
brow definer only and I underlined them
with concealer and I think they look so
good honestly I'm so impressed with a
brow definer so I asked on Twitter and
on snapchat you guys want to see what
palette you guys wanted me to use either
the Too Faced Holiday Collection or the
self made by Nastasia and you guys chose
the self-made palette by an associate it
is stunning stunning palette I'm
obsessed scared me nobody that this
palette does not have which I do need
for every single look as a transition
shade that's completely matte so I'm
just gonna be going in separately with
beaches and cream by makeup geek on an E
27 by morphe and that's just gonna go
into my crease as my base it's like my
base shadow
so lately I've been doing so many smokey
eyes the last two tutorials were smokey
eyes so I'm gonna do it more of a
natural eye today using this palette
which can definitely be done even though
it has like those bold pops of color I'm
gonna do more of a natural high today
because I love you guys have to request
me to do more natural glam on the eyes
I'm like okay natural climate is so it's
going to grab a more feet and 4-3-3
which is like a basically a Mac 217 dupe
remember morphe code mani MUA all caps
saves you 10% off online and in-store
they're my favorite affiliate items I
obsessed I'm obsessed with them so now
I'm gonna grab sherbert which is this
color here it is basically like a warm
orange not just going to go into the
crease it is literally like a satin
finish if you guys are not into satin or
shimmery ish colors for the crease I
totally get it I'm really not into it
either but this color is speaking to me
and I have to use it so originally we
grabbed sherbert which is this claw
right here and then we're gonna grab hot
chocolate which is a shade right here
and after I go in the outer corner just
for some added definition you guys
wanted me to do some natural and
I'm doing natural that's gonna go
about halfway in a Scrabble in color
very chill natural lip color we're gonna
grab a mixture of treasure and pink
champagne which are these two clothes
are here they're very light metallic
almost glittery type shades and I'm just
going to go on the lid with that
Anastacio brush I mean it's right here
it comes with a pallet why the not
and that's just going to go onto the lid
and this is what the top of the lid
should look like it's super easy super
nacho very just pretty I'm gonna go and
finish the top of the eye on the other
side and I'll be right back perfect we
have both of the eyes done it looks so I
think I look so pretty it's a very
pretty very delicate very feminine look
but I do want to doing liner so what's
getting this wing line I never take the
Inglot 77 gel liner my favorite gel
liner and then the Sigma yo six liner
brush
so we have the eyeliner completely done
Ossipon mascara off of camera just
because I want the semester I'm pointing
the benefit roller lash on the top
mascara it's my favorite mascara let's
go ahead and grab sherbert again on a
morphe 35n so brush we're gonna run that
underneath the lash line just a very
small amount of it nothing to ham so
we're just going to run that you 36 with
that sherbert color underneath the lash
line so I mean I do love the eyes I love
that they're very like subdued they're
not too intense they're ready like
natural but I have to do a little bit of
color in there just a little just a
little bit I'm going to be taking a deep
purple this color right here which is
like a neon purple that's awesome and
that's going to go on a43 very very flat
defining brush I love this brush so much
I'm gonna load that up and put that
closest to the lash line just cuz I want
a little bit of pop of color but I don't
want anything to him like I really want
to keep it more natural because I said
that wasn't doing actual look for you
guys so don't blend out those edges a
very very very lightly I don't want to
be like a hard line of purple I want to
be a nice diffused adorable pop of color
kind of purple you feel me
and then on the waterline I'm going to
be putting the Tarte inner rim liner
it's just a nice nude liner and I'm
gonna put on the waterline just kind of
open up my eyes a little bit more than
they are extended play gigablack lash on
the bottom by Mac Ola just give me a
little bit of definition on the bottom
lash line so if eyelashes we're gonna be
taking the new bounce some Serengeti
lashes it's the one in the this
packaging I feel like the Bellas are
living more too dramatic for this look
everyone keeping more natural-looking
Serengeti lashes are very like flaring
very wispy ah okay great so the lashes
are on now I'm gonna go ahead and zoom
you guys in to see what the final height
looks like up close
so since my eyes are so chill and so
laid-back I really want to do it more of
a dramatic loud lips I'm thinking hot
pink or like Nyonya pink I don't know
what kind of fun color this is whatever
I'm going to be taking the new TARDIS
lid paint and the new TARDIS lip liner
um I just got these in recently and I
really wanted to try them out
I've heard that they're very similar to
the NYX matte lip creams because they
are more of a moosie consistency so I'm
excited try them out I'm going to be
taking the lippie pencil in a maze just
broke the thigh thing
it's hard to get a precise line with
these lip pencils though I'm a big fan
of sharpen double pencils because you
can make a straight sharp line these
ones you can't really do that so I kind
of noise me but now let's go ahead and
apply the lipstick I'm using the
lipstick color in so fetch
oh sure this is very like moosie this
definitely moosie texture feels like the
foundation now I put on they feel very
nice this doesn't feel like a very
drying consistency doesn't it's not like
the honest hacia ones or like the dose
of colors or jeffree star these ones are
much more like moosie and they don't I
don't feel like they would like really
dry down like a hundred percent dry but
um they're very very very very
comfortable and I like how they feel
they smell like peppermint it's a right
minty smell but I like them so far I'm
not gonna lie and this is the final look
and that's it that's it for the entire
