today's video is going to be on how to
create this look I have going on right
now it's a really cool purpley cool tone
blue mascara kind of look I love doing
looks like this because I feel like when
you're trying to dabble into color
especially for beginners or those of you
who like to wear neutrals so much this
is such a great way to dabble into it by
using colored liner and colored mascara
you know me like I don't like to just do
neutral looks all the time I like to do
kind of different looks I like to do
like right liner and I like to do like
bright ass blue liner like I think it's
fun to incorporate color and a fun way
like that that's just kind of my style
that's what I like to do and so I wanted
to bring my style bring it down a couple
notches into a little bit more in the
neutral field but still colorful in a
way you know I'm saying
and I think this lip complements this
look so well because it is so neutral
but it says a little a little glisten of
Glaus little awesome glisten you know if
you guys want to see how I created this
look please continue to watch if you
guys know like this kind of video you
guys don't like me don't watch
it you know the true with that you know
the true what that you know but if you
guys do like this video please like it

already better than that look at you to
the story let's do this thing
let's start the shenanigans that are
about to be commenced I don't know I'm
just kind of hyper and the lights are
really bright and I have no makeup on so
we're gonna do a chit chat get ready
with me
that's what one clothes video Tish I get
ready with me first things first we're
gonna go ahead and start off with the
morphe e14 oh by the way brows are
already done and my eyes are pregnant
we're going to start with the morphe 14
and the new battle ash I'm so stoked
about this palette it's so freakin
beautiful and I'm so proud of the girls
from doing this it's just so cool like
it was a collab with the brand like
that's such a huge deal like collabing
what the brand is a huge deal like you
know like clapping what the brand is
such a huge deal I'm gonna go to the
shade vanilla on my morphe 14 and that
isn't be our brow bone highlight powders
are so pigmented like these shadows it's
such a beautiful like matte white creamy
highlight when I use this if I was
darker in tone I don't think I would
because it is extremely light and it
could possibly look ashy on the darker
skin tone girls and boys in the world so
it's need conscious of that also gonna
just take in more feet you 27 and put
that shadow all over that I actually
just kind of set the base I head down
first so I'm gonna go ahead and take
beaches and cream by makeup geek
unexpected by makeup geek combined not
soon to go on a morphine 27 which is
like my obsession blending brush so
we're gonna take that into the crease
this eye look is gonna be soo C so easy
like I'm pretty stoked about it cuz it's
so simple I want the focus to be more on
the liner we're just giving some
dimension to the crease and what not
what not now I'm gonna go ahead and grab
the color Nova which is like a sangria
ish tie trusty purpley that's what it
looks like I can't explain it okay I'm
sorry
and I'm taking morphe a 4-3-3 and I'm
gonna do a very small little dash of
that nothing to Chrissy just a slight
outer corner definition heading like
very slightly can you see that these
freakin shadows are pigmented as
well sub sauce hug hey I'm just a that's
slightly into the crease very slightly
because I don't like shimmery colors in
my crease it's just not my thing and
then take that same key 27 and blend out
those edges take a little bit more of
the black from that palette I'm the more
feet and 4-3-3 and just slightly push
that in to the outer corner only
the little baby strokes baby motions i'm
gland
oh ye i'm actually gonna go ahead and
grab an e 23 play morphe i'm just gonna
kind of clean up those edges just kind
of blend out any harsh lines that might
be there even if there aren't harsh
lines I have a weird obsession with like
making sure that everything is like
blended like to filth and perfection
like blended to fail you know there you
go I feel better about myself now I feel
like it's more blended there's a lot of
like extra darkness out here but it's
really Maddox I'm doing a wing anyway
and I haven't even done my face yet
doesn't matter now for the stars and
those show the new benefit they're real
push-up liner in the shade purple I love
this color I love a deep deep deep
purple liner I think it's absolutely
beautiful the they're real liners and
they're real mascara is the new ones
come out today I am a benefit pretty
committee member so I have it Ellie as
you guys know previously I've told you
guys that already so I'm really stoked
that they came out today should
definitely check them out I love the
brown and the purple one the most I'm
gonna use a purple right now I'm gonna
take the little purple all you do is
crank it and go on in
if you want it today cuz we're going to
get and Beyonce's dies cool I'm just
gonna take a little bit concealer on a
flat brush and I'm just gonna clean up
that wing because I want it to be
slightly thinner on the outer corner you
know okay cool so this is what the top
of that I should look like a nice purple
intense line are giving the attention of
the Pete's
creases nice and neutral sounds good I'm
gonna go finish the top of the eye on
this side real quick and I'll be your
back so I'm gonna go ahead and do the
bottom lashline after I do my face and
foundation I am gonna be using one of
the new benefit mascaras so stay tuned
for that way I need to the face first
because obviously I can just do like
mascara and then to concealer because
it's just not kind of work trust me cool
so I'm already primed my face is primed
with the Smashbox primer water I'm gonna
be using my love of my life did your air
flash 300 obviously 309-347-1728 or
brushed finish like we really know that
and I'm just pressing it and I'm not
like whirling in circles or anything
like that I'm just really pressing it in
to give me the coverage I want as well
as kind of go into my little pores and
the nasty that I want to be covered
press that bitch in I think that's why I
like using it what this brushes cuz it
presses on foundations so nicely and so
just like flawless and every single a
shaper for him notice that my neck is
pale as um because I'm pale and
that's why I like to wear higher shirts
and have any clean shirts today so I
have to wear this one which makes me
expose my neck a lot more I don't like
to be as pale as my neck is I just don't
I like to be a little bit more tan on
the face just in case people are
wondering like why the hell is your
foundation with way darker than your
neck because I want it to be I'm gonna
take a little bit on my neck the liquid
I'm not gonna I'm skin to get I mean I
don't care usually I don't take a look
at somewhere neckla thug life I'm going
to get down to like my beard area and
then I'll use a powder for the rest of
my neck and don't forget your ears
I always forget my ears I am 95 no I'm
99% sure that this is the prettiest
foundation that I own it just looks so I
die I die I die a thousand deaths okay
now for the under eyes we're gonna be
using
nation of Urban Decay way this concealer
combined with my Mac prep and prime I
didn't always I love this combination
it's so full coverage feels absolutely
amazing it looks really really really
nice and the Mac prep and prime really
dilutes the concealer and it makes it
look so much brighter and prettier and
this is why I didn't do mascara on the
bottom because I was gonna be doing this
step imagine painting isn't on mascara
like that's not you and then I'm gonna
use my morphe g2 and press this in you
guys know I love me some g-tube Lenny
morphine
I'm gonna take that all the way back
very dragged very drag all the way up to
the lash line and up to the eyeliner but
very carefully don't with the
lineup because it will mess up and they
will bite Junia now it looks really
bright and luminous in that section let
me go ahead and set that business in the
governor because I welcome you okay now
I'm gonna go in take the morphe m4 3/8
which is the setting brush I always use
for like literally everything and my
little book Laura Mercier translucent
powder know what seduction illusion this
is a secret brightening powder I get a
good old dollop I gotta love this
honestly I just love it I'm just gonna
press that in over my concealer and now
my under eyes are set well one is this
one is the weak side and this is the
don't with me it's 3 in the morning
side cool awesome of the both of the
eyes are now concealed and brightened
and look so much better than what they
were I'm actually gonna go and use the
Mac prep and prime pin the light boost
to tell you more of the face I mean why
the hell not I'm gonna here g2 it's just
to kind of help balance out the rest of
the face when you highlight other parts
of the face it really helps balance out
everything instead just doing it under
the eye helps when you highlight other
parts of the face so it doesn't look so
like gnarls barkley you know we are
highlighted and beaten to death beat to
death we're gonna take the morphe g0
which is my favorite powder brush
basically of all time now it's
everything it's everything it's like a
big this thing and everything so
I'm gonna take me Mac medium mineralized
skin finish with mg0 and I'm just gonna
press that all into the face just set
the foundation I love the mineralized
skinfinish to set the do our air flash
because it gives you a luminous not
stuff not a luminous it gives you like a
nice satin finish so I love using the
mineralized skinfinish what to do or
flesh I think it looks and it's so like
full coverage but like pretty full
coverage you know if I were Pro
finishing powder and 1:18
same g0 and I'm gonna take that down my
neck just kind of help blend it together
with the super lightness of my decollete
because I'm having to get so many
call-outs with how weird my body looks
compared to my face that's better right
now looks like much more like conjoins
like I'm the same actual color instead
of being a pasty ghost down here and
like I'm drunk gotta stop here we're
going to take the bronzer in Houla
little Hulu who's the loom and I'm gonna
take that money morphe - so the bronzer
brush I use for literally everything and
I'm just gonna press that into the
temples in my face I run that in I like
this bronzer a lot because I feel like
it's kind of neutral it's not too warm
it's not too cool it's just a nice
neutral bronzer that's Matt great for
men great for men it's more bronze on my
right thigh top here I need like a
little clip from my hair girls can use
Clips I don't get to clip my hair
wouldn't say clip back though mmm
cheekbones so I go take the shade and
light palette by Kat Von D on my same
more feet and for 3/8 and I'm just gonna
take that banana shade and press that
into the under eyes of my eye there so
kindly bring some more brightness and
light back to my face I love using this
banana sheet because it's so brightening
and also kind of makes it look more
sharp like I have more cheekbone than I
really do because I really don't really
don't so have to kind of fake it with
bronzer and contour and highlight now
I'm gonna go and take my morphe e3 brush
and I don't take Tarte blush today I'm
gonna use part cuz I love turned blushes
they're beautiful I'm gonna fall I'm
gonna take the color blissful which is
this a little daring for me thanks it's
a little daring I don't ever use blushes
of this color I'll just do a little bit
me tap that's nice it's really beautiful
together
rosy to the rosy pink this blush is
really giving it to me right now
obviously this is not a look without a
highlighter so jorah cosmetics launched
another alright this one's in the shape
of Audrey it's like a white gold when I
take it out and working at 5:01 load the
brush up slightly because they are it's
really pigmented so be careful I'm gonna
highlight with this mm-hmm yeah I know
some of this color reminds me of reminds
me of NARS albatross it has like that
really golden intense sheen but it's
like a white powder
I think it's so
beautiful oh my god I can't tell if I
like this one or Marilyn more it's I
feel like highlighter is like dope one
thing that must be like pickle let's go
and finish the bottom of eggs now
because the face is basically done I
just need two lips after but let's
finish sighs so the bottom of the eyes
are gonna be pretty freakin simple and I
mean like simple as I'm gonna take
beaches and cream mix without
interrupted I'm just gonna run that on
the outer corner of my eye with a
beautiful beautiful
a36 more for you pencil brush my
favorite pencil brush of Atlantis like
stone I'm gonna gonna take a little bit
of the battle ash black again on the
same pencil brush and I'm wearing that
on the outer corner of my eye just like
darken it slightly I'm just gonna
feather that forward I don't want a lot
of pigment there I just want a little
bit of definition on the outer corner
not so much like black color I think
that's all those kind of smokey on the
outer corner but it's not too crazy not
crazy but it's still smoking now's a
benefit they're real mascara in the
shade blue and I put the blue on the
bottom lash line I think you'll just
make the look like how do I come
together in a cool way
I don't know if like a nerd cuz this
blue is so vibrant to them like yes like
yo be careful because obviously like
this is a big-ass one just I want to be
careful applying that blue and it should
look like so see these launched a as
well as I said earlier but I think looks
absolutely beautiful and I love blue
mascara I love blue mascara people so
the blue mascara is on the bottom lashes
now and I haven't put any on the top
because I'm not gonna do blue mascara on
top putting like colored mascara on the
top is not really my style so I'm just
going to stick to my favorite mascara of
light roller lash mascara from benefit
I spent a second rows and everything and
I have it works really good for me
honestly it's so good
yes mascara I'm gonna take the new bound
some lashes in the style Devon Rex which
is like these weird flared really cool
ones you know I've never had one of
these lashes before their brain
something about new lashes that makes me
just like mmm like happy you know
they're so natural what the this is
what the lashes look like this is with
one on it's like a little lifter flared
in the center and the reason I decided
to do more of the natural lashes because
I want the focus to be on the liner I
really want people to tell that I have
purple liner on and
I think with a really thick lash band
it's a lot harder to tell but this is
what the yeah and this is the look with
the lashes on the lashes are so adorable
like there's really like cute and flurry
and not too intense whatsoever
I wanted attention I want in fears it's
because the Bellas are sold outside I
want to talk about them but next time
I'm talking about them I don't even care
don't even get to my favorite let's just
pray that Muse mean I said see what the
final head looks like
Oh Hickel so that was the I look
nowadays the time for the DP so I'm
gonna take my boot Picabo knew true
people new to buy necks that's my lip
Lennon from lashes and lip line are my
favorite part of makeup I think like I
feel like they transform you the most
like whatever this is like they turn me
into that and then I'm gonna go and take
the colour Shella by color pop which is
their newest launch of their little like
summer lion I guess it's like a little
lippy pencil it's a beautiful beautiful
like coral pink like it's like a peachy
coral pink this is what it looks like
just by itself I'm not the biggest fan
of the smell of the colour-pop lippie
stix chart shows like I don't know I
don't know why I just I'm not the
biggest fan of the smell of these so I'm
just go ahead and top it off with candy
kiss Dora cosmetics and gloss which is
actually shine EXO's collaboration color
I've been meaning to use this in this
tutorial but I never was wearing like a
coral lip I wanted to pair this with
it's a beautiful peachy pink nude it's
gorgeous and I'm just gonna use this to
lighten up this color a little bit more
because the focus is on the eyes on the
ojos huge congrats to Shannon XO for
creating this color I think it's
absolutely beautiful and this is what
