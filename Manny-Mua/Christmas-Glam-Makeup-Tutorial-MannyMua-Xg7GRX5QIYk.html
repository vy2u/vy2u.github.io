so yeah without further ado I'll get you
guys to little toriel and I love you
guys all and I'll see you soon
bye okay well let's get this show
started yeah I'm gonna feel like the
lights are really in my face right now
like they're so close to me because I'm
trying to try to zoom in you guys a
little bit more so you can see what I'm
doing so I've been getting couple more
requests to like zoom into that eye area
you know so um yeah we're starting off
with base done I brought that and we're
prime unlit
I don't know how long this is gonna take
so I had to finish the firms because
first we're gonna go in with a
transition color and I'm actually using
something that's not beaches and grains
so this is really weird
I'm going in with soft peach by Anasazi
Beverly Hills and that's in Govan with
an e 40 by Sigma right into our crease
area right up in there this is a mere
transition shade so you don't need to be
neat with the at all these are massaging
shadows are so so so so amazing it's not
even funny so now I'm actually gonna go
in with the Anasazi vanilla vanilla on a
sideshow that's gonna be our brow bone
highlight on a little Sigma e30 tone
right onto our brow bone highlight area
and the only reason I'm doing this is
just like I have a better transition it
looks like basically there's nothing
there that's the train till there's a
lotta okay now we're going to go in with
another color brown sauce yet by ready
you know we're going in with burnt
orange which is this beaut this color so
stunning I'm using so much lately let's
then go into our crease area on a sigma
e30 8 and so I'm just going to put that
in outer corner
using the brush to pack it on and then
buff it and to our crease
what are we have left on the brush kind
of feather it forward and what the most
I want most of the color to be on the
outer corner so then I'll go back in
with the d40 and just kind of blend the
whole thing because blending its funds
on man Saul oh really
am I only have that nice like warm theme
going on now I'm gonna go in with honest
on your buddy Hills shadow and CNF which
is another really warm brown but it's a
lot more red and darker than the last
one I did say me 38 and that's gonna go
a little bit lower then our other color
that we used before you blend it out my
lips feel kind of trapped oh hold on let
me hydrate kiss my honey lip balms
they're everything okay so you're gonna
go in with Anasazi Beverly Hills beauty
mark I shadow on a Sophie 320 what I
love outside is that it's very it's a
buffing brush but it's pointed and it's
really great you're just doing that kind
of precision work and so I'm gonna go
right in on top of Sienna it's just to
kind of make the color a little bit
darker and Sigma e-40 again just a buff
that out even further and I'm just
running a little bit more of Sienna
increase cuz I want to be a little bit
darker
so now I'm really really really really
really really excited to use these
colors right now so we're going to go in
with the new makeup geek oil shadows and
I'm going to be mixing on the lid in the
spotlight with with grandstand so I'm
just going to be dipping my brush into
literally both of them so I'm just
packed out on the lid it's gone we're
just using that same Sigma e30 eight
Diesel's I just really depressed oh my
god these are so beautiful I can't
handle it it's beautiful just like
foiled goodness and just I'll go in with
that same u38 and just kind of buff
around the edges so it doesn't look like
there's like a harsh line what are you
guys thinking so far I think I really
like I know so we're gonna go with
honest logic cream color and lavish
which is like this beautiful mauve
changhie Maroney organdy Brown I'm not
rubbing and I can't explain colors and
she can't she's the queen so I'm just go
in with a morphe m43 so now we're just
gonna run underneath the lash line
of course another we have that there we
have it a Down and we have an i-beam
we're gonna go in with the makeup geek
Showtime foiled shadow which is
beautiful like maroon burgundy color
with a little bit of Sheen obviously
because it's a foil and that we're just
going to pack on top of it on the outer
corner of the lavish liner stop I'm
obsessed
oh love then I'm going to go in with
soft peach again and I'm just going to
run that right underneath the showtime
shadow to give it just a little bit of
transition you know who I am with my
transitions and helps us with them I am
homewards gonna run a bit on there
so we're gonna go in with the morphine
gel liner and the eo6 by Sigma we're
gonna do the little wound I picked up a
 ton of product wipe it off hold up
