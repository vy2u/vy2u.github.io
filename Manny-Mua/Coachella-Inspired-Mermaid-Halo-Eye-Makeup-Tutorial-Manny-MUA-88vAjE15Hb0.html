today's video is going to be a tutorial
on this eye look I have going on right
now it's a really fun pretty dramatic
halo eye I would say it's cute it's
fucking festive this is a fun look I
came up with actually did it look like
this very very very similar maybe like
three years ago on Instagram and I was
scrolling through my constrain feet a
while back and I was like dude this look
is so pretty I want to recreate it so I
did a little bit of a re-creation of it
/ like my own twist on it with how I do
makeup now I just think it's so pretty
it's so easy to do honestly I use like
one palette for the whole like color
scheme I'm all about wearing bold colors
on the eyes actually my thing like I
love doing bold colors on the eyes and
doing a really neutral soft lip I love
that and I know a lot of people always
try to give me slack for doing like the
bronzy smokey eye that whole like bronzy
thing which I love that's like my go-to
I go to events like that's like the
prettiest to be photographed in and
prettiest for carpets I like that that's
why I do X it looks so pretty but I love
to do things like this too and I love to
experiment with color and just do fun
things and that's why I want to create
this video for you guys because I know a
lot of you guys are into color and
glitter and dramatic and glam and it
makes me so happy because that is a
bitch after my own heart
you know I mean as always if you guys
don't feel if you guys don't like me
please don't fucking watch it you know
the drill with that but if you guys do
like this video please subscribe to my
channel if you are not already and if
you knew what's up at mani MUA and
welcome to my channel thank you so much
for being here
that was let's get into this beautiful
mermaid e hallo what's up guys so this
going get started on today's video I
actually have no idea what I want to do
today it's busy just gonna be a get
ready with me on the eye look I'm
actually doing a first impressions on a
foundation that I'm wearing right now
holy crap see I just jumped up here I'm
actually currently doing a foundation
review right now which is why I have my
base already on so I'm just gonna do the
eyes in today's video and I wanted to do
more of a bold eye look today so usually
those take a little bit longer for me to
accomplish so I'm already primed I've
been doing so many halo eyes recently
and a lot of people have been requesting
me to film a halo eye tutorial
so having feminine I don't know like
over a year it's been a long a long time
so I'm gonna do a fun halo eye today
let's just go ahead and start right into
it I'm gonna take a morphe M 505 and
this is just a little fluffy brush take
this little palette by Smashbox it's
totally fun colorful palette which I
thought was really really really
pretty man this is a cute house palette
and I like that has all the brights in
there and I believe they're pretty
pretty pigmented a little while ago no
no while this is like a couple months
ago like a lot of people were doing like
sponsorships with Smashbox a lot of them
are using these Smashbox palettes and
salons check-posts which is great I mean
Helle I did get that fucking coin wasn't
perfect what's not hard that so I'm
going to use a purple dude pigmented and
I'm gonna put that into the crease
mainly in just the crease portion all
the way to the inner part of the eye as
well holy shit this is actually really
pigmented
oh god honestly I'm really impressed
with pigmentation so far come on Lois
mash up a user bum
I want this heel like to be a little bit
more on the colorful side so I thought
purple and the crease would be fantastic
here we got the purple in the crease and
now it's time to put in another go to
zone so now I'm going with that mint
color it's like that really pretty minty
sheet right here on this little pencil
brush dang hella payment to begin on a
morphe m57 for let's go my actual lid
inner corner this is what we're gonna be
starting to do our halo and into the
crease a little bit I'm like actually
praying that this turns out somewhat
cute because if it doesn't it I'm not
putting this up mm-hmm
I know we all know guys I'm living for
this color this mint is so pretty
put a little bit into the crease as well
just to have it there to mix in with
that purple a little bit yeah
leaving the center completely open as
you guys can see oh it's pretty and I'm
gonna take a little clean brush this is
a Wayne Goss 0-5 you don't need to use
this brushes as a very expensive brush
but I just have because it's a really
small tapered brush and I'm gonna blend
between that purple and that mint shade
just so there's a nice easy transition
they blend actually really really nicely
and easy together which is great but
guys this is what you should have so far
a nice purple crease mint on the lid oh
my god ahh so now I'm gonna go ahead and
continue on I'm gonna take that same
little brush that we were using the low
pencil brush I might dip a little bit
into the darker blue the blue or shade
I'm gonna add on the most outer outer
corner and inner corner of my halo eye
you can see right here right oh right
here where the mint
it's the purple honestly I'm only doing
this to add a little bit more depth to
the halo I just make a little bit darker
and on the inner corner as well
lightly mmm okay so I think I really
like how the crease and the eyes turning
out so far they looks very very pretty
being cute so now I'm gonna take the
makeup geek pigment in the shade
telepathic which is a really pretty
golden pink reflect it's stunning and I
met without on the center of the lid I'm
just use my finger with the pigment cuz
it's just way easier that way for me and
then I'm gonna put it in the center of
the lid I'm just gonna blend with my
brush between if you guys thought that
was it you thought wrong I'm gonna take
the steel up magnificent metal glitter
shadow in the shade diamond dust it's a
really beautiful silver but it has a lot
of pink and like gold and reflect to it
so I'm like that's going on the center
of my lid okay in the center of the
center actually like right there to give
it that extra extra extra ah that looks
wet now taking that purple underneath
the lash line I'm going to smoke it on
the outer corner on here nice you can
take it all the way in that's so pretty
dude I'm a colorful little vixen tonight
huh okay guys now for the water Lee I'm
gonna be taking the color pop pencil on
the shape get paid which is a really
pretty rose copper whoa don't get to
decide in there pencil so I'm put that
into the water line as you can see it's
a beautiful rose copper looking at the
purple on the bottom lash line like it's
cute I like it
I do but I don't love it grabbing a
little bit more of the blue
so I actually wanted to lighten the
water line a little bit so I'm taking
the Tarte nude pencil and lining the
waterline to make it a little bit
lighter the wire look is cute okay so
for the final step of the actual look
this is what looks like so far I think
it's turned out so pretty it's so cute
just like a fun look I just left purple
in the crease it just makes me beak you
know I'm to add a little bit of a gem
down here on my lower lashes like right
there I took a really cute trend going
on right now is adding a little gems in
the lower lash line I think it's
adorable so I'm gonna have a little bit
of lash glue I'm literally just going to
dot on lash look where I want to let the
dual gem to go in the center of my eye
so right there not there and right there
you do not even need to do the step this
is so excessive but I'm feeling my oats
right now so whatever a little gym cute
is fuck though okay so now I'm gonna go
ahead and apply some lashes so mascara
and I'll be right back okay guys and
this is how the look turned out this is
with liner and with some lashes on I
wanted the lashes to be pretty bold but
not like crazy bold we couldn't see the
actual eye makeup cuz that's kind of
what the point of this look is and a
little gems I'm wearing the style Bombay
by new bounce um you can use a coat man
you anyway if you guys want to all good
you guys save 20% off of the lashes and
they're absolutely beautiful they're
like a really intense flurry wispy pair
but there's a lot of separation in them
which is great for a look like this
there's a lot of lifting and it just
looks really really really pretty
I'm not liking this foundation by the
way the one that reviewing I'm not
liking it Kylie I am great also on my
lip I'm wearing the nude potion shade by
nikkietutorials and Oprah
congratulations to Nikki and to over 4
Calabrian that so so so cool they did an
entire bundle 3 liquid lipsticks and a
highlighter and I've collaborated with
over before so I know how amazing the
team is over there over on you guys are
so sweet
Congrats Nikki on this collaboration
this is in the shade nude potion and so
she ate I'm wearing right now this nude
is so so nude so if you guys are darker
in complexion than I am
you need to use a darker lip liner
because this is a really
really really nude like I'm talking like
it's almost like white with a touch of
pink tossed in but it feels great it so
for us so congratulations again to you
guys that's so so awesome this is what
the eyes look like up close a little bit
closer and we put them in focus
hey guys that's it for the entire video
because had fun watching I'd have so
much fun creating these halo hi looks I
think they're so pretty I'm actually
really really easy to accomplish if I
just kind of get the right motions down
and the right placement down they're
really really easy honestly they're
easier than doing like smoky eyes when I
