I could go in these giggly gets it so
anyways you guys what is up I'm here
with my dad this is my father
hello oh my god this is literally like
so crazy my dad not only does he never
get in photos with me imagining you
being in video with me is like like my
earth is shattered my earth is flat
right now shout out to you Shane Austin
the reason we both wanted to do this
actually we're both really prompted
Phillip to make this video because we
wanted to talk about our past and our
past struggles growing up with each
other I guess or just kind of like
seeing eye to eye as we're growing older
and as we got older and things like that
and it's Pride Month and we were both so
motivated in my dad it's really really
cool my dad's super motivated to talk
about his past with me and how he is now
with me so it's really really really
really cool and exciting in I'm gonna
stop talking so much imma let my dad
take the floor a little bit later I just
want to say thank you to you for being
so open and wanting to be on my channel
and I love you so much you know that
obviously but I'm really excited I'm
really nervous because this is really
really candid and this is how like me my
dad grew up together and how hard it was
for me you know growing up not having my
parents understand me as much as I
wanted them to and not really being able
to convey that kind to go in and talk
about a story and seeing the major
transformation that it is now it's just
so crazy my dad works with me now he
works with lunar Beauty and a lunar
Beauty is a family business and it's so
so cool but yeah that's what his video
is going to be and let's go into get
right into it
my dad he is so tan next to me it's not
this is I'm my mom's side like face
complexion wise I can't even get dark
so my name is Manny Gutierrez I'm
actually jr. but it's easier for
everybody to call me senior but the
reason I wanted to do this is because
first of all it's it's Pride Month and
that's has a big part of my life now and
it's just certain things I've come up
recently that I've just kind of been
tugging at me and I don't know it's just
this is not me me getting in front of my
camera is definitely not me I even shy
away from steal photos but this is
something that I feel passionate about
and I wanted to share my story because
there was a time in my life where I I
wasn't supportive like that's not how it
is down like that's what's gonna help
you get through it like that's so long
ago we are so strong now I I grew up in
a Latino household my mom and dad raised
me and they they did the best that they
could I love them to death
there wasn't really much topic of talk
and discussions about about the LGBT
community we did have gay family members
in our in our family but to be honest I
was never I wasn't raised a night in a
hateful home but for some reason I grew
up resenting the LGBT community and to
be honest I don't I don't know why me
and my wife of 28 years this year 28
years that's spot unbelievable that's so
amazing she's my soul mate I love her to
death
we've actually known each other since
elementary school we we went to
elementary school together middle school
and a high school
we ended up dating when she was a junior
I was a sophomore so she was a
cradle-robber there cradle-robber for
real we started our family at a very
very young age right out of high school
mm-hmm I believe I was 17 when I had you
so in mom was like yeah but the cusp of
it is somewhere around there we started
very young so it means yeah my boy Manny
is is number one
was the biggest challenge for me he was
always a sweet loving kid had the
biggest heart we both knew there was
something different about him
he played with with him with dolls that
really yeah you did I was a huge
baseball fanatic tried to get him to
play baseball but it was it was
something that total war it was all over
the he did it I believe just out of love
for me and I appreciate that especially
nowadays I look back and I really do
appreciate that so I'm I swear I'm gonna
get yeah you're doing great dad so um we
knew he was he was different like I said
in the beginning I wasn't always
supportive of the LGBT community and me
being this the idiot that I was back in
the day I tried to change him into I
guess you would call a normal boy we
even went as far as taking him to
counseling I was in the mentality back
then that this was a choice I know 100%
now that that that's false he was born
this way I wasn't very educated back
then throughout your life throughout
your upbringing when you got older
things just became harder for me we
started like separating obviously
started hanging out with your friends
more often not being in as a house as
much but understandably so because you
probably you felt disconnected I think
and I want to be as brutally honest as I
possibly can not only did it affect my
relationship with you but it affected my
relationship with my wife as well
obviously she's the mother she's the
mama bear she's caring she was just
being protective of you every time we
would have an argument about it it was
all my fault
100% she was just doing what a caring
mom would do damn dude isn't it
therapeutic though yeah there was no
we're no connection no connection
whatsoever yeah me and my dad didn't
have a normal or I guess quote-unquote
normal like father-son relationship but
we wouldn't go outside and like play
catch and
wouldn't link do these normal bonding
are suppose aasaiya T things as normal
finding the male experiences and it was
because the of the disconnection that we
both had you know my dad
I always felt was trying to like change
me and I always felt like I was trying
to change him to see how I was thinking
so it's like we had this constant
tug-of-war back and forth so instead of
us talking about it's penny tell me so
that we like just disconnected from one
another my parents would argue about it
and they would talk about it amongst
themselves but I would always be
excluded from that because I would
always just excuse myself and I feel
like that's why we had like more of an
estranged relationship I do remember
this one argument and I had with your
mom that really really affected me
because during that argument she just
straight-out told me she says if you
don't change the way you see your son
you're gonna lose him forever and that's
probably that was a turning point yeah
definitely I began like reading just
stuff on the internet about the LGBT
community fathers raising gay sons I
just basically educated myself and this
is that what I would go here I would say
you were probably what 15 14 fixes
before I wouldn't like before I went to
counseling before I technically came out
yeah yes it before then yeah okay
yeah definitely and I don't know when
you started doing makeup to be honest no
I think I was like 21 okay so that's
another that's a whole nother kind of
work exactly
I made the decision with my wife as well
for us to go to counseling for anybody
that's out there listening to this or
viewing this that is in a similar
situation I can tell you that as a
father to father for if you're watching
me you need professional assistance you
need professional help for you to get
through the the roadblocks set you you
mentally have I mean going to counseling
being able to talk to somebody
one-on-one really made a huge huge
impact in my life I was able to open up
about what was bothering me and and and
internally gave me counseling on both on
both sides what Manny was probably
feeling and what I was going through as
well it was definitely needed and I
would highly highly recommend any
parents out there that are struggling
with his
is to go get some counseling in this
process that I took on or that started
within me it was years and years and
years counseling and just trying to
change the way I viewed a certain
individual or individuals it's something
that doesn't happen overnight I promise
you if you give it your 100% you will
see the changes okay so kind of changing
the subject a little bit so I kind of
want to talk about me coming out and how
it was for me basically what happened
was my parents caught me chatting on
MySpace with a dude and it was a very
like what the fuck is going on like they
sat me down we all balled for like days
literally and so basically happen is I
ended up Bing the kid that I am the
people pleaser that I am I decided to go
to counseling for about six months
because my parents suggested it and just
to kinda like talk about it my parents
didn't really know what was going on I
didn't really know what was going on I
was very very confused and then I went
into a depression a couple months into
it and I just started getting more and
more dent off ish I feel like I started
becoming more reserved I start hanging
out with my friends more I spent less
time at home I spent more time in my
room it was because you know I felt like
I wasn't I wasn't doing anything right I
felt like you know I was letting my
family down I feel like I was like my
parents down I feel like I was letting
myself down and I wasn't able to change
but my parents being the awesome parents
as they are approached me and were like
what is going on they noticed my
disconnect I feel you guys like or like
oh my god so I know if I'm disconnected
I told him the truth and I thought that
the counseling was what was making me a
little bit more depressed and that was
sending me into the spiral and so they
told me that not to keep going and I
feel like that was a big moment in our
life and a big moment for us as like me
my mom and my dad when they said that
they just want me to be happy you know
they they wanted that don't mic the old
son back is basically what they kind of
explained it to me as they wanted the
old me the happy me the one that was
exuberant and happy all the time I
stopped going and then we went into like
a big phase of don't-ask don't-tell in
my house we literally never talked about
anything after that for years and years
and years and it didn't really get
brought up until they discovered my
Instagram and that is when like shade
the fan that is when things got a lot
more complicated you know on my
Instagram I had started and dragged or
had started like my makeup career in
drag and that became such a confusing
time for both my mom and my dad and they
were very like I trying to become a
woman in a transition
what like they just didn't understand
what I was doing and why I thought it
was fun and creative and just expressing
a different form of creativity for
myself I just remember the day when you
guys approached me with my Instagram and
I went to a full panic attack full-on
like breathing into a paper bag in my
room not only were we not bad terms but
we weren't
unlike the best primp we were still very
disconnected and we were still very just
like not close in any way but then
throwing this on top of it you know them
seeing me and dragging them just being
like like what is going on like this is
not know what was going on in my life
and I didn't want to tell them either I
didn't want to express it to them so I
didn't want to tell him about me wanting
to play with makeup or working at
Sephora or anything like that because I
didn't think that they would understand
and you know they didn't and they wanted
to delete my Instagram so they did not
get it and it was for solace for me
really for good reason like lying to
them like I told my dad I worked at JC
Penney I did work at disease-fighting
technically it was a Sephora inside you
see penny and I would jump out my window
when I would go to work so that they
wouldn't see me with makeup on and then
I would take off I would have makeup
wipes on my car and I would take off my
makeup before I went into the house so
they would never know that was wearing
makeup and it was just such a weird
crazy time that like even thinking about
that it seems like a different life for
me but when they had discovered my
history and when I started really
getting into makeup was when I thought
things are really hard again we we knew
you were you were gay but the whole
makeup aspect of it just took it to
another level where I wasn't ready for
again your mom being the more caring
more understanding creature yeah the
more understanding person in the
relationship she talked to you and try
to help you through your I guess anxiety
issues that you were having me I was
more standoffish
to be honest I'm embarrassed so that I
feel horrible for for the not the things
I did but the way I behaved the way I
acted towards my son during his
difficult time difficult years
in his childhood and his growing up as a
young man having to go through this
alone I could just imagine this is why
I'm doing it to be honest I want to help
other kids that are going through the
same thing that that Manny went through
I also want to help parents understand
that you can make a change I'm living
proof here that you can make a change
it's gonna take a lot of work and take a
lot of time you can do it it's the same
kid that you you were holding in your
arms and he was a little baby I have
pictures and I didn't tell it Manning I
was gonna bring these but he probably
doesn't want me to show them but photos
I don't give a shit oh my god I'm gonna
do it anyways dad what them so so this
is this is Manny when he was a little a
little tyke a little boy and these are
my two favorite pictures but Lincoln is
that's a sweet smile yeah this kid right
here is the same one in this picture
right here the same man the same boy
that I grew up loving that was one of
the ways I kind of help myself
get through the difficult difficult
times and you probably didn't know this
but I would go look at pictures like
this and I would literally be in the
garage talking to myself saying the kid
that you're you're upset right now at is
the same damn kid in that picture
the quicker you realize that the easier
and the faster you're gonna get to the
point where you can be that supportive
parent and if you're not then go get
some help like that like I did they need
you for the rest of their lives and
likewise I need him in my life for the
rest of my life as well there are
organizations out there that can help
you there are support groups that you
can contact but don't ever ever abandon
your kid keep loving them because they
they are your child you might not always
agree with them because he's a hard-ass
he's a hard-headed stubborn kid but I
will always support him and whatever he
does when you went through that whole
drag phase and in the make up again I
wasn't I wasn't excited about it but
again I was already in that transition
point where I knew if I wasn't a loving
supporting dad I probably would would
have lost you forever so it took me a
little while after because it was like
okay we found out that you were gay and
then later on we found that you were
wearing makeup for me that was like a
big shocker to me and I can't really
tell you exactly when I was okay with it
because I really I really don't know
yeah I don't either
I can't pinpoint a day or a year where I
like I'm cool with it that I am
obviously I feel like it was just time
yeah it really helped you know oh yeah
I'm definitely in general you know the
more I grew on social media the more
I got to show my family that I was able
to take care of myself in you know show
them my stories that people sending me
emails and DMS and people saying how my
story or who I was was helping them in a
way you know or helping other young men
who want to wear makeup or who just
basically just want to express
themselves or other young women who want
to express themselves I would show them
like oh my God look at this like message
I just got from this person that loves
me and doesn't really even know who I am
I feel like you and Mom were both able
to see that I was okay and that I wasn't
you know just doing this off of fluke
and that I wasn't I wasn't gonna be a
failure yeah but to be honest I don't
think it was ever had anything to do
with like a career choice or us just
knowing that you were gonna be okay I
think you kind of touched on it a little
bit is that we saw that you were happy I
think that was the biggest thing for us
is that you you came out of that funk
that you were in and you started
becoming your old self again and that's
where I think that turning point was for
all of us was that we started to see the
Manny that we all knew and loved going
back on what you said in regards to
people contacting you and sharing their
stories with you and how you've affected
their lives I'm thankful for that I'm
actually thankful for all your followers
I guess you made it possible for him to
get through those tough times I wasn't
there I should have been but but I
wasn't I love all your followers
everybody that's been there to support
you I give you a big thanks you were
there at a time when he needed you the
most you were there at a time where I
should have been there but I wasn't
you've helped him realize his dream
especially with all the the growth that
he's had in the last what two three four
years when he started working at Sephora
and Mac fast forty to two today
this is last Saturday you had your first
launch for this with this palette right
here this bucket right here yeah and to
be honest I'd like to share my take on
this because I know he's given you the
reasoning behind that and and it's it's
a beautiful story
this means so much more to me than you
know when I see this I see him literally
fighting and struggling and working so
hard to achieve his goals even though he
didn't have the support of its his
father or his family at that time he did
art often drag and
there's people out there that don't
believe I don't really give a shit what
you say I know the truth and there's
other shit out there that I know the
truth but I'm not gonna say anything now
I will say I will say it later I swear
to you I will when he came up with that
idea I was probably the proudest I have
ever been of him when I did come out
when it when we first complete it when
we received it for the first time we
actually held it in our hands I was a
proud papa
and I know the struggles behind this I'm
a part of lunar Beauty I'm gonna make
sure that as a company that we we do
give back to the community I'm gonna
make it a mission of my life that I will
be there for the LGBTQ youth that needs
help and guidance I thank you all
there's really not much I can say I'm
gonna ask I'm gonna ask my son to help
me create I guess my social media
platforms so I could bring awareness to
the cause great organizations out there
that are are there to help and I want to
make sure that I give everything that I
possibly can to help them out you just
need to have somebody tell them that
they're loved maybe I'll even do videos
like this in the near future they
probably won't be this fancy edited I
apologize BP on my damn computer but I
want to share my views maybe do Q&amp;amp;A with
parents that are struggling out there
oh well I will help you of course create
an Instagram and a Twitter and do all
that I would like of course you know I
just wanted to sit here and just chat
with you guys you know again like I said
earlier it's Pride Month and I just
wanted to you know talk about my journey
with my dad and my with my family and
how it hasn't always been easy for me
and I know a lot of people see my life
and think that like oh his life is not
perfect it's outlandish he's a beauty
guru he has millions of followers it's
so easy for him all the time but it's
not and I just want you guys to know
that I've struggled so much in the past
I've struggled for so long and so hard I
really had to dig within myself to
really keep going and really keep
pushing and I've been so lucky to have
the platform that I have you know to
talk about these kind of things and for
you guys to be able to reach out to me
or give you guys resources you know I'm
gonna link some links down below of
different organizations for you guys
need some help I suppose they think you
did my dad for coming down here and
being so candid and being so honest and
just you know confronting his past with
how it was for the LGBT community with
him
and how was for us you know growing up
and things like that it was hard but we
got through it and now we work together
literally every single day
it's so cool and so crazy to see such a
transformation and it's I'm so lucky to
have the parents that I have we're so
loving if you guys have parents who are
going through something similar you know
