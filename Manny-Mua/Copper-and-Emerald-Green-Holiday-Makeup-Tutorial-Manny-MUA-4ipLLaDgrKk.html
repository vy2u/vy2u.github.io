Thanksgiving I love Thanksgiving so much
and I think it's cuz I'm a big girl and
I just love food you know I just really
do it it was funny it's like I've been
getting and I think it's cuz the new
lighting shows colors very very true
I've been getting a lot of comments
about like the blue like the darkness
here from my beard area because I do
shave and then I'll put makeup on it and
you can still see a blue cast that's
totally fine with me I'm totally okay
with that as you guys know I'm not
trying to like make it look like I am a
girl or I'm not trying to cover up the
fact that I'm a man that I don't care I
won't shave my face I'll give you their
cuz I want it there you know what I mean
it's not like I am filming trying to be
a female you know me that's totally not
what it is I'm filming just for fun and
that's why I don't mind having a blue
cast on my face because I'm a man and
I'm not trying to like cancel it I'm not
doing drag I'm just doing fun makeup I
just use a tart shape tape concealer I'm
gonna push that in hello coverage my
name is Manny mu hain welcome back to my
channel
okay cool so now we're going to set the
under eyes with the same Beauty Blender
and my little RC ma no color powder I
will I do it I was like press the bottle
but the powder goes up to the top and
I'll just like dunk my Beauty Blender
it's not the most sanitary but it's only
mine so I don't really like care that
much
Leona I don't and I'll set my under eye
with the RC ma no clear powder which
I've been using so much recently like
all I've been using underneath my eyes
actually I mean if you're using a lot of
it it works great like if I were to like
a small like spritz of it I'd be like
 and you like change it up but since
I'm doing like a lot of my cooking with
it it works out really really nicely for
me mommy creases okay mommy creases
in this one audience mm oh me oh
say I'm a coke whore okay we're gonna
work with that but yeah so my parents
are coming up - celery - birthday riddle
Universal Studios tomorrow and to me so
much fun I can't wait I haven't seen my
mom and my dad in a minute well my dad
yes I have seen him because he kind of
helps me around with work but my mom she
has a little job in San Diego and a
buckin Haney I mean I love it I'm so
happy for her because she got her RN and
it's amazing that she has a job I'm so
proud of her but I miss her so much and
I just wish I she moved to LA already so
I can see you every day I am a mother's
boy like you guys popping this already
your pie like panty we know you're
buggin greatly but I'm such a mama's boy
like I don't like being like not with
her that makes any sense
so more he just came out with a new
gunmetal collection it's completely gold
that is massive look at my jeans
it's so big I'm gonna be using the y7
I'm assuming Y for yellow gold I'm just
gonna dip it into my studio fix powder
by Mac and put this down my neck
whenever I'm putting powders Dominic
always like to use really really dense
brushes because that picks up the color
and picks up the powder and actually
deposits a good amount of coverage
rather than like a little big amount of
covering it's like no bitch ain't color
any coverage whatever he left on the
brush we're gonna put over my cheeks
because I want to this is a nice
brush oh my gosh is it super super dense
but so soft y7o Katy I see you
bitch I'm jinyu's like I have like the
whole entire I literally I'm literally
unboxing them right now and I'm boxing
the bottom light using them right now I
mean I just use them off I get y11 god
this is like mmm that's why I was like I
wonder why I like these so much they're
the elite bristles I was like why am i
living for this so much were they so
soft elite bristles you guys know the
elite collection by morphe is my
favorite collection they've ever done
they're so good
it's so bad how good they are okay Marc
Jacobs insta mark same brush or - no
highlight the under part of our eyes
okay guys so since the holiday season is
coming up what is your favorite thing
about the holiday season like what's
your favorite thing do you guys love
like the food that's around you guys
love like the camaraderie do you love
like the decorations you love the
atmosphere do you love it all like what
is your favorite thing about the
holidays
I'm just curious I mean like we're doing
this like you're ready you might as well

talk you know I would say - definitely
love during the holiday season you know
and it's like I know that the holiday
season is also extremely stressful and
it's also a lot of time for like hatred
and like just a lot of negativity
because that's just how it is sometimes
you know the holidays bring out the best
and they're bring out the worst in
people but I would say my favorite
favorite part is the amount of love and
just the atmosphere of holiday season
it's such a caring like giving some time
and I just love that so so so so much I
just love that it's like it makes me
like geeky the one thing I'll say about
holiday season though that makes me kind
of like sad or depressed is that like I
don't have like a boyfriend or
significant other does that make sense
like I feel like during the holiday
season is when I notice it more y59 like
my everyday life I don't notice it like
I don't really care that I don't have a
boyfriend I don't have a man or whatever
there's something about the holiday
season that makes me like realize that
I'm not with someone does that make any
sense like there's nothing like the
holiday season to remind me that I'm
 single once bitten and twice shy
it's so funny / sad like how every year
I'll be like this year's the year I'm
gonna have a boyfriend this year's of
the year I'm gonna like have someone in
my life that I care about and that like
by present for something I don't know
like I cannot be the only one thinking
that I cannot be the only one thinking
like during the holiday seasons is when
I'm always like I'm not saying I'm not
happy single I'm very happy being single
I love it I'm very independent I don't
like when people are needy towards me
and there's like a lot of things I don't
like about that aspect of being with
someone but there's something about it
at the same time that makes me like sad
I'm like hmm I think I'd be really cool
boyfriend you know I think I'd have a
lot I think I have a lot to offer
someone so maybe one day during the
Christmas time I'll have a boyfriend
we'll see honestly raise of hands show
of hands who here would die if I had a
boyfriend die we would die like I think
we would all just die but I'm
also extremely picky so there's that uh
there's a lot doesn't criteria for me to
even consider like wanting to date
someone smart driven kind close with
their family hopefully cuz I'm close
with mine and I can't really imagine
like dating someone that wasn't close to
their own that'd be really really really
weird I'm gonna be taking for the
tutorial part today today's look how to
be taking the Nubian at to palette and
it just looks so nice and I got in the
mail and I swatch a couple colors and I
was like don't even taking the shade
Zuri and I'm gonna highlight with that
one because it looks really nice and
it's really really pigmented and really
bright so we'll see oh that's so pretty
oh okay come on Zuri it's actually quite
blinding
in person holy out of the lighting
can pick it up but but yeah but okay so
I went ahead night to my brows and
contoured my nose a little bit off of
camera just slightly just to pitch it
down a little bit little rhinoplasty up
in this horror a my eyes are pined by
the way so we're gonna do an eye look
now
so a lot of you I have a poll going up
onto it right now it has like thousands
and thousands of votes on it and it
literally is tied between warm copper
and emerald green so I'm going to just
incorporate both the warm copper and the
emerald green I think I'm gonna do a
warm copper I look on the top and then
like emerald green lower lashline just
incorporate both for you guys because
you guys did vote and you guys were
definitely part of it but both of them
are literally at the exact same rate of
winning so I'm gonna go ahead and do
both of them within Julius place Nubian
helot both these are gonna be
incorporated in today's look because
they just look so snatched so this
palette doesn't really have release soft
transition so I'm gonna go in with a
nubian one palette and use one of these
colors I was like my little transition
shade I'm gonna take this guy right
there looks like a little bit of that
and put it on a morphe why 16 which
reminds me 27 very similar we're going
to put this into the crease and this is
just going to help warm up the crease
and have a transition for us to go down
with first so we can blend the other
colors into this color okay so I'm
thinking about taking this shade at
Morocco it's a really nice bright like
orange rusty orange on AM or PM 4 3 3 so
I'm gonna do that on the eyes as well
actually get that putting like a really
warm orange shade into the crease makes
everything just pop and look so pretty
and so complimentary and so just since I
have greener eyes and I just like to use
oranges and my everyday look because it
just complements my eyes very well and a
lot of you guys are always like why
using so much oranges but it's just like
it works great with my eye color so I'm
gonna keep incorporating oranges and
then using different colors to like the
accent colors so that's kind of why I'm
taking this Morocco shade I'm gonna put
that on to the crease a little bit lower
and a little bit less heavy-handed but
I'm concentrating on the outer corner a
little bit lower than I have that first
original shade okay that's so gorgeous
Jesus I'm gonna all the way to the inner
corner this is why having a transition
shade down for us really really really
help because it's so much easier to
blend out this bright Morocco shade
which is going to be a little bit harder
to blend out originally I just think
that transition shades to me are really
really important
that's why I love using them how it
looks blended on camera because in
person it blended to bill so now
for the star of the lid I'm taking the
shade yaa which is like yeah I think
it's just yeah yeah I'll just take that
on my finger it's it you guys it is so
crazy pigmented this palette it's like
shocking look like it's crazy
I'm like oh my god what the hell and
it's like not expensive either which is
why it's like a trip to me okay whatever
time I take that shade yeah on my finger
I'm gonna put it on the lid like you
know I'm gonna
oh that's deadly that is deadly that
shade is so pretty holy crap like a fire
bird shot on my face I'm gonna go ahead
and take that in for three three one
more time and blend out those edges so
there's no harsh lines in between and
just be careful with fallout because
these really pigmented intense shades
that are kind of foiled tend to have a
little bit of fallout you know you feel
me so just be careful with that okay
great so now we have the top of the lash
line done um let's do the bottom lash
line now now I go ahead and dipped into
the shade Egypt which is this shade
right here it's a really pretty emerald
green and I put that all over the lower
lash line on this little morphe y-20
brush any pencil brush will do I'm just
gonna go and smoke out my lower lash
line with this maybe I'm gonna choke it
out like shelise black okay we're gonna
hold them I'm going to take the monster
liner by artist Anton my favorite
eyeliners of all time it's so good so
freaking good and we run on the lower
lash line and a little bit on the actual
lashes because I'm going to be smoking
it out down here it's very creamy which
is why I like it so much screaming black
it doesn't move all the way to the tear
duct I'm not gonna take it all the way
in like all the way all the way in my
eyes get watery but I'm gonna take it
pretty far I'm really really piling it
on that lower lash line like really
piling it on I'm just taking a 36 brush
by morphia course and I'm gonna go ahead
and blend this out before it starts to
dry because having a black base down
first will make it look so awesome the
green and will really pop and stand out
and now we're gonna pile on the green
with this y20 brush oh I'm gonna blend a
little bit lower
okay guys so I went ahead I did my
eyeliner off of Cameron because it was
taking me so long to do eyeliner just it
just does
I just dad that's what happens I wanted
to show you guys really quickly that I'm
going to be highlighting the inner
corner and my brow bone with the shade
Zuri
which is the highlight shade I use on
chip I'm gonna take a little bit on a
morpheme three to six amazing inner
corner brushes my favorite of all time
I'm just gonna pile it on whoo do not be
stingy yes go broad boned
mmm that's so beautiful bugs Yuri you're
like giving me lying
we got me taking the a benefit roller
lash mascara my favorite mascara
basically of all time I use this all the
time I'm like almost out of this tube
 I'm gonna go ahead and put on some
mascara to prep for the false lashes I'm
gonna be putting on because you guys
already know I wasn't gonna do anything
with no false lashes okay great so I
went in for some lashes on off of camera
I'm wearing the new bound some Bella
lashes as always you guys know this is
like my go-to lash all the time like
this is my go-to lash I cannot like not
wear this fair especially when I'm doing
a dramatic look like this like I feel
like this kind of look
calls for dramatic eyelashes like
whispies just like slang these
whores you know so I'm gonna go ahead
and do the lip nail and I'm thinking I
want to do something kind of
cost-effective so we're gonna take NYX
peekaboo neutral lip liner one of my
go-to in the past I'm going to go ahead
and line her entire lip that's a little
high for me oh my god even for me
not too bad I'm gonna fill in about half
the lip like so and I'm gonna go in with
another affordable product on me going
in with the new maybelline nude thrill
lipstick this is their loaded bold
collection which is like a really
pigmented I believe their matte
collection like a matte satin let's go
try it I haven't tried any B's yet I
don't write any of them but nude Thrilla
just sounded like right up my
alley oh that's really pretty I reminds
me a myth
ahhh oh my god this is like a myth dupe
whoa that is light tell me this does not
look like Mac myth I feel so good I love
Maybelline lives in so much and this is
the final look
