today's video is going to be my December
2015
favorites video I am like so shocked and
so like amazed that thousand fifteen is
over I feel like a flew by so fast as
you get older the years go by so
fast and it's kind of scary and makes
you appreciate the years going by so
much more because you're like oh my god
getting older like you wanna spend as
much time with your family as possible
and your loved ones and things like that
so tangent tangent mode sorry
about that but as always if you guys
like this video if you guys don't like
me please don't watch it you
know that you would thing but if you
guys do like this video and you guys do
let me please like this video and
subscribe to my channel if you are not
ready and if you knew what is up happy
2016 so let's get into this December
favorites video okay cool let's start
this well with some
skincare items I'm so excited last month
I did really have any skincare items I
don't think I did but this month I have
to yeah so it's going shop with the face
wash for herself this entire month all
I've been using is the Korres Greek
yoghurt foaming cream cleanser this is
from Korres if you have to been watching
me for a while you guys know that the
Greek yoghurt mask and the Greek yoghurt
moisturizer are one of my favorite
products from CREZ I use them literally
religiously all the time I love the
Korres Greek yoghurt line so when I got
this this is the foaming cleanser I was
like let me just try this out so I tried
it and I've been loving it this whole
entire month I tried it in the beginning
and I've used it every single day twice
a day since and what I like about this
so much is that it foams up and it
cleans my face really really really
nicely and deeply and intensely that's
just nice it doesn't make me feel dry
whatsoever and it's funny cuz like I
feel like I have the skin that's the
best of both worlds for viewers like I
have oily skin so I like to use products
that are gonna continue my oil but I
like to feel really really hydrated so
that's good for my like drier if you
were just you know to me when I'm using
skin crack to pretend that my skin is
dry even though it's so not so this does
not make my skin feel dry it feels very
moisturized very nourished
I think Korres the Greek yogurt plain is
absolutely amazing if you haven't tried
any of the Greek yogurt stuff from
Korres try it how even if you're oily
oily try it out if you're dry try it out
just try it out it's bomb next
skin care item is going to be the dr.
Brandt pore dermabrasion exfoliator it
looks like this is it's in this little
thick blue tube you guys this is the
best exfoliator I've ever you
tried in my life and that's saying a lot
now say I'll do
I like this one so much just because i
have problematic pores pores pores me we
battle all the time we go back
and forth they win most of the time but
i try too bad other acids what
you do is you wash your face and once
your face is still damp you put a little
tiny like pea-sized drop and you start
like exfoliating into the skin for about
a minute
you're just continuously rubbing into
your skin for about a minute and then
you stop and then you like for a minute
you like rest and you don't have
anything and you let the exfoliator like
do its magic basically it's when you
wash it off and your skin feels
amazing not only that I walk out of the
shower and I look to my skin in the
mirror my pores look smaller
no exfoliator has ever made my pores
literally looked like so much smaller as
this one did if you guys have
problematic pores go to Sephora get a
sample of this I'm all about getting
samples at Sephora let's don't get me
wrong especially with same care cuz you
just never know so my suggestion to you
guys in case I want to commit and buy it
go to Sephora get a sample of this and
try it out I'm not kidding like you will
not regret it has a little bit of mint
in it I believe so if you're allergic to
mint try and don't get don't try this
honestly like I truly did see a huge
difference in my skin and I noticed that
my skin is so much happier with me like
when it comes to the pores the pores
look away smaller the day of when I
exfoliate and I love that next day comes
in top a couple brushes really really
quickly every month brush you guys know
my favorite rest of the month so this
month more feet launched their new elite
collection brushes which have a couple
of them right here these are the three
that I said that I was gonna love and I
love them oh wait I'm missing one I
 whatever so these are three of
them that I've been loving this month so
so so much honestly like today this is
the more 5041 I've used this and a
couple tutorials already I think it's
amazing it reminds me a lot of the g.0
if you have the morphe g.0 don't buy
this one it's just another big powder
brush but since i have both of them I
just like them both if I were to choose
between the G 0 and this one I would
actually choose this one because I think
it's so amazing and the reason why is
because the elite bristles I just feel
are just so high-quality and I feel like
the brushes are just so like they're
heavy and the sturdy you can
beat a bitch's ass with this ok and I
just really really like it so I would
definitely check out the thingy 41 if
you don't have the G 0 and if you like
big powdery brushes which I ain't
 Zoo love for underneath the eye
the e 48 I have been loving it's a small
little baby tulip brush so cute it kinda
reminds me the morphe M 4 through 8
which is my go-to but this one I just
feel again hi
quality bristles and then it picks up
probably really nicely because it's very
very dense but it definitely packs on a
good amount of product you know
I love this brush this little tulip
setting brush obsessed and last but not
least this is the e 53 brush which is a
very tapered blush brush I think is it
that's what I use it for I uses for
blush I think it's such an awesome like
a different brush I don't have any
brushes like this and I think that's why
I love the elite brushes by morphe - I
don't have any brushes like them from
any brand you know what I mean and I
feel like if you're a professional
makeup artist or if you're really your
makeup enthusiast you will love these
brushes like so much because they're so
different and so like multi-purposed
which I love you can use this to contour
with your uses to highlight with blush
anything
fuck-you e53 you badass bitch
love and of course I have the coated
Murphy mani Mui all-caps online in-store
boom I mean you get to save 10% if you
guys want to use it you guys can if you
guys don't it's all good I'm gonna fill
deal with them I always like to just
killing that with you guys you guys know
what I do but I really do appreciate it
when you guys use my codes honestly I
get so many tweets of you guys saying
that you went to morphe use my code and
you got things and so thank you guys
thank you guys so much like I really
appreciate that so I want to talk about
this really quickly because I'm using it
like a madman this is the Urban
Decay Naked skin
ultra definition loose powder this
 powder I'm wearing on my face
right now this powder is so beautiful
it's a very very very lightweight silky
HD powder so this powder I don't know if
you guys can tell from here how the
powder looks it is very very finely
milled I've never seen a loose powder
this fine I'm not kidding like this is
one of the finest powders feels like
soap it's absolutely beautiful I use it
to set my face if I'm using this like on
an event or something what I like to do
is I set my face with a translucent
powder and then I'll go over it with
this HD powder and it looks full Ollis I
don't know how it look excuse me how I
never really heard about this but
Patchett was one that really got me to
try this one and he said he loved eggs
that his pores look smaller his face
with a lot more smooth with this powder
so I'm like okay let me try it out I did
it he's totally right it is literally an
HD powder looks beautiful on the skin I
am obsessed naked urban decay I'd die
for you naked skin urban decay ultra
definition loose finishing powder
I talked so fast Wow calm down
so the concealer for the month that I
have been loving is the Make Up For Ever
Ultra HD concealer I think it's
absolutely amazing I think they
reformulated the packaging as well as
the formula
the last HD formula it is full coverage
the formula is lightweight it's dense
but it's lightweight same time I don't
know that makes sense but it doesn't
creeps on me easily it doesn't crease um
easily which is the biggest reason why I
love it so much it does not crease
intensely on me and I'm like all
concealers do often see this crease like
a madman
um if I don't set it within like five
seconds but this one didn't so I was
like this is really really cool
make it forever really killed it with a
concealer Ultra HD again a fork a bitch
so one more under-eye product that I
really want to talk about is the benefit
shy beam I use this first when I first
use this in the tutorial I forgot what's
tutorial used it in but that was a first
time I had ever tried it and I have been
obsessed ever since it is such a
beautiful highlighter oh my god this it
looks like this is the full-size one
check it out like a little brush tip
it's a little brush and you literally
just kind of brush it on you see it's a
little brush so this is what it looks
like
you get to see how brightening that is
it is such a brightening under-eye
highlighter this is what I use it for i
think it's marketed as a matte
highlighter which i mean you can use at
the top of cheekbones but i used to
underneath my eyes and i notice a huge
difference of how bright and awake my
eyes looked when I use this due to the
fact that it did have that peachy
undertone which I love I love that peach
enos so what I like to do is I'll
combinedly make a forever HD with the
shy beam and I think it looks so freakin
bright and intense I'm wearing
underneath my eyes right now and I feel
like my under eyes look so intense so
bright and even I don't even put like
any banana powder or anything it's just
that that's how bright and intense it is
and so you can see right here it's
drying down to a matte finish and it's
so freaking brightening like I love it
benefit really really kills it with this
one and you guys just try it
wow you guys really should yeah if you
guys have the Porefessional kit that
benefit did during the holidays the shy
beam is inside professional kit so grab
it and try it out before you go up by
the full size but I'm just saying if you
guys got the kit you guys got lucky
because you guys gonna see before it
came out but and the packaging benefit
kills packaging just always benefits
just adorable okay then
kill of yet blush of the month okay
this blush has been my saving grace for
this month it is the japonesque blush in
OH - this is the Velvet Touch blush it's
what it looks like I'm wearing it on my
face today it is the perfect blending
blush between the contour and a
highlighter that is what I use it for it
is seriously beautiful it's so basic and
pan
like no tea no shade but it looks kind
of basic in the pan I'm like you know
why is this even good but I got
a huge package from japonesque one day
and I saw this blush and I was like hmm
it's like swatched on my finger wasn't
too impressed I was like you know it's
nice it's a whenever it's hella whatever
but then I tried it on my face and I was
like oh my god
stop you know like I was shocked at how
much I liked it it gives me a beautiful
like peachy pink glow it's not matte but
it's not like shiny whatsoever and very
soft Sheen to the skin and I think it
looks beautiful as a blush I think
japonesque I sold that Ulta
it's like bolts is like high-end brand
there um but I think that powder is
absolutely amazing and like packaging
adore bolt like a very sturdy I really
like it number Oh - you guys killed it
with this one plastic products of the
month last December favorites on my lips
right now I am wearing the over a long
red liquid lipstick in Bel Air Bel Air
liquid lipstick by Ofra has been my
go-to lipstick for this month the entire
month I've been wearing it not stop
where am i mean greet earlier this month
I wore it in the video already I'm
wearing it right now I cannot stop
wearing bel-air oh describe this as a
very peachy nude color and I don't do
peach colors I do not wear peach
lipsticks you guys so this is a big deal
for me to like one that looks like
pretty decent on me I think it looks
really really pretty
ask Patrick he knows I don't like
wearing peach on the lips and you know
it's not my thing but I said when I put
this one I was like so shocked at how
much I loved it and I literally have not
put it down since I think bel-air is
sick um I'm also an affiliate with Oprah
they gave me a coat I think it's Manny
in all caps and you get to take 30% off
their website I'll leave the link down
below if you're interested but I think
their lipstick formula is so nice it's
beautiful
Kathleen has done some lipsticks with
them Miami fever and Havana nights and
they've came out stunning
stunning ass lipsticks and so yeah I
think you guys should definitely just
try out an O for lipstick just try one
see what you think of it and then just
keep kind of trying it from there
because I love them I really truly do
and I even have any Oh for a little
lipstick swatch video up on my channel

the month is uh Nastasia Beverly Hills
gloss in butterscotch you guys this
gloss anytime I've been wearing gloss

while and I just keep forgetting to talk
about it but it is seriously such a
beautiful nude color it is very very
you can see that it's like nudists howl

colors I think new colors on the lips
are gorgeous so I've been wearing this
non-stop whenever I go out and I need
some gloss on I'll toss on this one this
is the only gloss I've been wearing like
