channel
hey guys welcome back to my channel it's
Manny here what is up as you can see
from the title of today's video today's
video is going to be a Halloween
tutorial on how to create a Jeffrey star
look this is the look I came up with
this is my Geoffrey start inspired
Halloween tutorial I haven't had any
time to create any Halloween videos so
this is kind of my way of just kind of
doing something Halloweeny because I'm
going out of town and I'm going to
London this month and when New York and
Wayne San Francisco and it's been so
intense for me and I have not been able
to film anything for Halloween so I
wanted to do something that was easy and
fun and really just simple to do and
this is just a fun look and Jeffrey's
honestly one of my best friends ever and
this is why I did a video inspired by
him this is basically is entire this is
his look like this is wig is it
his coat this is necklace his little dig
oh yeah I just thought to be so much fun
to create this look he's one of my best
friends here and he's done so much for
me and I love him so much
come on nails oh my god and pink nails
yeah gonna face yeah this is not fun
this is not fun I'm like this this I
like that I don't like it yeah anyways
thank you guys so much for watching this
video as always if you guys want this
video if you guys are like me please
don't watch it you know the
drill with that I don't do this cuz
Jeffrey always does this dislike if you
guys do like this video please give it a
thumbs up and subscribe to my channel if
you aren't already and if you knew
what's up a man um you a what go to my
channel well today I'm Jeff we start but
usually I'm an emu Wayne usually have a
penis you better come through jeffree
star inspired look let's get into the
video
okay guys let's go and start this video
as you can see I have no brows on
whatsoever I already blocked them out
off camera because Jeffrey doesn't have
brows but I didn't want to show you guys
doing it because I actually don't know
what I'm doing so the first time I've
ever tried doing it and it kind of looks
like so we're gonna just continue
on with this
there's tons of tutorials on how to
block out your brows on YouTube so
that's just what it is and I just didn't
want to block them out on camera because
I don't know what the I'm doing
okay it feels so weird to like have no
facial hair at all on it's like really
odd to me I'm probably Porefessional by
the way I'm just so used to having some
at least some facial hair I'm nothing
and also I'm wearing a cap because I'm
gonna be wearing a wig at the end so
it's like a good tell for me where did
uh have the rest of my makeup and where
to not have it you know Jeffery loves
primers use a primer phonetic so we have
to prime obviously and if you guys think
like Manny why to keep looking to the
right or like this way my step is
different as you can see hi and you set
up by the way my viewfinder now is over
here and it's just like different I
guess I don't know I don't know okay
cool so since I have facial hair and so
I have like this like darkness around my
face I'm gonna put a little bit of
corrector on my beard area like just
like right here just like the NYX
correct Rick I don't have any of my own
here I've got this at the frigging
drugstore yesterday when I was looking
for nails like press-on nails hmm I'm
seeing some corrector on my beard area
because I am much hairier than Jeffrey
Jeffrey has laser on his face and I
don't so it's gonna use on areas that
have like a lot more darkness so like
right here on my chin a little bit so I
was like thinking oh my god I'm gonna go
on with my normal make it forever HD I
had no idea I'm like out of it that's
the end
Zoho I don't have any combination of
options there is full coverage so we're
just gonna really really make this work
we use a brush for optimum coverage
because there's like nothing in the air
we're gonna literally whirl or brush
into this I need to go to like Sephora
ASAP and get some freaking more stuff I
don't have like Laura Mercier powder I'm
out of like a lot of oh by the way
before you go on with the rest of the
face and before you go over your
corrector put on a little bit of
translucent powder or any powder to set
that cream or else it's going to move a
little bit when you put on the next
foundation step for that to say that now
go in with the foundation
make your neck look like a bullfrog
you're going down your neck
why is my breast of a weird oh
my god it smells like like shrimp or
something what the and while you
want the cream first and then I'll go
over with a liquid foundation just
because it's a lot easier to build up
coverage from a cream to a liquid and
that's what we're doing in Jeffery loves
full coverage so um he's a girl after my
own heart
instead of life so for those of the face
you're a flash foundation was gonna
spray it on oh me don't be stingy
this is one of Jeffrey's of my favorite
foundations it's so amazing and it
really gives you like a doll like
airbrush finish Hey look like haha
okay I just Pat it in again with that
e-cigs from morphe - I forget the ears
and now we're looking for oh my god it
looks like I had no brows what I was
thinking to myself is like Manny why you
look so weird and I'm like oh
there's no problem mMmmm I can demote
can't emot-- okay so we need some
concealers now I'm gonna go in with the
Tarte shake tape concealer Jeffery loves
this one and so do you
I'm gonna be taking this shades light
and fair I'm gonna go and highlight the
face with this as well as concealer nila
Hines I look so full covered right now
it's kind of a joke and we're gonna make
sure our nose looks pretty cute and
adorable cuz jumping is the cutest
little nose and I don't so we're gonna
contour I'm gonna snatch in the nose a
little bit so that's in the shade light
and now I'm going with a shade fair
which is Jeffrey shade I'm going to do a
little bit more on the center of the
face business faces little bit more
gaunt than mine and by that I mean it's
a little bit more like my face is fatter
it's basically I'm trying so we're gonna
go ahead and make it look smaller and
more center to the face and that's what
a light can see that would do it will
make everything look more centered and
bright in the middle and darker on the
outer corner so that's kinda what we're
doing and blend that bitch out
so now I'm gonna take a little sponge
this is the Real Techniques Beauty
Blender and we're going blend that
concealer in to the skin and make sure
it's concentrated more so on the t-zone
to make a look like our face is slightly
smaller basically like think of this as
like kind of doing drag and I know
Jeffrey's not a drag queen or anything
but I am kind of trying to change much
of the shape of my face slightly to make
it a little bit more like his you know
Garcia made no color powder and put that
underneath my eyes to cook Donal besides
my nose as well
make
look a little smaller than 15 good minds
kind of Bing okay and then for the rest
of the face I'm gonna go and just take a
big powder puff and set it with that
same no color powder my just hate the
 applicator of this it's so
annoying I'd like for it in here on the
pub and fold the fold the puff put the
powder in there and like that I learned
this from Wayne Goss he does this to
make all the powder go into the pot
kinda okay just go in
so really pressing this on so we don't
remove any of the foundation the cream
that's really important obviously you
want to keep everything there on a scale
from one to ten how terrible do I look
with no brows for real this is
deadly and twenty cuz I feel like
there's not many people that can pull
off no brows Jeffries one of them they
can and Lady Gaga can other than them
there's literally no one that can pull
it off I feel I mean maybe there is but
they just blow really well and I haven't
seen other people pull it off as well we
are set to fill oh also Jeffrey really
really really really loves Studio Fix by
Max working into a little light layer of
that on top and I might as well just do
it because we need more coverage and we
don't need it but it's just nice to have
extra coverage you know especially over
the beard area then most of the time you
guys are not gonna be men so you don't
only have to worry about as much but me
Mama's not trying to have a lot of blue
showing through you know she's darker
than my placement and c25 is a
little dark on me and you know I was
light blue yeah I wish i Jefferies chin
hmm-hmm go away go away so I probably
looks so crazy right now but
it's all good because there's a part of
that in there
maybe part even do it okay so now we're
going to start contouring I'm gonna go
ahead and take my Kevin a Kwan medium
sculpting powder it's like a cool tone
sculpting powder almost dropped and I
don't also got this little bulky brush
come on there we go get out of that hole
and then I'm gonna grab the morphe r10
brush it's like a life-size little
tapered brush and I'm gonna kind of
contour my face like Jeffries is it's a
little bit like I said earlier it's a
little more gaunt than mine so I'm going
to go ahead and go in here I'm gonna go
ahead and start the back of the hairline
start going in blending upwards to blend
and I'm going to kind of take the
contour also down here slightly just to
give me a little more of a chiseled
look doing this little extra step will
help make it look like you have a little
bit more of a skinny defined face so
that's kind of what I'm going for to do
that I'll just adds a little more of a
shadow and it kind of gives me more of
an appearance of a higher cheekbones
that's kind of what I'm going for
cuz Jeffrey cheekbones are snatched to
the goddess's right there all right
there okay go ahead and come to our need
your chin is less meat around his look
and Jim like mine and go ahead and do
the jawline Jeffrey has a nice printouts
jawline and this is gonna help give us a
more soft dainty appearance of a job
right there hi feminine jaw my name is
Manny nice to meet you basically do this
to see what extra area you need to cover
what extra areas are Darney to cover
right there I know it's good
haha okay cool not even a softer jaw
I'm gonna take my trusty Marc Jacobs
Mirage filtrating powder the light one
and I'm gonna go ahead put that
underneath my eyes to help just brighten
up everything again make sure everything
is concentrated and centered here it
gives you a nice outline to base of
where I want to go with the look like I
said earlier Jeffrey's cheekbones are
much more pronounced than mine are so
I'm gonna take that lighter powder a
little bit lower to make it look like I
have a little bit more of a contrast
compared to the contour right there give
me more of a poppy cheek look it's not
much different than what I do but still
I'm go swing it okay so now I'm gonna go
and contour my nose is an important step
because Jeffrey has a small cute little
der balloon so I'm gonna take the same
powder and this little tiny eye brush by
morphe don't know what it does it
doesn't even say I'll leave a link down
below I wanna do is go and start at the
top of the nose going down the bridge of
the nose and I'm gonna take it a little
bit farther in like than I normally do
only to make sure we have a nice small
nose appearance took some underneath
your nose right here give you more of a
lifted little cute like button nose
bring it right into my socket line slash
my brow line right up here Jeffrey
always does is he always combined his
like nose contour with his socket line
shadow I'm gonna do that as well a
little bit underneath my lip because he
has some libs on that
 so let's go ahead just try
to make it look like we have some work
to do underneath getting this a little
bit of shadow and I go this it a little
bit bigger I'm gonna take a little of
the darker shadow again on the sides of
my nose to make it look like a little
bit smaller bring it kind of in right
there
see I just kinda made my nose look a
little bit smaller right there because I
had to shadow kind of recedes everything
and there we go my nose looks
lately smaller I mean I'm not I'm not a
 surgeon kinda miracle work here
we're gonna cook the sides of the nose
really quickly not intensely just that
part just to make it look like a sharper
cleaner line see uh see
mm-hmm also cook a little bit underneath
in the contour my face is looking pretty
skinnier already honestly truly honestly
everything's cooking this going just do
some blush and some highlight you know
Geoffrey's a highlighting Queen and I
know he is so I'm gonna go ahead and
take the Solstice palette by sleek we
both love it and he loves to be blinding
his more feet in five ten Hey and
that little beautiful one right there
dip into it I'm gonna him Colin for
looking emotions he actually love to do
even like down to his leg right
there he she takes that
 down yeah yeah that's just
right there smiling this binding yep
right there
he was bow as well he'd love to do cute
as well now I'm going just dust off the
cooking of the nostrils so brush away
literally just brushing on a slightly
you look sad a lot of highlight to his
nose right here like like intensely boom
okay so Jeffery in the past used to love
doing like really bold intense blushes
I'd literally don't have any bold
intense blushes with me somebody gonna
take the Becca a champagne split in the
shade flower child flower child is
already a blush from Becca but this is
the one with Jacqueline he'll like the
collaboration so I'm gonna use flower
child just give me a nice pink flush
because Jeffrey does like doing a nice
flush toned
pinky look sometimes so I'm gonna take
that am rv4 without all the cheeks and
it's okay if it looks kind of intense
cuz Jeffrey does use a contour with
blush so I'm like bitch yeah okay cool
so now I'm gonna go and focus on the
brows now Jeffrey doesn't have my brows
that's why I blocked him out originally
and he draws on his brows this is
actually what I was the most terrified
to do I did not I don't know what I'm
doing I've never done this before I've
never drawn on a brow before I never
done drag like this I've never blocked
on my brow so that's why I look like a
 weird I'm just gonna take the NYX
micro pencil in the shade taupe and
we're gonna pray for the
I never even use this okay so we're
gonna just draw it right above my real
brow I guess we're gonna start it here I
hate doing this okay hold on we're
trying this again just glue
there that's why it's harder I was like
why am i struggling so hard to do when
you have glue
okay honestly the NYX brow pencil was
not working enough for me so I'm going
to grab it the Maybelline brow precise
and micro pencil because it's a much
creamier a little bit more pigmented so
I go and fill in the brow I basically
did the outline the top and the bottom
part and the brows part is really
really tough lightly fill it in with
that same brow pencil I get ready with
him so much you would think I would know
how to do this once I get to the front
of the brow to feather it forward
that doesn't look that bad for never
drawing it on before ever that's not bad
that's not too bad okay I'm going to
other side off the camera quick and I'll
be here right back and we are back this
is what the brows look like guys yeah
not nearly as good as Geoffrey does it's
actually really really really hard to do
this much harder than I was going to be
I was having a lot of problems with the
pencil because does it have my brows it
glued down it was like really really
picking up and I'm like you know what
like I can't avoid this it's gonna just
look like crap so I'm basically doing a
drag version I'm Geoffrey star at this
point I'm just going to put some
concealer on my eyes now then start
priming this is what I'm gonna be using
as primer I'm taking the Mac Pro
Longwear concealer as my primer for my
eyes and all the way up to the brow
humming total for the shadows maybe I
should've practiced this much before I
tried what kind of in smart I don't have
enough time clearly and again I'm doing
the bridge is nothing oh my god I had to
put contacts on after this do not forget
to write me guys so since Jeffrey wears
contacts literally all the time he let
me borrow a pair of contacts I'm gonna
take the Desio innocent white contacts
and I'm putting these in my eye you guys
I'm not a contact where her at all I
have a really tough time finding
contacts and actually so let's pray that
me using makeup more often will help me
put these contacts back in in they're
going to pop in your Desio innocent
white contacts like my hands
hmm oh my god
like a little weird like I can do this I
can so come on guys I do make it look
literally everybody I can do this can do
this can't okay whoa whoa wrinkles and
now we have the contacts in I'm gonna go
ahead and start on with the eyes now
finally finally okay Jeffrey does really
cool bold looks all the time so I'm
trying to incorporate a lot of pink and
a lot of just boldness I suppose but he
does do a lot of pink looks all the time
so that's kind of that's my main look
and my main color like scheme them and
go in I'm gonna take the UH Nastasia
modern a renaissance products is the
only thing I have at this house really
any English opening or I need to go back
home and get my it was the first
color first I'm gonna go in with a burnt
orange and I'm gonna take two on the
morphe 27 that's just gonna go into the
new crease like basically up here over
the brow can I do this my mom dude yeah
thank you that right building out this
new crease thing totally okay so I'm
gonna put this orange burnt shade over
here and create this new crease above my
real crease whoa jjz man same thing on
the side right over the brow like
basically the under part of my brows
where I'm starting the crease whoa ah
I'm the Jacqueline right now
I need to blend this okay
to start with this what the hell I'm
gonna take makeup geek beaches and cream
that's gonna go above this to have
something to blend over cuz this was to
be so much easier if I just shake it on
my brow I took one for the team there
was no way on this earth I was going to
do that but I knew crazies come on
crease Oh shucks so I'm gonna take a
love letter from honest Aussie which is
this pink shade right there on a Murphy
m43 3 and that's going to go into our
newfound crease as our pink shade we're
gonna really start to build that baggage
of and create this really pretty pink
moment uh-huh
come on Jeffrey blend in circular
motions taking it outwards that's
 cool just so differently I'm not
useless like drag --is-- light not
saying that Jeffy's drag it just like
the brows down and that's final
SiC love-letter down the bridge of the
nose a little bit like something Jeffrey
would do
could pull the pink all the way if I'll
get down blend him on your brow a whole
new form of blending this is not so it
doesn't really look blend guys I
apologize but it's kind of it's really
good for me I've never tried to bunt on
top of no brow before this is the first
time and I guess there's just a first
time for everything because let's
 on that is odd take a little
more of that Love Letter on the outer
corner as well Jeffrey's a bold man and
he inspires me to be bolder every day
that's like the best friend in me
talking not Jeffrey talking but
coming together like actually I'm most
shook okay great so I'm gonna go ahead
and take a rose quartz buys you away on
this is like a very light pink and i'ma
put on my as my shadow only cuz Jeffrey
loves to mix like different kinds of
Pink's on his lid and you can use any
light pink shadow that you have that
works that's fantastic I just don't have
one on me at this place so I'm gonna go
and just take the joy highlighter and
put this soft pink as my lid shade just
to give me a nice intense contrast with
Jeff elos good contrast okay now I'm
gonna take a little bit of that that
same love letter and mix it a little bit
with Venetian red and we run that
underneath my lower lash line a nice
pink intense look the whole way around
wait let's do it like Jeffrey does it
and now we're gonna dip in to Venetian
red and love-letter Jeffery lives for a
white waterline so that's we're gonna do
we're going to line the inside of our
eye with a white water line this is the
with a white eyeliner this is the color
pop one I was so cute little winged
Jeffrey love to do wings so in bromine
dang when you have no brows it's kind of
easy to do only it's like a lot easier
to take it where we wanted to go so I
thought was recording I wasn't so what I
ended up doing off of camera is I added
a little bit of a highlight that I have
on my lid on to the brow bone take me to
the nice little subtle pop and my subtle
I mean not subtle at all because it's
over my brows
okay cool so now I'm gonna go ahead for
some mascara on Jeffery lives lids for
roller lash come through rolling lash
come through okay so I'll put that on I
love it too wanna Susan with your
mascara ever
so so good whoo yes I'm on the bottom -
okay great so now that the mascara is on
I'm going to apply some lashes I'm gonna
take new bound some Russian and black
lashes and I put them on off-camera and
I'll be right back okay amazing so we
have the lashes on
I know Geoffrey really likes Russian
blacks by new bouncing so I figured to
put on one of his lashes that he really
likes pretty okay so now I'm gonna go in
with a lipstick but I know we're subject
to go in with I'm like obviously i'ma go
in with a Jeffrey Skyline anyone - oh my
god I found something I found a jeffree
star masochist lipstick this is perfect
this is perfect actually so see my mom's
history gave to me to give to my mom
because Jeffrey super sweet and like
gives me all the colors like double them
for my mom as well so mom I'm choosing
this really quickly and I'll get it back
to your promise so we're gonna take
masochists which is like a really pretty
intense pink and I live on the lips now
that's so Jeffrey yeah and Jeffrey
has big eyes lips would feel free to go
over the line so I know I am okay
cool so this is the makeup and it is
done I'm gonna go and put on a wig and
the outfit and just change into my
Jeffrey's our attire and I'll be right
back okay guys I toss on the wig and
this is what it looks like I completely
forgot to draw on a vanity right here I
think it's on the right side of his face
the wig is gonna cover it anyway so I
don't really think I'm gonna draw on
vanity but I'm gonna do a little pink
heart that he has like right here it's
on the right side maybe don't know where
it's at exactly I'm just gonna draw a
little heart and we're gonna complete
the look okay we're seeing these same
masochists and a little pencil brush
