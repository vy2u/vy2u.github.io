morphe prep and set setting spray which
I live for just like a little subtle

some of Jeffrey's and favorite
foundations he likes to use deer flush
and lemare the soft fluid or take the
cake and bake sponge
I live for this okay so I've had thick
the sponge for a minute huh and I get
like we just get so many things yes
don't you try and I'm my things that I

Oh Jeff you touch my skin
you never really like see it up close I
know what happened I mean I have you
looked at me but when you do someone's
makeup you like see everything it's like
it's hard to see when we're in the war
in the dark or having threesomes
it is hard it's hard to see and those
black lights only show the end but we're
gonna take a little bit of the lemare
soft fluid now and once you're just a
couple in the back of my hand oh and
since it is a little bit warmer than
your actual tone I might put more so on
the perimeter
like the hollows of your cheeks hmm
level with yes although Jeffrey doesn't
really need that all this coverage but I
love letters mountain girl yeah same how
could use tart shape tape underneath the
eyes take me down okay honest you guys
Jeffrey has no hole under eye bags it
makes me sick why should highlight so
certain areas - is white hmm as the
homegirl if you were to do my makeup not
my would you go shade darker which
is this understand wouldn't because I
use a shade light and this is amazing
what I thought blended out it looks mad
no I think it goes from fair to light
and I use light like a cool so I would
definitely have to keep it with fair oh
yeah and I actually use fair closer into
my nose so I can contour my nose a
little bit more harshly mmm I thought I
can he says oh my god couldn't or me
down the sponge is so good at keeping
the coverage there it's there like bitch
this is just a me harder okay a nun
