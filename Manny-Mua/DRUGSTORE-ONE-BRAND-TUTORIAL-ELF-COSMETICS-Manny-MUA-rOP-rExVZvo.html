so today's video as you can see from the
title is going to be a one brand
tutorial and I'm so excited to be
filming this because it is a full face
using all elf cosmetics eyes lips face
cosmetics I tried a lot of things from
ELF in the past but this is like years
ago and they had some really really
amazing hits and some misses for me
definitely like most brands do
I don't absolutely love everything from
every single brand it's literally
impossible for me I haven't found a
brand that I've done a one brand
tutorial on where I lived for every
product there's always some type of
disappointment when Wilde was close
though because he hasn't push it so yea
that's what today's video is going to be
I'm gonna be doing a full face using all
elf cosmetics I literally went to Target
and bought like this massive massive bag
of makeup I already have all the
products you're still in boxes like so
I'm really excited from this video and I
hope you guys have enjoyed watching it
as always if you guys don't like this
video if you guys do not like me please
don't watch it you know the
drill with that
but if you guys do like this video
please subscribe to my channel if you're
not already and if you're new what's up
and man I am you Wayne welcome to my
channel thank you so much for being here
I really really appreciate it
Beata calling into this full face of
using only elf cosmetics okay we are
going to start this with some
primary we got a primer right here
excuse me so here we have the elf
poreless face primer should I do one of
these guys should I do like that every
product to be cute you know okay
so we're gonna do is we're gonna put
this on the face I mean it says it's a
poreless face primer I'm assuming to be
one of those silicone feeling primers
that's what I'm hoping for at least
filling in my hands it feels nice
oh my god that smells weird this smells
like actually okay you don't smells like
it smells like the dr. jart pores no
more that's what it smells like if you
guys ever smelled that it feels really
nice feels very very very smooth it
might be a little too smooth we'll see
cuz you know when like you use primers
that are too silicone e it like
everything just kind of sloths off your
face I'm gonna be taking the oil-free
SPF sunscreen flawless finish foundation
I grabbed it two shades I don't really
know what color would be I grabbed
natural and sand those like the lights
two shades hour at Target I love that I
have as a pump or my gone we have sand
right here I think I'm gonna go stand I
think we're gonna find and I grabbed a
little elfs beauty sponge I had no idea
Beauty sponges which is seriously Riku
and I'm going to take sand we're gonna
press out while we're the face this is
much more of a natural finish foundation
as I'm putting on right now I can notice
that like I don't see a lot of my skin
underneath it but it looks really
freaking pretty so far I'm kind of
living also this sponge it's a little
rough to me actually like it feels very
rubbery huh I don't know if I feel like
I'm living for the sponge to be honest
let's try it on a little brush I got one
of these elf brushes as well cuz it
looked like a nice brush this reminds me
of like a Sephora one when I worked on
safar they had a brush like this and I
was like using it so far I've used about
ten pumps for the face and I don't even
get have that much coverage which is a
little weird to me that's with using the
Beauty Blender so I'm gonna try it with
this brush and see how the coverage is
with the brush this brush is pretty nice
actually I don't think it's more of a
natural to medium coverage after even
building it out is what it looks like I
can definitely still see like my surreal
skin underneath it can still see the
redness of my pimples and like my little
acne spots and things like that but I
honestly think I stand really natural I
can definitely see myself using this
more like a day to day not good not
wanting to use an expensive s foundation
but still want a little bit of something
something for sure the problem with it
is that you have to use a lot a lot of
product which i thought was kind of
annoying to get to the coverage I have
right now so now for concealer I got
some concealers these are the HD lifting
concealer and I got the shade fair and I
got shade light so let's try the shade
fair first cuz it was literally such a
limited shade range at Target I was like
 oh my god it's so tiny I thought
doesn't make a long ass looking like
NARS bitch
woah woah you're gonna pull it out I
didn't realize hmm definitely a little
dark for me oh yeah oh oh yeah that's a
little dark we're gonna use a darker one
cuz I little bit more of an orange
undertone on the spot so I have a little
bit more darkness on the face it's like
my beard hair my circles on my eyes and
I'm gonna take the shade fair and I'm
gonna use that to actually like
highlight and make it look pretty you
know I'm actually really not the biggest
fan of these shades oh my god this is
like a beige like it's like a beige
concealer almost like I really I'm
really not a huge fan of this color so
let's blend this out
okay so I hate the color of the
concealer and I hate the coverage I
think it's not enough but the finish is
actually really pretty good too like a
really glowy skin like appearance we're
gonna make this work guys I'm gonna make
sure we look snatched this is a little
odd I have this foundation palette - and
Fairlight let's look at this looks like
they're all creams there's like this
yellowish shade right here what does
this look like you guys I feel like I
look really queasy I think that's how
you feel like look right now me just to
top it out of this to see what this
yellowy thing will do that'll kind of
brighten it up I feel this shade blend
aha
okay so this will you look like so far I
think the base look I mean the base
looks fine I just look really greasy and
oily and a little too like as if I
literally mixed a foundation with oil
that's how I feel it looks so now we're
gonna set it I grabbed the elf HD powder
HD powder sheer I don't really know
exactly what that entails bad at all
well that's still leaning on so now I'm
gonna take a little bit of oh it's
like I need just like a little white HD
powder you can work for Danny yeah so
we're gonna take that I'm gonna set
underneath eyes much better in my
opinion doesn't look so oily and so like
like scary looking let's take that
powder on the rest of the face as well
hey guys we have everything set in place
on efficient elbow right here in this
area right here is the missing
foundation when I was padding with a
powder the foundation literally came off
with it so I was like ah that doesn't
really normally happen but it did and
boards have to kind of roll with the
punches at this boy okay so I got this
little palette from of course of this is
a total face palette and it comes with
these shades right here and the shades
look really nice like I'm I want to try
these out them take it as a bronzer and
blush so we take the fullest face brush
from ELF as well and I'm gonna take this
little color right here and I'm going to
bronze up the perimeters of my face with
this shade and let's see how it works is
there any part being put down there's a
little bit of color coming off okay I
have to really really saturate the brush
to get any kind of pigmentation okay so
that is literally flopping for me right
now so we're gonna go in with this
guys I got another one just in case I
feel like I grab doubles of everything
how scared of a flop
st. Lucia blush and bronzing powder and
I'm taking this bronzer well this looks
a lot more pigmented whoo let's see oh
yeah whoa I was after the last one I was
not expecting that I don't know
dude I feel like it looks really patchy
what do you guys think I feel like it
looks a little phat true hmm okay let's
try this out again
you guys this powder is really really
bad she taking a big brush is blending
the whole thing
hopefully it'll marry a little bit
better okay so that looks better but it
was really really catchy so that's kind
of annoying but so let's go back to the
same palette and they take the blush oh
that's really pigment to it hmmm nice so
that works it's starting to build there
we go we're getting somewhere
three layers later we got somewhere okay
come on elf work with me here buddy took
about four layers but we definitely got
there there we go looks really nice
looks pretty I'm happy with that yeah
okay guys so now we're gonna highlight
the face and I grabbed this this is the
beautifully Barrett liquid highlighter
and I'm gonna put this down first and
then we're gonna go on top of it with
the powder highlighter that Mel has it
looks really nice on the hand I'm
actually really impressed so let's go
ahead and highlight with that and take
another little elf fresh okay let's try
this out and see how it applies on the
skin
Oh bitch
that is beautiful I'm sorry I'm a little
shaken we blend out that a little bit
god damn well not back in that oh my god
that's beautiful that is a
saving grace right there
Oh elf you did that girl you don't did
that one I can say that with certainty
that is my favorite product so far is
the highlighter Wow okay guys so this is
the base so far this is what we have I'm
not living for it to be quite honest the
only thing I'm living for is really the
highlighter and the foundation was
pretty once I got like ten pumps later
um I just feel like my face looks really
really patchy and I feel like everything
looks really harsh so I don't know I'm
not like living for this base or
anything I try to make it work as best
as I could um so let's go move on to the
brows in the eyes and see what we can
come up with okay guys I went in I
zoomed in a little bit closer so you
guys see everything a little bit more
clearly as you can see underneath my
eyes looks really heavy and cakey and
almost looks yellow it's really weird um
I thought there's like areas of
foundation and concealer missing we're
gonna keep it going and we're into our
hardest to look bomb okay I'm
not giving up on elf I'm not giving up
on health products I'm not they have
good okay so now we're
going to do our brows I'm gonna do like
the right brow on camera I found this
little brow pencil this guy right here
either just has a brow pencil in deep
brown and so I'm gonna try that out so I
have this one and I also have a little
brow kit the brow kit I have used before
and actually really really enjoyed it so
if this does not work and it's a mess
we're gonna use the brow kit okay so
what it looks like so far take a little
pen so that you twist up definitely
depositing some color oh girl
might be a little dark for me but hey
there's color coming off and I am very
happy with it
I mean this thing said I was deep brown
bitches his black the hook product
itself is actually really really really
waxy and it kind of picks up a little
funny on the brow but you know at least
it deposits the color and it definitely
gets the job done let's take this little
light brown color right here from the
dark brow kit and we're going to brush
that through does that do anything
honestly if anything at least it's to
set this waxy brow pencil in place now
taking the same concealer that we use
for underneath the eyes we're going to
try to carve out this under brow and see
how we got the broader look let's do a
little bit of a cheat to make our brows
a little bit lighter we're gonna take a
little bit that same concealer on this
little brush we're gonna run a little
bit of that concealer through the brow
hair to make it a little bit lighter cuz
gosh darn it that is some dark brows we
got a brow on guys we got a brow on
honey yes okay I'm gonna finish the
other brow off of camera and I'll be
right back
so now we have the brows on we're gonna
go ahead and move on it to the eyes I'm
gonna take the elf eyelid primer this is
a shadow lock eyelid primer you guys I
remember when I first first first
started using makeup I would use this
eyelid primer because it was opposed to
be a dupe for the Urban Decay primer
potion and I would use this primer all
the time so I can afford that okay which
I would use this one and they definitely
worked really really well so I'm really
excited to try this out again I mean my
expectations now with makeup are a
little bit different because I use
makeup every single day all day but
definitely back then when I was just
doing a little amounts of makeup it
definitely did the job so I would do
some eyeshadow and I grabbed two
palettes I've heard amazing amazing
things about the elf Prizm eyeshadows
I've never actually tried this
personally myself and I grabbed the
eyeshadow palette just the matte format
just cuz I want to do a really just cute
clean a basic look just what I wanted to
do I also grabbed one I grabbed the eyes
these two shadows this is a long lasting
lustrous eyeshadow and I grabbed this
smudge pot in Cruzan cheek cheek regime
chick I don't know so this is what the
palette looks like right here let's
swatch one there definitely they're
definitely pigmented we've got the two
swatches right there
they're pretty and we have this a matte
palette this house looks really nice I'm
excited try this out okay so let's start
to go in
this right here and a little bit of
this pinkier one right next to it these
two that's gonna go into the crease I've
not yet tried these so let's see how
they act well well there's definitely
definitely some pigment there guys that
looks really pretty oh my gosh yes we're
gonna make something happen guys we're
gonna make something happen here
now I'm taking more fewer 39 I'm gonna
take a little bit more of this
chocolatey brown shade they feel really
nice when I'm dipping my brush into it
guys I'm gonna put that on outer corner
you guys so far I'm actually really
impressed with this little palette the
shadows is it a little Apache yes it is
I think that was a little bit of work
and like some love you can definitely
definitely get a nice ass look I'm
taking that deepest darkest shade at the
very end I'm gonna take a little bit of
that I'm gonna take a little bit of that
I'm gonna put it on the outer corner
very low just to deepen the lashes out
here came easy now that we have the
crease colors down I think everything's
looking pretty freakin good I'm going to
take this little smudge pot this is in
the shade cruisin chick or sheet osek
this is literally like a little pot I
just watch a little bit on my hand and
this is what it looks like right here I
definitely don't hate it but I don't
love it either I just look at this guy
and see what this looks like this
soirÃ©e shade whoa this feels like goo
what the it's literally putty look
at the this I don't really like
either so I'm gonna choose the lesser of
two evils I'm gonna go with this smudge
pot you guys this is not going to be my
permanent lid shade i'm going in with
that prismatic shadow over top I just
wanted to have a base to make everything
pop a little bit more and that's why I'm
using this smudge pot I'm gonna take
this middle shade right here from the
prismatic palette I'm gonna Pat that
over top just to give us more of a
bright brightening effect so we have on
the eye so far it's like a smokey peach
is what I would describe this color as
on the lid thing looks really pretty I'm
gonna take the lightest prismatic shade
on a little tiny morphe m32 six favorite
small little packing brush for the inner
corner and a brow bone I'm gonna
highlight the inner corner with that
come on shade these prismatic shadows
I'm very impressed with mmm
I'm so sorry goddamn I'm gonna take this
little elf smudge pot imma take some oh
wait holy that was like so creamy
way hall that is pigmented when we
were using that but on a better brush no
offense
hmm Wow I was really impressed okay
let's do a little so look you guys look
up I went to that is holy Oh for
those wondering this is the morphe m25
0-0 it's a great little pencil brush for
cream liner you guys I'm so impressed
with how easily that glided on glid on
glide it on move oh no elf eye products
are really are really serving me right
now they are really giving it to me hard
so now that I'm living for the high and
I actually really think this is so
pretty this look come on alright I'm
gonna take the new formula elf
lengthening and volumizing mascara and
the shade black kanaka maole I'm not
really living for the mascara I feel
like it's really doing anything I just
like its coating my lashes to make a
little darker so I grabbed it these
little lashes from ELF these are the
luxe lash kit in winged and bold I don't
know that's what it's called winged and
bold these are the ones I grabbed they
look like a very very natural pair for
me this is like the most drag that they
add so uh yeah these lashes feel like
paper let's see how this goes bro no
where's the last shot okay I'll put on
another pair of lashes in a little bit
but we're going to take this palette
again and I'm gonna run that underneath
the lash line same colors that I
literally put on the upper lash line
just to kind of marry the whole look
together so it doesn't look too off on a
morphe 35o so grab this just to add a
pop of something this is the teal tease
eyeliner and I kind of want to put it on
these waterline just kind of give me a
little bit of edge
and sex appeal same style as the black
one I think it's going to be similar
yeah it's definitely similar feeling
creamy as hell which is cool not as
pigmented the black one but we're gonna
put that in the lower lash line okay I'm
gonna go put on another pair of lashes
really quickly just cuz I feel like this
is looks so funny and I'll be right back
to do our lips and then we'll be done
time it wasn't on and I just did my lips
okay guys
sorry you guys I totally did not know
what that my sound was off of this what
we decided to do is I use the lip liner
in the shade natural and the elf
day.tonight lipstick duo in needed nudes
and that's what we decided to do on the
lips today and I think it looks
fantastic it blended so nicely it was
super creamy super pigmented and I was
very very pleased with it and that's how
you guys that's it for the full face
using elf cosmetics video having signed
fun watching at so much fun crane this
video I had my verdict on these products
is a lot of them worked fantastically a
lot of them did not work too the way I
wanted them to work I would definitely
say that my favorite products today that
I used or the eye products I thought the
eye products worked so well honestly
things worked as if they were high-end I
were so impressed I'm really impressed
with the eye look I did today we using
only elf products I'm not so impressed
with the base products like the stuff
for my face I thought I thought a lot of
it was really really patchy and I'd like
the coverage of a lot of things I just
don't think my face looks really good
right now um it looks really really oily
and kind of greasy and that's with
setting it with powder and I don't know
I just don't really I'm not the biggest
biggest fan of how everything turned out
on the face the highlight turned out to
be sick nasty butter than that
I'm not really impressed with anything
else I also really really really enjoyed
the lip products as well they feel so
nice and so luxurious on the lips and
they are super pigmented super creamy I
was very impressed with that stuff so
all in all I think elf is a definite win
in my book Elle has some amazing
products I just don't really like how
the base for now buzz and I think
they're not really really nice you guys
have any other brands that you guys
would like to see me doing a full face
of let me know in the comments bar below
and I'll definitely definitely get that
done whether it's drugstore high end any
brand that you guys want to see do a
full face of I could definitely make it
happen if they have a full face of those
product move yeah guys I hope you guys
