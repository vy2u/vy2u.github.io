in today's video as you can see from the
title is going to be a full face using
only wet and wild products I've been
doing full face using one brand videos
for so long since like the beginning of
my channel why am i winded
oh god I'm out of shape I think there's
so much fun to film because they're kind
of a challenge like if I don't have a
lot of the products I'll just kind of
try to make it work with what I have
like a deal with last maybelline one but
this time I came more prepared I went
out and bought so much wet and wild
products I literally bought like one of
everything to see if I could actually
use a full face of just wet and wild I
have not tried a lot of these products
I'm talking like most of these products
I've not tried so this is gonna be a
first impressions and full face using
wet and wild products this is not
sponsored by wet and wild I wish it was
I wish you guys actually know who knows
what if I like some shit my likes I'm
sure that's gonna fucking suck but yeah
guys that's what's gonna be today's
video I'm super excited to film this and
yeah it's gonna get right into it as
always if you guys don't like this video
if you guys do not like me please don't
fucking watch it you know the drill with
that do not subject yourself to watching
something you don't like because I don't
give a thought but you guys do like this
video please subscribe to my channel if
you aren't already and yeah let's go to
get to this full face using wet and wild
products I started I love you went to
CVS spent about 100 bucks on wet and
wild products literally this whole bag
is completely filled with wet and wild
shit got my real sweet that's a long
we're soon tell me I'm not sound like
we'll make it well first things first
guys we're going to try the wet and wild
coverall primer base this is just a
primer that when well has I've never
tried this I've never tried most of
these products it's completely sealed
let's see what it feels like okay it
feels like a moisturizer feels very
smooth going on the skin I particular
almost hydrating what the fuck so this
guy says that it's a magic potion that
it refines pores it fills fine lines of
brightens complexion even skin tone no
no no no that looks pretty much the same
to me but uh I don't move on camera I
look a little bit different to you guys
what do you think did do you feel like
it's smooth out my pores I don't I
really don't see it but maybe did I just
like I look more matte but socially
mattifying primer so hey guys so I
grabbed the wedding
out a photo focus a foundation I've
heard great things about this foundation
like I really really have it I've heard
it's amazing so I really want to try
this out I grab the color buff bisque
there was a very very low color
selection at the store so I'm like just
we're just gonna kind of troubleshoot
this and just pray that it's somewhat
okay honestly this is not really my
shade but when do I match my sheet never
bitch no burn okay that's that's totally
enough like that is enough grabbing a
beauty blender go ahead and blend this
out and see how it looks the foundation
smells a little funny it's a little
strong so far looking really nice oh my
gosh okay living god the smell is so
strong though it smells like fucking
paint what coverage is like a medium to
foolish coverage foolish as a slight
sheen to it but it's not like do you by
any means to me it looks more on the
matte side more of a satin finish keep
on a real level like I'm really
impressed there should have six bucks I
can see that's getting a little bit
darker on my skin is it oxidizing my
neck is definitely a different color
than my face
luckily at powder I can kind of put down
there hopefully it'll match honestly it
set so fast though I was like like I was
shooken how fast it set I had no ideas
and set this quickly but honestly I'm
really not mad I think it's really
pretty thing the coverage is really
pretty and I'm actually really excited
to keep trying this out because it looks
really nice is next let's go with some
concealer I bought this one this is the
photo focus concealer I grabbed it in
the lightest shade this is in the shade
ivory light I struggle with getting
product out of applicators like this I
had to dip in maybe like three times per
eye it's like okay you didn't realize
we're doing all that but we're getting
there were getting there
okay the color is nice it's nice and
light it'll really highlight me I think
do this color is really oxidizing on me
in my trip one or is it oxidizing as
fuck okay blend the concealer hey that's
looking really nice guys looking nice
though
uh-huh it looks so pretty okay cool I'm
into that this stuff sets so quickly I'm
like what the fuck is in here glue oh my
god I have to like fucking hurry okay
now to set the entire face in place I
rhymed
I'm dr. Seuss I'm taking a photo finish
pressed powder this is the shade right
here I grabbed in the shade buff I take
a little bit on put that underneath the
eye so so white under-eye concealer
please don't change the color please
a little darker than me but please and
we're actually put that all over the
face with this little wet and wild
kabuki brush so far the color selection
I chose is uh not my color it is not my
color
so my gonna grab my darker shade I
grabbed too cuz it's gonna be like my
bronzer a shade I want to use as a
bronzer
put that down the neck trying to match
up my uh my neck to my face I suppose so
I don't you guys know this I'm sure you
guys have noticed it before but here I
have discoloration on my neck I don't
really know why it's like just dark here
I was like there's like a darkness there
it's almost as if someone like choked me
out it's so weird like I don't know why
I have it but I just have discoloration
there I wonder has anything to my
vitiligo but I don't think it does cuz
it's dark now I'm take a little bit of
that same tan color I'm jump a little
bit on like the right here on the
perimeters of my face
I'll say I hate this brush I might even
eat this we don't know this tan color
though is actually so fucking pretty as
a bronzer holy shit oh my god I'm a
fucking idiot I'm a fucking idiot what I
could have done is I could use this
thing to put underneath my ice to set my
under eyes but I forgot my hand me you
guys wanna take this wet wild
highlighting and contouring palette I'm
gonna take the lightest shade and put
underneath my eyes just to brighten up
everything again is gonna brighten it up
oh it is oh it is
come on son and also this is in the
shade dulce de leche no okay let's try
the darker color right here the contour
shade on my trusty morphe y9 best
contour brush I've ever gotten it's so
amazing I'm just sayin and put that into
the contour areas you know that looks
it's a little more warm than I would go
for a contour shade honestly it's a nice
cool tone as I was thinking it was going
to be but honestly it's not bad that's
not bad at all okay guys so you but okay
this just fell out of this I just want
to talk about this this just fell out of
this I would love to know
who on this earth is going to use this
motherfucker right here this little
thing for their cheeks okay guys so I'm
gonna grab the shade a pearlescent pink
on my morphe 4 and I'll put that into my
blush sheet areas and see how this looks
okay okay that's such a beautiful ass
color what the fuck is blending so
easily
wait I've never tried wet and wild
blushes before are we onto something
here or mommy's slightly shook a little
okay guys so the only highlighter that
they had at the store was this one this
is in the shade crown of my canopy
that's not a shape that's not the shade
crown of my canopy that's the name of
this crowd of my canopy okay then this
is the color here it's not really a
bright hiding color I just they did not
have one at the store so I'm like fuck
man and I don't have any of the other
highlighters here I have them back at my
house in like San Diego so I'm like okay
well I'm just gonna use crowd with my
canopy on this morphe 12 brush okay I
see I see it's like a pinkish like a
pinky highlighter it's such a beautiful
color it's not blinding or anything this
is actually more so a blush topper I
would say if I could out go in with a
lighter color this is a little dark for
me but it honestly looks so beautiful
I'm not mad
so I also grabbed this little palette
this is the color icon comfort zone
palette and I want it just to grab this
brow bone color because it looks like a
light champagne tone so I don't have a
little bit of that and put that on the
top of my highlight I think just to see
if it'll give me a more of a brighter oh
yeah that worked great okay guys so so
far this is the face honestly and I'm
not mad at it what so ever as we want to
the brows and the eyes you guys so I got
this little ultimate brow kit by
wet-and-wild and I'm going with the
brows on this this is in the shade
hashed Brown so it's what the little kit
looks like obviously this looks a lot
lighter than my tone oh it comes with a
little tweezer so guys what we're gonna
do now is gonna fill in our brows using
this thing isgetting like this it's such
a cheap little thing let's just
what's going with this lightest brownish
color here I want to fill them the
beginning part of my brows with that
just to see if it would actually fill in
at all because it's so light way way too
light so we're gonna go with the darker
brown pray that the darker Brown oh yeah
much better I just I have to go with the
darker Brown there's no way in fucking
hell I've been felt in my brows with
powder and so along I'm like this is so
weird to me fill in your shape whatever
shape you want to do oh I guess we're
going
dickham's today okay I'm gonna go finish
the other brow off of camera and I'll be
right back good guys the brows are on
they're a little bold they're little
intense
and they're a little dark but with what
I have this is all I can really do right
now so don't you yes I already
underlined them with concealer
underneath the bottom to really sharpen
them up but now that we're done with the
brows I'm gonna go and finish off with
the eyes now I'm just gonna take that
same concealer that we use the photo
focus concealer and I'm gonna use it as
my eye primer cuz the concealer worked
really nicely underneath my eyes didn't
increase a lot it's still not really
crusing that much and it gave me a nice
coverage so I thought why not try it on
the lids as well Oh amazing so now with
that same kabuki brush just gonna
literally press over with whatever
powder we have left to set the concealer
in place okay guys so I grabbed this
palette this is the own etro palette in
the shade nude awakening so I don't
really ever really use a lot of
drugstore pellets things like that I've
heard just terrible things about
literally all of them were made oh I
should definitely use this brush that
came with definitely this this is what
the palette looks like right here has a
lot of colors in it my game let's watch
couple
well that's a chunky estoy ever swatched
a minute so I'm gonna go in with this
really pretty neutral color here
Animorph eu27 a blending brush that's
gonna go right into the crease and I
mean so far the colors going on it's
blending I don't hate it
taking this maroon shade that's
pigmented though that that's really
that's pigmented oh yeah oh yeah shit
that was much more painted I thought I
was going to because the last color was
not as crazy so we're gonna try to blend
child please we have that nice purpley
color down much more because I thought I
was gonna be truly and not trying to be
a bitch but I was gonna be shit okay so
I think I'm gonna do is I want to cut
that crease taking the same concealer or
take that on a morphe and four-to-one
best detail lightening type brush for me
I just love this one so much you guys
I've talked about this so many times I'm
just going to carve out okay I'm talking
like a fool like a full fucking cut
crease like a full moment nice okay guys
so this is what I have so far okay guys
so if you constantly add that purple and
just build it and build it a little bit
with a small detail brush this one is
the morphe 36 i just keep building up
that color you will get something like
this just an easy casual cut crease with
the perps looking good because of the
concealer is there it's kind of creasing
a little bit so we want to really set
that quickly actually I'm actually gonna
take that same highlighting shade that
we put underneath our eyes all right
actually put that on to the eyes to
avoid everything from creasing just set
everything in place if you have lids
like me you can take your lids creasing
and uh folding over so easily and this
way should have so far hell yeah bitch
looking fucking pretty bitch yeah bitch
let's do some eyeliner better eye in
line so I grabbed the Wet n Wild mega
liner this is a liquid eyeliner and it
is a felt-tip fuck I hate felt-tip I
always use brush tips but it's fine okay
it's black as fuck that's awesome I'm
gon be careful cause do wing
okay guys this what we have so far
cute little cat pink moon taking that
same loan natural palette taking that
brow bone and actual gonna put on the
brow bone this time for real just gonna
highlight the brow bone a little bit
okay guys on this we should have at the
top of the eye is looking keep looking
good go I'm gonna finish the other eye
off of camera and I'll be right okay
guys so due to the fact that the
applicator is not the applicator I'm
used to the liner just kept getting
bigger and bigger and thicker so we have
the top of the eye completely done I'm
basically done this is what I want it to
be on my next keep it at that so we're
gonna do is wanna take this nude liner
pencil Kohl took a Kohl pencil is the
biggest pencil I've ever tried fucking
what is this a fucking 9 inch or here
and we're gonna run that nude underneath
our waterline and now what we're gonna
do is gonna blend a little bit of to the
contour shade underneath the lashes so
doesn't it just like literally nothing
there so it takes two mascara this is a
new mascara I believe that they just
came out with this is the renegade
mascara lash the fucking packaging is so
sick it's like a diamond D weird as heck
like package which I love you know I
like lift for some weird if it's a weird
if it's some weird sham down okay so
this is the applicator it sounds like a
little weird ball at the end of it okay
lashes are curled and now I'm taking the
renegade lash mascara I just love this
component I really really do I think
it's so fucking sick nasty like I can't
get over it when use this mascara ain't
raining it's supposed to give length and
volume but I think I did definitely give
me a length and volume I'm just not like
really in love love love with it but
we're gonna just put it on okay great so
I have some lashes on right now I'm
wearing some Bella's buy a new bounce um
you guys already know this is the
homegirl lash for real this is the
homegirl lash finally we're on to the
lip I bought three of their liquid
lipsticks I didn't know which one I
wanted to try out I'm thinking I'm gonna
go with this berry one cuz it's very
like monochromatic and I heard these are
great so I want to try this out so it's
funny how this is the exact same
packaging as Jeffrey's packaging
coincidence
I'm gonna put on the shade Barry
recognized let's try this pleasantly
surprised with pigmentation great not to
turn into pink that's what - uh layers -
layers to get full opacity for five
bucks this is amazing
and that's at you guys that's it for the
entire video using all wet and wild
products a lot of this is the first
impressions I've literally never tried
so many different things but I'm
honestly so beyond impressed with
everything so far I don't think my face
looks bad whatsoever I don't think it
looks like drugstore I think it just
looks really really pretty the only
thing I was like someone disappointed in
was the shadows but the shadows were not
that bad it just in comparison to
everything else I was actually really
really nice and good on me the shadows
were my least favorite thing but
honestly like the face are not really
nicely and I'm not mad at it whatsoever
I hope you guys enjoyed this video let
me know if you guys want me to do more
of these videos these full-face using
one brand videos like a first
impressions or just trying things out
for the first time or whatever it may be
I love doing these videos they're so fun
they're really random and really fun and
they're kind of a challenge sometimes
but I think that's what makes it so much
more fun and I'm doing with the
drugstore brand you know the last one I
did was with Maybelline and had fun
doing that one being that was a
drugstore brand was much more attainable
and when wild is another brand that's
much more attainable as well and if
there's any other brand they guys want
me to do a full face of let me know in
the comments bar below and like this
