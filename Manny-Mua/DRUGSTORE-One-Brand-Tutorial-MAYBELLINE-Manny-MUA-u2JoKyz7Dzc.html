it says video as you can see from the
title is going to be a full face using
only Maybelline products I have not done
a full face using one brand video and so
freaking long and I'm so excited doing
this because one because it's a
drugstore brand it's freakin Maybelline
this is so accessible it's so much more
cost-efficient for you guys to get these
items than it is to get higher end
brands and for the second reason I'm so
excited because I am working with
Maybelline I'm so excited and so honored
to be working with Maybelline we did the
campaign for Big Shot together and it's
been such a crazy whirlwind of the past
couple months because the press and
everything's been so insanely large and
crazy from it that I was like holy crap
this is a huge deal and it has been such
a crazy amazing moment and I'm so beyond
proud and I'm so beyond thankful to that
Maybelline chose me to be one of their
spokespeople and a model for them and I
can't even describe how blessed I feel
from this one opportunity and like I
don't wanna wear any lashes today
because I just felt like I owed it to
Maybelline because I am one of their
spokesmodels for bakeshop mascara and I
wanted to just let the mascara speaks
for itself and I just get so many tweets
and positive messages from you guys and
comments everywhere saying that you guys
have seen the campaign and it just makes
me feel so blessed life can change so
fast in three years and it's just such
an amazing amazing experience and I'm so
so grateful and I'm so grateful to you
guys for being along with the journey
with me and thank you so much for
allowing me to do what I love and I
cannot thank you guys enough I think you
guys every single day and yeah that's
what day's video is going to be to me
full face using just Maybelline products
I don't have a ton and ton of Maybelline
products like I thought I had more than
I did but I think I made this look work
and it just are really pretty natural
everyday look so yeah it's going into
this video as always if you guys want
this video if you guys don't like me
please don't watch it you know
lijo with that but you guys do like the
video please subscribe to my channel if
you aren't already and if you knew
what's up
and Manny anyway and welcome to my
channel thank you so much for being here
and yeah it's going to get into this
full face using only Maybelline products
video
okay guys let's go and start on today's
video I am so excited to be doing this
full face using only Maybelline products
I've not done a full face using one
brand products video and so freaking
long it's been forever it's just like Oh
drugstore brand I don't think I've done
a drugstore brand one since I did one
with NYX and that was like I don't even
know over a year ago so I'm so excited
doing this I don't have everything from
the line I do have a lot of things
though so I'm hoping that I can make at
least one look work with these items I
don't have everything from the line
though at all so let's just start with
what I do have so it's going to start
off by priming the skin I don't have a
primary from them I have the mist and
fix locket makeup setting spray so I'm
gonna do them astray this first and then
I'm gonna go over this with some
foundation just to kind of sandwich in
the base of my face basically face a
face okay great so once that settles
into the face I'm gonna be going in with
some foundation I'm gonna be taking the
Maybelline matte and poreless foundation
the fit new one I absolutely love long
they sound banking building I wish I had
was a pump like I wish shows like a pump
on this other than that it's a beautiful
ass foundation and I wear all the time
it's one of my favorite drugstore
foundations ever so I'm gonna go ahead
and put that on my t-zone because it is
a more of a matte mattifying foundation
but not like too matte it's like a
pretty matte it's not like matte where
you have no shine whatsoever this is
like a satin matte finish and I'm going
to shade 1:28 I'm gonna put that all
over the skin mostly in the t-zone is
there not such a pretty foundation like
it just looks so pretty and natural but
still gives you such a nice coverage
like I just really like I'm gonna go for
more of a natural look today I decided I
decided right now I want to go with a
really pretty natural ass still stunning
as hell look all right so now I'm gonna
be taking the new foundation this is the
dream cushion liquid foundation on the
go I have not tried this yet literally
I'm like undoing your Hank now this is
in the shade 20
I am hoping this is my color to a
cushion and I'm just gonna take a more
feet 6 when I bounce that into the brush
and go on the fit oh hi oh my gosh just
gives you like some good coverage though
and it's giving me like a lifelike
luminous finish
that's really pretty do you see that oh
my god I'm like shook honestly that's
nice
I've been try together this is so sick
it gives a nice a medium coverage it's
not too full but I think it's buildable
I'm going with a little bit more on the
cheeks right here and just even builds
and it does do it it friggin does oh my
god like first impressions right now I'm
very impressed it gives you as you can
see it's a very luminous finish but it
gives you a nice amount of coverage I
mean I'm using it with this kind of
brush I don't know how the coverage
would be used on a beauty blender i
would suggest cushion foundations on a
brush though i just my personal opinion
now for some concealer i'm gonna go in
with the Maybelline master conceal in
the shade light and I've been I've
talked about this concealer so many
times on my channel I just absolutely
love it so much because you're such an
amazing amount of coverage it gives you
basically full ass coverage and it
doesn't feel too heavy on the skin so
imma put that underneath my eyes and any
other areas that kind of wanna highlight
in the center of the forehead I'm not
going to be runner and I'm gonna bounce
out if concealer god this concealer so
 Friday oh my god no honestly
guys I've used this so many times it's
absolutely beautiful
and the coverage is amazing so as you've
heard drugstore concealer like this is
full coverage man like come on amazing
and now I'm letting that kind of settle
in I'm gonna take this what is this
master contour stick is like a two side
I machine use a sculpting sign relita
oh that's cool tone well that's cool
tone okay nice I honestly wasn't
expecting that okay great so now let's
go ahead and I never do this with like
okay I'm sorry I'm like really shook
right now because I don't ever do cream
contouring really so I'm just gonna okay
I'm gonna booty it in very nice and
lightweight it's not too heavy on the
skin at all so as you can see it blended
out pretty freakin easily I'm just gonna
put on a little bit more cuz I think I
blended it a little too harsh because I
don't see a lot of a lot of freaking
color left there I think when it comes
to this product itself I would use that
same stippling brush to keep the
coverage and the color there I think
that if you're using a Beauty Blender it
will wipe away too much it'll blend up
too much product so now guys I'm gonna
be going in with this master fix setting
and perfect loose powder of course by me
then I'm gonna put that underneath my
eyes to set the concealer
setting powder is a translucent setting
powder you see this you see this on
camera tell me why it just blurred out
underneath my eyes this is the first
time I'm trying this powder and I'm
honestly shook do you see how blurred my
under-eye looks I mean I know it looks
Matt obviously because it's a matte I
can mattifies your skin but it looks
blurred oh my let me read this real
quick okay this is a blur mm-hmm sets
mattifies blurs and smoothes um I
believe it all literally just blurred
out my skin that's really like
you just okay so this is a silica powder
though this reminds me very much of the
makeup forever loose powder that white
loose powder just be cautious of this
powder because it is a silica based
powder and you want to make sure that
you're not going to be doing a lot of
flash photography with this powder
because it will flashback silica flashes
back but it looks so pretty and smooth
on the skin when it's on oh my gosh tell
me why my face has never looks smoother
than it does right now it looks
blurred a drugstore version of the mega
forever powder because look I mean look
at the effect I'm blurred my skin is
blurred okay now I'm gonna go in with
this which is another product I have not
tried so this is the maybelline
superstay better skin skin transforming
powder I'm assuming it is a foundation
powder somers to put a little bit on a
morphe - and I'm gonna brush out over
the face just give me a little more
color back because usually when you're
going in with those silica powders you
can get like a little bit of a white
cast so I'm gonna go ahead and run that
through right down the neck a little bit
because oh this is not my color
haha now my god it's fine in the shade
25 nude beige look how light that looks
it totally transferred darker on my skin
that's fine let me just say I'm very
pleasantly surprised with this whole
thing so far honestly honestly honestly
so now more base products are going to
be ensued this is the Maybelline master
contour in the shade light to medium
face contouring kit comes with a contour
a blush and a highlight sums that are
going to do all three of them and kill
it in 1:1 easy
so I'm gonna be taking this on a morphe
white nine favorite contour brush I'm
just going to contour on top of the
cream that I used earlier that is
working it's a nice cool toned color you
guys this might be drugstore this might
be a drugstore tutorial but we are gonna
look so high-end honestly another
pleasant surprise right here again um
maybe it's also cuz I'm because it's
drugstore even more lenient because it's
a greater price plan hmm okay more 50
for blush a blush and put it on the
blush parts pigmented pigmented I never
do colors like this actually for blush
and never blush this color woah it's
like really pink for me I'm used to very
like apricot warm corals this is
straight-up pink oh I don't know when I
use my something pink whoa not pink
blush not in pink blush not at all now
we're gonna take the highlighter my
favorite painting and we'll take that
anamorphic why 14 let's see how this I
haven't used this guy's at all yeah
that's why I'm like very intrigued let's
see how this works what are we thinking
when we thinking it's not one of those
pow crazy blinding highlights not to me
at least for being in this little trio
like it's not bad at all no no no okay
now I'm done with the base the base is
basically done I think it looks
absolutely beautiful do a little more of
this to take away that powdery look ooh
what if okay what if we do this what we
do some of the fix the missing fix we'll
spray the brush no wonder these words do
that no wonderful Oh yep yep yep
yep yep yep that is what I was going for
out there son
amazing okay cool so now we have the
base out what I want it to be let's go
ahead move on to the eyes and the brows
okay so I don't actually have any brow
pencils from Maybelline right now my mom
took all the ones that I had because we
went to Aspen together as you guys know
women's asters together she brought all
the makeup with her and her
bag I forgot to give him mine so brow
pencils that I have in her bag
all right home so what I do have though
I least I have the brow precise fiber
volumizing brow products from Maybelline
so I can use that at least on my brows
it looks like this it's like a little
looks like a little iron brow fibers I'm
just gonna comment through my brows and
see what we can get done with this
that's already filling in so well yes
God take that mom I'll need my brow
pencils I know I do
honestly new GM back doing this kind of
video it's a cup a challenge but it's
all about trying to make what the
products that you do have work that's
kind of the fun of it you know I know
you guys like it when I struggle mm-hmm
remember the old videos when I would do
something and I would up you guys
were like and just loved it when I
struggled so I'm like okay well yes
sweet I'm gonna use that master conceal
one more time and I'm gonna take it on a
little morphe m42 one which is the best
for using it with concealer honesty's my
favorite brush to use it for my brows
like I'm a carve-out brows kind of girl
so a little messy and little flurry but
we're gonna use the concealer to clean
them up to make a look like that's what
the goal was for bold furry brow I say
flurry or D oh my god against big did I
say flurry earlier I'm used to a much
cleaner more intense browser than this
but for the challenge I think I made it
work you know what I did the best I
could
okay I do the Thank You Man game so I
went ahead my pride my lids with the
same concealer this is the concealer I
use on new my eyes and I set it with the
same translucent powder the master fix
so now I'm gonna go on with the eye
color
I don't have a iPad from them with me
right now so what we're gonna do we're
gonna use that same master conceal
palette and one of their single shadows
and we're gonna make some magic happen
okay the first thing we're gonna take
that contour color and we're gonna use a
fluffy brush this is the Y 16 fluffy
brush and we're put that into the crease
yeah hell yeah
but to the crease this look is gonna be
a really natural eye look because I'm
not gonna be wearing falsies with this
because I am part of the lash campaign
and I just feel like I want to not wear
lashes for this you know like I feel
like I owe it to myself and to
Maybelline to not wear lashes because we
did it get being together come and put
this into the crease I'm doing a light
wash of
color really quickly and then why my
dues I'm gonna take a more compact
smaller brush take that same color I'm
really going to pack it on the outer
corner to add a little bit more
dimension and depth as you can see when
you blend it with a fluffy brush that's
like really loose and fluffy it's gonna
give you a really light wash of color
but now I'm gonna go in with a more
concentrated brush and it's gonna give
me a darker more intense version of the
color which will add a different form of
dimension which I love as you can see
using different brushes adds different
effects to makeup so I love that I love
that I love that time for a little brow
bone highlight action with the
highlighter this little tiny more feed
em three to six brush just to give them
a brows a little bit of a lift so now
what we're gonna do is I'm gonna take
this single shadow by Maybelline this is
in the shade
I think nude glow I think I rubbed off
the back of excitin the thing and I
think it's new glow but I remember
seeing this so the first time i swatched
it and i was so impressed with how
beautiful it was
so i'm gonna take on the lid today i'm
put that all over the lid
like a really pretty like champagne like
a topi champagne color run on the lid
just a light layer i really pretty just
seen this color does take a little bit
of building but they're they're really
just pretty lightweight champagne pink a
color and it just looks like pretty it's
just a really pretty natural looking
color which i am going for pate and
taking another one this isn't a shade
the glow down which is a really pretty
yellow gold I'm gonna put that on inner
corner and see if that works
ooh yes to the golden champagne color
taking a little pencil brush in that
same contour color I'm gonna run that
underneath my eyes doesn't give me a
little bit of cohesiveness with this
look so since I don't have any eyeliner
in them either I'm gonna take this lip
liner in the shade Chuck rich chocolate
I'm gonna run that on my lash line very
a little bit just that give me a little
nugget of definition nothing to him
because I just don't want to just a
little bit right here I took a really
warm brown and just blending that out a
little bit
this is a lip liner but makeup has no
role bitch you got no rules like that
there's a little nugget of some color on
the lash line come on maybe we maybe
he's one with the bitch that's right
that's right he's born with it okay so
we have the eyes basically done this is
such a really pretty just natural look
for me what I'm making in your work so
now for the most important part the
mascara I'm so excited to be doing this
just because I am part of the Big Shot
mascara campaign with Maybelline and
being that I'm the first male
spokesperson for me Blaine it's just
such a huge honor and I couldn't be more
like proud to be working with them and
I'm so so excited to even use this on my
lashes right now assumption of curl my
lashes let's go in with the colossal Big
Shot mascara bye
those lashes wipe a little bit mascara
on the bottom left line
I love how Big Shot makes my bottom
lashes look honestly they look so full
and so intense and just so like right
which I love and now that we're done
with the mascara and the eyes just a
little some some really natural just
right cute prod me I'm gonna take the
lip liner in the shade purely nude
closed and sectional shaping lip liner
that was so creamy
QAF color till and then for lipstick I
of course I'm going to be taking the
shade beige babe by the millions and I
figure it nude lipstick at the moment
it's so so good and this is the final
look using full face using only
Maybelline products how long has it been
since I've done a look without lashes
