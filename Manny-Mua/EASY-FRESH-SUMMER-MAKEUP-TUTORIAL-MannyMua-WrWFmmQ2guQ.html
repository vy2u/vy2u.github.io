today's video is going to be a natural
glowy tutorial I've been wanting to do I
look like this for a while now I really
love doing natural glam as well not just
like full coverage like full glam winged
liner to your temples red cut creases
like I love doing all that stuff too but
I also like to do really natural looks
as well not everyone's gonna want to do
an intense cut crease every single day
yeah
I'm not going started getting into this
video now as always if you guys like
this video if you guys don't like me
please don't you okay just don't
watch it you know just don't
watch it you guys don't like me you guys
don't like my videos don't watch it
don't even subject yourself to that
 but if you guys do like this
video and you guys do like me please

to any channel if you want already and
if you knew what's up a mini MUA and
thank you for coming to my channel and
checking it out and being part of the
man yak family
so let's go and start this video of fair
face and nothing on my face right now at
all I'm gonna do a full face video today
I'm gonna take the dr. Brandt pores no
more and that's going to go on the
center of my face and blending outwards
I just really really enjoy this primer a
lot because it's so good at keeping the
oiliness of my face at bay and you guys
know I am oily as a oil truck
come in I'm going with the new
foundation today I'm going to be taking
the Koh Gendo High Definition makeup
foundation I've never tried this on
nation it's like an aqua foundation and
the shade one two three I have
thank you so much shout out to coach
endo for sending this to me they sent me
this foundation and they sent me this
color so let's hope and pray that it's
the right color I'm gonna be taking that
on a morphe and four three nine of
course whenever I have like a more
voluminous aqua foundation I like to go
in more of a dense brush because it
won't soak up as much product as a
beauty blender will nice color matching
skills guys nice color managing the
color is actually very accurate for my
face it's just lighter than what I like
to do you guys know moment wants to be
tennis look this gives a beautiful
finish like beautiful and it's very
buildable as you can see it does build
up very very nicely it's not as full
coverage as I want but I'm really not
going for a full coverage look today
employ more of a natural look so I like
it we're gonna go pretty lightweight
with the concealer I'm gonna be taking
the Urban Decay Naked skin concealer
gorgeous concealer I love this one it's
full coverage it's lightweight honestly
I don't really have any qualms with this
concealer and I never have so I'm really
going for a really nice fresh look today
not super crazy not to pretend super
drag like I like to do usually just a
little more brightness I'm gonna have
this the dandelion shy beam by Benefit
just a little bit just to add some more
brightness I'm just gonna Pat that in
just to brighten an awake in the look
mmm go ahead and set the concealer I'm
taking the Laura Mercier translucent and
just lightly going over be concealed and
brightened areas just cuz I don't want
any pre-staged happening mmm the set of
face we're gonna take the Naked skin
Urban Decay ultra definition loose
powder every time I say that that is do
measure me am should has lightly set the
entire face with this this is a nice HD
powder it's not as heavy as Laura
Mercier one but is a beautiful setting
powder to set the face and it is an HD
finish
it's gonna be beautiful and it's not
gonna be too heavy it's gonna be just
enough taking some Mac Studio Fix powder
and take that nutmeg just to match up
the face a little bit you guys don't
want to be two-tone I mean I like to
leave the duochrome to the shadows not
to the face come on let's match up here
okay now taking some trusty hoola
bronzer you guys already know I've went
through this phase right now where it's
like only hoola bronzer and Marc Jacobs
bronzer like I've not used any other
brothers besides those because I just
fell in love with him I'm just going to
bronze up the temples a little bit hula
is such a pretty color it's like such a
natural bronzer it really does look like
you're like sunkissed rather than being
so like orange or grey it's just like
such a good neutral color I love this
bronzer I always have that spot
on my face that doesn't take pigment I
try like blow a bubble to make it get in
there and it just doesn't work does not
 work let's do a bit of no
snatching just real quick I'm gonna take
the morphe 28 and the makeup geek cool
porcelain contour powder and I'm gonna
start contouring the nose slightly just
to give me a nice skin Tino I put on too
much miron's around the nose and now it
looks like I just snorted to
concentrate for the nose contouring they
can go south so quick you're gonna cook
the nose to make it look decent because
I feel I'm looking a little cracky okay
taking Laura Mercier chancers and
setting powder on a morphe m45 heat cook
the sides of the nose to make it look
sharper I'm gonna let that rest for a
moment and just cook into the nose and
I'm standing on the bottom of the
bronzer as well just a very tiny amount
because I don't want to be too contour
today I'm going for more of a natural I
mean as Naturals you're going to get for
me I'm gonna go into my e49 brush by
morphe just a little tapered little
cuteness brush and I'm gonna go into the
glow kit Brown associate the back glow
kit because I'm studying I'm gonna dip
into bubbly and sunburst these two sides
would like the two top ones right here
and dip into the both of those and start
highlighting the mug
dude the glow kids like ridiculous the
glow kids are so pop this is why
they were my favorite video of mine
Becca Wow honey more 53 blend between
the bronzer and the highlighter Becca
wild honey and Mac warm soul top two
blushes of literally all-time and I like
this one because it's more of a burnt
apricot color and which is great for
more of a bronzey look it's not super
like blushy it's a very pretty bronzy
natural blush color go ahead and rush
away the little nose contour the funny
thing about nose contouring sometimes
you can beat the bitch into the
ground chisel her down to nothing to a
toothpick and sometimes you have bad
days and today's not my day okay today's
not idea with the nose we're gonna move
on or you move on to the eyes the face
is done I like how it looks I think it
looks very pretty
bronzy glowing and now let's move on to
the guys so basically just my life
I finished filming the entire eye look
thinking it was on camera of course
thinking it's on camera of course and
turns out I didn't film any of it it was
the off the entire time
mm-hmm so how to wipe off one eye so I
could show you guys what to do oh so
let's go and start this one more
time I'm gonna take the mac pro longwear
concealer and I'm gonna prime my lids
with this concealer I actually learned
this chick from jacqueline hill and the
olden days when I watched her old videos
who'd actually use a pro longwear
concealer all the time as primer on her
eyes and then I started using it and Max
I'm like I'm trying to like what
Jacqueline's talking about when I was
working at Mac and it worked really
really well so I'm like you know what
let's do that again around May oh well
so I can run out so shout out to
Jacqueline again back at it
again with the tips and tricks
this look is so freakin easy guys so
like I'm not even that mad that I didn't
do it on camera I can recreate it very
very easily I'm gonna be taking my mani
anyway and makeup geek palette today
look at this little bastard as a little
oh good actually looks tore the
 up because Mom was abused you I'm
using this palette today because I told
you guys I was gonna try to incorporate
this palette as much as I can and
tutorials for those of you guys who did
get it and for those you guys who want
to get it you guys can definitely create
so many different looks with this
palette which is why I want to do as
many as I possibly can but that makes
sense we're gonna go in with beaches and
cream so nice just baiji transition
color absolutely love this color so much
I'm gonna put that into the lid with the
morphe 27 brush so next hour we're gonna
take a scrap pay which is a nice
beautiful maple brown tone on a morpheme
four three three that's going to go on
the outer corner of our eye very much
only on the outer corner and no powder
third of the eye as well it's just kind
of kind of trick the eye to give us more
of an uplifted look on the outer corner
when we do shadows out here so that's
what we're doing
I'm just running it out here not going
too far in and then blending out with ie
27 just to make sure there's no harsh
lines and edges you guys this look is so
simple but that's kind of what I wanted
it to be I want to be a nice pretty
simple everyday look that you can do in
your sleep basically so next
thing is we're gonna go in with the
morphe 32 and hard to miss shadow it's a
really pretty yellowish champagne shade
and that's gonna go all over the lid as
our really pretty bright and intense lid
color luckily because it does have that
nice gold undertone it's gonna look so
nice on so many different tones even if
you're darker in complexion it will look
like a beautiful shimmering highlight
color then taking that same in four
three three with no additional product
blending out the edges of Artemis just
to make sure there's no harsh lines and
that is it for the top of the eye super
easy super simple just a pretty natural
glow EULA and then taking a more freaky
36 brush and mixing it with peaches and
cream and Sora that's gonna be ran
underneath the lower lash line just to
give me a little bit of definition on
the lower lash line I don't like it when
it's completely bare I just think I look
really weird when I don't put a little
bit of something down there I don't know
I'm just like really weird about that
are any of you guys worried about that
like you guys have to put shadows on the
lower lash line or is that just me
because I really I do I don't know why I
just do and then we're gonna take a
little bit more of Artemis and that's
going to go on the brow bone to make
sure we have a nice glowy effect like I
was saying earlier and on the inner
corner of course I already technically
curled these left with Ampat mascara on
them so if they look wonky as
hell I'm sorry about it because I had to
wipe off the makeup I did the benefit
roller lash on the top and I did Mac
extended by Google black lash on the
bottom but also one more thing I forgot
to do on this eye that I already on this
eye I took the new aqua XLI pencil by
Omega forever
they did a collab with Charli XCX I
think that's her name and I'm gonna take
the yellow shade I'm gonna put that on
the lower lash line on the lower
waterline yellow is a brightening color
it's a very very illuminating and
awakening' color so I'm very intrigued
by doing a yellow pencil on the
waterline I kind of like it so that's it
for the eye look I really think it's
absolutely stunning you guys can keep it
at this and be good to go but it's not a
manual wait tutorial without some lashes
so I'm gonna put on a pair of lashes
really quickly and I'll be right and
once you put on a pair of Serengeti
lashes binding on some this is what the
look should look like I absolutely love
these lashes let me go ahead and zoom
you guys in to see with the eyes will
click up close
great so now that we have the face
completely done and the eyes are already
done as well I'm gonna go ahead and do
it the lips now I'm gonna do it just
nice very pretty natural lit I'm gonna
take the NYX peekaboo neutral lip liner
I think it's definitely time for me to
get a new one yeah just such a good lip
liner like good everyday lip liner
freakin $3.00 at the drugstore just so
good and if it lipstick I'm gonna be
going in with the rimmel london kate
lipstick in the shade 42 I've never
tried this before but it looks beautiful
and I saw and I was like this nude color
it looks stunning let's try it out Oh
bitch they smell good they're just a
really beautiful like creamy finish
lipstick I think this is stunning
holy I'm there in bed good
lipsticks I might want to do a little
bit of a gloss my well I'm taking the
Marc Jacobs gloss in the shade French
tickler and this is the final look and
that is it for the entire video I hope
you guys enjoy today's video had so much
fun creating this for you guys I love
doing a natural glam you know I'm into
doing like full-blown full coverage like
winged out insaneness but I'm also
