look ahead boys on right now it's a
super fresh super everyday just super
easy look to do especially for the
on-the-go woman who needs only like 10
minutes to do it look is the look that
you're gonna go for no lashes I would
loo just wear this out just to go like
to a lunch or something like that like
just if I want to do a little bit of
something to make it look like I care
about myself where I like taking myself
seriously this is what I would do
nothing to having nothing to glam just a
very everyday look you guys know me I
love my smokey eyes my fucking crazy ass
like intense eyes but you know I wanted
to do a little bit something different
for you guys just a nice fresh everyday
look so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video I hope it's not too boring for you
guys because this is more on the chill
side and you guys know I like much drama

bitch a thumbs up run down there click
on which fir'aun's loop yeah let's go
and get start to this video I hope you
guys like it and enjoy bye guys okay
cool so today's video is going to be a
full face video I'm gonna be completely
barren I have nothing on my face right
now I only have I've only like washed my
face and I have moisturizer on okay so
it's going just get this bad bitch
started I'm gonna start with primer
first when you're doing like a natural
makeup I mean for me I want my makeup to
last all day even if it's natural I want
to last all day from start to finish I
want it to be exactly how it is from
when I do the house to the end of the
day when I'm coming in today I'm gonna
use a Too Faced to hangover RX
replenishing face primer I've only used
just once before and I really liked it
the one time I used it so I'm just gonna
turn it again
see what I think I love the way it feels
feels like lotion it gives you like a
nice lotion feel like it smells like
coconut
oh my god it smells like pina colada I
smell literally like pina colada
I'm putting on the center of my face
like collards I'm just kind of pressing
it in around my face so now that I'm
primed and ready to go I'm not gonna go
to a concealer first I'm gonna go ahead
and conceal I'm taking my Urban Decay
Naked wait this concealer and the shade
light neutro so today the reason why you
can see that first is because I wanna
get the areas that I want to be the most
covered because today is more of a
natural look I really want to just kind
of be like spa treating rather than
being so heavy-handed
same with my acne like on my forehead or
this bitch up there is really trying me
any little areas that couldn't get rid
of the day
hmmm like that so now I have my little
concealer on and going with my damp Real
Techniques Beauty Blender dupe which I
am seriously in love with I'm gonna kind
of press that in the under eye area just
gotta help absorb any of the excess
concealer that I don't need there
because again this is a more natural
look I don't want it to be like
highlighted crazy under-eye concealing
madness going on like that's not what I
want I want it to be natural I want to
be weightless I wanted to look super
natural and look like I'm not really
wearing any makeup but then the day we
all know I yeah yeah if you feel like
you need more concealer to cover up your
dark circles by all means just layer it
up well I'm actually gonna go and take
the Urban Decay primer and use it on my
lids as my base is like primer whatever
I'm doing like a natural makeup honestly
like I don't really ever like prime my
eyes with primer I just use concealer
because it's just like easy I mean it
works for the most part I have really
greasy lids so sometimes it won't work
but for the most part it will the good
thing about using concealer as primer as
well as that helps conceal any of the
like redness or extra bein in you might
have it was our advantage that's the
grossest word I've ever said you know no
no no no no no so that were concealed in
the areas I wanted to conceal I'm going
to take my morphe and for 3/8 I'm going
to take a little bit of the laura
mercier brightening powder on the back
of the photo cap take a very tiny amount
actually not taking a lot like I usually
do I'm just taking a very little amount
dusting it off and I'm really just gonna
press it over the concealer only really
focusing it on the concealer not going
too low with this because I'm going to
be putting on foundation and set the
eyelids as well so they don't crease now
I'm going to go and take a one pump of
the Make Up For Ever HD altra HD
foundation this is the newest one that
they just launched I'm in the shade 140
140 image a 140 like the coloring scheme
confuses me so I'm going that only on
this don't take a little bit on here now
I'm going to press that into the cheeks
of my face anywhere else on the cheeks
oh I know where all the tubes are I'm
gonna take a look down the sponge and
I'm just going to press that in the
areas I think that I need a little bit
more coverage but for example I want it
to be a little bit more right here the
cheeks a little bit of my nose a little
bit of the forehead and that's about it
so I'm gonna take it there and the
reason I'm using a sponge with this is
because I feel like it's going to help
deposit less product that's kind of what
I want I want this look to be more an
undetectable natural everyday foundation
routine
around the mouth a little bit if you get
redness around the mouth some of the
nose of course on the center of the
forehead except I have the most acne is
on the center of the forehead with
plenty and then whatever I have left on
the sponge I kind of press it around
everywhere else just very lightly
nothing too intense a very light layer
and the face should look something like
this it's nice and fresh looking it's
not too flat the faces in flat
whatsoever
I feel like this the ultra HD foundation
gives you a matte finish but it has a
slight sheen so I could Demi matte
finish not too flat but not too glow
it's not a glowy foundation whatsoever
and I honestly like I love it I've used
it like four times now and I have been
going back to it so now to set the face
clean use at the face I'm going to go in
with my morphe eg0 which I talked about
this several times one of my favorite
brushes of all time for powder because
it's very thick and it picks up a lot of
product not only is it really thick and
dense but it's so fluffy
it's like full proof gzo is foolproof
and so I'm gonna take my g0 with my Mac
medium mineralized skinfinish also I've
talked about before on my channel great
setting powder just just give you a
natural Sheen again I was gonna press
that over the face cuz I'm gonna give
you much coverage or anything like that
it's just going to set the foundation
but still give you that skin like
appearance which is what I want to go
for today and then I'm gonna take it
down my neck a little bit too just to
match my face slightly okay great so now
the face is powdered and ready to go
this is a set foundation base I feel
like the skin looks really nice it
doesn't look too heavy but it's still
like breathable I don't feel like I'm
wearing on a foundation I can definitely
a moat and I'm totally good to go you
know
so don't trip so now we're gonna go in
bronze the face I think what I'm doing a
natural look I always bronze I always
bronze no matter whatever say the
bronzer hoola by benefit on my morphe to
hopefully use our backing stomach I hope
so I was gonna run that in the halls in
my face there's any spot where I wish
that I liked it like the Sun was hitting
it and giving more me more of a
sunkissed glow on the temples into the
hairline and even in the middle just
give me some color and dimension back to
the skin because I feel like when you're
just wearing foundation only it's so
flat I just think honestly like wearing
foundation by itself looks super weird
that's just me that's just personal
preference I really like hula because I
feel like it's very neutral I don't feel
like it's ever too orange on me and I
don't feel like it
to cool-toned on me I just feel like
it's a really pretty natural bronzer
rubbing it on my chin a little bit and
I'm not contouring today because
obviously like like what natural look is
contoured be honest I'm not gonna wear
any blush today I just want to do a
little bit highlighting a bronzing
because I don't wanna bring too much
attention to the cheeks giving me some
dimension to the skin okay so I'm gonna
go and take champagne pop by Becca and
Jacqueline hmm on my morphe dem 501 and
I'm just gonna dust that on the cheeks
on the highest planes of the cheeks
actually not too much because I don't
want it to be too intense I want to look
more like a global from within rather
than being super highlighted with this
kinda look I feel like the face just
looks like it has dimension and I feel
like I'm breaking out my features and
the best way possible and I feel like it
doesn't it doesn't look heavy it doesn't
feel heavy at least it doesn't look
heavy in the mirror right now that I'm
looking at this one caddy hopefully
doesn't look too heavy on the camera but
I think it looks really pretty really
natural and it's going to one to the
eyes now so for the brows I'm not gonna
do much at all I'm just gonna take a
little mini brow gel the Gimme brow by
benefit in the shade medium deep I'm
just going to lightly comb this through
the brow hair I really just love the
Gimme brow because I feel like it's not
too heavy of a formula it's really
lightweight keeps my brows in place and
it deposits the right amount of color so
this is great for a natural look we just
want to kind of toss something to your
brow don't you feel I didn't with the
pencil or anything like that just toss
in some brow gel and you Gardea see the
difference between this Brown this brow
this will look so much more filled in
and so much more clean in this one just
kind of like going on over there you
know okay great so the brows are filled
in it's just a really easy natural light
fill and now let's do move on to the
eyes and as you know we already primed
the eyes with the concealer so I'm gonna
go and take the morphe 35o palette I'm
really excited I just got this in the
mail and I looked at it and I dot oh my
sweet lord baby Jesus I need to use this
because this is so me you guys know like
I love those warm orange edy brown tones
and I'm like hi hi 35 0 and mani makes
meet you this is me and I love it and I
just wanted to use this really bad ok so
first things first we're going to go and
combine these two colors right here on
the same brush I'm going to be using a
27 I was gonna kind of run that in there
it's almost gonna look like peach
smoothie like by makeup geek again feel
oh yes I'm dying and I love it and this
is death I don't want to I don't wanna
come back I'm just tossing that into my
crease because I want to have dimension
in the crease I don't wanna have too
much going on papi see I don't have a
lot of color going on I just want into
men
Chinn for my eyes like we did to the
Facebook bronze and we highlighted the
face I want to the exact same thing to
the eye
honestly the more few shadows are so
impressive to me whenever I use a
palette by morphic I'm like oh my God
why don't I use these more like I'm just
always impressed you know especially
this certified zero of like I'm so
impressed
also my mani mu a code for morphe you
can use them on the palettes to like
it's not just the brushes you can use on
anything from morphe so use the win
against the use away so I'm gonna go and
mix these two colors right here these
two right here and I'm gonna use that as
my brow bone highlight on a more feet 14
just a nice a flat shader brush Oh hmm
that has like a light shimmer to it and
then I'm gonna go in with a morphe m-43
three and I'm gonna take the shade I'm
gonna take this shade right here this
like neutral somewhat warm Brown and I'm
just gonna take that into the crease
with that m43 just give me a little bit
more dimension mmm mm-hmm
that's so pretty I just feel like it's
great I just keep look at that dimension
you guys look at that shit that is some
good shit right there so we have a nice
contoured I just kind of contoured right
there and then I'm gonna go and take
sink is really pretty shimmery color yes
son so I'm gonna go and take this third
color right here in the palette it's
this one worth day on my finger just a
light layer of that on my lid this is
like a nice champagne tone just to give
me a nice like highlighted lid look and
then between each step I'll kind of
blend in with that I'm four three three
with no additional product so she looks
like this super fucking easy I'm just
gonna do the bottom of the eye right now
we're here you know we're here we're
here I'm going to take the e36 by morphe
and then I'm going to take this shade
and just run that underneath my eye very
lightly on the outer corner depositing
on the outer corner only and then
running it forward after there's not
much product on the brush left I'm
taking that same original champagne
color right there and I'm gonna put that
on my team morphe brush backing it off
and then put that in the inner corner to
help brighten the eye like that feel
free to freakin pack that bitch and like
pack it all on if you want to pack that
bitch on pack it on you know basically
that's all I'm gonna do for the eye I
feel like it's so easy it just contoured
my eye really nicely I feel like it gave
me dimension to the crease made my lid
pop out a little bit more and I just
feel like that's a really pretty easy
look I'm gonna go finish this eye off
camera real quick and I'll be right back
okay great so now both eyes are done and
I also curled my lashes off camera cuz I
just feel like you know it's curl
the lash I don't need to say you that
I'm going to take my favorite mascara of
the moment it is the benefit roller lash
mascara going from the base of the root
huh
it goes so now that we have one little
coat of mascara on I feel like my lashes
are listening like what the fuck's going
on you never wear just mascara you
always wear last year's and I'm like
it's true and I feel like they look so
weird with just like mascara on but you
know what this is natural look that's
what we're going to do and lashes aren't
as natural what we're gonna do is we're
going to line the inner rim of my
waterline with the Inglot called number
five pencil which is basically a nude
liner for the waterline cool kind of
open up the eye a little bit without it
being like a white pencil it's going to
be a nude pencil where it's a little
more beige and a little more natural
looking and then I'm gonna take the
extended play gigablack mascara for the
bottom lashes this is an excessive step
you can definitely use the top mascara
on your bottom mascara but it's just
what I'm gonna do because I like the way
the extended play looks on my bottom
lashes awesome so the top and bottom
mascara is on I just feel like my eyes
look a little bit more open now they
still really natural they still look
very fresh and a weight but not so heavy
okay so now I'm gonna go into my lips
I'm not gonna line right now cuz I feel
like I just don't feel like it I'm gonna
take these Charlotte Tilbury lipstick in
Miss Kensington which looks like pings
it's like a beautiful like natural pink
but I'm like this
oh that's so pretty and then on top of
that I'm gonna go and take the fresh
sugar nude sugar what the fuck are you
the fresh sugar new shine lip treatment
which is basically like a nude gloss but
it's a lip treatment at the same time
you guys know I love fresh fresh is such
a beautiful beautiful company idea great
products gonna go and tell us a little
bit of that on the center my lips it's a
really pretty nude color but it's so
freakin lightweight because it is a
litte treatment it's not like a lip
gloss but it does give you that nice
little sheen that a lip gloss would give
you and yeah
that's it for the final look this is
such an easy everyday simple look to do
doesn't take any time at all honestly it
really is just like so like buh-buh-buh
couple steps you're good to go done easy
Haseley is it prison lemon squeezy
