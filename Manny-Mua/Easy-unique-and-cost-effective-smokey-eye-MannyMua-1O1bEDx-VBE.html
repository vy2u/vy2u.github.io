a quick how-to video on how to do the
smoky eye that I did I'm kind of over
the whole like let's do Browns and
blacks and that's not it and let's go
out I want to do something more fun and
then like bold you know get some like
golds up in there get some glitter
flakes get some now we're not
even saying right now so yeah um yeah so
if you guys want to see this look how
she did this I look I didn't do my brows
in this video I didn't do my lips and I
didn't do my face
um if you want to see this eye look that
I did stay tuned and I hope you guys
like it
subscribe to me Dean okay first things
first we're going to put down some loose
powder just to catch any ball that we
might have just one of those old drag
tricks that I like to do you now we're
going to prime our eyes obviously we
need primer to keep our Machado's on a
lot longer I like to tell clients uh
primers are basically magnets for makeup
they allow shadows to stay true to color
and not crease etc etc you guys know the
deal Pat - it on like it's your job and
let it melt into your skin do not apply
a shadow when the primer is still wet
let it dry first I promise it will help
look into the camera like you're
gorgeous but you are anything now we're
gonna go in with peaches and cream
something that that's like peaches
something from makeup geek and we're
going to go all over the lid with that
right up to our brow but know what's the
fun on our problems we're going right up
to our crease okay lid and crease with
that whole shadow everywhere
let them creating now we're going to go
in with Coco Bader and that's just going
to go basically all over our entire we
know it's not one light and saying is
the first I'm recording this is so weird
I don't like it
actually I do but I think it used to so
that's gonna be on our outer third of
our eye now we're going to blend blend
blend go in what then I feel like 217
type style brush we're gonna blend into
our crease so closer I'm getting towards
the inner corner of our eye Eli are the
strokes I'm doing so yeah now I've got
filming no I'm playing
blending still cool I told actually put
this clip in there because I noticed
that one I was completely awesome the
other one that one was a lot higher than
the last one and so what do you really
want to do is just kind of take a step
back and you're like whoa I'm see the
shadows are they turned out good but I
need to go back in with more and blend
higher and that's what I did now we're
going in with a really small Real
Techniques brush and we're just pleased
to see vignette on the outer third of
our eye just to give us a definition in
that day I'm actually kind of carving
out my I like the crease of my tire
almost like a cook beef just to kind of
separate my lid from the cocoa bear
eyeshadow with that black that black is
blacker than my night sky
enchilada now we're going with that
brush that we just used earlier or sort
of blending circular motions key
blending blending is key to this look
with any basically any slow guy and
blending blending fulfill
okay
Jenny's a loved one so bunny girl I'm
still blaming cool see if it's
symmetrical see it's what you like you
do like it
keep going next step film gel liner so
we're gonna go in just with my finger I
went in with my finger I really don't
care we're going to apply the most gel
liner towards what our lashes are
because I like it when its darkest by my
lashes we're just going to kind of
feather our finger upwards that makes
them we're just going to blend with our
finger the gel liner into the black
shadow that we cut our crease with
originally and that's why it's giving us
that nice fade gradient darkest by the
lashes now we're gonna go back in with
Coco bear right on top of that gel liner
just to make it really pretty it looks
like some milk and dark chocolate mixed
together you know I love my chocolate I
really do yeah blender head
growl actually year
actually kind of up on that side
so I just wanted to show you guys that
it really doesn't matter we're gonna go
in with a pigment on top of it anyway so
it's all good if you mess up keep going
I went back in with corrupt shadow and I
went all over the brown because I kind
of wanted to be darker so I went a
little bit lower than the cocoa bear
just make it a little deeper
now the fun part we're going in with
this pigment it's a fix+ spread your
brush spray that you'll be buying
and I forgot to film it actually no I
did but I was out of focus completely so
I went in and just wanted to show you
guys I'm going with utopia take me if I
make a scene this really gorgeous gold
like flaky mist that's why we put that
powder down first because there's a lot
of fallout with this pigment like I've
never not used it whether was it a
shit-ton the fallout so and that's not
what you doing getting that big hairy
brush wipe away all that loose powder
and it kind of acts as a highlight to
it's kind of soaking into our skin so I
like it boom all that wiped away
now I can go in with shadow on the
bottom of our eye I always make weird
faces when I do it I just can't help it
you just do that look you just look like
a dumbass it's fine now we're going with
some mascara and some liner and that's
the lid
look at that oh really
check
no one liked that stinking I'm just
needed better lunges they know what a
stinking chance Oh
my eyes are watering a flake a Flay got
in there a plate he got in my eye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
