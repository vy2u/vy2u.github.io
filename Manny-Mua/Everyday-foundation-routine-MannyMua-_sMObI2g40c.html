dammit oh so I'm making this video today
because I want to do it like quick
how-to hi to my foundation I get a lot
of questions on Instagram of what I use
and how I do it and things like that so
I'm just gonna make a video of how I do
my foundation routine cool cool let's
get into it yeah gonna do first I'm
gonna use a moisturizer I was going to
talk to this one hopefully it's not
blurry or buzzy into like that thumb
it's cool
getting moisturizer going side on my
face going outward like to start with
the looks of the moisturizer in the
center Pat assured it like you pat your
weave like that what I'm using is some
first aid Beauty which is really good
she voiced razor that I got support when
I work there so good job first aid okay
she now I'm going to go in with a little
bit of a primer a little bit of printed
on effect I'm okay like to do with
primaries I just kind of put like a
little bit i dot it where I want the
most so you can kind of see those ladies
splotches and like that so then
I'll just going to go in and smooth it
over
starting from the center going outwards
I usually need the most help in this
like the t-zone area
I get oily there after the long acid
days I have a work or dealing with these
hos dealing with hoes making me
sweaty Excel melted into the skin do we
have a nice just pretty base this one
I'm using is called miracle skin it's
probably the best primer I've ever used
in my entire life um it has a
little bit of coverage to it it's a
silicone primer so it keeps you mat
throughout the day and it's probably the
only one besides the map one that has
ketamine bat throughout like at least
six hours pass because I'm pretty oily
in the t-zone so only going in Marc
Jacobs marvelous mousse I got it from my
work when I worked at Sephora so I've
decided that I can love it and I think
it all the time I'm you blowing with the
Real Techniques buffing brush same thing
to zone outwards
I need the most help and that tease
little girl
covergirl uncovered boy so I need to use
mark Jacob mm-hmm just dad that in
there buff it in I love this brush like
to death why my favorite brush I've ever
had for foundation so far at least same
thing on the other side it's with the
most like I have gnarly pores though you
guys something understand my pores are
like pools of death like if you look
into them you'll probably fall in like
they're really bad and they're really
nasty so I try to really buff that
like my foundation into my pork it's
probably bad for my board but if I look
pretty who gives a do what I say
which I get the desired coverage at womp
this foundation is a cream as you guys
can see I took a cream to powder
foundation it dries matte but I still
like to go over with powders and conquer
what anything says I'm always gonna put
a powder on top of it like I'm sorry but
it just works for me it's cool it's got
that nice nice base nice pretty base now
I'm going to go in with Mac Pro Longwear
and w20 can see you that because I
 love concealer in my honor I
just really no I just like that
highlighted look so I'm gonna go for it
 dense concealer brush from ELF
it's actually one my favorite bushes
I've ever purchased from elf in my whole
life or even brushes in general it
really really really works they're
really acts like a little finger it says
this my pinky got turned into a brush
that's what they say is it's my pinky in
a brush you ready
look I my family is so loud I'm trying
to get video they're like reconstruction
and chin a little on my hand
go right up to the lashline I like to go
into my inner corner as well some of my
some of the darkness my under-eye area
will hide in the outer corner or the
inner corner with my saying the outer
corner and I hate that I hate that
 when you have like it's concealed
beautifully down here and you get this
 black ass thing down there
that's what are you trying to do that's
not the little girl it's not over going
for whatever I have left over I'll just
kind of brush it onto my lids done cool
I think it's ready priority already cool
now we're gonna go in I keep saying cool
I don't know I'm saying cool so
much like this is my first like attempt
YouTube face ish and I realized that I
have the worst lingo in the world if I'm
not saying cool I'm probably cussing so
I'd rather just say cold in the
word than the word then the
marred rather say cool than so I'm
trying to do okay
I'll bear with me now I'm gonna go in
with my trusty Oh mmm Holy Grail powder
is the airspun
cote Aires button original formula big
fluffy brush pat it in putting the most
of the powder on the outer parts of my
face actually and just going upwards
just setting we're just kind of setting
the foundation trying to avoid the
under-eye area as much as I can so when
you through some powder fright I
probably look some light
compared to like what it really looks
like everybody looks really pretty in
the picture and like the mirror better I
don't know what it looks like in there
it could look ugly
I don't know cool there's a cool again I
probably gonna count the cools mmm
now I'm gonna go in but my honest or
Talent
oh hi it's so good lucky with my Real
Techniques setting brush
mmm and it's pink I was a pastor shape
underneath my eye you know like what
Kincaid has that whole highlighting from
the under eye with a banana powder from
midnight this is like that but like it's
a moustache yes I was prettier and
 better honestly hello anastacio
she's just died had died for her I would
die for her probably I'm sure I would
hmm now I'm gonna go in with this woman
here has a little bit of shimmer in it
I'm actually gonna put that on the on my
cheek oh look at that your addictions
hmm longing like this one gives you like
a silver pink iridescent to it I'm
usually a fan of gold
iridescent but this one I just I really
like it I'm brush it off close it tell
we need it next time now I'm gonna go
with some bronzer I'm actually gonna be
using the Marc Jacobs foundation powder
in 360 I got it from work then work
these guys okay guys I'm not I'm not I'm
 cheap like I'm not I don't have
a lot of money so these guys I have the
marching so it's from work I got for
free like I got out for free so I'm
gonna let you thing it's just a little
bit little bit darker than my skin tone
somebody's as my bronzer those are gonna
go in
so here what I have to tell people from
the top of your ear down to your mouth
is where you want to start we're gonna
go in with the contour color later right
now we're just going in giving us some
warm get that warmth we're not cold
bitches so we need to get some more
planning I'll do on the temples as well
cuz I'm a boy and I want to look really
pretty I'm really rough like I'm so
rough on myself
I'm not rough like this on clients I
don't think I'm looking for something
friend mmm warmth a minute now I'm gonna
go back in with Anasazi palette again
little tapered II round bottle brush so
it's called the small contour it's from
Sephora I got in a huge kit because it
was on sale for like 16 bucks plus my
discount off the time with like 12 bugs
for like seven brushes bugging me around
there not too much brushes they're
really not but first for 12 bucks I'll
buy one
I'll go closely I'm gonna go in
heavy-handed clearly okay you guys
seriously this is so pigmented and brush
it upwards with my bronzer I like to
kind of brush up because it kind of
blends in into my cheekbone I think
that's what actually really gives you
like that lifted feeling is if you're
brushing it and buffing it up rather
than down so try when you're doing your
bronzer next time or your contour carve
in and buff up okay make that face that
you make with bouncer carve that
cheek out Beach carve that cheek oh yeah
look at that
let's be right there same thing when you
on the forehead hope you go back and
about this fluffy brush left a
I don't wanna harsh lines even though
it's a contour rather than a bronze the
second time I don't want any harsh lines
anyway oh my god I almost forgot the
brows what I doing my brows everything
well every time I go to work so what I
do small small small brush this is the
detailer brush by Real Techniques the
Wayne with my trusty Mac Pro concealer
palette I'm NW 15 and what I do is I'm
sneaky at little region that is I
highlight under eyebrow bone with this
color you see me all the way to the
front really carving out the brow I'll
put a bunch up to where my hair is and
I'm gonna go in with my finger blend it
out and it automatically gives you a
higher brow I promise you guys you guys
probably can't see it that well but I
don't do anything else in my brows when
I'm just normally working every single
day every day but when I go to work I
just do this and people ask me all the
time what I have in my brows which isn't
that I just have concealer underneath
blowing with some fix+
that's so this is my everyday look any
picture you singing my introduces the
look I have going maybe the highlighter
is different the highlights the only
thing I really change for everything
else is exactly the same and the
foundation has changed too
I'll change it to Mac ones or NARS so I
guess there's beautiful oh but I'm
just going to go with this one today
because I don't like it so that's it um
let me know if you guys like this we
like these kind of tutorial II type chat
with me type walk you through my
step-by-step routine like deal ish
try to my lips too right now
sure okay I'll do them I really
well I'm not gonna get a lip line right
now I'll do like a lip I'll do like a
lip tutorial right now I'm just gonna do
this turn going with and chanted one
and if this on Mac it's a matte formula
and it was in there a learning alcoholic
line basically honey love like it's
straight up almost exactly the same as
honey love that lipstick so I always say
that it's honey let that work because it
is and then sometimes if I'm feeling
like I wanted to go a little bit later
I'll grab flashback or me will go with
me
toss in mitt on the center and that's it
and that's why foundation routine they
don't get my glasses and this is my work
