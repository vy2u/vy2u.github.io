today's video is going to be my February
favorites and disappointments I don't
have a lot of either actually I have not
been trying a lot of products in
February I don't know why I just didn't
I
I've just been traveling a lot and I've
been super super busy so whenever I'm
traveling I tend to not really try new
makeup because I get so anxious I'm like
dude I have what I have and I know that
I love it so why would I try to like use
something that I don't think I'm going
to love or I don't I don't know you know
what I mean so whenever I'm traveling
I'm always like I'm not trying me I'm
bugging and hearing you but I do have a
lot of products that you absolutely love
in this video and I just love doing
various videos you guys know this
parrots videos are some of my favorite
videos to film because they're just so
fun and I love to just sit back and
chitchat to you guys and just talk to
you guys about products I've been loving
in products I have not been loving so
much as well that's like more a recent
thing I just started doing that in
January and the first video went over so
freaking well I mean I don't know if
it's because sale was in the thumbnail
probably she was in the thumbnail but um
the first video went over so well and
you guys were really appreciative of me
talking about products I don't really
love as much so I'm gonna try to
continue on the tradition if I have
things during the month I don't really
like I'll talk about them you know I
mean just so you guys can see what I
have not been really loving absolutely
living for this past month but yeah
let's go and get started on today's
favourites and disappointments as always
if you like this video if you guys don't
like me please don't watch it
you know the drill with that you know Jo
with that if you don't like me don't
watch this video there's literally no
point
I'm not everyone's cup of tea but you
don't need to watch it and you don't
need a comment negative things towards
me okay but if you guys do like this
video please subscribe to my channel if
you want already and if you knew what's
up I'm a anyway and welcome to my
channel thank you so much for being here
but let's go and get started on this a
mother truck in video I'm excited for
the disappointments of favorites
laverna talk about something from
skincare of course you guys know if I
have a skincare item that I've been
loving that I'll talk about it first
because it's just easier that way for me
the first thing I want talk about really
quickly and only skincare item I have is
the good jeans by Sunday Riley this is a
serum that they do you guys just like
want to scream with how freaking good
this is this is a all-in-one lactic acid
of treatment it brightens exfoliates
plumps lines reduces appearance of
hyperpigmentation and instantly boosts
and radiates skin so I completely agree
with every single claim that it has on
this it is such a brightening beautiful
line filling serum I use it literally
every single night this is my second
bottle and I'm almost done with it
completely and it's expensive so I'm
like bug-like it's an expensive ass
product but I know that it really does
work so I'm not like pissed to buy it
again I'm kind of like uh like
frustrated to buy it again because it's
like expensive but when a skincare
vitamin works for me I'm like great I
feel like it's an investment and I don't
really care that it's like an expensive
product or something I have to buy again
because I feel like it's working for me
to make my skin look a little bit
younger and more plump I will totally go
for and that's totally fine with me
honestly I just noticed that this really
helps with my smile lines my smile lines
are like the worst lines on my face
other than of course my under eyes and
things like that but when it comes to
like insecurities with lines on my face
it's deafening my smile lines and since
I ever started using this I've noticed
that they have just diminished a lot
like nothing of my routine changed other
than adding a serum to it from Sunday
Riley because I love the other products
and I noticed that the lines and the
pores and everything on my face has
diminished over the last couple of
months
by using this I've gotta talk about this
couple about whatever talk about it now
honestly amazing if you're looking for a
good ass serum for night time just like
put on your face and you wake up and you
just feel like your skin has just been
rejuvenated I would check out the good
jeans by Sunday Riley it's so amazing
I'm literally going out to buy another
one soon that's like halfway done second
favorite I've been loving this past
month have been sensual beauty lenses by
desi oh these are on this style innocent
why I'm not wearing them right now by
worn them in a couple photos this month
actually I've been really just like
these lenses so much like I feel like
for some reason like when you're using
this like really intense icy contact it
gives you like the most intense ass-like
appearance to a photo I guess you slept
like a pop to your photo and it gives
you a pop to your makeup I don't know
why that is but when you have piercing
ass blue like bright eyes it makes your
makeup up even more and I do
standed I don't understand everyone
always asked me all the time what
context I'm wearing on snapchat or if
I'm going to Nevada I'm wearing and I
just popped in some contacts I'm wearing
the desi Oh innocent white contacts
they're absolutely amazing under a
three-month contact so I can wear a pair
of these in the last week three months
like if you take everything last year
three months and I absolutely love them
I literally have them in my travel case
with me at all times because they're
just so beautiful in the shade innocent
white I just like how they make my eyes
look my eyes naturally are hazel kind of
adding that white in front gives a
really cool intense like a bluish hue
and I just I really love that so desi Oh
innocent white contacts I mean next
product I won't talk about is a
drugstore product which I oh my god have
two different products in here three mmm
three cheaper alternatives the first
structure item I wanna talk about is the
Maybelline master fix loose setting
powder this is the white one I use this
in my Maybelline full face get ready
with me and honestly guys I was social
and I've used there a couple times after
that only for filming I use it when I'm
filming something I'm not using it for
like flash photography because this is a
silica based powder it's like very
similar to the Make Up For Ever HD loose
powder where it gives you like that blur
appearance it's very very beautiful you
just look smooth all over the skin I
absolutely love it however you need to
careful with flash photography because
silica is very very intense but honestly
this is such a great ass dupe for the
makeup forever one and it's from
freaking Maybelline so honestly if you
guys can check out the Maybelline master
fix loose setting powder it's in the
shade translucent I think any skin tone
can wear this just be a little bit more
careful when it comes to darker
complexions because of the white silica
can can stick to patches so how deadly
dust it off with a foundation powder or
a colored powder of some type but
honestly if you guys are looking for a
nice ask HD powder that looks literally
blurred on the skin that's
amazing that's not gonna break the bank
like they make it for everyone not that
it does as bad just check out the
Maybelline master fix loose setting
powder it's so so good two brushes I
wanna talk about really quickly just a
brief moment because I try to go quickly
when it comes to brushes talking about
in a favorites video because a lot
people always like man you again you
love brushes and I'm like ain't
no these are too by morphe and I talked
about these before in the past but
they've just been like lifesavers for me
in this past month even more so this
brush is the morphe y6 it's a dense
kabuki packing brush I'm a full coverage
kind of girl I love me some coverage
full
coverage Kunti so the y6 really just
allows me to have as much fullest
coverage as I possibly can without
breaking the bank I think it's like 10
to 15 dollars for this brush and I know
of other brushes that are compact
intense like this they're like 30 to 40
so I just feel like morphe brushes you
just save money man you just save good
amount of money and you guys know I'm a
one for the affiliate you can use a code
man you wait in store online
I love morphe products and I know a lot
of times people are always like oh my
god you push more fees so hard
like stop talking with morphe and it's
like why if I can avoid doing
sponsorships for example if I can get
paid from affiliates and things that I
love and avoid doing sponsorships at all
costs and try to do sponsorships like
once every like four months like live my
life then why don't I do that why would
I not use things like I constantly love
all the time and promote those rather
than doing like a one-off sponsorship
like I'm not gonna do that that's just
my own rationale behind it and I was
just wanted to quickly talk about that
morphe m42 one this brush it does it all
that's why I love it so much I use it
for underneath my brows use for the top
of my brows I used to clean up my
concealer I use it to pack on some
shadow I use it for glitter glue I use
it for glitter packing it's just a
multi-purpose brush and you really I
used to cut out my crease if I'm doing a
cut crease this brush just does it all
and it's absolutely amazing if you're
looking for a small detail brush that
can really look at that look at that
brush like look at that you see that you
see that absolutely amazing and I
can suggest you any like detail brush
that can like really multi-purpose check
out the morphe m4 to one it's like four
dollars five dollars I don't know but
it's really inexpensive and it works
fantastically I have two more fake spots
don't talk about really quickly I have
been gagging dying gagging breathing
living breathing artists everything for
the Mac mineralize skinfinish in the
shade medium golden I'll put this all
over my face after I set my face with
translucent powder to give me more of a
color back to the skin this is a little
bit darker than my own complexion I
personally love to go darker with my
foundation I know a lot of people hate
that I know a lot people always like
mani match your neck to your
face and I'm always like like I
literally don't carry much I'm doing it
on purpose it's not like I'm like doing
it like oh my god like I'm so unmapped
it's like I really don't care I love
going a shade darker with my foundation
I took a bit more tan and not so pale
when I worked on back on like I remember
working at Mac and I would talk about
the powder all the time I don't remember
about it very much right now it's like I
know that it's like triple baked it
gives you the most beautiful a skin like
finish
and it's such a lightweight powder and
it's great for people that are dry oily
combination it literally gives you a
beautiful skin like finish on the skin
that's why it's called mineralized
skinfinish because it does have minerals
in it that make it give you a life like
appearance and it's a flat powder it's
like a life like powder if that makes
any sense this is I would say like a
light to medium coverage it's not a full
coverage powder by any means also this
is great for like younger girls if you
guys don't want to do like a
full face of masks
a foundation which is fine like it's
cool like Noah Vance here you can use a
mineralized skinfinish and it will just
give you a beautiful like light wash of
just ethereal perfection really ethereal
perfection and I won't talk about
highlighter really quickly that I've
been loving this month and it's so
freaking cool because it's an affordable
drugstore highlighter this is from the
brand pixie and this is actually a
collab with Aspen overed who is
literally one of the sweetest most kind
genuine people I've ever met I've hung
out with her a couple times and on
different brand trips that we've seen
each other so many times in passing in
and the beginning she's kind of like a
little more on the shy side she's more
reserved but she opened up to me and
she's literally like the sweetest most
down-to-earth cool ass girl and I love
Parker as well they're amazing and she
collab with pixie along with a lot of
other influencers and she created this
shade santorini sunset and this
highlighter guys is feels absolutely
amazing it's just such a beautiful ass
champagne and it's such a great
alternative to high-end highlights when
you can get this literally at the
drugstore a target with pixie like it's
such an affordable brand and I think
Aspen really just killed it with this
color the formula is beautiful the color
is absolutely beautiful the way it sits
on your skin is beautiful and I'm just
like dude I love when drugstore brands
like collaborate with influencers and
they create these beautiful products and
I'm just so proud of you I spin
congratulations working with Pixie and
congratulations pixie to with working
with Aspen I know she's absolutely
amazing and I'm sure what fantastically
can last two products that I've been
loving and these are for the eyes I
won't talk about this really quickly
because I've been loving it the past two
months and I completely forgot to put it
in last month's video and I was like
 me I need to put in the next one
this is the color pop gel liner pencil
in the shade overboard you guys this
pencil the most beautiful chocolate
metallic brown do it it reminds me a lot
of Mac coastal reach but five dollars
like this color is so beautiful and I
just noticed that this color really
brings out my hazel
and it makes it look a little bit more
green and I love that effect I would
definitely suggest if you guys are
looking for a nice ass a brown liner
that will really make your color ice pop
or even if you're wearing if you have
brown eyes it's still gonna make your
eyes pop it has like that really pretty
metallic glisten to it and it just
really gives your eyes a wowing
pop man like that pops like my
 pissy like it pops so I just
would suggest this it's absolutely
amazing and it's five dollars like you
really cannot be that with color pop and
these pencils stain the waterline all
day long they don't bleed on me and I'm
always just like how how the hell did
color pop do this where these pencils
like literally last a freaking lifetime
on your eyes without bleeding I don't
know how they did it for five bucks and
if you're little scared to wear black
eyeliner try popping in this metallic
Brown on your waterline just to see
there's a test the waters if you think
black is a little too harsh which I
totally understand but this is just such
a beautiful warm color and it really
just brings a lot of life to your eyes
it's just it's stunning I promise you I
think you'll really like it
last eye product on talked about really
quickly is what I'm wearing on my eyes
right now
this is the Stila magnificent metals
glitter and glow liquid eyeshadows my
favorite one personally is a shade
kitten karma it's what I'm wearing on my
eyes right now it's just a most
beautiful intense glittery ass shadow
like I'm like I live this is what it
looks like were here like bleh and it
stays there forever it's just such a
nice eye shadow it's absolutely
beautiful and I actually heard about
these last month when Jeffrey put it in
his favorites video and then Nick to
Torrance in her favorites video and then
Patrick told me person he's like dude
these are bomb and I'm like okay
well I guess I'm gonna I'm gonna
try them they're so easy it's like this
little paddle you put it over your eyes
you blend it on the the sides of the
crease and you're good and just gives
you a beautiful ass I look with ease
with easy breezy like I heard
though that you can't really use this
with eyeprimer specifically because it
will kind of flake off and fall onto
your lashes I heard that I don't really
know I've not used this with eyeprimer
yet I use it with a Mac Paint Pot and I
use it with concealer so I don't really
know exactly yet cuz like they worked on
me like there's no fallout like
everything looks great it stays on my
lid perfectly fine so I'm like I don't I
don't know where that came from I
haven't tried it with the primer just
yet I would suggest not using a primer
with this underneath your eyes like a
intense as primer because I'd like the
silicon and this like the way they just
mix it's not going to be the best and I
think that's what it was that's why I
primers are
the best for this kind of product but
check out the shade kitten karma I'd
really something you'll be disappointed
this is such a sick nasty shade like Sam
and now we'll be onto the
disappointments there are only two
disappointments in this video and
they're not bad ok ones like buggin bad
with other ones like another boat bad
like they're bad just get into it ok so
I wanna talk about this lipstick really
quickly by Mac this is in the shade - Oh
spice the new formulation that Mac just
came out with is absolutely amazing the
formula in the past and I wasn't really
a big fan I thought they dried out your
lips too much and I thought they
crumbled on the center a lot more than
they should and I was like yeah and I
kind of wrote off the lipsticks then
they came out with this new batch and I
was like uh like they're actually so
freaking nice and I was like oh these
feel absolutely amazing they stay on the
lips very nicely they don't feel
uncomfortable and I was like go Mac like
 yeah I do like they have nice ass
lipsticks now like the new like
lipsticks are beautiful but I tried on
this color and I looked sickly like
jaundice like I had jaundice always have
been talking about this is in a
disappointment it's because of the color
the formula is beautiful the color is
what gave me like I can't it's like a
muted baby pukey like orange a yellow
this color on me was just a scary sight
you know and I'm usually the type of
person that I'm like yeah bitch I can
pull off any color as long as you like
feel like you can pull it off as long as
you feel confident in it like I'm like
yes but you can work any color you want
to like that's just my philosophy in
life fake it till you make it you know
but this one I wore it although like I
took that off so so quick if you
guys like these kind of colors let me
know in the comments below if these are
the kind of work cause I work on you
like what kind of skin tone will these
work for I literally don't even know
like it's such a unique color this would
be a great as an eyeshadow like I think
as a shadow I would be like yes like
putting into my crease like living for
it but as a lip color I was like I just
looked like we I just looked weird weird
again the second product this one I
literally died with how like
shook I was with the reaction of this I
couldn't believe it so this is the elf
baked highlighter in the shade moonlight
pearls so when I open this a nice wash
down Michael Madden highlighter let's
sell freaking cool I haven't tried any
other highlighters before am i coming
that's so keep alternative to
highlighters that's amazing and it looks
so pretty in the pan it looks like the
surface of the Moon and so I was like oh
my god so cool and i swatched it
I know with a lot of times with baked
powders you're supposed to like spray it
with water and in trying to make it work
with that and so I'm like okay I like
literally digging my brush into this
digging brain with this just to really
intensify and see if that works
I honestly have no words for that one
that one literally took me to the
 ground
what is literally the point of this if
you guys have this let me know how you
guys use it if it works on you like let
me know but it didn't work on me know so
bundle but yeah guys that's it for the
entire video I'll because I had fun
watching act so much fun filming this I
love doing favorites videos and
dissapointment videos or combined I like
doing them come on I feel kind of bad
with disappointing videos I'm always
like I feel bad for the brand you know
like I feel like they're working so hard
and I'm like being a hard-ass bitch on
them you know but it's always love I
absolutely love Mac and I love elf
products and I they have great great
products so it's not means like talking
 about the brand it's just like
these products didn't work for me
personally and if you guys do have them
