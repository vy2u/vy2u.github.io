it saves me what I am so excited because
I'm going to be filming my February
favorites and disappointments or fish I
like favorites and flops I don't know
I've been wanting to do like a little
name for it I've not filmed a favorites
video slash disappointment video and so
long and I have to be so good about it I
would literally film in every single
month I don't get new products but I've
actually noticed as I've been traveling
more and more and more the last
opportunity I have because I had the
less I'm likely to try out more makeup I
don't know why that is I just it just
kind of is how it is I want to know that
makeup I'm using is like bomb so I think
that's kind of why I've been like
slacking on my favorites videos you know
I mean and a lot of people even nowadays
don't really like watching favorites
videos as much I still love watching
them but I love making them and I love
filming them and I love actually showing
you guys products that are just like
bomb is and I was getting such
amazing creature you guys saying thank
you so much for recommending a certain
product and it's worked so good for you
and that's really what I wanted to do so
these are some products that I've been
loving this past month in the past
couple months actually I have a couple
products I have not been loving the past
couple months but yeah you guys that's
what today's video is going to be as
always if you guys don't like this video
if you guys do not like me please don't
 watch it you know the drill with
that
see that highlight that's
telling you have to watch if you
don't like whether you guys do
like the vo please go ahead subscribe to
my channel if you're not already and if
we knew what's up I'm adding anyway and
welcome to my channel thank you so much
for being here I really really
appreciate it but yeah let's go and get
into this February favorites and
dissapointment video also if you guys
are wondering this I look I did film it
that will be going up next week I
believe it's pretty cool I'm actually
really really happy with how it looked
I actually did a recreating a fans
makeup look so that's kind of what this
eye look is going on so you will be
seeing that coming very very soon but
anyway that's going get right into
today's video so number one favorite
product that I've been using the past
month if I can just say just one product
and end the video this is the product
this is the dr. Brandt 2% retinol
complex serum you guys this is the part
that's changed my skin and when it comes
to texture do I still have texture yes
of course iw have texture still but I
promise you and I say that my texture
has diminished literally 50% in the past
month of using this I'm not kidding you
it is like I swear by this am utter
almost done with this I think I have
like another month left in here but I
use this every other night maybe like
three to four times a week and I use of
course SPF with it as well during the
daytime retinol is basically like an
agent that helps clear skin
texture like with like blackheads
whiteheads things like that a lot of you
guys tell me like dude your skin's
looking so good recently what are you
using what the is going on with
your skin why is looking so nice it's
the dr. Brandt 2% retinol cream I mean
I'm sure any 2% retinol will be great to
use it wisely and use it well but this
one I just noticed has been the best for
my skin and doesn't make my skin break
out any way shape or form it's the most
hardcore yet soothing version of this is
what it looks like a little thingy this
little pump I swear by it I swear by it
the next product we're moving right
along I can't talk about this what it
could be - this is a makeup remover that
I've been using consistently this is the
Lancome buy face y'all double action
makeup remover I'm not kidding you guys
when I say this is probably the best eye
makeup remover I've ever tried ever this
 takes off everything literally
doesn't sting your eyes at all it's an
incredible remover it's like shocking
like how bomb it is so I think it's
incredible if you guys are looking for a
really good remover that doesn't sting
your eyes that takes off literally
everything waterproof any makeup you
couldn't need to be taken off this will
take it off for the eyes it's amazing
like holy don't sleep on it Lancome
y'all did that with that one
next moving right along we can talk
about a primer I've been loving the past
month this is from our Borean this is
the pink perfect cream this is a blur
secret glow skin refining four and one
primer or Borean is a Korean skincare
brand I believe and they are now in
Sephora and it's really quiet out with
them up in New York they we have like a
little meeting and they were the
sweetest team ever and they gave
me couple other products try the pink
perfect creamy okay I'll try it out and
bitch I literally am in love with it and
I think the reason why is because one it
is a little bit blurring it's not like
so blurring like a professional or not
so silicone II like that but it gives
you like the most beautiful nourishing
base for your skin while also blurring
your pores a little bit I was like what
the it doesn't really control my
oil don't get me wrong it doesn't as a
base it's incredible like as a skin base
I'm wearing it today as my base like
I've been wearing it every single time
I've been doing my makeup I use
moisturizer and then this and I just
noticed that like let me when I put it
on it just feels luxurious it's like a
rich white woman on the go it's
like oh my god like I can't even handle
how nice this feels I would go to
Sephora get a sample of it just try it
out it's more of an expensive primer for
sure by Georgia guys just try it out see
how it feels on the skin it feels
incredible to me like how you like
glittery oh my god let's put on some
icing right now
I shouldn't be wasting it I know I'm
sorry
it just feels so smooth and so nice and
it dries beautifully it gives you a
little bit of a silky feeling but it's
not too much what it feels like straight
of silicone it's not like that it's
incredible hello hello hello yes can you
hear me perfect I'll be right out okay
my man just got here so I will be right
back anyway he said have to realize I
need to finish this video and I know
these are really really random products
that they're not like fun exciting
products to be talking about but they're
ones that I feel like are gonna be
really really good for like being on the
go you know I mean so next the product I
want to talk about really because I've
actually like gone do like almost half
of this this is the it cosmetics
it's your brush love instant brush
cleaner so you gi you I would use these
cinema secrets cleaner and like a huge
like blue tub it's so intense it's so
big but it smells like pinked and I feel
like every time I use it it's like going
away on my life like this like less less
time in my life being attached to it but
it works so well so my mom actually
embossed this cleaner and she was like
do you want me just try this lip random
cosmetics brush cleaner she's a huge fan
of it cosmetics as am i I love them too
and I was like oh let's try it out and
this guy's is like the complete opposite
of what the other one is it cleans your
brushes amazingly but it smells like
citrusy and it smells so good and then
greens just so much much better than
what the last one was like of course
there's AG alcohol in it and whatnot if
you are someone that like has makeup
brushes and doesn't want to clean them
like D clean up every single time try
the a cosmetics brush love it is so so
good and that's like and has a pump on
it you have to like pour into a little
thing and use it it's just like balm I
can literally wear this as
perfume we have next ooh this one is
like the product of the month as well
this is the anasazi XM r ez highlighter
you guys I don't feel like there's like
anything else to say besides I've used
this so many times on my channel now
I've talked about it so many times my
channel now it's just like girl this
highlighter on God's green earth you
know what I like about this one so much
is because when you put it on it doesn't
give you a golden cast on your skin
could you see I feel like with the
really gold highlighters I love them so
much but I feel like they do since I am
a lighter a complexion and gives you
like a golden cast this one is gold with
no cast it just gives you a golden shine
and it doesn't give you like a weird
like if you turn it's like gold so if
like that's what I really would like
about it it's such a high shine it
builds so nicely it goes from like such
a subtle shine to like a beaming
so quickly and I just feel like it's
amazing I just want to congratulate uh
Nastasia Beverly Hills
nor Vina and I'm ready for this amazing
highlighter you guys absolutely killed
it I love Hamra she's such a wonderful
person I think she's the sweetest nor
Vina as well like you guys are just both
amazing and congratulations on this
amazing collaboration part two of our
easy to guys never went our music came
out with a palace ass yeah old old
school right there those are the good
times next part I want talk about really
quickly actually have two glosses here
because I've been really really into
gloss recently gloss has been something
that I'm just like dude I love a good
gloss or a really creamy lipstick these
two are some of the ones I've been
wearing very frequently this is the dose
of colors can you not after this is the
today's the first time I ever tried this
one I'm not gonna lie this is what I've
been wearing really frequently today was
the first time I tried this out and I
honestly love it it's actually the gloss
I'm wearing today those the clothes came
out the new like high coverage glosses
we're going to swatch it on my hand you
guys let's see what the color is it's
basically a really beautiful take a
dirty pink it's like more of a
cool-toned dirty pink it's not too too
bright it's not too cool it's just a
really really pretty neutral pinky color
I think it's beautiful and you just Josh
shine it's alright comfortable on the
lips you want it to not wear lipstick
and get a good like high coverage full
coverage on the lips I will really
suggest a new dose of colors classes and
they smell like cake batter okay guys
and then the second class I want talk
about is of course the event a beauty
event a glow gloss balm this is like one
of the best classes I've ever
encountered it's so comfortable it
smells amazing like water mmmm hmmm no
it smells like fruit punch that's like
the one cent I can say it smells like
fruit punch the coverage is not nearly
as much as the other one as you can see
there's a lot more streakiness in it but
this is more of a high shine comfort
glass or doesn't like give you like a
lot of coverage it's literally just a
beautiful high glossy gloss and it
smells amazing and it feels amazing and
it's not sticky it's a really really
lightweight formula it has a high shine
to it and it's from Fanta beauty
who doesn't love finding beauty honesty
at this point so last but not least when
it comes to the favorites of this month
I want to talk about this really quickly
I've not used this that many times I
will use it a couple times but honestly
I've noticed how incredible it is and
I'm really shocked at how nice this
product was this is the BH Cosmetics
zodiac pellet one the fact that it's a
Zodiac palette that's already literally
like so cute go BH that's
adorable but I want to talk about this
color
in the middle specifically and you know
the reason I even tried it it's because
of freakin Rocio Orozco say ah this is
cuz a-you bitch this color in the middle
right here is so incredibly beautiful as
like it's like a white with this golden
undertone that's so so nice so these are
like big shades I'm gonna show you
swatch a couple of there so I can show
you guys the big shades are so creamy
and nice it's like really weird like how
incredible these are I'm not kidding you
I was taking it back these are
definitely more on the powdery side
there's no denying if it's a little bit
powdery but I feel like they can
definitely be worked with how beautiful
these are like they're actually really
really intense and they're BH Cosmetics
are really really cheap and the mats are
super smooth and super nice and super
blendable like later like my mind was
blown not even trying this out she
wasn't wrong like these this is really
nice especially for a drugstore brand
like BH Cosmetics for them to come out
with such a nice palette like this for
such a cheap affordable price it's 25
shadows that comes with oh that's a
highlighter ah 25 color and highlighter
palette that's nuts like that's
incredible you know what we look up how
much is this one I'm actually quite
curious its 22 bucks for 25 waiting for
25 you know you're joking
nope 22 bucks i I don't know that one I
truly don't know how they did that
that's like incredible pricing wow I
just think it's so good it has a great
variety of Matt's as well those Matt's
right there those neutral transitioning
Matt's they're really nice of it your
deep shades you have a back of a brown
you have some purples
I think it's really nice and I'm like
really really impressed I'd be H on this
one really impressed okay so that is it
for my favorites I only have two
disappointments and we are gonna be done
with today's video so first one I want
to talk about I already talked about
this actually on my channel I'm sure
guys watched it I did a reviewing
products are super super low rated at
Sephora and this one and I think the
reason why it is two-faced white peach
palette took the cake for me as you guys
I was actually so excited about it you
know when you're excited about something
you tried out in your disappointing that
you're making it makes it look so much
more disappointed that's how I felt with
this so I tried these shades out and
honestly they were just not good the one
like the mats were like not that
pigmented these shimmers were not that
great either
and they
give me any kind of like trying on this
like on the idol I just like the colors
were not cohesive enough these two
layers are cohesive I think the first
two layers are fantastic but these four
look when you cover that what what kind
of what peach has power is that
this is a peach palette they should have
kept it at eight and made the shades
better they made it twelve and a lot of
them didn't really work very well I just
didn't like this palette that was really
really poorly done and I wanted to like
it a lot and that's why I was so
disappointed like I was so I've had so
much high hopes for him just really I
was like you know I really wanted to
live for it but I couldn't and I was a
really big Sequoia frame and second is
my palette of the month was actually
this night honestly again this is one of
the things where I like had such high
hopes and expectations and I was sorely
let down this is the Mac Jeremy Scott
palette the packaging I just have to say
before we even start the packaging is a
plus this is so cool beautiful so well
done the whole entire collection is
amazing Jeremy Scott is absolutely using
Mac's amazing but you know what really
disappointed me of the palette is when
you open it you're like oh my god I'm
gonna be getting something so crazy so
 lit I'm gonna be living I just
feel like when I opened it I was like oh
look I just wasn't happy like one the
colors are just so off like it just
they're so off to me I'm looking at him
and I'm like what the is going on
like what's happening I get the whole
like color scheme per bar I'd miss
immunity like this is a very like
Valentine's Day bar this is like a
bronzy neutral bar a blue bar a purple
bar I just feel like one the amount per
shadow was like a joke like literally
that's such a little amount and
literally look when you're looking at it
feels like a kid's like a kid's palette
and I wasn't really impressed and like i
swatched a couple of them and they were
super powdery super just like chunky and
I'm sure a lot of them blend great I'm
sure a lot of them worked very nicely
and feel great but swatching so um I'm
like oh my gosh this is not good
dead-ass the zodiac palette is like
nicer than this one and I were just
disappointed because like the way the
packaging setup everything all the
packaging all the product is so
beautiful on the outside I bet that a
lot more to do with Jeremy Scott and Mac
had to do with of course the formulas of
the product but I was just disappointed
in the actual formula of it and the
amount you're beginning and just in
general like it just didn't look
appealing to me I thought it was like
the whole idea was really cool that was
like a like a music bar situation I
don't know but it looked really
cool look sickening about the end of the
day it just they didn't perform very
well what I was disappoint when
open it I was like oh hey you don't like
the color scheme I don't like how much
product is in here I don't like all the
black empty space around it it just
doesn't make sense to me and that is you
guys that's it for my favorites and
disappointments of the entire month it
was so much fun queenÃ­s with you guys I
love doing them hope you guys enjoy them
as well I think they're just a cool fun
way to kind of interact about our
