today's video is going to be my February
favorites video February has been such
an amazing ass month in the beauty world
I like to think so I might be biased but
February is a good month cuz I really
wanted to talk about a couple products
I've been using this month that I've
been living for and breathing for and
dining for and going to jail for so
they're just balm but I've actually
already filmed this video but my footage
was completely corrupted because the
audio was up so I'm refilling it
that is dedication because I was just
gonna end it today and I hope the mill
was I'd enjoy makeup again it was a mess
it was a mess so hope you guys like this
video I'm gonna stop rambling I've like
a rainbow a lot during the serious
videos so I'm just gonna go ahead and
get into it
as always if you guys want to spew if
you guys do like me please don't
what you know the Jo with that but if
you enjoyed this video and you guys do
like me please like this video and
subscribe to my channel if you weren't
already and if you're new what's up a
mani mani a mule a and welcome to my
channel welcome to the maniac family
frolic frolic upon among the others
drink the kool-aid okay let's get into
this video
okay first things first first rate Ritz
I'm sure you guys knew this was gonna be
the favorites I keep my first gun
flunking so good is the mani anyway and
the makeup geek collaboration palette
and this came out this month for it's
been so crazy this launch was insane we
broke the sight my mani ex broke the
sight it was crazy
sold out like the next day in like
minutes and it was just it was gnarly
yeah I'm not gonna go full into detail
about this pile because I do have a
video about the pot specifically but
this is what it looks like I think it's
absolutely beautiful I hit pan on Mars
because I did a photo shoot using Mars
like I kind of scraped some onto a cup
and sprinkled it onto my face to do a
photo shoot so it's really tricky right
now the whole pie looks janky but it has
character may have stories okay but I
absolutely love this palette so much
I will leave where buy it down below as
well as a video about the palette if you
guys want to see that as well if it sold
out right now I feel like when this
video goes up it will be sold out so
what I would suggest to you is go to my
link click the link go to where the
palette page is there's a button where
it says sign up for email notification
to get notified when the palette is back
in stock so that's what I would do if
you guys it's really easy just put your
name in your email it's super fast super
easy done you're good to go but it just
a good way to get notified when the
palette is back in stock rather than
having to wait and not know if you're
gonna be able to get it when it does
come back so yeah just that's my
suggestion that's what I would suggest
you guys might want to thank you to
everyone and all the other Beauty people
and influencers that have been talking
my palette and doing Q Torrez with my
pal I really appreciate you guys like I
truly do it's been such an amazing
positive response and I really hope you
guys do love it when you guys get it and
it's been an intense ride with this
bitch but we waited a long time we have
waited a long time but it's finally here
and I think it's beautiful so hope you
guys like it also this month I wanted to
give another pallet some love and some
credit and some just work
credit is due where credit is mother if
I can do it is the hidden treasure
palette by just colors this palette the
color force all the cotton it is so
travel friendly and the cardboard is
amazing love the packaging and the open
it it's these stunning ass colors look
at how awesome this palette is this is
an amazing ass palette I used it a
couple times and I just think it's
absolutely stunning
it's a beautiful palette the quality of
these shadows you guys like I'm not
kidding you like like are you joking
this gold this is like true gold here
like what the hell it's honestly I'm
using and I'm so proud of dose of colors
I think dose of colors is such an
amazing brand and I love it liquid
lipsticks and I think they're just doing
everything right like they started with
Luca lipsticks they started to expand
from do these little blue lips is what
our day start with lashes I don't
remember I just think they're doing a
really great job on social media and
being in the social media brand I think
they're doing everything that a brand on
social media should be doing and I just
love dose I love Anna if you ever
watched my videos I don't think you do
but if you ever do I love you guys and
you guys are so great and I'm so proud
of you guys this company it's come such
a long way I don't even know if this is
in stock right now - it might be sold
out as well because this palette is a
hot item there are four matte shades
there are one two three four five four
oldies type shades and one shimmery
shade there's ten shadows total I think
it's $50 which is again five dollars per
shadow a great great great price point
reminds me of my table with Megan peak
final - I don't plug shameless plug I
just think it's an awesome palette and
hopefully it isn't stuck on my sure if
it is or not but it's absolutely amazing
and I would definitely recommend it you
guys bomb those colors guys also one
more thing from dose of colors I want
talk about this month I've been loving
are the dose of colors ideal duo basis
my favorite one is the shade shell it is
so beautiful it's a pigment but it's a
glitter at the same time it's like
hardly explain it's like a glitter
pigment what it is it's like a little
pot like this and you get your base
color down first so you get like this
cream base it literally a cream and you
like put it down first and then you open
it up and you put the pigment glitter on
top of it to make it stand out more head
stick to the base so this what it looks
like when I have the base and I have the
powder on top of it like the pigment
part it is just actually something I
like shell because it's like a when you
look at it it's like a pearlized
pinky bronze color it's stunning like
it's stunning again those are Claire's
you guys have been slinging it like so
hard recently like I'm so proud of you
guys you guys can't check out the ideal
Joes I think they're absolutely amazing
and they're not too expensive either and
I think it's cool that it is a base you
got a cream base to go with the pigment
that you have as well so it's like a
double duty kind of product and I love
it I think it's an awesome product so
now I talked about a couple of brushes
I've been loving for this month um first
two I'm talking about are from morphe
these are like these have been my tried
and true for the past couple of months
actually not even just one month is past
couple months these have been my saving
grace so first one I'll talk about is
the e 18 this is a dense pencil brush
because it's kind of like the e36 double
the size and like
more dense I just really like to use
this for underneath my lash line I'll
just kind of blow out a smoky eye using
this if I want to do more something more
precise I'll use the e36 but if I want
to just blend out a lot of product
because the circumference of this one is
a lot bigger I'll use this brush instead
it really has to change it up my under
eye game and I know it sounds kind of
funny and like weird like who cares
where your under eye game bitch I do hi
I need my under eye to look blended and
flawless
especially when I'm going into like
events and stuff I'm like that needs to
be like a smokey a smoky waterfall you
know and that's what the e18 does for me
everything it's absolutely amazing it's
dense enough but it's not too dense
blends out everything's seamlessly it's
just an amazing amazing brush I would
highly recommend this one and the second
brush I'll talk about is the e43 by
morphe and this is completely opposite
this is a dense flat definer brush out
of the essence see it you see the
denseness of this pitch it's a little
line it's literally the skinniest brush
I own it's literally like besides like
the EO six by Sigma skinniest brush I
own and it's great at applying pigment
or product to the bottom lash line and
just kind of using it to the press in
the product I'll pick up like a darker
shade like Aphrodite from my palette and
I'll press it into the lashes and then
I'll use like the e 18 to blend it out
or the e36 to blend it out and it turns
out so nicely I just really like this
because I feel like of all the little
like pencil brushes or all the detail
brushes I have to pack on product this
has been my most used like literally
like the of the whole the whole month
like this one really does get so close
to your lash line because it is so
skinny and and so defined and tapered
and I'm just it's just so good it's so
good I would really recommend if you
guys like to do that kind of stuff on
the lower lash line where I like to
smoke it out or you guys want to do like
a natural lower lash line and blend that
out I would definitely recommend both of
these the 18 and the e 43 by morphe I am
in a morphine affiliate right there like
literally one of my favor brands to work
with ever my codes Manning MUA in all
caps if you guys want to save money if
you guys know it's all good in store
online it's just if you guys want to
save some extra cash
you can use that code and save 10% on
anything on the whole site also like
these only like five bucks each I think
and you're save 10% to that so it just
you just say more money you can say
Mormon okay be a definite recommend
these highly highly highly highly and
then the other person I wanna talk about
is like an honorable mention because
I've been living for this brush and I've
been waiting for to come out for
literally like two months is the new
benefit hoola bronzer brush
look at this brush the bamboo handle the
blue bristle tip like are you kidding me
look how cute this like this is the
cutest brush this isn't meant for hula
the powder hoola saw you looking
literally dip into the box of powder and
just kind of go in what the face start
bronzing up the skin I just think it's
such a beautiful brush and it's at the
perfect size and it's absolutely
stunning it's almost like I don't want
to use it because it's so pretty and
then you're riding like Kylie Jenner's
hair like when she did that on break
from black to blue it reminds me of that
like in a brush for him I just mean
absolutely amazing and I love that
benefit is expanding their new hoola
line I went to Hawaii recently been if I
just come back a couple days ago and it
was an amazing amazing experience I'm
trying to edit the vlog for it right now
they expanded their entire hoola line as
well as some of their dandelion line and
you have like the new liquid bronzer now
you get the body bronzer you get this
it's just it's cool I just think it's
really awesome because benefit is one of
my favorite brands to work with and I
love that they have a personality like
their brand you know its iconic ly
benefit and I appreciate that about them
you know like and I really wish it the
fact that they are willing to work with
boys you know like me and Patrick and
it's just it's amazing
I think benefit is really like a
front-runner in the cosmetic world and I
even like the trips like the trips that
they let the brands do now benefit
started the whole thing you know to me
and so it just like benefit you go
trendsetters you so I'm just really
proud benefit and I'm so proud of the
company and things that they've done and
I'm so honored to be working with them
and the thing and doing things with them
so benefit I'm so proud of you guys and
I love this brush so much if you guys
can check it out the bristles are
synthetic and they feel so good there I
mean that you'll eat brushes buy more
feet like those soft ass like
high-intensity like good brushes that
ceramides me up so check it out only
three products left guys okay only three
okay so I wanna talk about this really
quickly because it is absolutely amazing
I want to talk about the new makeup geek
contour pans make a gink you
slave my line fall honestly the contra
pans are so good they're the read some
of the cleanest most buttery blendable
powder contours I've ever ever ever
tried they literally remind me of the
Kat Von D shading like palette like that
kind of blend ability that pigmentation
and butteriness to it which i absolutely
love that's my favorite contour palette
of like all-time and so the fact that
they makeup geek contra colors feel like
that and they blend like down they work
like that makes me so happy I'm using it
today obviously I literally have used
them every single day
that I've worn makeup every single every
single time I'm not
like I don't even use like my other
contour products anymore I just love
these so much the only 10 bucks to like
are you kidding me the shade range is
amazing to those eight shades total just
for warm for cool and they literally
range from like the lightest lightest
skin tone to the darkest of skin tones
but I love all make it peak is that they
really do cater to every skin tone which
I just love about them and I really
appreciate that about a brand you know
not all brands cater to every skin tone
and make it big does so I really do
appreciate that so much and the concert
rates are amazing they are very very
pigmented though so you have to be
careful you barely dip your brush in and
then work from there don't like swirl
your brush and then go in because you
will literally have like a
stripe on your face so be calm with it
and be patient my favorite color and
that I use all the time is bad habit
that's the one I use for my face and the
one I use for my nose don't need
somebody knows this is my travel palette
this is what I take with me 20s for my
nose is break up because that's the
cooler tone and that had this little
warmer tone so I really really really
like those two shades this is the Marc
Jacobs the blacker eyeliner I have
literally never used an eyeliner that is
this amazing I'm pretty sure I'd
literally never use another Islander
that's literally this bomb honestly like
the most of black eyeliner it's a very
creamy
and it stays in the waterline very very
nicely which I really appreciate this
expensive I was like 29 bucks I'll eerie
song I was like you're joking $29 but
like Marc Dickens's Marc Jacobs I do are
paying for really good quality products
you're not paying like just for the name
you are paying for really good like
swear like their products are actually
bomb they have a bunch of variety of
shades too I know they have like maroon
and green and brown and they have a
bunch of shades
it's wenting cuz sometimes the floor
will have like a perk that's like a
100-point perk that's like a small
version of this is like half the size
and I'm like five seven hail dirty looks
like stock up when they have the perks
because I love this eyeliner so much if
I could ever suggest you guys an awesome
minor like I got my mom hooked on this
one too she loves the Marc Jacobs
eyeliner and it's a gel like formula so
it's really really really blendable very
glide the bowl and it's not gonna like
tug at your eyes when you put it on your
waterline or anything like that so loved
it and last but not least I'm kind of
sad that it's over
I love favorites videos damn it this is
the colour-pop ultra satin lip stick in
the shade magic wand it's a shade I'm
wearing right now and I think it's
absolutely beautiful I came in with this
lip I'm honestly so freaking impressed
with colourpop's ultra satin lip line
they just launched like a crazy craft
ton of colors and there
absolutely amazing colour-pop is really
getting their freakin together and
they were gonna like rule the
world I swear to god they're doing so
good right now I didn't like the matte
lipsticks I think when they first
launched I thought they were very
crumbly and I thought they were just not
a good product and I think that every
single time they launched since then
like more colors our liquid lipsticks
they've been a lot better like the
Kathleen's Lumiere - the liquid
lipsticks update but they did that one
was really nice and so I'm like hmm
maybe she kept color probably cool if
it's another chance but I really
appreciate that about the brand you know
like they're listening to the consumer
which I love the ultra satin lips like
right away they're bomb like right away
they have a beautiful consistency
they're very very pigmented I can do
this and it's very comfortable it is
like a satin lipstick it's not like a
liquid lipstick where I dry something
matte like you have a lot of wiggle room
with this one I mean it transfers it
will transfer because it's not dry
completely like if I were to kiss some
hand it would be on my hand by they say
on the lips really really nicely like
they last for hours on the lips they're
not like normal satin lipsticks like a
tube lipstick where they like literally
will leave your lips like a minute in
you know look at the pigmentation - like
it's actually freaking amazing see
Congrats - colour-pop because you guys
 killed it with these ultra satin
lips and I would definitely suggest for
you guys to get some for sure not sold
on the lipsticks just yet but these ones
100% sold get them and that is it for my
entire February favorites video I just I
would get so sad when I finish something
so I'm just like man we're done I just
love favorites videos because I think
they're just they're fun and I like to
sit down and talk to you guys as it's
like talking to a friend about my
