this video please subscribe to my
channel if you're not already and if
you're new what's up a man um you a and
welcome to my channel but yeah let's go
against this Fenty beauty review hits
misses
okay let's go ahead and get started a
lot of these products I have not used
but I will let you know of the products
I have used and that I have tried and
I'll have of course a stronger opinion
on those a lot of these things are gonna
be more of a first impressions for me as
well so let's get started I have not
tried this so this is the offensive
beauty Pro filter soft matte primer and
this guy retails for $32 and you get how
much you guys get in here one point zero
eight fluid ounces which is a really
good amount of product for a primer
that's very very very fair okay it comes
out more of a creamy almost like a
lotion tea consistency yeah it feels
like lotion 100% so we're camped out all
over the skin smells really nice
actually smells like lotion feels
occlusion - I think there's definitely
some drag when I'm putting on the skin
like I really have to like move the
product whoa much more viscous but it
feels really nice on the skin so
personally I have also been using a
little bit of pore fessional from
benefit in the t-zone I have again
gnarly pores and I feel like it really
helps this one nation look a lot better
so a little bit of professional in the
center so now I'm gonna take the little
foundation brush it's very thick a very
dense very soft I'm liking it and I'm
gonna take a V foundation this is the
fancy Beauty Foundation it says shake
well shake weight and you get one point
zero eight fluid ounces in here and this
retails for $34 so I think that is such
a fair price point for a foundation I
think that's actually really amazing
when I tell you that I've worn this
foundation every single day that I was
in New York I'm not kidding since Friday
I had been wearing this foundation every
single day that I was in New York every
single day because I liked it so much
and I'm not kidding it's literally like
when I found my favorite foundations
right now every single day I worn this
I've been complimented on my skin and
I'm like yo and when that's happening
bitch so this is more of a soft and
matte foundation and gives you about a
medium coverage it doesn't give you
really full full coverage unless you
build it up to be more full but again it
looks beautiful on the skin and I
definitely can say it builds up very
nicely I build it to be full personally
because I'm a full coverage girl but if
you're not a full coverage kind of
person this one nations still wonderful
because it gives you a really nice
medium coverage doesn't look really
scary on the skin it just looks really
pretty but it does dry very quickly so
you need to work with it kind of quickly
and like really make sure that gets into
the skin nicely you know patting motions
of course will give you more coverage
and I'll take one more pump and I'll
take the little Rihanna
beauty sponge this is the first time you
it it's very soft very squishy so I like
that I'm gonna pounce out all over the
skin but I'm just $16 those cheaper than
the Beautyblender but it feels like the
Beautyblender which is pretty nice I'm
just gonna pop this all over the skin
just to build up the coverage a little
bit and again this is in the shade at
2:30 I like this one matches me a little
bit better when I was at the event they
have like different little sections that
you can go and try some of the products
and you can pick what you wanted to have
and they were color matching people but
I thought this was really weird like
their color matching people and there
was a lot of red lighting everywhere it
wasn't like natural white light or there
wasn't no like there was no sunlight so
people that were getting matched I'm
assuming we're getting matched with the
wrong shade I grabbed the shade 230 cuz
I matched myself and I'm like hopefully
this is like decent and it was decent it
was totally fine don't get me wrong but
it wasn't like definitely my color even
this one is a little bit dark for me but
it's so more neutral as you can see guys
it is definitely a soft matte finish
it's not really shiny whatsoever but
it's not super matte I think it's
perfect I love that it literally looks
like it filtered on your skin sets
itself foundation so the next product
that we have are the match sticks these
retail for 25 dollars and I'm gonna take
the shade maple and it's a basically is
like a bronzy shade how much product you
get inside of it you get point 25 ounces
which of course I really do not think
this is a lot of product I think it's
actually a very little amount of product
for 25 bucks and you'll see where I put
this or no okay we're not gonna use that
shade because that's literally doing
nothing gotta grab the shade amber as
well this is more of a cool tone contour
shade okay so maple was a flop
amber was a flop let's go and try to
shade mocha now because I just feel like
those are really not working this is
definitely much more of a darker one
citizens there we go no more heck you're
in and now we're gonna take V contour
and concealer brush this is like a
little tiny brush that they have and
this retails for okay so this little
guys 24 bucks it's like a kind of omelet
go little contour brush I think this is
um I don't know man I personally would
not spend 25 bucks on this I definitely
would not buy it myself
but if you guys are fans of Rihanna
awesome I'm gonna go ahead and blend
this matchstick in with the foundation
okay
okay that definitely looks a lot better
than it does on this side it's still not
like living for it though hold on we're
gonna try it on this
yeah I'm gonna do it like this this is
how I'm gonna apply I'm not gonna play
it from the stick directly to me the
sticks a little bit too hard and I feel
like they take off too much product but
they blend out pretty good there's
definitely no harsh lines or anything
that but of course I am stippling with
this little brush and I would definitely
suggest applying it with a brush and not
applying it directly on your skin well
the color is beautiful I like mocha a
lot that's definitely the color that
works the best for me so it blends out
don't get me wrong I just think that it
takes a little bit of time to blend out
it's not like an easy like quick thing
as much with the sponge it definitely
blends up a lot nicer than it does with
the little brush I would definitely not
really suggest the brush the sponge is a
lot prettier and it looks a lot more
diffuse and not as harsh it's not my
favorite product it's definitely my
favorite product the the cream stick in
the contour shape let's go and try the
light shade this is supposed to be a
concealer and highlighter in one also
guys one more thing I fuckin love
Rihanna I love her so much
I think she's literally amazing and if I
can fucking switch lives with anyone it
would be her but that does not mean I'm
not gonna be as honest as I possibly can
be in a review about her products all
I'm saying is I'm gonna be honest no
matter what and if you guys don't like
that if you guys think that I'm being
like mean towards her or if you guys are
gonna be intense and like defend her yo
I get that but it's a review I'm a
youtuber this is what I do full-time and
so because I love Rihanna just because
you guys love Rihanna does not mean that
every single product of hers is gonna
work amazingly for me personally the
matchstick contour stick was not a win
again this is like one of those products
that's not it's not as emollient it's
nice creamy you doesn't have to like
press on so you don't take off any of
the coverage okay cold now we're gonna
take the little sponge again we're gonna
blend this out so it says you're
supposed to be able to conceal with this
as well and I personally don't think you
can I think it definitely leaves a lot
of darkness here but it is definitely
brightening I would definitely use this
as more of a brightening highlighting
stick and not a concealer stick
whatsoever
it doesn't really cover anything but
it's very brightening which I love and I
feel like the highlight stick blends a
little bit easier than the contour stick
maybe because I'm lighter in complexion
that could be it okay we need some real
can see there on this too
okay I'm gonna take a little bit of some
concealer for real and put it underneath
my eyes just to really actually conceal
yeah that's what I want to see see that
okay dude this is the difference this is
like really brightening conceals my
darkness this is not as brightening of
course I want full coverage underneath
that I girl hall full coverage we're
gonna go ahead and quickly set my under
eye because I do have concealer on
there so I can definitely see a
difference between the highlighter stick
and the contour stick I do like the
highlighting stick don't get me wrong I
think it actually does really brighten
up everything for shirt but I would not
use it as a concealer stick it does not
conceal to me it does not cover up
really anything but it does highlight
really nicely and I definitely see in a
wake under eye like it's definitely much
more like oh no I feel just yet I'm not
really huge into like cream contouring
as much so this is definitely a little
bit more different for me now we have
one more stick product we have
highlighting shimmer sticks that are
also $25 a pop there are also point 25
ounces I grabbed to shade we have the
shade starstruck and the shade unicorn
those look like the most fun to me and
look like the most like I would be in -
so we're gonna take the shade unicorn on
the floor this suppose we get purple
okay so yeah I see it I see the purple I
see all right there I definitely see
something I'm seeing something I might
just blend out a little bit and what we
think the foundation comes off the stick
use a fucking applicator for the sticks
I'm just telling you I think your life's
gonna be a lot easier if you use in a
little some type of thing to apply it
where like a brush or a sponge because
I'm telling you it like comes off the
foundation comes off
starstruck and we can do a little there
we go I'll just like quickly do it I'll
bounce it Star Trek's looking a very
beautiful on camera whoo whoo yes God
I'm a plane like this like if I swipe
the foundation is gonna come right off
so I'm actually living for starstruck
right now girl it does a beautiful on
the skin starstruck specifically I'm not
really a huge fan of unicorn I think it
disappeared pretty quickly and doesn't
look purple whatsoever starstruck yes
unicorn no and then we had actual I
wanted to zoom in a little bit more so
you guys can see what they look like a
little bit closer she came out with a
fucking slew a slew of highlighters we
have all these bad bitches are her okay
so the highlighters are retailed for $34
these are the kilowatt highlighters they
come with a point 28 ounces of product
eight grams of product and these come
with seven grams of product so the one
that I'm living for the most honestly
the one I'm gasping for air for is
trophy wife so this is trophy wife it is
a gnarly-ass gold shade it's very
intense it has a glitter
likes in it it's one of those
highlighters I had a fucking whoa like
whoa it's extremely extremely gold
almost too gold for my complexion I
don't think that looks very good on me
because it is so ridiculously gold but
we're gonna put it on my skin anyway so
we can see what it looks like so we have
a metal moon which is a lighter version
is much more white shade this is what
you get off this one this is metal moon
right here next to it this is it right
here this one's a lot more powdery it's
not as reflective it's okay the metal
moon ones okay it's not my favorite so
then we also have these guys which are a
two-in-one highlighter this is in the
shade mean money and hustle baby so
let's go and swatch these guys so we
have a more blinding intense side which
is this one and we have a more soft
subtle side on this side so we have them
both right here so I decided we have
that gnarly intense fucking blinding ass
bitch right here and then we have this
subtle bitch for every day so that is
really cool about this you guys can make
it more subtle you guys can amp it up
with a with the other shade if you guys
want it to be more intense which i think
is really cool then also grab the shade
lightning dust and fire crystal let's
watch these guys as well they look like
this on the hand they're much more white
very pretty
I really do love the kilowatts these
guys right here not a fan of that one
and I think trophy wife's amazing so
let's go and watch some of these guys on
the face are these apply some I'm gonna
put some over this and here we have the
cheek hugging highlighter brush which
retails for 32 pitch it's a go shark fin
so we're gonna take this shade at trophy
wife and we're gonna apply that on the
left side of the cheek I'm packing it
onto the brush it packs on very
intensely
we're gonna play right here hugs the
cheek y'all do you all see that fucking
shit dude like that is so intense like
Jesus what the fuck she is shit
that's crazy so on the skin as you can
see from here looks like the yellow
patch on my face when I'm looking
head-on which i think is kind of
annoying this is definitely not a shade
that is like works for me very nicely
but again it is beautiful I would say
more so for medium to deeper complexion
this is a fair skin I'm gonna take the
shade metal moon and put that one right
here it's right there on the forehead as
you can see it's alright it's definitely
nothing special I would not buy metal
moon
so ever I don't think it's that nice now
we're gonna take the shade and hustle
baby I'll put that on this side over
this highlighter I want to take the
other white one on top of this area okay
guys I look like a fucking glazed
doughnut nut case on this side Jesus
Christ it looks really nice damn buck
okay honestly they're stunning the
highlighters the kilowatt highlighters
are so sickening
I still love trophy wife I've already
worn it on my eyes and I think it's
stunning as an eyeshadow the duo's
stunning I loved them metal moon not my
thing not my favorite one so I'll pass
on this guy but the other three fucking
nice man so last but not least we have
the venti beauty gloss balm universal
lip Luminizer for $18 its 0.3 announces
a product and it is of course a gloss or
lip topper gloss type situation I love
the big dope applicator whoo oh good oh
my god yo this feels so nice
it's like slightly tacky but not too
tacky where you're like oh this is
sticky it's not sticky you're gonna feel
it on the lips for sure it's more of a
heavy gloss but it's so fucking stun
team this is a hit for me this is a hit
for I'm this highlight is distracting
cuz it's so blinding okay guys and that
is it for the review on me fenty a
beauty collection by Rihanna all in all
what do I think of the line I think the
line is absolutely beautiful I think
that they did a great great job kendo is
the brand that owns phantom beauty right
rihanna is basically the face of fenty
beauty it's like Fanta beauty by Rihanna
but kendo is like the brains behind it
they're the brand that owns it's the
same thing with like Marc Jacobs beauty
you know kendo owns Marc Jacobs beauty
it's not just Marc Jacobs beauty I think
that kendo did an amazing amazing job in
no Rihanna of course was very very
involved as well I can definitely tell
that this line was a collaborative thing
it wasn't just done by one person things
I did not try in this video where the
blotting powder I am NOT I'll need to
blot right now but I have used it and it
did work fantastically and the blotting
paper I did not use in takes video you
because I don't need to black also
worked fantastically and is a really
really fun like a little roller
situationally you kind of pad off but
all in all I think the line is great
there were some definite hits though
some definite misses for me personally
no line is literally perfect in my eyes
I think that there's always room for
improvement there's always room for
growth when it comes to collections and
things like that the foundation is
incredible the primary felt fantastic
the other highlighters were incredible
I'm like the brushes were fantastic a
glass is beautiful I mean it's a it's a
glass like it's not like revolutionary
of course but not by any means but it is
beautiful and it feels really nice on
the lips and if you bought the glass you
would not be disappointed but yeah you
