today's video is going to be a fun just
chit chat get ready with me I've not
done these just sat down got ready for
an event and so long I thought would be
really fun to bring in so many new
products that have just come out in this
past month of June so Mikey cool let's
do a get ready with me and first
impressions video I'm actually heading
out to the season finale taping of
RuPaul's Drag Race later on today so my
base products like my foundation will be
the same but a lot of other products
will be new and I was thinking like dude
man you're already gonna be glamming
might as well just film it so I thought
it'd be really fun to film this video so
that's what today's video is going to be
as always if you guys don't like this
video if you guys do not like me please
don't watch it you know the
drill with that mmm-hmm what do you guys
do likes video please subscribe to my
channel if you're not already and if you
knew what's up am an emu a and welcome
to my channel thank you so much for
being here I honestly really appreciate
it so much
um let's go and get into this first
impressions get ready with me because
bitch needs to get ready and like leave
down my two hours so so I'm actually
really really excited because I am
actually partnering in this video today
with dr. jart which is a skincare brand
inside Sephora and I don't really ever
get to do a lot of sponsorships or a lot
of partnering with brands on videos
because ones the brands that I really
really like and wanna partner with they
think I'm a little too outlandish and
they don't ever wanna sponsor me and the
ones that do I don't ever like their
products so not trying to be shady to
the brands that one it's not to me no
shade whatsoever I'm just not going to
be dishonest to my audience about liking
something so I'm dr. John hit me up like
Haley would love to do video with you I
was like yes so many products to see if
I like them and they sent me them and I
absolutely freaking love them we have
the new water fuse line by dr. jar and
this is inside Sephora this month they
launched in June we have the hydro
soothe i jo and we have the dr. jart
water fuse ultimate hydro gel for the
face and I'm going to be using this on
the face today to moisturize my skin
it's like hella light blue so you guys
can't really tell by view so much of
this I don't you guys didn't see that
the lighting is a little rough but I'm
gonna take a little bit on the finger
what I like about this moisturizer is
that it's so lightweight but still so
freakin hydrating like it literally
feels like water on the skin it doesn't
feel tacky oh I love it's very like
cooling like refreshing should I be
using it all month long because I'm
never gonna do a sponsorship or like
partner with a brand if I don't try the
products a lot so
it feels so good oh and of course the
eye cream it's just a really nice
hydrating deep puffing eye cream like a
great for the daytime like these guys I
use every single morning because well
one I'm a psycho about my skin being
hydrated and I need it to be hydrated
doesn't look like water like it just
it's so at I love it and both textures
are so lightweight and just cooling and
just refreshing and that's why I like
them so much thank you guys over at dr.
jart for partnering with me I really
really really enjoyed your guys's
products and if you guys want a nice
just everyday beautiful hydrating
moisturizer and under eye balm try these
because I am they good okay cool so
let's go and just continue on with the
normal face routine I'm gonna be taking
the benefit professional of course okay
so my mom and dad are up here this
weekend and that means Emmie and Sophie
are up here this weekend and it's so so
 funny because Xia loves love's
Emmie like she loves to play with her
shield monster like around with her
a lot but I mean literally wants nothing
to do with her so it's kind of like Xia
she don't wanna with you the base
guys the base of my face I'm gonna keep
pretty chill and normal just like my
normal routine just cuz I really want to
make sure that it lasts ooh wait let me
so last year I actually attended the
RuPaul's Drag Race
finale viewing and it was so much fun
but it was so long I had no idea
we got there at 3 o'clock we delete oh I
think 11 p.m. it's such a long process
like filming the show cuz it's how it
works so all three winners are crowned
as like winners because they don't want
to get out who actually wins
so basically gonna kind of fake it like
they like all three win so it's like oh
my god
this person won yay oh my god this
person won yeah this was someone and so
it's like during the actual finale is
when they reveal on TV who actually won
that's why I'm it takes so long to get
to like go through all three winners and
to go through so much stuff and I'm like
so I'm going to that with Laura today so
I'm so excited so I'm just gonna do my
normal everyday foundation routine that
I need for like longevity and last
ability let's go ahead and do the rest
of the base I'm took the hourglass
vanish stick of course classic go-to for
the coverage for the full coverage kunti
I cannot find my door I flash to save my
life
I make a
de la mer soft fluid liquid takes on
morphe m43 nine I'm just gonna buff this
into the skin
can't find my y6 right now but this
brush is amazing I love the way that our
glass lugs on my guards with the lemare
fluid gosh so much again you can see
that I have not really I tried it one
time but I really know much about it
this is the NARS soft back concealer in
the shade of vanilla I'm hoping this is
my shirt please please I'm taking on a
little morphe y11 oh that is stun that
is stun I mean honestly I'm
going to a drag queen finale so might as
well really go in
okay I'm living like I'm literally
living for this concealer and it's not
creasing super heavily on me or anything
it's super full coverage why not really
giving this a chance
hmm I'm sorry NARS goddamn let me set
the under eyes real quick because mommy
creases like a let's must
have something Helen you this is the
Urban Decay Naked skin
shapeshifter I have not yet tried this
out please work please so it's like half
our powders and the other half are
creams so we're just gonna go
white-handed our first to go over that
cream
okay cool it's light nothing crazy
for me I'm very much into a really soft
cream contour because I'm honestly just
using it as a base for my powders and
everything so this for me I'm actually
really really enjoying it okay we're
going to use this Babich a little morphe
quinine now to take this little a desert
shade it looks really cool toned which I
wanted to go for obviously more cool
tone oh I didn't realize how big we
could be work today oh my god this Tarte
palette is so crazy pigment in me
careful so you guys get oily in certain
places you can definitely use an
excessive amount of powder and just kind
of bake it into the skin
I get excessively oily in the t-zone
specifically color take the cover FX I
loose a setting powder and really set
that in place / literally everything
what do we have here Coco collection -
teen honestly released wanted to try
this blush out that look so pretty
be pigmented I don't like live breathing
die for her blushes or anything like
that but it's definitely a pretty color
and it pops up on my skin nicely now for
the highlight taking the Marc Jacobs do
you do drops I've never actually tried
this for I just want to taste a little
bit of it nervous oh that is so
beautiful very softly just pressing it
in with my little sponge I don't really
have any new highlighters backing use
the Kylie one I can use this bad boy
how's this one going to show up well
yeah hmm Shawn I think that was some
tender loving care
the kylieqq highlighters can look really
really pretty like definitely okay we
have the base on looking ready
I'm gonna go do my brows on camera
because I'm have any new brow products
and I'll be right back okay cool so we
have the brows on and their little thick
today little thicker than normal but I
was just kind of playing around messing
about the brow shape so not sisters
definitely not twins maybe not even
cousins but uh I got a new pad I wanted
playing clean this is the Urban Decay
Naked heat palette this has been so like
raved about intensely on social media
and it's been like a little bit of
controversy or revolving it saying that
the swatches weren't that good or
whatever so I wanted to play with it
right now and see what I think about it
I'm gonna use on the top of my eye and
do something more colorful on the bottom
on the lash line so I'm gonna take a
little bit the shade chaser and sawest
I'm gonna put that into the crease which
is like an icicle Oh warm pigmented s I
honestly really think the naked palettes
are really pretty like I have always
been a fan my favorite Naked palette
before this color scheme was in Naked 3
I loved the pink undertones of it and I
thought was so pretty so Bridal and very
like stunning guys guys the brushes I'm
using are morphe brushes most of them
it's just a funny because I've been like
caught up in morphe drama like recently
and it's so I don't even know it's just
like okay you guys want to hear the
 tea guess when you're the
 truth taking a low blow so me
and Laura we're going to the movie store
because we need to grab more of our
at morphe PHA is just the ones that we
use constantly like the ones that we
beat up because we use it so much and
travel with them and lose them and
things like that so I was like Laura
let's go to the morphe store and let's
freakin get some brushes because I need
some feels like dude I'm so down I need
some too so meal or I get there and we
are both looking around and we're
getting we're seeing the brushes that we
want to buy and things like that because
we got there and our intent was to buy
the brushes because I didn't warn morphe
that was coming over me Lord didn't say
anything we're just going over to
replenish and that was it because
usually with PR guys how PR usually
works like you don't a brain will send
you something and if you go through that
thing like that's it you don't get more
of it usually you have to go and buy
your own products like that's kind of
how PR works usually a bridal center for
the first time to give it to you as an
example like hey this is an you probably
came out with here you go if you go
through it then I can send you another
one unless you ask but I've never asked
for replenishments before so I'm like I
don't know if that works so we got there
like we cool it's like by our
brushes like let's do it so so were shot
being we're in the middle of getting our
brushes and we're like chatting or
taking photos with people at the morphe
store and shot to all the followers are
at the Marquee store that data I was
super fun to see you guys so I texted
Linda the owner of morphia to see if
she's there and my girl I'm here at the
morphe store are you here I would love
to see you love to chitchat and just
kind of Kiki and hang out so Linda is
there and were chit-chatting or talking
on my cake girl what's up how are you
we're just coming here to buy some
brushes you know you're like no you guys
don't buy anything here's more filly
it's like no and we're like okay like
we're not gonna I'm not gonna say no to
receiving free brushes I'm not gonna say
no to getting a free brushes well who
the would you say no to that no I'm
no I'm good no actually that's awesome
because I do promote your brand so I
really appreciate you guys getting more
brushes for free so that's what happened
so then I was like yeah of course take
some brushes and take some palette to
take some makeup if you guys want to for
a giveaway if you guys are planning a
giveaway soon take some pallets take
whatever you guys want to take I mean
they were like so me Laura was super
stoked because we were good able to get
pallets and other things like that for a
giveaway so we're like dude hell yes
thank you so much to learn from more
fees so at the end
Laura posted her receipt was like yes
but we went in and we did we did go and
we have like literally half the store in
our freaking bags after Linda comped us
we never said afterwards like oh we just
bought all this stuff we never said that
at the beginning when I first got there
and my snaps I was like yeah I'm gonna
buy some stuff because that's was the
plan was that's why you guys in here so
at the end being like oh my god we just
bought so many things we went in we said
we went in but we and said we bought
them because that's a lie
so I don't know I feel like you'll just
like a weird big misconception and I'm
like dude if they're soon
some drama can't be like something
that's like actually worth it like it
just felt so dumb and trivial I'm like
okay cool this is really like what we're
doing got it so this is what we're doing
right now with our free time this is
this is a drama quote-unquote drama that
we have two guys left like I don't
see the whole thing I wish I was more
juice to it but there really wasn't
that's all it was
I honestly I'm really liking this
palette guys like by the way like I
think it's looking so pretty and the
colors are really really nice and they
blend great and they're really pigmented
so I have nothing bad to say so far
about this palette the colors I've tried
which are chaser sauce low blow ashes so
far so freaking good so I'm liking it
I grabbed the morphe 35o when I was at
the store because I wanted some bold
colors we're just gonna have fun today
guys we're going to a drag show
toss some perps in there I saw this Pat
McGrath lab like a shadow astral white
pigment thing that I really wanted to
try out and put in my inner corner and
my lower lash line or swatches intent so
I'm hoping well that's so so pretty oh
my gosh
I love it I freaking love it okay go I'm
gonna go do my eyeliner off of camera
real quick and I'll be right back okay
grace I went ahead I do my liner and
lashes off of camera and I'm using the
kim tae lion-hearted lashes because i
freakin love them and like the most drag
paradigm they're not for the faint of
heart though they're for the line art
haha see what I did there so I'm think I
want to do a really nice pop of purple
in the waterline I'm gonna take this a
Marc Jacobs hi liner in the shade
grapevine oh that's so pretty okay great
so now I'm gonna do the lips and we'll
be done so I have here the collaboration
with color pop and Karen Aki left Sarah
E and I really really really wanted to
use a lip gloss lipstick from this
collection because I'm so so happy for
Karen I think Karen is seriously one of
the nicest sweetest people ever in like
the whole Beauty community she's so
great and wonderful she's so kind to
everyone
she's like a mean girl and she's not
like a bitch to anyone and it's so nice
to see because there's a lot of people
are like that that are mean is
 and she's not like that and it
makes me really happy so I really cannot
wait to try this collection out come
into the gloss because it looks so so
pretty okay I'm gonna take the lip liner
in the shade curvy curvy I love about
lip pencils so
this color is so cholita to me I
live live and I'm gonna take the ultra
glossy lip in the shade curvy as well
