today's video is going to be a full face
first impression basically most of my
faces are first impressions I decided to
combined a couple things that I tried
out a lot of different products a lot of
the stuff on my face is completely brand
new other than like my concealer I got a
bunch of pure recently and I went on
went shopping and I was like I'm going
to try out some of these products in a
video and just combined it all into one
so yeah today's video is going to be a
full things of first impressions try
things out for the first time I love
doing videos like this it really get to
show me like things that I love and
things that I fucking end up hating like

I absolutely love them but I'm stop
rambling because I'm kind of in a hurry

like a snail just drag the whole across
my hand and subscribe to my channel if
you weren't already and if you knew
what's up a man um you a and welcome to
my channel thank you so much for being
here let's go get started on today's a
full face of first impressions video
okay so let's go again start it on two
days of video and I decide I'm soon to a
full face of first impressions all the
products I have like I don't have
everything that's brand new like not
every single part of my face is gonna be
brand new because I mean they're just
not always makeup coming out all the
time i'ma try to use things that I don't
really use as often I'd have a lot new
shit but there's a lot of shit I don't
have that's new as well so we're just
gonna kind of just bear with me okay
bear with me yeah we're seeing someone
take the Smashbox photo finish primer I
have not used this in like two years
this is like a silicone II slippery
feeling primer it looks like a little
like jellyfish you were my squishy
you're my squishy and you'll be my
squishy Smashbox is like known for
beautiful primers or they say or when I
worked at Sephora that's what they were
known for since then they've done so
many amazing things but they were like
known for primers back in the day just
give me a nice like really slippery like
man or a back face you know like very
like ready that I was doing a poll on
Twitter and people were asked if you
guys wanted to see a full face using for
suppressions or if you want an expensive
foundation
and so many guys will just like just
combine them so I'm like fine like you
guys always just somehow win you guys
just win me over I'm always like okay
I'm returning to videos I'm gonna be
good
forget it like we're just we'll just do
it in this video this is the lemare the
soft liquid foundation SPF 20 so
Geoffrey actually was raving about this
foundation to me was like dude you have
to try this out it's absolutely amazing
and so with my friend Gaby aka Gabriel
Zamora here on YouTube they're both like
this is the best foundation I've ever
tried so I'm like okay so I am going to
be taking the lemare the soft liquid
foundation is the first time I'm trying
it which is why I was gonna do it first
impressions
it's like a very liquidy looks like a
really soft cover top taking 3 pumps
just to be thing and I'm at a con I
really flat packing brush like this ok
let's go and go in it matches my skin
pretty freakin nicely I'm in the shade
natural 12 oh my god this smells like
expensive it smells like rich woman they
were completely right with how beautiful
it looks on the skin it does look
absolutely beautiful look at that like
the way it builds in the way like it
gives you a nice beautiful medium
coverage okay I'm gonna take a one more
pump okay so that's four pumps oh it's
four pumps shit this foundation is a
hundred and ten dollars hundred ten
dollars so I'm gonna take this new Sigma
3d Beauty Blender it's like the weird
it's like the weirdest shaped thing ever
I'm gonna take a little bit on the note
I mean if the oh the splash feels very
very soft very bouncy I just think the
shape personally is a little odd like
I'm like what I I feel like it looks
like my skin but it gave me a really
nice amount of coverage where it's not
covering up like too much but it's
covering the just enough so I don't
really have a brand you can see that my
comic god I want to try this out so
badly so I'm gonna take the Urban Decay
Naked wait lists right up here
closes door I have like the darkness and
the darker circles and that's in the
shade light neutral but but I have
something new it has a moon this is the
YSL Touche Eclat
it's a brightening pen so we're gonna
use that to go underneath the concealer
and really brighten up the whole look
okay so we're gonna keep it at that eye
line it's a fucking hell
so I'm take that little 3db butter maybe
I'll do it on this
you'll join this idea and pounce it in
on a real note though I don't think I'm
liking the Sigma sponge feel like it's
almost like too soft and it's like
soaking up product let's do the
concealer and highlighter underneath our
like nice as hell and they look pretty I
don't think that is because of the
sponge by any means so now I'll be
taking the lemare the powder which is a
really has a down here and I'm gonna put
that underneath the eyes I'm put all
over the face really I'm a really cook
with this bad boy without anything I it
smells really oh that is so nice okay
now I'm gonna take the little puff that
it comes with which is literally like a
little fucking rabbit it's not actually
the rabbit - oh my god this is just a
little fluff I know a lot of makeup
artists that use this on their clients
delamare the powder it's so expensive
those like a hundred dollars to the
powder and I'm like what so the powder
and the foundation are starting to
settle in and honestly I think it looks
so ho so beautiful I take some powder
down the neck you guys know this Mac
Studio Fix I'm pretty pale on the neck
you know and I like to match my neck
color to my foundation color I love to
go dark with my foundation I don't know
I just do it just enough to be more tan
if I wanted to match my face to my neck
I would but I like being a little bit
more tuned yeah so I don't really have a
new bronzer or contour color someone
took a little bit of my classic Marc
Jacobs tantric bronzer do you want
really crazy guys right now is that like
I mean this is like it ready lez just
fucking chat I just feel like it's so
crazy right now how YouTube is turning
into this like crazy like let's make
videos about people and drag them place
it's so so sad like I started YouTube
but almost almost three years ago maybe
two and a half years ago and back then
it wasn't like that you know now there's
like all these like counts that are
wanting to you know bash people and like
try to change people's opinions on them
and it's seriously like the saddest
thing to me I'm always somehow involved
in some type of drama it makes me
actually fuckin cackle a little bit
because it's like people don't know you
and they don't want to know you like
they don't want to make an effort to get
you to you because then if they like you
like all the things I said are in vain
but it's just something that I've been
noticing that like people really love to
jump on the bandwagon and talk so much
shit about different youtubers and then
people also want to pretend like they've
never done
thing wrong in their whole life that's
the sad part to me it's like dude really
you're gonna you're gonna pretend to be
this innocent ask angel like completely
innocent you've never done a thing wrong
in your whole life got it out of me I
just like it's sad because um if you're
a youtuber and you have a youtube
account that is dedicated to trying to
expose them quote-unquote expose them
and like make people realize who they
really are
that's just like so sad to me dude
honestly especially cuz a lot of time
it's just like this crazy biased opinion
and it's like not it's not even real and
it's like all these false accusations
and it's so sad like how did you to turn
into this you know how did it turn into
people pretending to be perfect calling
out those who aren't bitch if you're
watching this and you're a hater of mine
and you hate me and you want to make a
video about me you are not perfect
either and I know I'm not perfect and I
don't preach being perfect but these are
countering to sit back make videos about
other people talking about how imperfect
they are when they're obviously not
perfect themselves it's just like really
weirds me out you know what I mean like
it's just like really calling the kettle
black in this situation and it's
something and it's fucking sad like what
how about you focus on creating content
like for your own self and not relying
on others for your content maybe that's
just what I'm saying okay guys let's go
in with a new highlighter from jeffree
star cosmetics this is in the shade
Siberian gold and I've been wanting this
fucking Shana's like Jeffrey please what
if I bought me huh what if I bought you
guys I saw this color like a while back
and I was so beyond obsessed with it so
I was like Jeffrey come out with it
already like I'm dying to play with this
so we'll take some Siberian gold oh my
if you're lighter in complexion like I
am um I would suggest Siberian Gold over
like King Tut King Tut is like his other
gold highlighter which is so beautiful
as well but on me like it would anything
like work as well as this one does this
one is just like BAM like fucking van
like a shop I want a mm-hmm
and this is so far the base guys and I'm
loving how it's looking oh my gosh look
so like it just looks really I'm looking
the definer enuf sorry it just looks
really soft and like lightweight and not
so heavy like I'm used to on the face I
honestly think it looks absolutely
beautiful and if it's precisely my brow
pencil
I like to do the bottom of the brow
first and just kind of carve out do you
know I wish YouTube was right now I wish
that the the thing wasn't exposing
youtubers I wish it was about supporting
and I wish it was about unity you know
what I mean like that's right that's
what I really wish YouTube was right now
like that's all I was in the past I
think like years ago there was no like
drama channel there was no gossip like
there was nothing like that you know it
was just like fun creating content just
for fun and for the love of creating
content you know and now I feel like
it's turned into this really just sad
vicious jealous place the assumptions is
what like really fucks with people you
know like when you make assumptions and
people make videos about people and it's
like your whole focus is trying to
change someone else's opinion about me
like doesn't that just sound so intense
it makes people not want to create
content because fear of backlash or even
people like wanting to make any jokes
like people don't want to make any jokes
anymore because they're scared they're
gonna offend someone it's the truth
people will get offended nowadays like
with literally anything even if it's
something that's not really offensive
someone can easily find offense to it
and it becomes a whole situation and
it's like wow that was what your focus
was was trying to get offended by
something I said okay instead of trying
to focus on other people on other
youtubers and other people's lives why
not try to focus and better yourself and
better your own life and I say this like
out of a loving place I really do like
because when I first started YouTube I
was so focused on other people like
doing better than me and it's kind of
hard not to get kind of consumed in that
when you're first starting YouTube you
know like you play this like comparison
game and you're like yo why am I not
growing like them this is so crazy like
what like am i doing something wrong is
my content not as good like what's the
issue but after a while you come to
realize that that's not what's important
you know like creating own entity and
creating your own persona is so much
more important than trying to focus on
other people so hard you don't like I
would I wouldn't like watch other
youtubers like other friends of mine and
I would be like damn man like your
content is so great and I could never
make content like you and no one will
ever watch my videos like you and I was
so discouraged because I would compare
myself so much but there's literally no
point in comparing because everyone is
completely different even like someone
that you're best friends with like
Jeffrey Jeffrey's my best friend but he
and I are so
vastly different it's the craziest thing
but I feel like our differences
complement one another you know and it's
like we both pick up my mannerisms that
the other do it just like how it is like
when you have a best friend you just say
shit that they say and that's your
friendship because you guys are fucking
weird and you guys do shit together and
it's just fun but on YouTube it turns
into oh my god you're just copying that
person you're trying to be them like
stop get your head out of his ass you
know what I mean and it's so funny
because that's not what it is what it is
just actual genuine friendship and
camaraderie but on YouTube it turns into
this dark mean thing that people just
want to assume people just want to say
vicious things and I don't know why like
I don't know why I don't know why it's
like that and I'm just like generally
talking right now I'm not like being
like oh my god what was me play I'm the
fucking victim like none and that I'm
just stating when I'm noticing you know
I mean like as a youtuber so when that
does YouTube for a full-time living I
just something I've been noticing in the
YouTube community recently and it's like
just so frustrating not only is this get
ready a fucking first impression this is
a fucking event session
I just wanna vent to you guys and just
chit chat you know another thing I
really get frustrated with people like
always talking about the past and always
talking about how what an evil person
someone was in the past or all the
things that they did that were in the
past you know as if someone can't learn
and grow from that
that's also what frustrated me so much
do I was like a little fucking shit and
it's just funny because like when I was
20
like 19 20 21 I was so angry and I would
say the meanest shit to people I didn't
care about nothing I just cared about
what how I felt it's because I was angry
inside you know I was angry I was angry
at people I was ingredient my parents I
was angry at being gay you know and I'm
25 now and it's like looking back and
that old me you know at the old Manny
and I want to be something else so bad I
want to be something else so bad I would
be so bummed if someone saw that old me
and like judge me so hard on that person
like Who I am now you know because it's
like that's not who I am now anymore
like I had to deal with those moments in
the past to be able to be the person I
am today wasn't more of like an asshole
little fucking bitch back then yeah I
was you know I totally was but I really
wouldn't change that experience because
it's made me who I am today and I really
love who I am today and I know a lot of
people hate on me and a lot of people
wanna drag me and write like that whole
fucking that whole scene and that's them
man like that's all on them if they have
like inner demons you got to be me like
that's all that's on you but I haven't
finally learned to just really live the
way I want to live and live life how I
want to live it and not be so worried
about what other people think about me
for such a long time I was trying to
play this perfect character you know I
was trying to be this perfect person
growing up the way I grew up and um
being the firstborn and being like I
have to set the example and I was this
perfect child and I got straight A's in
I've in sports and I went to Junior
Olympics and I was like this star child
I played this role for so long trying to
just people please my whole entire life
just people pleasing me my life finally
I came to realize that that's like
that's not what's important you know
being who you are being yourself is
what's important and that's something I
wanted to YouTube with me you know I
want to take my newfound freedom and
liberation to YouTube and be like oh
this is who I am and if you don't like
me don't fucking watch it I'm grateful
for YouTube for pushing me to be better
that's what I'm grateful for you know
I'm grateful that YouTube pushed me to
be someone that I always wanted to be
but never really could be you know what
I mean that's kind of what I was that's
not that's what I'm grateful for with
YouTube for sure random side note I'm
taking Mac painterly paint-pot I've
never tried this before everyone always
talks about this I'm like I'm gonna try
this out oh okay this is looking pretty
nice I like totally knocks out all your
like discoloration and vain eNOS and
weirdness on your lids huh don't want to
be below the heat so for the eyes I
think I'm gonna take this crazy ass
violet boss Pro palette look how many
colors are in here this is crazy I'm
just gonna do a classic mani look so I
want to try out some new other things as
well one thing I will say about this I
don't really like the packaging of this
I think it just looks like really I
don't know like I just I'm not I'm not a
fan of the packaging whatsoever but I do
like violet wash shadows I think they
work very very nicely so I'm gonna go on
with a couple of these neutrals on the
side and do a nice just chill look okay
some take a little bit of this shade
Abigale on a more for you 27 I'm gonna
put that into the crease just as a nice
just base we're going to chill down on
the crease as a base these shadows blend
out very very nicely they're so easy to
blend like everything it just looks
seamless it's a very easy color to blend
out it's a very very nice chill palette
to use
I'm just gonna be using like really
mostly Browns in this video because I
want to use like something glitter on
the lid with that steel of stuff you
know I'm going with that so I'm gonna
take a little bit of Alice maybe Alice
and Josie I'm gonna put that on the
outer corner and into the crease this is
really gonna be mostly just a brown a
soft brown look I'm gonna take a little
bit of Stila Magnificent metals glitter
and glow shadows I've never tried these
before
I tried them like on my hand and swatch
them at Jeffrey's but it's not the same
as trying them on your eyes so let's see
how they work whoa so take a look it's a
liquid that was the fastest application
of shot I think I've ever done how do

Jacobs matte highlighter pencil in the
shade
Dasia blue so Glen absolutely beautiful

lashes off of camera and I'll be right

and the audio was turned off during this
portion so I took the eye lower lashes
platinum princess in collaboration with
Vegas nay they're a beautiful wispy pair
with a mink effect they're absolutely
amazing and then when I went ahead I did
I took the MAC lipstick in the shade so
me I believe it was and it's a liquid
lipstick one of their new ones that they
came out with and I think it's so
beautiful
it's literally gorgeous in the formulas
so much better than what it was so I was
very very very impressed and that's what
the lip looked like I was being all
Posey and cute thinking I was hot shit
