today's video is going to be the first
like tutorial or like first type of fall
look that I'm gonna be doing this season
I'm so excited I love fall time so much
it's my favorite time of the year I just
figured it'd be really fun to film a
tutorial recently I uploaded a video and
I was actually with Laura in in Laura
and I were testing Instagram makeup are
things that were really really popular
on Instagram things that you saw all
over Instagram like the Too Faced
collection and things like that me and
her we're talking and it just kind of
being candid and just kind of talking
one on one and nowadays it feels like
tutorials are kind of going away and
we're really into like this review stage
of YouTube right now cuz when you upload
a tutorial on YouTube it people don't
get as many views as you do when I can
you're doing a review on something weird
or doing some random-ass video and it's
just something I've noticed I don't know
exactly what it is but I figured you
know what Bucky I saw so many comments
of you guys saying please do a tutorial
soon and I figured why the not and
I just got the huda beauty palette
recently said the desert desk palette
looks like this it's stunning
holy it's beautiful and I thought
it'd be really really really fun to film
a grungy smoky very fall type look oh
yeah guys that's what I was going to be
were gonna film a tutorial I have not
tried who the beauty's palette yet I've
heard mixed reviews I'm not really
exactly sure what I'm getting myself
into right now but I'm excited to film
it as always if you guys like this video
if you guys do not like me please don't
 watch it you know like your
thing but if you guys do you like this
video please subscribe to my channel if
you're not already and if you're new
what's up I'm an emu a and welcome to my
channel thank you as so much for being
here I really appreciate it but yeah
let's go and get into this a grungy
small I don't know what the we're
gonna I'm just gonna pull out the
palette and just
I was kind of walking around with the
pallet earlier and I was watching when
they swatched really really really
nicely the mats felt creamy the shimmers
felt intense there's one shade right
here this is in the shade Cosmo and this
is straight-up a pressed glitter I
didn't really like it only touched it it
felt very like gritty and intense and I
was like yeah so we're not gonna use
that but we're gonna use other shades I
kind of want to go in with some Purple's
in oranges and reds and do something
really fall and desert dusky if you know
I'm singing so we're gonna take the
shade desert sand but they're very
powdery so far as I've noticed I'm as
I'm like going into it but they're not
crazy powdery where your overwhelms or
anything like that they're just powdery
and then I'm taking this on a morphe 27
it's a really nice fluffy brush great
for like throwing in transition shades
and things like that so I'm just going
to be doing this and putting this into
the crease it's just a nice easy
transition something neutral to put down
first to blend out this is fun I haven't
actually done like a full like
talk-through
tutorial or like something like this in
a while and I have missed it a lot I
definitely definitely have but watch
this video like not get that
many views just because we're like not
in a tutorial world right now and I
think it's because so many people have
seen tutorials done like you can only
use so many color combinations you can
only do so many different types of
things before people just get bored you
know at least when you're doing a review
it's like a new type of thing it's like
something weird and new and I think
that's the aspect that people are enjoy
and they're liking to see like something
different and unique what do you guys
think I'm really like this is genuinely
a curious thing for me because I'm just
like kind of talking right now and just
opening up like how it is on my side of
youtube links seeing how things go yeah
I would love to hear your guys's
thoughts on this I don't know maybe I'm
tripping maybe I'm I don't know
what I'm singing but let me know what
you guys think so now I'm gonna take the
shade amethyst and saffron and mix the
shades together it's like a purpley
purple and red combined and we're gonna
put that with a morphe art 39 it gets
like a dense packing a fluffy brush if
that makes sense like a white haired
brush so we're gonna put that on the
outer corner don't do something more fun
today it's like I'm actually later on
I'm going to Universal Studios to do
this Access Hollywood thing with Laura
we're doing like a maze thing through
that this scary maze and they're like
gonna film it and I'm like so
scared okay I don't so I'm like praying
that it's not that scary you guys so as
I'm going in and blending right now I
feel like the shadows are blending fine
like I'm not like really having too much
problem when it comes to the blend but I
do think that there's a lot
kickback when it comes to these shadows
the lighter ones had more like right now
these guys don't have as much
I mean honestly for me like whenever a
shadow has a lot of kickback as long as
it blends and like I can use it and it's
okay like I'm fine like I don't care if
they're like some fallout actually I
think I spoke too soon because I feel
like this part here it's not blending
very easily but I know when it comes to
like purples and reds those shades are
so hard to like blend out once they go
down like trust me I know I know about
those shades and they are very
very very hard to blend out once they
are down okay so far so good and
everything is blended out as much as we
can when it comes to these kind of
colors do a little bit more of a harder
concentration of that amethyst color on
that same r39
I feel very like Sarah Jessica Parker in
 hocus-pocus
she's like the purple one it's actually
so funny even saying that because last
year me Patrick and Chris P all did a
hocus pocus video and it was so much fun
we did a collaboration and all of us
like were the Sanderson sisters and I
was actually served disco Parker why
should we take next the shade Twilight
is speaking to me this is what it looks
like we're hearing that is speaking
to me what about the shade Turkish
Delight okay I'm gonna do both it
I'm doing both I mean we'll see if it
turns out I'm lay just kind of
around I'm gonna take the shade Turkish
Delight all right put that all over the
center of the lid give us of that little
that warm pop that we're getting I feel
like with these shadows these are
definitely ones that you need to apply
with your finger because they're just
like really almost like wet feeling I
don't know it's kind of weird so now I'm
gonna go over it with that Twilight
chain right over the top of it whoo it's
literally so intense the camera cannot
even pick it up how gnarly this
looks in person whoo this look sickening
I have some follow on my face just the
heads out careful with oh wow okay I'm
gonna do the other eye off of camera and
I'll be right back okay so so far this
is what we got you guys this is how it
looks I think it's looking
sickening I'm really really liking all
this is turning out actually so um that
makes me quite happy look at that
you guys and honestly because this is a
grungy ER tutorial you guys don't need
to be like so intense about getting it
like perfectly right it's all good I
just wanted it to be like kind of blown
out and intense looking so I'm gonna
take the shade out
oh you d out on a morphe 35n cyl brush
will work great for this but I'm going
to just put that on the outer corner I
really start to define the
corner a little bit more because it is a
little bit like looking I'd only see a
lot of color coming up with this one
that's weird
okay I see it like I mean I see it's not
like intense and they'll take a little
bit of black too
okay I can definitely see it now that
there is definitely some there's
definitely a darker Brown shout him down
okay cool I can see it now and then just
taking that 827 is blending out the
edges a little bit more you can never
blend too much girl you know just blend
toadstools okay so now for the bottom of
the lash line I just want to really
again smoke it out make it just like
grungy and intense I'm gonna take the
Marc Jacobs high liner in the shade at
rokoko Ohio
 love the shade rokoko and I
blend that into a waterline well this
makes my eyes look so intense and so
pretty if you're looking for a really
good eyeliner for the waterline for
hazel eyes or for blue eyes try rokoko
by Marc Jacobs because luckily the
highliners are pretty creamy I don't set
too fast
mm-hmm okay now what she should be going
with next we take the shade royal like a
satin purple finish so what it looks
like on the skin right there sui down on
the lower lash line I feel like it'll
tie the look together really nicely to
make it a lot more purple intense so
we're gonna take the shade royal are
gonna blend out that rokoko shade right
down here like that yeah yes honey
one grungy I just love like looks like
this I try my best not to grab any
oranges because you guys know I love
with an orange and I love a really warm
smoky eye yeah I'm just gonna take that
r39 that we use to blend everything out
earlier and just blend out that lower
lash line a little bit just to give us a
little bit of a better blend I'm taking
a little bit of the shade angelic on my
fingertip and put that whoa on the inner
corner I was not expecting to look that
intense we're really going for that
grungy look I guess this is so intense
 but I live for it okay guys I'm
gonna go curl my lashes and put some
eyeliner on off of camera and I'll be
right back
okay guys so this is what we should have
so far so off of camera what I did to
make this Center pop a little bit more I
took the Stila Magnificent metals and
glitter and glow liquid shadow in the
shade see siren it's like a duochrome
purple blue shade you do not have to do
that of course at all I just wanted to
add a little bit more of a pop because I
am going out later on tonight and I
thought would look really really really
cool with it as a shade was so
to the lid shade and I think it looks
 sickening I took the same r39
brush took out my shadow underneath here
and just blended it out just and just
kept it going okay guys for the lip I
think I'm gonna take the show you -
steela note a and ot te I've never tried
to shake it but it looks really pretty
and I think it would go really cool with
this well that's so much darker than I
thought it was cool Wow oh wow hmm
application on this kind of color is so
scary cushy though oh let it
dry because I just got a little bit
patchiness because I didn't like dragon
time this color stunning though Wow and
that is it you guys and that's it for
today's grungy tutorial I just wanted to
do something fun and different you know
I don't really ever do too many colors
like this I don't ever do lip colors
like this I don't really do eye looks as
much like this actually do I looks like
this was like kind of like my thing I
love doing smoked out really intense on
the eyelid really grungy looking eyes
but it's just like what I like to do and
it's fun but the lip definitely not no
not at all but the color is really
beautiful you have to be careful though
when it's drying because it will become
patchy on you if you try to do that I
think it's pretty good on the coverage
right now it looks pretty good there's
definitely some spots of like right
there there patchiness but I think that
you can definitely get by with the
lipstick for sure and I think the look
turned out really sickening I
hope you guys enjoy today's video I had
a lot of fun and just sitting down and

fun tutorial I haven't done one of these
