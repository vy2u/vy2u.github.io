today's video I am beyond excited to
film this right now I'm so fucking shook
as you guys have seen I already posted
my video showing you guys my life's a
drag a color palette and I'm so stoked
about it as you guys know I'm like
geeked
I'm gagged I'm freaking the fuck out
about it sorry I feel so flushed and so
like overwhelmed right now because like
the fact that the videos out is like
really overwhelming for me and this
video I'm actually filming before I
actually put the video that's going live
out because I wanted to film that makeup
I'm wearing in that video is it does
that make sense I'm like kind of talking
inception right now but anyway I'm so
excited to film this something I've been
working on for years now is coming to a
realization and you guys actually are
seeing what it is I want to do a
tutorial using my electric palette I
felt you guys that's exactly what you
guys want to see you guys want to see me
actually using and I want to do it my as
my first tutorial I want to do something
that's really really wearable maybe not
so like wearable but definitely
something that's more on the neutral
side rather something that's so bold I'm
gonna add a pop of color in it just so I
can show you guys how easy it is to
incorporate color into your everyday
looks just guys like that would be
really really really cool to do and I
would want to show you guys how exactly
I do it let me I want to like copper I
look like I want to do something that's
really really beautiful I think that's
very very me and just so you guys know
like how easy it is to do something
really really easy and neutral and
simple but also vamp it up a little bit
with some color or if you want to just
wrap it up in general make it darker who
knows that's what today's video is going
to be as always if you guys don't like
this video if you guys do not like me
please i'm fuckin watch it you know the
joe with that but you guys do like this
video please go and click subscribe to
my channel if you're not already and if
you're new what's up Manny anyway and
welcome to my channel thank you so much
for being here for the bottom of my
heart you watching this means so much to
me because it's literally like my first
tutorial using my palette and I feel
really overwhelmed sir if I'm like kind
of slipping up on my words if I'm acting
a little bit different this has just
been something that I've been working on
for so long and I'm really just scared
you know I'm scared and I'm nervous and
I'm excited and I'm every emotion I can
possibly even think of right now you
know this is just gonna be tutorial I
already did all the details on my
previous video which I will link down
below all the details about the palette
itself but yeah that's gonna get right
into it
so we're gonna go right in we're gonna
do a really just pretty everyday
dramatic look can I even say everyday
dramatic like who is excited I have a
double-ended brush in the pan
this one I've used a lot more and it's
been washed so that's why it's kind of
flared out a little bit becomes more
tapered I promise you I always feel like
I want like a good quality brush in a
palette and so that's why I feel like we
really got with this one place a Ellis
I'm excited right now we're not gonna
use my brush exactly so I wanted to take
a big fluffier brush to use something
more transitioning so I'm gonna take the
shade sickening sickening yeah I don't
see that autumn orpheum 504 and I'm
gonna zoom in of course as you guys know
sickening is a really pretty warm orange
e transition go ahead and dip right into
it I just do two dabs and that's plenty
like that's plenty product for me this
feels so weird sorry using this but I've
been hiding it for so long for this look
we're gonna put it right into the crease
sickening is literally like that bitch
you know so I'm mixing in the shade
hunty with it as well just to kind of
make my own custom transition shade
sickening is a really warm transition
and hunty is a very cool transition so I
kind of wanted to mix them both and just
create your own custom transition shade
the shadows blend so fucking nicely like
I'm so so happy I mean fuck years of
working hard at something really does
pay off and it's like the coolest thing
in the whole world to actually see
something that you've been vision for so
long come to life and actually be
sickening I would never like allow it to
like not be great be sickening see
that's what it looks like right there
it's deadly more on the warm side I use
definitely more sickening than hunty but
everything else my fans you know I'm
saying so now I'm gonna go in with my
little brush that it comes with the
palette and I'm gonna take this shade a
trade
mmm this color gives me the feels like I
love this color so much is basically
like a warm berry shade it's like a warm
maroon shade it's so beautiful that's
gonna go on the outer corner I'm just
gonna lightly dab that on ooh and that's
gonna go blend it into the crease as
well start deepening of that crease a
little bit oh the shade is so beautiful
oh my gosh and just blend that into the
crease a little bit right there
basically we just made it extremely
extremely warm and more intense and this
is exactly like the kind of look I go
for it honestly it blends so easily you
see that shit do you lose your shit My
Goddess now I'm gonna go and take the
shade legendary which is the gold
glittery foiled shade preference wise I
think that these foiled shades these
Glary foiled shades just go on
so much better with a finger I felt you
need a really really dense dense packing
situation also that's why I did a
packing side of this brush we can't take
this brush of course as well and I'm
gonna run it in two legendary as well
and you can see that the brush gets
coated really nicely but I personally
think that the effect is so much more
there when you use a finger that's just
my personal opinion or you can always
spray this of course with fix+ which
will do I'll just show you guys what it
looks like as well I'm gonna go ahead
and put that onto the lid so my finger
that's why I'm not using my finger now
that means you can see like you just get
more of the effect there as you can see
it's like more foiled this gold is
literally hmm like I don't even have any
words for it honestly it's just liquid
gold ain't kidding so we have so far
we're gonna add a pop of color now on
the lower lash links I just feel like
when you're adding up a pop of color in
the lower lash line it's not as
intimidating because it is the lower
part of your eye it's not as much of a
focus as like the top of your eye is
right you know for example a little sign
so actually go and take the shade a
pageant queen which is the beautiful
stunning purple shade a little dip goes
such a long way you don't need that much
I'm gonna run that in my lower lash
thinks I wanted to do a pop of color her
her her her taking that same brush that
the palette comes with and we're just
pushing that into the lower lash line
y'all pressing to get the ultimate color
payoff from yuria up here as well a
little bit I'm just taking a clean brush
I'm just blending underneath it because
we can still have that nice soft
transition on the lower lash line
and then I'm gonna add a little bit of
black as well just to really intensify
it a bit more so that's gonna take our
black shade shady shady Queen and we're
gonna go ahead and run that on the lower
lash line as well as into the little
crease area to really just deepen da da
we recently just intensifying the purple
and that is what black will do it will
intensify every single shade that it's
around or it's added to that no more
feet II 36 just a little something I'm
gonna mirror this black up here as well
fuck that's a good black I do say so
myself I cause tell myself I'm gonna do
something really natural today with this
look natural hair bitch you see I can
turn down the brightness a little bit
doesn't actually see what it looks like
a little bit more Kunis you know she
like it looks a little bit more clear
when I have the brightness down slightly
so hope you guys can see what it looks
like a little bit better so I was
overexposed this is her hug dude but
that's good
let's go ahead and pack on some Haley
I'm actually gonna take the shade beets
and this is like the really pretty
shimmery champagne pink shade and I
don't put on the inner corner of my eye
as my highlight because god damn god
damn mm-hmm a little bit on my brow bone
as well you guys so this is the one I
completed so quick so easy I literally
did this in what 15 minutes not even 15
minutes so I did this in like 10 minutes
like I did this so quickly because the
shadows are so fucking easy to use
they're so fucking great let's actually
take a little bit of beet and let's
highlight without a little bit too why
not okay no Emma's literally gonna go in
with my like highlighting brush see this
doesn't anything I'm just kidding I know
it does something because I've used that
highlight before and you guys just
haven't known yet okay I'm gonna go
finish the other eye on camera and I'll
be right back okay guys so this is what
the eye looks like right here completed
with some eyeliner and some lashes that
Lily lashes Miami on of course and this
is the final I look right here I'm gonna
zoom in a little bit I feel like I
should put some flash on top on the
phone and see what it looks like you
know see the glitter in the sheen you'll
see that shit the goal has so much
glitter and it's like micro reflect
glitter it's like insanity yeah yeah
yeah you guys that's it for today's
video this is my first tutorial using my
life's a drag pallets it's funny because
I said in the beginning video I'm gonna
do a copper eye nude lip but this look
I'm not doing any kind of copper eye at
all and I did something like golden
purple and maroon I don't know where I
went with that but honestly that's the
cool thing about this palette you can
like think you're gonna do something but
you're so inspired by other colors that
are in the palette that you just kind of
take it to somewhere else and it always
ends up being so much more fun that way
cuz you're inspired by something like
looking at him just so much more
inspired to incorporate color than just
being like basic mani like all the time
so I took a little bit of a color turn
but uhm I think it turned out
fantastically and I absolutely loved it
and I'm so so proud of this palette and
I'm so excited that to be available on
this Saturday like I'm so so excited so
fucking nervous hey are you guys this is
