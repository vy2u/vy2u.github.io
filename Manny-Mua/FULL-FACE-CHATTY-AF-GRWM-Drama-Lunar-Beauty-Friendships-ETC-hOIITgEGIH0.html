just get really real
let's just get really fucking oh yeah
okay let's get fucking deep what are
your guys's new year's resolutions and
I'm being dead ass like real ones I
wouldn't you tell me some real ones I
want you to tell me some fucking like
like some little ones like you're just
like randomly making up right now I
wanna hear you guys you're being serious
are you doing any New Year's resolutions
are you taking them seriously like what
is gonna be your new year's resolution
for 2018 like I literally like we are
starting the new year off we're starting
it strong we want to start a strong and
I feel like it's gonna be a fantastic
fucking year if you make it fantastic I
want on this whole fucking snapchat rant
about how I think that just because a
new here is happening does not mean that
the world owes you anything basically if
you want things to change for yourself
in a new year you have to make them
fucking happen yeah make them come to
life you know what I mean as soon as you
start thinking that the world owes you
something
it's one's problems start to arise and
I'm being dead ass serious on this like
this is like something this is gonna be
some like fucking life advice video ok
we're gonna talk about some life burning
a really fucking real
I'm just kidding I get that real bit
like hello like kind of real you know
when you start um we start to think that
the world owes you something is when
shit go down heal and I mean it in the
most like nicest way possible I just
mean that in the way of like yo you need
to work your ass off in this life to
make the best life possible for yourself
you know what I mean you can't just
expect shit to fall in your lap because
what you're pretty you've got a hard
life etc etc etc okay you can't think
that you need to take life by the
fucking balls so for me this year is
going to be a big year because one lunar
Beauty is launching that's my biggest
like holy fucking tits shit cocksucking
like intensity you know that's my
biggest thing I'll talk about that more
later in case you guys don't know I
announced on Christmas that I'm gonna be
coming out with a brand this year and
its name is lunar Beauty which is like
so me which is favoring me and I'm just
so excited that's that it's finally like
announced and Alan about and finally I
can just like say the name you know even
just saying the name had given me so
much anxiety for the past like year like
being like just nervous you just never
know with things like this you never
know people gonna take it well you never
know people are gonna see your vision
but at the end of the day you need to be
confident yourself and you need to make
you fucking work I'm gonna be taking
yours resolutions seriously this year
like I never do by the way I never do
I'm wanting to this year I really wanna
I just really want to I want to make my
life better
yeah so for me first resolutions just go
and talk about first ones I don't have a
nicer body I really do I really want to
focus more on working out on me I want
to focus more on eating healthy mind you
yes I had KFC today cuz freshly hasn't
been delivering over the holidays okay
let a bitch live I make my thanks huh
everyone has of days I want to be
healthier that's a definite definite
definite goal of mine is to be healthier
this year because who doesn't want to be
healthy I wanna be able to take off my
shirt in public I've never been
comfortable that never not once in my
entire life they comfortable that nice
still not I'm not there yeah I'm not
comfortable to y'all my shirt public I
usually will not do it unless I'm in a
very very very enclosed situation or
it's like friends around me only friends
and I trust I'm very particular about it
I'm very against security easily about
my body you know and are you more
confident this year you know with my
body and I actually have to do things
what do you have things they want to
change about your body that's something
you need to actually go out and do like
this that's something that you're like
bitch get the fuck up off the fucking
couch and off the bed you guys know I
love to nap and get to the gym go do
some cardio get some fucking weight
lifting and like do something and it
will make a huge difference
here is gonna be different I'm going to
be gonna be better that's one of my
biggest goals of 2018 is just to be
healthier you know be more confident
myself try my hardest to be more out
there
that's going into my next one I want to
be more bored I want to be really really
forward in at 2018 you know I'm not have
a single dude you know and it's it's
cool it's whatever I don't like mind but
I want to be like you can't just assume
shits gonna fall into your life like for
example you can't assume like you're
gonna find a boyfriend to find love if
you're just sitting there fuckin
totalling your thumbs you know you have
to actually like go out and try like you
don't you have to try to make things
happen for yourself
and I'm not saying over here like I'm
gonna go every fucking weekend and go to
the fucking Club and mean like doing you
know I'm not gonna do any I'm not gonna
do any of that so I just think that
putting yourself out there more you know
just be more open to the possibilities
that's like what I'm trying to say is I
want to be more open to possibilities of
finding someone I'm giving people a
chance like go on dates more like say
yes to dates more no Hale people I've
hit on a couple people actually like
recently and it's worked out me I mean
then we're like work out and like my
exact favor you know and just turned up
into like a hookup which is fine I guess
but in 2018 I want to focus more on like
making more positive connections with
men I mean of course I hook up is
positive it's cool experience but like I
thought what do you mean I wanted to be
like a something meaningful that make
sense so I'm gonna attempt to be a
little bit more forward it doesn't he
know try to be you know that bitch I see
someone at the gym like that's fine as
fuck why not just be like hey you're
super handsome before I let you know
like what is wrong with that you know I
get so nervous too cakey so my head
doing this shit and I'm like fuck I want
to be able to say that kind of stuff
like what why am I being sick when I get
into my head and I'm like okay well I'm
not executing them so obviously I'm not
gonna like that it's not gonna go out in
my favor like they're not gonna they're
gonna be like what the fuck look like
you know I'm saying like I feel like I
get into my head like that I'm sure a
lot of people would get do too and it's
so easy to fall into like oh well
they're just gonna like laugh at me and
walk away you know but I'm like at the
end of the day like people aren't rude
like I mean hopefully you'd get you
wouldn't say hi to someone they're like
hey don't someone that was rude and if
they were rude then at least you know
then you aren't continuing on anything
with them I want to get people the
benefit of the doubt and last resolution
that I have is leaving people that don't
want to be in my life in 2017 if you
don't want to be in my life if you don't
want to fucking fuck with me if you
don't want to be my friend if you don't
want to be any of if you don't like hang
out with me do any lots of that is
totally fine but I'm tired of trying to
be that bitch that always is the one
that's trying
you know what I mean like I'm tired of
it and I'm gonna leave mani who's a
people-pleaser or at least I'm gonna try
as much as I can in 2017 is well I'm
gonna try to be more confident and more
confident in myself and not feel like I
need to be friends with everyone
growing up you guys that was what my
biggest struggles was trying to make
everyone like me it was so hard and so
stressful I never want to go back to
that you know now luckily I'm at a point
where it's like does it still affect me
sometimes yes it does I don't think that
will ever leave me is wanting people
like me always like me you know I live
my life on social media too I always
want to like feel like people are
enjoying my company or enjoying my
content and things like that you know I
never want to be the bitch that's like
come on give a fuck like not give a fuck
ever but I definitely want to be the
bitch that's not like consumed with
getting people to like them that was my
whole MO my whole fucking life was
literally trying to get to people to
like me and doing whatever it took to
get to make it happen you know I need to
think more highly of myself and be more
confident within my own fucking ability
and my friendship and myself as a person
and not let people take advantage of me
or if they're rude to me I thought you
guys don't understand help many issues
I've had out in events with different
influencers who I used to be friends
with or I used to be acquaintances with
or whatever the fuck and they treated me
like such a fucking dick at an event and
honestly I would just weep it under the
rug and just think like oh maybe they're
having a bad day or maybe they just like
didn't see me I was come up with so many
fucking excuses for people's mean
actions or rude actions towards me I'm
not doing this again I'm not doing this
again it doesn't 18 I'm sorry I'm not
I'm fucking over it and if you want to
be a fucking dick to me cool but now I'm
not gonna I'm not gonna be the bigger
person sounds terrible sounds really
terrible I'm not gonna be the one that's
going to be going off to people at
events I mean like hi I'm trying I want
to be stronger I'm tired of being
treated like shit at certain events so
certain people and like you know what I
don't need to go up and say hi to you
and I'm no longer going to I don't know
maybe that's like the wrong my set to be
in it could be honestly it really could
be but I think I'm just tired of being
let down I'm not changing when it comes
to like who I am as a core person I'm
just tired of being walked all over so
that's kinda what I mean I want you guys
thinking like oh my god man II didn't
turn into a fucking big I need to take
care of myself first and sometimes it's
like hard to realize that and I've had
realization so I'm like fuck man stop
letting people worry because you want to
be light taking a pause retained Kristin
Lee an ex Urban Decay Kristin Leon is
also another a beauty blogger vlogger on
here on YouTube and she came out with
the collection with freakin Urban Decay
that is amazing so I want to take some
of her items today and use them in
today's video just so cute just like so
unique and like look how fucking cool
this is with the little bubbles and then
we get highlighters yes bitch we can't
see we have this one this one and we
have this one all beautiful like they're
beautiful and they feel very very smooth
nice they're not extremely blinding or
any things up I'm sure we can get it to
look nice and intense on the our faces
because I like that anyway guys I'm on
at end right now I apologize for being
on such a gnarly ask engine but at the
end of the day just be kind to people oh
shit yes bitch I'm here for this
absolutely here for this boom that's a
win hard win congratulations Kristen
lienen urban decay this is fucking
stunning holy shit I lost my train of
thought I don't know where we're at in
the conversation right now okay love
yourself first before anyone else
you can't love yourself and how you can
live with somebody else can I get name
it in here RuPaul you are right you are
fucking right these guys right here look
at that it's like such a beautiful
neutral palette and then we have the
bold palette right next to it so we're
gonna incorporate both of these let's go
on with something we're just gonna do
like a transition e mo mate and then
I'll go on something more bold actor
taking morphine five seven six day dream
so you guys I haven't working on the W
the past almost two years now and it has
been a it's been a fucking ride but it's
been like the best ride ever it's been
so much fun stressful fuck stressful
fuck I'm not gonna lie but it's been so
much fun and I'm so excited for the
first product and just to give you like
a hint I'm not gonna be like actually
like a really intense hint where you
guys are not gonna know what it is but
like a little hint about it is like this
product means a lot to me because it
basically is what jump-started my career
so I'm gonna say I'm not gonna say
anything too much about it it's a
product that I love and I use all the
fucking time when I do my video about
the product you guys will totally
understand
so I'm just very very excited about it
it's been a long time in the making I'm
hoping to launch in May that's like my
goal time because honestly with these
with this kind of thing with labs and
with distribution places and all that
shit there's so much work that gets put
into this that it's obscene almost it's
almost obscene because just is okay you
guys if I had it my way you know we
would have launched assists in fucking
December that was like the original goal
year ago that was the goal didn't happen
didn't have my way sadly but you know
why it's all good because that means I
get more time to focus on the product
more time to focus on the packaging more
time focus on everything else that's
involved with creating your own brand
you know
with the website but everything with
although I think you guys are gonna be
really excited about it and I think you
guys are gonna really love it I put so
much hard work and soul into this and I
would never release something that I
didn't love and didn't like fully
believe in it's just not my thing I
don't believe in that I believe in
working hard and creating something then
the day I own the brand it's my brand I
don't have an investor I've invested all
my own money into this so I'm my own
boss okay I get to decide the rules you
know I get to decide and I want
something to launch and when I want
something to be out and things like that
so I'm really really excited about that
aspect of it because I feel like that's
very very very important for me is being
able to have full creative control and
be able to control a lot of the aspects
of having a brand you know I want it to
be amazing I want you guys to have an
amazing experience when you're buying it
and when you're using it and things like
that so I hope you do it's kind of
ridiculous how nervous and you know it
really is I feel like I shouldn't be as
nervous as I am but I just am I can help
it's like my little baby took another
Ziya you know it's literally like
another fucking Zia for me and I've had
so much help along the way you know my
dad works with me my mom works with me
and they have been troopers to say the
least about this whole experience so
yeah I'm just really grateful I'm really
really grateful and I cannot wait to
watch my first product and hopefully
mayor June I also would really like to
ask you guys what you guys would like to
see from me in 2018 would you guys like
to see like from my brand you know what
would you guys like to see going on like
I already of course I have like the
ideas that I have and the things that
I'm doing them things I'm starting with
and the things I'm gonna be launching
with first of course it was there
anything in specific that you guys would
like to see from my brand or anything
that you like to see from a brand in
general like what is something you are
like bitch you better be bringing this
bitch out like what what is that product
for you I feel like the cool thing about
being able to have your own brand it's
like you can be like a brand for the
people you know I asked you guys advice
all the time and I asked for you guys
opinions all the time and I think that
that's a such a cool part about being an
influencer and getting millions of
followers it's like you get so many
different lavish opinions all the time
some opinions you don't wanna hear some
opinions to do want to hear but in the
day it's an opinion everyone gets the
right to one a bitch no but I'm not the
type of bitch that's like fuck you all
it's amazing I am really receptive you
don't suppose because this is my brand
you know I'm it's a brand for you guys
and I'm really receptive to feedback and
I'm not gonna be like that person that's
like oh well you guys are all just
fucking hey nerd I know you're not I
know you guys have money fucking best
interests at heart
you know especially the people are like
telling me things with love and so I had
said I was like yo if you--if you come
up with an emblem or logo that you
really really like anything that
embodies my brand more send it to me and
we'll see how it goes I got sent an
amazing and blum from Liz Liz I love you
and I'm using it like I bought it from
her and I'm obsessed with it and I'm
really really excited about it I think
that's gonna look beautiful and I love
it too can L be a little star it's so
fucking cute and I think it's very very
sleek and nice so thank you guys for all
the positive and constructive feedback I
was kind of cool actually I love how
it's like blended on the inner corner
then sharp on the middle like we're
going to finish up this look I just put
on some black and I put on some brown
eyeliner underneath my lash line it's go
ahead and blend that out before he gets
a little hairy or doesn't go with smokey
on the lower lash line by the way guys
just chill it out the top is the moment
so we're gonna keep it smoky down here
another thing I want to be doing in the
new year is just being a little bit more
fun and a little more creative with my
makeup you know wanting to take it there
a little bit more my first product
coming out is really gonna help me push
myself to be even more colorful and more
outlandish than I already am but you
guys already know like if you guys
watched my channel you know that I love
to do bold eyes incorporating color on
my eye and do a neutral lip that's like
my go-to thing I don't really think
that's gonna change a lot in 2018 but
I'm gonna try to make it more I'm gonna
try to just be more out there a little
bit of black - I'm already not really
scared of color colors nothing me like
freaks me out I don't mind doing color
on the eyes I love incorporating a pop
of color and things like that I just
want to take my techniques a little bit
farther this year like for example that
makeup I have on right now this is like
a what would you even call this this is
like um halo cut crease and helical
crease this thing that's like hey look
recycling are you know usually I would
never do something like this especially
using blues I want to be a little bit
more out there and I need you guys to
keep me fucking accountable okay you get
into your routines and you just settle
with your routines and you get happy
with your routines and I'm like yes I
look you I live a little bit live I
wanna be weak are you guys into like
bold dramatic makeup are you guys it's
really natural makeup like what is your
guys's go-to looks I'm really really
curious I love hearing about other
people's like go-to makeup looks in
there like go to fun moments I feel like
once the liner and the lashes go on like
it's cast together and there you have it
we have the eyes on
they are done and they are popping I'm
not gonna lie they're a little more bold
9000 it'll be going today but um we took
it there I guess I'm going to do the
lips real quick and I will be done once
today's video you know I'm saying no

already jumped off to a fucking start
you know I'm saying was drama happening
already on YouTube bouncer and

certain countries and so I like that
