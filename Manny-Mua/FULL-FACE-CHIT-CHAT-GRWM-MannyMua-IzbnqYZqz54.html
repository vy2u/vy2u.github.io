hilarious she's beautiful a good friend

and we did a club when I was at like 40k
it was like a Thanksgiving club so I was

first people to ever believe in my

audience and one day again like 6000
subscribers and ever since then like my
channel start taking off more and more
and I feel like I okay I think so much
what is this hair and I just love her to
death
and I'm so proud of her for clubbing
with colour-pop and I love you Kathleen
so much so happy to support you and I
think you guys all should too
so check her out um yeah there's always
kind of video don't thing you
know the drill that if you guys do
subscribe to my channel click Subscribe
right now if you got the I'll get you
guys to tutorial now and yeah right
yeah get ready with me
Soto and get this bitch started because
I just feel like doing a and
talking with you guys fill in that
you know okay cool so I already started
with primer and moisturizer on first so
moisturizer I used was the first day
Beauty daily face cream oil-free
non-comedogenic cream it was like this
this is what it looks like it's an
awesome moisturizer I love it because
it's very thin it's very lightweight
it's oil free so it's great for people
that are more oily in combination but
it's very hydrating it absorbs very fast
so I really like that about this one for
my primer zap is too nice so for the
t-zone I use the Make Up For Ever step 1
equalizer and smoothing and for the rest
of my face I use the hydrating one
because of the foundation I'm going in
with and I'll tell you about it right
now
why I did that we're gonna go in with
the Loreal Pro matte and fallible
foundation in the shade 103 which is
actually not my color this is a little
bit too dark for me I'm gonna mix it in
with the make a favor HD foundation
I love the L'Oreal foundation so much
like I'm literally shocked about how
much I love this foundation it's
like a moosie texture it's full coverage
long I don't like about it is that it
picks up on my dry patches which is why
it makes it with the mate Forever HD so
that's the only thing I don't like about
this one is that it will literally pick
up I can have a dry patch like over here
which sometimes I do
then it'll pick up on it and that pisses
me off so much that's why I'm using the
hydrating primer on outside my face
because usually like these parts will
get more dry and my t-zone will stay
oily so that's why I'm using the
hydrating primer on the outskirts of my
face and I'll use a damp Beauty blender
to blend it all in
I love mixing it with HD foundation
because it gives this beautiful like
Demi matte finish I broke out when I was
in New York I like broke out I don't
know maybe stress got me up or
the weather or just the atmosphere in
general whenever I travel I tend to
break out so that really annoys me but I
had a great kind of great time and even
early done and don't forget to put on
your ears to unwind telling you guys
don't forget to put on years because I'm
the one that always forgets to put on my
ears
why isn't how cool I'm like yellow and
then if my ears are red concealer I'm
gonna go and take the naked skin Urban
Decay weightless complete coverage
concealer in the color light neutral
which is a little bit lighter than my
own skin tone I love the feeling of this
concealer so much it is so creamy so
smooth
which is absolutely amazing but it's so
lightweight it's so cool
I put on the t-zone as well where I tend
to break out a little bit more don't
that Beauty Blender damp and just kind
of press it in yeah and I'm gonna go I'd
take my translucent brightening vanilla
powder by Besame Besame Besame I don't
 know I have no idea but this is
actually probably my favorite under eye
setting powder ever ever I'll take a
little bit on my morphe m-43 a to talk
about the brush all the time it's my
ultimate under eye setting brush I'm
just gonna set my concealer with it for
the rest of my face I'm gonna go in with
my Laura Mercier translucent powder
which I love I just wanna like it's a
really good travellish to powder it's a
very good QC map throughout the day it
doesn't pick up all my dry patches or
anything like that so I really like this
powder and so I'll just kind of load up
like a sponge this is from my Kodi
airspun powder this sponge I was really
load that bitch in there I'm just
pressing it in because I don't like too
much excess look before would be I'm not
sure my pants today there are button but
there's still pants I'm wearing them and
so I'm just gonna press that into the
skin mostly in the t-zone and then with
the rest of they go outwards and since I
don't really like to take liquids down
my neck
very much I'm gonna take this Mac Studio
Fix powder and NC 25 on my morphe g7 and
I'm take that down my neck just gonna
blend in color wise with my face it's NC
25 like you guys know I'm a light bitch
I love this brush so my future or
Browns I'm so happy that morphe got in
there gun medals they got so many other
gunmetal brushes back in stock thank
gosh Abuk code with morphe so don't
forget that you guys you guys get a save
10% on an emu wing in store to use my
 code if you want to save 10%
it's a commission code so you guys know
I didn't know you guys be so happy when
I share with you guys that things are
commission codes I just thought that was
normal for people to be like oh it's a
commission code I guess it's not people
aren't truthful sometimes and whatever I
have left on the brush I just gotta
press it into my face well sing a little
playing form I'm gonna go ahead and take
my makeup forever bronzer my matte
bronzer in the shade 20 and I'm gonna
take out on my my little temple a little
temple tips I just really just run that
in with that same g7 very lightly I
don't want to be too heavy with this one
it's a very light wash I thought using
bronzer just really brings so much more
like life and dimension to my face
there's because I'm so pale
cheekbone areum's with a little bit of
bronzer up in here just kind of blend in
that bronzer but my hair I love this
cloak is just a nice warm matte bronzer
this is great for men this is great for
people that like to do marveland on the
natural side with makeup
it's just a nice broader to bronze up
the face and shade 20 it's so as I got
beautiful warm terracotta color and I
love it loving it
that's almost like okay holy
I'm gonna take the Becca shimmering skin
Perfector in blush copper on a morphe
509 which is a tapered a tapered fluffy
brush so great just it's a white haired
Playford toughy everybody's a flavor
toughy I cannot get past play for 10
feet I don't know why very lightly dip
into it it's extremely pink too so just
because what I'm Jeannette does that
well the apples my cheek and pull it
back I don't have the most fullest
cheeks most full she's not even a word
my cheeks are very full so I like to
kind of take everything back to give me
more with a key elongated stretched back
look with my face and I'll go over with
my g7 and just kind of press that over
just kind of blend everything together I
feel like that's just gonna be better
it's so pigmented or like right away
like when you swatch is like boom bang
me so you need to be careful with your
little you're really him whole
what Sonia okay super highlight it's
funny I'm doing like my whole face and
I'm gonna do my eyes I don't here so now
I'm gonna go with a highly that I
literally never heard of it appeared in
my peel box and I was like what the
what is this it's called TLS I don't I
honestly it's like the most basic ass
packing like in the little screw thing I
don't know what the hell it is lots of
I'll have to look it up and find a few
guys in case you guys do like it but the
highlighter hole Mogga had me open it
it's like a loose powder highlighter
okay so this one is called what he
called blushing bride it is a like kind
of silvery pinkish purple highlighter so
we're gonna use that on my morphe M
501
mini baby paper blush brush I'm just
around that on my highlighting areas
see that's what I'm saying like what the
 is this madness and never ever
heard of his brand TLS these remind me
of the mack daddy highlighters what are
they called yeah that's what they call
the mack daddy artist coat or
highlighters they write me so much of
them but they're a lot better the back I
mean the mack daddy ones are ok like I
think they're pretty good I don't think
they stick to skin very well but other
than that they're okay these ones they
sent me 3 month and I'm dying for every
in color mmm juicy oh sure of course you
see a shaky head from in how much
pain I can I know you can do not deny it
I'm like a little greatly let me go
ahead and leave this oh ok g7 help me
out here
tell me up sweetheart cuz know a little
bit much isn't that nice I've never
heard of this brand never heard of it
didn't even reach out to me they just
literally sent it to my peel box and I
open it and I was like that was pretty
cool open it shocked shocked ok it's
into the ice I'm partially gonna grab
vanilla bean by make a beak on that same
morpheme m4 3/8 and I'm going to toss
that all over my lid this is gonna be to
set the primer I put down which I use
Mac Pro Longwear concealer in nw20 I use
that concealer as primer so many times
you guys know by now people have been
following me for a while you guys know
that's just my that isn't much
it I'm so excited to do to these eyes
using the where the light is palette by
color pop in collaboration with casting
light I'm so excited for you Kathleen
I'm so happy for you that you're doing
this it's not really a palette it's just
like a foursome quad BIA for dividual
shadows but I'm just so so happy for you
Kathleen
I'm so proud of you being able to do
this with them so first things first let
me just not him rambling about her
because I could all day I'm gonna grab
the color glow
on aged that kind of flat shader brush
this one's by Sophie these shadows are
very creamy and dense what does this
look like oh yeah mm-hmm so I'm just up
without anything my brow bone as my brow
bone highlight color it's a very just
champagne
Gulla we kind of color does have a glow
to it like honestly like look at my Brad
one really what is a glowy as I'll
just grab a um before you know just kind
of blend the edges of it I think I need
beaches and cream I'm gonna need her so
I'm actually going really quickly grab
beaches and cream I make a geek and I'm
just gonna use that as my transition
shade just cuz I use it almost in every
single tutorial and it's just really
helpful for me because the shadow blends
help everything it's the most beautiful
neutral peachy shade very very very
neutral though it's absolutely stunning
I'm chimp assigned to my crease now I'm
gonna go ahead and grab a morphe and
four three three which is a bridge is
dense fluffy white brush it's cut during
and I'm gonna take the color
Cornelius which is named after her dog
her favorite dog so cute I got it's like
basically just a very warm brown I'm
just gonna run that in there and just
run that into the crease with these
shadows because they are a cream you
want to use a more dense brush always
that's what I've noticed that these ones
you really want to do a very dense brush
to pick up the product and deposit
product and take that all the way in
they blend out so nicely
I'm actually gonna go ahead and grab a
sigma e30 pencil brush with the same
Cordelia shadow I'm sort of really
focused on the outer corner just kind of
build up that color I'm actually go back
in with a glow and I'm gonna use that
same flat brush I'm gonna toss that onto
my lid what a nice bright lid for this
look once I'm getting towards the
shadows I like to blend down to blend in
that Cornelius in with the glow color
now I'm actually gonna go ahead and grab
a morphe m32 thick which is a super
small tiny baby brush and I'm gonna grab
the color Kathleen light which is after
her name that you're so cute which is
it's stunning luck of the Irish gold
color I'm gonna run that underneath my
lash line on the inner corner to me that
golden glow must gonna run a little bit
on the inner corner as well going to
glaze shadow which is a very glittery
deep brown it's funny cuz this looks
like green kinda and like the camera it
has like a greenish tone and in person
it has a slight greenish undertone to it
very slight same little brush I'm gonna
run that on the outer third of my eye
it's very glittery but I'm trying not to
take it too far down because I don't
need glitter to my nostrils I don't I
don't and I'm blending it in with that
gold with that kathleenlights color
let's grab glow one more time can take
that on the inner corner of my
as well just really bring some light
back to it and you saw that nice gold
tone there as well okay let's do some
eyeliner so let's go ahead and take a
new eyeliner that just launched with
morphe it's called flex it's this deep
navy blue liner looks so sickening on a
sigma e oh sick which is probably my
favorite two liner brush ever it's so
precise it's so thin blue wing yeah so
just go and fill that in this is what it
looks like with the liner on I wanted to
do a nice like thick liner because I
didn't want the blue to stand out so
when you put lashes on I want to be like
there especially cuz I think they blue
matte liner go so well with this nice
orange e gold I think just makes the
eyes pop so nicely and I had a cheap -
morphine morphine you guys make me so
 happy and of course you guys get
to save money off of the liners - yeah I
completely forgot to do it with my inner
waterline betart inner rim liner the new
one this is my favorite nude liner for
the inner room of all time I take this
like with a travel with me how you I
wear this one I'm like an event it's so
creamy and just golden so easily if
you're looking for a good like nude
liner for the inner rim oh my god check
this out oops now we have the eyes done
I'm gonna go and curl my lashes and
apply some mascara I'm gonna use the
benefit roller lash mascara which is
like my mascara right now like I've been
obsessing living breathing dying for
like obsessed okay so now for lashes why
is it like so cool toned I feel like it
was warm tone you know it's cool toned
my camera like what the hawk I don't
know what to do my good settings
multiple at settings I'm sorry so I
didn't no one told me about velour
lashes and doll me up

seriously that was like the biggest
train wreck of train Oppong lashes ever
my I got super watery
the whole band came off it was a mess
that Lilly was like 10 minutes mice or
still watery still watering the
pissin me off
so that was my eyes so for the lips
we're gonna do mix people neutral lip
liner by NYX Cosmetics I just said that
and now we're gonna line all over the
lips in my favorite lip liner the reason
is my favorite is just cuz it's such a
perfect neutral pinky brown color and
