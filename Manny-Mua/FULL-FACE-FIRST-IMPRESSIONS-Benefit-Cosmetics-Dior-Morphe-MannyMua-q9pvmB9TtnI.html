it's a there's going to be a tutorial on
this look I have going on right now for
this video I use uh so many products I
haven't used in forever or I've never
even tried ever first impressions videos
always gave me kind of nervous cuz I'm
like okay am I gonna love you or am I
gonna hate you and it really kind of
tests you are like ability to like to
see how a product does in like a
situation and so I think it's really fun
to do like kind of first impressions
videos like especially cuz I did like a
full face
first impressions or full face like
products I am I don't really use on
camera or I've never used on camera so
it's kind of tiny I don't know I think
it's kind of exciting to be able to use
products on camera that I haven't talked
about before or actually used before at
all on my channel this look I think is
so beautiful and it's so perfect for
summer it's all warmth it's all brown
it's gonna be complimentary on literally
every single eye color like a compliment
to my eye color pretty well I have like
I have hazel eyes and I feel like it
makes the green and my eyes pop out
because it is so warm if you have brown
eyes if you have blue eyes this is gonna
be a perfect look for you guys as well
it's a very nice just neutral summery
look with a some brown liner I think
it's really cool it's different for me
I've never done brown liner on my
channel before so hope you guys like
this look that's why it's kind of video
if you guys don't like me don't
watch this video you guys know them - no
but you guys do please like the video
and please subscribe to my channel I
would really appreciate it so much
Sandra's actually the Behaim way I'm
gonna stop rambling now and get you guys
to the tutorial and I'll see you soon
bye the finger I don't know bye
so I'm gonna go instruct this full-on
first impression kind of funnest how
we're gonna be doing but I'm actually
gonna go and start it like I'm
differently I want to do the ice first
and then I'll do the face second I
always do the face first so I'm like
let's just switch it up today let me do
the eyes first you know I'm saying in my
brows already filled in and I kind of
haven't party lined with concealer and
kind of carved out that I just wanted to
skateboard because I wanted to be doing
a brow routine video anyway how the
pimples on my face should I do my eyes
first
yeah my seams not perfect and you guys
know that so first thing that I'm gonna
be using that I haven't used yet on
camera in front of you guys is the UH
Nastasia artist palette which is quite
beautiful it's like this awesome super
cool colorful Asness colorful ass
goodness honestly I really know we're
gonna be doing it today I know products
I want to use so that's what we're gonna
pay to ink it I'm going to take the
color buttery on a e30 brush one of the
new morphe brushes it's a really big
fluffy brush this is in go on the brow
bone to highlight and set the primer
that i use i use the smashbox 24-hour
primer i like this brush because it's so
fluffy and so big i'm gonna try to use a
lot of the new elite brushes because
this is more of a new video see how that
one's a lot more bright and i was like
did you know that's kind of what we're
going we're more of e27
and colored dusty rose and that's going
to go into our crease as our transition
shade the zeros is this beautiful
exactly what it sounds like dusty rose
color I'm gonna take that all the way
into the crease not being too neat with
it as you can see I'm moving cut mess
you know that I never take that same a30
I'm just kind of blend those edges out
what's next up bro okay so now we're
gonna take the color baby I'm a star
it's so cute on a morphine m-43 three
and that's gonna go out a corner just to
give us a nice little outer corner depth
and dimension this color is like a very
deep
rusty brown with some like shimmer to it
I put it right into the crease right
into the dusty rose color very lightly
until agrees darling so for the lid I
decided I wanna take one of the new on a
sausage shadows that they just came out
with for their summer collection
it's the peach sorbet I haven't even
used it like I literally haven't even
tried it so I'm really stoked it looks
beautiful it looks freakishly stunning
two titanium shadow it's like a peachy
gold or sitting my finger
I'm gonna pack down the lid damn that is
some golden right there
first it's much more intense than I
thought I was gonna be much more intense
so we need to you need to blend so I'm
gonna take a little bit of buttery and
dusty rose combined and I'm gonna put
that into the crease and blend out that
peach sorbet color because it is quite
intense on a a 13 by morphe I really
didn't think there believe that intense
holy crap the fun part about doing for
suppressions is like I know I do like
that wasn't happen so you guys didn't
see how exactly the shadows work you
know what I mean I think it's kind of
fun he's kind of fun you know I'm saying
how it's going on right now go I'm
trying I'm trying to get there no idea
what's happening I think it'll come
together Lee cool so next we're gonna do
liner I'm actually excited talk about
this new product right now because it's
the new benefit they're real push-up
liner in the color brown I'm really
excited about this because they're
actually launching like new colors of
the Vario lemon blue purple Brown green
like they're doing a bunch of the
colorful ones and I'm actually like one
of the first bloggers and vloggers to
actually ever get to see them and play
with them and talk about them I am a
benefit pretty committee member and I
really just want to say like thank you
to you guys because like I wouldn't be
be able to work with benefit or being
able do something with benefit without
you guys with all your guys to support
you know what I mean um thank you guys
for the love and support okay cool so
like what it is it's like a retractable
any like kind of crank it and I was like
that little like rubbery tip and a gel
liner formula comes out they have a
black one in the same formula the black
one wasn't really my favorite when I
tried it first like I thought was really
hard to use at first I was like I feel
like you needed like a learning curve
with it I was like I cannot figure out
this formula we get to work with it
really fast and I was like oh it just
wasn't feeling it so I'm actually gonna
try this for the first time right now my
my eyes I'm nervous I've already swatch
down my hand
the formula seemed a lot more creamy
than the black one so I'm really excited
I'm really excited about that
let's leave me win I already pushed up a
little bit um if you guys can see some
of the brown is there look she look yeah
it's already whoa wait cream years in
the last one okay it's a lot easier to
use when you're pulling your lid
oh my god so much creamier than the last
formula hmm twe doing that doing
it's going to take a little bit
concealer on a little brush and kind of
clean up a little bit of gold a little
bit of brown a little bit chola I love
it
had to love it honest opinion I think
this is a way easier and creamier
formula than the black one was not
saying that the backbone was bad I just
thought it was a little bit harder to
use than the brown one is that leave the
brown one is a lot creamier of Angelo's
Hedrick waking up your it's just not
fair how my right eye liner always turns
out so much better than my left right
it's always like cool look at that clean
chit
I don't damn boy okay I'm gonna do the
face before I finish like the rest of
the eyes like the under eye and stuff so
I think it's funny cuz whenever people
are doing like first impressions videos
they're kind of just hoping for the best
and hoping that their skills will take
over it's like the product is it like
exactly what they're expecting that's
how I feel whenever I'm using a new
product on camera for the first time I'm
like please Lord let the skills take
over pretty sure that the hubble's
people feel when they do first
impressions sure okay cool so I'm going
to prime my face first I'm gonna use a
Smashbox primer water I know I don't
really use it very often on camera but
I've been loving this bitch so much
obviously as you can see obsessed and
then I'm gonna go and use the benefit
Porefessional in the t-zone I forgot
about how much I love it the
professional which I put in the t-zone
only because that's what I had like
really intense pores as I'm sure you
guys saw because I was zoomed in you
guys can see all the mistakes in my face
because there was a little time you know
I'm human I break out everyone picks out
I don't see anything wrong with that at
all okay so I'm gonna take a new
foundation I just literally just bought
like couple days ago I bet CD or air
flash I'm so obsessed
honestly I'm obsessed I've never used it
on camera I'm in shade 300 take the
up and then I'm gonna take my morphe and
4:39 of course you guys know it's like
my go-to foundation brush I'm just gonna
spray the brush directly I'm not gonna
spray my face or anything like I spray
the back of my hand you should away the
brush die quickly I'm just gonna Pat it
onto my face over the pimple I have I
have a huge pimple on over here I'm
trying to like cover it up don't look at
it alright we'll talk to you and I don't
it to introduce itself does it just look
flawless it looks flawless on this and
then this like okay cool here's basic
mani pretty you know so because of the
fact that I am more on the oily side I
need to be cautious in the t-zone or I
will get really freakishly oily
throughout the day if I don't put a
mattifying primer in the t-zone I'm
talking like I used it the other day and
I didn't put a primer in the t-zone like
a mattifying primer in the t-zone and by
the end of the day I look like I was
cooking eggs
the grease on my face swear it was that
bad
don't forget your ears I always forget
my ears this color is slightly dark for
me like it's not my neck shade or
anything but I'll take more powder tell
me like anyway so I don't really care
how much I love people like you need to
match your neck more I'm like bitch I
don't you do anything how do you do
anything I'm gonna do what I want
you think it's oh pretty okay
let's go ahead and take a concealer that
I haven't used on camera for every this
is the Tarte Amazonian clay waterproof
12-hour concealer it's like in a little
stick and let's just put that in the
concealing areas this is the most creamy
stick concealer I've ever used
in my whole entire life the coverage is
like Studio Fix by Mac but the
consistency is like the creamiest of the
cream I can't even begin to explain so
I'm gonna go into a morphic g2 and just
gonna blend that out or blend that in it
blends like a dream like it blends like
a drink it's super thick whatsa blends
really nicely I don't how to explain it
the coverage is beautiful blends out
beautifully it's just really like look
like it's blending really nicely even
though it's a freaking full covered
stick have you guys tried this one let
me know you guys stop because I'm pretty
obsessed with it right up to the
darkness in the inner corner is a
creaseless concealer but you guys know
that I'm a crazy bitch in general I
crease like a mother I'm going take the
Laura Mercier under eye setting powder
this is my favorite powder I know those
people more of a first impressions video
but man I can't not use this I swear I
can and set your under eyes with it now
I'm gonna go and take a new big ol brush
from morphe it's the g0 which is like
their biggest like face brush I think
that they have it is huge but I'm so
obsessed with it let me take the Mac
medium mineralize skinfinish to set my
whole face we're gonna be glowing today
I was going to set that the whole face
with a g0 and then for the neck I'm
gonna take that make a forever pro
finishing powder and 1:18 it's just
going to kind of match the color of my
face down to my neck because I didn't
take the air flash down my neck you know
to mean that my skin looks really
freakin pretty right now and I
hmm another new thing or take the
Smashbox contour palette it's like a
little like trio thing I'll take the
yellow shade without underneath my eye
to kind of highlight my under eye area
what are you thinking what are we
thinking here
it's brightening it's very brightening
yeah hell yeah that's highlight that's
like a highlight let's do it it's really
nice though this powder is really pretty
I think wow so now I'm gonna go take the
middle shade which is like the bronzer
of the three on my morphe too of course
the new ally brushes you go fun fun game
right I'm gonna broad with this color
blend if you put too much it's all Gucci
it's all Gucci it's all Gooch on the
forehead as well it is a very warm
beautiful bronzer I really am a proven
of this little mini palette this is
great for like a purchase let me like
toss into your bag and should be like
let's go Browns real quick that's great
for that for the first time using I
think they came out really pretty hmm
what's for you bitch
good job smash I'm not really getting a
contour today it's I'm not feeling the
contour life so I understand get some
blush on I'm gonna take V they never use
this the bomb hot mama

identical it's like that peachy gold
pink I'm gonna take the morphe 3 blush
brush of my existence and I've done the
blushing areas oh it's very pretty it's
a golden pink oh what's so pretty
I feel like a glowing bride I like glow
all over the cheeks honestly like I know
I have acne on my cheeks I know I'll
have bums and I know I have bridges and
 but honestly like I'm not gonna let
up a couple bumps on my face
to turn me from using highlight and
stuff honestly I'm really not I don't
care it's annoying but don't let like
stupid things like that deter you from
using makeup don't let that happen and
anyone that says anything about your
acne stick it up their ass this finger
stick it up their butt as a highlight
because I want a little bit more okay I
know I'm a weirdo I know I'm gonna take
the morphe 310 and the new draw

let's go and finish the bottom of the
ice we're not going to do a lot to the
bottom of the eye it's pretty simple
what we're gonna do I'm gonna take dusty
rose again on a morphe 14 which is like
a flat shader brush very little bit of
it you don't need a lot and I'm gonna
run that underneath the lash line this
brush is really nice because I like
deposits and it blends really nicely
since I kind of blend it all right and
then we take the morphe ether thi talk
about my favorites video it's amazing
and that same baby I'm a star from the
palette I put that on the outer corner
I'm just kind of feather it in slightly
but not a lot because I want it to be
mostly on the outer corner like this a
very Brown smoky kind of thing going on
I know it's so summer this is so summer
and you try to go that way but it
totally turned out that way
