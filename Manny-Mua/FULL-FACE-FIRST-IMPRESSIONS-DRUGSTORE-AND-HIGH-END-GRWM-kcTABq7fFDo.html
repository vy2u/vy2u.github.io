really stoked this is what she looks
like in here yes warmth so thank you so
much to nurse for wanting to partner

to announce I'm sponsoring whenever I do
a sponsorship opportunity because don't
be I just want to sit down and to chat
with you guys I'm really feeling the
holiday spirit this year and I'm just I
love the holiday time I feel like it
brings out the best in people but also I
feel like brings out the worst in people
too
you know what I'm saying I feel like
it's a very very stressful stressful
time I'm just like in a happy mood like
I'm just I'm really happy during the
holiday times because I see my family so
much good to see their faces like when
they get opened a gift you know I'm just
it's exciting like I have a lot of fun

started on today's video and I'm gonna
stop rambling now let's go
I haven't really done like too many
holiday esque type makeup looks so I'm
so excited I should have a bunch of
products here that are like more new or
things I really gotta test out that much
there's a bunch of things I have not
tried so I wanted to do that yeah yeah
let's go ahead just jump on in I already
primed my face by the way and let's go
in with the foundation what this video
is mostly about and so this is the NARS
radiant long wear foundation let me give
you all the deets on the foundation and
then give you guys that deep this is a
16 hour wear foundation with 33 shades
that's narses biggest shade range
they've ever came out with so that's
really really exciting and so awesome
for you guys NARS it's supposed to give
you a full coverage with a natural
radiant finish basically think of it as
like the radiant screaming concealer and
like a full bottle form that's not
Nikita explained it to me I was like No
so we're gonna go in with the shade
Vienna 4.5 light and I'm gonna try this
one when I do do it three pumps right
here right so as I'm saying right here
we have as like a nice consistency -
it's not too heavy but it's not too thin
either which I really really enjoy let's
go in with a morphe M 439 great
foundation brush let's go on Ian I'm
excited so this is supposed to be oh but
I supposed to be a full coverage without
the heavy full coverage feeling so
that's kind of what it was described as
honestly like as I'm putting on my skin
it feels like nothing so which is that's
already like I'm so excited about I kid
you know I feel like this is like just
packed with ultra pigments so that's why
oh my god it looks sickening oh my gosh
she said this is like her go-to
foundation like it's been her coach at
foundation since you got a sample of it
in New York during Fashion Week with
NARS and I was like no and she said yes
so thank you nurse for wanting to
partner with me in this video to test
out your new foundation because I've
been really dying to try it out anyway
so I'm gonna use a little beauty sponge
to do the nose I always just like doing
a beauty sponge on my nose cuz I feel
like it just looks more pretty also this
guy is sweat resistant transfer
resistant and it also resists
oxidization so actually stays the true
color when you put it on honestly you
guys for some pressure
I think that this is stunning I really
truly do I'm so happy that this looks so
good like I really really every look
stunning to me like I love it it doesn't
I would not partner with NARS if I
didn't think I was gonna love this I
used to love wearing my foundations and
I worked at Sephora so I'm like y'all
have such good enough foundations I need
trying I also love this point delivers a
weightless feel with superior blend
ability for an impeccable effort that
looks natural like skin never drying
never cakey bitch I believe it I think
you all know first impressions so far
this is a hit so now that we have the
foundation on I wanted to go in with the
kaity concealers I've used these twice
now and I really wanted to get more of a
fair like keep testing them out to see
what I think about them so these are $20
when I first tried it out I really
really liked them so I want to keep
testing them out and see what are my
continuous thoughts
honestly I'm living like I actually live
where it's gonna be real radiant today
because this cuz you already didn't
finish as well oh she's a drag queen
tonigh Oh hunty she's a queen now go
ahead and set everything in place with
whatever you want to use I'm gonna take
my Charlotte Tilbury airbrush finishing
powder because this is like my go-to so
I'm gonna set all the high points with
the shade one and I set the perimeters
with the shade two basically everywhere
that I put concealer shade one and show
you everywhere else you guys honestly
this face is beat and I'm obsessed like
with how everything looks
NARS you guys really did that really
damn so that would just be fun for us to
sit down to chat and talk about life and
how things are ghia healing you know I'm
saying how is your guys's holidays going
do you guys celebrate Christmas do
celebrate Hanukkah Kwanzaa New Year's
what do you all have to like what are
you guys to do during the holidays like
what is you guys's traditions if you
have a family tradition what do you guys
celebrate during the time for me I know
this year we're gonna be going down to
San Diego to visit my little brother
of course he lives in San Diego stole
actually for us during Christmas Eve we
opened all the presents I thought that's
like a very Mexican thing to do like I
know a lot of other Mexican families
like that opened their presents on
Christmas Eve and Christmas Day like the
Santa ones you know I'm saying on my
dad's side we do like a Secret Santa
situation like every single year we do
like Secret Santa and we're like okay
bitch
who the did you get which cousin
did you get I love it I don't know I
love like family traditions and things
like that they're so fun Robert like a
family traditions kind of family
actually we never really did much
traditions
ever but parents are cool
okay next new product we have going on
right now we have these new L'Oreal True
Match highlighter pellets L'Oreal really
stepping it up bro
and we also have these shimmery stones
like little like loose powders this is
sick
like for a drugstore Bren to come out
with these kind of things this is
 cool a moon kissed absolutely
not they just felt really you know good
chunky flaky just not cute so let's go
for these let's try these out look at
this one of me a little harder for me
cuz I'm like so here look this woman
here this is what I'm talking about
L'Oreal this is what I'm talking
about I wanted from these but that was
chunky and nasty these remind me so much
I like the Kylie cosmetics and color pop
like the artist could tour those like
loose powders that are really shimmery
and intense we're gonna take moon light
I believe it's called Oh stun it's just
like hella lit though like this is like
blue I like a bluish reflect to it
because this one is actually too dark
for a skin that will show up like
this was stuff like that all my skin
like it'll be way too dark and moonlight
is like green and blue and
purple Nori's instead we're gonna use
the NARS double take man ray highlighter
Nash's are being sweet in partner I mean
why not give him some extra love this
actually looks
I needed something beautiful something
gold something solid oh my word
man ray excuse the hell out of me sir
you did that yes you did well I like
about this one a lot it's buildable it
builds to something blinding but you can
do like a subtle soft layer and it will
be like just like beautiful and
lightweight like I love that about this
one
she's feeling really snatched and I'm
living it so I'm gonna go ahead and do
the brows off camera real quick now
we'll come back we will do the eyes and
the Lupe's alrighty then
I just watched Ace Ventura for the first
time ever and now I'm like living for
 that movie uh so good you guys
so we have the brows on there's a quick
little brow fill nothing too intense
nothing too crazy let me go ahead and
zoom you on to get into this mug
okay so now we're gonna go and talk
about the new wanted palette by nurse
it's beautiful I'm not gonna lie
it's s so here we have 12 shades
for finishes we have a buttery matte
shades of shimmers metallics and
lustrous satin shades as well and I
believe at 10 of these guys are limited
edition shades I just like this power
lot because I feel like it's very very
diverse like you get a good variety of
clothes in here and you can actually get
all you can actually accomplish an
entire look I get frustrated with
palettes that don't give you the big
transition colors that don't give you
enough lid colors and things like that
so I'm really pleased with this one that
gives you everything that you could need
to create different types of looks
I want to swatch a couple of them real
quick let's do this one just like oh
that's unique so three metal shades
right here let's do it matte as well you
guys these are really nice we got one
swipe right here these are all obviously
all metallic shades I'm feeling festive
this is also a new formula for NARS so
this is a pure pigment formula which
gives you like the ultimate color payoff
I just really like the shade range and I
feel like you can be any skin tone any
color well you'll find something that
won't work for you in this palette so
cute little on-the-go palette watt Ted
okay now we're gonna go and do it iLook
with it I'm not really exactly sure what
kind look I want to do this color though
is like right here this Shane makes me
gag so bad looking it okay you know what
we're gonna just start going in we're
gonna start playing with the colors and
then I'll start to decide as I
dwindle alone okay we're taking morphe
m53 three okay guys we're gonna go right
on in one take this shade right here
this beautiful neutral Brown match my
name morphe m-53 three this shade is I
believe seven have in the crease that is
already primed and beautiful a little
pocket right there see that beautiful
pocket that I have so effortless to
blend so happy about that
so now we're go in with shadow Hill
which is a really beautiful warmer Brown
on a morphe r39 great brush for applying
shadow and blending because these
shadows are so buttery and soft like
they're just nice to like they're just
 nice mmm beautiful I love it now
it's gonna get tricky I don't really
know exactly I want to do really new
actually you know what I think I'm gonna
go with something just pretty and
actually very holiday so I'm gonna go in
with this shade up here this beautiful
champagne stunning shade I'm gonna put
that onto the lid and that shade I
believe is called delirium so I'm gonna
go in with the shade delirium right here
I'm gonna put that onto the lid uh it's
so beautiful and I'm gonna do something
more festive on the lower lash line and
we're gonna make this holiday 8s because
this is the top of the ice so far and
I'm literally living and breathing for
it and I wanna take a little bit of
coconut grove which is this really dark
chocolaty Brown doesn't go in the outer
corner just a deeply everything uh-oh
that's a dark shade I'm taking different
brushes things we're taking that autumn
or if you are 40:1
it's a very very very deep brown almost
black shade and this is just going to
accentuate the outer corner like
everything a little bit deeper okay so
we finished at the top of the eye this
is what it looks like so far just a
really pretty winged out situation going
on just mmm
now I'm gonna finish the other eye off
of camera and I'll be right back okay so
these are the tops of the eyes so far so
we got going in classic gorgeous
champagne smoky stunning so now what I'm
gonna do I'm gonna do a little bit more
of a maroon a lower lash line just to
kind of keep it more festive and little
more warm we're taking a brown eyeliner
and a brown eyeliner that you guys have
works great I'm just gonna be taking me
Marc Jacobs a rokoko
eyeliner is my favorite one
in the lower lashlines like a shimmery
bronzy brown just give me that smoky
definition without being too harsh and
like a black shade so I'm gonna take the
shade wicked game we took a beautiful
cranberry and I'm gonna put out my lower
lash line and I'm gonna deep it on the
outer corner just to give it that fast
to be look but I wanted to keep it very
fun and fall so now that we have our
base color down this is the base color
for the lower lash line and take that
same a36 pencil brush I'm going to mix
temptress and coconut grove which is
this warm shade and this cocoa mean deep
shade I'll put on the outer corner make
sure we really keep that deep out there
and we have a cute little holiday moment
going on right now so I wanna take this
really pretty pinky satin shade which is
called that is a little bit it's not
like a crazy intense shadow it literally
just cuz a soft Sheen do that there's a
beautiful little subtle thing that is
going on it with a morphe one six seven
okay so now that the eyes are done I'm
gonna go ahead put some mascara and
lashes off of camera and I'll be right
back okay guys and this is the final I
look that we have going on using the
warm today
palette I love how it turned out I think
it's so pretty I think this is a really
really cool way to incorporate a little
bit of color during the holidays you
know holidays are filled with reds and
greens and golds and things like that's
not what I thought really fun pretty
champagne on the lid with a little bit
of maroon red and on the bottom but I'm
making it to red where it's like scary
looking where people were like being too
intimidated so I think using a chocolate
brown in the waterline really really
really helps keep it looking a little
bit more wearable you know and I think
that turned out great I think this is a
really fun look or the holiday season to
incorporate a little bit of colors now
that we're done with that we are going
to go ahead and do the lip that we will
be done I'm gonna take this colour-pop
lippie pencil and I'm gonna take this in
the shade BFF - I'm just gonna do a
quick lip line cuz I really really
really want to use the Kim
kardashian-west Beauty rose gold lip
gloss things I wasn't mean okay okay
this is the liquid just a little so far
we're gonna test the loss and I'm taking
the shade rose-gold like I said earlier
this is a lot okay gonna have to fill in
the whole lip with the pencil now we can
use the glass it feels good it's a
little sticky it's not too bad bad
though and that's what you guys that's
it for today's entire video this is a
look we came out with using the goodies
we didn't taste video honestly I feel
like my face looks completely snatched
to a ground and I'm literally living
only that didn't really work for me was
the L'Oreal products like to Lauri a
little glow palette everything else

really pretty and I'm very very very
