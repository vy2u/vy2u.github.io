today's video is going to be a full-face
first impressions video I have not done
a video like this and I think like over
a year literally every single product
they use almost every single product I
use is completely new to me I have not
tried it before in the past so I really
wanted to try a video like this my whole
tired face is like a first impressions
the whole thing so I figured it'd be
really fun to film today's the 4th of
July I was feeling kind of festive with
the blue lip and I'm like let's do it
I've not done a blue lip and so long and
it's fun it's a really fun look to do
but yeah this is look I came up with
like a silvery smoky eye with like this
blue on lower lash line the blue lips
it's kind of a different look for me but
I really do think these are really
really fun to do and I like to push
myself to be different I guess to do
more different looks you know what I
mean sometimes I'll get clocked on
YouTube for doing too many of the same
looks I don't think I do the same looks
all the time but other people do so I'm
gonna try to do something different it's
always the lips I think about if I just
change the lips up oh the look is
completely different what but whatever
as always if you guys want this video if
you guys don't like me please don't
 watch it you know the drill with
that but you gotta join this video
anyways do let me please like this video
and subscribe to my channel if you
aren't already and if you knew what's up
I'm an emu and welcome to my channel hi
thank you for being here but yeah let's
going to get into this full face first
impressions glam ass buck video bye guys
you
so let's get started on today's video I
literally have not filmed into it but
three weeks maybe it's been like so long
so I'm like let's just try to get back
into the swing of things and go out of
town in a couple days so I'm like let's
do this now so I was gone for about 10
or 11 days and I got so much new stuff
that I really wanted to film a first
impressions video on stuff that I just
received like so many different things
and so I'm like you know what would be
great to try out so many different eggs
in one video so that's kind of what
today's video is it's a full-face first
impressions so first thing for summer
prime I'm gonna take V Urban Decay poor
perfecting complexion primer potion
never tried this it's like one of those
like nicest silicone II oh it's really
thick it's like a nice a silicone based
primer for some reason thought it was
gonna be colorless we're just put down
the center of the face and just blend
outwards
does it look pink am I crazy cool - my
pores look a little bit small and it
feels like nice and ready to go on with
some foundation so I'm gonna go in with
V key px1 invisi wear liquid foundation
I've actually not tried this out yet so
I'm really excited to this however great
things about this foundation it's a very
but it's very popular so we're gonna go
on with that pump up that looks like
thick and creamy
hmm I'm actually going with in our teeth
brush I'm never doing Ewan I'm soaked
okay I've literally just got a big PR
package from artis and I never any other
brushes so I'm really excited to see how
they work out I don't know I feel like
I'm not gonna like them that terrible I
like using Beauty Blender so much more
than brushes anyway that I'm like let's
just pretend let's just pray we're gonna
put some on the brush and you just world
guru whose it actually not even up
this one Nisha is my color you just
painted on this brush is probably the
softest brush I've ever felt my entire
existence do you brush or do pounds like
what do you do with these brushes bx1
color I have is the shade f-100
that's actually really fast though huh
the application was a quick look up in
my freaking faces like for it to cover
that much it's pretty good man so this
is the finish of the foundation what do
you guys think of it I think it looks
really really pretty the coverage is
very buildable I feel like my face looks
really
airbrushed and pretty I'm digging this
for a real the toilet of new concealers
now I know that Tarte just released some
concealers they look like Dean and there
are Lea shaped tape contour concealers
I have this shade light and light medium
so we can mix them together I feel like
light is too light I like meetings too
dark so I'm gonna mix these two guys
together look at the freaking applicator
that's massive
so let's go ahead and combine those guys
together and see how this works I'm
nervous
we're gonna go with a darker one closest
to my eye closer to my skin tone and
then I'm gonna go in with the light Wow
 is thicker than a snicker okay okay
first impression is that it's extremely
thick and dense and probably full
coverage as hell it's going to highlight
look at two of the lightest one now
we're just gonna get a little damp a
beauty blender and blend that out and
see how it blends the coverage is there
mama the covers are there mother oh my
goodness I like it
you guys know me I'm a full coverage
Queen I love it this can see this smells
like a tropical most tropical house it
considers own tropical
it smells like fruity I don't even not
explain it it just smells really good
for a concealer a little goes a very
long way with this concealer as you guys
can see oh my goodness this looks
friggin sake I like it close we're gonna
go and set the face now I'm gonna take
me a new powder that I just got this is
the la Prairie cellular treatment powder
I don't know I heard talk to you talking
about it and I was like I need this my
life
now what talkie says you need something
off a cup and need it this was really
expensive dome hmm-hmm was really
expensive do this concealer is not
creasing fast either I'm just noticing
that right now like it's not creasing
that fast and usually can see this
crease like so quickly on me
this one surprisingly is it this is kind
of why I'm here
it really is I'm already it well
so for the under the eye I'm gonna use
the Beauty Blender and the leopard
powder I'm just going to use this and
set it right with this powder
it's a translucent setting powder it's
not can give you coverage oh this powder
is really nice oh my god I never take a
big artiste brush I'm gonna set my face
with the brush does this work like I'm
beating my head with a toothbrush thank
you but why does my face look porcelain
so the powder is absolutely beautiful
holy crap Tati you're so right all the
 time I love you I'm going to a
powder foundation for the neck you guys
know I don't like to go in with frickin
liquids down my neck I'm gonna take this
one by Urban Decay I'm just gonna run
that on the neck let's work this is a
weird with this buggy
brush foundation looks pretty the powder
on top of the foundation looks really
pretty I like it a lot in the concealer
that concealer is really speaking to me
and I feel like I'm going to need to use
that a lot more so I'm gonna go ahead
and bronze up the skin now I'm going to
grab the Laguna casino NARS combination
thingy didn't know they did this and I
just got this Riesling so I'm not gonna
try it out I'm Morphy to just go with
both in just a thug life or I've never
even tried Laguna or Casino bronzer at
all
sooo this could be interesting
oh well that's a tad darker than I
thought it was gonna be
hmm I don't know if I like it I don't
know yet you know it's getting better
it's getting better as they blend it
into my skin it was at first I was like
whoa like a little nerf I was a little
nervous then combined is a pretty bronzy
color it is it's nice it's nice and it's
warm very bronzy and has like a subtle
very very subtle shimmer to it
hmm if you have texture I don't know
this is the bronzer for you because Doug
it's picking up on my texture because it
does have a slight sheen to it it's a
very pretty color but the shine does
make it look like a more pimples than I
would like to be shown hmm
let's go and cook underneath the bronzer
with the Lipari powder again with this
morphe m45 8 is gonna help give us a
more of a sharp line underneath that
bronzer just to kind of help us get more
of a contoured sharp appearance this
powder is so lightweight I don't know if
it's gonna do anything honestly it's
such a lightweight powder hmm we'll see
how that goes okay so let's go
on to the friggin chinks so I'm going to
go ahead and use the new Becca
shimmering skin perfecter mineral blush
champagne split Jaclyn hill collaborated
with becca to create these badboys its
colors champagne splash champagne pop
and a flower child I believe on this
side such a pretty blush I really want
to try these out today oh they're so
pigmented hope Oh careful
flower child on the cheeks why is that
so beautiful though I'm so sorry
Beckham blushes are seriously so
freaking good so pigmented so creamy so
blendable I love them so now I'm gonna
go in with the morphe M 510 and the
champagne pop side and go ahead and oh
my god there's hope it's so pigmented
hmm I'm gonna go ahead and highlight the
face look at champagne pop glow I mean
go huh same thing this is a highlighter
that changed the world does it feel like
that does they kind of feel like chappie
and pop really like took over the entire
universe and now like so many things are
inspired by champagne pop it's so cool
to see Jacqueline and Becca clap like
this and do such cool things and
continue on at the champagne pop legacy
that has happened from the boom of this
color it's huh it's gorgeous
stop at the tapas most point of my
highlight I'm gonna take a little bit of
the new the brand new Oprah highlighting
palette in Beverly Hills five shades
that's like a super hyper pigmented
highlighter it's absolutely maybe almost
the lightest almost a white shade that's
right at the very very tip of my
highlight just a tip oh no you guys okay
this seriously this highlighter so
that's five colors every single color is
completely different and you can swirl
it around for one thing the white one is
when I just bought right now look at
these Cup this highlight is
definitely more on the powdery side it's
very pigmented it's very powdery so if
you guys don't like that powdery feeling
huh it's gonna be a little bit powdery
but the effect that you get from it is
absolutely amazing and it really does
work so well I have a code with them
many anyway if you guys want to save
some money on it be my guest
but I would say definitely Beverly Hills
highlighter it's freaking nice so we
have the face portion completely done
this is what it looks like I think it
looks freaking cool I'm so happy that
the first impressions I did of these
products is actually good and I'm not
like disappointed by anything so stir
what I was notice up I've been like
sorry brand you're kind of sucks no
that'd be that'd be mean I would never
do that well what I really oh yeah so
I'm gonna go and finish off with the
brows now I have any new brow products
I'm just gonna use the new benefit brows
up in my brows just cuz that's what I
have so I'll be right back great so the
brows are completely done now my eyes
are primed brows are done and let's go
and get his eye look I actually asked
you guys on snapchat whether you guys
wanted to see a tutorial using the
morphe 35o palette or I'm talkin to know
Pellatt actually actually guys a
screenshot which one you guys want to
see more and this is the past that one
so we're gonna be taking the Natasha
Genoa and doing it I look with it and I
think I just want to go dramatic on the
eyes hand on the lips this is the
palette that ended up winning it's so
freakin stunning it's an extremely
expensive palette yeah but we're gonna
use it today anyway
so we're gonna go in first with the
shade flamingos honey morphe 27 it just
like a very very just light beige II
almost pink tone and that's gonna be our
transition it's all satiny this is
actually gonna go basically all over you
don't even need to put this only on the
creature with this anywhere because it's
so light it's almost like my skin tone
the one thing I will say about this
palette I wish I had more about I had
more transition shades it does not have
a lot at all and it kind of annoys me
so I'm going to shade shell sounds like
a cool tone pink beige and I'm gonna go
in with that on the other corner of my
eye to give us some extra dimension and
definition I know you guys are probably
gonna say like oh my god you're going
with pinks again there's no transition
so there's not really a lot of options
here I'm just trying my best
I'm trying my best this goes
actually definitely more on the gray G
side for sure we're gonna take it all
the way in to the inner corner gonna
blend that out a little bit with my e27
again I cannot wait for more of you to
launch their new collection because I
know that lead brushes are really really
limited right now and they're
discontinuing them so I really hope they
come out with an awesome new collection
so I can start using those brushes for
you guys more now I'm gonna go into the
shade Arizona and that's gonna go on the
outer corner it's like a very dark brown
shade that's going to go out here to
give us a definition on a more feet g27
pencil brush nice color these shadows
man they are pigmented is and just blend
that with that 4-3-3 snow it's really
pretty
darker outer corner it's very dainty and
very pretty and so now we're gonna go in
with I don't know what to do on the lid
guy I think I want to do a blue lip like
I want to do this on the lips so I'm
thinking about this silver on the eyes I
never do silver on the eyes holy crap
should I do it anyway it's a tag line
I'm gonna go in with the shade aluminum
on my finger and that's gonna go all
over the lid holy
wait this is really pigmented hold on
we're gonna go in with aluminum
on the lid oh is this it is this serious
it's for real we're taking aluminum
which is basically liquid silver
and that's going to go on our lid with
these kind of intense foiled shades you
definitely want to go in with a finger
or something really really flat and
synthetic because you will get some
fallout like not gonna lie
kind of hard to avoid with these kind of
shades so don't Lee just kind of be
aware of that so that's I like to go
with my finger with these ones with
these I mean my friend Gabriel always
clocked me for saying these ones that's
not really a real thing I can help it
Gabi go ahead and blend out those edges
a little bit I don't know why I avoid
silver like the Black Plague
I really do I can't even help it I just
don't really like silver but this color
is so so beautiful we're gonna shade
moonstone on a more feet 32 and that's
going to go on the inner third of the
eye just to give us more dimension it's
a little bit lighter it's more champagne
I hope it's on the inner corner
so sadly my camera died and I had to put
on lashes and do liner off of camera and
change my shirt because I was way too
sweaty with these lights on the shirt so
Q has a little moon on it to see that
how me is this shirt though so I went
ahead and I believe Sasha lashes on by
who to beauty so I'm gonna try to do
something incorporate blue on the lower
lash line just a little bit like a touch
of blue rather than being so intense I
think I'm going to grab the shade cloudy
blue and I run that underneath my lash
line
this shade is actually really really
cool like a turquoise golden blue it's
so pretty hope you guys didn't see it on
camera it looks really nice in person I
this shadow because it's bold without
being too bold you know what I mean so I
think looks really pretty going to any
cream liner color pen so I'm gonna take
the tart one two in a room liner and run
that on my waterline if to open up a
little bit more go ahead and place some
mascara to the bottom lashline and now
we have the eyes completely done I'm
going to zoom you guys in to see what
they look like up close
awesome so dolly the eye is completely
done basically the fix is done all we
need left is the lips I'm gonna go ahead
and go in with this new to face color
that I just got this is the Too Faced
melted matte in the shade whose sumin
who basically it's a blue lipstick and
I've never tried any of the new Too
Faced ones and they look so cool I think
the packaging is really really different
and unique and I think it's cool so I'm
gonna go ahead and take this a blue
shade on the lips
wish me luck I don't really do blue lips
very very often but thinking let's be
adventurous today why not dude I think
this looks freakin sick what do you guys
think I love it
I freaking love it honestly and this is
the final look
