today's video is going to be a
continuation on from the first video I
just uploaded a couple days ago unboxing
a bunch of PR makeup we're going to
continue on with the second part of this
video but yeah you guys let's get into
this a full tutorial excited to try this
thing we have a lot of new goodies I
want to try out today so I'm very very
excited about that if you guys have not
seen the video prior to this one I will
leave it linked down below of course as
always if you guys like this video if
you guys do not like me please don't
 watch it you know the Jo with
that you don't have to watch me if you
don't like what you guys do like this
video please subscribe to my channel if
you're not already and if you're new
what's up a mani MUA and welcome to my
channel thank you so much for being here
I really genuinely appreciate it from
the bottom of my heart thank you for
allowing me to do what I love to do
every single day of my life so
yeah you guys let's going into this full
face of using PR makeup so of course
when you're doing an unboxing you don't
really know where you're going to get so
the things that I do not have I'll be
using things I already have in my
collection to compensate for like for
example I didn't box any brow products
so I'll be using like my own brow
products I want to use so just get you
guys taking weight that's not new I
didn't unlock something new in that
category so that's why I'm using it
ok so let's lay this makeup let's make
this bitch last all day um you guys want
do anything about your pores going to
use a little pore filler in the t-zone
so I'm gonna do I'm gonna take a little
bit of the benefit Porefessional in the
t-zone real quick
I'm keeping the facial hair going strong
right now guys I don't know why I just
feel like why not my skin feels real
good right now okay so let's go ahead
and start off with the foundation that
we unbox in the last video this is the
Smashbox Studios skin that's shaping a
foundation so we're gonna take the shade
1.1 I don't know it's my shade we'll see
honestly guys I'm pretty I'm pretty sure
this is my shade you guys know I like to
usually go a little more tan you all
know me mommy likes to be real
next it's very pigmented on the ski it
feels very very lightweight does it feel
intense whatsoever so we're gonna use a
little kicking big sponge and we're
going to press that into skin you can
see how this looks this definitely does
not give a lot of coverage which is
really weird beside darkness mm give me
a lot more coverage
how weird okay so I actually um don't
like this foundation so far I don't
think that it looks really pretty on my
skin I think it actually really
besides my texture a lot and I'm not not
very happy with the look of this so
we're going to apply some Dewar air
flash on top just really try to help the
situation that we're in right now crazy
I'll just a little layer of dirt flash
makes such a difference
uh-huh can always trust you or to really
come do for me morphe and 4:39 and do
our flash coming in clutch as they
always have for me don't have a new
concealer so we're gonna do is I'm gonna
take a little bit of my current
obsession conceal this is the NARS soft
matte I don't put that underneath the
eyes I love this come see the right now
so much conceal don't feel don't let oh
no okay so I get to hand with the
conceited because we do want to use the
Kim Kardashian contour so it's sealed in
this little time stick packaging and we
got these little plastic e to me they
feel really cheap and very lightweight
not really a huge fan of how they feel
the brush again also feels very cheap
and lightweight
I like the brush end this one is a
little rough feeling for me so we'll see
how this works out
just because I like Kim Kardashian and I
was invite to her event and I got these
products for free does not mean that
she's exempt from me being real and
honest that's just how I've always been
to me I think that these feel kind of
cheap and I feel like they feel
lightweight and I think they could have
done a lot better with them and this is
all the products that you get in it
honestly I'm kind of shocked I just feel
like for that mounts out these were I
believe it was like $42 or something
along those lines or like 40 something
dollars I just feel like there should be
more product in you
there's my this is my personal opinion
well let's go and try it out and see how
it actually acts on the face and see hey
maybe it works really nice me never I
don't know I've never tried it so I'm
gonna go in swipe this bad boy on okay
so it's a nice cool toned color it's
pigmented definitely let's try this sign
I know a lot of people have uploaded
videos on this and I haven't watched any
of them because I don't want to be
biased by the way this decide one so
let's do the nose
I really get into that ring I use too
much oh no we'll see we zoom y'all
in a little more so we can see hello I'm
close okay so we're going to use this
guy and so for this one I just feel like
for me I like to buff with these kind of
brushes so let's see how this reacts
buff and press in buffing for us in nice
I feel like the product totally blended
out like nothing like really easily for
me which is awesome great let's keep
going with the brush side
it's definitely blending there's no
denying it and with this guys I am
blending an upwards motion with the
Kabuki brush I'm just lightly patting on
rather than swiping I think swiping will
give it a more streaky appearance this
Park isn't pigmented enough to like
where you can swipe it and it'd be there
you definitely need to really
concentrate on keeping the product down
highlight numero uno so we're gonna go
ahead and use this to highlight the
center right here so now let's go ahead
and blend it with this little blunt end
right here and press this ya know so the
sponge side is a complete flop for me
guys are not gonna like this one side
I'm telling ya I am telling y'all but
the cool thing about it is that it
really does give a brightening effect it
definitely works I definitely feel like
it's brightening up my skin I'm also
noticing that the highlighting shade is
actually a lot harder to blend out then
the contouring shade and this will be a
guys this is what we have with the
highlight and contour stick you can guys
can definitely tell that I am contoured
I am highlighted here I think you really
need to work in finagle the product to
actually work on you know T no shade at
all I still love Kim Kardashian I still
think she's an amazing amazing
businesswoman who's gonna set my face
guys really quickly with our cement
powder I just like for me personally
it's not the most practical product to
use and it's kind of hard to use and
there's not enough product in it and I
think it's a little bit too expensive so
that's just my personal opinion so now
we're taking another little new guy
we're gonna take a morphe eetu and the
makeup geek bronzer in the shade light
fair fair skin bronzer so I'm gonna put
that on the temples right over the
contour that I went in with oh that's a
beautiful color oh honey
just see that home before our just like
just sun-kissed oh girl I like that
that's so pretty it's a little more warm
that I thought I was going to translate
on the skin but I'm not mad it's so
pretty
you guys let's take some blues let's
take some blues I'm gonna take this
shade right here in V Becca and Chrissy
Teigen
collection I don't wanna form is gonna
lightly press that over the apples of
the cheeks just give me a little flesh
that's a really pretty color Becca has
some really really nice blushes honestly
like you cannot knock their blushes now
it's going with some highlighter
oh the cheeks were looking snacks guys
I'm really really enjoying this cheek
we're joined this cheeky Miss I'm gonna
take the Bobbi Brown sunkissed glow
highlighting powders awesome take I'm
gonna go right in the center right here
on a morphe r-36
we're gonna do a nice little coat okay
guys and the base is done this is what
we have so far I think I'll live it
turned out to be really really really
nice I think the only thing I didn't
really enjoyed that much was the
Smashbox stick foundation I just thing
that I didn't work on my skin type
specifically but everything else worked
really nicely I love the highlighter I
love the blush palette I loved the
setting spray of course gonna Navy had
one for you girl okay guys I'm gonna go
ahead do my brows off of camera because
I have no new brow products and I will
be right back so like I said earlier in
the last video I wanted to try they make
a favor aqua XL color paint as a base
this is in the shade 150 and I'm gonna
use it as an eye primer I said I mean
it's waterproof it says it's a primer
and I'm prime my eyelids with it and
then see how my Prime's wanting it a
real bright base up in this pitch aren't
we yeah okay so I just noticed I got to
work kind of quickly with this one
because it dries pretty fast so work
quickly okay guys so I have to do it I
have to go home with this palette
because it's just so pretty and
I want to use one of those like new
English a doe so I'm gonna go in with OH
I'm gonna go on with the shade buffed on
a morphe 27 of course I'm just gonna use
a shade a buffed and buff that all over
the crease wave ones really I mean this
is blending really nicely over this aqua
color
now I'm take a little bit of the shade
at tanlines which is this more cool
toned brown on the e22 nothing to go a
little bit lower cool tone oh girl she's
really going in I think for the crease
we'll keep that this so far we'll see
we'll see how we feel this is a very
just kind of going with the motion
tutorial it's very just kind of go with
the flow we'll see what we like to see
we want my would you like to come and
get appearance Erin yeah I'm regretting
which one do you like more come on which
one do you think is best
come on you literally have the beat this
is what it looks like you have to beat
it on the same and like interference I
just put a hand out guys I'm not my
brother pick which one he thinks is cool
to go to for the top of the lid on my
purple is the one that's calling to me
the most what do you think you agree
purple it is we're going to be taking
the shade 17 shade 17 huh gosh
like a cut crease with day why not these
are going on so smooth nothing butter
we'll see how these act will see if they
crease on me or not but so far I think
it looks so good they feel a
little sticky on the eye though umm like
they feel sticky I don't know I feel
like they're gonna crease how do you
like that little bit right there is
creasing so um you see that yeah the
skin okay but it is drying cuz it's not
coming up that much on my finger so
that's a good sign so let's just really
make sure that dries down so let me take
a little bit of in the spotlight on a
more feet M 4 to 1 and we're put that on
the inner corner to brighten everything
up and give it almost like a pinky hue
and if you're scared of creasing like me
go ahead and just kind of take up that
in the spotlight a little bit farther on
areas that might crease just to set it a
little bit better
let's take a little bit of that Brown
aqua XL liner it's a very beautiful warm
brown and now taking that same tan line
shade I'm gonna go ahead and put that on
the lower lash line this is very cool
tone for me but I don't hate you need
I'm actually really enjoying this Peter
so we have Safari I think I want to do
like a white liner I don't know I'm
feeling festive aqua excel in the shade
white okay let's try this little white
liner let's try this and see if this
actually works let's see if this will
work see yes pretty pigmented
so so we have so far guys the white
liner totally worked
it totally went on just fine by our
dollies are just not trying to go over a
liner because it does dry matte so it's
kind of it'll pick up a little funny if
you try to do it so that's what it looks
like so far I'm gonna finish the other
eye off of camera I'll be right back I'm
so sorry so what I ended up doing is I
added a little bit of a black liner
underneath it just to give it more
definition because I just feel like
sometimes with white liner it's really
easy to lose the appearance of a winged
liner to it so I always just add a
little touch of black to it always and
I'm wearing the lashes from flutter
lashes in the shade intoxicating and
they are every thing so I won't go and
do the lips and we'll be done and I'm
thinking a new lip is definitely what
we're gonna do
Jeffrey star and I think the shade
Perkins suede will be amazing
look at this freakin chrome package in
God's brownie we think of that
so this is really really nude on me god
damn that's nude bro I'm gonna
take a little bit of Mac spice to go
around the lip just for a little bit of
definition around the lips you can
actually see my lip
and this is the look with a little bit
of spice added to the Birkin suede you
guys already know I'm like that bitch
when it comes to nude lips I love a good
new lipstick it's my favorite I had to
keep the focus on the eyes and a nice
neutral lip and this is what we have and
