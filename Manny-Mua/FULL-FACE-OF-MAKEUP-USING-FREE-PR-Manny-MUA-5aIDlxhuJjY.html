let's go ahead and get into this first
impressions using the PR unboxing stuff
super since we're gonna prime we're
going to prime and I did a boxer primer
we are going to use the essay edit pour
vanishing moisturizer matte hydrator and
primer this is supposed to controls oil
blurs pores hydrates and primes so bold
statement essay bowls amy feels feels
thick
oh my god it's perfume that's a
girlfriend and not like ball it does
feel hydrating on the skin which is cool
okay first impressions I don't feel like
a blurred my skin whatsoever
but it does feel moisturizing and I does
feel like my face is primed and this
product on it to help adhere different
foundations so I do feel like it's a
primary but do I feel like it blurred
out my pores in any way shape or form
not at all not at all okay next thing
we're going try out is foundation I'm so
excited I kept emanating to try so this
is the Mac next to nothing face color
this is one of their newest foundations
that they came out with and it's posed
to be a very very very light weight
almost non-existent amount of color and
coverage that's really not my ml guys oh
it's very its liquidy oh I'm very much
into coverage so I don't know how I'm
gonna like this
I can always add coverage on top it
doesn't really matter but this is in the
shade light plus
I don't really know my shades but I'm
just hopefully that's my shades light
Plus come on fucking pale so I'm gonna
take it on a y6 oh it feels very on the
brush it goes way thicker when I did
this we're just gonna blend it into the
skin oh my god it smells like Studio Fix
we're gonna put on half of the face we
can see a difference between the other
half okay looking at the viewfinder I
can definitely tell at this side of my
cheeks does have foundation on it's a
very very sheer natural foundation
I'm actually not heating it as much as I
thought I was going to so where are my
life at I was gonna fucking hate it and
I'm like so stupid wanna join this but
honestly I'm not even mad at it so this
is super super natural and very very
lightweight I would wear this to like
the beach or the pool not that I ever
wear makeup to the beach or the pool I'm
just saying I don't wear would wear this
but it actually looks really pretty on
the skin like for a natural no makeup
kind of day I will be adding more
coverage though also its oxidizing not
surprise a lot of Mac Foundation's
oxidize on me okay guys so this is what
the foundation on and so since the
coverage is not exactly what I wanted to
be I'm going to add a little bit of the
wet and wild photo focus Foundation
which I tried in my full face using wet
and wild which I loved and I really
ended up liking this foundation a lot I
haven't tried it since so I'll try it
out again just for more coverage cuz
shit I need need that's more like it
so since I came in the package to take
some of the HD concealer make the shade
are 30 that works guys and I've actually
used the HD concealer before and I used
to be obsessed with this concealer I
think it's so beautiful I haven't used
it in so long I just feel like I'm
refiling on with it right now it's so
pretty
the cover it is beautiful it looks so
pretty on the skin it doesn't fall into
your fine lines and wrinkles as easily
it's just a really really pretty
pleasant concealer makeup ever also sent
me a new HD powder this is the Ultra HD
powder and they says that this is even
more blurring than the last powder West
so let's see that's a bold staining okay
let's see let's put that underneath the
eyes feel like the effect is so there it
makes my skin look so blurred and so
pretty on camera but for some reason I
collect the foundation maybe it's a
photo focus underneath it but I feel
like it's making my skin oxidize so much
darker like here literally looks orange
like it's straight-up fucking or
and this is why for some Russians
sometimes can be a bad idea I'm sure you
guys know this by now already but yes
it's need to be careful with the HD
powders because they have gnarly-ass
flashback so right now I'm not taking
any photos with any flash I'm just doing
this for video by what I do if I was
getting photographed with flash
photography like it just doesn't look
good though this is what I have on the
skin so far let me at least with some
studio effects down my neck man cuz shit
cool so now that orange Chase is back I
grab some bronzers I told you guys I had
some NARS ones downstairs I knew it I
knew it
these are the new NARS bronzers maybe
these aren't new NARS bronzers but
they're repackaged because now they're
like this little square packaging and
they look like this now which is really
cool I love it let's go ahead and bronze
using the new NARS repackaged bronzer
very cute I really did not need to go in
put a little bit on my neck as well
because I feel like my neck is looking a
little pasty so let's go ahead and use
barely legal and cotton candy cream as
our blush and highlighters I mean I have
so much - the color pops up I can just
use a lip from there's things I don't
need all the packaging looks like this
it's kind of hard to see the Kylie part
but it's all good so first let's go in
with some blush we're gonna go in with
barely legal
on a more fee for its pigment to me and
there's pigment coming off for sure
honestly I thought was gonna be a bit
more impressed than this and the reason
I'm not that impressed is because I feel
like the blend ability isn't really
there I'm like really having to go in
many many times to try to blend this out
whereas I can use a Beca one and it's
like blended in fucking three seconds
this one I have to be like really
conscious of where I'm putting it to
blend okay so this seems to be going on
better on my left side so maybe I should
retract that statement doesn't look as
bad on here but I do it the this is like
my third layer going into so there's
that close we have the blush on it's
there it's pretty I'm not like blown
away but I mean the color is there so
that's cool so now I'm gonna go ahead
and highlight with the shade cotton
candy cream with a little more feet r12
let's swatch on our finger and see what
we think first
okay swatching the swatch was not a
tainted oh my god I was like really
shook I did not know that me like that
okay well it's right on the face and see
what we think
also bad this is not bad like for real
this is not bad that's a pretty color
dude that's actually really pretty I
have texture I can't speak for the other
colors but so far this color
cotton candy cream is not bad whatsoever
I had just heard so many bad things
about these highlighters what I was
gonna do it I was expecting to hate them
I mean I like the highlighter more than
I like the blush that's for fucking sure
okay guys so the brows are now on my
eyes are primed I just don't know which
palette I want to go in with first of
course we have these guys I'm color pop
we also have the dose of colors these
guy okay let's go with a big Browns
palette by dose of colors I'm gonna down
white that cream shade just wanna do a
look okay I'm actually go in with this
transition shade right this little
fallout but look how much fucking
pigment gets picked up holy shit
like these are fucking painting okay
let's go in with a morphe y 16 fluffy
brush
yes look how easily that just blend are
you for real yo dose you're onto
something with this formula devil for
real
taking the middle shade when I'm working
for three three just be careful with the
drip to fall out because they are so
pigmented like just be cautious of that
this is such a mani palette right now
though like tell me this is not me and
I'm going to get a little bit that
darkest darkest shade on that same brush
and just put it on the outer corner just
for a little bit more definition and I'm
actually take the little brush it came
wait for that one and I put on the brow
bone oh I love colors like this
fuck I wanted to put this all over my
lid but I'm trying to be strong so I can
use a color pop one so now for the lid I
decided I want to keep this as the
crease I'm going to take a new shadow
from colour-pop this is a super hardcore
no it's called super hardcore
I'm not saying a super hardcore anything
it's livid called super hardcore and it
looks like a really pretty champagne II
like champagne so I'm put on the lid
that's pretty and I'm taking that same
shadow that i swatched earlier which is
called egg oh I'll put that on top of
the cream on my yellow and I'm just
gonna press that over it give me a nice
rosy tone oh it's so pretty
oh my god this is vital as fuck which we
did for the bottom lash line I'm gonna
use this color that Chloe looks really
really pretty took a really pretty pinky
peach oh it's so spring I love it let's
take a bit of eclipse on the inner
corner so just do a brown shadow liner
like that just sounds really cool to me
like a dark brown shadow liner taking
that same baked brown palette and a
little angled brush this is a morphe r45
there's gonna be a little bit of
definition without having to do a full
wing and go ahead and wing it out if you
guys would like why not put a little bit
into the fucking crease I think we're
just having fun today guys other way
don't know why I went with that one but
I really like the direction of it man
with that cool well I'm gonna go finish
the other eye off camera real quick
apply some lashes and I'll be right okay
and there we have it now I'm gonna try
this setting spray by pixi this is the
makeup fixing mist with rosewater and
green tea oh my that smells so good at
something fucking Nikita oh my god it
sells I get up I felt amazing but I just
got some of the fucking Nikita's what
juice on me okay guys so for the lip I
have a budget little color pop options
we have to use a color pop one there's
lip products that they have I have tubes
the last of the last things that we're
doing we're gonna look through all the
ultra satin lip scuzz I really don't
like the ultra matte lips that they do
oh that's gorgeous I might just might
pop that bitch on so we have four ultra
satin lip sticks these are the options
right here I think I'm gonna go with
this cool tone one which is so rare for
me me quill tone bitch this is in the
shade strut I like that shade struts
like strut your stuff these are like
impressively pigmented and they're so
easy to apply a king this color is so
fucking pretty oh my god
and yeah guys that's it for the entire
video a because had fun watching this
kind of part 2 of a pure unboxing turn
into a first impressions I really like
how this look turned out it looks pretty
cool it's very graphic for me I like the
graphic liner it's really really intense
and the lip turned up so pretty
I'm actually really really living for
this look as a whole it definitely took
us some like building to get there I
don't really like that Mac foundation of
course is more of a sheer foundation I
knew I wouldn't really like it and I was
right I don't really love it the finish
was pretty on my skin but a oxidize
really really dark and I was like what
oh yeah you guys I love you so much
thank you so much for watching
how goes the night or day wherever you
guys are and I'll catch you guys in my
next video bye you guys
mwah so let's go ahead and get into this
full fresh
but the cat speak I don't know why I
don't even call this video honestly oh
it's a Frankel I thought through the
dirt okay
that was great that was great Mannion we
did fucking great I look fucking
oranga which is not like that
far-fetched when I normally look like
but this is like Soviet it's not like my
normal orange yeah whoa
Wow nice to go talk to go causes
oxidation a king like I
I mean I like to go more ten but fuck
this is a whole new level so let's go in
