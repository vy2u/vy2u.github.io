Chuck me you live okay

wearing like a pinkish like salmon color
shirt I feel like it makes you look more
tan keep on watching it I don't like
it's kind of idiot don't watch
it you know the drill with that but yeah
there's wanna see how I did this look
I'll get you back to the tutorial and
I'll see you soon my darling goodbye
okay let's go ahead and start this
barefaced I wasn't bare-assed oh my god
what am I thinking right now we're gonna
do a whole face today and we're going to
start this bitch because it's hot ass
back in my room so we're going start
with the Smashbox photo finish primer
water look at which I've gone through
like this is a lot for me I've been
really really really liking this
actually so far basically drench your
face in this now we're gonna do is
we're actually gonna go ahead and go in
with two of they make a forever skin
equalisers I'm gonna do the smoothing
in the t-zone area and I'm gonna do the
radiant on the outside of the face
because this is a more of a global
bronzy kind of look I want the face to
be radiant you know I'm playing steak a
small little mount I like to start on
the nose because my nose is like the
most intense part where like I get or
Lee is I'm going to press it into
the face and then I go take the radiance
and I'm gonna do the radiance on the
outskirts of my face like the rest of
the face that's where the reading in
scopes the foundation what we're gonna
do is I'm going to go in with ignores
all day like luminous foundation in the
color Santa Fe two pumps on the back of
the hand I'm trying to dot that all over
the face I've worn this only one so far
so it went on really nicely like I was
kind of obsessed this formulation is so
lightweight but it gets such an awesome
amount of coverage more feet and 4:39 my
obsession from foundations like this is
my favorite foundation brush of life it
just gives a little beautiful like
airbrush finish you know I'm just
pressing it autumn whirl it around my
face I'm just pressing it in because I
want the coverage to stay there I don't
want it to be like moving don't forget
to get your ears too because I always
forget that so now frequency we're
gonna go with the Urban Decay Naked
weightless concealer that one is called
weightless complete coverage that's why
I meant and the color light neutral I'm
should put that underneath my eyes
wrapping is like a crazy crazy amount
organ we're gonna use a good amount I
was gonna do one side at a time so I'm
gonna go and take my morphe g2 and I'm
gonna press that into the skin this is
like one of my favorite ways to do
under-eye concealer because it's just
it's a buffing brush so it really blends
out the concealer but it keeps the
coverage there so I really love that
look at that difference though and I'm
gonna go and take my best semi powder
the best of me translucent brightening
vanilla powder oh my god this powder
take a little bit on the lid like that
and I'm gonna go into a sigma tapered
highlighting brush my morphe one that's
like the equivalent of this is um so
dirty I couldn't even put that on
camera it was like disgusting so I was
like you know why don't we just do a
single one and then I'll link little
more for you on cuz it's cheaper
I'm not going to set the under-eye area
with this powder I love this button oh
my I'm going to take the prep and prime
highlighting pen in liposuction put that
in the forehead clerk shouldn't add a
little bit a very small amount of
highlighting throughout the face the
t-zone and then slightly down my jaw
line right underneath where the culantro
would be and then now we're just going
to blend out with that same morphe a43
name my feet we're just going to press
that in we want to keep the color there
but we don't want it to be too harsh and
that's our
with our foundation brush because
everything that's left on this
foundation will help back that up cool
so to unset this bitch so I'm going to
take my Laura Mercier translucent
setting powder and I'm gonna take a g7
by morphe my basically like my favorite
powder brush of life and I'm just gonna
lightly lightly press that in to the
face I don't wanna be too powder heavy
you know I'm saying I don't want to be
too much powder like just because I'm
going for more of a glowy look I wanted
to like last all day and my ass sweats
like a train wreck so now I'm gonna go
and take the NARS Figi all day luminous
foundation powder I'm just gonna very
lightly take my three seven and run that
on the face to give me that color
because that translucent powder by Laura
Mercier is it's not like it has no color
to it so I want to give my face a little
bit of color but I'm just gonna lightly
press foundation powder in but like
honestly like this powder it is so
lightweight it makes a huge difference
is beautiful Thank You dusty for
recommending that I love it but this
 was expensive but no I was
not happy spending this much money on a
powder mmm I'll do you why you doing
so now for the neck I'm gonna take NC 25
Studio Fix powder by Mac and I always
say powders on my neck just cuz it's my
left you I like to take liquids only not
very much just like it's easier with
powders because just faster basically
the base is done by giving a thin really
am so now I'm going to take the makeup
forever number 20 matte bronzer if I use
this before I'm obsessed I took it to LA
with me and it like cracked at the top
don't want to talk about it like I
didn't don't know if I'm an eye on my
pan so I'm gonna go take the g7 this g7
is honestly it just like my finger brush
to my favorite morphe brushes out like
it's amazing I should really buy it I'm
gonna take that on the temples in my
face I just really like this brush
because it like a nice beautiful
terracotta matte bronzer and I think
it's so beautiful
don't be light with the bronzer bag this
is a summer glowing kind of a serial
bronze love like go ham if you want
let's just do blush right now let's just
finish the whole bucket babe before you
eyes - well um so now I'm gonna take my
blush obsession this is the Becca blush
in wild honey it's like been my go-to
for like everything it's so pigmented so
just be careful I'm taking this on a g5
by morphe and just I feel like this is
so pretty for like a bronzy glow we kind
of look at a good burn apricot color
look at me / apricot if I don't know
what I'm saying this makes a huge
difference with like a bronzy look I
feel like this blush is so
amazing like for summer this blush Oh
bitch it's done it's done done now for
highlighter thought you guys know how to
use this so this is the TLS Sunkist
highlighter oh my god this one I just
feel like it's perfect for a summer
bronzy kind of look so I'm just gonna
take a more few fan brush the 310 will
take that same morphe brush the g5 and
just press over the highlight kind of
just help defuse it I look like I came
out of the water okay cool so now we
have the face done this is the face is
the face look that I'm going for
so it's nice pretty beautiful like
bronze he kind of glowy look and yeah so
it's go and do that eyes net so I went
ahead and I did my brows and base of the
eye off of camera I just did a little
brow gel and then I primed my eyes with
nw20 prolonged concealer and I set it
with translucent powder just to prime my
lids for the next stay up so much I'm
really excited about this lip because
it's gonna be pretty easy I've never
done a look with just for shadows
basically on my channel I don't think
I've ever done ever look like just four
so I'm gonna go ahead and take the more
feet and four for one and beaches and
cream by makeup geek you guys know the
zero power
possum color it's a beautiful transition
for me and I love it I'm chin take that
into the crease whatever I have left on
the brush on the brow bone just a blend
out that she had done easy done boom
we're going to taking morphe m-43 330th
one cuz I don't normally witness and I'm
gonna take Coco bear oldie but goodie
Coco bear by makeup geek it's very
slight amount you don't need a lot of
because it's extremely pigmented and
this is literally just gonna go like in
the crease and you don't need me to new
it because we're gonna go in with the
lid color so don't be don't even trip
like don't trip we're gonna start in the
outer corner start blending it into the
crease
I love the Coco bear because it's a very
warm rich chocolate brown and it's
absolutely beautiful and I just think
it's gonna be great for a bronzy kind of
look go back in with that same morphe m4
for one just blend out those edges very
slightly and then I'm gonna go in with
makeup t grandstand foil shadow look I
love the foil shadow they just came out
with new foiled shadow colors I love the
colors I wanted to use one of the newer
ones but since I was doing more of a
bronzey look
Cranston was the most appropriate so I'm
gonna take grandstand on my finger
that's I'm gonna do and I'm just gonna
run it on my lid
all over the lid feel like the foil chat
will just go on best with a finger all
the way up to that cocoa bear color and
then when I'm getting closer to the
crease I like to just Pat it just like a
way of blending in a way just nice
pretty glowy bronzy look and I just for
an extra step I'm gonna take that
morphine birth to three and blend out
that just very slightly even more just
edges with no additional color I'm just
blending out the edges a number teachers
of tiny little pencil brush and Rapunzel
shadow by makeup geek
that's only one on the inner corner to
really brighten the eye this color is so
beautiful the tech this beautiful golden
champagne I just I can't even it's done
and then I'm also going to it very
slightly on a shader brush by Sophie
very just a very tiny amount like
nothing and that's gonna go on our brow
bone I do not like shimmery shadows on
the brow bone it's just not my thing so
I'm just gonna very lightly blend out
Rapunzel on the brow bone just to give
me more of a glow please for the under I
am I'm gonna go and take a morphe just
pencil brush it's like they're a little
gold one and beaches and cream
I run nominee thigh and then we're gonna
take a sigma e 28 ur and grab cocoa bay
a little bit of cocoa Bay on the out of
Kelowna this will really add so much
nice warmth and dimension to the eye and
make sure it's blended really nicely
just really important death important to
me cool so that's what it looks like so
then we're gonna go and grab mister
right now pencil the colors called Brian
and if it's leaves a nude pencil like a
nude liner for the waterline I've been
really into like a nude Linus with a
water line like I've been on a kick with
new liners more like lately I've been so
obsessed
I'd like this pencil it's so tiny I'm
just like we're not going to do lineup
with this look because it is just more
of a natural just easy bronzy look cool
so I'm gonna do the other eye off-camera
yes was it with both eyes done this is
this glowy bronzy eye let's go up with
some mascara on I'm gonna do the Mac
extended play giggle - for the bottom
lashes this is like the most amazing

get a little crazy sometimes I think to
myself you have lashes you have bottom

so I'm gonna do a very light layer on
the top it's not my favorite for the top

lashing the city and I actually do have
a code with velour now too so I have a
code with blinking view which is still
