Instagram or Twitter and email or
something yeah let's go and get into
this full face using 7-eleven makeup I
literally have a little 7-eleven bag
this is nothing like I'm honestly shook
I'm hunting like what this packaging
reminds me so so so so much of ELF if
you guys didn't see I don't know if you
guys have like ever like bought any elf
items or have went to the store and saw
elf packaging it just rank you so much
of it I can literally take off this
thing and it's enough packaging to me
like it's all the whole black the little
like thing down here the lettering it's
like bitch this out anyway we're going
start off with the face we're gonna use
a BB cream a BB pin here and these
rising $4.99 now we're gonna take the
shade medium just to see so it looks
like here I'll know me shades yeah I
think the only I'm like three or four
shades like it was not a vast thing
that's me you know holy shit that's way
too dark absolutely not absolutely not
thinking light this is the lightest of
them I can always mix them just in case
- like if it's fucked
PS you guys it cracks me up when people
comment like die curse on my channel on
that annoys them and how upset they get
about me Christine this isn't like
something that it's like an up for
debate kind of situation like for me
it's like in my day to day life
I do curse like I just I am that kind of
person like I get upset and I curse or
like if I wanted if I want to do
something for emphasis I will curse so
if that's a problem for you I understand
all good you do not need to watch me and
you do not need to suggest to me that I
need to change or do something different
cuz I'm really I'm really not going to
change I'm gonna continue to be myself
because I want to be as authentic as I
can be as I am in my real life and in my
real life I curse all the time so I want
to be myself I want to continue to be
myself so I'm sorry if the cursing
bothers you
like if I'm cursing in my videos and I
say bad words - is how it is man I just
curse like a sailor in my everyday life
okay
I hate it I think I hate this guys I
honestly is oxidizing pink like
straight-up going mad pink on me
yeah this feels super super heavy it's a
very thick BB cream you guys see the
difference on the color on my face right
now
holy shit okay we're gonna actually just
use only light we're not even go with
medium because it is oxidizing it's just
like the thickest BB cream I've ever
tried it's shocking we think but does
not even get talked you're pretty funny
cuz I'm just not a BB cream person I've
never been a BB cream person I just feel
like it always has looked so hot on me
and I just feel like look so intense and
it's so shiny it's like the oiliest
BB cream I've ever used I look oily like
I look like an oil slick so far I'm not
the biggest fan I feel like it gave me
obviously the creams don't give a lot of
coverage or anything like that so it is
what it is so I'm gonna take the light
concealer so we're gonna take this
little thing it's actually the packaging
is not bad like the packaging of this is
not bad at all basic as fuck obviously
but it's just a classic little package
so we have this long-ass petal this is
in the shade light this truly on and I
mean this from the bottom of my heart
looks like mustard like I don't think
I've ever looked as terrible as I am
right now oh my god this is like burning
my skin this does not happen to me I'm
not sensitive like that at all I'm upset
because like it looks so bad like I've
never never experienced this never had
this it's never done this never was this
okay guys so we try to soak the beauty
blender and it didn't grow at all and
it's still hard as fuck cool
so it's rock hard and this is the worst
one I've ever tried for sure by far I
don't think I've ever tried anything as
bad as I'm pregnant like this is the
probably the worst it's ever been and
it's taking off all my makeup like it's
soaking it all up okay so since I don't
have any a setting powder from there
like they didn't actually sell a setting
powder I'm gonna go and set it really
quickly with my Too Faced ethereal
powder just quickly cuz I don't have a
product from them but that's what that
was so I'm gonna set everything in place
powder is trying so hard to make it look
as good as it can like it is the powder
is trying but there's no saving it like
there's no saving hat we tried the BB
cream so far hated it the concealer
hated it more than I've ever hated you
can see there my entire life sponge
hated it I'm gonna keep it going
and see how much we can make myself
upset on this one also simply me Beauty
7-eleven makeup has some brushes that we
got as well actually comical it's like
comical how these feel like how bad do
you feel I like
killing her this Wow Wow
so let's go ahead and bronze up our skin
we're gonna go and take the assembly me
Beauty son glow matte and shimmer
bronzer this I believe was like four
bucks as well four or five bucks what
you guys are seeing right now like the
powder has made it look a little bit
better than what it is but it's truly
terrible like the powder helped anyway
so this is the component of this guy it
it comes with a little okay this is
actually like really it feels terrible
like it feels cheap as fuck the fact
that it comes with a little brush as a
mirror attached to the bottom of it you
close it and you get like the powder I
think it's really cool I think that the
idea was definitely in there and they
try their hardest okay we're gonna go
ahead and take the bronze this is the
only bronze with a half by the way and
as you can see it's literally red brown
it's so I'm scared okay we're gonna go
ahead and put that into okay fuck the
brushes I'm is go ahead and try to go in
with a real brush that we can see how it
really acts like on our skin like what
is it really supposed to be like you
know saying so we're going on with the
bronzer the bronzer is straight-up
red doesn't blend very well it feels
actually pretty good and it swatches
really nicely that's actually pretty
good but it's literally a red Brown -
it's um
Swiss chocolate from Mac like that is
war I'm true this is turning into a fun
like fuck us kind of situation at this
point like it's so what's so bad like oh
my god let's see save a book on blended
with like this oh my god oh my god it's
so fucking terrible I think all we can
do at this point is laugh because if not
we will crying and I don't feel like
crying right now so now we're going to
take some colored blush we have this
blush right here this actually looks
really cute does the blush looks really
pretty pigmented as fuck super pigmented
oh my word was not expecting that at all
almost too pigmented and usually I'll
say such a thing the blush I don't hang
actually I think it's really pretty and
I should I'm gonna try it out when I'm
actually doing a real glam where I'm
actually set and I have a good
foundation on and all that chick the
pigmented is fuck I know we can really
get somewhere with this blush highlight
time I think we're going highlighter
guys I'm sorry if I'm getting less and
less energy as this videos going along I
I think it's called two feet and I'm
Haley
crying but the defeat is really hello
Reno you know it's like really hella so
it's going try some pie later now we
have a radiant highlighter highlighters
here we have a peachy one we have a
yellow one I think we can make that work
though I think we can definitely make
that work we're gonna take the peach
here one and I wanna see it can't be
that bad I mean we can't do worse than
we already have right now look see we're
highlighting that works that totally
works nice this actually works really
really well
oh my gosh I'm savvy mm-hmm you got
something that works you guys I'm not
kidding you and I see I'm actually like
trying really hard to make this work
like I am trying my best to look my best
highlight to Phil Phil and what I mean
felt I mean my face is filthy we got
these three guys we have these three
done okay let's go and talk about these
real quick the bronzer was an absolute
fuck no an absolute fuck fuck fuck fuck
fuck no I would say if you're in
7-eleven and you're in a in a hurry for
a blush you need something I would buy
this like this for four bucks it's
actually pretty good it worked really
nicely on my skin and I would suggest
this one is the only thing so far I like
and this guy I mean it worked like it's
all my skin at work this is something
that you can just I wouldn't I wouldn't
buy it personally cuz it looks looks
pretty on the camera but in person I
just don't like it whatsoever the Cuddy
doesn't let me heat the chickee uh-uh I
watched cocoa and literally I'm so
obsessed my name is fucking Manuel good
chair is like I am Mexican and I just
grew up and like my Nana my Tata I'm
like in a Mexican household so it was
just like so fun watching this movie
that I was like that's celebrating like
Mexican culture and it was just so much
just so cool just ride me it just
brought me back to like my childhood in
like it was great like I really loved it
and if you guys like Pixar movies it was
an amazing amazing amazing Pixar movie I
would suggest watching Coco because it's
so so good mmm
did that let's go and zoom in for the
brow okay so now we're gonna go ahead
and go in with the brows and with the
brows we have this dark powder and wax
when I brothers showed me this one I was
like bitch this looks like this reminds
me so much of the elephone cuz elf has
that little like a brow powder wax thing
that's like this is of course a lot
cheaper and is cute whatsoever so we're
gonna go ahead and go in with the dark
wax with the little brush we came in
fuck this brush because we're gonna go
in with a real brush like a good one one
that's not an inch long this reminds me
so much
the elf one like literally so much of it
which I used to use awful unlike when I
couldn't afford anything else this
brings back some memories bringing them
back relics terrible I hate it
maybe we got this come on I know our
Facebook like shit but we can trying
because this is what the brow looks like
with just the brow wax in it it's almost
comedy so now we're gonna go in with a
brow powder which is like a little bit
powder on the side this will be dark
brown this is straight-up black I'll go
over to set the brow wax right you guys
the reason I don't like these brow wax
is and brought powdered bullshit shit
it's because it for me it just moves
around so much like I like to go in with
my spoolie and links pulling my brows
out and try to do like the best I can
but with this it just looks so fucking
ugly anyway I'm gonna go ahead and
finish the other brow off camera and
I'll be right back
anyway I probably my eyes off of camera
really quickly so I can give this a real
fair shot this is the matte and shimmer
eyeshadow collection little palette Soho
thing this guy was another like five
bucks so we have this right here looks
like a Bobby Brown shimmer brick so it
said it's a matte and shimmer but every
single shades Ishimura there's one matte
actually it is a very very top it's a
nude these are not like that terrible oh
okay what we're gonna do I'm gonna go
ahead and take the bronzer that we took
earlier we're gonna put that into the
crease so we actually have a crease
color down cuz damn we got shit dude
we're gonna do a quick little bronzy eye
let's go into one of their brushes and
let's take this like all of the green
sheet right here we're gonna pack that
onto the lid I hate it I hate I'm
giggling because I hate it like I am
uncomfortable googler onto the lid are
you doing good
we have graduated from bad to actual
trash I don't see the shadow I mean it
works does there's nothing clear going
down but it's just such a bad like it's
just a bad color it's not pretty the
finish isn't pretty it's like a weird
shimmer blend a little bit of the darker
one under the lower lash line you guys I
feel like with the darker color it's
saving it like I definitely think it's
looking so much better with the darker
color thank you goodness gracious on
this earth okay so we have this on the
eye so far the smokey eye situation
going on let's take
the matte shade my brow bone me me
another mustard color awesome at least
you ever condominum all time and just
what I got also guys they have an
eyelash curler so it's going to our
lashes and see oh you got it here I feel
actually terrible but we're gonna try it
anyway oh and also just this cut lash
curler its freaks me out because that's
like a spring like spring on it I don't
know why it like freaks me out
open it curl totally curl my lashes okay
Chloe work honestly like how bad can you
make a lash curler like I feel like no
matter what you'll at least get some
type of curl somehow okay
curled lashes are done and now we're
gonna go and take the volume and Link
mascara new money new money actually the
wand is not bad at all like has it goes
like little tiny spikes let's try it
let's try it for real for real for real
let's try it do what's crazy is that I'm
not even hitting this that bad it gives
you a major major major separation
they're not it's not right while you
might think I'll get me wrong or
lengthening for that matter it gives you
a nice nice like lash separation see
that okay guys so this one I don't hate
as much as I hate other things so that's
really it makes me happy oh my god yes
okay but the gag is it's like is it that
I'm impressed like I think it's good or
is it everything else was so bad that I
feel like it's good because everything
else is so bad and to compare to you
guys oh my scary is on now this is what
we have so far so it's just a basic run
in the mill not that great mascara but
for a quick couple bucks like it's not
terrible like it's not the end of the
world like I think that you can like
definitely get bite with this one liquid
felt oh we have a liquid felt tip
eyeliner oh fuck oh fuck packaging is
not bad at all
there's a little fill tip I mean this is
not the fattest felt tip liner I
remember seen one this is honestly so
it's like annoying look how fat it is
it's like it just hmm
so we have on our highs right here so I
mean I don't like hate it hate it like I
don't I definitely don't hate it as much
as I hate oh there's product and if
you're in a pinch I would grab this it's
really like it's it's black it
definitely like you can see that
eyeliner on it doesn't like skip so bad
but with a little wing with this I don't
think so like
I guess we can don't hate it
don't hate it like don't him his bad
nearly and actually like I like the
packaging of this is like really sleet
it's like a matte black packaging like I
actually really enjoyed this one I'm
gonna apply the other eyeliner off of
camera and apply some lashes really
quickly and I will be right back to
finish off with the lip and we'll have a
final verdict on this makeup line
we got the lashes on I think the lashes
on helps so much I think it gives it
much more of a glam appearance even
though the look is an actual flop
I think the lashes look great thank you
morphe for the new lashes or we just
came out with lashes by the way I don't
you guys knew that but they're fucking
sickening like they're actually
sickening in there ten bucks
Bob we're gonna move on to the lip and
we are done I grabbed a bunch of items
you're guys let's go ahead and do a dark
lip there's lipstick we have a cream
lipstick in the shade wine I don't drink
wine but for this video I will we have a
lipstick right here not bad like it
looks totally fine okay
smells like crayons okay so this is the
shade of wine and actually looks really
really pretty it took me about seven
layers but we got there and it's full
pigment right now feels super
comfortable on the lips not sticky at
all honestly I think the lipstick is
probably the best of the entire brand
this one so far was nice I grabbed the
other shade Clementine and I got the
other shade of Rouge let's see what
those look like I'm actually really
curious to see what squash like this is
a cream lipstick so these are the type
of you have to build up to be full
coverage which is fine because it is a
cream so we got new Clementine which is
like an orange shade let's see how this
one looks on the hand right there and
then we have this shade Rouge we have a
shimmery cream finish hate it hate that
one hate it
wine is the prettiest by heart okay guys
so this is the final look using all
7-eleven makeup oh my word she went
through it with this one guys like she
really really went through yeah she went
through a lot okay guys all about what
do I think about the 7/11 makeup what I
think about the products or anything
with the brand collectively 7-eleven
makeup was a flop like it was absolutely
no I think it was a Miss Baldy and I was
like even redeemable was this I've tried
and I was looking out with the glosses
as well which I never really got to try
but how can you fuck up a glass to have
that I hope Oh
hopefully it's fine the mascara wasn't
terrible and the eyeliner wasn't
terrible either
I got a wing down I used a
to clean it up I got it on and the blush
wasn't that bad either everything else
was a flop and I need a flappity flap
flop like Oh
flaccid dick flop like la I would
definitely suggest not purchasing any of
these 7-eleven items not just try to be
a bitch but I think that yeah I get that
it's five dollars and thunder but why
spend any money if it's not gonna work
like what's the point of spending money
if you don't have to on things that
don't work and that's it guys that's all
I really have to say I just it was a big
flop for me and I'm kind of bummed
because I had like a little bit of hope
for this one I try not to be mean and
try to be not to be like oh maybe
this'll work for someone but it's hard
when the products just don't want to
cooperate and you really want them to
you know I mean like I can't even think
of someone that would like this like
that's like that's why it's crazy
because I can't even think of like
people enjoying it that's why I'm like
frustrated so anyway you guys I hope you
guys enjoyed it two days of video as
they just wanted to join me my little
Christmas angel don't forget to enter my

anything for love mom
this is no one's color it just looks so
bad I feel so fucking ugly like I don't
