anyway you guys today's video is going
to be a testing Sephora's lowest rated
products video I've seen this video
floating around a ton I honnestly
have no idea who started out this trend
I truly have literally no idea who
started this if you guys can comment
them down below who started this video
first I'll be really really cool it's
just a cool idea so basically what it is
it's going out to Sephora or if you have
products here that are on Sephora's
lowest rated list and it's actually kind
of hard to do this it took me literally
like an hour to pull all the products
you go to Sephora or the website
whatever it is you go to top rated and
you scroll all the way down to the
lowest rated and spectrum of things and
I was like what do we do how do we do
this and they're gonna be like how low
are the ratings and honestly those are
for ratings aren't that low which is
kind of shocking to me at first I was a
little confused cuz everything was rated
like a 3 or higher so then I watched a
couple other people's videos and that's
basically normal so Sephora does it
really have really really really low
ratings of things on their websites I
saw a couple like ones and twos I was
shocked either have never seen him
before in my life
but it wasn't like that for everything
but anyways you guys at NASA today's
video is going to be I'm just gonna be
testing out a full face using really low
Sephora rated product a lot of these
products I haven't even tried myself yet
so I'm actually very very intrigued
about this is basically a first
impressions I have like a couple
products I've tried but not that many
but that's what I'm doing today as
always if you guys like this video if
you guys do not like me please don't
 watch it you know the drill with
that but if you guys do like this video
please go ahead subscribe to my channel
if you're not already and if you knew
what's up I'm Annie MUA and welcome to
my channel thank you so much for being
here come into this den of dreams I was
gonna say den of death oh my god dark so
you guys let's go and get into today's
video
before we get started right hey went
ahead and did I screenshotted all the
products I wasn't using so I can tell
you guys what the reading was on the
Sephora app because of course we're
gonna go ahead and start off with
foundation primer we're gonna be taking
the Laura Mercier foundation primer
blemish list and this guy has a rating
of about a three point four which is
really love for Sephora I don't if you
guys know this but like Sephora ratings
are a little wonky like I was saying
earlier so a three point four is like
pretty low rated for Sephora standards
like the lowest rating and the primers
was like 3.1 or they went to so like
that's like the lowest I wish everything
was like a one-star but they don't have
one star items here on so for its
website and we're gonna try this
foundation out I've never tried this
primer out this is a foundation primer
it's a base I'm quite intrigued by it it
comes out like a lotion that was a
little intense I'm open to I suppose a
little tense
pretty tacky actually as I'm like
rubbing it in so basically it's a
water-based gel that creates the perfect
canvas for makeup and improves the
appearance of blemishes maybe that's why
people write it a low because it doesn't
really improve their appearance of my
blemishes then the day it's basically
just like a hydrating primer that's what
it feels like on my skin so that's what
that looks like
ooh look at that beautiful prime face
let's go in with foundation so for
foundation we are going to be taking the
NARS Velvet Matte Foundation stick this
guy was rated what are you rated on here
this is a three point six which is
actually pretty low for the foundation
standard I've never personally tried it
myself
so I don't really know why it's rated
the rating that it is take the shade
light number four and we're just gonna
go right in and go in this is supposed
to be a Velvet Matte foundation stick so
we'll see how it looks on the skin so
far it glides on pretty nicely I have no
complaints about the glide ability of
here I bet you anything the complaint is
about the sponge like I just bet you
know we're not using the sponge
oh absolutely not honey but spongeable
we're not gonna use I'm actually really
shocked that NARS even included a smudge
in here because their motto is usually
like using your fingers to apply the
foundations and concealers so that kind
of shocks me a bit but whatever we're
gonna go in with that we're gonna put it
on it does lose like a ton of coverage
so we're gonna use a big old brush when
using morphe m-43 9 in classic kabuki i
love this brush you guys know this
though this is like one of my go-to
to apply foundation i just think it
buffs in a very nicely very seamlessly
and as we're buffing in the foundation
as you can see there's basically
a shirred a medium amount of coverage
it's not a lot of coverage whatsoever so
basically it's a lot more on the natural
side which is another reason people
could have rated it lower okay so this
is what it looks like on the skin so I'm
actually gonna play a little bit more
just looking in a clearer
tell a bit that's not oxidizing which is
nice it's when I play it with a little
bit of a sponge I shouldn't go and block
the sponge and then see what we think
okay so the foundation is on the skin as
we can see I've built it up to about of
a medium coverage more of a sheer to
medium coverage you can still see my
redness and I kind of like some
situations peaking through you see the
redness of my cheeks peeking through
however I don't think it looks bad on
the skin I really really don't I think
it actually looks really pretty and skin
like on the skin I would definitely
definitely say it is not really a matte
finish I'd actually say it's more of a
like satin almost do your finish maybe
that's why I was ready to go because
it's more of a glowy foundation but to
me it's not very matte to me we have the
face on this is what the foundation
looks like a little bit up close as you
can see honestly I think it looks really
pretty on the skin it's definitely not
like my go-to like full coverage
foundation or anything like that but on
this skin it does look nice it doesn't
emphasize your pores or texture or
anything like that at least it doesn't
for me we're just cracking a little bit
who knows what the real issue is
is it the primer is it the foundation
okay guys so for concealer we are here
we are queer and we are going to be
using the Smashbox Studios skin a 24
hour waterproof concealer so this guy is
rated here on Sephora site as a 3.2
which is a pretty low rating
it'll be in first impression swings I
really don't remember if I use this
already so we're gonna be using this to
conceal our feelings shade light okay so
we're gonna go and try this out it's a
doe foot applicator feels really nice
going on really smooth actually feels
kind of intense I'm not gonna lie okay
so what I will notice though is that
this is oxidizing a little bit okay guys
so since this guy is oxidizing a little
bit I'm actually gonna take a little bit
of the shade fair and we're gonna put
that right here and mix it with the
shade light because I did notice I
sizing pretty quickly honestly we're
gonna go ahead and use it and actually
the fumes of this alright bit strong
it's a little bit of a stronger step I'm
gonna lie um we're gonna go and try it
out and see how it acts and reacts to
our skin blend it out like a dream but I
will definitely an make the scent is
little bit strong ones out like
great actually I'll say the coverage is
more of a medium I just feel like I can
still see the blue hues right here going
on feel like coverage wise it's not
really there for me I would say it's
definitely more of a medium coverage but
it honestly looks really nice on the
skin it looks really nice and I would
definitely maybe you recommend this more
so for someone guys a little bit more on
the don't waffle coverage side come on
any of you guys so for the powder making
me taking the makeup forever powder let
me set this I'll talk about after hold
on let me set because because this is a
silica based powder and I know for a
fact that this will you up with
flash photography I'm assuming that's
why people did it but at the end the day
to it's like okay this is an HD powder
it's not meant for flash photography
it's just not I mean as you can see it
has I'm putting it on it's probably
bunching up but I probably shouldn't
play off with that what the this
guy would say has a good more of a 3.8
3.7 rating powders is actually really
hard I could not find a lot of powders
out of low rating this is like one of
the lowest lowest rated though but we
have a low rated powder right here and I
honestly didn't think though is that bad
I've used this matter before but I only
use it for video I do not use it for
photography because it does flash back
like a mother okay I mean on the skin
the bitch looks pretty like you are
looking blurred by it my undereyes looks
a little bit darker so I think that's a
little odd I don't know what's going on
but my under eyes are a little bit
darker than the rest my face and look
you can see it is fine we're gonna just
keep on moving around because we are so
now we're going with some bronzer
bronzer was another really hard one to
do like that was a hard one to find but
I do have it this bronzer from NARS is
another NARS product right here this is
the Laguna bronzer and it's not that
it's necessarily Laguna bronzer as a
whole it's this style of bronzer that
may like repackage this bronzer it has
like this like divots and it sounds like
this madness going on rady 23.6 like a
3.6 3.7 and I'm like so I'm like you
know what let's go and try this now I
have not tried this in like the new
packaging like this so we're gonna go
ahead and bronze off the skin we're
gonna see why the this was rated so
 not that great I'm really
annoyed by the fact that I look like
yellow jaundice under my eye but it's
fine hmm so I feel like this going on
it's not
I just don't really like the application
of e I feel like it doesn't go on super
smooth laughter really like I'm
continuously I'm just doing this still
blending and blending and blending can
feel like it's gonna be really easy to
be up with this the reason I go
higher up with my bronzer my contour is
because I have facial hair so I can't
really go like down here which I would
want I would love to go a little bit
lower but I have to like be able to show
it on my face so that's why I go in the
areas that I do go anyway I'm like I was
saying like I'm literally like I was
digging and as I'm putting it on Dom
this da clearly we have a very natural
bronzer we have out of the womb natural
mom over here because we don't have no
coverage okay yeah so that part I would
definitely say is a little bit annoying
and I can see why it's rated lowest of
like the bronzer section because you're
not really getting a lot of product and
it's kind of hard like I get more
kickoff and payoff from my Physicians
Formula one and the color itself like as
it's on I think actually looks really
nice I think it's nice like neutral
color it's not too warm it's not too
cool and the color itself is beautiful I
wish I could actually get more of it off
and use more of it okay so that bronzer
was quite confusing I'm not gonna lie I
didn't really love it yeah that was just
a hard no okay guys so we're moving
right along so this is what the face
looks like so far I think that like on
camera it doesn't look that bad it
really doesn't so with highlighter
actually found this liquid drops by
Urban Decay bees are the liquid Ora
illuminating mixing medium it's
basically like a mix in you mix it in
with things to become more illuminated
but this was in the highlighting section
so I picked it up this has eight reviews
on it and it's ready to add a two point
seven is our first two I think is our
first two rated item so I was like oh my
god I need to use this I said I said
dirty little bitch I'm not gonna lie
alright it's a nasty little nasty little
thing you're tiger
so we're gonna go and just basically put
a little bit on the back of my hand and
we're gonna put that on a cheekbone it
feels like lotion it definitely does not
feel like a highlighter in any way shape
or form
come on a little rough to see it's a
little bit too purple I literally look
like I'm wearing purple sort of purple
ass highlighter it's really not the look
and it's not that blinding either so I
guess I understand the low rating I get
it but I mean it is technically more of
a mixing medium
well you so for the blush I'm actually
gonna kind of combined the blush with
like everything else so basically we
have this sweet peach glow palette this
guy was rated at a 3 point 3 / 3 point 4
I was actually kind of shocked about
like this is such a beautiful looking
palette I've used this maybe once and I
only use the highlighter so I don't
exactly know how the bronzer or blush
work as much my mom's used them both she
really likes them so we shall see what
we think of it and actually that would
be kind of fun because I'm not really
living for this highlight let's go ahead
and apply the highlighter on top of this
base highlighter and see how we look
like right here so okay I mean the color
itself is beautiful however we're really
really layering you guys I mean cuz even
so that's not that blinding it's really
really not I literally don't remember it
being like this I want to live I do want
to live you guys know I want to live a
thousand lives but oh that looks nice on
the nose but it's just not that blinding
it's just more like a an afterthought
it's alright but it's something anyway
we're gonna go with the blush because I
was little point to the middle guy we're
gonna clock the middle right here this
was such a like item in the beauty
community like so many people were like
bitching about this item because it's
not like you don't get enough color
payoff right so even when i'm swatching
this i feel like i just pressed a little
hard but it swatches pretty nicely like
I said on the finger he doesn't really
look blinding necessarily or look that
great but it might swatch pretty good so
I'm gonna go and take the blush we're
gonna put that on the cheat see what we
think this is my third dip going in okay
guys so I would definitely say this is
more of a natural blush very natural you
do have to dig in a little bit more than
usual with this blush but once the blush
is on the skin on the face it's
beautiful it really is I think it looks
really really nice it's almost like
there's too many layers you have to do
with like this is like almost four
layers I just went in with blush just to
get it to be like this
soft dainty looking bitch I'm like now
take the bronzer just a little bit see
if we can add some buff I mean honestly
anything at this point we had more
bronzer
okay well adds that a lot more than the
NARS did the shirt that sure it's
in I don't you guys didn't tell on
camera but it just me added more bronzer
for short
oh yeah that's way better than just a
North one look see there's color okay so
this is the face you guys I'm gonna zoom
in a little bit more I'm gonna scoot in
I'm just really not living and the funny
thing about this video I actually really
wanted to come into this and like just
try to slay the out of my face and
be like these ratings you can get
anything in May
get work you don't mean and I feel like
I'm making it work but you don't want
just make it work you wanted to be
 sickening so we're going to a
settings right now and finish off with
the base of the face we're gonna take
the cover effects illuminating setting
spray was a rating of about a three
point six three point five which was
very very low especially for the setting
sprays as you shake it actually little
metal ball in here I've never tried this
I'm actually quite intrigued about this
so just waiting on my skin in actually
yeah definitely definitely gives it like
a dewy luminous glow why people bitching
about this let's see why their complaint
team so basically everyone is saying
that the product is too glittery and
honestly when I sprayed on my hand I
noticed little bitter flakes and I'm
like okay you know what it's fine just
little glitter flakes maybe it doesn't
translate on the skin and I will say
that there's definitely some tiny
glitter particles on my skin do I see
that white residue at the cap I think
that's good er oh I see on my
hand intensely oh there's definitely
little glitter flakes on the hand I
definitely can tell that my face is a
little more dewy looking now because it
was straight-up glitter on it
let's keep on moving the lung
imma going to my brows off of camera I
could not find a brow product to use
like that was actually really really
hard it I was searching forever I mean
there was like some that were like not
that great rated but they're more so
like brow gels and brow brushes
not really brow pencils and things like
that so I'm just going to do my brows
off-camera and I'll come back with an
eye palette the brow looks so good today
don't know why they just do
so I go like this on my okay I'm enjoy
my brows I opened the mirror and look at
myself this done me up because
literally there are chunks of white
glitter all over my entire face oh my
god like it actually looks so bad oh my
god I'm honestly so shocked I did not
know it looked like that I would just on
the camera looking at the viewfinder and
looking at myself in my own mirror which
is like far enough away where I can't
see the flakes and it looks so
bad anyway brows done eyes pride let's
go and get into a palette so
we're gonna go in with the Too Faced
white peach eyeshadow palette - peaches
in cream collection this guy retailed oh
I mean this guy has a 3.2 rating if they
put one through boom - oh it smells
beautiful I actually really really enjoy
the packaging I love the ombre effect I
think that it looks beautiful
a little peach class this is actually
very well thought out I think it's super
super cute this is the color scheme I
think what it is - the color scheme is
not the most liked but at the end of the
day it's a peach palette like
what you expected
you get peaches how the shadow was good
do they blend what's the tea
what's the grease I don't know let's
just go on and with peach sorbet powdery
bitch huh okay we're take peach sorbet
I'm gonna take peach criminal apiece I'm
gonna put that into the crease we're
gonna make a really just a peachy I
happen okay now this color getting put
down I was a little nervous nothing
right also these shades are so powdery
oh my goodness and I'm down for a powder
don't get me wrong I don't mind it too
too much and the shadow is blending the
shadows are blending so I don't hate it
but it's like the bitch I just dipped in
a couple times and they blend and
it looks pretty but they are not very
pigmented either but right now we're in
the transition moment so maybe that
makes a difference but so far okay we
have a peach crease I love a good peach
crease I think it looks so pretty I wish
that like it got there quicker and I
didn't need to dip in so many times but
it is really really pretty color so
let's go in with you just wait on a
little morphe r39 brush this is gonna be
a little bit of a deeper peach shade
that color is actually really nice I
like that peach suede this one right
here I love that take a Rosie go Rosie
peach so Bryan right here
she's a Ryan but they blend very nicely
like this is like blending very easily
to me I'm not struggling with the blend
of whatsoever I don't know why people
give it such a low rating I mean I get
the fact that it's not like maybe it's
not the best color scheme for them I
don't really wanted something more I get
that aspect of it for sure
however the two shades basically just
blended into each other can you guys
tell if there's three colors on my eyes
right now be honest can you tell it's a
three cuz there is anyway it's gonna
take glistening peach oh that's gonna go
on the lid just feels not that good it
looks beautiful right here I'm gonna put
that onto the lid it's a very like
hardened shade like it's kind of hard I
don't know why necessarily it looks so
much prettier on my finger it's so funny
cuz like whenever I'm doing videos like
this where I'm expecting to not enjoy
something I actually try my hardest to
want to like it like it's like a part of
me that's like inside it's just like no
man you're gonna like it you can make it
works and refine like you're going to be
fine but honestly so
 happens and your we're gonna
try spray it and see if we get any
better result I mean it's better for
sure but there's chunky ass glitter in
this shade I just realize it was like
chunky glitter oh I thought I did but I
don't like it now that I'm actually like
playing with it and going in on it I'm
like I'm taking on the grill on the
grill like bitch who needs a black in
this palette can you give me a dark
brown oh my god I'm gonna ruin this I
like it's literally gonna get ruined
just make it a little bit deeper just a
little part of me it just makes me want
to quit do you guys ever get like that
you're just like this this I
like how my makeup looks I'm over it go
into some eyeliner on this part like I'm
legit getting annoyed so let me go ahead
and do something else real quick because
I'm gonna this is gonna be quick anyway
okay so guys now we're gonna go onto
eyeliner really quickly to do on this
side I'm gonna be taking the hourglass
voyer waterproof liquid liner this has
38 reviews and has three stars a hard
just three stars it's three okay well
let's try it it is a felt tip
applicator okay it's a little bumpy okay
so this is the eyeliner so far I mean
it's just like oh whatever
I'm not a fan of felt tip eyeliner pen
pencil pens whatever because I feel like
you can't get a sharp line but let's go
ahead and try to do a wing okay that's a
little too crazy I feel like this is a
bit pigmented ass bitch not gonna lie
this is a real pigmented in Cod doing a
sharp wing with this is impossible
it's bad I don't know if it's me
just bad at eyeliner or the situation
right now but um pretty bad
I'm gonna go ahead and do the other half
of camera and I'll be right back he kept
on getting thicker and thicker so we
have some sukira going on right now
with the eyeliner and as I use this more
eyes like put the highlighter shade on
my inner corners and my brow bone I just
don't like it I just don't
I really don't so I'm kind of bummed
about it this I know is fine I mean it's
fine to me it's really intense but the
problem is that one it's $34 $32 just
crazy for it a little regular felt tip
eyeliner I don't know it's hard to use
it I hate the felt of it everyone's
saying that it's not waterproof and that
as smudge is everywhere so we're gonna
go ahead and keep on scooting on so I'm
actually going to be taking this which
I'm actually was so shocked
the reading and how quick the reading
was low for this this is the new benefit
BADgal bang mascara literally like a
bunch of influencers just went on a trip
to Utah with benefit to celebrate the
launch of their new bad gal bang mascara
and this has a three stars on the
Sephora web serie my guess three stars
what did just came out like days ago so
I'm like you know what I haven't tried
this yet either actually really cool
benefit was so sweet and they sent me
Laura Gaby and Nikita a package in
Hawaii cuz we're in Hawaii during the
trip but just because they sent us a
cute package and they were sweet tez
does that mean that I'm going to alter
my opinion in any way shape or form but
if it knows that about me I'm very
honest about the products that I use so
I think the packaging itself is so cute
it literally just look like a little
rocky it's like so adorable this is the
wand they're gonna seems like a longer
wand so let's go ahead and see what the
hypernym like it's about like I have no
idea that see it's just a really good
job at separating my lashes like god
damn these bitches are separated okay as
you can see okay so I made the lower
lashes look incredible
my lower lashes never look like this
they separate them very nicely okay so
these are the lashes this is what they
look like I think that the bottom I
should look incredible any think that's
weird that the lashes like the mascara
is not drying down which I find a little
bizarre that's kind of annoying I feel
like if you lived in a hot place and
they were still not dry yet that
would get everywhere like dead so yeah
that was rated a 3 think I mean my
lashes look really pretty my lower
lashes my top lashes it really I mean it
separated them nicely it didn't keep my
curl or anything like that it didn't do
anything special for the top I don't
know what's going to live and we will be
done with today's video and then we'll
go back and I'm gonna test the lashes
again and see if they haven't dried yet
cuz if they did it after the lips bitch
there's a problem so I'm on the Sephora
website right now and the one I had
clicked is actually the mini and that's
rated 3 but the benefit back out mascara
that's like the full size is rated a for
really weird really weird the thing is
for 24 bucks you don't want not too bad
you want it to be good I don't know this
is something that you guys have to like
just take into your consideration I
think that the mascara was pretty good I
like roller lash a lot more how are we
on dry ability at least a dry no witch
anything a lot happier but I can
definitely see myself using this mascara
for my lower lashes because they look
great
so honestly I was shocked to see this in
the lowest of the lipstick product rated
it's very hello it's larrya 3.1 and it's
the anasazi really hills
lipstick in the shade tree in the shade
trouble 3.1 what's the so I went
ahead read the reviews and basically
everyone was saying but this is like a
really deceptive product in the bottle
in here looks like it's like more of a
cool tone pinky Mavi color but more on
the cool tone side right but everyone
says that well has it's drying down it
goes so much darker and more brownish
and it doesn't even become more cool
tone anymore and people are like what
the I look I wanted a cool tone
mommy color and it looks something
completely different on the lips so I've
never tried this before but now I have
to come so intrigued of what the bug it
looks like so let's go ahead put it on
no so everyone said that it's too drying
wash is drying quick holy
the coverage is really nice applicator
is a little bit harder to use because
it's a flat paddle what do you guys
think does it look different to you
honestly let's see how it dry sound
Folio I don't see it pulling Brown on me
whatsoever so I don't know maybe there
was like a bad batch that circulated who
knows dude it looks a little bit
different actually oh man the nose I
mean look anyway let's see how it tries
so it straight down basically fully okay
honestly it is darker it is definitely
darker than it goes on but I don't see
really pulling Brown I think it's still
more of a cool tone purple I don't know
that's just I guess that is my personal
opinion I don't see it pulling Brown on
me a little bit darker but not that much
darker come on three come on a three
that's a low reading that's is my
 opinion though that's what you
 watch it on the floor it's gonna
write fake opinion okay you guys and
that is it for today's video hope you
guys had fun watching actually had so
much fun creating this video it was so
much fun it was actually wild trying out
all these products have such a low
rating because most of them the rating
was actually warranted for sure I was
like it's like that like it a lot of
them were just not that good and I was
kind of shocked that the rating just so
much like reflected what the product
actually did at the end of the day I'm
not living I'm gonna take this off like
I just it doesn't feel good on the skin
it doesn't look beautiful on to me I
just don't like the way it looks at the
end of the day that make a forever
powder it's saved it because it gives
you that like soft filtering effect but
bitch in person this is not that
cute okay guys anyway I hope you guys
