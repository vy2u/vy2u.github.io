so today's video is going to be full
face using only my left hand I wanted to
start the video having no makeup on
already cuz I don't want you guys to
know how I did or not because what I did
 shitty and I'll be really sad
that I really buggins that if you love
me in my shitty makeup so I decided to
just film the intro without any makeup
on so far and I'm gonna go ahead and
film the video using only my left hand I
am predominantly a right-handed person I
do everything with my right hand
right side of my body that's what I do
everything with so I'm gonna be trying
to do my full face using only my left
hand my weak hand the hand I don't use
for literally anything literally
anything I wasn't doing this like
imposing other than that like I don't
use it for anything so we're going to
try to do the full face using my left
hand I'm very nervous I've seen achill
people do this so far and they turned
out so great and I'm like I'm gonna
like I know I'm not gonna do good
because my left hand is so weak I
literally cannot do with this hand
I can't write with this hand I can't I
can barely wave with this hand like and
it's already awkward come on that's
awkward but as always if you guys don't
like this video if you guys do not like
me please don't watch it you
know the drill with that I say it every
single video do not watch it if you do
not like it but because do you like this
video please give it a thumbs up and
subscribe to my channel if you aren't
already and if you're new what's up at
man EMU and welcome to my channel thank
you so much for being here I really
appreciate it join the manniac family
and click Subscribe let's get into this
full face using only my left hand video
the professional uses all the time
hold on this is like my pause moment
because I prime with both hands like
always
so my lot is still prime about oh this
already feels kind of weird can i prime
with using both hands or I have to use
only my left because I don't pry them
with my right hand only you know but you
know what let's just do it so I just
 do it okay
might as well so I'm gonna go and spray
some Smashbox primer water on my face
with my left hand
oh that's harder to squeeze with the
left hand like a child you know one like
a children try to like open something or
squeeze something and they can't do cuz
her fingers like kind of weak now we're
gonna go in with our foundation oh my
god this is gonna plug in this is gonna
be a trip this feels awkward but I did
the no mirror challenge I did more
coverage to make it look like I knew
what I was doing and I feel like that's
kind of I'm doing today I'm just gonna
add more coverage and I feel unsafe
about something and more coverage
left-hand spray but the Vice I have to
give you guys is when in doubt add more
coverage pass to be deep this feels
 wait I was I couldn't remember
how I actually grabbed the buta motor
that was weird okay so pounce the V bun
in oh my god I feel like I'm hitting
myself so hard with this when you're
doing with your left hand and be able to
get hitting your face so hard oh my god
I barely started in my arms already
 cramping are you serious I'm
that weak haha couldn't go to the gym or
something wait you guys had me take a
break is like Lily my arms cramping
that's so pathetic I'm so sorry you guys
are gonna be so in the morning it's -
where - god this is so embarrassing
heart-shaped aim concealer for a
discount challenge you want to use the
parts that you know like work good for
you I feel oh this ooh doing your right
side of your face is a lot that is a lot
tougher honey okay done the center of
the nose okey
mmm-hmm the product is down the product
is down okay we're gonna blend in you
know I feel like the bass part like the
face stuff isn't like too too too hard
like this part is it like deadly I just
I'm getting so source so fast it's like
take mini breaks it's like actually
pathetic as did my hand like so
awkward doing this with my left hand oh
this is this feels so awkward doing it
with this way unless it looks like it's
not even my hand like it's just a little
hand floating it's like the
thing okay bass is not terrible it is
not terrible are see me powder
underneath the eyes don't poke your eye
you're gonna be fine okay there we go
okay cook the face we're gonna take a
poof we're gonna put that on to the face
no it's like a lot hello okay
clean it up coke or I'm just much
more forceful I've noticed with my left
hand there's a lot more force a lot more
power that goes into it slightly hurt
myself a little bit more with this one
Mac Studio Fix powder for the neck this
feels wrong oh wait oh my gosh
of all the moments this is the most
weird wipe away any of the excess powder
you might have on your face like I'm
grabbing my brother tional
stupid painting tantric bronzer by Marc
Jacobs not too bad left side why is it
hard to reach over here Jesus
okay okay got some color down on me wait
what the
try to reach like oh my god like I'm
like look like I'm constipated but cool
so I got recently this little peach
sweet globe palette I'm gonna be taking
this for the blush and I'm gonna take it
for the highlight I get Cory Osito oh my
god it's so cute I love it so
I'm gonna take the blush I'm gonna take
the blush it doesn't have a name
actually I don't I don't think I'll see
your name in here so I'm gonna take the
blush on my morphe for make a little
 weird fangs to find your
cheekbone dude doing the blush with your
left awkward as I feel like a
 peach
oh this is awkward this is verging on
good man we're gonna go and highlight
what this as well you look so
cute who's one years old theme on my
morphe M 510 my classic lo2 glow to my

alright I'm sorry
caveman mode again
not even though I am NOT looking as
polished as usual we're going to get
there okay we're gonna try to contour
the nose as well that's why I feel like
it's gonna get a bit hairy and not hairy
like in a good way like a hot
man Harry I'm talking like Harry like
tranquila Harry or take my morphe why 18
my go-to nose conference this doesn't
have an please
contour goddesses please work
with me honey please God so much honey
then I talk to with me I'm not gonna do
a heavy nose contour Oh idea I'll move
my head what can you do when they come
for you you know mmm it's terrible but
you know what I think what we can do to
really cheat the system is go ahead and
took the nose a little bit just a little
bit like I'm not good of a cook like
350-degree is nothing crazy just a quick
350 so I think with cooking the sides of
the nose I think I can really make it
work so let's go ahead and do the eyes
now and the brows bug browses what I was
like the most scared for an eyeliner
come on come on
it's me fine no I hate it I hate it I
hate it
we're gonna do we're gonna go for the
really bushy brow today
where are you even going with this
manual honestly there's no hair up there
that's happening oh that is happening
currently now let's go into the right
brow which I'm sure it's gonna be much
harder than my left light strokes bitch
light strokes come on we're going for
the Cara Delevingne brow tonight where
am I going the rose honestly
truly I hope you guys try this at home I
really do brows will be cousins not
twins you guys only knew how hard I was
concentrating right now like honestly I
haven't culturally this hard since I was
in human anatomy in college cool
so we have the brows on and by on I mean
we have them as like starting out and
then we're gonna la McKinsey learn or
take Mac Pro Longwear concealer is what
I always used to underline my brows
literally always and I always use a more
feet M 4 to 9 to clean it up oh this is
not cute does this little delicate work
right here picking this up back

hard time okay cool so brows are done

all over my eyes I know you want to be
in the right hand but you can't be I'm
gonna take this right here which is
this really pretty transition shade okay
I'm gonna put this into the crease on a
more 50:27 oh this is hard I
thought the rest of the faces are now
the eyes is our dude hmm okay

baby pukey shade right there I wanna put
that into the crease put it on the outer
corner lower then we have the transition
if that's possible at all and blend out

nicely so I feel like making a little
bit easier for me okay cool

wait how I do it god I grip with my
right oh no Jesus looking hard guys
while I sound like pirate let's do the
base of the lash line first so we have a
guideline
you know it's not that bad you know I
feel like maybe if I clean this little
eye up we'll get somewhere with this
with this wing ok little wing
that's is that this wing is the cute
little we ever seen that's not a cat
eyeliner
that's a kitten eyeliner let's really um
say a little prayer for me real quick
and let's get back oh this is not
happening
honestly on a real level how do you do
this with your on your right honestly
bass is pretty much done with that I
okay so we're gonna this is how I this
is what I don't understand what we're
going to do this I don't I think I have
to bring them actual mirror I can't hold
this I'm sorry why I also do my
headliner off camera because I need to
be really close to a mirror
sorry guys if you can see that but I
need something heavy-duty for this part
my hand when I put this one it's just
like enough my shoulder I don't
know
okay okay still listen honey honey
brother my nose is in the way
god I need a nose job is the wing
perfect no it's not but for being my
left hand I'm pretty you can
never do that already
co-come put this on the waterline
carefully oh my gosh
curl the lashes oh my god I'm so oh with
your left don't even with me like
that is the worst feeling when you pinch
yourself on your lash curler
who here has pinched themselves with a
lash curler comment down below if you
had because that is literally tell me
it's not the most scary feeling like you
like freak out and you do that like ahh
it's the worst I'm gonna be putting on
policy so just put on a quick light
layer wiggle your head you see that
little that video of that one lady who's
like way Kyle your head leghul your
heads I think for today's lashes what
we're gonna do is we're gonna take this
pair that I did like it's like a little
custom pair they're like to wispy out of
corner ones I have like two stacked
pairs of lashes right here as you can
see they're great on the outer corner
and I feel because of my wing is such a
little nugget we're gonna go ahead and
do that to accentuate the wing that I
don't really have suck in that chin uh
that was really lucky
they're on the air buggin I'm okay so
now we're gonna doing the lips and we'll
be done I'm gonna do a
chill lip okay I just did I did eyeliner
with my left hand I'm gonna do a freakin
chilled limp
