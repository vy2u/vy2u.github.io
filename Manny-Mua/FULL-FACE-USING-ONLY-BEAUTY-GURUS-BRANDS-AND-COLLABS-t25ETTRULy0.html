today's video I'm actually so excited to
be filming this video I got this video
idea from miss Laura Lee here on YouTube
she did a full face using basically like
beauty guru collaboration and brands so
basically it's like beauty gurus have
come out with brands and I've done
collaborations with different brands and
she did a full face using their products
and I thought that was such a
cool idea I wanted to do my own spin on
that kind of video and I grabbed a bunch
of different products here that I wanted
to do a full face using collabs and
influenced her own brand products just a
side note I think it's really really
important to show unity in the beauty
community you know sometimes I feel like
community it can be a really really like
dark intense place where I feel like
there's not a lot of support revolving a
lot of people and a lot of like just
 that goes on in our community I
feel like this is a way that I'm trying
to combat that and it doesn't eighteen I
really want to show more initiative in
the supporting the beauty community as a
whole whether it's a big influencer or a
smaller influencer it doesn't really
matter to me I want to show us as much
support as I can because this is the
community I'm in and I really wanted to
flourish and do really well and I'm very
excited about it I think it's amazing
that so many influencers have done so
many amazing things as like the years
have gone on you know what I mean it's
been crazy but I actually decided to
pull some products here that weren't as
like seen or as used as often by using
products that aren't as like
conventional when it comes to like a
beauty guru products you I mean I didn't
want to take like products that are so
so so overhyped and not overhyped for a
bad reason they're overhyped as
because they're good but I just want to
take products out where as like talked
about you know I mean I want to take
some products that warrant as talked
about as much and things that are new
hope you guys enjoy today's video I'm so
 excited if I was i'ma stop
rambling because I talk fast as
actually got caught in my last video
that was like bitch you talked faster
than my Mexican mom when she's mad at me
and I'm like bitch that's fast
you know the bitch is quick yeah you
guys that's it for today's video as
always if you guys don't like this video
because don't like me please don't
 watch it you know the drill with
that please don't watch maybe you don't
like me but if you guys do you like this
video please go ahead subscribe to my
channel if you're not already and if we
knew what's up I'm Annie MUA and welcome
to my channel this is the Manny act
channel subscribe before you go now I'll
be really cool if you wanted to
subscribe here we are thirsty for water
and thirsty for day
okay so let's go ahead and get this
video started so actually I really think
out of the box for this one because
there's a lot of products that was like
 dude how am I gonna do a full face
using collaborations or brands when
there's like things like concealers and
powders and foundations and I'm like oh
my god
primers so I decided to do was actually
really think outside the box for this
one and so for the primer I'm taking the
benefit Porefessional primer it's not
technically a collaboration with a brand
but last year me Karen I left saw de
Nicole Guerrero Jeffrey star and Laura
Lee were all part of a big campaign and
we collaborated on our favorite products
with with benefit so Karen's
collaboration was with professional so
I'm like you know a bitch I'm gonna take
that as a collaboration honey
professional is one of my favorite
primers of all time I use it literally
all the time I travel with it that's why
it looks so up and doesn't have a
cap on it
I travel with primers are hard what you
guys I was like wait how the am I
gonna pull a primer out of my asset now
who's clad with the primer so next we're
gonna do is rent go and grab some
foundation so for foundation I'm gonna
be taking the huda beauty foundation
this is the flow filter high coverage
cream foundation and if you guys don't
know who the beauty is a because like on
Instagram she's a beauty blogger first
she created her own makeup line and now
she has an entire makeup line called who
the beauty of course and this is one of
her products in it which is super super
cool I have worn this foundation maybe
one time because I got the wrong shade
so ever since like I got the wrong shade
I'm like I haven't got the right one so
we're gonna go and put that all so pale
 okay you know what it's fine we're
gonna go anyways in the shade cashew in
case you guys are wondering is it paler
than my shade that's the real guide you
know you guys already know I'd love to
go more deep with my foundations know
what's funny I'm rotting trying to be
shady or anything like that this is just
like a random sign no I tend to do I use
huda beauty that often because I don't
feel like on her brand page or in
general with her brand I don't see a lot
of support in the male Beauty community
I don't see a lot of like posting men on
her Instagram as I see over a lot of
other brands doing it's just something I
noticed so I noticed these kinds of
things that I noticed when friends do
not post boys and I notice when a brand
is very very conservative with their
promotions and I do get it like I do
understand that buying makeup is much
more of a woman's niche than it is for
men men do it too and it does feel kind
of shitty when a brand doesn't support
that or your brand doesn't acknowledge
it you know and I do get say who would
abuse and a lot of us thought is really
really nice but it is there something
I've always noticed and I'm not trying
to shade her in any way she reform and
you know maybe because she does have a
big middle-eastern following she doesn't
want me to get hit on her pages or
anything or something like that I don't
 know so I tend to like not use
her products as much because I just
don't see as much love back in the male
beauty community you know that men in
beauty are not just a fad and that were
 here to stay and that we're like
doing things like oh my god but I didn't
have a lot of options in the foundation
realm you know I'm saying so now that
were pale as pale can be weird ago and
take some concealer so I was like I
was really nervous about this one cuz
I'm like I don't have a concealer that
is like done by a beauty guru I've never
seen a beauty guru clap and do a
concealer I could literally ever but I
remember bitch Kylie Jenner you know I
might be thinking she's not a beauty
guru and I get that she's not really a
beauty guru but she's definitely a
beauty icon at this point and she does
have a YouTube channel where she's done
makeup on her channel so I'm like you
know what we're gonna go ahead and just
count it so honestly like I had to think
outside the box of this one again and
this one is going to be using miss Kylie
is concealer I'm literally taking that
alight is considered a possible I can
find just because I'm already so Kayla
my foundation might as well be a pale
bath bitch today I guess if you all
don't think that she's a beauty guru or
just a beauty world wake the up she
is she's part of it I didn't think I can
go any lighter than the foundation
already wasn't wearing but bitch I
thought wrong so funny cuz I feel like
I'm actually really this pale like I'm a
really light girl bitch I'm a light
bitch but I just enjoy going a little
bit deeper with my complexion civilities
scuse me more about healthier appearance
so now let's go ahead and take some
powder and we're gonna powder up this
face so for the powder I'm actually
taking the Mac X Patrick Starr powder
Pacha start clad with Mac last year and
they created this powder and it's been a
very popular powder in the community so
I'm gonna go ahead and set my face
lightly with this powder here this
powder I would say is really good for
oily or complexions because it keeps
your oils up a very nicely I've worn it
a couple times and it definitely keeps
my oils bitch I'm not let's just say I'm
not shiny after this like when I put
this on bitch there's no shine so we're
gonna use that to set the face I cannot
wait to see what kind of collabs come
out this year I'm very very very excited
to see what different influencers and
different brands have in store for us
when it comes to collabs I'm sure clouds
are not ending anytime soon I love a
good Club you guys I live for a
collab I try my best to support all the
collab so that is what we're doing right
here I'm just kind of powering around
the premieres of my face a little bit
taking off
powder with my morphe two brushes just
like honestly it's like really just good
big powder brush if you guys are into
like really fluffy powder brushes to
apply powder or powder foundation or
anything like that I would really highly
suggest the morphe to remember any
morphe brush you guys get this come with
mani emulate she's a pusher oh my god
like drugs probably y'all know I'm a
pusher
I don't push drugs but I push a code
okay we are now set with the face and
for the bronzer hey gave me some are you
gonna be taking hoola bronzer by benefit
me and benefit collaborated last year
and we did hoola bronzer that's my face
that's my gut eat that I'm gonna be
taking this bronzer and putting it all
over my nose another one that I was like
 like what am I gonna do but we
found her I'm just taking that same key
to brush and lightly bronze ring maybe
rods ring with the bun bronzing my face
hoola bronzer is such a iconic
staple in the beauty community bitch
hula is everything and we have hula
light now get back to reality bitch
you're too pale to go that in right now
usually it's totally fine for me by
forget how light my foundation is right
now so if you're as pale as I am
currently at this state of foundation I
would suggest hula light what took us a
minute but we got there anyway you guys
let's go ahead we walk to the contour
I'm actually taking the k'kaw Beauty
contour hit and the shade light bitch if
y'all don't think miss Kim Kardashian is
a beauty guru she's had some of the most
influential Beauty looks in like the
actual world so she's like changed the
game technically he was Mario but Kim
was the face that launched a thousand
ships didn't take a little bit of that
contour shade I was to put it right
underneath the bronze are just a hair is
really give us that Kim K luck okay we
need to go ahead and just is this amount
of powder unnecessary
maybe how many minutes lately for this
 mmm why is Shawn Mendes so
fired
John posted this I didn't see him right
at this moment four minutes ago the
bitch already has 140,000 likes for a
good reason
oh my god you guys I'm even wearing my
Nicole lipstick NIC merch we got support
all around here bitch you guys for blush
I'm gonna be taking this guy out of you
guys remember this this
actually the Becca shimmering skin
perfecter mineral blush split is like a
champagne split Jacqueline Hill and
Becca collaborate and they did these
champagne splits and I'm gonna be taking
the shade flower child cause it's
literally one of my favorite blushes
from Becca ever and if you guys don't
hold hands on these they're this is
amazing my favorite one was this one
this is the champagne pop and if our
child duo but I thought it'd be really
fun to use this because I needed to
brush it I'm like bitch I eat literally

color is perfect you guys do you know
what I've been watching recently I just
started up all over again Avatar The

the altar no I can't be like that it's
February I have no David Valentine's Day
I'm being cynical ignore me I'm gonna be
taking the Anastacio armor easy
highlighter you guys this
highlighter this highlighter

literally like it goes from being subtle
to blinding in three seconds probably
faster oh my goodness
oh my word I can't like I actually
cannot I don't know if this videos
coming out before the highlighter
releases but it probably is and I swear
to God if you don't pause this video and
go buy the highlighter I will
like this we'll get you there so I'm
gonna keep that at that the highlighter
is on the face I wanted to highlight my
nose and like a little bit on the
forehead with something else because
this was my visa in 2017 this is
the Jeffrey star X mani mu a highlighter
in the shade eclipse this is our old
pres our old thing this is literally
like history this is history so
me and Geoffrey collaborated last year
and we also did it how later name Uranus
like the colour is just beautiful and
it's like the perfect nose highlighting
color and of course as you guys know
Geoffrey has his own brand just
literally like killing two birds with
one stone because I am an influencer
Geoffrey's an influencer but he also has
his own brand week lab you guys so now
we're going do the brows and I was
admitted to brows off camera because I
always do brows on camera because I was
like there's no brow products but
there is miss Laura Lee and Laura's
product was precisely brow pencil she
literally was on the cover of the box
and I'm taking precisely breath pencil
and we're gonna using that on the brows
today which I already
be like I love this Robin so today I'm
gonna take the shade number six thought
is try it out
buck this one's dry now you know why
it's dried up I'm just gonna press a
little bit harder
okay now the product started melting my
skin more I think it was just starting
it out was a little rough though since
Lord did the bra pads I also wanted to
choose a brow gel and I would take the
inacol Guerrero collab mm-hmm with
benefit and we're taking gimme brow she
collaborated with them to do gimme brow
this is one of her favorite products and
we're gonna go ahead and use gimme brow
and set her in place his brow is on time
out we are gonna sit her down you guys
so now I'm gonna go eat some food and
finish other Bravo camera I'll be right
back so you guys are the brows are now
officially honor the eyes are primed now
we're ready to go in with the eye shadow
you guys I've been wanting to use this
so badly
finally I'm about to so this is the
Dominique Lotte palette this is from
Chris's Dominique she came out with her
own brand it's called it nominee
cosmetics I believe it's not many
cosmetics anyway you guys so this is the
allotted palette I think it's
beautifully done it's such a beautiful
color scheme very wearable so I really
wanted to do something with this today
because it's okay you know again this is
a another Beauty influencer brand
product I'm just so exciting to me I get
very excited about these things so you
know I'm coming on my own brand it's
very exciting and it's hard or
seeing swatch will take the shade
caramel we're gonna be taking out on a
morphe m57 6 so we're gonna take the
shade caramel we're gonna put that into
the crease just like a very very light
wash of the transition shade it's a very
very pretty just classic caramel trend
that called caramel for a good reason
we're gonna put that into the crease not
a base color down I really like to put
transition shades down first and then
I'll start to going with heavier colors
and things like that I'm gonna do like a
purple and blue I should the shades
blend very beautifully and they feel
like butter on the skin this is very
very exciting congratulations Kristen
again so we're gonna take the purple of
the palette which is named double shot
and this one when you put it in it picks
up not too intensely it is of course a
more of a powdery shade but usually like
purples and things like that the ones
that are a little more pigmented are a
little bit more powdery so let's put
that on to the outer corner of the eye
I'll take down a morphe r39
blending brush I'm gonna put that into
the crease oh that's so pigmented okay
you guys so with this kind of color you
want to go a little bit more light in
hand because that's the word of god you
will lose it you will lose it sounds
easy to blend out a purple like it is to
blend out like a soft brown you know so
more cautious such a beautiful color oh
my gosh
mmm prep Alicia's Frigga let's just make
myself go Loco
y'all know I've been living for a cut
crease recently so now I'm just layering
that purple making a little bit deeper
now I'm gonna go ahead and take a brush
and carve out so I'm gonna go take that
some of that Kylee concealer are really
really pale shade and I'm gonna take
this this is a Smashbox a lip brush I've
been really loving it for carving out a
crease and just like it makes it a lot
easier for me because it is so tiny but
it has a nice rounded end to it which I
like literally like the palest concealer
I got we're gonna go ahead and carve her
Oh beautiful and I'm not saying cuz I
did it I'm gonna take a little bit more
of that double shot purple and we're
gonna blend the two together a little
bit and get one of a seamless moment
right here and then taking a vanilla
cream which is like more of a yellowy
softer lighter color I'm gonna go ahead
and Pat that and set the white and I'm
packing that on with a morphe M 210
brush nice just lightweight Packers and
like a super teeth to it I think it's
like three dollars it might be a little
wild for this one but it let's go
and take a little bit of cold brew which
is the blue turquoise shade looks cute
it's not sloppy they thought it was
gonna be I really like this it's so cute
I was thinking if y'all want maybe a
little bit of the gold glitter from
Urban Decay and right between the cut
crease and the purple get up a little
bit of a gold flare what y'all think
I just thinking gives it a little pop I
know this product is not a collab with
anyone but I just thought I would really
fit nicely and it does I worked in thing
to transition new shades caramel
hazelnut things like that we're gonna go
and just put that underneath the lash
line I'm making it too heavy of a lash
line the lower part I just kind of want
to keep the focus on the top as you know
I love a good table I'm so peacock II
okay guys I go for the off camera and
I'll be right back okay guys so now that
we have our eyes completed I did
eyeliner off of camera I could not find
an eyeliner that someone had did with
the brand I literally had no idea so I'm
just taking the Kat Von D tattoo trooper
liner come on to yourself is a beauty
icon as well you don't mean so I figure
I would use something in that realm so I
use company beauty I don't want to put
on some lashes and my lashes I mean
we're for mascara and lashes so a
mascara I want to take the Maybelline
big
mascara in the shade black this was a
collaboration with makeup by Shayla
technically it was already out but
Shayla clad ended three colors she did I
believe it was purple and blue and black
and so I wanted to take the black shade
was actually really crazy because like
big shot is the campaign that I was in
with Maybelline when I was their first
male ambassador and it was so crazy and
I was so happy to see that Kayla got a
club with them after me and her were
like the main models of the thing so I'm
like a bitch if it went to any other
person out even livid I'm so happy it
went to Shayla for this collaboration
with Maybelline grassle Sheila again so
we're gonna take her mascara okay guys
so now let's go into lashes and I
grabbed the Lily lashes in the style
Arica so Rika Sato is also a fellow
youtuber here on YouTube and she's also
a friend of mine and she's the sweetest
bunny is just cool ass chick so
I wanted to take her lash with these on
be I mean okay perfect so now we have
the arica lash on bitch if this lash
doesn't cover up my entire eye look I
don't know what does this is such a
dramatic ass lash and I live anyway guys
so now we're gonna move on to the lips
and we will be done we're gonna take
some color pop cuz color pop is known
for collaborating with other influencers
in the beauty space so I'm gonna take
the curvy lip pencil this is a club with
either side of heat okay Karen who I
love so much she's literally just like
one of the coolest most down-to-earth
chicks like I've ever met and I really
really just love her so much and so I'm
gonna take her lip pencil which I have
used before so I'm gonna need we're
gonna go ahead and do a little bit hmm
bitch these shits are so creamy mm-hmm
I feel like a chunky down with this
 lid okay cool now I'm gonna go
in with the ice tower I really want to
use this I'm a musician forever this is
the Aquarius lip cream by Kathleen and
color pop so we're gonna take a queer

pinky Mavi shade I could not do this
video it without using something from
kathleenlights place swear to god she is
a collab Queen and these two together

I think that's it or we're just gonna
top it off with some wham gloss by color
pop and Laura Lee and that is it

video I'm done this is the fall into her
face

sky you guys honestly I really loved on

creating it but it is really really cool
to be able to share fellow beauty gurus
and film beauty influencers or whatever
the whatever word you want
to call it youtubers I don't know
it was so much fun creating this video
and I literally could do this again with
a completely new set of products because
there's been so many amazing
collaborations in the beauty world in
general that I could literally do this
again so if you guys want to see me do
this again I definitely definitely could
hope you guys enjoyed it the only thing
I don't really have that was going to be
a collaboration glitter and eyeliner hey
