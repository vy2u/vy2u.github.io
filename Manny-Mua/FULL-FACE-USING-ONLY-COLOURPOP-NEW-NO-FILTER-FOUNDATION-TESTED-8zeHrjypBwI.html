so excited to be doing today's video
because it's a full-face using only
colour pop and I've actually partnered
with kpop in today's video so it is
special everything I use in today's
video other than the foundation and
powder like all the new new is gonna be
20% off with code mani 20 20% off
yeah on some pellets on some shadows the
concealer dollas ah just want to say a
huge thank you to Clare pop for partner
with me in today's video it's going to
run for one week today it is Sunday and
it ends next Sunday so you guys have one
week exactly to use the code at mani 20
and you guys get to buy any of these
products from colour-pop that I'm gonna
be using today's video or linking down
below I was really really excited
because cutter pops already a really
really affordable brand so when they
reach sound-alike he would love to give
you a code for 20% off I was like 20%
off more all right this is the first
video I'm putting up since I did my
video with my dad making a video is hard
being on YouTube is already hard enough
with the criticism and putting yourself
out there is so so so hard for my dad to
come on here to do a video for the first
time and be so candid and honest and
open I'm so proud of him and I just want
to say thank you to everyone that has
sent him so much love and support and
seeing him do that video I've never been
more proud of my dad in my entire life
so I just want to say thank you guys so
much for the love and you have no idea
what it means to me and what it means to
any family and that video makes me want
to be more candid with you guys and talk
to you guys more about you know issues I
haven't issues I've been going through
you know the other day I filmed the
video just with my little phone in front
of my bed and I just kind of talked to
you guys about some things I've been
going through the past couple months
I never uploaded it because I was scared
maybe I'll put it up maybe I won't who
knows seeing you guys's reaction has
made me so happy and I just want to say
thank you again yeah that's going to
tase video I'm gonna stop being sappy
and adore cuz that's what I'm being
right now you know what dork means whale
penis I know I know okay anyway it's
going to get into today's full face it
using only
colour-pop video
but this entire bag right here I filled
it up with colour-pop goodies the only
things that are not on sale that do not
get 20% off one are the collaborations
which I wish I wish I could've used the
clubs in this video Kyle of color of
collabs with other influencers so much
but also the foundation and a B powder
these guys just came out so they do not
count for the discount code I apologize
for that one but I'm gonna use them
because I'm very very excited to try
them out I've been so so dying to try
the new color pop no filter foundation
because I really really really like
their concealer so I'm like okay this
has to be like cute right like it has to
be adorable though shade like 40 you're
like no like 50 or like 45 for this guy
I'm pouring it out and it's a very very
liquidy as you can see it's running it
is running like a triathlon
sweetie you like okay calm down we're
just gonna mix the shade 45 and 50
because I really don't know my shade on
this one and then the PR I got a little
nagging we're gonna go and mix these bad
boys up so little yellow it's a little
bit yellow for me but honestly I just
use 45 let's see 45 by itself I think 45
by itself a probably the best but it's
so light honey
that's real light for me and you know I
like to go more tan I'm taking a little
beauty sponge I'm just gonna use the
combination that I mix it's looking so
pretty
and the coverage is a really nice prop
how do y'all do this dude how do you all
do this is what I would like to know
gamma with the combination I mixed 45
and 15 which is like girl you definitely
know how to mix them but like I got a
pretty good shade match it's definitely
I would say it just a hair yellow and I
feel like I'm definitely on the neutral
side when it comes to complexions
because I do get a little bit red which
makes you look pink but I definitely
have a lot of yellow undertone in my
skin too which makes me look yellow I
don't like oh my god what am I Who am I
23 and me now or 23 means scam like she
doesn't sin and take this concoction
down the neck honestly so far you guys
let's see let's do a real zoom in but
honestly well I'm just looking so pretty
though I didn't prime God dang it I
didn't prime oh my gosh this is looking
this good without primer where the
the finish I would say is definitely a
satin finish has a nice medium to full
coverage definitely not sheer by any
means but definitely not too full either
to me at least the finish is really
really pretty okay now we're gonna go in
with the concealer which does count for
the menu 20 hi I'm so excited that this
is part of the favorites of sale taking
the shoe into light
and I'm putting that underneath my eye
it has more of a pinky undertone I just
think that's gonna look prettier with my
darkness I have hiding there you know I
feel like very Voldemort in the guy's
head you know underneath the turban like
hiding the darkness for real like very
that okay we're taking the same scene
I'm putting it in the middle areas I
really like this can see it was like
it's so lightweight but it has it such a
nice amount of coverage like it's really
nice and so inexpensive I'm gonna blend
that in and see what we get it blends
like a dream sleeping beauty ain't honey
this is an excessive step for me this is
just something I wanna do Presley I'm
gonna be taking the nofilter shaded in
the shade white you guys if you're
looking for a white concealer that's
actually bomb as hell that's not gonna
break the bank you guys check out the
white Club top consider honestly it's so
good we're taking a little bit of the
white one I was gonna put it right by my
inner corner like right here because
it's gonna brighten everything up it's
not gonna actually look white I promise
you though we're just gonna highlight
the inner corner a bit more you know
what I actually started doing this after
watching drag race the most recent
season of drag race aquaria was a queen
on drag race a beautiful talented
stunning queen she does this like really
pretty white like right here and after
singer doing I was like and honestly it
just looks so cool that's so brightening
it's very drag definitely not a
necessary step but I thought it would
just be really pretty and I want to show
you guys that the white blends out
really easily it's not like so like
stark white only or you're like oh my
god I like it so why I can't link
breathe you know I know of course other
queens do it as well but seeing aquaria
do it and her like in her nose area
right here I was like I'm sold
she sold me facts are facts America now
I'm looking like a ghost don't you deny
it don't you deny it now we're gonna
take some color pop no filter setting
powder come on really just come from
blood out here this part sadly does not
count before the discount they just
launched it so let her have it let them
breathe let the bitches breathe okay
after you tweeze my eyebrows so what I
have right now or not even brows they're
actually caterpillars it's a kiss a
translucent we're gonna take it on the
same sponge I want to put that on the
face and we'll see what we get Angie
it's really pretty with this powder has
a little bit of color that's making my
foundation underneath slightly darker
than when I started it with it does
oxidize slightly on the skin so just
look what I'm noticing right now from
with what I'm wearing
honestly you guys on the skin the powder
looks you can see right there just
making it slightly darker when I go over
it with the powder not a lot at all I
just notice it's subtly you guys so what
I like about this powder I feel like
it's not a heavyweight powder whatsoever
it's such a lightweight fine powder like
it's not intense at all I'm gonna go in
and bronze now I'm gonna take the shade
a medium dark from the no filter sheer
pressed powder also a new product the co
doesn't count apologize for that one but
I'm just gonna bronze up the skin with
this just lightly oh that's pretty
it's like a lightweight very just sheer
wash of color okay so this powder I can
tell because it is so sure and so
lightweight of a powder this is more of
a I would say the more of a blotting
powder and definitely does not have a
lot of coverage tomorrow veil I would
say it's such a light weight wash of
color it's not one that you like to
start off right away any it's like boom
pigmentation boom intensity it's like
one that you build slowly and gradually
which I actually really like I think
it's so pretty on the skin oh this is
really nice now I'm starting to get both
a lot I mean I can't get me taking it
we're gonna blend that out
okay look am I gonna do to you I don't
really know I know how much you guys
love when I do a copper I knew delay I
know how much you love it okay so next I
want to talk about these guys really
quickly these are part of my favorites
for the club pop video like this is like
something I've been like dying I don't
advise I've ever heard of these I hope
you guys have these are the super shock
cheek highlighters these are incredible
the two shades I grabbed or the deal
these are my two favorite colors that
they have are spoon and wisp oh like are
you kidding this is what it looks like
right here that is wet honey and then we
have wisp
which is like the more golden version of
it so I just wanted to show you guys
whispers well golden stunning goddess
bronze so with these two you guys can
use the code mini 20 to say okay I'm
gonna take it a little bit of spoon on
my blender I'm gonna lightly press it
into the skin lightly because I'm gonna
go in with more intense highlighter this
is just more of a base 90 girls do you
guys see how it like just adding that
just it's like a little pop of something
that's nothing too crazy but I love to
use these as basis for another
highlighters so we can go in with two
other highlighters we can go in with the
luster dust and the shade know me which
is my favorite luster dust it's
incredible or we can go it with the in
nude and oh this is actually why we're
gonna go in with because I really
wanted to talk about this in today's
video this is it right here this isn't a
highlighter palette that they came out
with and I think it's so so good y'all
but just come in for blood huh for the
price point it's such a really just
gorgeous palette those are the top three
shades gorgeous copper like we just if
y'all want a highlighter palette
that's gonna slay y'all's lives but
wrapped in that so and nude endo don't
take the shade on the loose and glad you
came and go over this bitch I mean of
course it intensifies it because I have
spoon underneath it but look are you
guys seeing I literally look like glass
and I got a fat ass it is what it ends
oh it's so pretty and these are not like
chunky these are just really high shine
and gorgeousness this is this I don't
know what it is I think sometimes when I
get really hyper the Spanish the meghana
comes right out of me and I don't know
what it is I don't speak Spanish you
guys I am such a whitewashed Mexican I'm
like a coconut brown on the outside and
white on the inside by it I'm never on
that side and I'll buy no coconuts
anyway so this is the face so far are
you actually kidding right now with the
globe let me just show you guys what the
luster just looks like this is like that
bitch it's so intense though like this
is no me like it's literally one of the
brightest most intense highlighters and
I would definitely say it more for a
lighter complexion is what I would use
know me for it because honestly it is so
bright or just dunk into this a little
bit and just you already see literally
right there that spot my camera can't
even pick up the texture because it's so
blinding seriously the foundation looks
so pretty
the sheer powder same thing the
highlighters I knew I was obsessed with
those aren't in my favorites unless I
put them in there because I'm blinded I
just honestly I just want to be Chloe
today and glowy and bronzy like I'm not
even gonna go in with any blush we're
just gonna do a glowy bronze II got it
if that's okay with you guys it's okay
because this is not alive and I say it
is as if you guys had a little bit more
to say yes and see exactly the face the
mug get into this gig so now let's going
go in with the brow and I'm gonna be
taking this product this is the brow
pencil and a shaved black Hannah brown
this is 20% off and I honestly think
that these
little bear pencils are so great for the
price point I honestly think that
they're great like they're incredible
and I think that for just a cute little
brow pencil it's so pigmented and it's
so intense like girl did you like do you
see how pigmented this is are you
kidding mm-hmm
actually crazy because I use a actual
pencil and so long I've been really
using like brow means so now right now
I'm just itching out where he want my
brow to be these pencils are so freakin
pigmented oh my like every time you
usually forget like you know when you
get into like a thing when you get into
your own routine you start using your
things for example I use like plumb
means right now then you use like a
pencil like this and I'm like oh my god
it's so intense and so pigmented like
why don't I use it more she's seen some
things you know I'm getting crazy any
stuff any stop and this is the brow with
just the pencil and it looks freakin
great I'm gonna go ahead and set that
little bad-boy with this cute little
brow boss jail okay it's White's but it
goes on clear oh I could feel it in the
brow like it is hair gel honey this
isn't moving this is not budging she
said like look at the difference look in
my face okay look I'm gonna go finish
the other brow off of camera and I'll be
right back alright the brows are on and
the nose is cooking honey and the face
is still beat I just pry into my eyes by
the way with their concealer and I said
it with the translucent powder I'm using
the translucent powder on the sides of
my nose we're going along your eyes
we're getting this done you guys so
now we're gonna go in with a palette I
chose B give it to me straight pout
because honestly I just like this
palette can do it all for the average
person is someone that just kind of
wants to do like a really prick a prick
but for someone else to do it really
pretty quick on the go I mixed pretty
and quick and I said prick
okay and I also grabbed the Golden State
of Mind palette cuz I don't think this
is a gorgeous one this is all lid shade
these are all very intense foiled shades
i'ma show you guys a couple over here
these are like kind of are like bitch
they're foiled shimmery shades that's
these the Golden State of Mind the whole
palette is like that doesn't you guys
know if you guys want like really
intense foil chains we have those but I
also have some singles as well so in
case you guys are curious why my
favorite products from colour-pop are in
a box still it's actually because they
resent them all to me in one box so I
can have them all together to be able to
be like okay these are my favorite
products these are the ones I'm using in
the video just so we're all on the same
page so I'm just gonna shake
guys some of my favorite super shock
shadows because these are little this
nose gets it suck it in like this so
have a couple shades right here that I
just think are so pretty
birthday cake oh these shades are red
like it's literally baffles me every
time I swatch a color pop shadow like
Wow Wow glitterati I'll show you guys
right now hold on you give me a second
I'm gonna swatch the four I've ones one
swipe on each finger so far we're gonna
take the che in a stereo which is
literally mmm we're gonna take the
lashing I have here which is partridge
these are fortunes I kind of want to
show you guys we have birthday cake
right here glitterati partridge and
stereo right there are these four shades
they're all gorgeous they're also highly
pigmented they're all intense they're
all full coverage as hell it just it is
what it is also at Hegman can wait let
me show you guys these two as well we
have hammered which is a really cool
green which is like shocking because I
don't really do green very often but
this is the shade right here it's like
an olive with gold undertone it's
beautiful and the shade frog which is
like a glittery dream a glittery dream
let's go in with you give it to me
straight
I mean it could've been called give it
to me gay but well good throw a the
shade down right which is like a really
pretty neutral
pinky transition shade and then mix it
in with truth hurts that it does we're
gonna go in with a transition shade
honestly color pot little palettes are
so practical and just so pretty and they
impress me every single time I like go
in with them and I'm like dude they are
so nice like high quality but low price
point I don't know they knew it but I
love that they do it because it's
awesome for you guys it's awesome for us
you know as a consumer to be able to see
high quality amazing products I like a
low price point I'm just mixing those
shades again together take a little bit
of BS and TMI as well which are like
really warm Browns hmm oh I'm so ready
for y'all to clock me on this love dome
man you do the same look all the
damn time no honest you guys okay
honestly tea tea tea tea tea that I am
definitely trying to branch out a little
bit more with my looks you know I'm
trying to be a little bit more creative
with my looks I used to be so so intense
what it looks like I used to do like I
used to be so intensely creative all the
time and I would do crazy
looks all the time see the thing is I
live for a bold eye and a neutral lip
that is my go to that is my heaven that
is my safe place and I think that people
really like to kind of come for other
Beauty youtubers it's not just me it's a
lot of us for doing neutral looks if
people be like oh you're not talented
because you only like to do neutral
looks so because someone feels
comfortable doing something natural and
not as colorful and bold all the time it
doesn't mean that they're not talented
actually so just kind of like one of
those things where it's like don't knock
someone's hustle and the way that they
work and how hard they work and their
skill just because you don't like the
way that they do their eye makeup all
the time even though it is done really
really well so now I'm going with this
shade Partridge which is like a really
pretty like a bluish greenish brown
undertone shift I'm gonna go on my
finger and I'm gonna go that all over
the lid I think that they just work best
on a finger to me personally I just
think that they have the most intense
lively full effect as you can see it's
looking so bold and so intense okay so I
used to watch Jacqueline Hale of course
and I mean I still watch it of course
but like back then I was much more of a
like when I wasn't even on YouTube yet I
would like watch her watch her tutorials
and I loved watching Jacqueline's
tutorials cuz they were just so fun and
I would actually learn a lot from them
because she was such a great teacher
still is of course but she really just
taught really really nicely and I had
loved watching her videos I remember she
did a look my go-to clubbing look and
she used like blue brown pigment and she
was like brown script and she was all
these random shadows from Mac I remember
I went out and I bought all those
shadows from Mac so I could recreate
that same look this one I was a waiter
so I didn't like really have too much
money but I went out and I bought all
those shades and this look just kinda
reminds me of it I don't know if you
guys remember that video or not but I'm
actually gonna link it down below if you
guys want to see it it's just funny you
know it's just funny how life works like
that you know and now I can take
Jacqueline's one of my close friends
it's so weird back in the day I wanted
to be Jacqueline's friend and I wanted
to be a beauty person on YouTube but I
wanted to do all these things and I want
to have a brand and I wanted to be
people and explore the world and all
these things I have been able to do and
I've been so blessed and so lucky to be
on YouTube and YouTube has brought me
all these amazing things and I cannot
thank YouTube enough as my dad said in
the previous video he said thank you to
you guys for being there for me when my
family wasn't there for me and it's true
my family wasn't you know if you guys
saw a video you guys know that I
struggled for a very long time for a
very very long time and it didn't happen
to me overnight I worked for years and
years I worked really hard really hard
and really diligently to get what I have
right now and you know I'm still not
perfect not fully happy with everything
and I still get sad and I still have my
mental issues I deal with every day
working hard will get you through those
things people will see the hard work and
be like wow they really did that they
tried and so even if people like kind of
come for you and they say that you're
not talented or they say that you don't
deserve the things in the Hat because
you've been involved with drama it's
like ooh and what does that mean
I've been involved with drama who hasn't
been involve a drama in their life you
know what I mean it's just crazy that
like people online they love to project
this like weird crazy facade on to other
people but I'm like girl that's not who
I am I'm just rying to be the happiest
me I can possibly be so I'm going to eat
that eyebrow pencil that I used earlier
and I'm gonna put that into the
waterline and on the outer corner and
into the lashline and if I have this
brow pencil which is a nice dark brown
why not
multi-purpose it you know I'm playing
just remember that when you want things
to happen you got to make them happen
for yourself I love this I feel like
we're going really grungy today like
really really really grungy just really
dragged her out honey this is so pretty
I love this look oh my god like I really
love this okay I'm gonna go ahead and
finish the other eye off of camera and
do my lashes and get this done and
I'll be right back okay so the eyes are
on they are done honestly I love how
this look turned out I just think it's
really pretty I love a warm crease with
a really bold intense like under-eye
super smoked out it just looks super
cool okay guys so now we're gonna move
on to the lip product a couple of my
favorites right here so I wanted to just
kind of bring out a couple products I

just want to say that because I think
that this is super cool if you guys

expensive ass like Z palette for example

shadows this one I haven't here is lay
