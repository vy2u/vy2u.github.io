so is video is going to be a fun
different more unique one I wanted to do
a full face using all Halloween makeup I
went to a store and grabbed a ton of
different Halloween makeup from the
literally Halloween store it's a grant
this random one a Hollywood when it got
some Halloween makeup there's tons of
different that they have there and I
thought it'd be really fun to doing like
it kind of like a normal Beauty glam
look using all Halloween makeup like
there's no foundations there's no
nothing like that it's literally like I
have like cream paints I have like cream
paints I'm gonna try to mix and get a
foundation shade from we'll see how it
turns out I don't really think you know
but I think it's gonna be really really
really really fun and if it turns out
like a flop you know what it's all good
and that's what a challenge is for also
if you can see my background is a little
bit different my mom thought it would be
kind of cute to deck out my backdrop so
she did a little she got all these
little goodies and everything we're
gonna take this one I don't because I
don't like it so yeah you guys we're
gonna do today we're going to do a full
face using all Halloween makeup I got

now that we've got that out of the way
let's go and get into this video
you guys we got this monster value
makeup set right here one monster all Oh
monster and it's a litter it was seven
bucks so it's not too bad of a deal so
pretty that's a pretty good deal
actually because we clean paint so I
figured what I was gonna do for effect
my foundation and I want to combine that
some cream paints to like make my like
right color foundation shade let's see
if we can make that happen
I don't really know so let me just open
up this real quick okay guys so we
have our little cream palette right here
and we have our little mixing palette
that we're gonna be using here so we're
gonna take some white cuz mommy the
white ass bitch oh this is like
really creamy okay so we're gonna take
some white yeah how much do we take I
have a big face whatever or take a
little bit of brown I'm not as ghostly
is worth you guys are thinking I'm gonna
go a little bit of brown take a little
bit of pink take a little bit of yellow
or yellow undertone now we're taking a
little bit of green like a hair a
smidgen I think these are like the cars
that you mix for a foundation is what we
look like this is our cream color okay
we are giving a color that does not
resemble a foundation whatsoever holy
 I'm gonna be so dark after this
okay that's gray cool we have gray no so
we mixed yellow white a little bit of
pink a little bit of green and some
brown and we have this color we have two
going on right now which is not as bad
as it was okay guys we're gonna do this
I need it kinda not be like kinda eat it
but it's fine it's for the video how
funny this is gonna make me look so dead
but that's probably gonna match my face
better than what I normally match it to
that's the dark side guys that's the
that's the sad truth
oh my god I can ugly this is kind of
working what we instantly know it's a
machine guys I know but I'm not like
hating ya know I am I mean okay now
we're gonna go and Pat it in with a more
py6
oh this was so nasty like I don't think
you guys understand how bad this feels
on the skin and now we have to conceal
that so we have to conceal conceal our
feelings you know I'm just kidding you
expressed feelings do you want you we're
in take a little bit of the orange the
white and the pink maybe a little bit of
yellow too
 this is hard it's more peachy cool
why we got a little bit of a wider color
we're gonna go and put that underneath
it is you what this feels like
underneath my eyes it feels like Greece
feels like I'm about to start cooking a
 chicken
that's real yellow I didn't mix that
part well whoo we're gonna blend it all
in together guys and see what we got
here was just a terrible idea
maybe maybe let's take a little
applicator a little sponge applicator
from the thingy and put that anything I
just blend that in we have no harsh
lines or edges cuz we want to look
smashed hunty okay why am I feeling so
Kent now we're gonna contour taking our
palette again we're gonna take a little
bit of brown a little bit of gray a
little bit of gray is I'm getting scary
let's mix up stick it in see what you
got okay that's a little more cool toned
like we're getting someone here guys
we're getting somewhere
mix it on our finger right there right
now this one we're just kind of more of
a it's more of a prayer we're gonna pray
to his stools that just turns out better
than we think it's going to she rough
she rough for sure I can't tell if it's
the product that's patchy what is well
that's a that's a fact it's patchi's
 and it's coming off but my skin
also has patches that don't pick up on
product this is the harder part right
here that blends it's so much nicer okay
on the way I'm gonna try and even do
something else oh that's cocky top round
that is cookie that Brown for sure
good blend we're gonna use a brush to
blend guys cuz a brush with this I've
noticed works the best as we can see any
worse than best this is
literally so funny like I cannot handle
this right now we take a little bit of
the pink and mix it with the red a
little bit gonna make that our blush
okay that's really good me dude that was
really good me dude more so then I can
blend out with the brush this is a brush
that heals all this is the brush that
heals it all oh she looks a wing I like
that guy is she cute we have other
makeup stuff we're gonna use for the
highlight what we'll go back to her
we'll go back to her uh-huh
okay guys so I just forgot I had this
but we have eight glitter set so we're
gonna use this as our highlight
or days a little good about wearing use
this shade right here it's a glittery
yellow we have to roll the punches your
guys this isn't one of those moments we
have to really roll we're really testing
our scowl
so we're you're using this uh iridescent
yellow green glitter oh oh so the only
the top layer has glitter oh not even
the base wow this is so rough no it was
everything was going so well okay so we
have the highlight on it might be a
little intense for some of us some of us
maybe not some of us maybe so this
carita is looking snatched by just
volume on downstairs when I was emptying
my memory card and she said Wow and the
funny part is like the worst part of it
all actually he's actually said that
this looks better than some of the
foundations that I've worn in past so in
case you guys didn't know my mom's
actually you savage and she hurts my
feelings sometimes and I just had this
one hit eighth wanna constantly know
just try it
oh so we are don't the face guys I think
is all I can really do I don't really
have any more option buy it we're gonna
go ahead with on to the eyes now and do
something sickening yeah okay guys so I
got these little crayons that came with
the kit came in the kit
I'll see maybe I can use the black one
for the brows we'll see how it goes
let's just try it guys we're actually
trying to look sickening
do not forget sickening is the goal
we're not trying look like a full up
I'm just take any little spli and splay
out the greasepaint that's in my brow
right now you guys a memory guard
to this as if I wasn't like already
 okay guys we got the brows on
okay so now we're gonna do the eye
makeup guys this is where we're gonna
it's gonna get a little hairy ah dude I
don't know what to do with this okay
we're gonna take black we're do smoky
eye we're gonna take black cream paint
from our little cream thing I'm gonna
make this is our black base for a smoky
eye
we have black let's take a little bit of
brown above that should we be using
brushes for this I think taking the
brown paint we're gonna put that right
above the black we're a blend on this
little fluffy brush the brown cream
paint into the crease and blend her al
hunty and if all else fails you can
blend with your finger which is nice as
well what I recommend going out like
this probably not we have a smokey eye a
little bit more black on the middle in
we're gonna take this glittery shade
with that right on top to give us a halo
why I guess Oh
we're gonna put the glitter all over the
lid that's organ do you um what I
recommend doing this no because this is
some random-ass glitter from the
Halloween store is this safe I don't
know but I'm willing to risk it for this
video also all the glitters are the same
like you're tricking me you make me sing
others pink glitter and green glitter
and multi duo glitter they're all the
 same as you can see on my eyes
get a pencil
we have a pencil let's see if we can't
make it work as our little no don't
touch my face hmm that looks ugly gonna
take a little brush like this a little
tiny pencil brush we're gonna wing
around just blend that in with the lash
line just blend her in yeah okay we have
some wings on actually I see this
beautiful you're dissin glittering
flakes this is also calling my name now
guys now we're just around
we're take a little bit of this adhesive
 what kinda accuse of is this oh oh
my god I haven't never smelt something
this vile in my existence I take a
little bit of the he's on the back of
our hand a little very very very little
bit on the lid wow this smells like
actual rotted flesh and they're gonna
take the little iridescent flakes
yeah but little flakes are on some more
brown underneath tie the whole look
together you know if you really want it
to be cohesive you know we really want a
nice seamless blend and if you have some
fallout with the glitter it's okay cuz
you're still beautiful I don't have
mascara obviously this is does not have
mascara I mean do some black paint but
this tiny brush and will fake lower
lashes at least cuz I don't have my ski
around faking them till you make them
looks like all good it's all good
because we're gonna put lashes on we're
gonna take some big ones from
the dead dolly collection how about are
they really oh really Wow I'm
disappointed in myself man I'm really
disappointed because I thought I was
gonna kill it I just don't want
to go hein like I don't understand why
they're so shitty mm-hmm okay moving on
to the lip and when we done I think what
we need to do is over and create some
 pigment please
please don't stain my lips please we can
really blind let's do a nude found it's
like soft pink
this lash is the wonky slot I've ever
tried on and like literally doesn't want
to bend but I don't understand what's
wrong with the glass hey guys this is
I'm getting who's gonna get the last
okay guys and there we have it we have a
full face using only Halloween store
makeup and it looks like we only used
Halloween store makeup usually I'm very
very very adamant about trying to make
us look you know very Chanel a very Tom
Ford a very high-end even we don't have
high-end products to use this case I
flopped so this is actually really
really hard a lot harder than I thought
was gonna be I think the only part that
I did like someone okay in was the base
the lip isn't like terrible terrible but
 it's rough it is rough eyes are the
worst the actual worst so I would
definitely challenge you guys to do this
kind of thing I think it's really really
fun it's really hard much harder than I
thought was going to be I think if I had
powdered shadows I could have made this
work 100% I couldn't find any powder
shadow at the fugging theme I was all
pains it was all paints only so that was
like the hardware that's the part I kind
of flopped at all in the lashes to find
different lashes buck the whole thing
could have been a different story anyway
guys hope you guys had fun watching this
video I had so much fun creating it I
think it's really fun
I love October I think October is really
really a fun ask month and it's so
festive and creative and just such a fun
time I'm not the best at doing Halloween
makeup it's not really my forte I've
never really been very good at it I
usually have fun in experiment with me
get more so in like a couple years ago
when I was first starting out and I
would try to do more weird things but I
actually had like hours and hours and
hours of time on my hands I don't really
have as much time nowadays and I feel
like sometimes like if the work if the
look doesn't turn out I feel like it
took a waste of my time you know so I
have to like it out of that mindset and
really try to get back into doing more
just fun makeup just fun things just
practicing a little bit more and getting
better at the crafts that I am not
always the best at you know I try my
hardest but doesn't always work out that
way I'm self-taught of course I'm
learned from YouTube just like a lot of
my fellow peers are and the space I
learned from YouTube on how to do makeup
learn from drag queens I learned from
different beauty gurus and things like
that so that's kind of how I did my
makeup yeah this is hope you guys
enjoyed today's video guys as always
have a great rest of the night or day
wherever you guys are and I will catch
you guys in my next video bye guys hey
