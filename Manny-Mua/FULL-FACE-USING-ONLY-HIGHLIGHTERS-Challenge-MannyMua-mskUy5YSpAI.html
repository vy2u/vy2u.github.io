one again two this will face highlighter
video
so we get into this video now full face
highlighters I'm so excited and so ready
for this first things first I'm gonna
start with champagne pop liquid
illuminator let's do it on a flat kabuki
I'm so nervous
oh okay we're done
oh you're start pressing that in this is
a really pretty champagne highlighter
liquid highlighter and they're still not
John came up with wait Becca
so absolutely amazing huh guys so
chocolate again just buff it into the
skin get the ears - you got a highlight
the ears people are so crazy with these
highlighting videos they freakin contour
their ears don't join you
so now that we have the base on we're
looking golden and dewy the pores are
just vicious and this kind of lighting
so next I'm going to take the diamond
glow powder in the shade e double-take
by artist Couture is that it set into
the skin a little bit
so doesn't get all blotchy on me so just
get any big fluffy brush and a powder or
just to learn to write and then oh my
god oh okay cool just go right in over
everything this powder gives a pink
reflection oh my god I get my dirty
it's a little bit more we're gonna go
for real in shade like my hair pink this
is like the weirdest challenge ever I
think like it's just so weird like you
don't want to highlight all these areas
but you do do so I swear to you in
person
I'm shimmery to the gods I am beat I am
done I'm shimmering I swear to God but
ensure that this stays on and I'm gonna
put on some more extra stuff on top of
it is I'm gonna take a little bit the
touch of luminous skin mist just to
ensure that we have a stickier base on
this face and this is japanese allah
almighty's in a lot so let's go ahead
and start actually like contouring with
his face the base is done let's start
bronzing up the skin we're gonna take
the Becca chocolate ale palette the one
has blushed copper in it this one with
pro and chubby bomb and we're gonna
start contouring up the skin with a
little more a three brush taking blushed
copper I start contouring the skin with
this it's a much darker highlight oh you
see that oh it's working this is
the weird
nose and work still about the temples
just to add some color back to the skin
this is a good chin down here we got a
contour you know you feel me
so for blush I'm gonna take the Pat
McGrath pink highlighter to give me like
a pinky blush tone it is a highlighter
but it's pink so we're gonna have that
more below she get back to it we're
gonna go in just start blushing up the
skin and if it doesn't if you don't see
enough pink just keep adding to it
hey yes let's rig it big you can see the
freaking color right oh heli I did I
love this and now to highlight with
actual highlighters Geoffrey actually
just got this new sleek palette it's
another highlighting palette but it has
like solar and like blue in it super
cool badass palette this one look at
this listen Tim I like it
some like this silver shimmery shade and
put that as my highlight because i
swatched it and it was silver
it was straight-up like morphing up by
ten pack the bitch on are you kidding
this is a joke this is a joke holy
holy crap this really works this is
basically a white tie layer / silver so
if you want to be highlighted to the
moon's so where you wanna go putting on
the high plains on my face Cupid's bow
on the pimple or I just add more
dimension now I feel like I'm really
going okay so I think we're done with
the face but looking really glowy really
dewy just absolutely stunning actually
it's out a little hint a little hint of
ice cold because this is literally like
a white highlighter on top of it just to
add oh there's an extra star a celestial
spirit and if you want to blend in oh
you sure can you Sugarhill can so it's
gonna move on to the eyes now and start
going in with a crease color we're gonna
take the UH Nastasia glow kit in Sun
ditch we're gonna take the darkest shade
right here on the crease because it's
like a brownish bronze shade is
literally called bronze it's a nice
darker shimmery shade I'm not used to
putting shimmery shades into the crease
so that's gonna be different okay bring
it out bring it out I look so cool even
though it's shimmery and really I feel
like it's wrong I should it should not
be there like so now for the lid I'm
gonna go in with my man
anyway now it don't judge me it's on a
highlighter but the Luna shade is a very
very bright intense freakin color so I
know on the late I'm gonna want to put
that there
on a more p.m. for two to just packed
out on the Lin pack it on here obviously
like you really don't need to blend in
between steps now because I mean it's
all kind of bunched together when it's
all a highlight let's be honest and I'm
gonna take a little bit Artemis which is
like the lightest shade in the palette
right on top of that two guards on the
inner corner as well just keep blending
everything all the edges about make sure
everything's cute now for the lower lash
line I'm going to take the shade
insomnia which apartment pal has walked
and by the way my palate is back in
stock so if you guys are interested in
check the bench oh oh yeah that is sick
you like that really cold intense look
like I'm actually gonna put out a little
bit make like a mini wing with it right
over the lashline
take it all blend together I think I
want to do like a shimmery inner rim
waterline I just need to find one in
this room nope
so I found this little pencil inside
defeats room I get no kick I cold from
magnetic a shimmery pearl shade and the
waterline a mess we're gonna do time for
some lashes and mascara I'm gonna put on
some new bounce some Russian black
lashes I'll be back so I'll have the
lashes on the eyes are completely done
this is what they look like I think they
look freaking snatched and highlighted
is sick now I'm going with my lip color
and I'm gonna be using one of the
Jeffries new lip time you nishan
lipsticks he has it like how you're a
Mike let me snag it up because I don't
even know what it's gonna be called but
I just know the packaging is sick and I
want to use it take a bright hot pink so
I'm honestly you use any color you want
to do I wanna put glitter over it so it
really doesn't matter I just wanted to
use it cuz it's here someone for that
alright now look at that pigment are you
kidding okay cool let's do that whole
lip so it's like orange soda
amazing so the lips are on it now I'm
gonna take a little bit of Mac reflex
Pro like my favorite reflex that Mac has
ever done it's so beautiful without all
over the lips on top of this I'm taking
a more PM 421 it just like a nice flat
packing brush I'm going to take the
reflex clear and put that all over the
lid let the brush something my finger
now that I have the reflux Pro out I can
put a little bow on my cheekbones just
to add a little extra I just feel like
I'm not highlighted enough or should I
live a bit on the cheekbones just to
give me a little extra something
something
mm-hmm there's at the top point no no
I'm good
oh my god this is pretty cool actually
that on the highest points pocket
everywhere and I look at the entire face
