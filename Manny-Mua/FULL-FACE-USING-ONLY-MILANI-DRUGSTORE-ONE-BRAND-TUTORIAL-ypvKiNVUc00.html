I feel like I have a wild forest on my
head look at that I see Nikita over
there hey guys welcome back to my
channel so it's a video I'm actually so
excited to film it's because I have not
done a one brand tutorial and so
freaking long and I see this pretty
often nothing like me like ten so far
done and I started way back like years
ago maybe three years ago and now I'm
gonna do another one because I've done
one so long and I actually asked you
guys on Twitter if you guys wanted to
see me do a one branch tutorial that was
high-end or drugstore and you guys chose
drugstore I do you guys fucking what so
when I would actually bought a bunch of
Milani stuff so I literally have a whole
bag of Milan T Milania Milania I'm just
a Milan to you for the gayness of it all
you know
I thought would be really fun to do a
one bread tutorial using Milani products
I thought it'd be really fun I got new a
couple of new things from them recently
- I get these like I was really
intrigued by these hypnotic eyes like it
looks like almost like a Stila glitter
situations on like you know I have to
try that so so we're gonna do we're
gonna do a one brand tutorial using all
Milania I have not used so many of these
products and maybe have tried to make me
like three or four of them total so it'd
be really it's gonna be like a first
impressions for me I like doing the one
mandatory because I feel like it's a
really cool way from eating to try
trying a bunch of products from one
brand and seeing what are the things
from the Brenda I really like things I
don't like so much and vice versa so
that potato is going to be I'm gonna be
doing a full face using only Milani
drugstore one brand tutorial as always
you guys doing this video if you guys do
not like me please don't fucking watch
it you know the drill with that and I
say with a smile because I'm a happy
bitch and if you don't like me that's
too fucking bad what do you guys do you
like this video please go and click
subscribe to my channel if you're not
already and if you knew what's up a man
um you ain't welcome to my channel thank
you so much for being here I really
really appreciate it
go and click that like button right now
I'll pause for you I'll pause for you
basically what happened was I did a
little bit of logging for it to kind of
like went around I went to three
different stores and got as much as I
possibly could using Milani I went to
CVS first they had nothing of Milania I
was like great then I went to Target
they had a bunch of stuff we found an
entire wall of Milani here at tarjay so
thank you God because I was not trying
to go all of it lays in finding a game
okay what are we thinking what do we
think can get primer here we have some
powders then I went to Walgreens I made
a bunch of stuff to put some stuff but
as powder we can use it with the darkest
shade is bronzer they have no money here
but first things first we're gonna
trying the Milania Prime shield to face
primer this when I bought myself as well
I'm gonna to seal thank you Jesus so
this is like one of those like silky
this looks exactly I guess Smashbox like
those like that Smashbox primer that's
like really really great a being like
silicone and silky feels like silicone
oh it feels me it feels great
oh my gosh it is small so overdue wait
I'm a little gag it's one of those
things worth that it feels awesome it
feels like silk on my skin but will this
make my foundation slide off and slip
and slide this is a prime Michelle this
is great for mattifying and poor
smoothing now I'm gonna go and grab the
foundation I grabbed the shade zero zero
light natural they do not have the best
range when it comes was that pumped
uh-huh it was pumped look something out
I bought two we have zero zero light
natural we have zero zero light okay so
I grabbed these two shades I'm gonna use
it fuckin I really don't care that much
am I getting infection or anything
hopefully well these two shades are here
honestly I feel like they have a really
not the best color arrangement when it
comes to their shades but it's gotten
better I feel like they didn't spend in
two shades because the one I used to use
was a shade natural and it was so bad
like I literally would oxidize orange
not on hat you can see look at its
oxidizing that shit's getting Orange I'm
gonna have to go with the lighter one
I'm gonna have to go with 0/0 be the
lightest I think this is no second to
lightest shade and the first one I think
applies with porcelain but
with orange Milani I'm really gonna need
just to step you're like shit up and
come out with more Kelly
okay this is the concealed and perfect
two and one foundation I can see like I
might do just before and I loved it
that is white mm-hmm
okay you know what it's fine I don't
think it's an end up being my shade
regardless address why are they advance
you know as I said accidental all the
time address what is she said she's
always tried to do but she can't roll
her hardest
that's why do it be something better
than her okay so we're gonna go in going
with this and let's pray to baby Jesus
in a manger it's really light but you
guys see my chest and my neck and the
whole thing it's I'm really light anyway
but I always try to go a little bit
deeper with my foundation because when I
take flash photography I photograph so
pale I don't know if you guys notice but
that's also why I never really matched
my foundation to my neck or like I
always look a little bit darker and you
guys are always like oh my god you never
met your face bitch because I photograph
too pale and I don't like how it looks
in photography or probably like a carpet
and I literally look like Casper when
I'm that pale and I don't go darker with
my foundation so I always go darker and
I like it I'm gonna like you I don't
like you loser guys so this is the
foundation right here it has a satin
dewy finish it'll dry down a little bit
more madness but it takes a minute
because they're really pretty coverage I
think that's actually really really nice
I really really like this one a lot
isn't my favorite drugstore foundation
no but it's definitely one of them I
would say it's definitely talk buy for
me
because I think the finish is really
pretty also the coverage is really
pretty updates like a medium to
buildable coverage it's not full we're
gonna go in with the retouch any race
shade number zero one Milani concealer
honestly you guys this foundation acts
as a concealer and it does cover quite
nicely but they have concealer so why
the fuck not time to get one so I'm
gonna grab this guy okay so it comes out
like a little poof it has a poof
as a poof it has a little spongy poof
I'm gonna go ahead and dot it how is
that literally darker than my foundation
is what I want to know
Oakley apply it with a little sponge
okay y'all this is not light enough I
think this is literally the lightest
shade that I grab like die saw in the
store and it's still not even light
what the hell okay so this guy is
definitely more about color correcting
concealer I don't definitely it's like
so yellow after the coverage this is
about medium nothing too crazy it's not
too too sheer which is nice I still can
cover up a good amount of stuff that's
definitely not a full coverage so this
is her this is the face right now I
think I'm too glowy
how does it look on the viewfinder to
you guys cuz to me it's not looking too
too great but it's not looking as
terrible either so this is the face with
a concealer on I don't know I just
didn't covered that okay guys so
concealer wise I just have a concealer
on the Civic right now I'm looking at
the viewfinder item to see what looks
like on camera and in person it gives me
like a barely a medium coverage like
barely it's definitely not something
that's gonna cover up all your darkness
and your bags or anything like that I'm
like it's okay but I wouldn't really
recommend it I honestly would have just
rather use the foundation as concealer
so that's actually what I'm gonna do
want to take that same shade and a
little bit more out and put that
underneath my eyes because honestly the
concealer itself is not really doing it
for me so if you were to pick between
one of the two just go with the
foundation instead okay well thank
goodness for the fucking foundation the
foundation is what's really keeping us
going right here keep it as a foot now
for setting powder you guys we have the
Milani prepping set go translucent face
powder and that's all I found at the
store when it came to setting powder we
really need to set this face because I'm
hard iam starting decreasing crumble
like honey please we're kidding here
it's a white translucent powder this is
gives me a nervous because for flash
photography girl but it's setting
honestly like the skin is looking better
with it on 100% like it definitely looks
so much prettier so much smoother with
this setting powder oh my gosh somehow
you're saving me and you're giving me
some life thank you how do you think you
know thank you okay so we have our face
set with the powder I think it look so
much better
shockingly I don't have any flashback
and then okay powdered you are winning
my affection so now we have bronzer so
we're gonna take the Milani baked
bronzer in the shade Dulce lose it
adultery is don't a what I say I swear
Mexican if you want actual really funny
is that you guys always asked me to do a
tutorial in Spanish but I can't speak
Spanish I can do like Spanglish bullshit
but I can't speak Spanish no no no no
we're gonna take Dolce
oh my god looks so orange but I'm not
into big bronzers so I'm nervous I'm not
gonna lie like okay it's a little bit
warm it's a little orange honestly that
was the closest shade that would be as
not as orange though I got the other
colors we're so orange II that I'm like
a girl like I can't but honestly on
camera it's not looking too bad and in
person it's not looking that bad either
really is it I think that definitely I
picked the best of the three options for
the big bronzers as this one and it is
looking really pretty it's definitely
more of a natural finish it's definitely
not like a full matte finish okay guys
so in case I didn't like this bronzer
because it's like the only bronze I had
found at the store I grabbed the
concealed and perfect shine proof powder
and the shade number five thinking I'm
like maybe this could be a bronzer just
to see I mean I honestly don't know what
this is gonna look like so we're just
gonna brush it over just give us a
little bit more of a color actually is
giving us color and it's getting us
coverage why not grab this powder
machine hmm that looks so much prettier
okay why am i living for this powdery
now hold on feels great looks like this
it's a little more it's more cool to
them which I actually like oh that looks
so much better I think what do we think
now you guys full face using molarity
when yes not so much a win didn't like
this now I wouldn't grab blush I grabbed
the Milani romantic Rose blush I think
that their press and this is so ungodly
beautiful like this is also mean Italy
which makes me feel rich Oh a pigmented
girl Harley
okay actually have to build up we're let
it be pigment in right away apples of
the cheeks and blending it backwards
that's so fucking pretty like it's like
a really pretty natural blush as like a
very subtle pinky undertone it's matte
but it's not like a dead matte where you
feel like you're gonna die this is like
a pretty satin matte finish I would say
it does give me some life Sunkist okay
the okay blush is a win I love it I also
really really just in general like
milania's blushes Luminoso is my go-to
blush from them but I don't want to use
excel you already use that so much oh we
got some burn in the bath clean
okay guys so now we have some
highlighters we have these new guys
these just came out I believe these are
the Sun glow luminous luminescent Soleil
their Sun glows afterglow strobe light
these are strobe light instant glow
powders I can i could not find that from
life of me so we have the shade number
three Sun glow we have the shade number
one as a swatch right here feels not so
great so that makes me a little shook
that's try the gold one gold feels the
same way doesn't swatch a very good
either
oh honey that is not good oh God okay
let's go and put on the face and we'll
see you know so maybe not judge a book
by its cover or its texture we're gonna
put this on the face we're gonna really
load up the brush you know I don't
anything that we can build it and get it
to they're like I don't think we can get
it to a cool look I really don't like
the texture of this formula whatsoever
but I think that we're definitely
getting somewhere and this and my layers
are like I'm really going in that we
built it up
that's buildable at least at least we're
buildable it looks nice on the nose
though
fuck it looks good on the nose okay so
we have as a highlighter um I think it's
not too bad I think that's nothing a
little bit too cool tone for my face cuz
you actually see I'm again to be
fighting right now you actually see like
where the disconnect is between the
blush and highlighter we're gonna do is
we're gonna write the book we're gonna
write the highlanders okay
honest yellow of one being like the
worst highlighter in the entire world
you ever tried think of the worst
Heather you ever tried is me number one
and number 10 being the best Heather
you've ever tried lunar beauties coming
out in the near future I was gonna be
your number 10 I'm just letting you know
this I would have to say is that like a
six because it's a little bit it's
better than a five you know we didn't
fail we didn't fail obviously but it
just doesn't look that guy either
okay now we're take some setting spray
and set the face this I fuckin love this
is they make it last setting spray this
I've used and this I love smells amazing
the mist is so fine like me and I love
it and it's super sticky like actually
like makes your makeup stay on so well
now the weight of the face on I'm
actually going to give this bad boy a be
the face is looking not too bad honestly
I love the second spray the highlighter
we got it there the blush I love the
bronzer the face powder was nice the
foundation was nice to concealer was
trash but honestly like for the most
part like I have to give this bad boy
like a good solid B she's not too bad
now I can move on to the specific we
have the Milani stay put brow color and
it comes with a little brush which I
love that the drug lords do this that
they give you a brush and they give you
the product with it I grabbed a shade of
dark brown this looks so warm I'm
probably gonna end up being shook
oh she's pigmented so pigmented I like
it on the hand but I like on that Brown
oh cool this this literally just fell
off by doing nothing oh this brush is
terrible
oh it's absolutely not so I'm going to
take it on a morphe brush actually the
color is not too bad
yay is actually acting like dip brow so
much of really kind of living it's not
as amoliant as dip brow hairs like it
doesn't like to move as easily and it's
a bigger consistency and it's more
viscous for short but for a drugstore
price point things is actually really
really nice those are the brows honestly
they're a little bit darker than I
usually go I've been actually going
really a lot
lighter with my brows I'll be using the
shade anastacio the dipbrow anastacio no
the Anasazi dip brow in the shade taupe
is what I've been using so these are
pretty dark for me right now anyway now
we're gonna go and use some eye primer
and I grabbed this is the eyeshadow
primer lightweight invisible finish I've
heard great great great things about
this I feel is really nice it feels very
like silky and it feels and reminds me a
lot of the Urban Decay all like that
like they're like primer potion almost
like I was like a silicone me feeling
consistency to it oh I just remembered
I didn't buy a mess is ammonia mascara
wait wait are you kidding me they have
some I did not know okay it's fine pull
it away that's fine eyeliner so first
we're gonna use these pellets I saw
three little of these guys in the store
this is the only one that actually had
somewhat of color with that orange like
literally that they were the most basic
on the go pallets which is fine because
that's just like what it is it was like
a basic on the glow palette but none of
them were fun or exciting in any way
shape or form at the store so I'm like
this is the most exciting when they had
I'm not kidding I'm no kini what is
happening and what is happening here
I wasn't expecting some of that
smoothness take this sheet right here
this warm brown go ahead and put that
into the crease with a morphe M 505
really pigmented you see that like
really thick we did that blended out
very nicely okay oh my gosh they pick up
on the brush Milani by the way this
brush is a morphe r38 just a really
fluffy brush okay so we have the shadow
blended into the crease looks pretty
nice also Milani came out with these
bitches which is like kind of sickening
they came out with these little what is
this hypnotic lights holographic eye
toppers house ton these are my me a
stealer I'm telling you so these guys
are actually toppers so I'm actually
because they look a little bit like
streaky just like how like although all
of them look streaky like from every
brand they look streaky
well I'm gonna do is I'm gonna going to
apply a little bit of and
shadow from that little palette and then
I'm gonna go on top of it with the
topper we're gonna take that little
maroon shade and we're gonna put onto
the lid their finger this is a really
pretty it's like a pretty easy like
dainty look okay so now that we have
that down so we have the base down I'm
gonna go in go in with this topper oh my
a little bit goes a very long way so you
actually don't need that much product
these are a win for me I'm sorry these
are a freaking win for me honey they're
so pretty and like just so easy to use
look at that you guys we're gonna look
like a million bucks by the end of this
I'm telling you
let's do recap what I think about these
I think these are fucking you're a
holographic toppers are awesome and this
guy I would say these four are really
cool like these are great chains these
two not so much these four are great so
I'll give this guy a b-minus okay guys
so now what we're gonna do we're gonna
go ahead and go on in with some eyeliner
and I grabbed this Mac I'll and these
are the the black matte stay put matte
Milani out here I love when there's a
little ball I always try to shake him
just make sure there's the ball okay now
we're gonna go in with this eyeliner
because the tops of my eyes are dry we
have like a felt tip applicator if you
guys know anything about me I hate felt
tip so much I'll throw a pigmentation
right there well it's a fat wing I can't
I literally am unable to do wings with
this kind of applicator it makes me feel
so shitty about myself I'm like I can't
do makeup I'm Carol me for this okay but
honestly why am I actually living for
the eyeliner formula it's so black so
Matt I feel so lightweight it doesn't
feel like heavy like super drying I'm
going to the other eye for the camera
and I'm gonna apply some mascara and
lashes off-camera only because I did not
buy mascara the ice still looks snatched
I also used this highlighter for the
inner corner and the brow bone but we
grabbed a couple of lip products we have
the amore matte lip creams
a lipstick I'm thinking the morning
matte lips or what we want to go with
they swatch so nicely honey of course I
grab some nude ones and then I got a
metallic one and they smell like cake
batter they smell so good should I do
them and talaq one no I can't do it I
can do it nope
I think I tried these if you guys are
watching this video you guys I have
tried so many things let me know what
you guys thought about them I'm really
curious this color is so pretty shade 10
adorable this is the lip cream it's
starting to dry down now I can feel it
definitely drying it feels super super
nice you guys like I'm really honestly
kind of living the dry down nicely
doesn't feel too drying it's a little
tacky still I think that's great for
when it comes to like not being overly
drying has a little bit of tackiness so
I'm gonna do it actually I'm going to
apply shade 60 innocence on top in the
center to see how it reacts to this
whole edge to lighten it up a bit that's
her I just try the lip topper on top
just in case okay guys so that is it for
today's video we are done doing a full
face using only Milani
products what do we think what did I
sing with the Corita what do we think of
the face so honestly guys as a whole I'm
gonna give this a positive b-plus for
the whole look I think that collectively
I think we definitely got it there I
think it looks so pretty I think that
it's definitely not only because I feel
like I'm a little bit of a harsh critic
like a czar giving out to like the best
of the class you know I'm thinking a B+
is more like you're almost there I
really like how this turned out I think
it's so so so pretty and hope you guys
enjoy it as well though the hard winners
of this look today have been this this
is a win the lip creams again another
hard win that was so sickening the blush
was the win there are some really really
really positive notes on this the ones
that were not so much of a win were the
highlighters to me not that great the
pie was okay and not that great another
win was this is this another win was
this guy right here as a whole honestly
Milani is a great brand
really really really impressed with some
of these things and I'm really really
really liking how a lot of it looks so
far on that face anyways you guys that's
it for today's video hope you guys had
fun watching it I had so much I'm
telling for you guys I'm not done with
one brand video and so long let me know
in the comments below if you guys want
to see me do another one brand video and
what brand you guys would like to see
whether struck store high-end middle and
anything you guys want to see I can
definitely definitely make that happen
for you guys cuz there's honestly so
much fun and I love it all it's someone
to do just to kind of see the good
things and the shitty things most of
these things honestly were really great
though and I'm really really pleasantly
surprised anyways you guys have a great
show tonight or to where you guys are
