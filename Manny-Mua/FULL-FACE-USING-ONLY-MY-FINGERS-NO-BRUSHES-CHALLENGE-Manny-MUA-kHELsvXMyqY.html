so excited for today's video because I'm
gonna be doing the full face using only
my fingers challenge I know this was
like a really popular thing a couple
years back then it kind of came back
recently everyone started doing it again
so I'm like you know what I really want
to try doing this it just looks like
such a fun tag and it definitely looks
like a challenge which is like what I
wanted to do I'm like you know let's go
and challenge ourselves today and let's
go ahead and make this video I'm not
gonna be using any brushes in this video
obviously also I don't have acrylic
nails I only just have like my fingers I
don't have nails I've seen a lot of
people do this with having acrylic nails
I don't have any code nails I just have
chubby little fat man hands I
feel like the nails are kind of like a
helping tool so I'm like you know what
I'm gonna try it without the nails no
nails no tools just little nubs and
honestly I think it's such an out pretty
bad but I'm praying for the best that's
all you can ask for me you know I'm
gonna try my hardest I'm gonna try
really hard and that's all you can ask
for me okay cool so Italian start
getting into this video as always you
guys like this video if you guys don't
like me please on watch it you
know I do yeah but you guys do like this
video go ahead and subscribe to my
channel
man anyway welcome how are you and yeah
so I get into this full face you see
only our fingers challenge
okay let's start this I've
seen a lot of people's videos I've seen
a lot of people's videos on this it's
like almost like a I think I'm studying
for like a Reis obviously is not a
competition but I gotta go like I want
to do good you know um so first things
first I'm going to prime my skin using
the Porefessional by benefit and that I
have done on my fingers so I'm not
really scared about doing now so what I
decide to do I'm gonna prime my skin
first and imma start on the brows I feel
like the brows it's gonna be like that
one of the hardest parts of this video
so I'm gonna do the brows first and then
I'll do the rest of my face and like my
eyes and like that but I want to
have my face primed because I'm kind of
messy boy just like that okay cool so
let's go and start on with the brows now
I figured I also need like pinky for the
brows because my pinky is the smallest
finger I have and even though it's
 largest like that like are
you kidding I can cover the whole
 brow with this bitch it's huge
but we're gonna try to use it I'm gonna
use the new make it forever
brow sculpting brow palette that's like
a little powder and I quacks and stuff
like that so I'm gonna use that because
I feel like you're using brow powder
it's gonna be easier to erase it with
concealer so I'm gonna take the low
darkest color in my pinky oh this feels
wrong oh this feels buggin wrong I'm
sorry pushing that through the brow with
my pinky this is weird this is a
really messy thing oh yeah this is tough
just when you have chubby ass
man hands like me so that'll be my brows
filled in this contest filled it I don't
know what the I'm doing in my life
I'm gonna take the Mac Pro Longwear
little concealer a little dollop of that
on my hand
and I'm gonna use this to like underline
my brow and clean up everything and
let's just write plugins
it's a lot tougher than that
oh yeah this is a lot tougher life
throws at me okay miss use my pinky
again filly do that
mm-hmm on a scale of one to ten how bad
does that look like really bad or like
kinda bad hmm fine it's fine
make it work times like this make me
wish I never bit my nails mm-hmm it's
going to blend down that concealer you
know eyebrows at arias they do they
look thick as hell but it's not
as bad as I thought I was gonna be and
some we're gonna continue all the lamps
we can do this we can do this
 okay I feel like I look angry okay
it said again
Debra has seen better days those brows
have seen better days
Wow one takes an auto Saskia brow gel
put it on our hand I'm gonna go over it
with our fingers and king and painted
there you you want that extra thick brow
look going with eyebrow gel but if you
want the bitches to take you
serious go in with brow gel I've never
had thicker brows in this it's almost
offensive but we're gonna be fine
okay I said about like 15 almost 20
minutes on my brows
okay I can't I'm obsessing and it's
ridiculous and honestly honestly the
right brow is not that bad well left
brow looks like me even got in a fight
we're not talking I can't continue to
upset it's fine it's done that's it the
brows but it's fine okay something my
Smashbox 24-hour primer and I'm take
that on the lids of the eyes with my
finger because that I know how to do hmm
that I can do okay we're set up that all
the way over there's so much concealer
over up on this brow move child don't
look fishy and pretty or doesn't put a
 Indian okay cool so I think now
that my eyes are primed I'm gonna go
ahead and start on with the face I know
I'm not kind of jumping all over the
place but I just rhymed I just feel like
you Narayan so I'm gonna go ahead jump
to the face now and do my base and then
I'll continue on with the eyes after I'd
want to have the brows done prime my
eyelids and everything for what's to
come
sorry first things first we're gonna
take the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD stick
this is a tallest reading this was
 dreading
just don't think about it don't think
about it it's fine I've got chills
either got chills down like this
okay it's fine when I press it on them
to our skin we're just gonna do patting
motions and we're just gonna pretend
this is a Beautyblender so we're gonna
pretend okay cuz I have to grow
freak application with your fingers with
foundation not so bad with this
challenge I feel like when you add more
coverage it was just a better
when there's more coverage so what we're
gonna do is we're gonna keep on pushing
keep on padding play a little prep for
me on your ears - you know this looks
really bad over my beard the reason that
I can kind of get away with putting
foundation on my beard is with a Beauty
Blender because it's not that bad you
better for some reason just helps it not
catch on here but with your fingers my
beer is not happy okay down our nose
we're gonna tap for optimal coverage
that sounds so weird hitting your nose
what do you think I like this sounds
like it sounds like an appropriate
things that I hate how this feels I hate
it I hate it me me me honestly the right
brow is kind of slaying it you know
foundation is on feeling cakey is that
or so now let's go ahead and put on some
concealer I'm going to take my tart
shape tape concealer in the shade light
put a dollop on my hand child why are we
doing this again why are we doing this I
don't them okay not so bad I
hate the way it feels don't like
touching this but it doesn't it's not
that bad
you guys I'm really trying to slay this
for real I'm not gonna be a
basic bitch I'm gonna slay it for you
I'm gonna leave it for me okay now for
the powder I don't want this is the
part I was also dry laura mercier
I set the eyes this finger not the
singer that we were putting it on the
graph it with this one look up oh
okay
this is so wrong muga wrong everything I
meant eyes a lie okay we're going to Pat
it in we're gonna make sure we Pat
everything in and make sure we can avoid
creasing the problem with this is that
you put it down with the powder
and then lifts up because it's a finger
and we're patchi's don't forget to
bake your smile lines mmm okay now for
real like what the do I do what I
do like how do i okay so we just put
some on her hand make me like this I put
some on our hand
I'm gonna do yeah just oh why'd I
even knew that I was stupid I'm gonna
press it in why am I doing this why am I
 doing this for reals
so we're gonna do not so we're gonna do
we're gonna put it on our hand between
our fingers now we're gonna do that or
we're gonna do that and the more I hate
my face I've noticed the more the excess
powder falls off this is I'm like
actually hurting myself come down on our
nose now you guys should see my station
right now it's so messy it's
like distracting wasting one more CA
this clutter isn't cheap no not the
brows I should have done the powder
part before I did the brows huh oh my
gosh okay what we didn't think about is
how do I take off the excess powder on
face maybe after it's finished cooking I
can like dust it off with my fingers
yeah that's right
no come on okay so this is about as much
powder I can get off so we're looking a
little patchy but we're gonna do then I
want to do is I'm gonna grab the
airbrush flawless finish powder by
Charlotte Tilbury
and fix up the spots that are a little
bit patchy and a little like that came
up from putting on the powder nice a
number two and it's just gonna help make
things look hopefully a little bit more
a little prettier Ryan just areas like
the areas are my nose that did not like
like me basically is what I'm doing here
so I figured a for bronzer blush and
highlighter we're gonna use some color
pop ones because these have like an
emollient a weird consistency and I
figured that would be really good for
this kind of challenge so for bronzer
I'm gonna take the shade skinny dip the
super shock cheek in the shade skinny
dip Matt use our fingers I've never even
tried to tell my faces was actually the
first time ever they feel exactly like
the matte shadows like
it feels exactly the same we're going to
bronze up the skin hmm
I thought use e to create like a sharper
contour this kind of thing because using
a finger and I think there's a little
bit more precise than a brush would be
able to think that's not that bad that's
not that bad that looks like a
severe ass contour and I'm kind of
living okay other side I should really
try using these a little bit more
because not so bad I'm kind of intrigued
up okay go ahead and bronze up your
forehead and your temples wherever the
 you want a bronze bronze it up with
your finger and skinny-dip oh this is
really weird
okay we're it's fine it's fine we are
going to live we're going to get through
this and we're going to be glamorous
 I think using tapping motions is
gonna be a little easier when doing the
bronzer just keep the color and coverage
there but still being able to blend it
out with the tapping motions do some on
the chin too I could normally do how's
that look it's a little blotchy so right
now I just try to go like this with the
tantalizer bronzer and try to intensify
the bronzer that is salvia okay let's
try to blend that out it's not that bad
it's not that bad it's really not -
other side to either just got a little
bit my finger like this you do a little
bit on the forehead as well it's so warm
I've never tried this already no such a
warm shade so now we're going to highly
I'm gonna take the shade spoon super
shock cheek from again gonna pop and I'm
gonna put that on the highest point - ji
yi you want me now ally with them a
little you me is doing this step before
I looks at everything so this is odd
we're at a time we're gonna blend blend
your fingers bleed okay God
and then for blush we're gonna take the
same thing I'm sure you guys we're
assuming color pop shade between the
sheets for the blush it's like a really
really pretty peachy pink shade well
this one's a little harder this is older
huh okay
okay we're gonna tap first and see how
crazy it is tap between the highlight
and the bronzer / contour that's a
really pretty color actually a really
ready color and to top off the face
highlight I'm gonna go ahead and head
there's you a taupe
as highlighter you guys know I love to
Trin but I don't know nothing stuck
right now something these topaz on your
nose topaz is in stock right at the tip
point just to be extra extra goddess T
is still abound the nose to to snatch it
slightly because I don't know if I
really want to contour it keep whoa whoa
okay guys so the face is on now this is
the face so it looks like I don't think
it's too bad it could be a lot lot worse
so now I'm gonna go and do the eyes and
let's get started on this
first things first I'm gonna take the
infallible shadow by L'Oreal and the
shade endless Pro which is that aim at a
cream color I figured we're gonna put
that all over the entire eye space to
have a nice base and to have things to
like transition into over the eye to set
everything set the concealer we had on
earlier just so I have a nice base color
down to the creamy white looks a little
funny okay cool so we have this base on
 I don't know what I'm doing I don't
know what I'm doing
I'm an artist I'm creative and I can
 do this
okay so makeup geek just came out with
some shadows some brand new shadows and
I've already potted them and put them
into my little deep edit so much how do
you some of these sheets good either
through hmm I'm gonna take this shade
bake sale which is a nice neutral
transition which almost has like a
little bit of a pinky undertone that's
like a pinkish Brown and it just looks
really stunning and that's like right up
my alley so I'm gonna take that
on middle finger a little a very light
amount I'm just gonna wear it even pray
for the best
what was that into the transition oh
holy and realize that it goes on to
die okay we're gonna Pat and blend I
decide that I'm gonna do any halo I for
sure okay put that on the outer corner
don't hit on the inner corner of my eye
as well this is so much harder than I
thought was in being holy a
thousand be like a nice light neutral
nothing crazy
okay when I start putting this into the
crease that's our pinky how do people do
is my nose in the way I'm
feeling like okay we're gonna
and to blend out the crease part above
we're going to go and just press and Pat
um to help blend out the color and look
we can always go back in with that
L'Oreal white shade to really help clean
up everything so she looks something
like uh huh do the no brushes challenge
they said it'll be fun they said Ben
goodness for makeup geek shadows because
they blend so well even on the
finger okay so we have the base of the
halo down not as what do they like to go
but uh grabs we're going to keep moving
so I'm gonna take these shade
cabin-fever by making geek another one
of their new shades I believe don't
quote me on my pinky let down the pinky
I'll take it on the outer corner start
dividing the halo into the crease little
closer than the other shade don't do
that same thing on inner third blend it
out feel like we're getting somewhere
here I'm getting somewhere right it's
like terrible terrible it's like it's
bad but it's not like like you don't
want like crying so now I'm gonna go in
with the shade from colour-pop weeny
which is I believe part of Kathleen's
collection with color pop one of her
whatever collections this is the shape
we nice oh it's a really cool like
foiled like rose color now to put that
on that middle part of our halo I can
see your halo mm that's beautiful that's
actually stunning cool cool cool blend
out those edges with bakesale real quick
and then on top of that I'm gonna go
ahead and put the new shade from makeup
geek called
encore or I don't know that Sofia shade
I just have it in this little palette
I'm gonna put that on top of Kathleen's
color just give us an extra bit of pop
on the center of the lid this is so
pretty actually I wish I did this with a
brush okay so this is what the top of
that eye looks like go ahead and try to
blend out those edges a little bit more
let's go ahead and run that same shade
bakesale underneath our lash line just
to give us some I don't even know at
this point I'm just feeling a little
unlike a lot of puffy right now sorry
guys it's hard for me to talk because
I'm trying to concentrate and I don't
want to fail you and I
feel like I'm failing this yelling so
now we're gonna take a little bit of
that same chocolatey shade which was
cabin fever a very tiny like a little
tiny little nugget see that nugget yeah
that little nugget I'm gonna put it on
the outer corner can't even see it can't
even see it okay well you can't you
can't a little bit yeah you guys here
okay moving in si muy bien
okay yeah unless you think that's gonna
keep it yeah I'm gonna put some lashes
on how about mascara okay so top a
mascara and I was thinking oh it's fine
like the mascara be easy I can just do
it with the thing and I can't because
it's all fingers so I'm just take some
of the mascara product roller lash
specifically my benefit because then
Devi
on the back of my hand I don't know
I don't know what I'm gonna do black on
my hand finger luckily I wear lashes all
the time so it's like not that bad is a
terrible idea got to do the bottom
lashes too this is tough
the bottom lashes am you like want to
see what hell on earth maybe nothing's
happening I've come to realize that the
wiggling helps a little bit better
Hey time for lashes okay the mascara is
on now we're put on some lashes that are
bigger than what life our hopes our
dreams we're gonna take Bella lashes
from a New Balance somewhere and put
these on and this is gonna really help
conceal all the mistakes you made in
your life uh-huh you guys were so
mistaken if you guys styles and be doing
eyeliner with this look because I have
nubs yeah
how'd the fingers I'm a shrew it's funny
because I hate putting on lashes with my
fingers I always use um tweezers so this
is even a challenge for me I don't like
it BAM okay so now they have lashes I'm
going to go and do the lips and we are
done with the full fix using all hot
fingers so I'm gonna take the Rimmel
London lipstick in the shade 45 I just
love this color so much I use it all the
time as you can see I'm just going to
take that on my finger of course
this feels weird and no lip lining
either okay
why don't we just kill man yet what
we're at it
oh this is Ditka while doing a bottom
lip not too hard not too hard
how does one over draw when there is no
lip liner and to top it all off we're
gonna add some Glaus from Marc Jacobs
this is in the shade moonchild I might
put that all over the lips to make it
look like we care about ourselves this
is it oh my god we finished it you guys
we did the full face using only fingers
challenge and yes this was a
challenge
it was hard and my nose looks
massive because I didn't contour it
because I was scared
no I want I don't want to ruin it that's
why I wanna ruin my face cuz I feel like
looks okay five and I feel like at my
contour my nose all right trying it so

let's put more highlight on and that is
it you guys that is it for the entire
look this is the full face using only my
fingers challenge and honestly I don't
think it turned out that bad I thought I
could have done a lot worse um
especially with using only my little
nubs
you know only my nubbies I only use my
fingers in this and I honestly thought
it turned out pretty good I'm contoured
I'm highlighted I haven't I looked on
that's let's you know a little risky a
little cool but we got through it and
you know lips are done not over draw
like I like to but we did it yeah I had
so much eye creme this video for you
guys if you guys liked it go ahead and
give it a thumbs up
I would really appreciate it I would
definitely suggest you guys doing this

hard and I would say the hardest part
