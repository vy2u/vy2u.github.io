so today's video I am so excited I'm
going to be doing a full face using only
my mom's makeup she is a glam girl she
has a lot of makeup she wears makeup
every single day and I told him like mom
when you're coming over because she's
also my executive assistant because she
helps me with my life and stuff I'm like
just leave your makeup bag here one
night so I can use what you use and just
do a full face using her stuff I doubt
that this is the bag that she used it I
think is usually all in her purse so she
like just kind of threw it back together
probably not her like everyday bag bag
but she gave it to me in a little bag so
I appreciate that mom not giving me a
little purse but I really wanted to try
it out this video because she is a glam
person she loved to wear makeup and I
give her a lot of my PR here and there I
just don't know what to expect which is
why I'm so excited I have no idea what
kind of makeup that she uses every
single day because she comes over she's
already beat and I'm like mom you're
coming to my fucking house you don't
need to do a full face of makeup
she's like you actually have no idea who
started this trend cuz a trend a couple
months ago so I have no idea who
actually started the trend if you guys

okay cool let's go and get into this
full face using my mommy's makeup
I'm so nervous
having opened the edges right now this
is filled to the actual brand mom are
you serious you use this much makeup in
a day I know I'm gonna find a lot of it
in here because it is literally my mom's
favorite brand ever ever since like it
was on QVC I'm sure it is so funky BC my
mom is consumed with a cosmetic school
this is cute I see that she does use
this quite a bit this is the urban decay
back it's a quick on-the-go moment oh my
gosh okay sorry I'm like overwhelmed
more it okay more kit we have okay we
have more it I knew I just wagging knew
it in my bones I don't see a primer in
here anywhere I'm not gonna use her
brushes because that's a little sick
that's sick I can't do it like I just
came back dr. Brandt pores no more mom
I'm proud of you I am so proud of you
actually love the dr. Brandt pores no
more so this is actually a big win I
just swear she doesn't have concealer in
here I'm gonna scream I used to be
obsessed with this primer back in the
day I literally gone through I think -
there's so much makeup you fall out of
love for things you fall in love with
other things it is what it is but dr.
Brent primer is so nice it doesn't clog
my pores in any way shape or form but it
does keep my pores looking nice and
fresh and snatched we're gonna go in and
take she uses the shade light/medium and
medium
bye-bye foundation full coverage
moisturizer a full covered moisturizer I
don't know if I've ever even used this
this is the CC cream and this is the
bye-bye foundation she has both of these
I guess she likes your option let's go
and just try the bye-bye foundation
first and we'll see what it is she loves
this shit I know she loves they close it
two pumps how is it that my mom's shade
matches me better than my own by the way
I'm taking it on a morphe beauty sponge
this is my favorite beauty sponge of all
time you guys already know this I use it
literally all the time I have like ten
on reserve oh its oxidizing
you can use my code man um you am morphe
also if you guys did not know you can
use my code in stores as well a lot
people are like oh my god you can use
your code in the store what the fuck I
had no idea you can totally say Haney's
many anyways code in the store it's a
man EMU a and they'll be really cool and
they'll give you a 10% discount yeah I
know it's fucking cold I don't know I
just feel like it doesn't give me enough
coverage fuck my mom's also not full
coverage kind of girl let's go and take
a little bit of mix of the CC cream as
well because I felt this easy cream has
a little bit
coverage - yeah I think the CC cream has
a more coverage than the foundation does
it already looks like it's covering a
lot more awesome taking on a brush this
is the morphe m4 39 the CCP was actually
really nice it cosmetics are really
cornered the market on mummies they did
that okay bitch they did that
I feel like moms love it because it
fused with skincare and like moms like
wanna not have wrinkles you know I'm
saying if y'all ever wanna sponsor me
hit a bitch hahahaha individualizing a
little bit now but the coverage is
definitely there yes I look so natural
and glowy still gives me some good
amount of coverage I feel like I look a
little bit more tan which I never never
mad at I'm just not used to this this is
not like the kind of foundation they use
like every day or anything like that
this is definitely more like a
lightweight natural kind of girl for me
but you guys are watching like oh my god
it cosmetics CC creams like my full
coverage and I'm like no I know it can
definitely get to full coverage but it's
just like the feeling on the skin feels
like a moisturizer it feels like a wet
it's like a wet feeling you know so we
look natural and luminous and dewy now
moving on to concealer please have one
mom you're lying
this is not what she uses as concealer
perfect lighting radiant touch magic
wand corrects conceals and brightens by
it cosmetics what do we know please tell
me it'll cover something what color is
it oh it's it's pink
that one came real left-field for me
sweetie will this even do anything dude
she is it cosmetics fanatic I swear
there's no other products that are not
it in here I'm gonna scream at her I'm
going to scream at her I'm looking for
powder so we have the a Cosmetics
translucent powder I only have the laura
mercier brightening powder which are
both I'm a museum to that good job mom
it's gonna get the job done like it's
definitely brightening it has that pink
undertone so it's definitely definitely
brightening put it so on the natural
side but this definitely doesn't give me
like the coverage that I usually go for
underneath my eye and usually I'd be
like no no I can you just as my base I
don't go in with a concealer after but
this is not what my mother does I gotta
listen to her on this one I haven't
listened to her in seven years I'm just
kidding we're gonna take a little bit
more of that bye-bye foundation to hide
the fact that I'm literally as pink as a
fucking flamingo and I'm wearing a pink
shirt that doesn't help I really wanted
to do me dirty huh she wanted a fucking
do me fucking dirty in this fucking
bitch huh now we're going to take it be
laura mercier brightening powder
underneath the eyes and set these ojitos
before they crease and crack because I
know they will I don't think my face
I was born this powder you gotta be
careful with because it does give you a
little bit of flash back so you want to
take a little bit a very very very tiny
amount of it don't go overboard
this is on a morphe m4 3/8 and we're
gonna take the it cosmetics bye bye
under-eye or fly by pour powder I don't
know what to say you know how to speak
that's gonna go all over the rest of the
face trunk this is gonna really help us
powders alway just give me that little
extra oomph of life you know I mean like
I feel like it really just helps a lot
parent makes look tan
this week in color she is as light as me
girl what my own doesn't have a
highlighter I never seen a bug inhaling
okay luckily she has this backtalk
palette which we could use his blush and
we can use it for a highlighter but I
don't see a single fucking bronzer in
here oh she has a real concealer in here
I did fires I'm taking a little pause
right now a little contemplating life
mistakes I've made in the past I flopped
on stage her look into the back before
that's right oh I'm sorry I know I
already said but I'm fucking pissed at
myself right now so I'm just gonna go
ahead and put our glass over this face
bitch oh I'm so annoyed with myself
right now I could literally use the
green mom use Magne all right guys you
couldn't tell me how we're gonna say
that it was our primer yeah that's what
it was
I'm coming to life the coverage is
giving me life I'm so gagged right now
like y'all don't understand basically
just say our primer and you know we
pulled like a jockey I know she's a
powder early so we're pulling it yeah
yeah take a little bit of concealer too
because I'm already breaking all the
rules i jus want to see what color it is
I just need a little bit more coverage
oh my god is I was literally thinking my
mom flopped and she only used CC cream
always I'm like wow I'm like I really am
like proud of you
but what the fuck and full coverage ass
bye bye under-eye from it and she has
hourglass I had no faith in her and
Shane just restored it so since my face
is still wet might as well take a little
bit that bronzing just like multiple
type stick from Mac a little bit of love
with my beauty sponge it's actually a
pretty nice fucking color mom that's not
too bad blends up pretty effortlessly
actually you know my mom is technically
the original glam girl in my life when
she would get ready before I would like
go to school or like before she would go
to work I would go into her room and
watch her do her makeup and be so
entranced and I would literally just sit
there and watch her captivated okay I'm
going crazy now
I mean calm down I never contour with
I don't know why all this and I thought
I was gonna be brave and pull this
bullshit is bold was a bad idea that
nose is so snatched holy fuck
that's that's good very good I just
don't do that very often so I'm not that
good at it the cream contouring if I
practice more could I get ugly so we're
gonna go ahead and set our face now
taking that same CC powder you know we
gotta set this face so we're gonna take
that with the sponge and we're gonna put
that all over why is my mouth as I seen
some things fuck
okay guys so this is the face with the
base that took us a little while to get
there but we got there let's take some
blush and my mom has this cool ass
backtalk palette from Miss urban decay
which is cool because it has a lot of
shit and I think this is the only shot
that she actually provided me so that's
really sweet of her we're gonna go and
take it to shade and double tape which
is like a blush shade I'm gonna take
that on a morphe for or without in the
blush areas because all the bronzer we
got is that little piece of shit bronzer
that was cream and yeah i said it we
gotta have some life to our skin i my
mom does like to go heavy with the blush
she's like one of those moms that like
has blush you're like okay how's your
blush I mean how's it how's your kids I
just give me mom she's gonna punch me
I'm literally taking the blush into my
temples cuz I feel so weird with not
having anything like nothing this is
called draping I'm currently draping
right now so now we're taking shade
party foul and that same backtalk
palette this is a highlighter in here
which is great my mom did not fail me on
the highlights it's like a pinky
champagne highlighter I know my mom
likes it cause it's such a great on the
go thing cuz I was like your face
stuffin has your eye stuff in it and the
highlighter is not bad that's something
not bad that's not great either it's not
like blinding highlight by any means
we're just building we're just gonna
build it up we're gonna build it on out
till we get there
so sometimes you just gotta go on your
finger and really just take control
okay so we're totally busy the
complexion exam see any other complexion
products in here and she doesn't have
any bronzer just has the blush and the
highlighter I think we got to a good
point I think I look really I look
different but I like it I'm getting it
there you don't saying like I'm getting
it there this is the Dior show brows
Tyler mom you used your where the fuck
you're getting the fucking doors what I
need to know obviously his entire room
without asking camera fucking shut off
and I was starting the brow we're taking
this tiny little tube or her pencil and
it's actually
so cute because you can look like this
and this is a tiniest little brow
strokes and my mom is not into the brow
like that I'd do my brow she's into a
brow let's like to feather feather
feather feather like she's into a
feather brow so I'm just gonna fill in
the spots that I'm missing here
basically that's very much like my mom
nothing that she's missing here so I'm
just gonna kind of fill in I'll
definitely do more my path and not okay
just light strokes starting filling in
pretty nice but that looks pretty good
it's like cleaned up filled in but not
like my normal cut a bitch brow which I
live of course
okay I'm gonna do the other brow cover
and I'll be right back okay so we have
the brows on this is not how I do I also
use that it cosmetics brow gel to go
through them this is definitely more
like a sparse light brow for me I'm just
not used to it it's not the broad it is
what it is I think it actually looks
pretty good I think it's a cool natural
way of doing a brow so now I move on to
the eyes and I primed my eyes off of
camera but I need to talk about this
because I'm so proud of her family's in
her bag my mom has very very very greasy
oily lids and I told you I'm like mom
you need to try the Smashbox 24-hour eye
primer and look how much has it been
used literally half of it this she uses
this like every day if you guys are oily
on your lids and if you guys like notice
that your eye like shadow doesn't stay a
long time on your eyes or things like
that have you crease a lot try the
Smashbox 24 hour it is so fucking
incredible for longevity and my mom uses
it all the time I can see that I'm so
proud of her she does have some Stila
shimmer and glows in here which I'm
still proud of her she has some dose of
colors eyeliners so does she live some
Sheila shimmering glows which I'm so
proud of because they're just like easy
and chill and fucking awesome but all we
really have for shadow wise is this
palette which is actually adorable like
there's actually a good amount of colors
in here it's definitely not bad in any
way shape or form which I'm really
stoked I was like hey like bring your
makeup bag and I'm like do haven't I
start piling there she's like no not
really and I was like the fuck you me no
not really
this is basically her equivalent of
makeup so we're gonna take the shade
backtalk and what the fuck took a
brownie transition you can't really do
much with this variety that's right here
that's so much darker than I thought I
was ending on taking this on a morphe
m5o for very just a large fluffy brush
usually I'm trying like shadows for the
first time I would try to go in with a
really really fluffy brush even if you
mess up you can blend it away
my mom's in here currently dissecting my
work no you don't this is what I want
you to use
right so you guys this is also my mom's
like when she's on the go bag I guess so
that's why she has the things in here
that she does version of yummy good well
you've got a lot of full coverage shit
in there first quick and easy how's that
it was too dark to put my transition it
was two of the way to daughter Tim vents
as you make it work in you make it work
we go in with PEG ale or we go in with
twig it's stunning I wonder where you
got it I'm so sure this is such a pretty
color wow I don't even use this myself a
good old brown smokey eye you can't go
wrong with the brown smokey eye I really
went too far in with that god damn okay
the blend is a little rough with the
shimmer and glow shadows just cuz that's
just what it is I brought it too far up
and I didn't blend quick enough so that
is just kind of how it goes that is the
top of the eye so far
smokey AF a little on the outer corner
because I just feel like you got to
you're gonna go in with the shimmering
glow shadows what are you gonna do
you're gonna blend quickly we're gonna
take that same highlighter from the
backtalk palette what's on the brow
bones you don't have another option
really packing it on and on the inner
corner give it a little bit of a pop
there we go that's so much better I'm
gonna take that what the fuck shade that
like really warm brown or just gonna
smoke this oh but then the lower lash
line that's gonna be on a morphe r42
look a large big packing brush it's so
fluffy and so large that access almost
like a blender as well so I'm gonna do
my other eye off-camera now I'll be
right back so this is the eye so far a
little dramatic
and by little I mean fuck so we have the
eyes basically done now I'm gonna do
some eyeliner and some mascara so she
has this is the it cosmetics of course
superhero eyeliner yeah by later oh my
gosh okay
wing not too bad there we go it's a
little bit out of place
what are you fucking where's the cap
okay guys so we have that part done I'm
gonna go and do some eyelashes and now
I'm doing some mascara and my mom has a
benefit roller lash which I'm so proud
of her I'll have some really good spin
here what the fuck is this though we
have a House of lashes eyelash curler
okay let's try that out
hmm it's a good spring so we're gonna
die off some mascara now benefit roller
lash save the drama for your mama but I
can't because this isn't my mama's my
mom did not put a pair of lashes in here
so I'm gonna go PI pair of lashes myself
cuz she flopped on that end for
I was like I'm gonna go ahead and apply
pair of lashes and finish the other eye
off camera and I'll be right back
to finish up okay guys I went in I
applied some Lily lashes off of a camera
this is the style Miami Miami is the
only pair that my mom will literally
wear for any event and we have these
little stick things maybe you should put
one in my inner corner though oh no what
the fuck this is but it's a duo smoker
probably not for the waterline so now
we're done with the eyes this is it
complete this is using my mommy's me so
we have options for lips I think we have
Jew a Dior she's such a bright lip
person when I can I find a Newton here
anywhere otherwise so this could work
the soft Sheen I cannot wear a full
fuckin red lip spring are you joking we
have bite what color we have a muff but
we're so gonna do that instead she's a
mini verdict a long wear and it says
Greco on it we got this from Urban Decay
my mom got our own little went to taking
bite lipstick gonna shade pink salt
without a lip liner mom come on
that's actually really pretty color Wow
and so comfortable it smells so good you
guys and that's it that's it this is a
fullface using only my mother's makeup
and honestly I have to say I am highly
highly impressed with my mom's
collection and of course she takes a lot
of things from my house she takes some
PR and I give her a lot of my PR and a
bunch of things like that so that's why
you guys probably didn't see any like
drugstore anything because my mom
doesn't use drugstore and actually she's
never ever ever worn drugstore she
always used a Mac my whole life growing
up she always wore Mac she was a Mac
girl at heart and now that I do what I
do she's all different types of brands
so she uses a lot of Dior I see
apparently she uses a lot of it
cosmetics she uses Urban Decay a lot she
has some ziwei stuff in here we have
benefit I thought this would be a really
fun video because I knew my mom would
have some good-ass shit I just knew I
felt my bones she's always wears makeup
all the time yeah hope you guys enjoyed
