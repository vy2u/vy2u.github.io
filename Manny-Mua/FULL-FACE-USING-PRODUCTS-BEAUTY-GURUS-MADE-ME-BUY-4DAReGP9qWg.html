So today's video
I am so fucking excited to be filming
and I'm going to be filming
a full face using products that beauty gurus made me buy.
Basically, this is people in the community... in the beauty world that I, that made me purchase them
and I'm gonna talk about what I think about the products, whether I thought the recommendation was good or not
and I thought it would be really, really, really fun
I actually got this idea from makeupbyjaack, who is another YouTuber
he actually did a video, and it was &amp;quot;Full Face Using Products MannyMUA Made Me Buy&amp;quot;
and I watched it... I thought it was so fucking funny, and I was watching it and I'm like
that's so funny that, that he bought products I had recommended
and I was like, wait... I've bought so many products that beauty gurus and other beauty influencers
have recommended to me, and I thought it would be such a fun idea
so, thank you Jack for giving me this idea
and I'm gonna of course leave his video linked down below that I'm talking about right now
because it is his idea, and I want him to give him credit.
Actually, I don't know if it's his idea originally or not, I just... that's the first video I saw personally, so
I'm gonna give him credit 'cause that's what I saw personally.
But anyway guys I'm going to stop rambling 'cause this is
a &amp;quot;Get Ready&amp;quot; so, it's going to take a little bit longer than usual.
So, let's go ahead and get into this video. As always if you guys do not like this video,
if you guys don't like me, please don't fuckin' watch it, you know the fuckin' drill with that.
Like, what's the point? What's the point in watching me if you don't like me? Just don't.
Just don't. I get it, I'm not everyone's cup of tea but I could be your cup of tea.
But anyway guys, if you guys do like this video, please go ahead and subscribe to my channel
if you're not already, and if you're new, what's up? I'm MannyMUA and welcome to my channel.
Thank you so much for being here, I appreciate it.
But yeah, let's get into this full face using beauty-guru-made-me-buy makeup.
OK guys, so let's go ahead and get started. First thing's first
I apologize for this hair, I apologize for my appearance, I literally just got back from the gym recently.
I took a shower at the gym, so I like am not the most, you know, like pretty-as-I-can-be.
You know? But I look not that pretty, and I need a haircut.
So uhh, no I know its rough, its rough in these streets.
OK guys, so what we're gunna do first. We are going to prime.
And first thing's first, we are gunna start off with the Bobby Brown Vitamin Enriched Face Base
And this I actually bought because of Mr. Jeffree Star.
He uses this so often, I was literally shook. He would literally dip his little
&amp;quot;booty&amp;quot; blender into this
And he would just literally put it all over the face. And actually guys as you can see
I actually have been using it. I have been using this a lot recently, and I absolutely love it.
It's so moisturizing. It's basically like a moisturizer and primer in one.
But it's just like, I don't know I can't even describe it. How it's just so good.
It makes my skin so hydrated and so plump and supple, but keeps my makeup on a little bit longer than usual
basically all I need is this. So, I really love it. Like I really, genuinely love this.
And I've been using it for a couple weeks now. And it's been great to me. It's truly been great.
When I apply it, my smile lines are smaller.
That's like a big thing for me. How I like foundation is how it reacts to my smile lines and how much it falls into my smile lines.
And I notice that when I'm using this primer/moisturizer, my smile lines are less.
This one, Jeffree, was a great purchase bitch.
And I appreciate you always using it, 'cause it fucking works good.
OK, and next product guys we are going with the foundation,
and this is the Laura Mercier Flawless Fusion Ultra Longwear Foundation
and this bad bitch was recommended to me by my homegirl
my country bumpkin, Laura Lee.
Laura Mercier. Laura Lee.
I see you there, girl. I see you. She always raves about this.
She always tells me that it's such a good foundation, and it stays on her face
so long throughout the day. I've actually worn this once and I really
really liked it. So I'm going to go ahead and use this.
And we're going to see how this reacts. Also, the coverage is
great. It's fucking great.
Also, you guys, I am the shade 1N2 Vanille
Not Vanilla, 'cause it has an e at the end. Vanille.
And honestly I just feel like it looks so pretty on the skin.
Like it really just looks fucking bomb, bro.
And it's actually like, kinda my color. Which is great, it's not even like too much darker than me.
You guys know I love to go darker. I do.
I feel like the coverage is beautiful, it's like a medium to full coverage.
The finish is so pretty and it lasts on the skin all day long.
PS, just in-case I forget
I apologise if I forget throughout the video, but I wanted to do this.
I bought this at Sephora, this is where I bought this
and I also bought the Laura Mercier foundation at
Sephora as well. I think it'd be cool to be able to say like where I
actually bought the product. As you can see
I don't know if you guys can tell but honestly,
the foundation is just fucking beautiful.
It really is.
Like I'm shook.
Laura, you fucking did that, thank you so much for this recommendation
because honestly, I love it.
I always use products that
other beauty people use like,
If they recommend something, I'm much more inclined to try it
than just seeing it on a shelf.
Does that make sense? I just feel like there's so many products nowadays,</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
