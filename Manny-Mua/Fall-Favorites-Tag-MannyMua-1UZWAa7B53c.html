today is going to be my fall favorites
tag yeah I was tagged by Jacqueline Hill
to do a fall favorites tag she came up
with this really cute adorable little
tag for like other people to do I know
there's a bunch of other like fall like
type tags on YouTube but she did like
Rowan Barry shouldn't have it and made
her own questions and so you technically
like I just tagged you in something so
you better do it and I was like
okay I think it's such a cute idea
Jacqueline thank you for tagging me I
think it's super super super adorable
I've been pulling things I've been
thinking about things like what are my
fall favorites I also really want to
encourage everyone to do their own
variation of the fall tag video the
people have had Jack been tagged in her
video I'm like yo I had to tag him - hey
so I need to come up with other people
to tag at the end of this video and like
put them down below but I encourage all
my followers to be able to do the same
tag I think it's such a cool idea and if
you guys can't record it let me know
what you guys just fall favorites like
the questions let me know what they are
like the answers to him in my comments
because I would love to know I really
would love to know I think that's so
cool as always you guys do like this
video if you guys still like me please
don't like I'm watching I'm trying to
say that as fast as I can for as long as
I can do it but you guys you like this
video and you guys do like me please
like this video and subscribe and
comment if you guys like this but let's
go and get into this fall favorites tag
so I'm gonna pull Jacqueline's video and
I'm going to read the little questions
that she lit for us all so first
question is favorite fall candle mm-hmm
I already know it with my favorite fall
candle like it is the one burning right
now let me grab it imagine if I
spilt a wax cuz it's burning right now I
would cry it is this one Oh
oh my why am I such an idiot like why am
I even doing this honestly what the
fuck's wrong with me it's the one
burning right now one one out I
talk too much
but my favorite fall candle is pumpkin
spiced cheesecake this is a fall candle
by Bath &amp;amp; Body Works I bought a bunch of
Bath and bioware camels recently jacket
actually really got me into Kendall's
because as I sound so dumb but I
never realized that candles make your
room smell so good I know it sounds
stupid I know it sounds super super dumb
but I never actually used candles
growing up whatsoever never had candles
in my room no idea like I just never did
at all but I never had candles in my
room so I never really got to like like
them or anything like that after like
being in Jacqueline's house so much and
her house smelling good all the time I
was like what the oh god but you
always have candles lit so I started
getting into candles more and my
favorite fall candle is the pumpkin
spice she's getting it smells so rich
and so good it smells like literally
like pumpkin spice you skate it smells
exactly like what you would think it
smells like it smells so good my
favorite candle ever is vanilla bean by
Bath and Body Works I love that good and
sweet scent I think it smells so good
and also buttercream icing has another
one of my favorites for fall it's
buttercream icing and spikes coming it
was my favorite for camera by far next
question
favorite lip color for fall okay let me
get them let me get them I had to go
with two does not just one I can do I
have to go with two and it's basically
the tone not even specifically the
Calypso but it's the tone of color that
I love so the first one for most my
favorite fall color is like unicorn
blood by Jeffery star I love a very deep
rustic reddish burgundy on the lip I
think it looks so freakin good on
literally everyone I warn you to carve
one on my channel before it is one of
the most beautiful like reddish maroon
brown colors I've ever seen it's
stunning I love colors like that and
then my second favorite is Veronica
Vienna sausage Beverly Hills it's a very
deep muggy plum Brown and I love colors
like this as well for fall because I
think they're so gorgeous again on
literally every single skin tone they're
so beautiful especially because
so much dimension in it as that pink has
MA it has brown it has a little bit of
gray it just looks so good on everyone
those are my two favorite colors for
fall unicorn blood by Jeffrey star and
Veronica love by an Associate Beverly
Hills I mean and serenity 2 by Gerard
cosmetics mm my collaboration but I mean
shameless plug right favorite drink
favorite full drink damn that's
tough I'm not really the type of person
that loves like pumpkin spice lattes I'm
not like that kind of person I don't
like coffee I don't drink coffee I don't
drink water ice
I don't drink moguls I don't drink any
of that because the caffeine is too
intense for me I already talk so fast
I'm are you really extroverted I've
already kind of miss pastic I mean I
thought you guys would ever think I'm
spastic at all miss calm little angel I
don't ever drink coffee I think that but
what I do love during the fall time is
getting peppermint hot chocolate by
Starbucks I think it's taste so freakin
bomb I don't like coffee or anything
like that if I'm ever going to Starbucks
in the fall time I'll grab a peppermint
hot chocolate instead with whipped cream
and a little bit of caramel drizzle
ahh mmm it just tastes like festive and
it tastes like Christmassy time even
though I know we're talking about fall
it just tastes like Christmas Ann tastes
like pollen taste everything come my
favorite blush this one's kind of hard I
was like what is my favorite blush
but I'm going with your blush right now
my favorite fall time blush by far I
finally realized that it was definitely
this one is Becca blush in wild honey
this is the most beautiful blush for the
fall apricot like a burnt apricot color
that looks literally good on every skin
tone even if your lighting complexion it
can look more like a bronzer if you're
deeper and complexion and look more like
a blush medium same thing it is so nice
pigmented it's smooth Becca blushes are
just and it just gives me like this
beautiful a keeper beautiful like a perk
know what it's matte so it just really
complimentary on literally every single
person and so well looks like right
there I don't you guys can see it in the
camera
fall worthy small looking favorite
clothing item I don't have to say my
favorite clothing items for fall are
hoodies
I love hoodies I'm actually a hoodie
year-round kind of person I were buddies
even if it's like 100 degrees
outside in San Diego I will wear a
hoodie specifically Grayson if you guys
follow me on snapchat you know Grayson
me and Grayson are like that I just love
the comfort of hoodies they're just
gorgeous and I love wearing hoodies I
think they're very comfortable and I
will wear a hoodie out
literally every single day of my life I
don't give a but for fall
specifically I will wear hoodies like
every day night and day so I'm saying
goodies for fall this is such a cute
favorite fall movie jacket so mine
Jacqueline stole mine out of my little
home she went like caca and pulled out
hocus-pocus a real quick for fall time I
think hocus-pocus is the fall movie fall
Halloween time starts to roll around you
know you have to watch hocus-pocus
because that doesn't make the year right
without it I would also say the crafts
another like which style of movie I love
which is I think which is a super super
super badass and I think the way that
Hollywood has portrayed which is this
super super super cool I'm not really
into like cult which is that like
worship Satan in that's not my
thing so I would have to say the
hocus-pocus is my number one but I love
watching the crafts around Halloween
times and things such a badass which
movie is well his focus is number one
fall movie sir food sorry good favorite
fall TV show when I was launching
Jacqueline's fall tags she talked about
scandal and scandal obviously like I'm
obsessed with scandal she made me get
into it and like I'm her aunt Kathleen
really like made scandal become part of
my life and became a became a year it is
candle that's like the weirdest thing
just like to describe a show but
literally like the show made me forget I
was Manny like made me forget who I was
as a person and I thought that scandal
was real for a long time it just
with you with you in that way
scandal is that good scandal i watch on
Netflix so I watched the entire series I
didn't even know it was during fall time
that it came out I know that scandals
coming back super super super soon I'll
be watching it obviously yeah but I had
no idea that scandal was a fall show
because I watched all the seasons on
Netflix so for me what I like to watch
during the fall time I love to watch
which shows my favorite like I'll watch
the entire season in this fall season is
American Horror Story come in it's my
like one of my favorite witch shows as
well as charmed I love charmed so much I
think it's such a perfect like get ready
for fall Halloween kind of show I just
love anything to do with which is I
think there's so badass as well as
scandal because that's actually on
during the fall time and I'm caught up
with the TV so I have to watch it I
forget that can breathe sometimes
honestly when I'm talking I forget that
I can breathe and I just say as many
words as I possibly can of that same
breath so like you don't have to breathe
at all what if I pass out imagine I'm
gonna pass out a video everybody's
favorite Thanksgiving
food okay this might be so random I
don't know who else does this my
favorite Thanksgiving food is actually
the day after Thanksgiving when you have
all the leftovers because obviously like
usually people have leftovers after
Thanksgiving because it's a huge variety
of food and everything like that so what
I like to eat for Thanksgiving or like
the day after Thanksgiving technically
is rolls of bread like you don't you
just get like those rolls of bread like
some Costco or like a little like
Mexican like shop that you go in and you
get like fine
so what I like to do is I get that and
then I'll put like mashed potatoes on
both sides I like the bread I open it
mashed potatoes then I feel like Turkey
in it and I just close it and it just
like a little like mashed potato turkey
like sandwich with great me too don't
forget that gravy I think that is so
good that is literally like what I look
forward to when it's Thanksgiving it's
like the day after and I get to eat
those little rolls like those little
sandwich rolls I don't know if I'm the
only one that does that I think it's
kind of weird but that's my favorite the
sound cheese or my favorite and last but
not least favorite Halloween cots
my most favorite one that I've done so
far was our Sailor Mercury following me
my friends we all dressed up as the
Sailor Scouts just three of us it was
like Mars Sailor Moon and Mercury and
house mercury I was the blue bitch so
maybe I'll insert a photo right here
maybe we'll see about that but I turned
up so fun and I thought was such a fun
time to go out and like drag and just
like my first like drag is Halloween so
that was like my favorite one of all
time because it was just so different
people were like living for our outfits
and Sailor Scout outfits they're like it
was and that being super super super fun
and I think I'm gonna go out and drive
again for this Halloween I think I'm
gonna be a witch but like a sexy witch
not like a ugly witch but like a
cute hot witch like a but oh ha
ha sexy has a bruja you know I'm
gonna be a sexy ass which was like
something black to silver hair cute
