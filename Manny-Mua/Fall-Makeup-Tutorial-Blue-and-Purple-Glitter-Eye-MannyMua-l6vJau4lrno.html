this I didn't even make it I decided to
do this very like plummy blueish coal
and warm tone I I think look really
really cool add some glitter in here I
have some pigment I have some makeup
geek pants that Mick has some sugar
you know this look is very wearable for
fought I think it's cool because has his
pop of blue in it and it's very
different I have like some maroon like
warm purples and browns you guys wanna
see how I got this look stay watching
and if you guys liked it comment
subscribe like do your thing I love
reading the comments and if you guys
don't like the look don't
watching you know Milan's room only so I
just realized I filmed that entire intro
thing or whatever I'm talking without
when I complete I had no mascara on the
bottom lashes on this one I probably
looked down for with one eye down and
went out how do you guys even watch me
I'm such a spaz I must as a leggy but I
will talk to us all later the hair don't
even talk about because they still may
have this - man hi everyone so
thing first thing what we're gonna do is
we're in a prime our lids with the Mac
Pro Longwear prime concealer thing it's
concealer otherwise the prime sorry
about it emerges Patel / lids now we're
gonna go in with a 224 and make a geek
Peach Smoothie all over our crease area
it's gonna be a great transition shade
for us when we're going in with other
shadows and you know the drill
put that in there and you don't
have to be very neat at all cool
now we're going to go in with a 2:17
style brush and Coco bear by makeup geek
as well we're going to pack that bad boy
all over the outer corner don't need me
very neat at all because you're gonna
blend it anyway just pack it density on
the outer corner and blend into your
lower crews saw now we're actually put
it on the inner crease to put that
in there nam is pigment err that shit's
really pigmented I'm not even kidding
like they're bomb as you can see I was
kind of moving up that Coco bear and
with no additional product on the brush
in to our crease area just to make it
kind of halo looking was really proud
with the light pressure and then go in
with that 224 blend out the entire thing
we want no hard transition at all now
we're gonna go in with a little pencil
brush and embark eyes shadow by MEK now
just gonna want a really outer corner of
our eye and the really inner corner of
our eye just to give us some depth and
definition it's a very warm chocolatey
brown color but it's very very dark so
to me great for this kind of like Moony
chocolatey eye they stuff that I top and
I'm just kind of running it into our
lower crease blending that bad boy out
with no additional product on that 217
brush at all
now we can go in with makeup geek bitten
right on top of the Coco bear shadow
basically we're just putting it right on
top of it kind of blending from the
embark and the Coco bear we're just kind
of blending it all together and putting
it into our lower crease as well I just
didn't give us that maroon tone to it
it's a matte color and it's beautiful
lock and same thing we're just gonna put
it right where we put our Coco bear and
blending it out very light pressure and
get that 224 blend the whole thing now
I'm going to go in with makeup geek
shimmer mint and that's gonna go right
over our entire lid well in our entire
lid I'm just gonna go over right in the
center area I swear I know looks kind of
weird right now but just bear with me
now we're grabbing Lumi by sugarpill
same brush just packing that right on
top of the shiverman not starting to
give us that reflect detail list to it
and I really really really love this
pigment for that reflect pop now we're
gonna go in with the elf lock and seal
and Mac reflect glitter in teal now
we're just going to Pat that bad boy on
a shimmer mint and luma shadow holy crap
and clearly I was not ready for the
amount of glitter I had on my hand
but I went a little ham not gonna lie
want to go hand with the glitter I think
not really cool just pack it on with
that ring finger no pinkie finger I'm
just kind of blending away any of the
extra glitter that might have fallen or
transferred hella high just blend that
 away and getting a big fluffy brush
dusting off all that glitter that fella
and a clean brush just to dust off the
top part and way on if you know what I
mean
now I'm going with that Peach Smoothie
color I'm just putting it on the bottom
of the lash line over the entire lash
line but I wouldn't do the exact same
thing we did on the top on the bottom
gonna grab Coco bear put it on the outer
third and the inner third we're doing
that whole thing now we go with bit in
same pencil brush put on the outer third
same thing in 1/3 you know the drill
you saw the whole thing etc etc etc etc
now we got sugar mint put that in the
middle just like that top and Lumi we're
grab bloomie put that bad boy in there
too and then of course as you guys get
them we're gonna grab that reflux teal
from Mac and pack that on there
first the well-concealed and then the
glitter
just kind of gain that 217 brushing the
whole thing just kind of blending
everything together I just like to make
sure everything's blended and gorgeous
look into the mirror because it looks
you know good now we're going to do a
little bit of a winged liner nothing to
cry cry
curl the lashes curl those pits right
there put on some benefit they're real
mascara
the bottom is the work it scares me
actually we're gonna go ahead and put
that mascara on the bottom poon even
though I'm really bad at putting mascara
on the bottom honestly I'm really
terrible at it but I've learned to get
better at it level of lashes now and I
lost the bitch
oh word that you other one go I
lost the other lash and in finding it
we're actually went in with level of
lashes in the style sexy kitchen and
it's beautiful and that's look okay the
both of the eyes are done so the lip is
