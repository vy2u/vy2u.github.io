barely out of side
I don't always laugh
those witches leading us love is
we have a trust hey guys welcome back to
my channel I don't know I giggle
everyday so today's video is going to be
a tutorial on this look I have going on
right now it's a very like deep maroon
lip with a really cool just neutral eye
that's not too too intense but it so
gives you a little pop of something like
this look is very fall appropriate
because it has that nice deep maroon
live but it's very neutral on the eye so
I feel like everyone can wear this look
honestly like even if you're like
sixteen or if you're like 40 you can
wear this look and it didn't look good
on literally everyone and this is the
time to adventure out to doing more
intense lips it's fall it's is the time
you guys need to get out of your comfort
zone and do some fun I actually
asked on snapchat what you guys wanted
to see and I got so many freaking
requests to do a more natural eye but
more of an intensive bold lip so I this
is what I came up with and I hope you
guys enjoy this I love it when you guys
like interact with me on Twitter or on
snapchat or whatever it is or an
Instagram any of my social media
platforms I really appreciate you guys
expending the time to comment me or like
my stuff or whatever it is I'd wanna say
thank you guys for that I talk to thank
you for all the things that you guys do
for me like I know it might seem like
mini school and not like that crazy but
it means a lot to me if you guys just
even if you guys like a photo of mine or
comment like I might not be able to
reply to every single comment but I know
that's out there and I read them and I
really genuinely appreciate it like from
the bottom of my heart I really do as
always if you guys like this video if
you guys still like me please don't
watch it a little bit but you guys do
like this video and you guys do like me
please like this video and subscribe to
our channel if you aren't already but
yeah let's go ahead and get into this
look okay great so let's go and start
this tutorial I already have the face
completely done like I just wanted to
have the face out of the way you know
the face takes forever and I've been
doing a lot of full face stuff recently
so I'm like you know what it's okay if I
skip back to the face today and there
right so we're only gonna using a couple
shades because this is gonna be more of
a natural look I only have four so let's
go and start with this bad boy great huh
there's some weird thing hmm okay so
first thing Spurs are gonna go in with
Peach Smoothie by make it weak I know
it's different for me I'm not using
beaches and cream
this look is gonna be a little more on
the natural side job I really don't need
to do like a transition or anything like
that on a morphe 27 brush right now this
is like basically my favorite like
fluffy blending brush just reminds me
like an e 40 by Sigma but a little bit
softer so that's why I like it so much
that's
go into the crease because this look is
so gonna be on the natural side I'm not
being neat with this whatsoever I'm
putting into the crease and then just
kind of do what I want with it and then
I'm gonna take another one my favorites
favorites from makeup geek
it's called frappe it's this gorgeous
neutral brown like I I love frappe like
I love rap yeah I know I don't really
use it on my channel a lot but I use it
more in real life so I'm gonna use that
on the outer corner and then run it on
sit a little a little bit and I'm
concentrating that on the outer corner
and just keeping it out there as well as
by the lashline and this is just to give
it some more added dimension to look I'm
not really doing anything I'm not doing
too much anything crazy just giving a
little bit more dimension so when you
look at the eye it gives you more of a
WOW factor rather than just being a flat
surface you know what I mean and for me
especially because I have kind of like
hooded lids going on so I'm like let me
just go ahead and not accentuate that
thanks thanks love you so much
basically the whole thing is like
neutral and brown which looks something
like that I'm gonna go in with I'm peach
Alice if I make a beak as well it is
just what other new duochrome shades
basically what it is it's like a gold
that reflects peach so I thought it
would be such an easy fun way to
incorporate a little bit of color on the
lid but not too much because I'm gonna
keep it more in the natural science
gonna place a little bit almost like on
the inner corner like the inner third of
my eye using my finger to just kind of
blend that peach 'less shade out oh it's
so cute I'm actually put on the whole
lid because I think it's actually really
really pretty I haven't used to seeing
this I'm like shocked sorry ooh tell me
that's not cute as and 4-3-3 again
just kind of putting out those edges
just a little bit of blend in again
we're not being too neat so number going
with the more of the M 508 which is a
small little smudgy brush is very flat
looks like that and then I'm gonna take
corrupt might make it because well this
is just gonna be a little bit of black
shadow I'm taking a very small baby
amount of it and I'm just going closest
to the lash line with that because I'm
not gonna do eyeliner with this look I
really want to keep it more in the
natural side but I want to keep a nice
amount of definition of my lashes so I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna run that corrupt
shadow along my lash line I'll even like
bringing it up a little bit over here
make it look like a shadowy
just a very very very subtle smoked out
like lash line at the top so now I'm
gonna gonna take a little bit of the
tradeshow lead liner by NYX I'm gonna
put that on my waterline it's the brown
one I actually really like this brown
liner because it's like a gel liner go
put a little coat of mascara on I'm
gonna take my roller lash pipe and I say
my favorite mascara and I put
coat of that on my lashes while the curl
just do a quick little coat of it just a
cute little coat cute little couple
mascara focus on me lean on me when
you're not strong but I'll be afraid so
so now that we have the eyes done like
alright have mascara on top and the
bottom I used the giga lash for the
bottom as always you guys already know I
don't wanna show you guys because there
just feel like you know I'm gonna take
the New Balance some lashes in the style
Serengeti which is a different style for
me I'm not using Bella minks I know you
guys proud this is like more of a flurry
like a wispy pair they have a couple of
shooting out past like the original
length I don't know how to explain them
feels like they have a lot of layers
just why don't you just don't stick okay
that's fine
just don't stick that's cool I know like
this there there's this really cool
intense like spidery effect not spidery
but they actually look really look
really cool I think they look super
super super badass what do you think
also new bounce um I'm an affiliate you
gotta save 20% off what the code man
anyway that's a really cool affiliate
program I think they're the they're one
of my favorite affiliates to be part of
because they actually take care of their
customers I'm like a lot of the other
lash brands I've like worked with him
like yo hook it up for my peeps and they
really do and I really appreciate that
about them honestly
the eyes are fini that means they are
done in a different language I'm like so
after right now chat or chicken um I
think yeah I am living for these lashes
though like actually living breathing
dying for them let me see if they're
even are they as even as I'm gonna get
perfect so we have our face completely
done I'm gonna go do the lips now I
really wanted to go with a more fall
intense lip because you guys had
requested that so now so I'm gonna do
I'm gonna go in with first colour-pop
lippie pencil in the shade poison thing
is one of their newest collections
actually I'm not quite quite sure that's
a cup a ruin a burning shade it's a very
warm honestly like I don't even I can't
even get over the fact that the
colour-pop pencils are so smooth and so
good and they're only like five bucks
yeah now your mouth was like a baboon's
asshole it's looking good so now that we
have our lip lip lined I'm gonna go
ahead and with Heather's by Anasazi
Beverly Hills this is one of my favorite
liquid lipsticks that they've ever done
I think it's absolutely stunning and I
think it looks just good on literally
every skin tone as long as you're
confident wearing the shade you can pull
it off I promise you like anyone can
pull this color off it's stunning oh and
that's what it looks like while it's
drying let it dry real quick and yeah
that's it that's it for the entire look
