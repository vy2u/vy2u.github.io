already I'm sweating already
I'm even started hey guys so I just
wanna make a quick video on the
favorites that I'm having for that only
you know um a lot people to do like
favorites of the month favorites out of
July they race you know and I'm just
like I don't buy enough makeup to do
favorites of a month so I'm just gonna
do a favorites of the moment that I'm
feeling it you know so let's just dive
right into it concerts kind of aha
I've never done one of these before so
you guys are have to be patient with me
um let me know what you think of them in
the comments below and if you guys like
these kind of videos and I'm gonna do
the more I always talk and snap okay we
start with first much at least I'm Lea
Ferrans double fool
let's start with a skincare item at the
moment my obsession is the there's
natural remedies cucumber witch hazel
okay if you don't know what like witch
hazel is just cut that out go
online and look that up but
honestly it's great for your skin
it's a toner it helps minimize pores it
gives a little bit of hydration to the
skin cetera et cetera just look it up
it's amazing and it smells like you
comfort and I have a weird obsession
with cucumber like like this smell it
smells like childhood you know oh not it
I'm gonna do next so I have two brushes
that I've decided that I was like
literally obsessing over this month this
month see I'm not ready doing it I've
been obsessing over for the last couple
of months and one is the Real Techniques
expert face brush and it's basically
like a little buffing brush very dense
very thick and the synthetic fiber so
it's really easy to clean and it's not
going to harbor bacteria like a real
natural hair brush would so you know um
that Shay is my jam i fuse it with cream
with liquid and with powder so just one
of those all over great brushes and I
things like 9 bucks so it's a Lian next
brush another Real Techniques could I
walk in over them is the setting brush
and it's what I love about this brush is
that is so tiny and it's still very
dense and it's also synthetic all the
Real Techniques brushes are synthetic so
I really love that because they're so
easy to clean and I just love this one
because it's all tiny and I really can
get into that you know like that oh yeah
that's the I use this is just to set my
under eye concealer and my like area air
and my areas No
and I use it to set my under eye
concealer and like in the t-zone setting
that area with my like banana powder
interchange so I'll have to use that or
if you wanted to you can also use this
for like cutting your contour with or
something really precise just go on the
tip cut that she cut that like you
cut your bottle sometime okay next item
you need something to clean our brushes
the way fountain so I've been literally
obsessed with the Beauty Blender solid
cleanser it's like Lena it's a lateral
bar honestly what's great about it is
that it's a liver like a little bar soap
like that comes out it's like the
little bar so like don't drop the slope
it's like that it's meant to clean the
Beauty Blender and you know as you guys
know the bead one is a bitch to clean so
I like to use this mad boiling for my
brushes because it really gets out
everything from the brushes it gets out
the bacteria gets up the dirt itself the
the nasty that you don't want and
gets that out so I would really
recommend it all you have to do is wet
it let your brush with the the cleanser
swirl a in there in vain which you
can metal yeah in your hand put it in
your hand a little bit world a brush in
there wash it and it's done and it dries
so fast with this like it dries stupid
fast so hop on it if you haven't already
next we're gonna do some lip stuff
working to some little lip item so lip
items of the month or the sweater or you
know like the my obsession the NYX lip
liner called peekaboo neutral and it's
basically just an amazing amazing
neutral shade that is just so great for
lip lining and your if you're going for
a really natural lip line I like to
overdrawn my lip so I really need
something to act as like my natural lip
that's like still gonna be really good
and really like sharpened defined I'm
like I'm desperate here any got another
one you know so I'm gonna just watch it
real quick : I'm wasting in your lucky
obviously the amazing part about this is
that it's four dollars from one and
that's like obscene that's what it looks
like look at it it's pretty now honestly
it's just a great matte lip liner it has
this boldly bare lip liner from Mac and
soar from the liner from Mac had a baby
that's bigger boon intial stuff
obviously like those are my favorite
line in the back gathered a hanging out
next is what I'm actually wearing today
this is the Gerlach tick matte lip paint
in starlet it's just really beautiful
like Kylie Jenner e-type deep mommy
color and I have this with this that's
all I have on so they just do the lip
pencil all over my lips
paint over it and it gives me this matte
gorg just like really fooled in you know
like it and what's great but this is
smells like my kind of minty even though
it's Mac it's not a drying kind of Mac
what is what's in here
Shannon thrown away the box so I
couldn't read what's in it all I know is
that it's extremely hydrating for a
matte lip paint it's not like ones like
the ones at Sephora that are pretty
drying in like hard on the lips I've
never had a problem at this one drying
on me ever ever ever and it feels really
great let me swatch it let me swatch it
what it says this this lip liner got
turn into a lip paint that's that look
beautiful I love it
her lactic they're great I haven't
really heard much about them I got this
when I was at Fame Expo
she's just an amazing amazing
hard-working hard-working woman and I
really appreciate brands that are really
really hard-working and have just like
start from the bottom but then they
write rose up by themselves and she's
that kind of person so obviously I had
to take it and we're gonna wear it cause
it's really pretty
next okay next one is Babette from one
crime I'm sure you guys have heard like
a tittie ton about above it from like
pork okay but it basically is the nude
like the two new tones of the line this
one is like a very nude soft pink color
can you even see know what I missed
watching while I would describe the Lime
Crime textures for the lipsticks as a
bright pigmented satin formula they're
very similar to the MAC lipsticks when
they go on they smooth on really really
easily but they're very pigmented like
yeah they're just pigment into
 so that's what that looks like
can you even see this one right here and
I top it on top off there's like other
colors I really if I want to make it
lighter and more pinky tone on top to
 on top of it so it's just a perfect
like coating color or if I want to do
with this is the binder and that is done
next
my favorite palette of the moment is the
chocolate bar to face palette this was
you and me know this palette seriously
it's so amazing what I love about it so
much is that the colors that I would
want to be matte like the Browns and
like the the ma be colors and the soft
transitional colors those are the colors
and our matte so like the ones I use the
most often this guy this guy this guy
this guy yes they so these guys I use
the most and one two three four five
that's not Matt one two three four the
four colors I use the most are all matte
and they're beautiful transition shade
is like a chocolatini
is really pretty
like Charlene is my so good a
really best smoke bomb and I just love
this product it has 16 colors in it I
think it's like 49 bucks but all the
pans are pretty decently deep so you're
not gonna really run out of it very fast
I use like these all the time in all my
tutorials so if you haven't jumped on
this ship yet I'm waiting jump on but
it's a for my dish it next is a little
eyebrow item obviously everyone is
obsessed with the anastasia dipbrow
which i am of course
two up two things with it because I love
that it's waterproof and I love that
it's really intense looking but
sometimes I don't want a really really
waterproof look and I want it to be very
natural looking and kind of feather it
out and that's what this is this is the
brow rehab brow creams and the color Eva
this is the one that's mostly similar to
my color like this deep dark brown so
the difference between these color these
and the MSI's your do brows are these
are not waterproof and they will come up
if you like rub them off like they will
come off so be careful with them and you
have a lot of like time to work with
these this one is not waterproof so you
have a good time to blend it through and
just get like a little comb and just get
it through you know they have seven
colors there are 18 dollars and they
have three point four grams in it the
anasazi one has four grams in it so that
is that could be a big deterrent for
people you will get more in the Nastasia
Paul mains
then you will with these guys but like
you'll never get rid of like either of
them you need like a little tiny baby
like a matte light and you're good
let me swatch it I'm just going to
bocek's watching kinda that's too much
mm-hm so they're pigmented I was
like one little one too pigmented that's
me
moving on up moving on a favorite
highlighter of the moment basically
favorite highlighter of my life is
actually albatross by NARS what's great
about this is that the yellow tone
highlighter and it's very very finely
milled NARS is beautiful and NARS has
amazing amazing things so it's gonna
come off as a golden shimmer rather than
like it looks white which I mean it is
it's white but it reflects gold so if
you were to put it on you like I'm
actually wearing it today not that you
can see cuz this light is just
me I'm sweating in them you just be
careful if you're really tan or you're
like more in the darker complexion it
will come off ashy onions so you need to
kind of find that equivalent but because
of me I'm like an NC 20 buck in pls okay
it works for me and it's beautiful and
it's very very very like natural
now I really like that next holy grail
of all contour highlighting things egg
Tantra is the anasazi contour kit of
course people are going no sparkly about
this kit and they have been forever I'm
jumping on that wagon because I really
love it comes with six shades I've used
all of them and I use all of them the
one that use the most oh or the middle
to these two because this one I love to
use it under as my under eye concealer
setting this one I use as my brow bone
highlight this one is just like my
contour that I use all the time because
it's very cool tone and I kind of like
to use my bronzer a warm tone and then
cool tone with my contour I love the
contrast against so I've been using that
every single day I shouldn't
cost as much I really shown it but I'm
trying I'm trying to be a good like not
a customer next is the makeup geek
eyeshadows I'll get three of them
because that's the only ones I got hey
next up I need it more because they're
 bomb make see the ones I got or
the my like the ones I was wanting the
most are Peach Smoothie Coco bear
incorrupt beautiful transition shade
isn't all over great color because
that's like more like a biggie neutral
tone to it like a little bit uh like
it's kind of warm you know and then Coco
bears is really red based Brown which
I'm absolutely obsessed with I love a
red Brown that's as if Swiss chocolate
and brown script from Mac had a baby fat
as dance corrupt is a beautiful just
like black matte color all these are
matte and I like about colors more so I
had to get them and I'm literally
adjusting them they're so so so
pigmented as you guys know everyone
talks about makeup geek eyeshadows and I
was trying to like see it's really that
good so i swatched him at a famous but
I'm like I need up there right now thank
you
last two items you guys were getting
down to the we're getting down to the
wire we're almost an ok the last two
items are actually eyelashes that I've
been little bit toward eaten
dying for I love them so much they're
from love love lashes you can just I'll
put the link down there for the little
website and what I love about them is
after main care lashes that are cruelty
free so that's absolutely amazing what
they do is they closed them in care
through natural shedding
rather than having to shave am Enoch
animal to get the hairs what I love
about them is that the reinforced cotton
bands so they're gonna last a long time
like these guys will ask you like three
months if you take care of them so I
would say to invest in me lashes like
they're kind of on the pricier side
they're around like 28 to 30 dollars but
one paper to last you about three months
and you're if you're taking good care of
them so let's
look at the lashes on first pair is
sultry that's what they look like sultry
they're very wispy and feathering and
this is the next pair which is in the
style Bambi also very very very wispy
but they're a little bit more full than
these sultry lashes are I love it oh my
god hello I can freakin do this and zoom
in and you can see my swatches NYX lip
liner galactic lip paint Bobette Eva
Braun cream from brow rehab cool so
that's all the products I have these are
just the items like right now that I'm
