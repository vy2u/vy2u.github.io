tell you it's going to be my
month is this February favorites of 2015
so yeah hopefully you guys enjoyed this
video if you guys don't like it don't
 watch it well I wanted to go
real good with that one I wanted to be
like shanking ok cool so let's
go and just start this bitch because I
feel like it's gonna take a while I have
a bunch of favorites for this month so
let's just jump right into it like jump
like hop in this is it that's nice we're
topping in so we're just gonna start
with some skin care items first I don't
really talk about tinker that much I so
need to make a my skincare routine video
because I am really big into skincare
and I think that singer is so important
like the skin you have as a skin you're
gonna have for the rest of your life and
I think it's really important to start
taking care of it at a young age so
we're gonna start with two items first
so the first one we're gonna be talking
about is the soap &amp;amp; Glory the righteous
butter body butter holy crap holy crap
as you guys know I talked about the soap
&amp;amp; Glory hand food a little while ago in
a different favorites video last month
somehow our glory saw my video and they
emailed me and they're like hey like we
thought you liked our hand who that's
really cool of you like don't try
anything else and I'm like when
literally I was like dying John and I
used soap and glory like I was using
their stuff when I worked at Sephora
maybe if I felt like cut any kind of
trying I would go to the body butter and
I would use it all time at work and I
just never I don't know why like but I
stopped working there I never purchased
it I'm stupid but literally this is the
best body butter I've ever tried and I
found a couple there was nothing my
favorite smells amazing it is so so
refreshing to the skin I get out of the
shower I put this on my skin it absorbs
beautifully into the skin and doesn't
leave me that greasy nasty film you get
um 10.1
ounces if you let the time does
shit-ton literally I've been using it
for like two weeks now and I barely made
a dent it's so good you cannot go wrong
with soaking glory some glories on my
favorite brands sold at Sephora and this
tub is not even that expensive was like
probably like 20 bucks it's so good I'll
leave it everything linked down below
but if you guys are nervous about buying
anything was áfourá they have an
amazing return policy so yeah try it out
okay the next one is gonna also be from
soap &amp;amp; Glory and this face wash bitch
had me yeah Dean
gagging in a good way I've been going at
it hard for two weeks every single date
using it that's all it's been used like
this is like I feel like it's like
a regenerating it's like the
bottle I don't know how I use this two
weeks every single day um this face wash
is there Fineman see facial wash
three-in-one daily detox it says that
it's good for every single skin type but
I think that it's a little bit a little
bit drying when I stop watching my face
and I like dry it it leaves me an
amazing cooling sensation but after it's
like done like drying on my face I feel
like a little bit of a slight tightening
very slight but the tightening on the
list so I feel like if you're extremely
extremely dry you might not like this
but for people that are more combo oily
normal you guys are going to be obsessed
with this like this takes off my
Kat Von D foundation on my face like
this thing cleans your face crazy it's
crazy that literally like cleans out
absolutely everything I don't like I
feel like right now like this is like my
hip session and like you just don't
wanna part with that no I was like these
cute little pink microbeads in it with
natural super fruit yuzu I have no idea
what the use it is but it's it's in
here whatever it is is in your heads mom
we move right along we're next we're
gonna go in with a primer that I've been
living for I love love love this Tarte
primer it's the clean slate poreless
12-hour perfecting primer this one is so
good for people that are more combo oily
or normal skin it leaves you this nice
silky feeling to the skin it feels like
kind of silicone II but what I love
about tart is that tart is like all
natural their motto is high-performance
Naturals like it's all about natural
ingredients so I think that if you're
like combo oily and you want a good a
really good prime that's gonna really
keep the makeup on a lot longer make
your skin feel amazing conceal the
appearance of pores you guys are really
trying out that clean slate poreless my
Tarte it is so good so good next is a
foundation combination that I've been
wearing non-stop is what I'm wearing
today it is the Kat Von D lock-it
foundation mixed with Mac face and body
Kat Von D lock-it foundation is a
mattifying foundation that is full
coverage that like literally like almost
strikes with basically like a powdery
finish transfer-resistant the is
like glue does not come off it is like
shellac on the face full coverage
intense which I mean it's great for a
lot of people a lot of people that are
more on the oily side you guys are gonna
love this so much to keep the oil at bay
it's an amazing amazing amazing
Foundation however for those of you who
don't want that much coverage who are
more on the dry side or like combo
normal side I would mix it in with Mac
face and body foundation this foundation
is a very sheer foundation leaves like
almost like it like basically lose you
like nothing like this is a guy
foundation like guys love wearing the
fixin's body 180 so we're comeback guys
we're coming I would always match them
to face and party because it was so
natural give me more of a dewy satin
finish and it like it's transfer
resistant so these guys together it
ain't coming off your face when you mix
them together gives you this nice full
coverage foundation but it doesn't leave
you feeling nearly as Mac and it's
definitely more of a you can work with
it a lot easier when you pump out Papa
this out of the cap on the ow it's so
viscous it does not move anywhere but
the face of body is so liquidy like you
can hear how the Cody is inside the
inside the to do this nice beautiful
like creamy foundation that I love love
love wearing in Kat Von D I'm shade 48
and face and body I mix it with n1 if
you are really into full coverage and
you really want a hardcore matte finish
that's and keep you like not doing at
all like mad as drop the day this
is the foundation for you but if you
aren't if you're more into like natural
full coverage does that even make sense
natural full coverage which I am more
into then I would try it mixing these
together and it is I don't know what
that is but it just like God I wish I
knew a word for everybody don't that
just like a random item but I've been
using these bad boys all I've used even
fast like two months I don't to mention
them because they're they're so good so
these are the me Z Me's headphones and
they look like this they're like this
wooden paddle headphone they remind me
like a lot of like it's like of dre
beats honestly so when I put them on
they completely cover my ears and it's
like sound resistant so like I can
literally cannot hear anything else now
actually started using this to help me
edit because in my house like my house
is a very loud s place so I use
these to kind of block out sound so it's
absolutely amazing for like really
helping me catch sounds that I would
have missed if I didn't have the
headphones so things are absolutely
mazing I think they're kind of pricey
I'm not gonna lie the brand
wasn't kind enough to send me this in
like my post office I received him and I
was like what the these are amazing
better than dre beats my brother he has
dre beats he said these are better he
loves these he and my mom will both take
them from me but I just want to say like
I think these are
so lemme see the car I say leave a link
down below if you guys aren't interested
and good high quality headphones like
this is like a brand from like Sweden or
something like that I don't remember
I'll leave a link down below $10 even
pay me to talk about them I just think
they're sickening sickening
other cue let's go ahead and talk about
another face product I have been
obsessing over this month is hoola
bronzer by benefit I don't know why I
never got hoola earlier I usually use
that support all the time I kept it on
clients all the time if they're looking
for a nice matte bronzer that gives a
more of a neutral look it's definitely
more when you look at it it's definitely
more on the neutral Brown signed a
little more cool tone than it is warm
I'm using I'm wearing it today and I
think it's absolutely beautiful it's
it's seriously one of my favorite
bronzer that I own if you're in timeout
bronzers that give you a nice like
really pretty sunkissed glow but it's
not too too warm doesn't give you an
orange it leaves you literally like no
orangie warmth at all I gives you much
more of a bronze look that's much more
for like contouring any things like that
so I really love this one I mean you're
so definite try it out but if it has
super cute products and super great
packaging I just I think their stuff is
super adorable so hoola by benefit it's
amazing it's so talked about all over
YouTube for a good reason it's amazing
amazing amazing it's amazing that's how
we think it is let's go and talk about
Leia she is hmm so a lot of you guys
know that I have been obsessing like
literally like freaking going crazy over
blinking beaut lashes they're mean
clashes that I am an affiliate with
linking is seriously one of my favorite
- Browns I've ever tried and they're
definitely the most cost-efficient as
well every pair is $30 was like the one
that they did with Samantha from battle
ash those are 35 but every pair is $30
firming pair and then also I have a code
mg 10 which saves you 10% so you get
there for 27 I've never heard of the
means for $27 nowhere have I ever
especially these ones these ones are
literally my favorite meme brand of all
 time so I talked about two pairs
that I'm obsessed with batters like my
go-to like my ride-or-die one obviously
the paranoia right now okay number seven
and what I love about them so much is
that literally with the blinking mute
pairs you don't need to do anything you
literally set them on the high and they
flare by themselves like huh you have no
idea how much I annoys the out of
me when I do the lashes
like play with them for so long just to
get them to be like extended and give
you that nice curl these ones you don't
have to do that like you don't do that
at all with number Seven's they're
amazing another pair that I'm obsessed
with is this parent number one which
look like this they're much more natural
wispy pair than the ones I'm wearing
right now it looks so natural on the eye
they give you so much definition they
give you so much Flair that parent is so
like different prom or like any event
like that number ones are so so
beautiful
seventh and ones but I can live I can
swim in seven ones and be happy from us
my life like that's how much I love them
like a hands live I'm like oh my god
like love so now we're gonna go and talk
about some lip products that I've been
upstanding with let's go and just talk
about the lip combo I'm wearing right
now because it's literally like one of
the lip combos I've been so obsessed
with lately so let's just go ahead and
top with the first one it is the Too
Faced melted liquid long wear lipstick
and melted peony which is basically a
very pretty light babydoll pink color
this color is my base it's so
ridiculously stunning it's just huh it's
not super super light but it's
definitely a nice beautiful babydoll
pink colors on top of that I have
buttercup by Gerard which is one of my
favorite pinks like of all time I'm
gonna swatch it next to melted peony
really pretty light light light maybe
the OP in color and then on top of that
I know I'm like so I'm so stacked with
my lips right now it's on you're funny
on top of that I have Agatha by Kat Von
D which is a super popular nude honestly
I'm not the biggest fan of the Kat Von D
the lipsticks like the formula of them
because I feel like they kind of go on a
little bit patchy but I think that the
colors are so freakin ridiculously
beautiful and I think that they they
last a long time on the lip besides like
the fact they have to deal with Apache
is it's worth it like it's all worth
that I've talked about it with a loliter
lipstick it's so worth it to me so this
is what they all look like so these
three stacked is the lip I'm wearing
basically let me just show you guys what
it looks like
zoomed in so that's the lip combination
I'm wearing at the moment I think each
of them individually are so ridiculously
stunning I love like babydoll pink
colors it's like one of my obsessions I
feel like it's a pretty color on me I
feel like it's a pretty color on
absolutely everyone the most universal I
feel is definitely melted peony it's the
darkest of the Pink's so this is gonna
look good on literally everyone like
every skin tone everyone
it'll look beautiful on and I love this
lip combination it feels amazing on the
lips it doesn't feel drying at all
so ever it leaves me let my satin finish
and I think it's stunning okay cool so
the next lipstick I'm gonna be talking
about is Berlin liquid lipstick by Kat
Von D as well the Kat Von D liquid
lipstick formula you guys I am so
obsessed with it it's so weird to give
Zi long wearing lacquers have lips like
it's like they hug my lips like they hug
them like they're hugging them like
they're long wearing they're not too
drying at all they're not they're
definitely not as drying as someone I've
tried in the past like I tried ones that
are ridiculously drying the cat Wendy
ones are not drying like too drying to
me they're not too drying I'm very
hydrated a list because I'm like a freak
about chapstick I'm a freak about like
hydrating them so they're not trying to
me hopefully they're not trying to you
guys the color I'm obsessed with is
Berlin I was wearing it in my best of
morphe brushes video and I think that
this lip color is absolutely stunning
only like- anything after but say about
them is that I feel like to get a really
intense color payoff I have to do two
layers of this one which is not it's not
a big deal to me at all like I don't
care about a lot people will care about
that that you're not getting like that
intense confrontation right away
they're definitely longer wearing that
like the anasazi ones for example i'm
slahser ones those ones remind me like a
long way matte lipstick but they don't
remind me a little liquid lipstick they
are definitely not nearly as long
wearing has like the Kat Von D ones are
I ate and I drank and she liked that in
these not drink alcohol
I can't drink like soda Berlin is gonna
be such a hot color for the summertime
I'm already predicting it Berlin my Kat
Von D for summer yeah I love this color
I think it's absolutely beautiful get it
now
and last but not least okay so it's
still backstory so me and Patrick we're
in LA during our I met ship me and
Patrick got invited to a good amount of
events and things for my brands and
