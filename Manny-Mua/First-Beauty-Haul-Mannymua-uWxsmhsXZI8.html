past weekend with Marlena from makeup
geek the CEO of cookie and so we her
went shopping mama we wish we shopped
the house down we went to South Coast
Plaza and it is like the biggest bowl
I've ever been to in my entire life it
has everything and so we went into a
Sephora I know we're like let's just buy
some um everything I just gonna say
this right now I'm just gonna disclaimer
because I know we will ask me because
they know how I am and they know my
channel like my channel
I'm not everything here I bought myself
a lot of things that Marlena she was
just so kind and she's like oh my god
like I had to get you that such a lot of
these things that she got for me and I'm
so so so so grateful to her for even
gonna cry I am NOT gonna die I'm so
grateful to her for doing that for me
and I just I really appreciate it and I
think mean me and Marlena are like this
now and I would say she's like when I
make a close friend of mine down and so
I can't wait to go back up to see her
and yeah so let's get this all started
because that's what the point of this
video was okay this is gonna be a little
collective haul give me a little
collective thing from this past week so
I got the stuff from LA and then I got I
got some other stuff that was sent to me
let's do it what's in this box
No so it's in here I've been a little
Neiman Marcus bag even marksburg me
Neiman Marcus you never you never first
things first we're gonna start I got the
hourglass ambient lighting palette I'm
so stoked about this bitch because I see
it all over the place all over the place
but I never had the money to buy it so
looks like this I'm actually wearing at
my cheeks today none of the awesome Tom
see that glow
daddy's mean I know this was a like do a
haul and like not use the stuff in your
haul but I really follow the rules of
that so happy lighting hourglass lo
me I love it yeah so next I'm
gonna do YSL lipstick so I got three
Wiseau lipsticks I have the color number
one which is on my lips right now I'm
wearing number one which the packaging
stole I never knew like how bond these
words I never tried on like my slip
sites or anything like that so when I
tried this on the loose
time I'll just like I need them all fall
so this is number one looks like this
and they smell like Mingo like fruity
mango e goodness I when you put them on
like what people say they go on like
butter that is a understatement
they go on like angels tears I
don't even know they go on so so so
smooth that's number one and I'm wearing
my lid I got two more I got the number
15 which looks like the fiddle
it's like this orange e orgy it's like a
salmony color it's a good salmon color
thing and I'm obsessed with this
coming I'll have to do it look with this
one because I want to swatch them cuz I
want to only think you know I'll
just watch them I'll swatch it it
 it I love you guys like life
Hunter zoom your asses in I'll save your
asses in later swatched and then I got
number 3 which I love so much
it's like this dark nude like brownie

like plumbing and browning oh you know
I'll swatch that one till you can't even
tell huh housing dresses that hold up
porno chic knit okay that is number
three and that is number 15 cool okay
why selves are done not why sold not
done completely um next I got the YSL
future ink foundation it walks like
leave this packaging though can
we just talk about it like how
beautiful it is it comes with a little
paddle I don't even know what to do with
that but I love it I don't care
yeah so I've heard a lot about this
foundation I'm excited to try it out I'm
actually this today I'm actually wearing
it for the first time is for someone
wearing it and I really do I do love it
um the only negative thing I have to say
about this foundation is that if you
have any type of like skin that's lifted
it will catch the foundations and catch
on that so you have to watch out
for that and luckily I'm pretty oily
momma's oily so it's not too too too bad
for me but it's still it still stucked
his spots I had that were dry so just
watch out for that that's the only thing
I have a complaint to complain about
this but so far I felt like
velvety goodness on my skin
can't wait to review by the way
ever let's just go down that foundation
route I got the Estee Lauder Double Wear
obviously you asking about this on the
phone line this is what it looks like
there's no queue to meet double wear
stay in place makeup
and this is this bitch is full coverage
I wore this when I was inhaling and my
ass had it on all thing for like
12 hours and it was still full
coverage beautiful goodness there if you
guys saw the pictures on my Instagram
and you saw like the makeup I was
wearing she is what I was wearing this
girl right here what's next okay next
foundation last and next foundation is
the Giorgio Armani luminous silk
foundation it looks like leave this cute
little bottle yeah I'm tried this one on
yeah I've been tried it on my skin or
anything like that but it comes a little
pup I love little functional come a
little pump and that's the color and
4.25 so hopefully that bitch matches me
goes it's gonna suck Fitness it really
oh why should I tell you with my colours
on so Armani 4.25 Estee Lauder I am in
sand and indie YSL I'm in warm ivory and
that's co I'm wearing today I think I'm
at Disney very good good job girl they

rest of lip stuff so cuz I'm a live come

in peony peony peony it was like this
and these are all over the places well
they're like so cute I tried it
on already and you just squeeze a little
tube and cut pours out and I got this
colors like a very like it's like a baby
doll pink that's how I would describe it
baby doll pink not too pinky where I
can't wear it because I can't wear a lot
of pink I'm I just sometimes I
don't like pink on me to cope maybe
because I'm a boy maybe cuz I'm
why I don't like white people sometimes
now we'll know mama life next I got the
Estee Lauder pure color high-intensity
little Akua its lacquer but I started to
say liqueur think I'm advancing
and I don't even know what
I'm talking about
and looks like this cute little thing
and all you got to say about this one is
that it's kind of I try to not it's kind
of sticky I'm not really the biggest fan
