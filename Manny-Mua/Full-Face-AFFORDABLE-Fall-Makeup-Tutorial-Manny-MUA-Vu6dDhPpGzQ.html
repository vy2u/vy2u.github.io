today is going to be a video on this
look I have going on right now this is a
full face using affordable and drugstore
makeup only for a fall really fall fun
dramatic look and I didn't want to
create a look like this for a long time
that was just a really fun dramatic
intense look I don't really do a lot of
cool tones in my everyday life I just
don't I like to do warm tones I think
warm tones call them at me more but I
feel like I wanted to go really cool to
them today and go really opposite of
what I like to do normally just to try
to jump out my chromosome for you guys
because you guys do challenge me a lot
of the time to do more looks and so I'm
trying for you guys so hope you guys
like this look it is again all drugstore
and affordable products so I really hope
you guys enjoy it last year I did a
drugstore fall makeup tutorial and it
turned out really really great and I
love you guys really loved it so I
wanted to just kind of pay it forward
with that kind of aspect of a video and
just do the same exact thing like I did
last year as always if you guys like
this video if you guys don't like me
please don't put too much another drill
with that peace out if you guys don't
like this video peace go we going with
you but you guys do like this video

to my channel if you want already and if
you knew what's up at mani MUA and
welcome to my channel thank you so much
for being here I really appreciate it so
yea that's going into this nice dramatic
fall festive video
okay guys let's go and start on today's
a video I'm gonna be doing a full face
today with using more affordable
products I'm really excited Sam and I'm
like in a fordable slash drug story type
video in a while so I've been really
wanting to do one especially during the
fall time I feel like fall is just I
love fall I love fall I fall in love
during the fall no I don't lying
I don't love anyone but was doing start
a video to again we're gonna do a full
face using more affordable products so
primers that we're gonna be using today
I'm gonna be taking the NYX pore filler
for the t-zone I'm gonna be taking the
loriel magic glooming for the rest of my
face you guys know I love the L'Oreal
magic Lumi I think it works extremely
extremely well it looks well you
let me never try this NYX pore filler I
just have it in my drawer almost looks
and feels like the benefit Porefessional
so I'm assuming that's kind of what's
supposed to act like I looked up reviews
online and they weren't like amazing but
they weren't terrible either some of
something is just gonna be a chill
average pore filling primer I have
decided that today even though we are
using more affordable products slash
drugstore products we are going to be
looking like Tom Ford when we
walk out this house do not play me
L'Oreal Lumi do not play me we are gonna
be looking snatched I will not
let us walk around looking like what's a
shitty ass brand that we can compare to
I'm one of the consumer drugstore still
have amazing things we're not gonna be
walking around like we are fill in the
blank if you guys are watching this in
the comments fill in the blank primed
and ready to go not too bad okay so
let's move on to foundation now I'm so
excited try this out this is the Milani
concealer perfect two and one I have not
try this yet I've heard amazing amazing
things about it though so I really want
to try it out so I bought it
um this is actually in my haul video
from the drugstore haul I live in use it
since then yeah yeah it's that I know
I'm going to show you zero to natural
that's what when I grab I'm praying it
will fit me I like that it is a
drugstore foundation and it has a pump
I'm very impressed I did three pumps
think that'll work I can make any
foundation color work that's like around
my tone as long as I can like
highlighting bronze up and she's like
I'm fine when I put it on the little
Real Techniques Beauty Blender version
that is yellow that is yellow
okay you know what we're gonna make it
work we're going to make it work because
you know what we are sickening and we
are Tim Gunn and we're gonna make it
work oh my god this covered in ice
what the I'm in breath but again it
is extremely yellow but I think you know
what we can really make this work as
long as you blend it down the neck and
on the ears we can definitely get away
with it for sure oh that's kind of
burning my mustache area that I
shaved this morning
mmm mmm do you guys have a trouble
finding your shade in this foundation
because I feel like this is really dark
on my skin now I have to put it on my
neck which you guys know I don't really
like putting foundation on my neck but
to make it work we're gonna have to
literally zero zero two I'm assuming
zero one is like the lightest shade it
goes and then like what the and I'm
not even like that that okay I'm pretty
light I'm pretty freaking light but I'm
not like white I'm not like translucent
you know so I feel like this might be
really tough for people define their
shade on this so honestly like this only
seems beautiful I'm kind of limping so
we're gonna do one more pump I want to
put it on a little morphe brush this is
the e6 one of my favorite flat top
kabuki 's I'm gonna put that with it on
my neck fog fine we'll live well lit
this is gonna be real funny seeing that
before and after shot yeah okay so this
is the foundation I have to say I'm
extremely extremely impressed like do I
not look pretty freaking bomb with a
sunnysean the coverage is so there and
it doesn't feel insanely heavy or
anything like I'm really impressed I may
have found one of my new favorite
drugstore foundations other than the
l'oreal preventable hmm I'm in Vice
I'm impressed okay so now we're
going to go ahead and do our concealer
I'm gonna be taking a mixture of the
Maybelline master conceal and the
Maybelline fit me I love my bling
concealers I think they absolutely kill
it with concealers and they just
slay my whole life the fit me is a
little is more like a medium coverage
concealer and the master conceals like a
full pass coverage like heavy duty bitch
so I'm just gonna mix them both hit me
first pinch that in I'm
taking a very small amount as you can
see right there a very small amount of
the master conceal that glamoflage one
I'm gonna put that right closest to
where I have the dark circles in the
dark color put that right there just to
help really brighten and conceal okay so
let's go ahead and take real tonie's
Bruns brush and sponge combined is
brunch apparently in my mind
okay go so now we're going to take that
same Real Techniques sponge I'm going to
blend that in and really pounce those
bad boys together to make it look like a
nice custom coverage nice full coverage
still very brightening and really pretty
as you can see look how pretty that is
in which we are not looking like
affordable today we're gonna look
expensive after that you're gonna have
to pay a lot to rent us folk so now I'm
going to take the RCM a no colour powder
this one is not really found at the
drugstore but it's not very expensive
it's like 13 bucks it's a very very very
good inexpensive option for a great
powder to set the face I'm gonna use it
to bake underneath my eyes taking all
the real techniques sponge and just
pressing that in I'm really ensuring a
nice full coverage set oh honey you know
we are beautiful we're gonna bake like
our mother is Betty
Crocker you go ahead and bake wherever
the you want okay I'm just gonna
bake and the areas I like to be a little
bit more bright and the areas that
crease on me a ton okay I feel like a
little kid
Oh some so now for the rest of the
things I'm gonna take the Kodi airspun
powder this is found at most drugstores
is literally like five dollars it's
absolutely amazing I remember the person
I ever saw Cody Aerys when I was
watching a drag queen tutorial on
YouTube because I wanted to I had tried
to do drag before I got him to make up
guys just letting you know it's such a
random backstory I tried doing drag once
with some friends and I looked up drag
tutorials and it was just a it was not
cute
my look was not cute I'll try to find
photos and insert them but if I don't it
you're welcome because it's not gonna be
good so I put that now artiste brush and
just press that in all over the face
this powder smells like your grandma's
womb if just in case you guys are
wondering what this probably smells like
it's insane I like the laura mercier
translucent much more but if you're on a
budget and you want something that's
kind of similar and comparable the Cody
airspun will be fantastic so now that
I'm done pretty much cooking underneath
these eyes looking pretty soon I gosh
I'm going to take the Maybelline fit me
powder in the shade 110 it's like one of
their lightest shades and my dust that
underneath the eye so wipe off any of
the excess powder and it's just going to
help to wipe off everything as well as
kind of also brighten underneath my eyes
so this is a face powder that gives you
like a little bit of a face shine
bitch is struggling okay cool so now
that our face is pretty much set the one
thing I will say about the Cody are some
powder that I do not like is that it
gives you almost like a grayish cast so
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna grab the
L'Oreal infallible Pro matte powder in
the shade 300 which is the same shade
that I use for the liquid and on my
justice all over the face just to kind
of give me more of a skin light
appearance again to help dust off the
excess Cody airspun powder that's not
gonna make a big difference but it's
just more of a personal preference thing
you can just leave it as is with the
Cody I respond but I really do think
that it gives you a weird you a weird
hue that I just don't really like and
that's going on a morphe 2 which is what
the brush I love to use for bronzer
amazing dude we are full coverage right
Lisa's looking so be right now and this
is like affordable it okay now it's time
to take some bronzer and bronze up this
mug so we don't look so they think okay
we're gonna take you the Physicians
Formula butter bronzer I've heard
amazing things I'm not ready yet
I bought this recently no idea this is
not reason I bought this like months ago
and I still have not tried it I wanted
to try it in a video for the first time
so I'm just got the e to brush run it in
here oh my god yeah that just sounds
like a tropical oasis for real
okay we're gonna put that into the
bronzy areas of our face ah it's pretty
oh my gosh this is exciting I love it
one like things work that people say
they're gonna work you know I'm saying
it works like it's a bronzer man
it looks nice it's like and it's really
really neutral it's not too warm and
it's not too cool which I'm really
impressed with mmm this smells like
 it smells like pina colada mix
with some Tapatio mess with some
 tajin with some pepino up in that
bitch's mouth good okay so we're
pretty bronze up guys like we are bronzy
and this bronzer is not fully matte by
the way this is much more of a satin
like real-life bronzer if that makes any
sense it's a beautiful beautiful bronzer
though I have to admit it's pretty
freakin nice I'm gonna go just run that
same brush light used to UM highlight
the underneath in my eyes underneath the
bronzer just to clean it up a very
subtle amount nothing crazy that spot
right there strikes again oh hey
amazing so our face looks like so far
bronzed up check full coverage check
bitch stare check now for the blush I'm
gonna take
a little bit of the Milani baked blush
in the shade bellissimo bronze zero six
on a morphe for and I've done to a
little bit of that oh my god that looks
pigment as calm down I'm into a
nice light layer of that to really warm
up the skin you guys know I love orange
e peach blushes they're like literally
everything to me so that's what we're
doing
do these blushes are pigmented
holy Milani I have the that one
other one that's really really popular I
forgot what it's called but it's
beautiful it's stunning it's
like the really popular one what is it
called I don't remember I don't remember
full I don't remember I'm sorry
but I have that one and I use it
actually all the time I think so
beautiful this one is so pretty it
reminds him like a almost more glowy
version of my Becca wild honey bitch is
so I can be in late to the ground so now
for highlight I got my hands on the Wet
n Wild mega glow highlighting a powder
so I'm gonna be using that on my face
today to highlight this skin this is in
the shade that precious petals on a
morphe are 12 fan brush and I want to
put that on never tried these before
either I'm really excited honestly from
the drugstore this is beautiful
so as we can all see I have a pimple
right here hi pimple with aa minute like
hey Bruce just let you guys know it's
there I know it's there you don't need
to tell me or anything
I see the pimple I know it's there I
have texture I told you before I am a
 man okay so we're gonna put that
on the top points of our cheeks
it looks beautiful though mm-hmm
oh my gosh this is so pretty honestly
truly honestly truly I'm looking really
 summary when I'm doing this fall
tutorial right now
mmm I do much about it now again people
so for to set the face I'm going to take
the L'Oreal infallible makeup setting
spray this is the only setting spray
from the drugstore that I actually enjoy
anything it works pretty well
let's place on the face to help melt in
the powder everywhere I'll let that
settle in this be isn't is there the
betta there okay now we're gonna
move on it to the eyes okay so let's go
and do some brows on camera I usually do
the brows off of camera but I decided
that because I am doing more of a
drugstore look / affordable stuff imma
do the brows on camera at least one
maybe
Wow
the camera though I did contour my nose
a little bit with that same butter
bronzer guess my nose looks slightly
smaller or whatever the it looked
you could look bigger if you look
smaller I don't know
so now for the brow I'm going to be
taking V Loreal brow stylist definer
which looks basically like the little
Anasazi brow is adorable and we're gonna
be trying this out what sheet is this
shade of dark brunette so we're gonna be
creating our little brow shape just like
I normally would but any other brow
pencil bottom of the brow first hey this
is working pretty good pencil is
definitely pigment in so you can see
that I created that little bottom shape
the rest of my brow oh that's too long
honesty's not bad at all cuz not bad at
all to me how long does it last on the
brow so up today I have no idea I'm
willing doing this right now but I can
just say from right now the experience
that this goes on nicely pigmented it's
really really easy which I love and yeah
it's not too bad let's go and start on
the eyes now i unprimed on the eyes the
only thing I look guys not affordable in
this vid whole entire video is the
primer that I'm wearing on my eyes
it's the Smashbox 24 hour when it comes
to primer on the eyes that's like the
one thing I'll not forfeit for like a
lower-end one I just think that that one
is the best and I can't really stop
using it because I'm scared I won't use
another one that's always good you know
so I'm decided that today I want to do a
really cool purple focused look a
dramatic one
so I grabbed the morphe 35p palette
which is the 35 of purple palette this
is just going to be great because it has
literally every purple shade I
need ever and I want to focus everything
on the lid color which is the infallible
shadow by L'Oreal and smoldering plum so
we're gonna be doing something on but
let's go and start on with this eye I'm
gonna be taking this transition shade
right here it's like a nice basically
like Peach Smoothie looking transition
again this is on a more for a 27 and
we're gonna put that into the crease
very lightly and just press that in and
just art using little nice round
circular motions to blend everything
together similar transition shade you
guys I said this before about morphe
palette so I'll say it again
some of these shades are serious like
bingers like they're so absolutely
amazing especially for the price point
but some of them don't work as amazingly
as um some of the other ones do so just
I'm just letting you guys know that
that's some of them are phenomenal and
so
we're good and some of them are like
okay so just letting you guys know I
mean for honestly for a palette for like
what 25 bucks
hey whole full palette that works very
well 20 bucks that's pretty amazing to
me I think so if you're looking for a
nice palette and you look purple check
out the 35p because it works very well
and it does have every color that you
can possibly need as well as the nice
transitions that you want in a palette
or just if you want a transition in
general so now I'm gonna go in with the
more precise brush with the morphe e17
and that's gonna go more concentrated
into the crease
really you're just building that color
up add another transition right on top
of the nude shape can you see right
there it's beautiful it's a beautiful
color we're gonna take that out because
we are going to be pretty dramatic with
this look right above the crease there
is no denying the fact that morphe has a
good shadows like there's no denying it
I don't like people try talk about
morphe and say like it's Chucky bazoom
work at the end of the day you can
literally swatch it put it on your eyes
and you'll see that they work if you
know what you're doing they work no tea
no shade to all the talkers that
can't use morpheme shadows you need you
know how to make anything ism my guys
just going in with that you 27 and
blending out those shades okay cool so
we have a nice dusty pinkish purple
thing going on right now now let's go
and focus on much more brighter purple
and start to really build up that
intensity okay so now let's go in
or even go in with them you know there's
so many free booze I'm thinking we're
gonna go in with this shade and this
shade combine these two right here and
we're gonna go ahead and just start to
same thing and build up that purple into
the crease
you have a nice just like dusty rose
kinda thing going on but I really want
to make sure that we have this purple
moment going on because this look is
gonna be mostly purple this is a really
cool tone look for me it's a different
okay it's fine
we're without actually lower than the
other shades because this is gonna be a
gradient effect and blend out with the
e27
once more people so now I'm going to
take a thirty six brush my morphine I'm
going to take this really pretty moon
burgundy shade right here it's a little
darker it's a much more warmer maroon
brownish shade and up with that lowest
of all the colors and really start to
build that up as well because I'm going
to doing a really dark lid I feel so I'm
going to really make sure that it looks
intense all the way around it and it's
able to be blended easily into the next
shades going up so you can see I'm
building right here and I'm really just
looking up while doing this so I can see
exactly where I want to place the
product as you can see it's already
started
and darken up nicely same v17 blend out
those edges again in between each step I
take that u-17 and blend out one more
time and now for the fun part we're
going to go ahead and put on the lid
color I'm going to take the Maybelline a
24-hour tattoo crayon and this is a
lilac dust shade I'm gonna be going over
with the law really I don't want top
just to press it in I think this would
be a nice base color it is gonna be a
little bit lighter than the shadow we're
gonna go in with but I don't know I just
wanted I just saw and I thought it would
be nice for a base so I'm going to run
that crayon all over the lid wherever it
is exposed
I really have a nice pretty color down
that's beautiful and then I'm taking a
more 50:32 and blending out cream so
it's not as intense looking it's not so
like a line basically okay cool so now
let's go ahead and pry this L'Oreal
infallible shadow and the shade
smoldering plum this is a more of a dark
shade it's almost black with like purple
reflect in it I already take that on a
t30 to my morphe same brush that we just
used to blend out those edges and we're
just gonna pack that on right on top of
the base oh that's beautiful
and it's really just start to build
slowly and pat on so there's no major
fallout this smoky light is not playing
any games cause now we have the color
packed on exactly where we want it to
we're gonna go ahead and blend out the
edges of that color with that stain t36
you don't need to add any additional
product we're just going to blend out
that little harsh line there's no harsh
lines or any edges for this look we want
to look really seamless and blend it out
to perfection just keep on blending
until we got a good line or actually we
have no line are you so now I have the
tops of the eyes done this is basically
what I want to have it at I think they
look really really nice it's blended
very well I don't know if it looks
blended on I'm gonna go back in with our
wet and wild highlighting powder really
quickly the same one I used earlier on a
small morphe m32 6 I'm going to pack
that on the inner corner of my eye to
help brighten everything as you can see
it's beautiful it's a nice like
champagne shade and then also on the
brow bone of course highlighting the
brow bone whenever I do a smoky eye like
this what's more of an intense smoky eye
I really wanna make sure I'm
highlighting the top points of my eye
because it's really easy for I to look
so closed off you know I'm saying quickl
so this is what it looks like nice and
highlighted I'm starting to build up the
color on the lower
laughing like I did on the top something
that nice arose a pedal II shade right
here and we're going to put that on the
lower lash line
honestly if there's any of the darker
shades left on this brush it's all good
because you're really going to be
building up darker shades anyway so
honesty doesn't really matter so now
going back in with that vibrant purple
shade right there I'm going to be taking
that money morphe 43 really start to
build up the intensity on the lower lash
line and make that really cool purple
pot this look is fantastic if you have
green eyes blue eyes any kind of colored
eyes even brown eyes this is such a
pretty look and it's going to really
complement so many different kind of eye
colors I just love it so much so to run
that really bright purple all the way in
right Tori put the highlight because it
is gonna be smoking all the way around
now to really make sure everything's
intense and smokey still we're going to
take that darkest shade right here I'm
going to put that closest to the lash
line I really start to define the lower
lash line really well the make sure it's
really close to the lash line really
pushing that in because of course
closest to lash line at the top is
really dark as well and we're going to
go and blend out with that you 36 make
sure it doesn't look too harsh okay so
now we have that down I'm gonna go ahead
and line the waterline with this pencil
by Maybelline is to the Maybelline New
York lasting a drama waterproof gel
pencil in the shade polished em amethyst
what the and the shade of Polish
amethyst yeah so I'm go ahead and put
that on my waterline and just go ahead
and brighten everything up because this
is very bright intense looking purple I
think I'm eternity a let's try it oh I
just feel like because we are doing a
purple look I wanted to keep it in that
purple family that's pretty that's
really pretty because I now I'm gonna
apply some mascara never try this one
before this is the new Maybelline the
falsies push-up angel then Jenna
oh this is very confusing this little
wand to this okay well
we're gonna try it out hmm okay mm-hmm
coat those lashes okay honestly I'm not
mad at this mascara at all it works
pretty freakin well I have really bad
gnocchi's guys by the way I have lashes
that point straight down they're short
it's just not a cute look but this one I
feel like because this the one is so
tiny it really did help separate my
lashes and push them upwards and notice
a difference for real guys you it was
not only the mascara on
apply some falsies I've grabbed from I
lower the biggest nail ashes I got these
at Ulta and I figured I was gonna do a
lash it's not as expensive as a lashes I
usually wear I always wear like mink
lashes that are just a nice intense
wispy pair but this is a great lash for
not too much of thing was like seven
bucks and so we're gonna apply this lash
on Terry's eyes and that is it for the
final I look this is what they look like
what the lashes on Clinton's now that we
have the face and the eyes completed I'm
gonna go ahead and do the lips real
quick and of course we're gonna be
taking a more affordable option lipstick
as well so because my eye is really
purple it's literally just you know it's
purple right away I was gonna go with
the neutral and just keep it nude and
move on but I really want to switch up
the look and kind of come out of my
comfort zone a little bit and put a more
dark nude on the lips so what I decide
to go with is kathleenlights is a point
zero lipstick ultra satin lip with Clare
pop I've run this before and I love it
so much it's a beautiful shade I think
with this look going on it's neutral
enough to work but it's still like not a
nude as much if that makes any sense so
we go ahead and apply this on the lips
I'm so cool tone - it's like the coolest
I've ever been and this is the final
look and that is it you guys that is it
for the entire video I hope you guys
enjoyed this fun dramatic fall and
makeup tutorial and I know this is like
a fall look that's much more on the cool
tones side I will be of course doing
more fall looks that are more warm tone
and more just different tones if you
guys have any ideas of what you guys
would like me to do with a look you guys
want to see more of a burgundy tutorial
or like a more orange eat tutorial or
even olive green whatever colors you
