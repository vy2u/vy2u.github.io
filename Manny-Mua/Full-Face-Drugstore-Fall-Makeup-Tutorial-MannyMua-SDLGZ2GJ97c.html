today's video is going to be a tutorial
on this okay going on right now it's a
full face tutorial and today's look is a
little bit special because the entire
thing is drugstore from the foundation
primer
everything is drugstore on my face so
I'm so excited to be doing this video
I've been getting so many requests from
people to do like drugstore stuff and
include trucks store items more into my
tutorials and I'm so sorry that I
haven't been like doing it a lot people
know this but a lot people don't
I started makeup at Sephora so two years
ago I started working at Sephora and
now's my first experiences with makeup
so I never had the like luxury of trying
and testing up makeup at the drugstore
and right after Sephora I went straight
into Mac and so right after Mac I went
into YouTube so I never really had the
luxury of trying out different like
drugstore products throughout my life so
I'm sorry if I don't really use
drugstore as much for some reason it
kind of like scares me I don't I just
kind of steer clear from drugstore but
I'm really try to push myself to do more
drugstore stuff for you guys because I
know you guys are like requesting it and
I'm like trying my best to do it for you
guys so I hope you guys enjoy this look
this is a very like grungy very fall I'm
just so ready for fall like to come and
like I just like this is my first fall
tutorial I'm super excited um I think it
came out really beautifully and I'm
really happy with the results especially
this is all drugstore and I'm like my
followers don't have a mouth dance I'm
working to get towards that drugstore
life you feel me

anyone's new hi hello welcome to my
little maniac family and my little mini
a community that for the do let's go and
get into this video it's a full face
video so it's gonna be pretty long I
feel it in my bones it's gonna be long
so yeah I'll talk you guys later back
okay cool so let's go and just get this
bad boy started I'm starting with
nothing on my face I have moisturizer on
but that's about it I want to do like
the full face full blown everything
today I'm really excited it's gonna be
full face drugstore and I have not like
used a lot of these parts I already went
out and bought like $100 worth of makeup
and I'm like let's hope for the best
okay
obviously first I want to prime the face
I'm gonna go ahead and use the laurio
magic Lumi primer I'm gonna be going
with a mattifying foundation and a
powder so I figured might as well like
kind of be like a little bit glowy
underneath all the madness
the mat you know I'm saying some Justin
kind of go in and prime the face with
this I've heard really great things
about this that it's really brightening
and it's really nice to prime the face
especially if you're going in with the
matte foundation because you're really
nice like luminous like a live glow
perfect we're primed and we're ready
so go her foundation I'm gonna go ahead
and use my favorite like drugstore
foundation that I found so far it is the
Loreal Pro matte infallible I'm obsessed
with this foundation I think it's
absolutely amazing it's like freaking
medium to full coverage it's a
mattifying it lasts all day it's just
fucking Bombeck my hand I'm gonna go on
with a damp Beauty Blender I would use
my Real Techniques ones but like I lost
my Real Techniques sponge start pressing
that in I'm in the shade 103 I don't
really think this is actually my color
but 102 is a little bit too pink and
it's just like the coloring with the pro
matte I think is just so off so we're
gonna use the 103 I know I don't ever do
like drugstore stuff but I'm gonna be
looking like fucking B I'm gonna be
looking like I'm fuckin Chanel we're not
gonna be looking like we're drug so
we're gonna be looking like we're
fucking shun now definitely blend it
down the neck because this is not really
my color okay perfect so we are now
foundation so I went out and bought some
concealers shit I'm gonna be using the
master conceal by Maybelline I've heard
really amazing things about this one and
I heard that it's like really good so
I'm gonna go ahead and put that like
right here not a lot of it because I
heard it's like intense coverage like
enhance oh fucking I'm an intense bitch
to a good low blog okay so much gonna go
in with my finger oh I like I like I
like
easyread butter blend it out oh my god
I'm so impressed what the fuck and then
I'm gonna go over top of it with the
magic lumi from l'oreal which is like a
little like highlighting pen basically
it's like the mac prep and prime which I
always use so I'm gonna just go over it
like like that
and it should look like this it's nice
and concealed and Brian oh my god what
the hell this looks really cool it looks
really cool looks really good
okay I want to see like half the stuff
I'm using is because of Kathleen's like
recommendations on her videos so I'm
just like going off Kathleen right now
I'm gonna go and use the Maybelline fit
me it's Maybelline fit me powder and 110
and I'm just gonna use that to set my
under eye area this powder is really
nice because has like kind of like a
sheen to it so I'm just gonna use that
and I'm just gonna set my under eye with
it just give me more of a brightening
effect and I'm using a more feet in four
three eight I use this all the time
talks really pretty oh my gosh yes bitch
yawn oh oh my god I really like how it
looks underneath I like holy crap
I like it okay so dimers gonna go in I'm
high like the rest of the face I'm gonna
take the Maybelline master conceal again
in master conceal I'm in the shade light
the magic Lumi I'm in the shade light as
well because I wanted to use them like
to be a high lady so I'm gonna take a
little bit on here a little bit on my
forehead whatever's on the cap on my
little Cupid's bow and I'm take my same
key butter and press that and tell
brighten my face why am I so impressed
with this concealer I know I can handle
it
perfect or a little more bright should I
go to my nose tone because you know I
know it's kind of fuckin be oh fuck
blend it out while you can
perfect so we are good to go on the
concealing side I'm gonna set my face
now I'm gonna take the Maybelline fit me
the matte and poreless fit me I'm gonna
take a morphe 2 brush I'm just going to
press that onto my face with the e 2
brush till mess 113 I think right and
now I'm in the shade 130 with the matte
and poreless honestly reminds me like
Studio Fix powder by Mac it's like a
frickin intense powder but it's like
good it's a good intense I feel like my
face looks pretty beat right now like in
the best way possible so now for the
bronzer and the face I'm like a
highlighter and shit I'm gonna go and
take this NYX
on-the-go palette it looks like this I'm
gonna be taking the shade over here the
bronzing shade and I'm gonna put that on
my bronzing Ariel's cool cool so I'm
gonna take the Tarte brush like this
Tarte like flat angled brush I'm gonna
dip into you need to be careful with
this fucking powder because it is so
powdery like super powdery so you need
to watch out for that and I'm gonna use
that to like kind of carve out and
bronze up my face
this brush reminds me of the NARS eat a
brush but like a much better version of
it I'm not really the biggest fan of the
NARS either brush I feel like the
bristles are way too tough and I don't
like it whatsoever so the fact that
talking about something like this I'm
like yes bitch like yes bitch like yes
bitch and the bristles are so soft like
like a
winds up so nice he like look at that
like bitches blended to fill go and do
that to temples as well okay great so we
are bronzed now I feel like the bronzer
looks really actually it looks really
freakin pretty the bronzer is more on
the warm side it's definitely more of a
warm bronzer it's not so cool toned but
I think it looks really really pretty
and I'm not gonna like contour any ducks
I feel like it did the job for me even
though it's a little more on the warm
side I still liked how it looks
come on yes bitch now I'm gonna
highlight so I'm gonna go and take this
shade right here so I'm gonna take that
on a morphe M 510 and I highlight the
face look how pretty that is it's like a
nice champagne gold highlighter it's so
powdery like wanna see like oh you can
see but like powder is like falling down
but honestly like I think it's so nice
and it's like totally worth it
that shit fucking glowing inside perfect
so I'm glowing and gorgeous and gotta
see I'm gonna take the Milani blush and
Luminoso nikkietutorials is one that
like really like push this into my room
oh it's not first comes out what the
fuck but nikkietutorials is one that
like really pushed that into my mind cuz
she uses luminoso all the time and I'm
like you know what let me try it by
Milani so I'm gonna go in with the
morphe III brush I'm just gonna brush
this onto my cheeks kind of blending the
highlighter and bronzer together with
the blush it's really really pretty it's
much more of a natural blush cool so the
face is basically done I think the face
turned out really freakin nice like I'm
really honestly like very much impressed
like I'm happy I am fucking happy with
this face right now I'm happy with a mug
like the mug is be for filth and ready
to go so it's gonna start on the brows
hmm I'm gonna going to take the same
Maybelline master conceal on a more feet
and four to one and I'm going to carve
out the brow as well as prime the lid
I'm just gonna use a concealer has
primer if you guys know of any good like
drugstore primers like for the eyes that
are good like let me know because I
would love to try them out carve out the
brow with a concealer when I fill in my
brows I only ever use brow gel so this
is why I like for me like carving out my
brows concealer is really important
because I needed to look like I have
much more shape than I really do you
know what I mean so I'm just gonna kind
of press that in and I'm gonna take that
concealer the rest of it on my finger
and then I'm just going to prime my lids
with the concealer it should look
something like this this I is much more
like covered in primed and this one's
like basically so I've done look at that
eye with no additional product I'm just
gonna kind of press over the concealer
to set the concealer in place I saw a
residual powder on here from the fit me
and now I'm really excited about this I
finally found the brow stylist plumper
by
Lauria laughs he were telling you about
this brow gel I told you guys I wanted
to use brow gel on my brows from the
drugstore and that I heard this was
really great so I grabbed it in the
shade medium and dark so I'm just go
ahead and put this brow gel through my
brows and hopefully that looks pretty
sweet
ooh I love it I'm so impressed
I'm so happy like I'm really happy about
this tutorial right now so far hope you
guys are liking it too I'm just like the
difference is so real it's really real
the brows are on and I am very very
pleased with them very pleased who's
text me so first things first I'm gonna
go in with the NYX shadow like the
single shadow in suede which looks like
this medium toned Brown and I'm gonna go
in with a morphe 27 not just gonna go
into our crease as our transition color
that's not too warm not too cool I'm
just putting that in with the morphe 27
brush honestly though like this look is
gonna be kind of grungy so you don't
need it even like worried about being
too messy like the whole point of it is
to be kind of messy with this look it's
gonna be very like yeah like grunge like
so you know and then gonna go in back
with that on the go pally I don't take
that bronzer color and that I'm gonna
take a little bit lower in the crease
just give me more dimension and I'm just
kind of running it in with that morphe
in 4-3-3 just to give me more depth I'm
taking that color all the way in to the
inner corner in my lower crease area so
just kind of running that back and forth
honestly like pretty impressed with the
way the NYX shadows blend think they
blend pretty nicely I thought I'm
shocked because like NYX I feel like
it's a savior when it comes to drugstore
products now I'm gonna take the NYX Trey
Jolie liner in brown it's like the brown
one it's like a gel liner it's really
cool like these are really nice I'm
gonna run that all over the lid we're
not all over the lid I'm taking it
really close to the lash line and a
little bit on the lid and I'm taking a
really stiff brush the more 5032 and I'm
gonna blend that out before it sets too
quickly I like to blend down when I'm
blending a Joe I just like to go
downwards and downward motions because I
feel like it blends the top of it down a
lot easier honestly this part does not
need to be nee whatsoever because we're
going in with the shadow on top of it
anyway and then for the star of the lid
let's drop the lid I'm gonna be going in
with the NYX like these shadows like I
remember what these are called but like
though the intense ones I'm gonna be
going out to shade a bedroom is it which
is like a DP bronzy copper I'll show you
guys that's like that and that I'm gonna
take on my finger I'm just gonna place
that literally on top of the brown
shadow yeah
and I'm taking that slightly past where
the brown ends okay so as you can see
like the brown base from the Trey Jolie
liner and
like right there but I took it slightly
above that I like the shadow so much
it's like a really deep copper and now
I'm gonna go back in with that bronzer
color again and I'm just gonna kind of
blend that in with the previous colors I
just want to really blend it with that
bedroom eyes color I don't want to look
too harsh it looks so grungy I love it
and then with no additional product on
my e27 I'm just kind of blend out those
edges even more perfect so this is what
it should look like it looks like a nice
grungy metallicky lid I think it looks
super cool super like fallish I'm gonna
take this shade and this shade I'm just
gonna mix them on my tiny little baby
morphe m32 6 and that's gonna go on the
inner corner and the brow bone as my
highlight it's really intense and bright
I love it I mean I know we're going kind
of grungy with this lip but I still want
to be glam as that you know I'm laying
and then I'm gonna put that on the brow
bone as the highest point of the brow
bone I never ever put frosty shades on
my brow bone like it's one of my things
I don't do like it's not my thing this
color and like the way it looks with
this look looks really pretty and that's
at the top of the lid should look like
on this eye cool so I'm gonna go into
the other eye off camera real quick and
I'll be right back okay perfect so now
we have both of the eyes done at least
the top of the eyes done for the bottom
of the eye where take that same Trey
Jolie liner this is gonna be kind of
smoky I've decided I'm gonna take that
underneath the eye like on the rim of my
hi I'm just run that bitch in I'm also
gonna take a little bit underneath my
eye and then I'm gonna blend that out
with a morphe M 508 which is like a
little like tiny little brush like that
and just kind of blend that out like we
did on the top I mean it is a gel so
it's gonna blend up pretty nicely but
you need to just work quick with it and
we are blended I'm gonna go and take
that same on-the-go palette this cute
little one right here I'm gonna take
that bronzer shade again run that
underneath to blend it out even more
just gonna give me some dimension I
don't want to look so start with a gel
liner a grungy look that's well done is
a blended look and now for some extra
little wow factor might as well I mean
we're already here I'm gonna take that
same shadow bedroom eyes I'm gonna take
a little bit on the front part of
underneath eye on the same morphe M 508
I'm just gonna press that right after
the highlight inner corner highlight
just gonna press that in like that the
pencil brush I was using to blend out
everything by the way it was the e36 buy
more feet of course super grungy super
messy but like there's order those order
in this messy system you feel me now I'm
gonna go in with mascara and some lashes
I'm gonna take the L'Oreal telescopic
carbon black I literally had a text
Kathleen in on my Kathleen what's a good
luck charm mascara that you think is
bomb so I grabbed this one she said this
was great for her
I'm gonna use this little bad boy for my
lashes today I'm gonna coat my lashes
with some mascara I'm gonna be using
falsies anyways so I mean it's not that
big of a deal I like my roller lash more
from benefit I like that mascara like
the most I think it's pretty good and
don't forget to put some on the bottom
as well you guys know the drill uh-huh
you won't like it for the bottom a lot
actually
okay so I'm going with House of lashes
lashes in the style boudoir there are
you had bucks they look like this I'm
gonna be using my Revlon precision lash
glue which is so good I love this lash
glue like fucking hella one lash down
once ago guys are done I'm so happy that
they're done finally oh my god I thought
they took me forever the lashes are
really nice I think they're not too
expensive either like seven bucks
awesome so the eyes are done and now
we're gonna finish the lips and we'll be
done with this look I'm so sorry for the
lip right now I tweeted that I was like
you guys want to see me do a bold lip or
you guys wanna see me do like a natural
lip with this like kind of grungy fall
look and a bunch of guys said like do a
bold lip and I was like you know okay
cool I'm gonna do a bold lip so for the
bold lip I decided to do I'm gonna go in
with NYX lip liner in hot cocoa
which is like a deep brownish lip liner
I'm gonna go ahead and fill in the
entire lip with this lip liner because I
wanted to like crayon jeopardy purposes
and for some more dips in this lip for
the lipstick I'm so excited to go in
with this I'm gonna be going in with the
Maybelline Color sensational collision
station lipstick with the color burgundy
blush which is like a deep burgundy i
swatched in the store because it was
like one already open and it was
gorgeous so that I'm gonna put all over
the entire lid I smell so good this
formula is so nice like it's so nice and
that's it for the lip look basically the
look is entirely done now to finish it
off I'm gonna go ahead and spray the
L'Oreal throw spray and set by Laura hi
Sanne I never tried this before so let's
try it out right now feels promising
don't make me look oily or maybe Dom
don't try me I know this look is so
intent and so bold and so like I'm so
falling grungy but I think it looks so
freakin pretty I like the bold lip and I
like the bold I think that if you like
the way it looks do it do your thing and
that's all that really matters and yeah
