already and if you knew what's up and
menu on you a and welcome to my channel
so let's get into this drugstore makeup
look
so let's go ahead and get into this full
face get ready with me a drugstore
Edition I'm so excited I'm done a
drugstore video and so freaking long and
I have so many people that always
requests me to do more drugstore things
so take to get ready drugstore Edition a
Valerio all this drugstore probably
front of me so that's we're gonna be
using two day I'm gonna go in with first
the L'Oreal magic Lumi primer this is
just a really good illuminating primer
it does give you a nice luminous finish
to your foundation and I just noticed
that I'm doing more of a mattifying
foundation like the t-zone even with
this primer I'm good to go throughout
the day so I'll be pretty good
perfection so I'm gonna go in with the
Maybelline matte and poreless foundation
in the shade 120 and that's gonna be my
t-zone foundation a dollop of it and I'm
having something else on the rest of the
face just because I have extra drugstore
foundations I want to use them all and
honestly like for me I don't know what
it is about me but I don't like to do
just one foundation on the face like I
always didn't like such a mix freak with
all nations because I figured you know
if you like one foundation for one thing
why not use another foundation for
something else that you like in a
different area so that's what I like to
do so I can see the t-zone is completely
covered with that foundation and so now
for the rest of the face I'm going to go
in with the L'Oreal True Match Lumi
cushion foundation which is such a good
ass foundation it's absolutely stunning
it just gives you such a beautiful like
luminous like lifelike glow to the skin
and it took a nice coverage like medium
coverage very buildable it's just
awesome so I doesn't suggest this one so
save your more on the dry side too
this is a great one I'm gonna go with my
morphe m43 9 and literally just kind of
soaked her up and I'm just gonna go in
and start buffing this foundation all
over the skin and I'm also taking you
down the neck as well I don't like doing
this
o whatsoever I'm taking a liquid on the
neck hate it but just for the purpose of
matching and not having to use another
powder I'm just gonna take it down the
neck for today yeah that ain't
ready
so for concealer I'm gonna take the
Maybelline master conceal this is such a
good concealer it's like freakishly
Bahama I'm obsessed with it to be honest
I'm SHINee's a little bit of that on the
I might use this little Real Techniques
sponge to blend it oh and I'm using a
real techniques sponge just for like
this take up being like drugstore you
know so cool so I'm pretty
ceil it's such a creamy full-coverage
concealer if I can recommend you
consider from the drugstore that nice
and full coverage creamy and it really
does cover like what you need to get
covered a Maybelline master conceal
freakishly bomb and now for the sake of
being brighter I'm going to take the
L'Oreal magic Lumi pen which is like
another let's take a highlighting little
pet I really do love this pendous works
really really nicely just so I kind of
illuminate a little bit more I really
want to do the 5 minute makeup challenge
I've been seeing tons of people do it
recently I feel like Jeffrey and Nicki
kind of like started a trend up again
just because I've been seeing it all
over the place a little bit more and I
just gotta be so fun to do you know what
I mean sighs have any suggestions of any
other youtubers that you would like to
see me do the 5 minute makeup challenge
with let a bitch know in the comment
board below because that IRA
arrived but I think that'd be really
really really fun you know what I mean
so let me know who you guys would want
to see me do that with and I think
that'd be just such a fun that's a video
I've never tried to do a makeup in five
minutes I don't know man I feel like I
would actually really did terribly but
you never know and I won't I won't
practice or anything I'll be good until
I actually have to do it once that's all
blended out nicely I'm gonna take the
Maybelline fit me powder in the shade
110 which is that the porcelain task
shade just to set the under-eye powder
this is such a nice finely milled powder
and I remember you seen caffeine doing
this once and I was like I want to try
that and so I tried it on my first
drugstore video and it turned out so
nicely and I was like what on my morphe
48 amazing little pointed setting brush
so good and for the rest of the face I'm
gonna take this Big Daddy brush the e-40
one and labeling fit me matte and
poreless powder because I have two met I
just had two of them the freakin bomb I
wanted if you buy it in something you
know what these are freaking bomb these
powders are super super good their money
goes to fix powder by Mac but like a
cheaper drugstore version of them I just
really like them this is the shade 130
and I'm going to run that all over the
face just to set the rest of the face
lightly nothing too heavy just to give
me a little bit more coverage as well as
set the face for the rest of the day so
I never tried this product I really want
to try it today on camera this is the
Maybelline master contour palette co
cute this is it's like a nice like
contour color blush highlighter dodo
dodo in here Nasseri thing and I'm gonna
take this on a morphe - the contour
color and start bronzing up the skin oh
my god
what color is just gonna be a nerve
you know what if works it works
it does what you needed to do we needed
to bronze up the skin and it bronzed up
the skin back it looks a little pinky
like I'll agree feel like the bronze
looks a little pink yeah just like it
was a little pinky but you know what
we're gonna go with it do you want
school about these powders oh is that
they're actually very very pigmented
like it really has good ass pigmentation
for sure also I'm using it in the shade
medium there's any suggestions for any
good drugstore bronzers I would be
really really cool if you guys can
suggest me some that are high quality
like good good drugstore bronzers that
are not patchy they're pigmented they're
nice and good drugstore bronzers I would
really really love for guys to suggest
me some because I don't have a single
joke sponsor not one not a single Joker
bronzer and I'm like okay I'll just
depending on this little master palette
to get me through it but it's not
working out do it it's not really like
my clothes I usually like to go in with
bronzer or whatever but we're gonna make
it work because I am what unspookable
bitch you can't clock me thank you again
but yeah so we're gonna go in with the
little blushes well might as well like
the blushes here once I got on III just
kind of dust a little bit this is looks
really pigmented so be careful I just
want to do a nice light flush oven
nothing to him it's a nice like matte
pink blush just a nice pretty color mmm
thank you
and because it's also there we're gonna
go in with a little highlighter as well
this is the highlight number three color
and I'm gonna take down a more freedom
310 fan brush just to highlight the skin
she's here let's do it
I've even tried this highlighter yet I'm
trying the palette yet this is actually
a really pretty
glowy color oh it's nice oh yeah that is
that that works for me
oh hi cool so we basically have the face
completely done now this is what I'm
gonna keep it at I don't really have any
more like contouring colors to contour
my nose because I don't want it to turn
up weird so this is what we're
gonna keep it to the base at I like I
turned out I feel like this face looks
nice it's clean it looks pretty so we're
gonna get you on to the eyes now first
things first we're going with the brows
because the brows are pretty barren
right now I have to brow products that
I've actually been using for a while now
I think they're gonna mesh well together
for this look I just want to show you
guys what they are I've been using the
Maybelline brow drama crayon because I
do have brows so I don't really need to
do
a lot of things I just kind of fill them
in and go and the Loreal brow stylist
plumper which is such a good brow gel
it's seriously amazing
so how I use the Maybelline thing I
literally just right through my brow
like this on the area's I have more
sparseness this is in the shade I don't
know
I dunno it's a darkest one and we're
just gonna push that through the brow
anyone have any sparseness as you can
see like alright just looks a lot more
filled not as far so that's kind of what
I'm doing I'm just running through with
this nice big ol crayon I'm just gonna
run i quick spleef through my brows oh
because it is pretty harsh and then the
Loreal brow stylist plumper it's gonna
run that little brow job there this is a
really good freaking brow gel for the
from the drugstore it's honestly like
impressive like I was genuinely
impressed when I first tried this I was
like ding okay and you give a little bit
of color
excuse me L'Oreal excuse the me
bitch and then shouldn't clean them up
with a little bit of concealer
underneath them to give them more of a
sharper appearance and that's it for the
brow so I just found my Milani Luminoso
blush really quickly let me just apply
that because that's like my favorite
drugstore blush of all time cuz just
such a mmm is so beautiful it's stupid
so now I'm going to with the eyes I by
the way are primed the eyes off of
camera I use the Maybelline master
conceal eyes primer to also clean up the
brows as well just so I can have a base
down first things first with the eyes
I'm gonna go in with the NYX single
shadow in the shade suede I use this in
my first joke so tutorial I believe just
a nice neutral transition shade on a
more 5027 and I just didn't go into the
crease just gonna have a biggest color
down first I'm Nydia what I want to do
with the eyes I don't want to be like
the everyday average I still wanted to
be slightly more dramatic so this is a
nice really neutral buildable maple
brown and I love it the battery got full
so I drop a computer and transfer
so that is why the computer is on and
now I'm gonna go in with my favorite
favorite drugstore eyeshadow formula of
all time it is the L'Oreal infallible
shadows after I tried the amber rush
color and I did my last tutorial I went
out and bought three of them because I
was like you gotta be joking me because
they're so good so now I'm going today
with the shade bronze taupe such a
beautiful creamy buttery consistency
it's literally like a foiled shadow from
the drugstore it's
haha I don't know how L'Oreal did it
it's just such a beautiful consistency
and that's gonna go on top of my lid
just put this nice bronzy taupe color on
the lid with your finger suck come on
come on and I'm shaking this little
clean morphe brush which is the e 28
letting out the edges so there's no hard
lines how do you mean oh I want to do
like I just like feel like I'm in like
this weird like I just wanna do
everything great so now we have this ice
just tobe top of the eye part I'm gonna
go in with this NYX white liquid liner I
just kind of wanted to try doing more of
a cool different liner I want this look
to be different I feel like I've been
kind of in or not enough fun but I feel
like I've been really into like pinks
and neutrals recently so I just want to
kind of jump out of my comfort zone and
do something that's more fun and so I'm
gonna go with this white liquid liner
and create a wing with it
and fill it in so now we have the white
eyeliner on I feel like it looks a
little bit weird like a little kind of
like a naked mole rat but it's because
you have Y eyeliner on and you're not
emphasizing it I just yet so once I put
lashes on it'll be so much better so the
liquid liner by NYX you definitely need
to like pile that one on to do like two
to three layers because it's not when it
dries it's not as pigmented as it first
goes on so you need to be aware of that
and it kind of cracks a little bit as
well so just be aware that but in turn I
think turned out really nicely
honestly I kinda want to something more
bold look on the lower lash line so I'm
going to take the next pop pop palette
this like chartreuse color and this is
mint color is kind of speaking to me so
I really want to use those and
incorporate them into this look somehow
so I'm gonna be taking first lis this
shade right here on a just big fluffy
brush this is an 18 by morphine that's
gonna go into lower lash line on the
outside there's add a pop of color ooh I
like this though it's pretty so I don't
go on with this like really bright
chartreuse color on the inner third of
the eye
just to give it more of a bright like
ombre effect and to let go look pretty
cool so now I'm take the NYX Trey Jolie
liner in the shade black and I put that
on the waterline usually I do more
bright clothes I guess I like to
emphasize my lower lash line with a
black eyeliner I don't want my eyes to
get lost in like the white eyeliner or
the color so that's kind of what I'm
doing okay like this so far I'm dead
again now take on that when you're doing
the white eyeliner I feel like it's very
very very important to put on lashes
because you want to really define the
lash line because it's gonna look kind
of like kind of crazy I feel punished
probably my real lashes for some falsies
later on so for mascara I'm gonna be
taking the Maybelline lash sensational
mascara I've heard really really really
great things about this one so I went
out and bought it and it kind of reminds
me of the roller lash benefit like
applicator it looks looks similar to
that apply that on the lashes so we have
the mascara on now I'm not really sure
if I like this one for the bottom lashes
I feel like I was only do too much for
me down there if you guys have any
suggestions for a really good bottom
lash line mascara from the drugstore let
a bitch know down there so now I'm gonna
go on with the lashes I'm gonna take the
lashes Serengeti my New Balance I'm not
just gonna give me a nice flared out
look and this is what you should have so
far now tell me doesn't it with lashes
look so much more natural and like it
goes so much better together that's I'm
saying I'm telling you guys the lashes
really make a huge difference or at
least emphasizing your own natural
lashes when you're doing white liner
- liking it lost really really easily
and your whole eyes in general can just
get lost
so with wearing lashes it's a really
really important part about this look
this is what the low turnout to be and I
think it turns out awesome huh
big lighten zoom you guys in to see what
that looks like up clip so let me have
that face and we have the eyes done
let's go ahead and finish off with the
lipping so if the lips I'm gonna be
taking the NYX peekaboo neutral lip
liner this is literally ah it's
embarrassing how much I've used this
it's embarrassing if you guys have
followed me since like the og days back
in the day you guys know Nick's peekaboo
a neutral lip liner I still use it like
every day it's just such a pretty
neutral baby pink lip liner that works
so well with any new lipstick or any
nude anything I just love it perfect so
we are lip lined to perfection so now
let's go in with a lipstick I honestly
don't even know what looks like I want
to go into it do I want to more go more
peach do I want to go I don't it's so I
really got a bunch of the Kate lipsticks
by Rimmel London and I literally love
this formula so much such a creamy
beautiful consistency it's not like
super opaque where it's like BAM like
crazy pigment right away it's just a
really pretty creamy formula that I mean
it does a lot of color to it but it's
not like a mattifying lipstick
whatsoever it's a cream so this is the
shade 42 and I've been wearing this like
crazy this month look at that look at
that and they smell so good like I don't
even know what they smell just well good
to me and this is the final look
and that is it for the entire video I
hope you guys enjoyed this video today I
had so much fun cream this for you guys
it's usually always so different when
I'm trying to do like a full face of
drugs or a full face like one brand
tutorial for examples I'm always like
okay these are my normal they don't know
my normal
so I neither like really like make a
bitch hustle you know I didn't because
it's not what I'm usually used to so
hope you guys enjoyed this video I'm
gonna try to do more drug sort and
incorporating more drugstore into my
everyday routine as well as for you guys
because I know like not everyone has the
freaking money to spend on Sephora
