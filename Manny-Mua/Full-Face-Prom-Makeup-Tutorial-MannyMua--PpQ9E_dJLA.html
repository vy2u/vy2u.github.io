so today's video is going to be one of
my most requested videos I've ever had
in a video ever like you guys requested
this look in my haul video my most
recent video so much I can't thing I've
ever gotten requests into for a video so
much in my whole life in a makeup so I
figured I would do it for you guys
because you guys were like please do it
bitch do it I don't think I've ever done
a problem look so I figured you know
what let's do a prom look let's make it
prom me because I feel like this is a
very pretty appropriate kind of prom
look you know that's I'm feeling I've
been on that out of you're feeling that
but I'll get on that
I think it's prami prom so if you guys
don't like this kind of video feel like
watching a boy put on makeup don't
fucking watch it what if you do
something grab the mantle it's funny
because this look has a story to it I
upload the video and then Jacqueline
texted me and she was like what are you
wearing on your eyes tell me right now
like so I like listed the profits that i
use and she's like oh so my everyday
look cool and i was like really like
sure every day look she's like no Manny
like how do you understand like I wear
that look almost every single day and
she sent me photos of her in this exact
look she's like not only is it the same
look we were waiting the same exact
shadows like this like that is me on
your eyes it to me and I'm like oh my
god it's neato this is me so I just
think it's funny because me and
Jacqueline like we have a very similar
aesthetic and we love both love like
that warm tone like to the eyes and
things like that so it's all super super
super funny was you text me that I'm so
shocked that you're watching this shout
out to you for thanks to me we have the
same exact I look on oh so say besides
this gets to the tutorial this problem
beautiful problem yeah bye you guys I'll
talk to you soon let's go ahead and
start this bad boy with the clean face I
just showered wash my face and
moisturized so she's clean for now next
image we're going to go ahead and go in
with the makeup forever step 1
equalizers I've been loving these
bitches lately so we're going to do that
I'm actually going with two I'm going to
use the base mattifying for the t-zone
the reason I'm using it for the t's
don't specifically and not like everyone
I face is because this bitch when it
says mattifying bhai Garces I mean funny
like this thing dried my fucking areas
that I needed to be dry like it was
disgustingly crazy so I'm just going to
put it in the
t-zone the areas I usually get oily okay
I swear like as soon as I put it on like
even now by a moisture like a zone then
I'm going to go in with a step one base
smoothing all over the rest of my face
just because I do want to have primer
throughout the rest of my face and this
one is really great for kind of texture
and things like that so for foundation
what I'm going to go in with is the
Estee Lauder Double Wear this is like my
tried and true foundation this one
drives with Demi matte finish it stays
on my face all day because any like full
coverage I love this foundation I'm
gonna show you one W two sand and I'm
going to use it with a damp Beauty
Blender over this fucking table right
here narco class shit though huge so now
I'm gonna go on with our demo blender
and just really press the foundation in
all over the face there we go we're nice
and full coverage yeah we are full color
calm then I'm going to go ahead and grab
the Mac Pro Longwear concealer in nw20
or gonna put that on the under eye areas
this one's brand new something you're
like come on bitch come out and I love
this concealer it's beautiful
not only is it gonna highlight me it's
gonna really help cover the darkness I
have underneath my eyes now that I have
about the shit-ton I know how much it
does like darkness but she does have
some so I'm showing you that Beauty
Blender to really help blend it out more
I look like a little girl but it's fine
it'll all come together together now
we're gonna go in with the Smashbox
contouring thing but I did in my haul
video a lot of people were like oh my
god you have to use a contour sticks in
that video so I was like do my thing I'm
gonna the line for anyone use the
highlighting one for the under eye area
the shitty thing about the highlight one
is that I feel like it doesn't highlight
me enough like I just don't feel like
that's a lot of highlight you know but
you know it's still beautiful it still
highlights
it just doesn't highlight as much as I
wish it did but that on the forehead is
well t-zone and then we're gonna blend
that out with the V butter as well again
these quadriceps are so blendable it's
not even funny
oh my gosh there's so blendable it makes
me sick okay now we're gonna go in with
the bronze contour stick the reason I'm
putting a base down first is because you
know we're gonna probably want to stay
on as long as you possibly can at least
I do I know I do and so I think having a
base down first will really help the
longevity dovish and kind of take the
Beauty Blender and buff that and like
they're blending out so easily it does
make me so happy in felt good
tell me that it's not gorgeous okay
cause this is what it looks like with
just the bronze
and I think it looks super pretty we're
trying to look with more bronzy and kind
of glowing in giving this dimension when
I don't look like such a ghost and now
we're going to go in with the contour
stick and this one we're going to be a
little bit more precise with the stick
and we're going to just do right by the
top of the ear and that's all we're
gonna do and we're going to blend it out
I don't want to be too hard with this
one because once has much more of a gray
tone to it and the bronzy one does the
lighter with this one I think the better
and I'm gonna go ahead and use my g3
from more feet to really just kind of
help blend that in I'm just gonna go out
with a Beauty Blender I just kind of
press over it just to give us a little
diffusion yeah off the views do the same
thing on forehead I go and take the
laura mercier setting powder okay
seriously this putter ended up in life
it really fucking is do it's so good it
kept me matte throughout the day it
gives me a beautiful like airbrush
finish I just love it so we're just
gonna go in I'm really just pressing on
the powder over our face underneath our
eye - you cannot forget that because you
will crease with a creasing monster and
don't forget your lids - because we did
use the concealer as our base and now
we're just grab a big fluffy brush just
dust away any extra part that might be
there we're going to finish our face
with the Kat Von D shade and light
palette because I love this bad boy so
much we're gonna grab the highlight
middle shade right here on a morphe and
for 38 like my highlighting brush of
life we're just going to really just
press that in on top of the highlighted
areas where we put the Smashbox contour
stick the t-zone as well and then go for
shits and giggles let's go ahead and put
in mac emphasized highlighting sculpting
powder just a little bit just to
brighten it even more we really don't
need to step but you know I'm a big ass
directly not hard delicious hate that I
feel like I have to be quiet because
people are like in my house like there's
like workers and shit and I'm like I'm
not gonna be quiet
I don't care where it continued with a
shade light palette we're gonna grab
subconscious with the makeup geek
rounded blush brush I use this brush all
the time for contouring I just feel like
it's perfect it's precise it's easy
towards the back of our ear and just use
that as our contouring shade and just
kind of buff it in we're not doing
anything too precise and this is just
really going to ensure that we have it
on a lot longer throughout the night or
I mean we're going to prom for goodness
sakes like I'm not about to be on down
on the dance floor and my contour is
melting off like beat her who has time
mii-chan cup those cheekbones
yo bitch so we have our contouring
highlighting done we're going with some
blush I'm gonna take a makeup geeks
where are you I think it's spellbound
because it's literally huh spellbound
makeup geek blush which is the perfect
peachy pink I think it's so beautiful
and we're gonna grab that on a morphine
m500 which is a big fluffy brush I wanna
go to hand with the blush so that's what
I'm grabbing a big fluffy brush like
this oh it's so pretty huh go how would
you live so long and then we're gonna go
ahead and highlight we're gonna use the
makeup Pro sculpting duo in the shade -
this is seriously so beautiful like I
like I really die so we're gonna
actually just grab the highlight shade
on the bronzing shade I feel like it's a
little bit just to mourn for me it's a
little bit too orange and poking wrong I
love warm bronzers and I love warm like
contouring College I really do but I
mean I can only go so far
before I turn orange I just hang up I
can't go ain't taking the morphe 501 and
I'm really loading that bitch up with
that gold that Oh makes me wet I mean
not really but like kind of like it
looks like a look wet you know so we
have up the base of our face done like
the foundation promise and go and use
the Kat Von D lock in load makeup
setting mist I love this stuff I'm soon
use it right now so I feel like I just
need a little refresher has like it
smells a cucumber it's so a go into
Sephora spray this on your face and tell
me didn't select your color water you
can't cuz it smells like that I love
this shit okay so I'm gonna go and do my
brows off-camera cause I feel like it
takes a little while I can definitely do
a brow routine video if you guys are
interested in that I'm just gonna do it
off camera clicks I thought you're just
gonna waste some time so I'll be right
back cool so we have the brows on I
don't know why I didn't feeling like I
wanted to go more fleek lately I just
feel like a strong I just feel like
doing strong brows right now I don't
know what it is
I just do maybe cuz I do this and using
bitches don't fuck me when I do this you
know me what okay let's our eyes so I'm
gonna try my very best to recreate this
look I do not remember exactly every
single call that I used by grab colors I
think I'm pretty sure I used so this is
what I have
so please wish me luck on this I know
you guys do because you guys want it I
figured I'd go ahead and zoom you guys
in
because I really want you guys to really
focus on the eyes because this eye look
is a little bit more it's not hard to do
but there's some steps there's a couple
steps to it so I figure it'd be a lot
easier for me to zoom you guys in first
we're gonna go ahead and we're and start
with beaches and cream by makeup geek
you guys know with my favorite rendition
shade of all time and I'm going to take
that on a sigma e-40 blending brush and
we're just toss that into the crease is
our transition shade so you don't need
to be too neat with it I just got a new
Sigma e-40 so I'm just like and then I'm
going to go ahead and actually take a
sigma e55 which is a flat shader brush
ball my morphe brushes were dirty you
guys I'm sorry forgive me but they're
all Turkey right now I'm and I'm taking
the Anasazi a bling eyeshadow and now
I'm going to put that on my brow bone as
my highlight already have like some
concealer down there and I used to clean
up my brow so we're just gonna really
help set that ish in motion what am I
saying have an idea and then we're gonna
actually go in with Poppy by Nikki
because well I were to take a very small
amount of it and now we're gonna toss
into the crease with that same 8:40 this
is really gonna give us that warmth we
should have something like this it's
nice warm transition shade we're going
to go in with mocha autumn more feet and
4-3-3 a clean this one in time omocha by
makeup geek and that we're gonna kind of
focus on the outer corner press it into
the outer corner to the crease a little
bit we're really going to run that into
the crease about half way into our I
then went along with that 8:40 and just
blend that away it's really crucial to
go in with the steps and just continue
to blend with an 8:40 or any kind of big
fluffy brush I think it's really really
really important that's what everything
is kind of blended and transitioned now
I'm going to go in with that same m43
three with makeup geek corrupt just a
very tiny amount of it because it's very
people too you don't need a lot and that
were to concentrate on the outer corner
and slightly bringing it upwards into
that puppy not nearly as far as mocha
though and then same thing going without
you forty and blend out the black my
single with an e30 pencil brush by Sigma
because I really want to really
concentrate the Blackland like is yo job
like you get paid to blame
there we go so now we're going with the
fun part the lid color so we're gonna go
in with a flat dense packing brush I'm
going to use these Sigma F 70 which is a
dense packing brush I'm gonna go in with
make a geek grin spand eyeshadow this
color is literally life like actually
literally life we're really just
pressing that on right up to the
transition shades in my crease - it real
bright so actually I'm gonna go with my
finger and take grandstand my finger and
press that onto the lid I really wanted
to be shiny even more shiny the shadows
are really great with your fingers
because they give you this nice foil
intensity like that then I'm going to
take a morphe 326 and in the spotlight
by makeup geek now we're going to place
on our inner corner as our highlight
this shit highlights like a motherfucker
and all so with the top of the lid looks
like I think looks so pretty oh my god
yeah so they're probably yeah
yeah of course so I'm going to take
mocha and mix it in with peaches and
cream and we're gonna take em orpheum
508 it's a very tiny amazing brush I
getting underneath the lash line and
then I blend that out a little bit and
then we're gonna grab mr. right now Dean
pencil by the balm which I've used
before on my channel I just really like
it and I'm just gonna blend out
whatever's left underneath my waterline
I'll just kind of blend that out looks
something like that
yes okay so I'm gonna go finish all that
really quickly off camera man laughs
about to die Swingle finish real quick
and I'll be right back and now we have
both eyes completely done without the
lashes and chin
so our just going to put some mascara on
where I'm going to use the benefit
roller lash mascara I've been really
obsessing over this mascara recently I
used it so the first time in my one
brand tutorial of Benefit Cosmetics and
I used it this way but one of my
followers told me to use it like with
the groovy part pointing down so I've
done that and it really that makes a
huge difference it really does like
extend my lashes so much I love this
mascara okay so now that we have our
mascara on we're gonna go in with
blinking Butte lashes in the style
Samantha which was created with Samantha
from battle ash um you guys don't know
who she is like please look her up she's
freaking so sick and they created a lash
together and they're beautiful but these
are the ones I was wearing
in that video I have a coded link view
lashes so you do get a saves 10% off if
you guys are interested well they're so
beautiful and them so much I'm just
using a mink wink lash applicator it's
super super cute and efficient we got
one on tell me these lashes are not
giving it to you like hard lashes are on
a latest poppin bitch yes let me go
ahead and have you guys in what they
look like and those were the eyes so now
we're gonna go and do the lips my
favorite prank is we're going with NYX
people neutral lip liner I believe that
they are in stock right now I've been
getting so many tweets and stuff like
that about like how you guys cannot find
next to a neutral I'm sorry I I use this
bitch so much it's so funny because one
of my followers in Texas I think her
name's Eileen I could be wrong that she
founded NYX people neutral lip liner she
end up giving me 11 of them so I'm like
so set with next week we knew to look
lighter so thank you to Eileen for
giving me those lip liner I really
appreciate it like I was on my last leg
of lip liners NYX was sold out for so
long
there was a lot for so freaking long and
I was just like dude how am I gonna get
my lip planner of light I mean I'm gonna
feel about halfway the lip in with the
lip liner like so I look like a troll
doll right now with now we're gonna go
in with Kim Chi doll lipstick by drawer
cosmetics which was made with Sophia
chain again congrats it's so beautiful
um by the way just letting you guys know
this is a very very very very light
color without a lip liner I think it
looks a too light a lot of people will
not be able to pull it off without a lip
liner I'm sitting it's on right now it
is so light so use a lip liner with it
trust me trust me oh it's so beautiful
very light peachy pink satin color and I
think it's so beautiful
and I think it really goes well with
this look because I feel like this look
the eyes are like what's catching the
attention of the peeps so you want to
keep the lip much more subdued and just
really pretty and nude and very like Kim
Kardashian you know okay but for those
of you who are not interested in doing a
very light nude pink let's go ahead and
do another lip option as well tell my
knee to exfoliate my lips right now
so bad huh and so the second option I
think that would go really great with
this I look is very smoothy baidarkas
Mex is a another color that they just
launched it's not it was not a collab
with anyone but it's a beautiful rosy
warm pink and I think it's I mean and
this is very smooth if you're into much
more of a still very neutral pink and
you don't know so nude but you stole
something on your lips that's really
pretty it's like your own lip color but
prettier kind of thing this lip is so
beautiful it's so beautiful oh I love it
I love it I love it trust me I'm not
trying to sell you guys on Gerard stuff
because I mean they have lipsticks and
they have glosses that I do not like
personally and so I don't only talk
about them on my channel so the ones I
do talk about my channel you guys know
like I whole heartedly believe and I
love them so much and yes I'm an
affiliate with them and you said codes
with them but actually believe that they
are great lipsticks I really honestly do
and I really mean that to you guys and
that's what I'm talking about them
kimchi dumb and very smoothie they just
launched them and I think they are so
beautiful oh my god I'm like I love this
lips on what like I love this lid oh my
gosh
wait I'll leave links and um codes
things like that down below up with
these guys okay so yes that was it for
the final I look face look and lip look
it says the whole look so hopefully you
guys liked it let me know what you guys
want to see next I'm thinking about
doing another prom let me know what kind
of colors and things like that you want
me to use this one's a much more of a
warm tone I it's much more like focus on
the eye subdued on the lid I can
definitely do a like intense lip and
more of a like subtle on the eye
