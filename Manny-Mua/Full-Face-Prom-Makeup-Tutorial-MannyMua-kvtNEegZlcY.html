bold prompt tutorial or you guys wanted
to see a natural pretty one the
Pole was dead even fifty fifty seven
eight thousand votes fifty fifty I've
never seen that before ever so I decided
to just mesh both world it's a bold look
but it's really really pretty I did a
nice just cut crease it's a nice warm
and pinky cut crease this look is
deathly catered to someone that is
wearing a pink prom dress or white prom
just a black prom dress things are more
on the neutral side I mean I would not
suggest this if you're wearing like a
green prom dress this is not look for
you I'm just saying but um this is

start this video off prom glam makeup
I'm so excited to be doing problem
videos I love prom i with my prom it was
really fun I was it was when I was
straight so this was fun time so first
things first I'm going to prime it the
face I'm into a whole face video today I
haven't done a whole face and so long
that I've been like missing it so it's
going to do that I'm gonna take this
brand new poor vanishing stick from
Estee Lauder I've heard good things
about it I have actually try to get out
here take a pore minimizer so we're
gonna try that bad boy out today I'm
just gonna right over the spots I have a
lot of pores center of the nose on the
forehead cheeks I think what I do after
that I just like rub it in I haven't
tried this yeah holy am i doing for
some freshens you're just thinking it as
a pore minimizing primer benefit
Porefessional same type of situation
okay Smashbox primer water on the face
this is brand new on the rest of the
face where I didn't put the pore
vanishing stick how are you guys doing
today if I haven't talked you guys into
so freaking long I've been filmed in a
while it's been a freaking while since I
filmed so I'm sorry if you guys missed
me making it you guys probably didn't
miss me though because I freakin I'm on
snapchat on Twitter Instagram every
other platform so because every follow
me on those I'm just saying
so I'm gonna grab the NARS matte velvet
skin tint this is like their newest
foundation I believe I just put a little
dollop on my hand it looks like a moosie
consistency is a movie start being that
into the skin I'm using the shade grown
lend the coverage is nice okay kinda
reminds me of the consistency of the
Tarte Amazonian clay full coverage one
it kinda reminds you of that it smells
like sunscreen broad-spectrum SPF 30
sunscreen holy
okay um sunscreen it got it be careful
with flash photography I don't know
about you guys but I'm going a problem
nowadays I'm going full coverage I've
went full cover just and I'm gonna
make sure that I look B I'm
sorry like that's just how it is it
doesn 16 mama we're going to prom full
coverage let's go wonderful we have the
base on I think it looks pretty friggin
snatched I'm diggin it we're gonna take
a brand you can see that I haven't even
tried yet this is the Marc Jacobs
remarkable concealer it's a full
coverage concealers so you probably know
I'm gonna be into it on a little more
4:46 this is a nice tapered small brush
so good for concealer I'm just going to
this concealer I've heard really good
things about this concealer so I said
you try it I'll recover up the darkness
already that's like perfection I'm sorry
darkness where darkness who down the
center of my nose
oh wait that the NARS foundation is
settling in my Lyons I can already see
it oh my god wait that's not good
watch out for the foundation settling
because um I'm dealing with that touch
dude taking the same view bland I'm
gonna blend out this concealer honestly
this concealer is really freaking pretty
holy but because it's so creamy you
need to make sure that you want to set
this bad boy I mean I haven't really
tried it yet but I do know that really
creamy concealer is tend to crease so
I'm taking the Laura Mercier translucent
setting powder and using that same
beauty butter and setting the under-eye
just to make sure that there's no
creasing happening throughout the night
and we're going to prom who wants to
crease and not high now that we're full
coverage is oh I'm going to take the
airbrush flawless finish skin perfecting
micro powder and the shade is 0-2 by
Charlotte Tilbury on a more feet 41 and
I'm just going to go ahead and go in
with this powder all over the face to
set the rest of the face it can be such
a beautiful airbrushed finish oh my god
you guys if you have not tried this
powder I'm not kidding you it's freaking
amazing
okay guys I'm not really sure if I'm
feeling the NARS foundation right now
I'm not sure I should have gone in with
my do or air flashes should I should I
use my tried-and-true I should eat
instead if you're going to prom don't
 try any foundation just don't do
it
taking NC 25 powder down my neck I'm
gonna take the Marc Jacobs tantric
bronzer is the tantric bronzer I'm not
kidding you is the best chef a lot on
that side holy crap let me just come on
down then calming down
I'm just excited for prom okay I wish I
had some crazy prom experience stories
that I've been so freaking cool imagine
had some crazy prom experience oh like
 lose my virginity and I
didn't though
no I problem not with the girl either
come on even if you're not a date
it you only had a day go with your
friends and you don't have friends go
with your siblings and if you
don't assume things with your mama
just go taking the Marc Jacobs insta
mark powder the light yellow one on a
more fatty 48 just gonna go ahead and
highlight underneath the eyes one of the
best
under-eye highlighting powders I ever
tried and I'm just going over the spots
that I already highlighted earlier I'm a
big believer in reinforcing the
highlight that you did with concealer or
whatever highlighting cream product you
use with a powder because if you're
doing your makeup for prom most likely
you're doing it during the daytime and
not at nighttime and you want that
to stay I've heard stories chÃ¢tillon
contour up the skin I'm gonna take thee
morphe 50 brush and the bad habit shade
by makeup geek the contour shade and
cooky you guys slay me with these
contour shades this is more of a warm
contour shades I'm really not honestly
like I'm in this phase right now where I
like to use only warm tone contours like
I'm not really into the cool tone um
contouring Reina I don't know why I'm
just in this phase let me have my faces
let me deal with what I have to deal
with this brush is such a sick
contouring brush and makes blending so
seamless just a little bit on the
temples as well
awesome let's one cook it because I'm
not good allow this where's my brush we
got to cook the cotton because this is
not happening this is too dirty I'm
taking a little morphe m45 8 brush and
the Laura Mercier translucent setting
powder I'm gonna go underneath the
contour line where I wanted to go and
just drag it to my mouth and that's
gonna really help clean up our contour a
lot I'm not kidding this will make a
huge difference in your contour line
it's gonna make it look so sure
hi I'm in this good nose contouring
phase right now I just wanted to contour
the on my nose and I want a little
petite cute snatched ass
rhinoplasty/nose we're just going with
it we're just going with it I'm gonna be
taking the shade breakup which is cool
porcelain in the makeup geek contouring
pen and this little brush by luck see
beauty this is the 182 this is actually
created by JD lady here on YouTube and
on Instagram I love her so much
JD I love you so much if you ever see
this video I love you literally as
specifically for a nose contour anyone's
ever interested in nose contouring
there's literally a brush for it and
it's called the 182 by Lefty beauty and
I'm just gonna go in and start carving
out these nostrils starting at the
bridge of my nose going downwards and as
I'm going down I'm just tapering in
slightly just to give me a little little
snatch now you know okay I'm up
on his nose contour I feel like a look
like
having a beak so now that I feel
like I up the nose a little bit
what we're going to do to clean it up
another little trickster moment that
we're having taking the same brush and
the same Laura Mercier translucent
powder we're gonna cook the areas around
it just like I did on my cousin in that
tutorial that we did the problem makeup
tutorial we're gonna do the same thing
on the sides of my nose I'm honestly not
the best contouring nose is it's just
what it is I'm not that good at it but
I'm gonna still try my muscle practice
so we're gonna highlight the face down
while the face is cooking down I'm gonna
be taking this new highlighter that I
just got this is the Burberry number one
highlighter it's like a white pearl eyes
highlighter I got it because Jeffrey
Jeffrey Starr girl I saw watches at your
house and I was gasping for air with how
beautiful they were and how reflected
they were and I like the reflective
powder so I'm gonna use my little morphe
fan brush to 310 and start going to town
with this Burberry highlighter
let's see how it looks I'm excited to
try it out the first time I'm trying on
camera oh it's you
just a forewarning and this is a white
ass highlighter um if you are darker in
complexion than I am what I suggest
using this note I would not I would use
like champagne pop or something else
that would be more Universal but this is
just a beautiful highlighter and because
I am a lighter in complexion I'm gonna
use it blush oldie but goodie works with
every single look of all-time warm soul
by Mac more 53 you guys this blush will
never do me wrong it literally will
never do me wrong this is one of the
best blushes I've ever used in my entire
life
cool another highlighted brush off the
cooking of the contour off the nose as
well cool so I think we're pretty done
with the face right now I think it looks
pretty nice and natural and glowing not
natural come out we're full governed is
by this w is that good crazy we're gonna
take the makeup ever miss and fix and
I'm going to spray that on the face and
then we'll move on to the eye okay cool
so I already did my brows off of camera
let me know if you guys want to see an
updated brow routine I'm sure you guys
go through your brow phases too and I'm
just going through this phase of my
brows right now so just let me know if
you guys want to see a brow routine and
updated one and I'll definitely fill
that for you guys and now I'm going to
take the Smashbox 24 hour primer and
that's gonna prime my lids if I've ever
suggested a primer to for your eyes this
is the one I'm not kidding you this is
the one that prevents my eyes from
creasing the most out of all the primers
that I have this is just a great primer
because it really helps keep the oils of
my lids at bay I think it's because it
has like the silicone in it I'm not
quite sure yeah so we're going to start
on the ice I really want to do like a
cut crease kind of situation a lot of
people requests you need to do like a
cut crease like something really cool
and different and kind of dramatic first
things first I'm gonna go in take sorbet
shadow by anastasiya mixed with cupcake
eyeshadow by makeup geek on a more fatty
27 not just going to go into the crease
I'm going to create a nice pinky dusty
pink crease and these two colors
combined will really give me that pretty
color that I'm looking for so beautiful
the cupcake color is definitely more of
a pink tone and the sorbet color is a
very very soft very soft like petal pink
combined with cupcake it will give you
this beautiful like warm pinky
transition now taking a morphe m4 33 and
uh Nastasia dusty rose this is a little
bit darker it's much more of a plum eros
color I'm gonna go and start etching out
the crease more and you really give me
that definition lower than the other
shades and kind of winging it out as
well you guys see that how it's out on
the outer corner and it's kind of taking
it out a little bit giving it like
another extra wing kind of situation
that's going to go all the way into the
inner crease and really start to buff
that into the crease trying to keep it
as off of the lid as possible because we
are trying to do more of a cut crease
and now that we have that dusty rose
color down there you can see that the
lid is pretty bare and then we're going
to be going in with the darkest color of
the four I'm going to take cherry cola
by makeup geek on a more Fiji 36 brush
and that's going to go on the most outer
corner and lowest to the crease that
we're going to be cutting this is gonna
give it a lot of definition to the outer
corner and really start to really create
the shape of this cut crease
honestly don't even worry if it's not
that knee either because we're going to
be taking another product to clean up
the bottom of the cut crease and you
should have something like this so far
we're going to be taking this new
product that I literally just got this
is the pure eye polish base topcoat and
it supposed to be like a pie base for
shadows so I'm going to use that to kind
of carve out my cut crease so we're
going to take is the morphe m42 one and
just really load up this liquidy
consistency this is in the shade satin
and I'll have different colors but I
hear really great things about the high
polishes like really good things so I'm
going to use this to carve out the
bottom of the eye this is we're gonna
start to see more of a clean cut crease
that we're doing so we're gonna go ahead
and start using this and go up all the
way to the edge that you want it to end
and as you can see it's already starting
to clean it up a little bit you can
always use concealer for this if you
don't have this product no problem
whatsoever I'm just using this eye base
because I do have it and the color I'm
gonna pop my lid is gonna be more on the
pink side so that's why I'm using this
so which would look something like this
now it's a nice just beautiful cut
crease nice and sharp and defined and it
looks sick it's like a floating
crease I love this look okay awesome so
we should have something like this on
both sides of the high it's a nice just
cut crease like we were saying it's
dramatic but it's soft and dainty I
don't know I just love it mmm so now
we're going to do is gonna go and put
the top lid color on top of this since I
did this like really satin pretty
pinkish lid I'm gonna go on top of that
with an eyeshadow l'oreal infallible
shadow in the shade amber rush obsessed
with this shadow and the formula how did
I never know about these these are
freaking sick use my finger and press on
top of the satin base that we have this
is the next step look at that look
at that so you should have
something like this so far and you could
stop here you could definitely just stop
here and call it a day and it looks
stunning and Whipple lashes on holiday
but because I was challenged to use a
glitter I'm going to I'm gonna be taking
makeup geeks lightyear which is a
whitish pink pigment glitter kind of
situation I'm gonna Park that on be
beginning a third of my pie just to give
a little bit of a pinky golden glow at
the beginning half try just to the whole
 lid okay you convinced me this
is a glitter pigment is definitely more
of a pigment so you really don't need to
use like a glitter base with this
because it's essentially a pigment you
don't need it I'm just gonna go ahead
and put this all over just to give a
little bit more of a dimension to it
amazing so this is what we have so far a
nice just a glittery cut crease oh looks
so smushed I'm gonna take the Kat
Von D liquid liner in trooper I think
it's called now we're just gonna do an
eyeliner with this look no rhyme or
reason I'm just gonna go ahead and do
eyeliner you can do however you want to
do if you want to keep the middle spot
there if you guys wanna connect the
crease that's fine too I don't know what
I'm gonna do yet we're just gonna kind
of go with it and see where this takes
us
almost connecting without quiet boom
that's what we'll do great so we have
the liner done now I love how this looks
it's like a it's an isis floating crease
go ahead and start with the bottom lash
line now taking that same a36 and dusty
rose from my Nastasia and i'm going to
put that on the lower lash line just to
kind of bring the attention on the lower
lash line as well because I do want to
keep it nice and cohesive throughout the
entire look I'm gonna go ahead and blend
that down here and then taking a little
bit of sorbet same brush I'm going to
blend that underneath that shadow just
to give me more of a diffused blended
out look just like we did on the top
same exact thing on the bottom and then
taking that same cherry cola shade on my
trusty e43 brush gotta put that closest
to the lashes leaving the first third of
the eye I'm going to keep that
completely blank but I'm gonna go mostly
all the way in tart in a rim liner in
the shade nude just to open up the eyes
a little bit more I decided for the
inner corner of the eye I forgot to
highlight it I'm gonna take that same
Burberry highlighter on this cute little
morphe m32 six just a highlight inner
corner a little bit same on the brow
bone gonna put on a pair of lashes and
we are done with the eyes and this is
the final I look I put on a pair of
Bella lashes by new bounce um they're my
favorite lashes I think they're so
stunning they flirt really really
beautifully and I just think they look
super good I put some mascara on and
that's it for the eyes I'm a Glenn zoom
you guys in to see what they look like
up close
so that's City not only the eyes that
I'm going to finish off the face with
the lips so I'm gonna go in with a lip
line first I'm gonna take the Marc
Jacobs lip liner in the shade Primrose I
believe it's called awesome so now I'm
gonna go in with charmed lipstick oh
this is my collab color with over
cosmetics I love this color so much it
is such a beautiful medium tone pinky
Brown just darker nude it just I'm not
