this look I have going on right now I
got so many requests to film this look
when I tried my hardest to recreated the
best as I could in the video I had it in
which is my Q&amp;amp;A I filmed a Q&amp;amp;A like
three weeks ago so I completely forgot
what I use my trap my hardest recreated
for you guys I know the lip isn't
exactly the same but it's as close as I
could freakin get trust me that's for a
rad
that's from right it feels so good to be
back I just got back to San Diego
yesterday and it feels amazing to be
back I missed you guys so much and i
miss filming that was about 4 18 days in
la i was gone and i had videos i had
pre-recorded - how about for you guys
because obviously like i wanted to have
videos up for you guys to watch pew
films an IP recorded while i was gone so
I didn't seem like I was gone for too
long but I'm just so happy to be back
and I'm leaving back for a little while
so thank goodness I'm not going to LA
for another two weeks for Jen beauty so
I'm excited pretend beauty and I'm
excited to meet anyone that's going to
be there it's funny because I asked on
answering when I asked on Twitter I was
like who wants to see this look and I
got like 80% yes but who's going through
the comments cuz obviously like if I'm
asking you guys the opinion I read like
all the comments cuz I truly want to
know what you guys think you know what I
mean so I'm not just asking you guys in
vain I want to know so I can film
something for you guys that's not like
five knows in a row and I'm like the
overwhelming amount of people said yes
to film it so I just decided to film it
and I think it's a fun look I think it's
perfect for summer I think it's perfect
for spring and it's an easy tutorial
yeah new tools are fun but why not throw
in a pop of color and there that is what
technical at the time we have you guys
wanted kind of video don't watch
you guys know the drill went that and
I'll get you guys to the tutorial I'll
stop rambling I'll see you guys later
bye
back to you okay awesome so let's go
ahead and start with our face bear I
always just want to think bear ass I
don't know why I just do recently so I
already primed my skin with primer and
moisturizer so I'm just go ahead into my
foundation right now first I'm gonna be
using the combination that I've been
obsessed with recently like I'm talking
like obsessed like every single thing
I've been going to die have to wear
makeup to I've been using this
combination it is the Loreal Pro matte
infallible mixed with the NARS all day
luminous mixing them together it just
gives me the most beautiful full
coverage finish it just it's so nice
like the pro matte is a matte foundation
obviously it's Pro matte and then the
NARS is a more voluminous all-day kind
of foundations so the fact that it's
like a matte foundation mixed with the
luminous foundation lasts all day gives
me a natural glow but I'm still full
coverage it is just sickening I just
mixed it on the back of my hand and
slapped it off so with this combination
I like to use it with a Beauty Blender
and I'll just kind of press the Beauty
Blender in like stop like that looks
like skin but like perfect skin you know
just let you guys know that the mecca
gig website has Beauty blenders on it
cheaper than anywhere else I've seen and
it's like eating buff I think I'll leave
a link down below it is an affiliate
link but if you guys aren't into that
whole thing I just I just want to let
you guys know but if you guys are into
that just open up a new tab and go to
makeup geek and you will find Beauty
blenders for cheaper than normal that's
not cool
see how just looks like so perfect I
don't even want to explain how much I
love this combination I just think it
looks so good so under the height we're
gonna do the Urban Decay Naked wait this
complete coverage mixed with the Mac
prep room prime also under-eye obsession
recently die gag-worthy I'm gonna use
some of that and then on top on that
that's a little bit excessive what the
concealer just don't do it me OK on
camera it looks kind of insane not gonna
lie I know it looks white so we just
needs a Beauty Blender and we're gonna
Pat underneath the eye down to my nose
press and the Beauty Blender will really
help soak up the extra product that you
don't need see doesn't that I told you
it's not gonna look that crazy I just
gonna look bright and awake right dead
right awake then now go ahead and set
underneath the eye if you need to I do
cuz I get crazy I'm gonna use a morphine
f138 and the Laura Mercier under-eye
brightening powder literally
I'm obsessed with it's the best under
eye setting powder I've ever used
probably ever so I'm just gonna use that
said it do the other side now that those
areas are concealed I'm gonna go ahead
and use the pepper my pen a little bit
to highlight on the face and lid on and
then just kind of blend it out with a
Beauty Blender and then that way out
it's burning but I'll go take the laura
mercier translucent setting powder on a
hatter puff so I'm just watching that
translucent powder and I'm really just
gonna press it onto the skin not too
much not excessively just taking enough
to really set the foundation in like
really suck the I mean my god and
now I'm gonna go ahead and take V make
if ever Pro finish powder in 1:18 and
I'm just gonna use that to kind of dust
off any of the translucent powder that
was on my face this is my color Patrick
does this and it's really cool it's
really cool another and I love it to go
ahead and take that down your neck as
well cuz you guys know how to take
powder foundations on my neck rather
than taking liquids I mean like I don't
know why I just don't want taking liquid
something up not that it looks weird I
don't think it's weird I just don't like
wasting liquid foundation on my neck I
don't know I'm weird looking weird hmm I
don't know why I don't know how it's
picking up on camera but I swear
matching right now like bitch I am
matching neck and fingers guys can we
just talk about the new morphe elite
brushes I have been using these non-stop
these are my favorite Martian purses
that they've ever ever launched they are
so good that elite like I don't even
know like there's something to care of
course they don't have her bacteria
they're so ridiculously soft what it
feels like a baby's ass honestly the
more feet elite brushes are to die for
amazing and I'm gonna be using some of
them in this tutorial because they're
perfect I'm not even kidding
I'm not even Keaney so I'm gonna take
the middle shade light palette color I
might eat - Ally brush I'm just gonna
start to bronze myself I feel like I
look I don't agree now and I love it go
and take it on your cheeks as well just
a little bit of bronzer I also like it
take it just around my jawline just to
give me that that really pretty glow the
JLo glow that everyone wants except it's
matte slightly delusional today don't
Hawaii now I'm gonna go in and use my
makeup geek rounded blush brush you guys
know this is my favorite contouring
brush of actual life I don't take this
color right here the more cool tone
shade I'm just gonna use a little bit of
that a very little bit of that because
it's very pigmented this shade in my
parallel paintin
I'm sure you start to kind of put that
into the hollows of my cheeks and really
start to contour with it slightly right
underneath my cheek
phone and blending it upwards to give me
that lifted effect look at that cut in
like bitches kya
with that cheekbone ooh I'm also gonna
go ahead and take the middle shade this
beautiful button on that color I'm gonna
take that underneath that I just give it
a little bit more of a highlight I'm
gonna take that all the way back and I
like to take it back from myself because
I have a long face so I really like to
accentuate getting myself a more angular
face I don't have to hide cheekbones and
I have a very long face so I really like
to pretend like I do no no no so that's
why I could take it out for myself
because my face is very long does that
make sense
I don't know but doing this really helps
make it look like I have much higher
cheekbones and I really do because I did
so and then if you think it's too harsh
between the steps go ahead and just
blend it out banana highlighting shade
from Kevin Dean and it's all good okay
cool so that is the base of my face in
that video I was wearing my obsession
blush because I haven't stopped wearing
it my Becca wild honey blush I'm taking
that on the new III Italy brush my
morphe this is probably I might talk 3
of their newest brushes this is I don't
know say about it's a tapered fluffy
brush that's extremely soft and just
it's the perfect time it's super free
you guys need to get it honestly like
low-key I'm just gonna use that Becca
well honey blush and my face like I've
said in the past it is like a burnt
apricot because a beautiful tan warmth
to the skin it's so beautiful I don't
have cheekbones to use that did you put
it everywhere but now for the highlight
so excited so jar cosmetics it just
released highlighters literally like
sorry I don't mind you it has a little
GC it's like a stamp of GC in it and
it's a highlighter it's literally like
how that happened use on my face yet
because they mean they just launched I
just got that recently so I'm gonna try
them right out so I'm gonna be using the
g23 fan brush buying morphine load up
highlighter I'm just gonna try it on
you win this is so beautiful this is
much more of a golden highlight the feel
of it reminds me of the mary-lou manizer
by the balm let me swatch out my hand to
things seen it's like a golden champagne
color that's exactly like when I would
have clean it is it's so pretty
oh my god they released two so I'm just
gonna show you guys so that's what I'm
not gonna put it on because this doesn't
go for my look but they just released
another one it's like a rose gold one
let me just swatch it for you guys but
the one I'm wearing is called Marilyn
it's the new star powders star powders
Marilyn and Lucy I think they're
mirrored after Hollywood glam stars like
that's what makes sense to me Marilyn
and Lucy
now obviously leave some codes down
below for the powders if you guys are
interested in it they are affiliate code
so just letting you guys know if you
guys are not interested in using my
affiliate codes I understand a hundred
percent but I like to tell you guys
anyway because I just feel like it's
more honest you know what I mean so
they're definitely code but if you want
to try them out which I think you
totally started looking at myself on my
screen I'm like that's the
highlight I think I wanna try them out
which I think you guys should have a go
for you guys so I'll leave it linked
down below okay okay so know what the
face let's go and do the eyes now yeah
cool so it's time for the ice
I've already primed my lids and I
already filled in my brows with some
brow gel I don't remember exactly what I
used for the entire thing if I'm being
truly honest but I'm gonna try my
hardest recreate it okay so we're gonna
go and take the new morphe 27 brush
which is like a freaking fluffy brush I
don't know I can I love it and I'm gonna
take beaches and cream and Peach
Smoothie by making pecan I'm just gonna
mix those together as my transition
shade I'm gonna put that into the crease
and just kind of flare it out you don't
need to be me with this whatsoever look
on the lid and like all my I was kind of
messy so don't meanie it trust me like
it doesn't matter we're gonna go ahead
and take a morphe 13 which is a new
brush for them and I'm gonna mix
bitten and Koko bigger by Menken peek as
well I'm gonna put that into the crease
very lightly this brush is extremely
fluffy so it's awesome because it
doesn't put down too much product I'm
gonna run that into the crease
slightly very slightly and just very
light when why promotion
and then take that same b27 and blend
that out I'm gonna take a more Fiji 27
which is the little pencil brush and
beauty mark by Gong Sun Zhi Beverly
Hills and that's going to go on my outer
corner in the little v-shape lower to
the lash line than usual and the
slightly into the crease as well and I'm
just kind of feathering it from the
outside in just to kind of help blend it
slightly I'm gonna go and take that same
e where are you you 13 with no
additional product and blend it out even
more this is such a good little blending
brush oh my god oh my lava and then
blend that out I don't turn it sideways
to help blend into the crease as well
dude so you see these new brushes from
morphe like meek my blending life I feel
a little bit like my blending game a
little bit more strong like knocking ye
I think I'm pretty good at blending I
feel like one of my better qualities and
makeup is blending and I think these
brushes just really really add to it I
wish that I had these brushes when I
made my favorite morphe brushes video
like if I did have these brushes by that
time half of them would be in it I'm
just saying hi Jas I'm just laying in
okay so now we're into the bottom of the
eye real quick I'm gonna take the same
colors peaches and cream and Peach
Smoothie I'm gonna run that underneath
the lash line with that same pencil
brush by morphe as well also I never had
this brush um I got this recently so
that's why I figure like what the
where did you get that brush I've never
had it
whatever damn basically what I do on top
I'm gonna do on the bottom it's a
transition now I'm gonna take a new
brush I also got is the g28 my morphe
it's a cute little wing and I'm gonna
mix bitten and Coco bear again slightly
on the brush not a lot and I'm gonna put
that underneath the lash line it's
really hard to like show you guys this
part because I'm like trying to look up
here and I'm like look at myself down
budge and it takes a little bit of
beauty mark very slightly and that even
closer to the lash line only on the
outer third of the eye
cool so the eye is done basically this
part that I've done now of course the
part that people want to know what the
hell's going on so a lot of you guys are
right it is the new makeup geek foiled
shadow in Pegasus I'm gonna put that on
the inner corner of my eye I really
loaded my inner corner with this Pegasus
color like I'm talking loading this
bitch so I'm gonna put it here and it
was
extremely bright in that video it's not
the most beautiful color but kennyman I
ended up also taking starry I didn't you
make a geek shadow with and I put that
in the center to give it a really
intense different kind of glow like
combining them it's like a blue and
silver teal reflect and then on that I
also took Mac reflect teal glitter which
is they have it in this my friend na VI
gave me a sample of hers think you know
that if you're watching this out if you
are but thank you for giving this my Mac
and I'm gonna take them make you forever
aqua steal a drop of that aqua seal
first and then the reflex one of my
favorite reflex glitter that Mac has
never done it's so stinking beautiful
and makes me thought no I'm just gonna
press the glitter then of course because
it is glitter you will have some fallout
that's fine and that is the reflect I'm
just no to the other eye off camera real
quick and I'll be your back so went
ahead and I curled my lashes and I put
mascara on off camera I'm just gonna
tell you that's what I use so we just
kind of save some time for the top phase
might benefit roller lash of course it's
like my favorite mascara arena of the
moment for the bottom the extend to play
big lash by Mac because I feel like it
just I feel like it gives me lashes I
don't have on the bottom I love this
mascara in the bottom it's so good and I
also put on the inner rim of my
waterline tart inner rim on the lashes I
was wearing in that video I'm pretty
sure they were number fours by blinking
view so it's going to play this because
that is what I'm wearing so go ahead and
apply your lashes like so boom
okay the lashes are on I love the way
these lectures give my eyes like that
effect that like elongated cat eye
winged effect these are on their last
limb though bitch like I wear these all
the time I probably were these like
probably 15 times like literally I like
to wear them out because I feel like
these ones are more like a demure lash
Perry and I feel like I've worn them so
much that they're under the last little
limb trying to so wear them even though
I probably shouldn't be okay great so
let me just go in the me guys in with
the panel it looks like this is what it
looks like anything is done
now for the lip okay this lip is no joke
because I used several things that they
were honest eyes your products to fill
ik with lipsticks and a gloss of hers to
make that like orange e coral so I'm
going to electric coral first on my lips
I probably should look line but whatever
so that's one layer with that color and
now I'm gonna go in with the color neon
coral you can leave it like this because
this looks bomb cuz I'm gonna
try to match the color as best as I can
I'm gonna put in neon coral on top
mostly in the center use my finger to
kind of blend it together
okay so last but not least I want to
take the gloss candy coral on my lips
and I think this is the closest I'm
gonna get to cuz I don't remember they
filmed that video like three weeks ago
so wish me luck and this is it so I try
my hardest to create it so this is what
the final look comes out to hopefully
