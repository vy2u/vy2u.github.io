today's video as you guys can see from
the title I thought it would be really
fun to do a full face challenge kind of
video and I've seen a bunch of people do
a full face using foundation video and I
thought you know what it might be really
really fun to try doing a full face
using only concealers video
I've never taken this before I've never
done a full face using concealers or
awful face using foundation or anything
like that so I thought you know what let
me try doing this and see if I even can
I just grabbed a bunch of different
shades a bunch of different since the
others from a bunch of different brands
I just had bunch so many fucking times
well that's annoying anyway guys dr.
Taylor is going to be I have been
basically m.i.a
out of commission for the past week I've
been super super busy working on this
project that I've been doing and it's
just been a whirlwind and it was it's
not for lunar Beauty it's actually like
me as mani MUA so you guys will be
seeing that shortly I'm fucking excited
like I cannot wait to see what it is
yeah I'm sorry Emily I just feel like
I'm kind of out of it you know I haven't
filmed in a minute I'm trying to get
back into China you know as always if
you guys don't like this video you guys
do not like me please don't fucking
watch any other Joey that but if you
guys do like this video please go ahead
subscribe to my channel if you're not
already you will not be sorry my channel
is fucking awesome it really Haila ain't
but kidding and so without further adieu
what's going to get right into this full
face using only concealers
okay cool so let's go ahead and go right
in to today's video I am actually kind
of nervous to do this because these
full-face challenge videos is doing
something like random as fuck they get
nervous
first off with some lemare concealer and
this is gonna be like our base concealer
because it's like an ax stick and I
thought it would be not too bad
let's start with it's not like that
intense I've actually never used this
concealer on my face before so we're
just gonna do a couple Coco Coco Co
cause you know and then we're gonna go
ahead and bling Danning out we'll be
going in with some more things fresh
yeah that's not exactly what I'm
thinking with coverage wise I mean okay
so that's a natural concealer uh-huh
beautiful natural we're gonna have to
change that up a little bit I mean let's
go in with some Born This Way can see
there as our foundation instead oh
that's jaundice no maybe we can do Tarte
shape tape all over the face much better
hey do you see this red thing right
there guess what that's from you guys
you guys are never gonna guess guess
I'll give you two seconds one two yeah
you didn't guess huh anyway it's a
fucking burn it's a burn from a fucking
curling iron a curling iron it was a
hair person that was curling my hair she
burned the fuck out of my fucking
forehead and I almost screamed I'm not
kidding you like I've never been burned
in my face before from anything like
this and I almost went off on her I'm
not gonna lie you know usually I'm
really patient with this kind of with
people I'm really nice and I really
pretty princess but I swear when she
burnt me like in that split moment I
almost attacked her I'm not proud but
like it is what it is you know oh god my
face is gonna be poreless by the end of
this we can see we have concealer all
over the face so now let's go ahead and
do some concealer underneath our eyes
like actual concealer like for real for
real or take some on Kylie some Kylie
deep some some gypsum I love this
concealer y'all I really just love it I
cannot help that it's just a good one
and it's really beautiful okay you guys
I think we can do this you know I think
that we could make this happen I think
that will look beautiful like 100% dude
I have not done my makeup and literally
over a week and a half and I'm literally
forgetting what to do who's ever done
that were like you guys are like so used
to doing something but you don't do it
for like a little while and you all
Center like how do I do this that's how
I feel right now
cuz literally this past week I had
makeup on but I wasn't doing it myself
I was getting it done so I'm like uh
look you guys this is starting to get a
little crazy we're looking real white
and I think I'm living right now this is
the easy part of the concealing like a
normal Ennis of it all but as soon as we
began to like bronzing and contouring
with concealers oh there's full coverage
and then there's this hmm
so I decided for this video what I'm
going to do is I'm gonna be setting my
under eye just so we don't look so
Creasy and like look ugly you know
because we really want to give this a
fair shot so I'm just gonna set my under
eye really quickly and then we will
continue on that launched a thousand
ships bitch oh my god I'm Leary a cakey
disaster so now I'm going with little
bit more kind of concealer to bronze up
the skin oh that is yellow did we make a
mistake honey okay I mean like for now
like that's just what we're gonna have
to do you know because that's just the
guy I swear whatever I'm doing
challenges I'm so much more quiet cuz
I'm so concentrated on not being such a
full op do you guys know what I mean
with that I'm really concentrating right
now I'm trying really hard to not be a
flop for you guys and it literally is so
hard a little bit more of a cool tone
shade right there okay thank God for
Beauty blenders I think him every day
let's do a little bit on the nose okay
usually you can see those are very like
warm in nature like there's not a lot of
cool toned concealers that's just kind
of how it is because people usually want
to cover up like darkness and
discoloration and usually they need to
do that with like warmer tones in case
you guys are wondering Manuel why using
such orange shades does it look like
that motherfucking options up in this
piece don't okay I'm trying to get into
this shit like I'm getting into this let
me contra her nose with the cream I
don't do this okay I'm starting to look
painted honey like actual paint did okay
you guys we're getting somewhere
like we're actually getting somewhere
right now and I'm really excited that
I'm not looking as floppy as I talk
about oxidation how are you doing so for
a blush we're gonna do guys I remember
that
judy has these things called matchsticks
and they can be used as contour a
concealer and colors so I'm like you
know what let's go and use of matchstick
the second Klee they're promoted as any
kind of colored stick of like foundation
or concealer or anything that you might
need it for and I'm like you know what
perfect let's go and use that for blush
so I'm gonna take this matchstick in the
shade red day I'm gonna put that onto
the blush e-sports yeah Jesus Christ
actually really funny because I'm not
the biggest fan of the matchstick so I'm
like what I do and I use them Benji has
a beautiful good shit I just don't think
the matchsticks are one of them you know
oh I like so blushy
okay guys so now for highlighter what
we're gonna use I'm gonna take the Y
cell to shit Colette and because that is
like the most brightening concealer that
I have and like when I when you blend it
out has like little sparkles of glitter
in it so I'm like you know what let me
just use that as like highlighter
because like that's like all I got you
know like that's just really it's
literally the most glowy concealer that
I own did you guys see any difference
probably not probably not this is gonna
be one of those looks that's just like
real matte and real editorial you know
really contoured really this is okay ooh
that's a queen honey this is gonna be a
bitch to take off just so we're all
aware just so you guys know I dunno it's
gonna be a bitch to dig up you guys what
are we thinking do we think that we look
great or do we think Manny you done
fucked up sweetie
and you need to find another career
what's this tea here hmm cuz honestly I
don't think it looks that bad mm-hmm I
don't you know I think I couldn't been
it could have been a lot worse
well we just said it just to be evil to
myself let me just do that
let's set the whole thing in place so I
can't move mmm yummy just translucent
powder so we don't fuck up the color at
all of anything okay in the kinda hang
it's fine you know it's for the video
it's for the gigs so now that we have
the base done we have the face on this
is the face we're gonna go ahead and do
the brows now this is the part I was a
little scared about I'm not gonna lie I
was a little nerve we're gonna be taking
the Urban Decay all nighter concealer in
the shade extra deep neutral literally
the darkest shade I could find in this
and we're gonna do our brows with it
because I have very very dark brows as
we can see and I'm like
this is like a chocolaty warm around
like I was saying earlier like there's
literally like not a lot of cool toned
concealers and I buy it a lot I mean
like fucking any we're gonna try to do
I'm so sorry are you joking like how am
I gonna do this how am I going to pull
this off I'm not a redhead like I'm just
not a redhead I'm not that girl
Jesus okay let's take a little bit of
maybe we can make some of Kylie yeah
okay you guys what is happening here
what is happening the more I blend these
colors the more warm it gets are you
joking
like is this an actual joke are we being
serious because that was shit hmm okay
you know what we're not gonna scream and
we're not gonna cry about it it is what
it is this is our red brow and we're
going to live with that okay let's go
ahead and outline the brow because we
want to make sure this brow stays
beautiful in place and we want to make
sure that it's beautifully clean now
we're gonna use what to outline it
concealer you know with it being
outlined and carved out and cleaner
it looks better but I still hate it you
know okay you guys so now for the part
that I have been dreading the most we
have to do our eye makeup with fool
conceal if I'm gonna take this whole
palette right here no we're just didn't
go in we're just gonna do a full I think
I'm gonna do like a cut crease got half
cut crease like I do normally like I've
done like so many times before oh god oh
god oh god oh god okay you know what
okay it's okay
pretending to cream or he's gonna put it
all over you do we just need to think
logically and we will be fine beautiful
brown smokey eye I'm gonna blend out
those edges really we're gonna blend
them all away with the book I wanna take
a little bit about Kylie color again and
put that by the lashline ooh
do it just come down come down like
technically do you want me sickening if
you think you could like use this as a
base um if you want to do a smoky eye
that's like a black smokey eye or a
brown smokey eye why not put down
concealer first if you just happen to
have a deeper concealer around and
you're thinking yeah I don't really use
that for my under eye but what if you
can use it for your
Arius my onto something here hmm in
order to keep it looking fresh and
sickening oh my god these are so pic
Kylie your pigmented to calm your tits
we're gonna get some okay it's like an
easy super easy blend oh my goodness do
guys like it do you like it I'm going a
little crazy you know I'm just saying
okay do you want a gag I was going to
bed because of work at 6:00 a.m. every
single day and the last day out to bed
at 7:00 at 7:00 in the morning I know I
know
what was that fuck was that oh my god
it's like a mess what I pick a lighter
concealer and just concealed underneath
the concealer Oh too much to think about
look infused to eye concealers all
starting to mesh and it's getting become
messy
why is this actually so much harder than
it needs to be I feel like I'm making
this harder you guys I just want you all
to know that I'm a little disappointed
in myself right now I really shouldn't
have tried to do a smokey eye and I
should have just done a cut buck
increased like I said I should that's
we're doing fucking we're gonna carve
this out like we've never ever carved
something out before that yes
keep that in place you guys we set with
powder and then we keep it moving
okay I would keep it moving boom boom
boom boom boom powder powder powder
powder let's be honest with ourselves
that's nothing a lot better let's
highlight that inner corner and the brow
bone you know for cream concealer I'm
not hitting it that I thought was going
to you know so this is what we have so
far okay now before we finish the other
eye off of camera what we're gonna do is
we're do some eyeliner and we're gonna
see if this works we're gonna take that
same color that put on my brows or as my
eyeliner shade
and there we have it you guys we have an
eyeliner of concealer
okay now I'm gonna go finish the other
eye off of camera and put some lash done
and we'll be right back okay guys the
eyes are on they are done honestly
they're not too tragic you know it is
what it is we're using a full face using
only concealers and I think that for
just using only concealers I did a
pretty good bangin job and I honestly
like how it looks could be nicer yeah I
know
you know so now we are on to lips and we
will be officially done with today's
video I'm nervous with this this is the
part was the most like oh fuck you pick
the most fuck me of all the fuck knees
in this it's the lips okay mmm how pill
is that okay we're gonna to make some
shades of this piece I want to make like
a custom nude okay um that looks sick no
I can't allow that to happen and you
know we're gonna take the brown actually
yeah we're gonna take we're gonna take
the brown okay I've been doing
everything with this bar this is the
morphe m15 8 by the way in case you guys
are wondering now we're gonna take a
little bit of the lighter one in the
center and then we'll take a little bit
of the douchey clay in this hand here
the very very very center of that
damn bitch those are some fucking DSL d
ass motherfucking else and there we have
it we have the entire face done

concealer when we think you guys what do

challenge I know it's fucking hard as
tits but we got it there okay guys and
that is it for today's video we did a
full face using only concealer and this
is what turned out to be it's a very
warm it's very like unique unique is
definitely the right word this is my
hand PES my palette of mixing bullshit
but anyways you guys I had honestly so
much fun doing that it's so fun to do
challenges because that's whole point of
me is that it's a challenge it's
actually kind of hard to do and it's
kind of tests your skills a little bit
and if you guys ever want to if it's
kind of mess around and play around and
play with makeup and just see what you
can and can't do or just wanna things
