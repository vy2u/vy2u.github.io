today's video is going to be a fun
summer glam this is my go-to summer look
that I literally do every single year
cuz it's so easy so simple and it's just
so pretty and I have not done a summer
look in so long well Larry since last
 summer so that's uh in a minute
I have so much new stuff in PR that I
really wanted to try out but still doing
the same exact techniques that I was
doing a before so that's all we're gonna
be doing today is a brand new using new
makeup summer pretty look I love doing
like a bright lip with a really bronzy
smokey eye and I think it's so pretty
it's so summer it's so just glam I think
it works with so many different skin
tones so yeah guys that's a sales video
is going to be as always if you guys
don't like this view if you guys do not
like me
please don't watch it you know
the drill with that but you guys do like
this video please subscribe to my
channel if you're not already and if
renew what's up at man um you a and
welcome to my channel thank you so much
for being here I really appreciate it oh
yeah let's go and get into this summer
bronzy glow a skin tutorial okay guys so
first things first I am very oily you
guys know this so I'm gonna be using a
smoothing primer one has silicone in it
to really help absorb the oils on my
skin I'm gonna be glowy today but I
don't want I want to be glowing in the
areas that I want to be glowy so we're
gonna take a little bit of the make up
forevers smoothing primer we're just
gonna put that all over the skin mostly
in the t-zone just to cover up the
poorest areas
mommy's a man so she has some more so
because it's summer doesn't mean I don't
like to add some coverage a lot people
are like oh my god I want you like a
natural glowy skin look and I've seen so
many of those floating around don't get
me wrong I think it's a beautiful but
I'm not the queen to do the like
no don't makeup me go huh like no I need
 I want we're gonna of course
focus it on the areas I need more
coverage like the t-zone and the cheeks
and then I'm actually gonna mix it to
give it more of a glowy finish them take
Vela Mara soft liquid fluid you do not
have to use this as an expensive ass on
they shouldn't use any other foundation
that you have that's more of a glowy
skin like finish on a morphe m-43 nine
and i'm just going to lightly press that
over this and start to blend the
foundation as you can see the coverage
is still high but the finish is starting
to look a little bit more natural and a
lot more pretty rather than being just
full coverage and matte
I feel like for summer and it's so so
nice you guys are going with at
arc-shaped tape concealer any kind of
full coverage concealer works
fantastically I want to keep the
coverage same like I was saying earlier
in the t-zone specifically and we're
gonna blend that out
best sponge guys by the way I'm
so accessed Hollywood's actually here
right now and hope everyone watching me
and I feel like I'm a lab rat I
was giddy so now we have the base at
where we want it to be I'm going to set
areas that I want to specifically set
I'm gonna take a little bit the RCM
ain't no color powder and set underneath
my eyes because I don't want anything to
move right here so we're gonna go and
set it into strategic places like
underneath eye is for me
I just set on to these smile lines above
my lip click it holy there a little bit
on the sides of the nose and a touch on
the tip of it my chin in my forehead
center my foreheads specifically with
the RCM a powder because it is a setting
powder but it's not a heavy setting
powder so we're sunset in those areas
specifically now I'm gonna take the
medium golden mac mineralize skinfinish
and this is a really pretty skin like
powder but it is a little bit darker
than my own complexion so I want to kind
of use that and cheat the system and set
the rest of my face using a skin like
powder and it's a little bit darker so
it doesn't give me a nice just glowy
glowy look as you can see it's like
slightly darker than my own complexion
but it's not like crazy or it looks like
bitch or orange you know I'm sayin so
we're gonna go ahead and just put that
into the perimeters of the face areas I
did not set with the RC me powder
pull those of my cheeks to bronze up the
skin I would say the Marc Jacobs tan
tastic bronzer on that same morphe - I'm
gonna run that a little bit over that
mineralized skinfinish to give me more
of a intense bronzy look okay so now I'm
gonna take the apricot in the middle
blush by wet-and-wild a lot of people
have been telling me to try out the
other Wet n Wild blushes and I'm like
okay great because I love pearlescent
pink you guys know I'm obsessed on a
morphe for I was gonna run a little bit
of that or the bronzer you check areas
because I don't want to be too pink
since this look is more of a summary
bronzy glow a look I want to keep it
really like peachy and really like
bronzy essentially this blush is really
pretty because it has like a slight
subtle sheen so now guys of course the
important part of a summer glowy look is
going to be the glow obviously so I'm
gonna be taking these Stila heavens hue
highlighter and honestly Laura raves
about this so much I've never really
tried it so I'm like okay I'm gonna try
it out see how it looks I want to kind
of pile it on top of other ones so this
is a cream highlighter it's like a putty
highlighter she have to did a video in
this and I'm gonna take this on a morphe
white 10 Laura have to okay so you're
dead to me that's actually freaking
stunning alright then so this one you
guys we're going to put this on the high
points of the face of course and then
we're gonna go over top of this with an
actual powder highlighter if you guys
want to if you guys don't have to if you
don't want to but because I'm extra I'm
right down the center of the nose is
blinding I'm going to take a little bit
of the jeffree star cosmetics Siberian
gold highlighter and dust a little bit
of that on top of this just to set
everything slightly I'm talking like a
very very subtle amount just have a
powder over top a great way to look
super glowy and intense is piling on
creams and powders as you can see that
she is blinding so now we're done with
the face I'm not gonna contour my nose
I'm not gonna contour my face or any
like that this is a much more of a
natural natural as well covers can be
look for summer and I'm going to spray
my face with a pen set make sure
everything really melts into the skin
and then I'm gonna grab the same sponge
I was using earlier and press that over
this because it really ensures that the
makeup will last a long time and it
takes away any powdery appearance it's
actually really Lord showed me this
trick and after she'd showed me I was
like oh okay well you think you're
 good huh I've been doing it a
lot recently and that's it for these
skin guys glowy
still pretty natural look even though
it's full coverage as hell like I just
think that the skin looks really really
pretty and life like so now I'm gonna go
do my brows off of camera because that
takes so long and I'll be right
back
okay guys we have the brows on it now
and this is what they look like but I'm
gonna go ahead and start on the eyes are
gonna be really really easy today
actually so the main thing is using a
premie eyeliner and I'm gonna put that
all over the lid and blend that out
because this is going to be more of a
like shimmery smokey bronzed look we're
gonna take this Marc Jacobs eyeliner in
the shade ro Koko okay so now I'm gonna
take that I'm gonna put that all over
actually we're drip it down on the lash
line first like really close to the lash
line guys right there as you can see it
took a really pretty deep bronzy brown
about halfway up to the crease like that
and we're gonna blend that out really
really lightly it's just a really easy
way to make a smoky eye happen without
trying like way too hard now anything
more feat 25b palette this is a really
pretty bronzy palette I'm gonna get
really pretty shimmery copper right
there as you can see was that right over
this see that put that a little bit
farther up then the base shade and now
we're going and we're actually gonna
start blending out the entire thing so
we're gonna take any transitioning
shades that you guys might like to use
in the crease either way any of them
work
I'm just not putting them into the
crease so we can blend out this bronzy
look and this is just really you guys
this is really not a look that's like so
polished and so pretty this is just kind
of like a fun quick bronzy eye it's
super easy
take a couple colors bring it out
slightly and like call it a day it's
super super easy so not take a larger
fluffy brush don't take these light
shades right here we're gonna blend out
that darker shade so it blends out into
a nice easy seamless transition just for
some fun I'm gonna add a little bit of
this shimmery taupe B shade right on top
in the center still looks smoky and
intense the brightens it up just to give
you a little bit more dimension as you
can see right there
now I'm take the same eyeliner blend
that in the waterline
one that with the same bronzer color
okay guys so this is that final I look
what you should have super easy super
pretty just nice metallicky bronze look
I'm gonna do some eyelashes off of
camera I'll click and I'll be right back
okay guys so this is what the final I it
looks like it's just a really easy
really pretty just natural Naturals all
right where does it it's very very
wearable it's smoky and kind of like um
and gives you that like pop but it's not
like crazy black smokey eye so I think
it's a really really fun way to
integrate something sultry or something
that's not as intense so that's kind of
we did I added a pair of Lily lashes at
Miami you can use code mani anyway if
you guys want to to save some money on
it but I absolutely love this pair of
lashes cuz they really open up the eye a
lot so now we're going onto with the lip
and then we'll be done so I'm gonna take
the UH Nastasia Beverly Hills strawberry
liquid lipstick I love doing a really
really bold intense lip during the
summertime it's like why not why not
really go there this is like the time to
do it I'm not wearing this yet so uh
yeah stunning
and yet guys this is the final look this
is what it turned out to be I think the
lip looks so pretty with this really
bold intense eye I just think the whole
thing is really really fun it's very
summer this is like a really fun a
summer night out kind of look it's gonna
really make your colored eyes pop if you
do have colored eyes and I think it
turned out great I absolutely love it
the lip is also a very very nice medium
toned I don't know how to describe this
color honesty it's like a bright coral
it's a little drying I'm not gonna lie
it feels a little dry on the lips for
sure I wish you were a little more
moisturizing butter than that I think
the color is fantastic
yeah you guys that's advertising video
of course I will leave everything linked
down below as I always do it because
have fun and have an amazing amazing
summer I love you so much no greater
than I or day wherever you guys are and
I will catch you guys in my next video

different 10-10-10 makeup artists

know a lot of people are like man you
can you like the kiss and I'm like what
kiss like many more oh my god
