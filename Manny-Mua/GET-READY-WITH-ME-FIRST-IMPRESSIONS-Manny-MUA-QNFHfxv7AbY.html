today's video is going to be a full-face
get ready with me / first impressions I
have not used basically any of these
products I'd use maybe like one or two
so I was like you know what let's just
do a full face first impressions let's
just like try all the out so that's
what we did today I just did a full face
get ready with me I haven't done to get
ready in so long and I just felt like
it's been so long since I've actually
sit down and chitchat with you guys and
just kind of chilled and laid back and
just did makeup for fun and not like
having to go anywhere after after this I
can just take off my makeup and be good
you know what I mean and it's been a
minute since I've had the opportunity to
do that so I'm very excited about that
I hope everyone's having an amazing 2017
so far it's only been a month I know but
it started out great for me so far so
I'm hoping and giving you guys all this
positivity and love that's starting out
amazing for you guys as well and I hope
that the Year continues to be amazing
it's gonna be a great year for us as
long as we're putting out that good
energy into the world it's gonna be
great and that's what its gonna
be but yeah guys I'm gonna go and start
this video as always if you guys want
this video you guys don't like me please
don't watch it you know the
drill with that don't watch if
you don't like it that's just what it is
if you don't like me don't watch
me yeah but if you guys like this video
please give it a like and subscribe to
my channel if you aren't already and
yeah let's gonna get into this a
full-face get rid okay guys we're gonna
start this video with no makeup on
obviously I'm gonna be doing a full face
get ready with me using products that
I've never really tried before or
products are just brand new that I
really have been wanting to try so we're
gonna go and start on today's invader
so first things first we're gonna be
taking this new product I've actually
used this product before though and I
 love it this is the h2o Beauty
aqua defense shielding Matra facial
essence so basically this spray house
talked to me creates a barrier on your
skin to help against environmental
stressors which would be like smog
things like that would affect your skin
in a bad way like making your skin more
wrinkly more oily breakout I actually
use this when I fly which I love it for
because when you're finding a plane like
that air is recycled and it's gross it
has a lot of bacteria so I'm like no no
no no so we're gonna use this as matcha
green tea extract in it which is what
allows for the environmental blockage so
refreshing that green tea extract man
let's just good so once that's settled
in we're gonna be taking the milk makeup
blur stick which I've heard so many good
things about everyone chooses forever
basically it's a blurring
and I'm assuming it's like portal it's a
poor feeling stick so I'm just gonna put
this on my skin and I am playing it
correctly and then I think you rub it in
after okay actually do notice a blurring
effect which is kind of odd I really
didn't expect to notice a blurring
effect what uh-uh
 what do you think you guys see a
blurring effect on my face like it's a
very subtle subtle boring effect but I
do notice it like I think it looks a
little bit more flat a little more like
blurred I suppose so now we'd be taking
the Loreal total cover makeup this is
like their newest foundation I believe
they just released in the shade 303 I
grabbed that much I don't know I
actually don't I never used before I
don't know how much is enough come on
you hear a line going in I wish I could
take off this hat God soon I
will be able to not wear a hat in videos
I'm so excited to be able to actually
have hair growth take that on a morphe
six take a little kabuki brush and we're
gonna try to put this on to total
coverage was not a false claim
Oh bitch oh bitch l'oreal coming through
with the phone dude l'oreal for nations
so good and then I'm taking the morphe
one of the new morphe sponges this is
the morphe stiletto sponge look at that
 I feel whenever I go with the brush
on the nose it never looks very good so
now we're going with the new concealer
I've never tried this is the Golani cuz
sealer and the shade number ten I don't
really know much about this brand I know
that they are in the Ipsy glam back in
our generation beauty and some seen use
this concealer on my under eye I
recently did a little some some with
them with someone that they're
collaborating with which will be
announced very very very soon but I've
never used any of their products before
so this is me the first time I'm using
anything and see the coverage let's see
how this works
come on stiletto I'm so scared to put
myself in the eye with this this
concealer is a medium coverage really
really pretty finished so it gives you a
beautiful beautiful finish holy but
I will be having to go in with the more
concealer and just add some more
coverage I'm a full cat right so we
taking a little bit this Tarte shape
tape closest to the lash line just to
knock out some of that darkness just
right there yeah right there even though
I'm nervous I'm going to put my eye with
this a Beauty Blender
you cannot deny that it goes up right to
the lashes like right there now
to set our entire face we're gonna be
taking a new product the Becca soft
light blurring powder when I
I'm filming up like a full face first
impressions kind of video or I could get
ready with me I'm like homie don't
me when something says it's a blurring
powder I'm into it the weird thing about
this power is that it looks colored like
this looks like a colored power doesn't
look very very translucent so I'm a
little nervous
we'll see that's a color that is a
 color is this a joke honestly
it's a joke okay where she can
actually use have to uses powder all
over the face to match my under eyes now
um go everywhere Louis I'm not happy
about this I mean we made it work okay I
feel like we made it work enough where
the whole entire face is now a shade
that matches but I'm a little annoyed I
thought okay let me see maybe I just
read the claims wrongly read it again
soft light burning powder Golden Hour is
that the shade golden hour is on
translucent well I just heard that wrong
um but it was only it's only one powder
I didn't know that there was several so
far though on my skin I don't really
like the way the becca powder is looking
it looks really heavy okay that's what
it just looks really really really
really heavy and I'm usually okay with
heavy powders but this looks really
really heavy it doesn't look like Laura
Mercier one it doesn't look like the RCM
a when it just looks so much heavier
than that in person I have to try it
tomorrow but right now so far I don't I
don't like it we're gonna grab another
new Breanna this is from Pixie this is
the pixie and Miriam maquillage strobe
and bronze palette so pixie and Miriam
akaash aka
Miriam NYC collaborated so proud of you
Miriam if you ever see this video I'm so
proud of you for collaborating with them
Pixies a humongous brand and I can't
wait to see your face and freaking drug
stores in student so I'm gonna use a
bronzer in this I touched them already
and honestly smooth is I was
honestly shook a little bit I'm never I
never tried any pixie products I
literally am never have so I'm like okay
like I'm like nervous I might need that
much or a just a little bit I'm taking
it on e too
like pigmented all that is
pretty that's a pretty color blendable
is hell - come on Miriam come on pixie
 that is a pretty ass bronzer color
holy crap I'm very much impressed and
they also have a highlighter here so
might as well use a highlighter right
now - they're already here
there's three of them here and I'm
assuming I'm gonna go with the lightest
one because that's probably mostly my
shade I'm taking morphe M 510 classic
mani and we're gonna load up this
highlighter hmm especially for being
drugstore girl and very iridescent it's
like a really pretty soft like almost
lilac e pink color I feel so far I'm
very impressed with this palette
I'm very impressed
okay I'm gonna put in here now let's go
in with some blush I feel so
bronzed today holy crap so I've never
tried on these buses before I even wanna
try one for a minute this is the clinic
cheek pop and the shade pink honey pop I
just saw this color and I was like oh
like it looked really really really
really pretty and I've heard great
things about the little cheek pops so
I'm like let's pop this
let's pop my cherry so we're
gonna go and put that in the blush areas
with my morphe for oh that is a
beautiful color take a rosy pink color I
was like what are you Oh bitch is
looking ethereal huh so now
we're taking a little bit of that same
aqua defense matcha setting spray
sprayed onto the skin to melt everything
in it is also a refreshing mist so I'm
hoping that it'll take away some of the
powdery look of my face right now
please matcha green tea work with me
here so definitely looks a lot less
powdery on the skin looks way way better
after using a setting spray thank God
we're think we're done with the face
that's below so basically I had nothing
new for the brow so I just did the brows
off of camera cuz it's one faster and to
add nothing new for it so I'm like you
know what it I'm just gonna do the
brows off of camera I'm very handsy I'm
sorry I'm very new when it comes to eyes
we have the new color pop shadows the
pressure a does not have pressure arrows
which is so cool but the UH pressure
does not just like the cream shots what
they have which of course are fantastic
already put them all into a palette so
we're gonna go from here when it colors
this is like three grand bel-air looks
like a nice neutral transition I haven't
riding it by the way and not try them at
all so going into them right now oh my
gosh way darker on the brush then
I thought it was I'm actually have to
mix this one in with a little bit of a
lighter color hear me out I'm gonna mix
it in with that one a little bit because
that was way darker than I thought
was me okay
no presenter the creases see how they go
in and how they blend whoo I notice
right away that the pigmented like boom
pigment right away
awesome oh yeah they're pigmented I
guess I kind of go in softly with these
 goes d-27 by the way
taking that same brush and I'm going
with this little palette this is like
one of the pre-made palettes I don't
know exactly what it's called to go with
the orange and going with a little bit
of that like a muted yellow shade I'm
gonna put that into the crease as well
just give it some more depth and
dimension just give it a nice fun life
to the look I always feel like oranges
and yellows like muted colors always
give a nice pretty dimension to any kind
of look especially with my eye color
people clock me all the time for doing
the same looks all the time
quote-unquote same looks all the time
but honestly like it's my aesthetic man
like if I love the way something looks
and it looks good on me and it looks
like something like I love to wear why
would I not continue to do it that's
what I don't understand what you want
I'm going to events you see if I'm doing
makeup like out and about I'm going to
an event and I want to look like how I
want to look I'm not trying to no
avant-garde crazy like I'm
just not like that's just not what I'm
going for
I'm sorry if you're looking for
something like that this is all the
channel room you know these blunt
 nice these are nice I'm
really impressed especially for five
bucks come on color pop coming
through dude let's take this little dark
maroonish straight over there on a
morphine m4 three three now we're gonna
put on the outer corner and then put the
into oh that is much Pinker than I
thought was in to be holy not as
dark as I thought too
mainly on the outer corner and then I'm
just going to blend with that you've 27
again honest I was kind of going
willy-nilly I don't have a plan in my
mind with this look at all so we're just
kind of winging it we're Donald Trump in
and we're just winging it shout out to
my husband Kyle who probably will not
watch this I can definitely um say he's
my husband he just doesn't know it yet
Maya will be thing in the future son you
guys in that Orion a oh I'm just kidding
now when you actually darken it because
I didn't think that color was going to
be as bright as it was so now I'm gonna
take the shade popular demand which
seems like a deeper version of that
previous shade looks like this is like a
more chocolatey espresso color
oh yeah that's definitely deeper
if we're going smokey on the lid our
crease needs to be perfection
okay let's take a little pencil brush to
e36 and a little bit a little smidgen of
the shade cloud at 9 which is a dark
chocolatey shade and that's going to go
into the most inner part of our crease
and outer corner because we are going to
start making this a little smoky when I
start making this a little smaller and a
little bit into the crease the darker
shade I'm having a little bit more
trouble blending out than I did with the
rest of the shades I think this one's
like one of those extremely extremely
pigmented shades that you have to like
really really work on just letting you
guys know the darkest of the shade is
like whoa I need to actually work on it
for a couple minute I just saw this
color and I was like oh we're gonna
going with you for sure we're gonna take
the shade goody-two-shoes which is like
a really fun like silver gunmetal shade
and I think I wanna go all over the lid
with that one it just looks so pretty I
say why not I'm gonna take it on my
finger and most like a purple tone to it
- it's like a gunmetal black purple
that's what it's giving me
oh it's beautiful look I'm coming okay
so now we're gonna go and just blend it
between the lid color and the crease
color taking a little bit more of that
shade popular demand which is that same
really pretty brownish red looks very
espresso II and I'm gonna put that into
the crease summary a little bit on the
brush and just blend between the edges
that is sex mm-hmm we make a love to the
 camera tonight huh so we're
using that same palette again I'm gonna
take this a really light shimmery shade
and I'm going to use that on the inner
corner of my eye because this eye is
looking a little smoky which of course
is what we want but we need to open up
the eye a little bit just because I
don't want to look too closed off and
too smoky where it looks like my eyes
little uh you know Joe I love to hear I
know it sounds terrible but a lot of you
guys done I love you guys tell me that
um when I'm filming and I'm making like
sounds or whatever a lot of times your
parents will be like what the are
you watching thinking you're watching
born I apologize for that my bad
so we take the original shade that we
used earlier which is this line are any
use out on a more feet 18 we're gonna
blend that underneath the eyes taking me
to see how dark that color is like so
much darker than I thought it was in the
pan it looks so light and then you put
it on and I'm like oh that is a
 brown line ain't no
transition basically we're gonna match
the top of the eye to the bottom of the
I and we're gonna do so with layering
colors like we did originally metal
waterline we're gonna take the new Tarte
fake away pencil which is like a really
pretty nude pencil I love the Tarte
pencils like I just think they're so
nice I wanna put that in the waterline
to open up the eye a little bit more
whoo that's just screams
I've been try to get nice okay now that
we're done with the eyes is the color
scheme that I'm liking and I'm done with
this I'm gonna go and do some eyeliner
and put the mascara on off of camera and
I'll be right back
okay cool so now that we have the
mascara and lashes on I'm wearing new
bout some dragon Li not Bella for once
these are the type of lashes that go or
they're like smaller on the front and
wisp out at the end which I thought
would be great because the wings today
are gnarly so now we're gonna go
in with the lip color and I decided
because Murphy just came out with new
liquid lipsticks I'm so excited for them
because these are absolutely beautiful
on their only 13 is a 12 or 13 bucks I
don't remember exactly 12 or 13 bucks
and I'm just so impressed that a brand
could do great liquid lipsticks for such
an affordable price definitely the best
I found for $13 like come on so I'm
gonna go with the shade mood yeah
and they smell fantastic you only need
one dunk for this and this is the
lip cleaned up with some concealer on
the edges because you know when you go
in with just like a lipstick I'm never
very neat what they I'm just like and I
need to clean up with concealer always
but this is what the lip looks like I
think it's so pretty and now
guys that's it for the entire video I
hope you guys had fun watching it of
course I'll link everything down below
of what I use all these new products I'm
like I'm like really impressed with all
of these things so I'm like cool I'm not
impressed with some of them the powder

excited to see how they work out on me
