today's video is going to be a quick get
ready with me I'm going to be doing a
quick date night get read with me I'm
actually going on a date tonight and
this is the routine that I do whenever
I'm going on a date it's like a really
quick easy routine cuz I don't going on
a date I want to look really fresh and
really natural I want to be pretty much
unlockable like this is super random but
in the gate world like wearing makeup is
not seeing as something that's like so
like cool and masculine like it's not
really like that in the gay world yet
I'm hoping it'll get there soon I'm
praying so when I'm going on dates I
don't ever really wore full glam when
I'm doing a smokey eye or some crazy
glitter I'm not doing that I'm just
doing a really natural unlockable glam
on this mug so that'd be
fun because I'm going on a date tonight
and I actually go on dates pretty often
not okay not that often you guys are
thinking like oh my god man you're
 Wow I'll do like once or twice a
month and that's not that often brah
going once twice a month I think it's a
super fun it's just nice to meet new
people I don't mind asking people unday
- I don't mind getting asked on dates
I'm just like why the now and
today's actually a special video because
it is sponsored with h2o Beauty I'm
gonna be using one of their products and
this get ready with me h1 that you guys
know that I'm sponsor with them but I
absolutely love this product so
thank you to h2o I love this product so
thank you for sponsoring me in today's
video as always if you guys don't like
this video if you guys do not like me
please don't watch it you know
what you okay but you guys like this
video please subscribe to my channel if
you're not already and if we knew what's
up I'm an emu and welcome to my channel
thank you so much for being here I
really appreciate it
because going into this cute little date
night get ready with me glam and let's
do it
okay guys so first thing is at first I'm
going to hydrate my skin I like my skin
to look really plump and fresh when I'm
on a date and supple like I just look a
lot better you know what I mean so I'm
when you're taking the h2o Beauty
hydrating a booster I absolutely love
this so much as you guys can see this
little beads inside this bad boy and
these are filled with concentrated forms
of vitamin A and vitamin E to deliver a
long-lasting hydration throughout the
entire day which I thought was really
really really cool so what you do is you
mix these with serums you mix it with
moisturizers you mix it with your
foundation you can mix it with anything
if you want it to be more hydrating so
what I'm gonna do I'm gonna take
literally one to two little dollops of
this one too I'm gonna take two drops I
love it I just feel like it gives me
like really fresh plump dewy looking
skin in I just really I just really
really like it I like to mix it with my
SPF in the morning I will literally mix
this two drops of this with my SPF every
single day because I do not like the
feeling of really intense SPF like
sunscreen I hate it I literally hate it
so what I'll do is I'll add the two jobs
it makes the product glide it's so much
easier than the keeps my skin hydrated
today so yeah thank you so much to h2o
beauty for partnering with me on this
video absolutely guys this product so
much and if I was you I would definitely
definitely check it out get a sample of
it if you guys can it's good so now that
we are moisturizer down and complete
what we're gonna do is we're gonna take
a pore feeling primer I'm gonna be
taking the benefits of pore fessional
about that much and I can start it on
the center of my skin and blend it
outwards and I love using a pore filling
primer when I'm going on a date because
it's completely clear and invisible and
you can't even see it but it makes the
biggest difference in the world we're
actually trying to have a nice looking
skin I can literally tell in the mirror
right now that my pores look smaller
Neela what is X my next part of my
routine is I take the tart shape tape
concealer and I take literally the
smallest amount ever I'm taking the
shade light I do a little guy right
there in the center and I head on now
and I go on my date like this you guys
this is a quick date night get ready
this is not some type of like I'm gonna
sit in front of them here for seven
hours and get ready this is literally
like quick and easy I'm gonna put this
on my under eye what I like about the
Tarte shape tip is our little products
go such a long way
and I'm just trying to make my icicle a
bit more awake and what I like to do is
I like to really concentrate to a lot of
the concealer on the inner part of my
eye because a lot of the darkness does
hide there and I'll lure just blend it
down just a small amount looks really
really nice and it's pretty unclocked
ball bitch that's on coal lockable I'm
not trying to clock me also if you
notice that you have any intense
breakouts going on in your face I'll
play a little bit of concealer right
there just a spot conceal that's totally
great too right now I'm not too bad I
know I have like little nuggets along
the way on my face but it's not too bad
and I'm just kind of like you know so
now for the part for my face what I like
to do is I like to take v it's cosmetics
CC cream and this is the full coverage
cream SPF 50 I know it says full
coverage and that sounds intense and
you're like whoa Manny this is what to
be natural I am what I like to do
they'll take a little bit the smallest
amount ever so now I'm gonna do them
take the CC cream I'm just take a little
small amount of animal put it on at this
morphe and 439 any large kabuki brush
will work great because what you want to
do is really were just I blend it out so
it's not detectable so I'm gonna do that
I put on my cheeks Lulu time it might
not be my color huh
hmm it's all good we're gonna blend so
we're gonna do is gonna put on the
center of the cheeks and we're going to
blend into the temples without giving
too much coverage a little bit on the
nose and I really love this it CC cream
because it gives you a really lifelike
appearance but covers up a little bit
like it covers up enough but it doesn't
make it look like you have any makeup on
I don't know how they do it I don't know
how they do it I'm like shook and as you
can see it just gives you a little
little a bit of coverage we have to use
the smallest amount and blend it out
really nicely with the kabuki it gives
you like a really really even coverage
on your skin it's not too intense I
really really really like this so now
what I'm going to do is I'm gonna set
the under-eye specifically because most
of the times skin has a more dewy skin
like appearance it's not like match
that's a little more like bitch or
invoking making furniture so I'm gonna
take a little bit of the RCM a no color
powder because this is a great powder
for people that are more dry and it's
more of an undetectable powder and I'm
taking on a brush now I'm gonna sponge
no no sponge because that is
much more like oh you're baking
today huh so we're gonna do is I'm gonna
set under eye from the backwards going
in Jack no more sanding with this powder
so as you guys can see right now the
face is pretty natural-looking it's not
too intense but you have a little bit of
coverage you get a little bit of a nice
complexion we're doing good
 learn huh so now we're gonna go
ahead and take a little bit of bronzer
I'm talking like a smidgen a smidgen
we're gonna take the Physicians Formula
butter at bronzer we're just gonna do a
little quick quickness mm-hmm or take a
little bit on the cheeks huh just a
little bit of mmm dimension as you guys
can see on my skin too it doesn't look
completely matte it definitely has a
skin like appearance which I want to
keep it out I don't want it to make it
look too Clocky so this is
basically gonna keep my face out guys
this is exactly what I how I keep my
face I don't do too too too much past
this now I'm gonna go and work on the
brows what I do is I'll grab a tinted
brow gel
I do not grab like a brow pencil I won't
grab like anything too intense I'll lay
just got my tinted brow gel this is from
anastacio I love her brow gel so
much I should use gorilla glue goddamn
I'm gonna go and just run because it
will give you a little bit of coverage
in color and make your brows look a
little fuller and thicker as you can see
right there boom what I like about using
a brow chose that once it dries down it
looks super super natural and it looks
like your brows are really really
groomed and nice and they're just more
full so now we're gonna do is I'm gonna
curl up my lashes this is an important
part of my date night process cuz bitch
my lashes go straight down so much cuter
with curl lashes
yeah I just look away god damn
die on it pinch myself to just curl the
lashes a little bit make them look a
little bit lifted not so mmm what I'll
do now is I'll take a mascara any
mascara works I try to stick with brown
mascara but I don't know where I put my
last brow mascara so I'm just kinda like
 it I'm gonna do is take this little
mascara I'm gonna literally like press
against my lower lashes I'm just giving
my little some-something
not to show that I'm wearing mascara but
just so that my lower lashes aren't as
neglected because I feel like they get
neglected a lot you know now that I'm
done with basically the faces all I can
do I'll take a little bit like a colored
cloth I'm talking like a smidgen this is
a NYX gloss in the shade that tiramisu
like a little like uh huh like four
little dots does it give me a little bit
of color a little bit of glossiness just
of my lips like really plump and healthy
let's see that dude you guys I'm getting
some big tonight come on I'm just
kidding I just wanted a look more plump
and just more supple and more like look
at your lips pretty and that's it you
guys this is it for the entire date
night get ready with me love this is why
I like to keep my face I I don't like to
overdo it I just wanna keep my face
looking really really natural but yet
corylus and as nice as I can possibly
make it you know this is me really
enhancing my natural features as they
are I'm not really doing too much I was
