as you can see today's video is going to
be a tutorial on yeah fucking fly a
tutorial on this eye look and this whole
face look I have going on right now I
really want to do a very very pretty
glowy skin type of tutorial with a nice
bronzy intense eye because we are
getting into summer I've been really
inspired by like summer trends like
glowing skin and bronzy skin and just
really coppery smoky type of eyes and I
really want to incorporate that into a
look and this is what I came up with and
I think it's not so freaking pretty feel
like my face looks very healthy and
glowy and not too intense
it doesn't look really I don't feel like
I look oily whatsoever but it just looks
glowy and healthy and I think it turned
out so beautifully and the eyes I went
to do a halo eye which I've not done in
so long and since I had this palette the
Laura Lee and violet vos palette I'm
like you know what let me go and
incorporate this palette in today's look
and this is what I came up with I just
can't wait to keep going with summer
makeup looks I just think there's so
much fun and I'm really into summer
times right now and I've been doing very
very bold looks on my eyes recently all
my the past loads have been bold on the
eyes have you guys noticed that the last
one I did that wasn't bold was like the
Urban Decay one but that's just I was
doing a one burn tutorial but all the
other ones I've been doing the beauty
color palette tutorial was bold the
freakin white eyeliner drugstore
tutorial bold everything has been bold
on the eyes recently so I'm gonna try to
do more bold lip looks and more chill
eye looks but yeah so as always if you
guys want this video if you guys don't
like me please don't fucking watch it
you know the drill with that but if you
guys do like this video and you guys do
like me please like this video and
subscribe to my channel if you want
already and if you're new what's up I'm
an emu a and welcome to my channel thank
you guys for being here I love you so
much maniac family
yes let's go and get into this full face
glowy skin and bronzy eyes tutorial
okay guys let's go and get started on
this a full-face video I want to do the
full things today because I thought I've
been doing full-faced recently a lot
more and you guys seem to like that so
I'm wrecking to you on with this bull
face video kind of one for more of a
summary kind of glow on the skin rather
than being too like intense map full
coverage so that's we're doing today on
the skin and I have the perfect products
for to start with I recently just got
the nataschab de NOLA glow kit it's like
a whole entire kit Thank You beauty list
for setting it to me I've heard such
good things about the Natasha Genoa
shadows but I never heard anything about
the face product so I'm like let me try
this out right now first impressions
hello
so Ragini's a whole entire kick Ziggler
he has everything like primer
highlighter foundation just so my goal
with that okay at this point we're gonna
just go fucking with it okay so it's one
prime the skin first so we're gonna take
the magic primer anti-shine flawless
base by Natasha don't obviously cuz it's
done like a and we're gonna put that all
over the skin see the first time using
it anyone try to get hmm
just start down the center of the face
and blend it outwards because I am going
for more of a glowy skin look today I do
want to be matte underneath my
foundation because I'm so fred was
robbing do our I do get oily throughout
the day in order trying to be smart it's
still sticky
there's glycerin in the store gonna take
me Natasha Nona basic glow foundation
SPF 15 and where's you put all the skin
I have the shade 40 I do appreciate that
it's in a pump mmm I'm gonna take down a
Real Techniques Beauty butter type
sponge situation and pounce that all
over the skin how's the coverage I
haven't read this yet so we'll see how
it is oh this is definitely more of a
luminous dewy glowy foundation thank
gosh I did the like mattifying base
because again I am oily
oh well we can make it work for sure cuz
it does cover very nicely it's looking
very pretty very do very glowy
like sunscreen mm-hmm if you are more on
the dry combo side I think you're gonna
really love this foundation because it
gives you a still nice full coverage but
it ends up being glowy and luminous
rather than being too drying at all on
the skin it literally gives you like a
luminous finish my face feels very
luminous I feel like a little tin can at
this point so we're gonna go with this
I'm gonna take the Urban Decay Naked
weightless concealer in the shade light
neutral I'm not just gonna go in like
area that I need a little more help with
hmm and in the shade fair in neutral I'm
gonna take that a little bit lower and
start to highlight with it as well
we're gonna be so glowy today it's not
even funny like bitches are gonna wish
they were this glowy uh mm-hmm mm-hmm
I feel like I'm like a Rorschach test
like that like in blooding test that's
how I feel I know go and blend out with
the same Real Techniques Beauty Blender
type sponge ooh
I am amazing so now that we have
everything down the concealer is down
I'm looking quite non-dimensional I'm
gonna take a new morphe brush that I
just came out with this is the new gun
metal collection brush this is in the
number g37 it's like a cute little
tapered brush and I just wanted to try
that with the powder and see how that
would work underneath my eyes I'll go
ahead and set that eye with it these
brushes are so soft
Oh morphine why do you do me good like
this every time you do me every time
just add a little bit more of the highly
I'm gonna take the Natasha Genoa glow
face cream and just add a little bit
mm-hmm Moving's doing fucking idiot I'm
shitting add a little bit to the tops of
the cheekbones just to give me a little
bit of a base for a highlighter and I
like to do this before I do the powder
because it's gonna be nice just base for
other powder highlighters I'm gonna be
going on with look at this glow though
stop it's a really pretty base okay I
mean I mean you try to say this in my
first time I really really like that
cream base Wow okay but when you're
happily surprised I like that I like
that and then we're going to set the
rest of the face with Laura Mercier
translucent that's why I put underneath
my eyes and I'm doing to that on the
powder puff it's very important if you
are oily on the more oily side you want
to set the center of the face if you're
using more voluminous dewy foundation
because you do want to be able to still
be Dewey and luminous throughout the day
rather than being so oily and like an
oil slick so wear a nice heavy amount of
powder on the t-zone areas that you
really don't want to be too glowy
right underneath the highlighting areas
and then on the center of the part as
well because I do get pretty oily on the
for whatever I left on the little powder
puff I'm just going to dab a little bit
around the edges of my forehead as well
go into some powder down your neck or
liquid whatever you want to do if you
want take your liquid foundation down
your neck that is totally fine
to take powder foundation down my neck
just cuz I don't like to take a liquid
down my neck very often if you guys
didn't watch me for a while you guys
know this I was taking Mac Studio Fix
powder because it covers nicely and then
gives you a nice amount of color so I'm
a little sweaty
Lord Jesus make me a raindrop okay so
I'm gonna go ahead and finish off with
the face now I have everything set the
last step of the Natasha Genoa glow kit
is that guy take a little highlighter
Laurie says mint oxygen on a glow all
over face glow I don't know I'm gonna
take on the same morphe g37 it looks
like it's a nice tapered brush so might
as well use it for a little bit of
highlight i think i'm assuming it just
like a little higher so it's going to
load this bitch up just to add a little
bit more of a sheen i think yeah i think
this is definitely a little bit more of
a sheen to the face rather than being
too heavy just more of a natural glow
the kit comes with the body glow but
we're not using that because I don't do
body glow I don't know all this I don't
know all that I'm gonna take the Marc
Jacobs tantric bronzer one of my
all-time all-time all-time favorite
bronzers alive it's so good on a morphe
- such a nice bronzer I'm going to
bronze up the edges of my face so you
have nice bronzy skin right now I love
this bronzer so good taking that same
morphe brush i'm this is like the only
brush I use today what the hell we
should clean up the under parts with
that same studio fix powder by Mac just
cleaning up the under part of that
bronzer just so it doesn't look really
muddy really intense because I'm not
gonna contour I just wanna keep it
bronzy and glowy and you control this
nose because this nose is not having it
you're not having it this nose is not
having it at all so I'm going to do my
normal nose contouring routine I'm gonna
take be more feet you 28 brush and they
make a geek break-up cool porcelain
contour shade and I'm shooting to
contour my nose a little bit and let's
kill me today I get version of contra
nose is actually my favorite nose
contouring brush of all time because
it's tapered and fluffy so it gives you
like this like really nice precise line
but it also blends out very very nicely
so because you're ever interested in a
really really good nose contouring brush
the e 28 is fucking ridiculously good
and once I snatched it to its fullest
ability at this point I'm going to take
a little morphe 458 brush and just
snatch the sides and go ahead and just
cook the sides of the contour to make it
more of a sharp clean line I like to do
this when I'm contouring my nose because
just gives me more of a clean appearance
after it's like reverse contouring with
powder put little bit on the center of
the nose let's go I just let that cook
and settle in while we add blush to the
face okay I'm very excited about it so
I'm gonna be taking the Becca X jacket
he'll champagne glow collection palette
I'm so proud of Jacqueline for
continuing on the champagne pop
collection with Becca it's just such a
cool thing to see like Jacqueline I
think was like the first youtuber inside
Sephora to be working with such a huge
brand like Becca and maybe she really
liked bust down the doors for other
youtubers to be inside Sephora and just
to be recognized and more of a global
way rather than just being like on
YouTube so it's such a really really
cool thing to see that and now that
they're expanding on the line it's just
so amazing and I'm so proud of jacked
and then this palette are you joking
it's absolutely beautiful and it's
stunning and I just it's so good and the
mirror is awesome the mirror is
absolutely amazing I'm obsessed like I'm
so proud of her like I can't even I love
you jack than I love you so we're gonna
do some of the blushes here I think I'm
gonna literally mix like I think I might
take a row spritz and amaretto mix on a
morphic III brush and just apply that on
the cheekbones just give me I'm nice
like flush of color
oh that's mushroom picking mm well okay
so we're just gonna make it work you're
gonna make it fucking work okay I
learned like this I Depp very pigmented
it's absolutely beautiful like it's
absolutely stunning
just be prepared for the pigmentation
that will come with that little tiny dab
oh so now that I have the blush on it
looks good i blended it and I put a
little bit of translucent powder on my
brush just buffed it into the skin so I
think it looks not so intense I'm just
gonna brush off the extra powder that I
have on my skin on my nose I'm gonna go
add a little bit of that face glow
powder again just a little bit on the
nose
just give me some glow back to the skin
on the nose
smash that nose to death you just do
okay cool so now we're done with the
face I'm gonna go and continue on with
the eyes okay great so I went ahead and
I did my brows and primed my eyes off of
camera just gonna take some time that
you guys probably don't want to see it I
will be doing an updated brow routine
for you guys because I love you guys did
requests for me to do one so I will be
doing one of those very very soon but so
we're gonna go in with our eyes now and
get started with this honestly like I
don't know what to do I know what
palette I want to use I want to use the
Laura Lee X violet Voss palette I don't
even know that this is out yet to be
honest I just got my PR package
literally yesterday but I have to use
this because it's so stunning this
palette is absolutely gorgeous look at
this palette so I think I'm gonna do a
halo I'd say which I have not done a
halo eye on video or just in general in
so long I love doing halo eyes - they're
so fun and really easy to follow along
with so that's ready today I'm gonna do
a smokey halo eye that sounds fucking
sexual oh yeah that's what we're doing
so I'm gonna take a more 5027 I'm gonna
take the shade pressed pot which just
sounds so funny like her name's cuz
Laura is such a like country little
bumpkin like she's from Alabama so all
of her little names are so like country
and adorable so I'm baby you're just so
cute so many thought no more for you 27
and that's gonna go into the crease all
the way in to the front of the crease I
really buff that into the crease because
we are going to be doing a halo eye and
that calls for a lot of buffing okay I
rounding a Peach Smoothie from makeup
geek actually very very raised similar
to that do these valley Voss shadows are
so nice they're really really nice
honestly they blend very nicely I think
Laura and viola wass really killed it
with this palette they did so good and I
can't wait for her to come out I love
Laura so much she's such a cool down to
earth person and I loved seeing her at
events and stuff like that and I'm
moving to LA I hope I get to see her a
lot more Laura hope I see a lot more so
not only have that down it's just a nice
very easy transition shade I'm gonna be
taking a combination of a mama bird and
a ragamuffin and that's going to go on
the inner and outer third of the eye on
the outer corner and the inner corner
and putting that into the crease
slightly about 1/3 of the way in doing
the inner third as well right into the
socket line and I'm going to do a very
light motion sweeping over the center of
that
right above my crease and interesting
that you 27 one more time blending out
those edges slightly just to make sure
there's no harsh lines and as you can
see it starting to add some definition
and depth on the inner and outer corner
thing looks very pretty okay great so
continuing on we're going to take the
shade Alabama on that same m4 thing when
you take that a little bit lower than
the other shades this is going to add
some more definition and depth this is
much more of a deeper warmer brown than
the other shades are so we're going to
take that a little bit lower than the
other shades as you can see Chad's
little more depth and dimension make
sure we're just keeping that a little
bit lower in 27 blend that out and then
to add the final aspect of some more
dimension I'm going to take the shade
bubs
and this is more of a very very just
cool tone grayish Brown and that's time
to go on a 36 and just keep that very
very precise and lowest of all the
colors I really wanted to build upon at
these colors and add colors that we're
going to be commentating each other and
then on the center of the lid I'm gonna
go ahead and add the shade Biddy which
is like a very just coppery warm copper
shade and I think it's gonna go so well
with this really cool intense I'm sure
we're tight a little I'm gonna take that
on a morphe m16 7 and I'm going to pack
that onto the brush and put that on the
center of the lid the shade is stunning
I'm gonna take it all the way up to
where I have the crease drawn on I'm
just doing patting motions because this
shadow is very pigmented and very creamy
so we'll have fallout if you don't pat
on there just blending out those edges
between the shades without em 4-3-3 and
then the top of the eye should look
something like this okay great so both
the eyes are done now I actually went
ahead off of camera I just I forgot to
show you guys I added a little bit of
hissy fit on the center of the eyes when
my finger just i dabbed a little bit on
it just to give me more of a pop in the
center of the eye so you can see as like
the copper but has the gold now and has
like all the dimension in it there's a
lot of colors going on in this eye but I
think it looks so cool because it is all
part of one palette so it's not like I'm
over here using like ninety thousand
different shades from all these like
different ranges and different brands
it's all in one palette so I just think
it's looks freakin awesome I'm gonna do
lower lashline
now and I'm just gonna do basically
write down the top transition wise on
the bottom
make a halo on the bottom I'm going to
take that same a36 in the shade mama
bird and that's gonna go on the lower
lashline and start blending that in
we're gonna keep it pretty light on the
lower lash line because the top is so
heavy so I'm gonna keep pretty light
down here so tie in the whole entire
look I really want to add this eyeliner
this is the maybelline lasting drama
waterproof gel pencil in the shade of
striking copper because this eye is much
more on the copper golden side
so why not keep it all cohesive okay I
let that work Lisa I just love it coming
up with that on the waterline it's a
very just shimmery coppery shade oh it's
very creamy everyone do like this it is
so creamy this is really gonna make my
green eyes pop whoa I'll take it oh my
gosh these are look at like hold on
they're very very pigmented and very
nice it like reminds me a liquid copper
metal and I think it looks freaking cool
it's like almost like grungy and like
you know now to highlight the inner
corner and a brow bone a little bit I'm
taking more free em three to six my
favorite inner corner and a brow bone
highlight brush of all time it's just so
tiny it's flat it's so good it's
absolutely amazing I'm gonna take the
shade sugar maybe I'll take the shade
sugar it's like it looks like a golden
like a light gold yeah without an inner
corner yeah that looks nice I like that
oh it's very bright much more bright
than I thought was gonna be looks not
that bright in the pan but it's pretty
fucking bright I like it we're gonna go
and curl my lashes apply your favorite
mascara and lashes
okay great till the eyes are done now I
went ahead and added some Serengeti
lashes buy a new Balance um and I did do
a little bit of eyeliner over the lash
line just to cover up the lash line a
little bit cuz they're just kind of
annoying me that was there so this is
what it looks like I'm gonna go and zoom
you guys in to see what they look like
up close
okay great so now that we have the face
completely done I'm gonna go ahead and
finish off with the lips now I just got
these in the mail recently these are
from makeup Atelier Paris these are the
liquid lipsticks that they have and I
saw this shade called a beige orange and
I thought that would go so well with
this look I have going on right now I
have been doing such intense bold eyes
recently like all my last tutorials I've
been like bold eyes and like subdued
neutral lips yeah I really need to get
back into doing like something more
intense on the lips
and do something more soft on the eyes
but I love doing intense eyes I think
they're so fun and like the windows of
the soul and I just fucking love them
though the nipples of the face okay the
nipples of the face so I'm gonna go
ahead and apply this makeup or to the
eight liquid lipstick in the shade be
our inge oh it's very pretty take a very
thin lightweight formula and this is the
final look
and that is it for the entire video I
hope you guys had fun watching this I
