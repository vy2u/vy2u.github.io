that behind us you're gonna meet ignore
that because it's a mess today it's
literally a nine o'clock and I am
filming a video I am saying hi hi you
guys
how you doing how's your day going how's
your night going yeah so today I decided
to film a video it is why I got picked
out I met slash kicked out of my math
experience you know I don't want this
video to turn into like a bashing of my
maths or like some like you I meant
like me I don't want to change that
might when I talk about my experience
because I got hundreds and hundreds and
hundreds of tweets Instagram comments
about why me magic got kicked out of my
mouth so I really wanna make this video
for you guys I just want to talk about
it could take a little venting slash
rant about my Mets because I just feel
like just feel the need to talk about it
so fair so it's alright if you guys all
like this kind of video
do not watch and do not watch it
I don't give a will usually don't
even trip like don't watch if you guys
like it
cool okay so what's going it started
with this video
I started okay so this will happen I'm s
just past I mention New York was there
I'm a Patrick Starr and we were there
for about five days in New York and mean
him more hired by a brand to go to New
York I met for about an hour
on Saturday we were hired to do in hell
runs already in two hours on Sunday just
to work at the booth just to kind of be
there me our followers be there with the
booth because they did fly us out to go
with them time outs so that's just a
little backstory of what was like going
on like the reason why we're at paiement
is because we were hired by a booth to
go there with them and to just to work
with them me and Patrick thought we can
make it into a Mean Green type situation
because we were already gonna be at that
booth working the brand is Julia's place
she had also hired a couple other people
from Instagram YouTube and stuff like
that to the work at the booth so we
figured might as well just turn it into
a kind of like mean greed situation
that's what we are saying me angry at
this booth that's a back story was the
only having that's gonna be so Friday
I'm at pro night so pro night me and
Patrick we were like we're not gonna go
we're gonna be on Saturday and so I need
to be full days for us we're not gonna
go to pro night we're gonna be strong
we're not gonna go probably or gonna be
really good
turns out we end up playing pro night
mm-hmm for about an hour and a half the
dough's ending at like 7:00 we went end
up getting there like 5:30 so he walked
in and we were recognized like quite a
bit we did end up moving past like 20
feet for about half an hour we were
taking photos with people and it wasn't
too bad though because it was pro night
so there's a lot less people during
pronate so you know which is pretty fun
like this is cool
we're just gonna walk around it kind of
meet brands cuz I feel like this would
be a cool time to network and meet
brands just go on a Friday and I just
got to me like a bunch of people which I
was really excited about but it was busy
and we mean bunch of work in you
recognize quite a lot there was some
sometimes a line would form but I must
didn't say anything to us they're
totally fine we weren't causing a scene
we were not causing any type of like big
situation happening like meeting us so I
was telling people time maintaining to
us and Friday was cool now cyber
Saturday funny
so basically me and Patrick were
planning on doing a meet and greet on
Saturday outside of my mats for those of
you were not inside IMS we did one in LA
it's called the red bloom you know and
it was a huge hit and it was so fun we
did it with a couple of our friends and
it was just me and Patrick this times
were like you know what it's not gonna
be too crazy it'll be fine or to meet
people are gonna meet our subscribers
and our followers that's an amazing and
I was very extremely excited as I was
Patrick like I've never been to New York
before this is the first time I was ever
gonna meet any of my East Coast
followers and I was just so
stoked I'm being
to be there and be outside of my mats I
was like yeah following myself on this
exam that's my little dance we're in
wings so we planned from talk to one I
end up getting pretty gnarly like the
line was getting longer and longer and
longer when we were up there and so we
end up being outside from 12:00 to 12:00
to 2:00 when it was so fun it was
emotional there was a couple flowers
that may mean pouch a cry I cried like
three times that day it was just a very
emotionally and mentally and physically
draining day but it was absolutely
amazing me and Patrick are planning on
working at Julia's place from 2:00 to
3:00 so what you know okay we have to go
so sorry yeah sorry give me everyone you
guys watch this and you guys were in
line to meet me magic and we didn't get
to meet you I'm so sorry we have
to go inside wait no choice so I end up
going inside and then we had a bodyguard
escort us in like one in front of us and
then those who crawl behind us so it was
like a bodyguard dude in front of us
bodyguard do behind us check - and we
noticed that the booth was happen it was
on apartment like there was 75 people
around that booth like just around a
like hoarding the booth and we were like
holy I told you guys like people
New York I'm gonna be at this booth from
2:00 to 3:00 come by and say hi I would
love to meet you guys so say yes mm-hmm
can I meet you guys and so the fact that
the booth was swarming I was like hmm my
little booth babe
so we were stoked we got to the booth
and it was just crazy in his madness and
was so fun getting to take photos with
everyone me and Patrick are plotting I'm
trying to do like a little like a line
situation where people would line up and
they would be able to come meet me
Patrick and kiddo we were also with our
friends Viva Glam MK whose patches best
friend her name is Kalani
and we're like okay so let's go just
line everyone up and like we're gonna
take photos with them like with our
booth so you know okay we're you need a
heli get this organized right now
or we're gonna get trouble weird like
try to make that happen and all of a
sudden listen and a big-ass security
guard just like comes drone he's like
everyone move it can't move out of the
way this is a fire hazard and he was
like basically just screaming literally
screaming on top his lungs and he was
like are you guys doing the mean green
I mean Patrick like what um we're
selling brushes look at we're talking
all of our followers like okay you guys
we're gonna sell you these brushes we're
gonna take photos but you need to like
lean over our booth so we can take
photos with you guys and meet you guys
and hug you guys but like we need to be
acting like we're selling things because
the security is gonna get us kicked out
because it was really it was crazy and
we were blocking other booths
we're blocking other booths I'm not
going to lie we were like infringing on
other lines of other booths and so like
that so that's what we were trying to
organize everything but soon as that
security came in he just caused mayhem
like he just had to like come in barge
in the booth was popping and we're
infringing on the people's lines I get
it I totally totally totally get it but
we were also hired by this booth to be
here and we didn't know what kind of
response are you're gonna be getting
from our followers and we didn't know
that the booth was gonna be so crazy so
you can't really blame us for that so
we're trying to basically an organize it
and mean factor we're still trying to
mean people so we're taking something to
people the guard comes back like with
two other people and he's like if you
guys take one more selfie we're showing
the entire booth down because this is
 crazy
it's like crazy but I'm saying
 crazy if you guys take another
selfie with someone else not only are we
like getting you guys out of here but
the entire booth is getting shut down
so being Patrick like freaked out were
like like no we can't like we can't get
this booth shut down like she's here
like she paid so much money to be here
I'm at like just because the booth is
getting crowded with people doesn't mean
that she should be getting kicked out
when she paid thousands and thousands of
dollars to be there so much you look
over at the the leader of the booth
named Chi Chi and we're like Chi Chi
like we're so sorry but like we should
go because this is pretty crazy we do
not want you to get down because
we're here working with you we're sorry
but she was totally understanding this
is only after half an hour mind you like
this is from 2:00 to 3:30 like this is
all happening so like okay cause like
what do we do then what you can do is
you can go to a wall at the end of IMATS
and you can go meet people there you can
hug people and you can take photos of
people it'll be great you guys can go
over there and just be there at that
wall of I'm out so I'm like okay you
know what
we're sorry Chi Chi like we're gonna
just go meet our followers and we're go
meet our subscribers and just meet
people that were there to see us and
we're like okay you want okay twin
security escort us to this wall I mean
all of the people that were there at the
booth ended up coming with us and those
like like literally like seventy five
hundred people just trailing I says so
freaking hilarious so finally we get to
the back the back wall was actually like
25 feet away from like where they were
doing demos and we're like okay well
like they're doing demos here though and
we're meeting people here like this is
like really weird because we're gonna
distract these people that are doing
demos so we get there people are
screaming or like yes me and Patrick are
so excited because we're still here like
we get to so many people and we're at a
wall even though we weren't able to be
at the booth we're so out of water we're
still able to take photos and I was like
so I was excited I was so excited so
people are starting line up against the
wall
so all of a sudden like literally like
maybe three minutes like three minutes
and we took photos with two people we
met two people we hugged them to have it
took photos with just two people and all
of a sudden probably like five security
came up and they're like you know what
it's really great that you guys have a
lot of followers and like that people
want to meet you and that's an awesome
and we love it but you're gonna have to
take this outside now and we in patch a
little bit each other more like what and
I'm like um we just came from a booth
like because your security told us to
come over here because we're causing a
scene at the booth so we're at a wall
now like why can't we just stay here so
I think it's play he tells us he's like
you know what this establishment is more
like a professional atmosphere it wasn't
built for people to have followers and
fans here I got so mad I don't I just
felt like it just like lowered our
credibility and like lowered what we do
as youtubers and I just felt pissed off
it's actually like I felt even more
pissed at Patrick because he is a
professional makeup artist he does
clients need us freelance work and he's
been doing it for five years me I
understand I've only been doing beauty
in general for two years and I've only
had YouTube for like not even a year and
I was like you know okay well like maybe
I'm a basic it's fun but Patrick I was
pissed or Patrick he is a professional
and he is a pro makeup artist and I was
pissed friends is like don't
look lower his credibility just because
we're here and we're meeting our
followers and subscribers like I was
pissed and so they're like you know yeah
you're gonna take this outside so I'll
just like pouty and basically abouting I
was like are you serious like we just
came over just because you guys asked us
to so the security ended up escorting me
and Patrick out and luckily like all of
our followers and subscribers went with
us and so we went outside and we mean
that you were crying
because we were just really like we felt
really emotional because like we got
kicked out a lot of you guys came with
us and that's what we were so emotional
cuz it's like you guys came with us they
will know we gotta get though like we
were just really emotional and we were
crying or like oh my god like just we
just felt really happy we were pissed
off and happy at the same time so just
like an emotional bundle and I'll we're
both crying we just felt like super just
overwhelmed with the amount of love that
we were getting because like the fact
that we even had to get kicked out
because our followers and our
subscribers were there and it was like
such an overwhelming scene made us feel
so good cuz I'm like yeah bitch they're
here to say hi to us so that's
cool like that cool you know like I was
so stoked my laugh was coming off like
it was a mess
it wasn't met and we end up doing a mean
Creek outside for another two and a half
hour
end up getting really sick that night
real like real sick like throw up and
fainting sick because I think I was like
extreme exhaustion extreme dehydration
and just so much emotion going through
me that I end up just getting
sick going like non-stop for five and
half hours
like Mean Green status so I had a great
time I was exhausted but it was so fun
meeting everyone and it was just so
amazing the thing to with I met like I
unders I really truly understand why
they escorted us out thousand I was just
a random person walking by and I saw
this hoarding crowd of people they were
trying to meet other people I wouldn't
give a like I'll just okay cool
meet them
that's all good like do your thing you
know like that'd be fine but the fact
that the amount of people was starting
to differ people from lines going
towards a boot and spending money like I
would understand being the Buddha being
pissed off it's like bitch like really
like you're blocking our line you're
making us lose money so I understand
that aspect of me I totally totally
totally totally wholeheartedly
understand and I get it but the reason
why I'm saying the reason I'm even
making this video is because I just
think that they couldn't handle it so
differently like diamonds could have
really just handled it so differently
they could have been like kind they
could've been nice about it the fact
that they are like calling us out or not
being professionals and just like this
place was a built for people like you
and I was just so heated in that moment
they were yelling at our subscribers and
followers like and telling them to move
and I was just I was getting frustrated
because I felt frustrated for everyone
this is the thing like that was really
pissing me off I feel like I'm at they
want Beauty people to talk about IMATS
and they want people liked it like
inform people of IMATS and be like
spread that around spread that I
Mets wildfire but when it comes down to
it they don't want to deal with beauty
influencers and they don't want to deal
with people like meeting them and they
don't wanna deal with crowds they just
don't they probably don't wanna spend
money on security to like just help out
they want their cake and they want to
eat it too so they literally like they
want us to talk about it but they don't
want us to go heard that like Carly she
got kicked out on Nicole Guerrero they
both go he's out I'm Jacqueline was
there for a split second they were gonna
ask her to leave as well but she had
already like left before they even asked
her to go I was just so frustrated with
the whole thing on one side I understand
being IMATS and I understand the crowd
control and I understand getting us out
of there because it was it was pretty
crazy the lines were like getting
ridiculous it was just a madhouse for a
little bit but on the other side it
could have been so organized it's like
they just allowed us to be organized
with a
to understand the whole concept of my
maths I get its really professional like
entry people but I know for a fact the
people that buy tickets IMATS
they buy it in hopes of meeting other
Beauty people that will be there if I
thought that Chocolate Hills gonna be
IMATS I won't buy tickets I go to I
meant I mean not now because I'm a
friend like Dexter and stuff that's what
frustrates me is cause like I feel like
the beauty influences really helps
spread I imagine it really helps just
bring awareness diamonds and really just
bring so much revenue to them and the
fact that they're so against social
media and so against the social platform
of things it just really boggles my mind
cuz like bitch beauty gurus and stuff
like they hope you guys get recognition
and they help you guys grow as a company
like I know for a fact before five years
ago IMATS was barren it was a barren
wasteland like you we hear a pin drop I
know for a fact who I know people that
wit time at say years ago and it was
chill and it was not nearly the level at
what it is now and it's because of
social media because like for example
like with I met in New York you can get
a press pass if you have 250,000
subscribers so like they woulda given
you a free pass to go in but what's
gonna happen when I go in and I get like
swarmed by people like they're gonna
kick me out again
you're gonna give me a pass at 23,000
subscribers so that I can talk about I
Mattson going to high mass but as soon
as I get there you're gonna kick me out
because it's too crowded it makes no
sense to me
do not use Beauty influencers to gain
you revenue and you with your business
and then when we get there kick us out
that pisses me off so much I don't
harbor like bad feelings towards I'm at
but it I don't plan on going again and I
don't sound like supporting them in that
way because I was so whole hardly
believing it I met for so long until
what just happened with me and Patrick
getting escorted out and I was so mad at
that time it could have been so
organized it could have been so
organized but it was just like nope but
it's up to it because it's a
professional atmosphere I'm gonna
support all the other conventions the
next two that I'm going to be going to
our fame Expo and beauty con la so those
ones I'm gonna be going to for sure yeah
that's kind of what happened a lot of
people are asking me like what was going
on with I'm at why we got kicked out how
we got kicked out what we were feeling
towards IMATS you know um I don't really
know how I feel towards IMATS right now
like I understand why they got us out of
there because they don't want to deal
with her like followers or subscribers
or they want to deal with crowd control
or anything like
they don't want to deal with that so
they'd rather just kick us out instead
but they love the promotion that they
got from it huh and I know I'm gonna get
all the pro makeup artists like the pro
makeup artist so I say Pro very air
quotes because I got some oh I got so
many hate comments about IMATS like like
yeah like good thing you got kicked out
like you want kind of thing and I
would look at their pages hmm
the makeup that they were doing on
themselves and the other people
good lord please tell me you charge $3
if that it was a robbery like what you
were probably charging those people like
the makeup was the worst makeup I've
ever seen in my whole life I'm like half
the people I saw so I don't care about
the like the pro artists opinion so
because I don't do freelance work
doesn't mean that what I do is invalid
so I don't need to cater to your opinion
I don't really give a what you
think about it other than that I will
talk to you guys later
that is it for this video how carry some
actor if you guys are and I'll catch you
in my late mother video I just
wanna make this book quick please video
wasn't too long I hope something wrong
oh I've done it tonight yeah okay bye
guys who's that don't ever take me I
hate you my dad he was making fun I mean
cuz I said mom rude ass bitch
I'm gonna need you to ignore can you
guys speak I always do this I love you
guys notice I'm always like
mean you're welcome to him to Rocio I
mean just wanted to do it myself don't
ask me because I will not have an answer
for you this probably will happen like
no bloopers watch does not have any
 bloopers well she's not gonna
have any bloopers good I just
talked so so means afterward
Adam who's I mean don't wrong that's
right err what are you doing
and we're like how could they do this
duh no no that's not what he said in
that moment I was just so heated and I
just wanted to slap a hoe so
hard</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
