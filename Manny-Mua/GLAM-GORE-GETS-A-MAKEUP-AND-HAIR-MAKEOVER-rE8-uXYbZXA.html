something special guests we have miss
Mikey a K glam and gore on this channel
hi thank you so finger you guys Mikey's
one of the first friends I had in the
beauty space so I won if you guys know
this like back maybe like what four
years ago maybe five like Fame expose
man this for four years yeah for four
and then we met at BMX bo yeah but we
had been communicating before yes it was
so cool and we met and cheese just like
cool right away time like and you taught
me how to edit a lot of people don't
realize that this is technically not our
first collab no no there's you guys
gonna pop up the book today you guys are
you really fighting it too at glam you
up and do a fool like girly pretty
glamour on you which you already do
normally you already know how to do it's
so much fun having someone else do your
face yeah cuz like you kind of get stuck
in your ways yes and I want to do the
same product with honestly I don't know
so I'm really excited to see it so I'm
really excited and on her channel we're
gonna do some I'm so excited like I
don't think you guys understand
everybody have never leaping gorge
before I want my I want my ear to be
like down but other things so that's
we're going to be do to you guys that's
what as videos going to be as always if
you guys like this video if you guys
don't like us please don't watch
it Joe it I'm like still try all okay
guys it's going to get into it this glam
my good old faithful Bobby Brown I get
stuck doing the same thing like that's
what my face needs to do I'm always
getting nervous that when people
actually do their makeup I'm always like
oh dude you do makeup like yeah
yeah I think I'm a big cloud with
someone doesn't do makeup they're just
like oh my god you're amazing and I'm
like I know right we're taking tatcha
it's a so freakin good have you tried
this yet no this is a creamy foam the
silk canvas is a primer we're gonna use
a shade porcelain we're gonna really
pray that's porcelain hahaha we're gonna
really play this work
it never is porcelain one it says Von D
Kat Von D's is actually it's still dark
but it's gonna match yeah exactly by
feel it's actually going to end up
working up pretty good
yeah I really what's the like I think so
not maybe that is because like you know
when you get the care package of all the
foundations like I don't use everything
so why would you keep like the vampires
need it so oh if I kept this one because
I doubt such a pretty high light shade
your Heinie's that's exactly right
that's right pearl it's funny cuz these
are the lightest shade this is all I
used to highlight my under eye - that's
a real why here there we go
that's good yeah yeah okay good I say
that's a really really light but I think
it'll work
this could've been my whole face
foundation I have never used before you
kindly anything okay anything
okay honest I think you'd really like
like this actually yeah because it's
like a nice coverage but it gives you
like a really pretty more like a
luminous finish that's a pretty girl
right there some new you're moving yeah
moving I'm not gonna be here for very
much longer
yeah cuz I've been meeting you for
almost two years now it just like it's
gotten too busy here you can't even
finding parking here and it's just like
such a mess
you look great I mean you look friggin
snatched like better you by the way guys
I'm using a little Kim
okay number one big powder so when I
said we were gonna Gore you what I meant
was in real life I realize I'm gonna
murder you okay that okay I see okay
there's no way we're taking hula so
we're gonna take a little bit of a face
foundation powder we're gonna lightly do
temple I mean I do have a tan on my
stomach that's true we can imagine Fe
fucka this is already like like dark and
I even I use this to bronze sometimes so
I'm like really risking you know I'm
really really risking an image yeah you
look good you start working out like all
over again
I've noticed you like good even people
with me like they've been like dude
you've like lost weight and I don't
notice it because it's like for me it's
like a I just see I was like myself so
I'm like oh I haven't lost weight just
something I've just kind of done like
the thing but whatever people are like
dude you've been doing better and I'm
like actually I have been eating like so
much healthier than I usually do and I
think that's what makes the biggest
difference I had my first like really
big Saturday where I was like allowing
myself to have all the things I wanted
mm-hmm by the end of the day I was like
do you ever brush your teeth and floss
no never earlier in the night so that
you like you're not tended to eat more
because you don't want to do it over
again so I did that last night and I got
so hungry that I literally went crazy I
couldn't use I wit I got downstairs
hey like half a bag of hot cheetos and
then I had like top covered strawberries
and a sandwich and I was like didn't
work at all but it was so it was so good
Mikey yeah it was so worth it was
like the hardest thing to do on other
people to meet
yeah that's cheap phones dang
now we're gonna brush up really quickly
to get my little blush bizarre
on a cheekbone oh you look so pretty in
people eyes I never look really yeah
oh you look so cute in it dang like
she's coming from blood
from blood haha well you're just kinda
blood okay guys we're gonna go in with
uh Nastasia kitty cat uh a dream yes you
look good no cuz I always feel like my
forehead is kind of a big and I'm not
just to begin with so I tend not to draw
attention to it because you want like
avoid like that yeah but I just you know
soak on in why is that applying fix+
like the most fun thing and it just
feels so good you smell that it smells
good as if you can smell it alright
my just takes it takes a village no no
no I met like for the camera the
lighting I only have half a brow okay
cool so you don't make it grow there
they naturally come so low like the tail
end and I like to draw them higher so I
just shave off the tail because it's not
like it matters when you've got this
little brow to begin with why cuz I'm so
excited to see where you put them
yesterday someone in a store told me
that my brows are really defined and I
thought that that was nice of her
because she didn't realize that it's
just because I draw them on from nothing
no way she says you really thought you
like there's like no way for them to not
be defined when you've drum I'm just
gonna take that same consider we use the
kylie one and cleaner on that boom took
me a good second but i got it and i like
hey guys i'm gonna go do the other brow
off of camera cuz we go long
whoa that took some work honey
that takes some finessing I'm sweating a
little bit thing you look amazing I'm
gonna go ahead and do your eyes now what
are we gonna do I don't know this is the
prime always they're like mmm
this is the new makeup forever starlet
powder they're like oh I think we need
to use one of these
on the lid like oh okay 3502 because as
really good neutrals up here we're gonna
do neutrals and then we're gonna do a
pop of like glitter on the eyelid and
then do it the purple smokey eye
underneath she's transitioning oranjee
shade into the crease it's always funny
when I'm doing a clown something has
like really hooded intense lids like
mine so what I'm taking a photo I like
doing anything with makeup that's like
angle this way to get any come on you
always show your bottom teeth like you
guys I just angle okay what was one of
your favorite like fan experiences are
you a fever follower experiences that
you ever had my first big meeting great
that I did I got a lot of letters from
fans and then a few hundred people and
everyone was like super obviously like
nice and happy and energetic when they
meet and then I'm back in my hotel room
and I'm reading all their letters and
they're so heartfelt and they're like
deep and emotional and play I just say
my room and cried yeah how how does how
do I come into the equation yeah that's
like that's like the biggest blessing of
YouTube is like letting us reach so many
people I mean I can't even I can't even
fathom it really well that's why it was
crazy to me just like the the fact that
a few hours earlier I was hugging those
people and I had no idea how much going
through it men I guess to have that
interact interaction and I wish I knew
it sucks like I think I've done meeting
greets and they've gone by so fast in
times where I'm like I hope that they're
happy like I hope that they have a
communal experience of me like yeah you
know it means when you're trying to be
hundreds of people and it's like the
people that you're there with like at a
convention and they're like okay hurry
yeah but they're just like rushing me
they're rushing them and I'm like oh my
god I know all too well the figure is
much the better route that's so pretty
oh goodness yeah yeah okay so this is we
have so far very warm
fiery crotch
I'm a ginger oh you are years I made a
group once an ego so that's what leg
tried in true we were buddies in my tiny
bedroom that I shared it was shared with
a married couple in chase oh yes yeah I
had no space I never met this married
couple I think that's why I thought was
you for a second but I know it was you
too and you would like to literally have
like an organizer and then you like put
everything in for you're like filming
stuff because of do you remember what
else was in that organizer my dishes I
used to wash in my bathroom sink there
yeah people come on my way things happen
yeah things happen and you just have to
make it work hey you know that's and
that's why I like it like I like the
fact that I had to deal with like all
these other things in my life because I
feel like it makes me so much more
appreciative yeah wow that's pretty I
think I feel like it's almost like a
contrasting like the top and the bottom
part like contrasting a little bit this
is like more fun like I should get a
like experimental bit more hey I
wouldn't even be ballsy enough to try to
do blame on anyone I'm so rusty with
glam other people that it's like I'm not
even gonna know pressure this is the
heart yeah and I can breathe it's like
things idea tenseness uh I had some
Bakken increase I needed it and
I think that it definitely did snatch
