the gabbie show hello and I just smashed
the SH out of her face come on let's be
honest it looks so good I are smashed
now to the gods
Johanna Elliot when do we meet let's be
real if I let's tell them we meant it
would have been that uh movie with me
Gogu ghostbusters so we met ghostbusters
yeah I think so yeah we had Dan before I
feel like we talked before on me
whatever meeting cuz your sister she
like knew who I was she did that blue
inner corner yes yeah and my parents
bought her she looks stupid but
apparently she got it from me
she did and I was like you don't look
stupid you look Bob forgets a
little finger bending but rock about it
hmm
I love it look bottom as hell I want
this on my face all day every day
I'm not gonna be able to recruit yes you
were there's video our existence no so
what we're gonna do a might on her
channel she's gonna recreate this exact
glam on me how we're gonna see how this
turns out because I'm like a makeup
person like you're gonna look exactly
like this well I'm gonna look exactly
like her so she's matched every part of
my face nose lives everything so check
out the video on her channel to see how
she did
as always guys if you guys don't like
this video if you guys don't like me
please don't watch it don't mind
watching you know the joke with me
there's no me there's no need don't need
but you guys do like it please subscribe
to my channel and start Abi's okay we'll
even link it down below
okay go look kitchen
don't have a hair there yeah okay so
first things first guys we're gonna be
using the benefit professional she has
more porous skin she told me so I wanted
to use primer that's going to kind of
even out the surface of her skin she's
really nice skin I just wanted to make
sure it was really even and flat and no
oil would come out now we're gonna go in
with you make a fevour foundation in the
shade don't know because it's her color
and then we're grabbing some Urban Decay
concealer everybody concealing
underneath her eyes on her smile lines
and just blotting it out with a real
techniques Beauty Blender and now I'm
setting the under eyes with the RC Mane
no color powder just really insure those
no creasing and on the smile lines as
well and everywhere basically that we
have creases in the face I love the our
Sigma powder for this it's a fantastic
and then for the rest of the face we're
going to be using the laura mercier
translucent powder to really just set in
and lock in her face because I just
think that looks a much better movement
to just let the foundation just roam
it's gonna last a lot longer if you set
the face those in Bruxelles away let's
get the bushes away I let you out like
you shave my vagina so I'm going with
the Physicians Formula butter bronzer
and we're gonna go and bronze up the
entire skin with this when you have just
a blank face and foundation you want to
really just bronze up the skin to make
it look lifelike damn my face looks good
it's not bronzer and then taking
the cabinet kuan medium sculpt powder to
really contour and carve out her cheeks
I really want to emphasize those cheeks
because she has amazing amazing
cheekbones
and then we're gonna go in just contour
a little bit of the nose and snatch it
just a little bit and then snatching it
of course with some more translucent
powder to make it cook and let's look
really really nice and clean and doing
underneath the contour as well just give
her a nice contoured clean look and
appearance cooking what the product
really really works and now I'm going
with the jus a citrine highlighter and
highlight her face with it it's
absolutely beautiful she was living for
the highlight she loved it and brushing
away the excess powder now and taking a
little bit of Becca wild honey blush and
putting it on the blushy areas of her
cheeks and she really really liked this
blush color - it was so cute and
a little bit of her fix+ mother-of-pearl
what you can see Shannon up and then I
go on work in her brows we're gonna take
the benefit number five goof proof
pencil and really just start to carve
out and shape out her brows I could
really just work on the shape first and
fill in from there and then using that
spoolie to really brush out the hair
taking a little bit of concealer and
outlining the bottom part of the brow to
really make a sharp and clean you guys
see me do this all time I love it and
taking the smashbox 24-hour primer
primer eyes to make sure we have the
shadows thing on all day long and then
taking the Anasazi and mario palette and
mixing a bunch of these colors we're
gonna put that into the crease with the
morphe 27 and really blend out that
crease and work at it so there's no
harsh lines and no house edges taking
that dark chocolate brown in the palette
at them on a morphe and four three three
we're going to blend that into the
crease as well and then taking this
beautiful beautiful maroon shimmer shade
or put that all over the lid and buff
that out with another brush it's such a
beautiful color I'm really just making
sure we continue to define the outer
corner taking a little bit of citrine
again putting on the brow bone to
highlight the brow bone and really lift
up the brows and then doing basically
the same exact thing that we did on the
top we're gonna do on the bottom and
blend that out really want to make sure
that we have a really nice blended out
look it's really really blended in
person hopefully it shows on camera
that's really blended cuz it really was
and then taking a little bit of the
Tarte nude pencil we're gonna align her
in her waterline to really open it up
but have her curl her own lashes because
I don't like curling peoples lashes oh
wow this feels a lot different than my
target eyelash curler is it so now we're
going up I some TARDIS Tarte mascara on
top and bottom lashes of course her
lashes are so amazing don't even you put
lashes on but we decided to do it
because we're so extra and now I'm gonna
take a little bit of the monster
eyeliner and the little brush and I'm
going to really define her lash line I
really didn't want to do a full intent
of winged it just I was really feeling
that I just want to do a really nice
pretty definition on the lash line and
then adding some lashes of course I
didn't these were Serengeti my new
bounce um I'm not really sure I'll try
to find them a link them down below and
she loved loved loved loved the lashes
now taking the Charlotte Tilbury pencil
just to outline her lips just to see a
guideline for me for the liquid lipstick
that we went in with
from smashbox called true gray it's a
brown one i were to go in with this
brown which is so pigmented it's so
beautiful and really going to work on
making sure that the lines are clean and
really pretty of course taking a little
bit of concealer and that is the entire
look guys i hope you guys enjoyed this
tutorial it's so beautiful she's so
beautiful and I'm so happy how low
turned out it's so complimentary on her
skin and her eyes okay guys so that's it
