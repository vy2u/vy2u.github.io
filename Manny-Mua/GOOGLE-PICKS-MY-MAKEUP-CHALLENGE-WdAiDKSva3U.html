so today's video I am so excited to be
doing because it's going to be a little
bit of a challenge video and I saw miss
nikkietutorials do this this is the
Google picks my makeup challenge or
video or I don't know if it's
technically a challenge but it was kind
of a challenge so shout out to
nikkietutorials for hosting this video
I'm going to link her video down below
so you guys can see what I'm talking
about and I actually want to take her
video idea and I could turn it into a
little bit of a twist kick my own little
spin on it personally and so I'm going
to be doing like my own little spin on
this Google challenging you guys will
see what I'm talking about a little bit
later when I'm going into the video
anyway I'm sorry that if I sound like
because I just got back from Coachella
and it is dusty and musty and fusty up
in that bitch but it was so much fun and
I had an amazing amazing amazing time so
thank you so much to provoker if we're
having me you guys are such a wonderful
team and you guys are all so sweet and
if I do guys didn't require us to do
anything you guys just wanted to bring
us along so thank you thank you thank
you and whenever I get back from some
type of trip or something from that
building for a long time I literally
forget what to do I'm like I'm not a
film and what I'm doing how do I do you
to be like I don't know what to do
excuse me if I'm a mess I'm
always mess as always if you guys don't
like this video if you guys do not like
me please don't go I take
another drill with that what do you guys
do like seveal please go and subscribe
to my channel if you're not already and
if you knew what is up on mani MUA
and welcome to my channel thank you so
much for being here it's so funny
whenever i'm like passing someone's like
many more and i let me say i'm an emu a
in every single video if you know me as
man you want the new same
anymore when you see me in the
streets anyway let's go and get in to
this you guys so as I said this is a
Google picture makeup challenge and
Nicki's video too typed in her person
last initial onto Google and like that
first photo was what she used as her
inspiration for a makeup look so I'm
gonna do for my video and said I wanted
to change up a little bit and I went
ahead I typed in the word primer the
word foundation the word concealer and
everything that would pop up the first
two of the options like glue would
suggest to me to buy was what I decided
to use in today's videos for example the
first one I typed in was primer and the
first thing that was popped up to me to
suggest to use for primer was the
hangover RX by Too Faced so that's why I
wanted to do today's video I want to
just type in primer foundation
translucent powder see what Google
suggested to me see what things I liked
I thought it'd be kind of fun because
I'm like what would Google suggest me
someone that uses makeup who is like I
make a person online but they like
listen to what I do and listen to what I
say and know my life you know like the
FBI is watching kind of so when I
did that and I actually took a
screenshot of every single
product I went in with you guys - no I
literally typed it in so we can see a
personal one right here face primer the
person that popped up is two-faced
hangover RX I wouldn't and I did the
first two like I wasn't just gonna do
like the first one is the first two if I
didn't have the first one I would
hopefully have the second one as that's
kind of what I did
we're gonna go right in with this one
just use our fingers we'll do one pump
actually really like this primer a lot I
think it's so hydrating and pretty and
nourishing and I just really enjoy it
mmm and I've used this many times before
I wonder if that's why Google gave it to
me because so now let's go ahead and go
in with our foundation for foundation it
suggested for me to use the fenty Beauty
foundation the pro filter soft matte
foundation and I have used it before and
I really really really like it so I was
really excited they suggested me to use
this one and I'm like okay cool I can
totally use that but you gotta morphe
sponge this is my contour sponge favors
which ever it's seven bucks you can use
my code man anyway this is so thick holy
 I'm using the shade 117 anyway guys
you can use the code man um you and the
morphe stores and save some coin this is
just my favorite Beauty sponge it just
works really really nicely a good color
match I would say anything I used to
love this when I first came out I would
mix it with a lot of things because I
thought it might be a little bit too mad
on me sometimes I'd be like oh bitch
that's a little too matte huh huh this
gives you like a really nice medium to
full coverage build it's a very matte
foundation though so I would say if
you're dry or have dry patches I
wouldn't really suggest this cuz I think
that gives you a pretty matte finish
not gonna lie no more use it the more
you like how about it is I'm like down
your Vogon Matt full uh-huh that is so
thick it's thick like jizz bitch
I forgot how fast this bitch sets what
do think Matt the shade I mean the shade
is goodness a good match this is a good
match you guys know if it's not a man
you a video if I'm if I'm matching my
face I need to go shades darker you know
that you know that I remember I would
use foundations that would cheer this
out a little bit oh my god the other day
you guys okay just because I'm in my
neck right now sir I'm writing mean the
other day I've had like a baby little
skin tag like right here for like a
while now it's like a tiny little one
and I'm like this is so annoying like
just I would see it and Laura pointed
out one day and she was like oh my god
what's on your neck and I was like I
don't know what is it she's like oh we
have a skin tag and I'm like oh that's
gross and so basically I got nail
cutters and they cut it off myself and I
thought I was like I was like oh my god
I'm fine something a little you like me
I'm like I'm gonna be good I'm gonna be
fine I'm gonna cut it off we're gonna be
good you really hurt so next what did
Google suggest for concealer it told me
to use the Tarte shape tape it was the
first concealer
I was like damn tart shave tape like it
really does will this world turn
t-taking sorry it really does and we're
gonna go ahead and conceal with this
Thank You Google ok Google no
heart-shaped tape is a staple item at
this point I don't think there's anyone
in this world if they use makeup that
doesn't know what heart-shaped tape is
you see all this coverage do you see
this face that I'm beating into the
ground into the dirt see this
mug I'm even the shade light by the way
obviously the 50 foundation oxidized of
it as you can see but you see how you
shade light and it works just fine and
now it looks like it's a really bright
white shade I love a good drag under eye
honey I love a good white 10k drag queen
then I white cream under I don't why I'm
being a little dramatic right now I
apologize I just had two sandwiches
you know I'll weed that and I'm just
feeling my oats you know who here is
excited for the lunar beauty I think
you're excited I'm so excited for my
bright launch now we have to set the
face and what Google suggested for us to
use for setting powder who has the laura
mercier translucent powder and I'm like
damn dude nice just know me well it's
almost like creepy I was like how do you
guys know what I'm using or how do you
guys know like maybe they don't know and
this is this is these are just like the
most popular items and sure yeah I would
say tart shape David is probably one of
the most popular can see there's of all
time true is Laura Mercier chances are
one of most popular tens of powders of
all time absolutely so maybe just give
me the most popular items with things
that they suggest that are like really
good or that people search for do you
think this is a case for Shane Dawson
beauty conspiracies with Shane Dawson
who thinks I should feel my Shane Dawson
I think I should I feel like i meanshe
need to do a video together I just feel
like we're cut from the same cloth you
know we're both weird I just
think that we need to do it those
trained if you're watching this what
you're not obviously but it's okay
if it gets back to you I think we should
 film I'm so sorry now into the
ground that I'm just gonna take a very
lightweight
amount of powder on this wet sponge to
set the rest of my face because there's
no way this one you should already set
so mad we hard Boyd how are we looking
I hate this area over there bitch what
am I supposed to do about that I have a
big nose and increases on the side
now we're going with some bronzer and
the first ponds we're gonna be using
only bronze we're gonna be using is okay
google must know me this is really
freaky because I did bronzer and it gave
me benefit hoola bronzer which I love
and it gave me Physicians Formula butter
bronzer both which I love
are we scared or just me what's going
just broadens up the face maybe it chose
hula because I was the face of hula mmm
okay well so should I just dust a little
bit of the physicians on top because it
was suggesting oh my word oh that's
really dark oh I apologize to
everyone watching it's just this smell
so good it's hard not to use it you know
you guys we're looking soulless
okay Google what's next next we have
blush suggested and Google suggests us
to use the Milani baked blush in the
shade
luminoso it's the first thing that
popped up so of course that is something
I do own go ahead and put some of this
on I love this blush so much how is it
the first one that's so crazy that a
drugstore Milani blush I suggested as
first in the blush category for shopping
that was nikkietutorials bitch that was
Nikki I feel like that's how I started
using Milani Luminoso because of
nikkietutorials I was like her for
a long time maybe that's why this is her
challenge I'm a glowing goddess I get a
lot cuz it sounds like a really soft
Sheen so next we have a highlighter so
what is the suggested highlighter from
Google I'm raising X on a staff
everything counts
how the is this gingers next to me
for you such a beautiful honey why would
you do it to me buddy is it a no are you
kidding
are you kidding you're kidding
with this highlighter you guys I would
use a more compact brush where I
wouldn't use like really have a fan
brush for this because it is a baked
formula cuz they're usually pressed a
little bit harder what are you doing but
I my daughter is going crazy right now
and in case you guys didn't know I have
a daughter I'm actually straight just
kidding nothing dick bitch I'm gonna go
into custom I know son
there's no needs to be snatched down him
it needs to be chiseled it was no nose I
was given and I was born with but did I
want it no there we go I don't know I'm
sorry I'm on one I'm kind of hyper right
now I don't know what the fuck's going
on with me this face Waco so we have to
be brows completely on this what they
look like we have just dip brow threw
him in the shade of taupe I really
really really like the shade taupe
because it's like a really cool toned
brown and I am doing it I what are you
news on the eyes what is next I typed in
eyeshadow palette and Google told me
what exactly so first Google told me to
use the BH 88 matte shadow palette and I
was like no absolutely no so then the
second one I suggest me was the huda
beauty obsessions palettes and I have
one of them right we have the warm brown
obsessions a Hutu beauty I've not
actually used easia at all i swatched a
couple of shades by
never actually use them personally so
I'm very intriguing I'm very excited to
try them out first when I first saw
these launched I was kind of like this
is not a lot like it just seemed like
such a small amount it's cute it's good
for on-the-go
but I remember thinking like people
gonna even buy these like there's
literally nine shades and they're so
tiny and it's like they're not practical
they're so little
but then I was like wait wait wait wait
wait to toss in a purse a quick on the
go like something it's easy especially
this one this warm Brown obsessions it's
actually really really pretty we're
gonna go right and we're just gonna do
an entire eye look with this pellet
we're gonna take the warm brown and that
nice vanilla you shade to blend it in
the transition spot right there
okay Google I don't understand why I
keep wanting to say that I just don't
well do something orange II as a
transition of course cuz you know I
lived my orange shadows are blending
really nicely which I'm very happy about
we're taking that high up whoa let's
take a little bit of that peachy shade
to just mix that in there
it's really pretty why am I kind of
living for this palette line actually is
blown wow I'm gonna dish is so blown out
like gay bros Amara's whole at
going beautiful stunning now let's go in
with a knife hey they've got a deep in
it on a more feet bar 39 oh let's take a
little bit of that center gold chain one
right here and that is so pretty
oh my word look at that oh my god damn
copper i new lip strikes again for
google of course so I feel like I'm in a
desert I like I'm getting lost in a
field of sand so now that we're blown
out when go in take the deepest deepest
lemme purpley clear over the on the most
outer corner over here just a deepen it
a little bit on the outer corner okay so
that's the top of the eye right now so
we have so far thing it looks so pretty
so far Google is slaying my me
that I'm gonna go and do a little bit of
eyeliner now so what I asked Google was
like yo let's do an eyeliner what would
beat you for eyeliner and Google then we
should use these Smashbox always on gel
eyeliner so Justin go and run this down
the lash line and blend it and blur it
out a little bit I'm just going to make
him more of a smoky lash line basically
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna blend out that
black on the lash line on the lash line
right here
I never do this I never use pencils I
look like lashline makes my eyes water
 the eyeshadow is so foiled
and it won't let me put down black so
now that we have that black down we're
gonna go and take a little pencil brush
and take that darkest Brown Mabi purple
sheet actually wanna blend like so we're
just blending and blurring so we should
have something like this so far and for
mascara Google said we need to be using
the Too Faced better than
sex after that was the second one
suggested on the list without a second
one so we can use it cuz we're gonna use
one or two I almost forgot mascara
because I literally always wear lashes
bitch okay cool I'm gonna go finish the
other eye off of camera and I will be
okay I am back now so I went in I did
basically I do on the top on the bottom
lashes so I really I just really smoked
it out on the lower lash line same exact
colors and I highlighted with the Omri
Zee highlighter in at the inner corner
and the brow bone as we can see right
there and for lashes I asked Google I'm
like yup what we want to do what kind of
falsies do we want and it told us to use
I lore so glasha so I'm like you know
what all right then we pulled up miss
Isle or ex Vegas and nay lashes and
these are in the style platinum princess
I'm not like I mean they're okay I'm not
like obsessed with them I feel like when
it comes to these kind of lashes that
the band is almost not thick enough you
can like to see my real lashes
underneath it doesn't blend well with
the falsies it doesn't blend well with
your real lashes I don't know I'm not
the biggest biggest fan I think that the
effect is really pretty and I think they
look pretty on the eye I don't know they
don't also don't want to stay up which
pisses me off so now we're gonna go in
with V lips and we're going to be
completely done so I went in I put lip
liner on Google and it said the
Charlotte Tilbury lip cheat which I do
have a thinking board in the shade
iconic nude bitch you guys know I would
own a lip liner called iconic nude I'm
joking
literally nudes is all I ever wear and
this is like a straight-up like a nude
nude like a darker deep nude it's not
like my normal nude go to just click
that's a little dark for me but all good
I go ahead and to stop talking come on
you know we're gonna fill in about half
the lip with the lip liner
okay we are lip line and we are lip
cheated we are cheating this lip I have
overdrawn to the gods so last but not
least I went ahead and put in lipstick
and the first one that popped up was to
MAC lipsticks are we surprised I'm
really not Mac has cornered lipsticks
for so long now like I just feel like
Google wouldn't suggest me anything
other than Mac so I'm gonna go and take
the shade creme de nude I don't like
that take a little bit of miss better
better I was a little scared at first
I'm not a myth from Mac used to be my
go-to nude lipstick I would wear it all
the time I still wear it so often into
my travel bag with me and you guys that
is it this is entire face chosen by
Google Google said bitch this will be
your face and I said bitch okay I am
living a thousand lines bitch as it came
back from the dead she's reincarnated as
a sickening beauty look how funny this

lashed down here oh that's and
