get into this chit chat get ready with
me full face full face so you guys know
that's just good okay why you guys no
makeup on nothing my face is completely
clean
moisturize and that's wedding so it's
gonna start with some primer first I'm
gonna go with the Too Faced prime tan
poreless it's this one uh-huh and it's
great for oily skin gives you a nice
smoothing poreless effect mostly in the
t-zone where I have most pores clap a
lot of pores the t's the T's and the
pores and the pores and the t's you feel
me
and then do a little spritz of Smashbox
primer water just to get ready so I go
in and start with the face first time
pony show I'm gonna take the morphe e6
flat top kabuki seems like my favorite
of all the flat tops that morphe has
this with my favorite and then we take
the door air crash foundation let's
spray the brush directly gives you a
nice and medium to full coverage give
you a beautiful finish it's absolutely
insane like I'm obsessed and just start
packing that onto the skin I'm using
this with a kabuki brush because it
really gives me the coverage that I want
as well as the finish
pretty airbrushed finish as like
pearlized pigments in it gives you a
nice like dewy finish makes you look
like I am like dewy and like pretty and
natural looking like I'm naturally this
tan when I know my ass is not the same
okay I'm going with the Urban Decay
Naked skin and weightless concealer in
the shade light neutral and you guys
know me I like to highlight like a crazy
badass bitch and then I'm gonna go ahead
and mix it with the Mac prep and prime
in light boost another thing I use all
time it just it's just so good it's
really brightening and makes me feel
like I'm so awake and bright and happy
and then we take a more VG to just press
it into the skin what I love about the
g2 is that keeps the coverage there but
it blends out like a dream and to set
that I'm gonna take my favorite under
eye setting powder the laura mercier
secret brightening I love it so much on
a morphine port 3/8 stepped on dry this
isn't the brush I use all the time for
setting my under eyes I think it's the
best brush ever because it just pointed
it's easy it's so convenient also you
guys don't forget I have a code with
morphe it's many MUA in all caps
you guys take 10% off on anything from
morphe I think it's a cool coat more
peas on my favorite affiliates of all
time you guys know I use them in like
every single video and I have make my
morphe favorites of course like the ones
I use all the time actually I beginning
tons of requests to do another favorites
of morphe brushes video if you guys are
interested in something like that let me
know because I can totally film another
one like there's definitely enough
brushes where I could totally film
another favorite brushes cuz I know the
first one went over really really well
and you guys were like really happy
about it so I could totally do another
one if you guys are interested so I'm
yeah oh cool so we are highlighted and
we are come Co Olga I'm going to set my
face because now everything all the
liquid and cream is on and it's cooled
I'm going to take the Laura Mercier
translucent setting powder it's my
favorite setting powder of life it is so
good music that morphe G 0 and just set
the entire face with it just press it in
which is this what to eat the most oily
I like to pack on the powder a lot more
in the places I get like hello oily
which is I mean everywhere and then for
my neck I'm gonna gonna take the makeup
forever 1:18 Pro finished powder I
always just use this for my neck because
I don't like to take a liquid Zowie neck
very often but I don't want my face to
be a different color than my neck
so I usually just go down my neck with
some powders you know just lot easier
for me this biggest powder brush is so a
life change
name several wraps up the skin a little
bronze up in that the hinge I'm gonna
take a morphe - and I'm gonna take today
I'm gonna take two faced chocolate
soleil admin use chocolate Soleil in
like forever and a half so I'm just
gonna kind of brought up the skin with
this one I always use hoola because
that's my favorite bronzer of all time
but it's going on with some little bit
of tea face sunshine for the sake of
being different this one's actually
really great because it's matte and it's
great for people that want to do more of
a natural makeup look
literally and though adam talking i'm
getting the bronze in my mouth and I'm
tasting the chocolate Stace I'm good I'm
just dusting the bronzer along the
perimeters of my face underneath my jaw
about cheekbones on the temples
Oh Dior flash why you got me up
in the best way why I'm not going to
take some like highlighting powders now
I'm gonna go in with teint and for 3/8
and I'm gonna take the Kat Von D shade
and light palette the middle one it's
the only one I hit pan on because you
know I love that color so much
hey you know about right now I'm trying
to kind of highlight and brighten up the
face a little bit more
obviously I'm highlighted from the
concealer but I need to be a little more
brighten that girl because that's just
not gonna work for me he that's not
gonna work only I'm like trying to film
with like a little bit more distance to
me you guys can see more of my
background you see more my chi chi's it
just a little bit clothes we're just
closer today we're a little closer
that's fine now I'm gonna contour a lil
bit more I'm gonna take V mega geek
chisel cheap brush and I'm gonna take V
shade over here from Kat Von D I'm suing
the contour with it you know already
talked about it's my favorite Contin
brush right now and by right now I mean
ever here I'm just gonna call it
or with it as well just get ready with
me it's like a like let's just
go to an event this is like my event
makeup other than like the door air
flash oh that's like my top layer
foundation
whenever I'm going to an event I wear
three layers of foundation and I don't
even give a
I wear Loreal Pro matte available than I
do NARS all day luminous and then the
top layer is Dior air flash it's a
little excessive but it lasts all day
and that's what I need I need a bitch to
last a whole day I mean I need a man to
last all day too but that's not
happening is it not anytime soon so
now for the blush I'm gonna going with
some blue cheese mousse I'm gonna take
the morphe 4 brush this one is just a
cute little like me brushing up and then
we'll take wild honey by Becca I talked
about this a billion times before it's
my favorite like fall time blush as you
guys in
from the previous video I'm just go
ahead and apply your blush as usual I
love this blush because it is like
beautiful like apricot it's like an
apricot or ng shade but it's like a nice
burnt orange and it just looks so pretty
on everyone even if your lettering
complexion if your darker complexion it
looks beautiful on you because of that
just carrot cotta color it has so next
for highlighter I'm gonna go in with uh
necessity heels starlight highlighter
and what am I saying Anasazi over the
hills I wanna say it like so fast like
as I don't use just like you know she's
like the baddest the baddest bitch in
town you know summer takes starlight
which is a very iridescent pale shade
great for like latter complexions and it
almost gives me like a silver pinkish
period essence to it can you see that
and I'm taking on the Anasazi a23 brush
which is the brush that came with this
highlighter is like intense as I've
been actually wearing starlight a lot
recently but I've been using it as a top
a topper for my other highlighter so
I'll go in with like gilded honey from
Laura Geller and then I'll go in with
that starlight it's like at the tapas
tapas point and it just gives me like a
really intense like boom blur she's
gonna be really intense blower you know
yeah the face is done I'm going to start
with the highs and now let's get into
this eye look because that's like the
point that's the point of this book I
wanted to go really hologram I'm cool
really great
okay goes I just don't you guys in
because I think it's gonna be a lot
easier to see what I'm doing when I'm
zoom Dean Lee great so I went ahead and
already filled in my brows that I
already pride in my eyes I feel like
that just an easy step that you guys
already know and you guys see it and
you're like the look I don't need to see
that again so I'm like okay okay so
eyebrows are filled in and I already
have primer on so I'm gonna go and take
a morphe 27 and I'm I go in with beaches
and cream and that's going to go into my
crease I just a nice beige color it's a
very just neutral which is why I like it
so much I can use this color with
literally anything which you will see
right now it's not too warm and it's not
too cool so it's just really great now
I'm going with a morphe m-43 3 which is
of course my favorite blending brush
just like a Mac 217 dupe it is literally
the exact same thing as a Mac 217 if
you're interested in that brush like
seriously get the morphia 4-3-3 first
just to try it now it's literally like
four bucks it's absolutely amazing and
of course i have the code morphe already
talked about it but it's so good i think
you guys should definitely try it i'm
gonna take that with sugar pills
poison plum which is a gorgeous deep
rich purple that's one go on the outer
corner into my crease I'm actually gonna
keep it mostly
the outer corner not so much in the
crease and I'm also placing that lower
than I have beaches and cream just give
me some nice like gradient effect and
then I'm lightly going forward with it
I'm doing my eyes open for this because
I feel like it's a lot easier to be able
to see where you're placing the color
rather than like doing this solo
especially for me cuz I kind of have
hooded lids I'll have you guys have
noticed but I have like a little bit of
a hooded lid going on and I try to kind
of overcompensate for that as much as I
possibly can by to my eyes open when I'm
doing makeup so it just really helps
what I'm doing that another person that
has hooded lids that does makeup
absolutely amazingly is nikkietutorials
if you guys are ever interested in
watching someone who does amazing makeup
whose great to watch and has hooded lids
watch nikkietutorials because she kills
it every single time and then I'm going
to take a little bit of makeup geek
corrupt and then that's going to go on a
little on a little tiny e36 pencil brush
it just any kind of pencil brush will
work great but I just like this one for
this and what I'm doing is I'm just
adding a little bit of black on the
outer corner just for a little bit more
dimension I'm going to be doing a wing I
think with this look so I want to just
do a little bit more of depth
I like how black looks against purple I
think it makes it look so cool and like
just intense and like really crazy so
I'm applying a little bit of corrupt on
the outer corner way lower than I put
poison plum like so oh I feel so witchy
in purple I don't know I feel so
witching purple and I'm just going to go
ahead and go over with that important
III just with no additional product and
just kind of blend over the corrupt and
then I'm so excited to be using this
this is like what I'm so stoked for this
is what I wanted to use for this video
I'm going to be taking black white by
makeup geek which is one of the newest
shadows from the new duochrome line dual
chrome is a duo color so it's like you
see one color in the pan and when you
turn it on your eye you see two so it's
just kind of like a really cool
different duochrome effect it look gives
you two color dozen just one and I'm
taking black light on my finger and I'm
gonna apply that on the lid black light
reflex teal and purple so I literally
had to use this almost all the way into
the lid I'm leaving a little bit of the
front lid open so I want to go in with
another pigment I know I'm so excessive
but whatever oh it looks so oh I hope it
looks as badass to you guys in camera as
it does in person because it looks
friggin sickening it's like teal and
purple literally and I'm just going in
with a temp or 3 3 in just blending out
the edges and they
for another star of the show I'm going
to be going in with the pigment sugar
rush I'm just going to go and dip my
morphe m32 six in to the pigment this
pigment is a white that reflex teal and
purple so I thought it would go so
perfect with this look I just put on the
glow brush and I'll put that on the
inner front of my eye as well as I'm
gonna use it to highlight my inner
corner as well and then taking that
three to six and blending out that sugar
rush duochrome this basically this
pigment reminds me of the lumi by
sugarpill on steroids basically it's
like on crack I think I look super super
super super cool I'll be zooming you
guys into obviously after I'm done with
the eyes but I'm just gonna finish the
other eye off-camera quick and I'll be
right back so I'm not even gonna lie I
think this look is turning out really
really really pretty
I'm really happy about it something for
this look I really want to do eyeliner
I've been actually doing a lot of like
no eyeliner looks but I think for this
one I'm gonna use eyeliner I'm gonna
take my Sigma e oh sick which is my
favorite liner brush if any other brand
creates a brush like the eo6 by Sigma I
swear if more feet creates a oh six by
Sigma like they will slay everything
this is the best eyeliner brush I've
ever used
I'm not kidding it's the best I'm using
slate gel liner by Mark II which is like
me but it's a super good black liner and
it's like super inexpensive if you guys
wanna do it intentionally do an
intensity if you want to do a normal
wing doing a normal wing
boom and then just fill that bad boy hey
boy great so the wings are on they are
on fleek and they're feeling good so
let's go and finish the bottom of the
eye the tops of the eyes are done I put
a little bit mascara on already just to
like save some time I'm gonna take
poison plum again I'm gonna take that on
a morphe m500 8 just a small tiny
smudging brush and i put that underneath
my lash line just for some mol pebbled
mention is that the watch out for sugar
pill shadows are like extremely
pigmented like obscene amounts of
pigment am i gonna do the back end of my
eye and feathering it for just a slight
smidgen not a lot because I want to be
just more like an outer corner thing you
know you know you know you 36 blend that
out let's go and mascara the bottom
lashes I'm gonna be taking the extended
play Google ash by Mac which is again
favorite mascara for the bottom lashes
ever it's just so good keep on and
washes are coated I'm trying to do a
little bit of new liner in the waterline
the Mac it's like an nw20 pencil things
are provider I'm not quite sure I'm just
gonna line the inner waterline of my eye
just for some a little bit more
awakeness this is such a good nude
pencil because the last on the waterline
all day oh my goodness I think Jaclyn
was the first person I ever watched use
this and I was like obsessed and so i
winning grabbed it and it's like so good
thing it's like a concealer pencil but
full UI so now we have the eyes
basically done I have all my eye makeup
on I'm gonna put on some lashes I'm
gonna take a very subtle lash I've never
tried it before if they're called new
bouncing Bella means there's no drove
with these lashes I can't stop
using them I think they're perfect and
they are a dramatic a slash but you know
what they make every look better than
than what it was before put the lashes
on plop the bitches on like a America
hey perfect eyes are done I'm gonna
going to be gettin to see what the final
eye looks like up close and personal
hope you guys like it
and yeah that's it that's it for the
eyes I'm gonna go ahead and finish the
face off with my lives I decided today
that I'm gonna go in with a neutral lip
I want the eyes to be like the dramatic
part of the whole entire looks sir am i
go in with some lip stuff I'm gonna take
NYX people neutral lip liner which is my
favorite lip liner up Lila and line your
lips with it over Thomas really shitty
today mm-hm
focus on us a little better perfect we
are overdrawn and we are aligned and we
are good - what is this so now for the
lip I'm gonna go in with a lipstick a
very nice neutral beautiful lipstick I'm
gonna go on with the Maybelline lipstick
it's like the one in the purple I think
they're called color sensational matte
lipsticks I'm not really sure what
they're called but they're in the purple
tube so I'm gonna take these shade six
five five daringly nude during lenient
with a pug daringly nude so I'm taking a
shade I'm gonna put that on my lips love
