and with my friends and we noticed how
there was a person next was being so
rude to their waiter and I was like why
the do people do that I was a
leader I was a waiter for two years I
think that if someone's rude to a waiter
you just run the opposite direction
honestly it's so up and just vile
my guys they're literally there to wait
on you like there's literally serving
you it's not an easy job okay I remember
as a waiter you don't how hard it is to
like handle so many different tables
I don't know this that I saw the
girl she was like being such a
asshole to the waiter and whatever I see
someone being mean to a waiter I'm like
that's your true colors showing
and I'm out
I'm out guys so okay I'm gonna
tell you a story of when I was a waiter
and this is like my most like
embarrassing I can't believe this
happened to me but not like not
embarrassing at all it was just kind of
like I can't believe 70 it's like
literally was like a porno so crazy and
I worked in a place in Hillcrest in San
Diego and that's like the gay area of
San Diego so I was like 21 22 thinking
I'm hot being a waiter and I'm like
meeting all these cute boys and I'm just
like thinking I'm so cute like a
little tween so I had his table and it
was a guy in the girl and it was a gay
guy and a girl and I knew he was
checking me out like the whole time the
whole time I was waiting he was checking
and I thought he was so fine so
I'm like cool every time I would pass by
his table oh look at him and he'll look
at me and you know that kind of smile
and I was kind of smile back just kind
of being quirky and cute and like
whatever the
so the none of the guy gets to their
table I serve him a drink to my table
would you like and I gave him a little
drink a little alcohol wherever the
you want it so I'm like okay I have to
pee so I go to the bathroom so the
restaurant I worked at they did not have
a bathroom before the employees and the
bathroom for the public right they had
all they just had one bathroom and right
when I was going into the bathroom I
looked back at the table of the hot guy
and made him caught eyes and then I was
like okay whatever and I walked into the
bathroom he walked into the bathroom and
so literally only me and him in the
bathroom and I'm like going pee I'm
peeing in the stall any pees in the
urinal and I'm just like okay this is
super weird but I was kind of into it
because I thought you super hot salt
like I'm gonna you just kind of followed
means about I was like kind of like hey
how are you hopefully you're enjoying
the service like hopefully everything is
going well for you like kind of thing
because he's in the bathroom like I'm
gonna make small talk it's so awkward
he's my table and I just fine I'm
gonna talk to him and I got the
threshold of Assad he's washing his hand
he's like I think the shoulders is going
great I think the service can go a
little bit better and I was like what do
you mean what do you mean the service
single it was like the so I'm like
Ahuh explain some more buddy and he's
like he walks over to me and he starts
to try to kiss me and I'm like oh my god
oh my god he's like I keep trying
kissing her now and then I kind of go
with this why I start kissing him too
but in the bathroom but my work
I'm like Waze this really happening are
we kissing in the bathroom on my
work right now I'm a waiter and
this dude is literally kissing up on me
we stopped making out and I go back to
work I'm flustered I'm red my whole like
beards red like my face is red his
because he was like it was like a really
passionate intense making up session so
I'm like trying to breathe at the same
time I'm washing my hands and he comes
up behind me starts to put his hands
down my pants down the front and
the back trying to like full-on finger
me while I'm in the bathroom I'm like
dude this is going way too far I'm
literally working and then you're gonna
get you're gonna guy and I'm
like no no I have to go back to work and
this is what I was like dude stop like
this is literally too much for me right
now Joey tells me he was like well me
and my husband the guy that just joined
him was his husband he's like me my
husband or interesting you want to come
back with us after your shift it I was
like no I don't I'm okay that happened I
said no I was good thank you so much for
the offer
I was very sweet of you I thought you're
hot as we made out it was a
porn for him to be like the service
could be a little bit better and I was
like what do you mean full starts making
out with me bitch I was gagged not gonna
lie I was fully fully erect and gagged
at the same time and not in the guide in
the way I'm like used to you know just
kidding I don't have a gag reflex you
guys have new weird crazy experiences
like that let me know dude
I live for that weird like I love
it you know when I was I would
definitely but it was a world man
coming out for me was such a whirlwind
because I grew up Mormon so it was just
such like a weird like I was thrusting
into the gay world and I really know
what to do and I know how to make
friends so it was just a very very weird
confusing time okay guys we're gonna try
the kidney W at Beauty highlight and a
contour kit we're going to be testing
these bad bitches now I'm gonna take the
light kit this is not a review video and
then this is just me using I just want
to try them out they look really really
nice two components a beautiful it's a
very very heavy I think it looks very
classy very chic so we're gonna go ahead
and bronze up look at me since I've
gotten a little bit dinner my fat here
is going down a little which is cool let
me see the brush feels very soft very
nice quality actually feels very very
nice I like this brush a lot more than
the last one with the creams I'm gonna
take the bronze you shaded a lot of
powder comes off which is nice this is
the light kit looks very very very
orange why you nervous but we'll see how
it looks okay everything's blending and
very smooth it's not overly pigment oom
I'm actually shocked I thought I was
gonna be a lot more pigmented cuz I'll
block came off on the brush I think it
definitely is a little orange not gonna
lie it's definitely a little
orange but um the brush feels really
nice I'm really happy about this Wow so
far so good guys I'm really really
living okay it feels really good it's
not too rough on the face it feels
pretty soft and the color pion is great
the blend ability is great you can
definitely tell a difference you can
definitely tell that more bronzy in
certain areas which is cool as so
when I just grab the door real quick
answered the door I'm and where I'm so
sorry - the postman Kim K bronzer is
really pretty and I'm really
living for it so far so hell yes smells
go in contour a little bit we have the
cool tone contour shade right there
taking this out of morphia y9 great
contour brush my should make it under
pressure again and blends very very
nicely I like that it's more cool tone
kind of dials down at the oranjee
warmness of the bronzer what do you
think now it's go and highlight with one
of the shades does one take the lightest
shade right here on the same brush I'm
not really used to brush this big for a
highlight definitely the highlights
definitely definitely there it's a very
very intense very blinding nice picks up
a lot of texture though so this is one
of those highlights that will pick up on
your texture so just be cautious and be
aware of that but the color itself is
really pretty
not as blinding as I'm used to but it
definitely builds very very nicely why
should it actually looks really nice
down the side of the nose though
oh I'll not really do like the Kim
contour kids teens are really pretty I
think that looks really nice on my skin
tones I don't think that the more bronzy
shade is a little bit too warm it's a
little bit too orange for me I don't
think you can make it work for sure so
it's not the end of the world but I
means also $52.00 of things so you guys
have the money for it great awesome
yeah if not just pass man there's not
something it's all good taking a little
bit of some blush this is one wild
pearlescent pink oh good I'm still gag
at the fact I told you guys about that
story about me about my sluttier days I
don't know why would I know so I'm
adding the shade Uranus on top of my
highlight god damn this is the
collaboration with me and Geoffrey this
is the second round but I'm using this
on the top of the cheekbones giving it a
little bit of a gold twist this shade
guys it's like a beautiful nail gold so
it looks like it took a really really
pretty
paly gold whoo blinding Brit no
honestly this is sickening I love it so
much I'm so happy we did a second
highlighter basically this is the golden
sister of Eclipse I wanted to have a
pink and a bold I think that B
complement skin tones so nicely and I
love it the way Uranus looks on the skin
it's so blinding and so intense and
those are coming at September at 9th in
the bundle box so I'm not really sure
exactly when this video is going up but
we have Uranus in Mianus this King and
that's the reason the packaging is a
little bit different so we both thought
would be really fun to include more of a
planetary logo when it comes to the
shade Uranus I'm like you know what it
applies so nicely let's make it happen
and we totally didn't they
killed it I love it whole thing I
 love it I want to mean I wanna
die alone so basically this is the face
I want to keep it like this I'm gonna do
my brows off of camera real quick and
I'll be right back okay guys we are back
and you and I look I think I want to do
something more fun more bold today and a
run and this nice neutral transitioning
do the grease you guys it's been the
craziest month honestly first of
all when you talk about the fact that
I'm in Sephora representing hoola
bronzer that is literally so wild to me
on the Q guys understand well it was the
first bronzer I ever owned when I worked
at Sephora start working in Sephora a
couple years back and before that I
didn't really know what the I was
doing the makeup I had no idea so when I
start working in Sephora they gave us
hoola bronzer like it was like one of
the gratis items so now like looking
back and just kind of seeing how crazy
it's been like now I'm in the face of it
you know in Sephora it's like it's just
the craziest thing I cannot
benefit and for allowing me to be part
of this campaign I talked about it
already on snapchat and Twitter and on
Instagram everything that that this is
basically a campaign that benefits doing
with a couple other influencers it's me
Geoffrey Laura Nicole and Caryn and
Katie I love sunny and it's just a
really fun just different campaign you
know these are products that we all love
that we all use and benefit was like yo
the reason we were chosen is because
these products are staples for us I
don't like people are asking like why
other influencers weren't chosen for
this but it's like hey we love benefit
and we use benefit all the time it's so
 cool and it's just so rewarding
to be able to see that you know I I was
told to delete my Instagram for my
parents when they saw it really first
found me for the first time and it was
the most devastating thing that ever
happened to me because one of the first
times I ever had a real panic attack my
parents found out I had a different
Instagram when I had a manic MUA
Instagram I was devastated full-on like
had a panic attack
was breathing into a plastic bag I
almost went to the hospital because I
was so shook I had no idea like they
were gonna find it you know I blocked
them from it I blocked through
everyone's ears names I booked every
member of my family I blocked them so
going from that point in my life where I
was bawling and crying in my room
because my parents wanted me to delete
my Instagram that had a good amount of
followers on and not that many he had a
couple thousand it was something also
passionate about something I loved doing
- going from that point to here where
I'm the face of hoola and my
parents work for me now or work with me
full-time it's just like so beyond
bizarre to me guys it's the craziest
thing I don't know I feel like good
things happen to good people and I feel
like I'm a good person
so maybe my hate me that many people
that about me of course I think
this is one of those things words like I
know in my heart I'm a good person I
think good things have happened to me
because I think I'm a good person you
know to accomplish the things I wanted
to accomplish it I want I was any
plastic surgeon I was on a very
different path than the path I'm on now
so you don't need to listen to everyone
when it comes to your dreams you know we
just follow the dreams that you want to
follow like march to the beat of your
own drum things will fall into place
when you work hard and are passionate
about something the passion you have
will resonate within others and you will
become successful do whatever makes you
happy for your future and for your long
word and I promise you you'll be a
happier person for it if I were to have
listened to my parents those several
years ago and deleted my Instagram I
would not be Who I am today I would have
been a completely different person I
would have followed a completely
different path I just wanted to kind of
say that come on here and just talk to
you guys about that
you know I just feel like it's important
to follow your dreams do what you want
to do and not always listen to the
opinions of others so we are back my
camera died so I was kinda like myself
to go to out of anti South they
clam those that I look is turning out
just a fun different just pop of color
so lets going to our lashes put some
mascara on call it a day
you do some lower waterline action real
quick just set a little white moment
this one wants to make an appearance
Lucy hi yeah I miss you so much okay
we're almost done guys we're gonna power
through do you guys have pets because
honestly as soon as I got Zia my life
changed for the better I never knew I
could love something more than myself
for my family like I do with her and
it's different because I have selfie and
Emmy of course back home in San Diego
but honestly I think it's just a little
bit different having a family pet and
having your own pet like Zia is my
actual pet like know if you live with me
and Nick was my brother it's a different
attachment than I feel then I felt with
I mean in Sophie and I don't know why
that is I just feel like she's like my
personal child you I thought I'm kind of
not like do you guys understand one fan
and I worry about her every day
I can't even let her go outside by
herself because I'm scared a hawk is
gonna get her like I just can't like I'm
just a petrified little parent and I
can't imagine having children let's get
some lashes on this face on this look
good eat that and we'll be right back
okay guys so let's go ahead and finish
off with the lip and we will be
officially done we're gonna do a new lip

lined to perfection I can't talk about
that lip liner just yet Eddie is when a
Hemi is now we're gonna take these shade
