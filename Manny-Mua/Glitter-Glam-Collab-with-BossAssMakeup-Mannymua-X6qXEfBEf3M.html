watch it okay hi everyone
so first things weren't wearing in land
oh yeah we're gonna go in with the mac
prolongwear concealer on our entire
eyelid where she do a very light layer
of is what's great about using this
concealer as a basis that it has
technology in it to keep it from
creasing and it's going to kind of take
away any redness that our eyelids might
have put the beautiful base then we're
going to go in with a Mac 224 brush with
Peach Smoothie by makeup geek all of our
anti-crease you don't need to be neat
with this at all it's a great transition
shade you can see you can go on the lid
with this it doesn't matter you don't
need we need at all now going to go in
with the Mac shadow and tease with ease
and then makeup geek stiff dome brush
now we're going to put that right into
our crease right where our peach movie
is is just going to help give us a more
pinky hue and to kind of blend that bad
boy all our voice as well right into the
peach smoothie it's gonna help when we
go in with a darker pink color next then
we're going to grab a 224 and just kind
of blend the whole thing together again
now we're going to go in with dolly puff
from sugarpill with that same dome brush
we're going to pack that bad boy on the
outer corner you just need a little very
little mound of this product in a little
bit goes a long way we're just going to
blend that into our crease lower than we
have the Mac color
we want that kind of greedy and dowon's
we blended really nicely never been
going with that 224 and blend that
out you know so ray obviously I like it
I'm an idiot now we're gonna go in with
a flat brush with taco from sugarpill
that's going to go right on top of our
Lin we're just going to kind of blend
that bad boy with that step don't brush
with no additional product at all check
out the camera see if you're being
pretty now we're actually going to be
doing the tape we're grabbing a piece of
tape putting on the back of our head and
take away that initial stickiness and
we're going to cut that tape we're going
to put it on the side of our I right
where eyebrows is about a connect the
outer corner of our eye and I'm actually
gonna grab a little tiny baby piece and
put that on our lid what's gonna be
great about this is gonna keep the
glitter from transferring up
just make sure that you press that onto
your lid just so there's no empty cracks
or creases or anything like that
and now we're going to go and grab the
elf lock and seal and the bitch-slap
Cosmetics good or tower in this
turquoise color and we're just going to
run that elf lock and seal all over the
empty space just I really saturate the
lid now we're going to go in with that
teal glitter and just really pack that
bad boy very slowly you don't need to be
fast with this at all just very very
very lightly you just press that bad boy
in now remove the tape and voila boom
winged liner easy see I told you it was
gonna come out burning now I'm just
grabbing some tape and taking off the
excess glitter that fell off my face I
mean I shouldn't have done my foundation
verse but I did now I'm gonna go over
with a foundation brush just kind of
help those areas I took off with my
a-team now I'm going in with a
Maybelline black gel liner and smudging
it out with a tiny tiny Real Techniques
brush just to get some depth back in
there and now I went in with after party
