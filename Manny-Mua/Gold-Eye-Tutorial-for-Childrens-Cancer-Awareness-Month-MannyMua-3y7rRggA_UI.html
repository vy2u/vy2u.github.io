see this even title tags video tags
video is going to be a little more
sentimental a little bit more meaningful
towards me and I hope meaningful towards
you guys a little back story I had the
amazing opportunity to meet this little
girl named destiny I same Expo this year
hi destiny if you're watching she was
diagnosed with stage 4 cancer
she was lilius one of the most amazing
people I've ever met she's beautiful
she's so happy she's optimistic and
she's so full of life and I surely
wanted to dedicate a video to her to
give me this shirt fa Mexico it's so
cute it says our goal for destiny it's
September so that means it's Children's
Cancer Awareness Month and I really
wanted to make a video dedicated to her
as well as everyone that has suffered
with this illness and gold is actually
the color for children's cancer so I
wanted to really incorporate a gold look
and that's why I did a gold look I know
I'm not an oncologist and I know I'm not
a pediatric oncologist for that matter I
don't study cancer I don't really know
much about cancer but I wanted to use my
platform to be able to just bring more
awareness to the subject I know people
think that cancer is more of an adult
thing but it's not cancer can happen to
anyone and it's very important to just
be aware I've never had anyone in my
life that have had cancer so I really
can't really speak from experience but I
just wanted to make this video because I
wanted to just spread love and
positivity and I really want you guys to
cherish the life that you guys have and
just to always be loving and caring for
other people you just never know what
kind of struggles they're dealing with
this is what this video is dedicated to
I dedicated to destiny and those other
children suffering with cancer any kind
of cancer so this videos goes out to all
you guys you guys are so strong and so
brightness so beautiful and I commend
you guys so much for being brave
individuals you guys are you guys like
this kind of video guys don't like me
please don't watch it I'm not gonna say
the f-word because there could be
children watching this one cuz the
Children's Cancer Awareness if you guys
you like this video and you guys do like
me please like this video and subscribe
to our Channel and comment we guys
thought of that but without further ado
let's get into this video okay great so
we're gonna start with this look with my
face already done right I'm completely
like contoured bronze highlighted
everything except my lips to go up my
lipstick at the end but I told her to
really focus on the eyes and that's what
this whole looks about is about a gold
eye so today what I'm using a lot of
makeup geek I'm excited I'm gonna take
the morphe 27 which is like a nice
fluffy blending brush amazing for the
crease and
beaches and cream by makeup geek which
is my favorite transition shade of all
time
I call it beige in our home because it
just it's just so good it's like a
beautiful like peachy color that's a
great transition for anything
I'm already primed by the way my eyelids
are already primed so I'm just kind of
going in and putting that into the
crease this shade is about two shades
darker than my skin tone but it's such a
nice color to transition anything into
like so this look is gonna be so easy
you guys like don't even trip like is
this look is gonna be easy and very just
like user friendly so I'm gonna going to
take bit tin and Coco bear mixed on a
morphe and four three three come in a
little bit more great so I'm gonna put
that on my crease and that's not going
the outer corner right into that beaches
and cream color this is why I had
beaches in creep down first happier
transition shade is really great for
blending because it makes the blending
process a lot easier because you have a
color to transition into rather than
just going into skin and it's gonna make
it look less patchy so I'm gonna go
ahead and take that bit in a Coco bear
all the way into the beginning of the
eye now I'm kind of taking it out
slightly so you can see this what it
looks like
there's nothing too crazy I love the
makeup geek shadows are the best shadows
ever seriously and I'm going back in
with that you 27 my morphe again and I'm
just gonna run that over the colors so I
just wanna kind of focus the e27 on the
crease I kind of take that out a little
bit more mmm
so now I'm gonna go in with this new
shade that I've never used before it's
called deep cocoa and it's my morphe
actually it's a nice little more cliched
and I'm gonna take that um morphe you 36
pencil brush and I'm just gonna kind of
put that in the outer corner of my eye
just with that added definition nothing
too heavy this color is so beautiful
it's like in the same exact like color
family so I wanted to keep it really
nice and warm I'm praying I'm just kind
of tossing that into the crease I like
that you 36 pencil brush I mean it's
just a universal brush but this is
really great at getting into the crease
and you're doing like really nice
intense detail work I'm tansy torque I
mean just detail work in general and
then I'll go back in with that 4-3-3
kind of blend out that de coco into the
other bitten and cocoa bear color just
to kind of make sure that there's no
hard lines I'm very big on blending and
keeping everything very seamless and
looking almost like as if you are born
with it you know nice to fuse crease
darker on the outer corner very easy
very easy hole easy dashing applause it
was very easy and now for the starlit
show i wouldnt be going in with magic
act by makeup geek which is a foiled
shadow it's a beautiful golden yellow
gold champagne color it's so stinkin
pretty look at that shirt I remember
that on the lid with my finger I think
just applying the foil shadows with my
finger it makes it so much better try to
keep that on the mobile lid you don't
want to take it too too far out because
then it's gonna get really shimmery in
the crease so what we're gonna do is go
back on the in four three three Gators
kind of blend out the edges of that
magic act into the bitten and the Coco
bear mix just so that looks very
seamless and very just like I said it's
supposed to be there and you should have
something like this for the top of the
eye nice golden gorgeous golden lid with
the nice really you just warm crease
super easy look there's not many steps
to it just a couple shades so I'm gonna
go finish the top of this hand real
quick and I'll be right back we're great
so the eyes are done the tops of them
are at least so I'm gonna go ahead and
finish the bottom of the height now I
already curled my lashes off-camera just
cuz you know it's easier that's way so
let's do the bottom of the eye now
because it's just easier so I'm gonna go
ahead and mix beaches and cream waves
cook obey I'm gonna toss that on the
lower lash line of my eye just for our
some outer corner dementia I'm gonna
start on the outer corner the reason I
mix cocoa bear with beaches and cream is
because it kind of lightens the color
slightly so I'm just gonna kind of
feather that forward very lightly
nothing too heavy
I'm gonna grab a morphe m5o weight which
is a very flat like kind of some muddy
brush and I'm gonna grab that deep cocoa
color if I'm working on it with that
closest to the lash line on the outer
corner for that added dimension okay you
don't need to be too new with it
we're trying to stay as close to the
lashes as possible and I decided I want
to go nude on the waterline so I'm gonna
grab the Tarte inner rim liner and I'm
gonna line my inner rim oh man I just a
really kind of help open up my I don't
want to go white I don't really like
going white on the waterline very much
but I like to go very like nude on the
waterline so I wanted to do that and
vain for just another this is an extra
kick you could be done with I now just a
mascara you'll be good to go but I
really wanted to take it the extra step
and I wanted to do a little bit of
glitter on the inner corner so I'm
taking a glitter glue any kind of
glitter glue works I'm just testing this
one out for a friend I'm just gonna take
a little bit of glitter glue on my
finger I'm gonna take it on the inner
corner of my eye not too much just a
little bit and then I'm gonna take Mac
reflect gold which is one of my favorite
glitters of all time I have it in a
little container like this and a morphe
m32 six super small little smudgy brush
and then I'm gonna go ahead and pack
that glitter in my inner corner
and this should look something like this
nice just really glittery inner corner
what'd you guys think fantastic so we
have both the eyes done now almost
completely done like widget on mascara
and lashes to go we'll be good to go I'm
gonna take my roller lash by benefit and
put that on the glass if I can just open
this damn mirror to go and find a little
coat of mascara on of your favorite
mascara mascara on
I actually went ahead and put the extend
to play giggle ash buy a Mac on the
bottom lashes I think my bottom lashes
are kind of like basic as hell and so
what I have to do is I use the Mac
extend if I get galosh because I feel
like this one is the only mascara that
really helps separate and they give me
extension and volume in my bottom lashes
I don't even make sense but it's
definitely my favorite mascara of all
time for the bottom lashes Patrick and
Jacqueline and when they use this one
like religiously so they got me hooked
on it and the hook Shin is real the hook
is real you know this is not a man emu a
look without some lashes so I'm going to
take my favorite lashes of the moment
New Balance I'm Bella minks and my
moment having throw ever try not to
sweat while you're doing it cuz I am so
wetting up a little piglet storm we're
just having last trouble today okay
great great here we go
I don't really feel like doing how they
know with this look because I didn't
want it to cover up any of the gold once
keep him on the natural side so I went
ahead and just did some lashes rather
than and no liner still the lashes give
me a lot of definition so I feel like I
really need eyeliner so I like how it
looks guys are done yeah this is what
they look like I'm going to be you guys
Ian
okay great so now the eyes are done I've
already done with the face I'm just
gonna go and do the lip now I'm the
serenity which is my collab color I'll
leave links and codes down below if you
guys are just in buying it and I think
the lip goes perfectly with this look so
first were to go and line our lips we
can take NYX peekaboo neutral lip by now
we're just want my favorite lip liners
from NYX I just said that I'm gonna
overdrawn my lips so if you want to over
job be my guest
I'm gonna wear all Queen on my leg oh no
more drama you feel me I left over draw
with colors like this because I feel
like it makes my lips look so much more
full and so much bigger than they really
are
and then my takes Trinity of course and
I'm gonna put that on my lip
such a beautiful colors to beautiful
formula it's literally everything huh
I'm gonna let that dry on the lip and
that's it for the whole entire face
what'd you guys think and that's it
that's it for the whole entire look I
know it's such an easy short video I
mean hopefully it's short I'm not really
sure how it's gonna be
I just really hope you guys take
optimism and love from this video that's
all I really want you guys to take I try
to emote positivity and optimism in my
channel all the time and that's kind of
what I want from you guys is what I
really want you guys to just be more
positive and loving and caring for
others you never know the struggles they
may be facing and I know I'm guilty of
this I know I've judged people before
and I know I talked to crap about people
before that I didn't like or whatever
everyone's guilty of it and that's
totally okay no one's perfect obviously
but just kind of be more conscious of
things I know if you catch yourself
talking maybe just see like why am
i talking about this person and
just kind of reevaluate yourself and
this video goes out to those children
