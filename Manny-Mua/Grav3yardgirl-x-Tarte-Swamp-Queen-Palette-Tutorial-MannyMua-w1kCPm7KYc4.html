as you can see from the title today's
video today's video is going to be a
tutorial on this look I have going on
right now very bold very intense I kind
of cool tome lip very very cool very
different and it's a special video
because it is using the swamp Queen
palette by graveyard girl she
collaborated with tar cosmetics bigger
girl is a youtuber here on YouTube and
she's so popular she has like seven
million subs and she collaborated with
Tarte and it just so cool to see such an
amazing person luckily I have met bunny
in the past I met her at I believe it
was Texas beauty con like a year and a
half ago and she was doing the mean to
be at tarts booth and she was such a
sweet person just so kind and
down-to-earth and just so cool you know
what I mean like she's so
unapologetically herself I'm so proud of
her for doing this collaboration with
tart it's so cool like she's gonna be
inside so for us you know to me like
that is absolutely amazing and the PR
package that it came with what they came
with a little alligator and little
alligator wrapping paper it was just the
cutest thing ever it's so so so cool
this is the look I came up with with it
how I have it on my eyes right now I
asked you guys on snapchat and on
Twitter which you guys should be
following me on if you guys aren't
already many MUA on snapchat many MUA 73
on twitter
check out those i'll leave them
somewhere on this video ask you guys
what you guys wanted to see a more
natural look with this palette or more
bold and dramatic look with this palette
so end up winning was the bold look and
that's why I have such a bold look on my
eyes right now I've been doing tons of
bold looks recently but you guys seem to
like them and you guys have been voting
for bold so that's what I came up with
today wait I haven't stop rambling on
I'm gonna go into this video now as
always if you guys don't like this video
if you guys don't like me
please don't punky watch it you know the
drill with that but if you guys do like
this video and you guys do like me
please like this video and subscribe to
my channel if you weren't already and if
you're new what's up I'm annyeong your
way and welcome to my channel yeah let's
go to get into this a full-face
graveyard girl bunny look
you
okay so to get started on today's video
bear face nothing on my face right now I
wanted to do a full face video today
because tons of you guys liking what I
do full face videos so you know what I'm
listening I'm listening to guys I love
you guys I'm listening okay so first
things we're gonna prime we're gonna use
the makeup forever step 1 equalizer in
the smoothing at the moment this is
literally like my favorite pore filling
smoothing primer out there I would say
that this one end benefit Porefessional
are like my favorites so for foundation
for today's choice we're going to be
going in with the co Gendo aqua
foundation I just love this foundation
it's so freaking it pretty I'm gonna
take two pumps maybe two and a half
maybe three let's be crazy I'm in the
shade one two three it gives you a very
nice lightweight coverage but it's very
buildable so I really do love this and
so I like to put this around the face
and then of course I'll conceal on the
area's a tiny little bit more help like
underneath my eyes and whatnot so we're
just gonna take this on a Beauty Blender
and just Pat this into the skin okay so
I need a little more help on the
forehead because I am breaking out a
little bit on the forehead right now I
just have been I'm gonna take the
L'Oreal infallible in the 103 and just
put a little bit of that on the forehead
and maybe a little bit on the nose as
well because this foundation is
definitely more on the luminous dewy
side and I just want to add a little bit
more coverage with delaurio and add a
little bit more mattifying effect in the
t-zone so let's go ahead and conceal I'm
gonna take the makeup forever Ultra HD
concealer and y23 I'm not using
concealer in a minute so I'm
excited I saw I forgot I don't know how
to use this again
squeeze okay yes squeeze honey squeeze
away actually squeezing is kind of
annoying hmm use my finger instead put a
little bit on the back of my hand and
use my finger
oh yeah I like using my finger way more
I feel like it more gets look at that
squeeze finger mm-hmm down the sides of
my nose a little of this concealer goes
such a long way I love it let's go ahead
and start blending it away how have you
guys been I feel like I have not filmed
in a little bit of a minute
no I'm just kidding I feel like
yesterday the day before that what the
 my things I like this concealer
because it is very hydrating it's not
like a drying concealer whatsoever and
so therefore increases less then a dry
and concealer would so I really do like
that effect of this concealer now go and
set your under eyes with the Laura
Mercier translucent setting powder or
whatever powder you guys like that works
for you I personally just like this
Laura Mercier translucent powder because
it works so nicely from my skin type
it really sets everything in place it's
lightweight but it's still heavy it
sounds weird but it really is like a
lightweight heavy powder it really works
like keeping like oils at bay keeping
you from creasing everything you could
possibly want from a powder this really
does ensure that and I'm using this on a
848 by morphe you guys I need to tell
you guys a secret not even a secret I
just I just work what's happening um so
morphe is discontinuing their elite
collection brushes I know I know I'm
devastated
tons of people were telling me on
Twitter they were like hey so the
brushes you've been using on your
YouTube like and you're linking them cuz
I got I do link on my brushes that use
on my description bar like I'm always
pretty good with linking everything
they're like hey the brushes that you're
using are not available I'm morphe
anymore and I'm like what do you mean so
I go on morphe site and they're not
there so I'm like hey so then I text the
owner morphe and I'm like yo so I'm just
curious like the lead brushes like
what's going on with him what's
happening so when they first came out
with the lead brushes they were supposed
to be limited-edition and because they
were so freakin popular they ended up
becoming kind of permanent or like
staying on a lot longer than they were
originally going to so that's kind of
like the backstory of the lead brushes
what's going on is that they're actually
coming out with a different set of
brushes very similar to the elites and
they're taking away the elites so if you
guys are wondering like why the brushes
I have been using I've not been on site
I have not been on the website is
because all the brushes that are there
right now are the last ones of the elite
brushes if you like any of the brushes
that are there get them while you can
because they are on sale and they'll be
gone soon so for now just bear with me
with the brushes I'm using because these
are the ones I have so until they send
me the next batch of the new brushes are
using I will be using those till I have
them just however and just how it is
conscious even the title of today's
video is using the swamp Queen palette
by graveyard girl and tart she's doing a
freaking club with tar she didn't have a
tart like that's so amazing so
congratulations bunny I'm so proud of
you and you should be so proud of
yourself you know what I mean this
palette is absolutely beautiful I'm so
so happy for you so I'm just gonna
bronze up the skin with sweet tea which
is the bronzer in this palette on a
morphe M 5 to 7 which is still permanent
on their site it's like the Mac dupe
brush for the bronzer which n dip into
that a little bit
oh it's pigmented as got it Oh dust
a little bit off and then start going
and bronzing how is this color so
this color is like a really warm
terracotta brown with some gold shimmer
to it it's very very very subtle it's
not too intense but it just gives you a
nice pretty bronzy color oh it is a
beautiful beautiful color it's a little
bit more on the like warm orange side of
a bronzer but we are in summer so that's
totally fine with me and I'm really into
like warm orange bronzers anyway it's
actually funny because I get clocked all
the time on social media my bronzer
being too warm for my skin but I'm like
if I like it I like it bro
you don't like it don't watch it
is this so cool like all these youtubers
coming out with collaborations like I'm
so excited for everyone it's just such a
cool thing like I'm just so proud of all
these youtubers clapping with different
brands and not only just small Instagram
brands but like huge brands like Tarte
and like nikkietutorials doing one with
Too Faced coming up and Jacqueline of
course with Becca it's just so amazing
to see these brands and trusting into
youtubers enough to want to collaborate
with them and yes Niki Jacqueline and
bunny are all huge youtubers and
they're all like killing either the
Queens of the game but still like the
brand interested them enough they're not
celebrities are not in movies you know
to mean to endorse a product it's just
so cool to see youtubers get this kind
of like reaction and get these kind of
opportunities even though they're just
on YouTube you know what I mean so it's
just so cool to see that and I'm just
very proud of everyone that's done clubs
so far and I just hope they keep coming
I hope they're just as amazing as the
ones that have been coming out I'm gonna
highlight the under eye really quickly
with my Marc Jacobs insta mark of course
a 48 same brush and I'm just gonna
highlight the under part of my eye and
then I'm also gonna take a little bit of
that powder and run it underneath my
bronzer to make it more of a clean
sharper appearance or doesn't look so
muddy and harsh you filming and I'm
gonna take a little bit of Mac shade
stir just to contour a little bit
underneath the bronzer on a new brush
from morphe this is the g---forty it
looks really like a awesome contouring
brush and I tried it once and I loved it
so I'm gonna keep trying it see what I
think about it and so we're gonna dip
into it barely not too much it's small
and defined but it like I feel like it
really like contour bitch out you know
so let's go and start contouring a
little bit yeah see I knew like I
 knew this was going to be a
bomb-ass contour brush like I just knew
in it I'm just gonna take a big fluffy
brush and run over it the whole thing
just to make sure there's no harsh lines
and edges I like everything
soft and dainty ER again of course I'm
taking the blood shots in this a palette
this is the blush called does this thing
really work and I think that's from her
series on YouTube like does this really
work so I'm gonna take that padding more
feet III brush or any kind of blush
brush that you want to use use that
brush and I'm just going to lightly dust
oh my god it's painted I'm just gonna
very lightly press and dust off it's
like a pinky blush with some gold
reflect in it so we're into a light
layer of this please tell me a little
light Oh a very pretty soft pink layer
okay cool so we have the blush on now
and let's go ahead and highlight because
there's a highlighter in this palette -
it's called Gator wings that is the most
perfect name for bunny I've ever heard
it's so adorable
Gator wings so we're going to highlight
with that color and I love the blush I
think it's very very very pretty and it
to be universally beautiful on so many
different skin tones so I think they did
an amazing job with that so it's one
highlight a little bit I'm gonna take a
more feet M 510 and I think honestly the
whole type out this is what I'm the most
excited for is the highlighter because
it is absolutely stunning so freakin
pigmented you need to be careful with
this whore because it is intense
but in the best way and I can just see
like it just come on come dude look at
this highlighter like what the Freak
basically take a champagne gold shade
it's a very very very light weight and
it almost looks like it can be white on
some tones but it's a very just
beautiful champagne gold it has gold
undertones in it so it's of universally
stunning on so many different skin tones
so I think again such a beautiful
highlighter it's very intense like I
love it - it's funny - like with
highlighter I get a lot of hate on the
amount of highlight I put on and like a
lot of like people a lot of people say
that like it doesn't look good on me and
it emphasizes my texture and whatnot and
it's like yo if I have texture which I
do I'm a dude I have big pores
like whatever I have 2x shirt why why
avoid something if you have texture like
who cares who cares like I used to be so
insecure about my texture on my skin and
I wouldn't want to avoid highlighter
because I was so scared of what people
would say because I do have like picture
on my skin but now I'm like I literally
do not give a single solitary titty
about what people say about my texture
because I have to
and living with it who gives a if
you want to wear a pound of
highlight on your face just do it it
doesn't matter what anyone's saying
about your face your texture your skin
do it it's what makes you happy if it
makes you happy do it I like to wear
like a highlighter and yes I have two
extra on my skin yes I have bumps on my
face but I'm gonna
so please do if you guys like it please
wear highlighter so yeah I'm done with
the face I'm gonna go and finish off
with the eyes now okay cool so we are
back now my brows are done and my eyes
are primed let's going it started with
the eyes now I'm so excited to be doing
this tutorial I actually asked you guys
on Twitter and on snapchat what you guys
wanted to see if you guys want to see
more of a bold eye dramatic look or a
natural eye lip with a more bold lip I
think it was literally like 52% was bold
eye look and the rest was natural eye
look I'm gonna just follow you guys are
asking of me and I'm gonna do a bold
dramatic eye look with this palette
today so first things first we're gonna
go in with natural peaches on a morphe
27 brush just any kind of fluffy
blending brush will work and I'm just
gonna take this shade into the crease
this is a very pretty natural transition
like peachy shade it's Larry called
natural peaches so that's what it is
it's a natural peach transition so then
we're taking morphe and 4-3-3 which is
very similar to the Mac 217 to do for it
absolutely love this brush I literally
have like seven of them they're so good
you can always use a code mani MUA in
all caps to save on morphe i'm morphing
an affiliate you guys probably know this
by now if you guys know me you guys know
that they're just my favorite I
absolutely love morphine so I'm gonna
take this brush and I my take man Kat on
it which is a purple deep plum shade and
that's going to go into my crease
extremely extremely pigmented holy and
that's just going to go into our crease
all the way to the inner corner because
this look is gonna be more dramatic I'm
not taking it more for a 23 and blend
out the top portion just to make sure
there's no harsh lines or edges I really
just don't like harsh lines when
blending or when doing any eye looks
even if I'm supposed to have a harsh
line I don't like it I'm actually taking
it from the bottom of my lower lash line
out because I'm gonna make this whole
entire look pretty smoky so you should
have something like this so far so now
I'm gonna go in with a eye base I'm
already primed but I'm going with the
different eye base I'm going to take the
pure I polish base topcoat in the shade
caviar it's a very very like dark
greenish gold shade and it
perfect because I want to go on my lid
I'm going to take the shade sippy sippy
which is a very deep mob brown but has
tons of gold glitter in it so I think
they'd be just perfect combined with
these so I'm going to take this pure I
polish with this little piece your
applicator I'm gonna put that on the lid
close to the lash line and blend it out
as well I'm just grabbing a fluffy brush
and blending out the edges of the eye
polish taking more of that man cat shade
I'm going to blend out the edges a
little bit just to make sure everything
is nice and blended and I'm going to be
going over that eye base with sippy
sippy and now I'm gonna take a little
packing brush I'm just going to take the
one that tart already provided in this
palette because just it's already here
and I'm gonna take the shade that sippy
sippy which is a very dark brown plum
with basically like gold greenish or
reflect glare in it and you have to be
careful because this this shadow is
pretty powdery only because it isn't a
lot of glitter in it so it will kick up
a lot so just be sure to really wipe off
the brush when you're doing it dust it
off with your finger and then Pat on and
do padding motions right over the
eyeshadow base that we used
okay guys usually have this so far it's
a very very very very intense smoky
outer corner I what I did off of camera
X I was trying to figure out how to like
blend out the crease without getting too
like blurred and blended together when I
grabbed was Dogman a little bit on and
4-3-3 and I blended right in between the
darkest part of the purple and my skin
tone just to give me some more life back
into the lip because everything was so
cool toned oh startegy look little bit
more like black I punched me in the eye
kind of thing if that ever starts to
happen to add a little bit more warmth
to look and it will literally save the
look I swear to you it will I'm just
kinda more feet m42 to just like a
little packing brush and the shade big
baby I'm gonna put it on the brow bone
just a little bit just to give me a
little bit of a brow lift right here
definitely just be careful with that
sippy sippy shade because it does have a
lot of glitter in it and there will be a
lot of follow if you aren't really
paying attention I did get a lot of
fallout when I was packing it on and it
was kind of ruining my makeup so I like
re like put on powder on my face just be
careful with it it's nothing I mean it's
a glittery shade most glittery shades
that fall out just a forewarning for you
guys so what we're gonna do is just
gonna keep blending out this crease to
make sure that there's no harsh edges I
wish had more lid space man this is not
another one more let's go ahead and do a
wing I feel like a wing will also help
as well to make everything a little more
cohesive and blended together so go
ahead and do a wing whatever kind of
wing you want to do if not I mean you
don't have to of course of course you
don't have to because just like if you
guys want to but I do want to I'm going
to take my Kat Von D trooper liner I'm
gonna create a wing from the bottom of
the lash line outwards like so it's
gonna go dramatically then okay just go
ahead start filling that in one vampy
ass-fuck okay cool so I'm gonna go ahead
and finish off with the eyes now I'm
gonna do the bottom of the eye
originally I was going to do
man Kat and keep it all cohesive and
purple down here but because I feel like
it all started getting to mesh together
with everything and I had a lot of
orange and warm tones to it to bring it
back to life I'm just going to continue
on with the orange and warm tones
underneath my lash line just to make
sure we don't like close off anything
and make it look too like black eye kind
of thing so I'm gonna mix natural
peaches and the Dogman again on my lower
lash line I'm gonna bring that all the
way in
to make sure everything look a little
bit more warm and alive I'll try my best
to do like a cool toned look but
honestly it's so easy to go from like
cool tone to dead in a second in a
 second it's so fast okay cool so
then I'm going to highlight a little bit
as well just because we got to do it we
have to do it I'm gonna take a more feet
M three to six and I'm actually gonna
take Gator wings I'll put that in the
inner corner just really give me some
life back to the eye and I'll waken
everything up a little bit on the brow
bone as well a very small amount so I
was gonna take a cream color liner in my
waterline which of course you guys can
do that would be so absolutely beautiful
but because this is greater girl as is
her palette and she's so bold and
intense and really really cool I'm gonna
take a bold waterline color I'm gonna
take the color pop crybaby the lavender
pencil I don't put that in my waterline
just to give me open awake luckily
because it is a light baby lavender
color it's still going to open up my
eyes but not be like the classic white
or beige color I don't I just I've been
wanting to do some more fun
incorporating some more fun colors so
this is what I'm gonna do
honestly you can barely even tell that
it's purple it just looks like a cool
lighter color amazing so go ahead and
curl your lashes and apply some mascara
and falsies if you would like okay guys
so this is what it looks like with the
lashes and the liner and everything is
on with mascara and everything I think
it turned out so freakin cool in it so
sexual and like smoky and very like come
hither bitch or you die kind of thing so
is what it looks like I'm going to do me
guys in to see what they look like up
close
and just for reference the lashes I'm
wearing are a Russian black buy new
bounce um and they have been my favorite
lashes recently I just am so loving them
so much and they I feel like they just
go with every single look so that's why
I've been liking them let's go and move
on to the lips now so I decided that I
want to go in with one of graveyard
Girls colors that she did with Tarte
this is in the shade Texas toast I'm
kind of nervous because I don't do codes
like this ever I don't like like those
gray G purple tones on my lips I just
think they don't look good on me I'm not
wear like a lip like this and a very
very long time if you guys go into my
channel you will notice that I do not
wear like greyish purple tones on my
lips ever literally ever you will not
see them on me so I'm going to try this
out I'm very very excited I want to try
it
am I gonna be brave for you guys in for
bunny I love you there's such a
beautiful Lucy lightweight texture what
are we thinking be honest I think it
looks so beautiful and if you're into
that cool tone like greyish purple type
tones on your lips like you're going to
be obsessed with this color and the
formula it's such a comfortable easy
lightweight formula and I think you guys
will really really like it and this is
the final look
