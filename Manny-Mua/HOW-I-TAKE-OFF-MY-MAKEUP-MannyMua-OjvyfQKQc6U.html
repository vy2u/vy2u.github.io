removing of all this glam on the face
I've actually never done a get on ready

always do in the bathroom because like
the bathroom is where I don't mind me
kima so now that I'm in my room
with like all this stop and this
computer 8 things and like the camera
the lights I'm a little nervous and not
any girl I have a little bowl of water
next to me so when a clean equi shocked
me to do a video together I was like you
know what let's do it I've never done it
get done ready with me video so I'm like
dude hell yeah let's do this and this is
the thing with me I don't know how it is
with other people but for me I'm not
scared of doing sponsored videos I'm not
scared doing sponsored content not at
all as long as it makes sense and I can
be true to myself and who I am as a
person I am NOT a fan of people doing
sponsored videos just for the sake of
getting paid that drives me fucking up
the wall crazy because it's not honest
you have to be honest in videos that's
just how it is
and since I'd love some of the clinic's
skincare already I'm like you know what
I'm totally down to do this with you
guys as long as I can do it first
impressions I have not used some of your
guys's products so I need to be able to
be as honest as possible and that's it
and that's or no deal and so they said
you know what it's totally cool let's go
ahead and do it we think you're gonna
love the products so let's try it out
and I'm like that's how it's done
brands if you ever watching this that is
how it's done do not try to force
youtubers into same things that they
shouldn't be saying who's with me give
this a like comment down below if you
are with me cuz you guys see the
sponsored videos you guys know you guys
see through the camera and you know it's
sponsored so why deny it
come on it is what it is I'm doing a
sponsored real Clinique Thank You clinic

the makeup might as well fucking filming
let's do this first impressions so if
you guys don't like sponsored videos or

you're new what's up a man you a and
welcome to my channel thank you guys for
being here
notice I am wearing my pink robe you
guys follow me on snapchat you guys know
this robe is on my body at all times
my mother and father like you need the
new damn robe and I'm like but I love
pink and I love it mine I think you guys
should help me name this row because I
weren't so often and I have grace in my
gray hoodie and you guys help me name
that so this pink robe it's a girl
it is a girl this one is a girl I feel
her feminine or all over me all the time
so what should we name her some people
are thinking like Rosa some people are
thinking like Aurora like just cue ask
them our names so let's come up with one
until then let's going into this video
this removing makeup video first things
first to start off with taking out the
lashes Oh nor doors like camera this for
you Oh goodbye iconic spy house lashes
now Nick what so now I am look basic as
hell I'm gonna start off with step
number one this is they take the day off
bomb by Clinique I love this that this
is why I agreed to this video because I
was like you know what I love this so
much that let's do it because this thing
is so good it is so good take the day
off bomb it slurry a cleansing balm
patterns actually the first one use this
and that I saw that I noticed using this
and he loved it he's like hey do you
have this and I'm like yeah I do I never
tried it though and he's like can you
give me it cuz I love it and I'm like no
I didn't you want to try it it reminds
me a lot of coconut oil and the way of
it takes off everything it's a bomb it's
a hard solid it turns into like a
liquidy consistency but it's non
comedogenic so that's really really cool
and you don't break out from using this
so that's why I like it so much this is
my one that I have used so you can see
it's had some love and it's about one of
the third way done yeah so we're gonna
dip your finger scrape your finger in
there that is totally fine and we're
gonna put that all oh my god this is so
weird taking off my makeup in my room
what I'm just going to literally make it
emollient so it starts off white turns
into like a little paste and you
literally just put it on and you just
start going to town you just go to town
basically you melt the makeup on your
face right over the lips uh-oh your eyes
too
I said I want at a time wow I should
have really done one at a time I was not
thinking correctly Oh me until take any
kind of makeup remover wife I just
doesn't matter which crimes to take a
blank one and a wipe away from your eyes
first look at that like that is Allah
that is Allah so basically this bomb
melts away all Eureka it literally eats
away at the powder it's a way to liquid
its way at everything and it just
disappears if you don't want to use a
little makeup remover that's totally
cool too you can learn just take a
little towel and that works absolutely
amazingly because again it's the bomb
that's really doing the work it's not
that I can move or the bomb is what's
melting it all away ok great so now that
we use the bomb take off everything as
you can see my face is literally like
completely cleaned with just the bomb
but we're not gonna stop as err we're
gonna continue on with little skincare
products that they provided me that you
guys so much clinical of you guys I
literally have a warm towel cloth and a
bowl of water in my room to just help
with like everything and this is white
look at this is white and look how
little product comes off with just the
bomb hmm okay cool so I'm just gonna
literally dampen my face a little bit
with this cowl and then we're gonna
cleanse we're gonna use the liquid
facial soap and the mild kind this is
just basically like their cleanser and
I'm just gonna take off my fingers comes
out how's it come out it comes out like
it just a nice jelly consistency oh it's
just some thickness okay so we're gonna
put that in the center and rub it
everywhere I like it I like that it
foams up oh maybe just me but I I'm a
huge fan of them things I'm like foam up
because I feel like it's actually
working and I know like tons of
cleansers work so great without bubbling
up but for some reason it just gives me
like a weird sense of satisfaction and I
do like it so so now that I drenched
this towel all over with water again I'm
just gonna wipe off the cleanser just
take it all off so far a plus on the
cleanser it felt absolutely amazing it's
very thick it's very heavy it like
cleans very well deep down and I love
that a bubbles up it makes me makes me
happy like it makes me happy when things
do that and it doesn't feel hmm doesn't
feel and doesn't make my skin feel too
dry either so that makes me extremely
happy because even though I'm oily I
like to be hydrated you guys know you
found that so next step step number
three we're going to be taking the
Clinique clarifying lotion and it says
for dry combinations
so I mean it's gonna be nice for people
that are dry I'm not drying but I like I
like being motorized so we're gonna take
the clarifying lotion and I believe this
is more like an exfoliating type lotion
it's like a very lightweight liquid
exfoliator but not too heavy it's very
lightweight and just to help clean the
skin of any other impurities that you
may have on it from the makeup and your
day and the smog and the things like
that if you live in LA smog was gonna
put that on the center of the nose and
go outwards ooh this is strong oh my
gosh is is strong so do not get this by
your eyes because it will stain make
sure to keep that by the perimeters of
your face whoa my nose feels like
fucking a baby but a cup I can't leave I
got extra dirt I thought it was clean as
clean could be but I thought wrong cool
so that's the last step it's not any
more of an intense alcohol e pepper
remover but my skin does feel very very
very cleansed I mean the second
ingredient is alcohol in this so it is
very very intense but it's going to
clean your face very deeply if you're
insensitive to alcohol in the face I
don't know this would be the best option
for you because again alcohol is a
drying agent but it's a very strong
cleansing agent so it's kind of like a
little give-and-take but on my skin it
works totally fine
I can emot-- just great and my skin
feels are very very very clean and I'm
diggin it there's only five steps but
the fourth step is going to be the
Clinique custom Repair Serum any serum I
am very happy with I loved serums you
must make me giddy like a schoolgirl in
church and we're just gonna put this all
over the face our smart serum responds
to the particular needs of your skin
targeting repair as needed where needed
I like that this is for tons of
different problems so that's gonna make
me very happy I have plenty of problems
to work with this feels so so good oh I
want to bathe my whole body especially
after that exfoliating step like this
makes you feel so refreshed and hydrated
Wow last and final step is waiting the
moisturizer of course this is going to
be the dramatically different
moisturizing lotion plus we're gonna pop
a couple of those pumps into the hand
heal a small face you're lucky you'll
have to use as much I have to use four
okay face lotion now oh that feels very
very silky and very smooth slides on
very easily it's not too thin it's not
too thick either it's not like
thick-ass moisturizer where it's like oh
my god I'm gonna fall asleep because
it's so thick kind of thing sleeping
moisturizer it's definitely not that
feels like a very middle range
moisturizer it's not too thin it's not
too heavy that's like a medium viscosity
moisturizer I'm just pressing and just
going out to press stuff into my skin so
I like to rub it as much because I feel
like I'm gonna create wrinkles that I
don't need that already had plenty dude
honestly my skin feels so hydrated does
it look like it's hydrated in like like
it's ready for the fucking night not
that I think it's not me and that's it
for this entire video that was it for
the entire get unready with me slash
trying out these cleaning products for
the first time I had not tried so many
these products but I hope you guys liked
it and this is a different video for me
