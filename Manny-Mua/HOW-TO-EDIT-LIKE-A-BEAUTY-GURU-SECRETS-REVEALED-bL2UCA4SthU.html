say I don't know anyway you guys how are
you guys doing today I'm really excited
by today's video because I'm gonna be
doing a teaching y'all had a facetune
slash edit some pictures because I
actually got asked a lot how I face
tuned and how I do my photos on
Instagram and on Twitter and things like
that and I actually was like talking
about something on Twitter and someone
asked me like to do a video showing you
guys how I face tune and I responded to
her and I was i dude you want to see
that and then so many people were like
do please yes like create a video that
is inspired by face tune it and it's
kind of like tips and tricks and things
that I do on my personal face tune so
we're gonna literally like take a photo
and we're gonna face tune it right now
and I will show you guys exactly what I
do to face tune my pictures hello I have
a new tattoo in case you guys are and
cuz you saw this earlier this is my
tattoo I love it so much I've been
tattoo did this it's fucking amazing
and my parents astrological signs up
here and I mean they can air in my
little brother's down here so I got a
family tattoo and I love it so much so
cuz you guys to see it like pop into our
just got a couple days ago which is why
I have the second skin on but anyways
guys that's what today's video is going
to be I'm going to be teaching guys how
I face to in a picture or just kind of
like some like editing 101 when it comes
to a picture I am in no way saying that
you guys need to edit your photos like
not at all but I actually really really
enjoy editing my photos like if I don't
like something about how I look in some
moment I don't mind editing it out I
don't have a pimple which I do right
here cover it up or nothing on if I have
a pimple I'm like do I don't want to
deal with that shit I'm gonna take it
off so I literally just like delete it
or if I'm just like not happy with how I
look in that moment if I can alter it
just to like kind of put my best foot
forward
I don't mind it you know I'm confident
into what the way I look and I'm
confident in myself in general but why
not edit a photo like there's nothing to
me nothing wrong with it as long as it's
not being too deceptive and you're not
making it look like you're a different
person completely other than that I
think you're completely fine and if
anyone gives you shit for editing a
photo or face tuning yourself
welcome literally it's not that big of a
deal really like there's worse problems
in the world trust me we have Trump as a
president there are worse things in the
world than me face winning a photo yeah
that's a nice video is going to be as
always if you guys do like this video
you guys do not like me please don't
fucking watch it no Joe with that
there's no point to watch me if you
don't like me I'm living today's right
eye though by the way but if you guys
that do like this video please go and
click subscribe to my channel if you're
not already and if
new what's up man anyway and welcome to
my channel thank you so much for being
here I really appreciate everything
Eirene Champlin yeah it's gonna get into
this how I face you in a picture
beauty guru teaches how to face too in a
picture I might call myself a beauty
guru but like okay so we let me just
take a photo right now literally you
have my phone here we're gonna take a
picture if you're taking a photo I like
taking a photo in snapchat so I just
pulled up my snapchat because I feel
like the quality of the photo for some
reason just looks a little bit better so
basically I'm gonna start screen
recording right now screen recording I'm
screen recording this is frickin weird
anyway so that's me this is what I look
like on snapchat this is my face is what
it looks like I think it looks pretty
fucking good if I do by myself okay so
now I go to the camera roll and you can
see this photo like with the camera it
looks a lot more clear and it's really
pretty and gives you more of actually a
real life like what it actually looks
like like in camera two you guys can see
this is what it actually looks like but
I enjoy the snapchat want a little bit
more cuz I just feel like it just looks
prettier and there's almost like a
filter over it like it just gives me a
little bit more of a gun and it's zoomed
in as well and I really like that so I
mean wipe my screen messy bitch I'm
going to go ahead and take a photo right
now okay so we got a pic you see what we
get you right here have a picture of me
looking snatched to the ground to save
that take another one let's take another
picture just have extras just in case
overexposure come on I clicked on my
finger you don't have to throw in the
thumb and shit like that who is she who
is she that is a vision honey this is
with no tune by the way saving that one
too let's take another one I like to
like turn my head and show like a hard
jock boom hard jaw I don't look like
this in real life but I'm taking some
pigs to make it seem like a to you I
like that one I like that photo I'm
gonna end up editing that one so these
are my little editing apps these are the
ones I use the most often I use facetune
afterlight pic frame font candy vsco cam
and studio not only do I use them for
Instagram but I also use them for
YouTube as well so I'm gonna go to face
tune I'm gonna open face tune and bam we
have facing right here this is what she
looks like and I already have the screen
recording going and everything so we are
gonna go ahead and start the face -
we're pulling up our photo right here
this is what we took this is me there's
me and my bowling outfit anyway you guys
okay so we have a photo right here this
is it zoomed in so what can we change
about this pic so basically what I like
to do with my photos this is a good one
but I like to kind of like snatch
everything up so I go to this tool
reshape which is at the bottom right
reshape I click refine and I zoom in to
a base and say okay what do I need help
with I personally really really enjoy
lowering my hairline because I got hair
surgery and my hairline is always in
something that I'm never I've never been
the most comfortable of like with what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna lower my hair
like I'm gonna zoom in and start to drag
my little hairline down a little bit I
just want it to be a little bit less
massive so she's dragging her hairline
down and I'm using the refine tool so
that you see reshaping those three
options reshape refine and resize with
refine that's gonna do like little tiny
movements reshape soon to be like big
movements tiny movements is for refine
please oh we pulled that in so we can
look before after I'm clicking the
before-and-after button do you all see
that yeah yeah
strong okay so now what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna go into like the gobble of my
cheek there's some gobble there okay I'm
gonna pull that in with refine and do
same thing pull her in I want to pull
that gobble just ingest enough nothing
crazy where its altering a pick but
we're gonna pull the fucking gobble in
and then we're into the jaw same thing
we're gonna make that jaw a little bit
sharper and every time after I do
something I will check it again I will
literally click the thingy okay am I
going too crazy am I going to ham I love
to pull in the back of the neck that's
the one thing I love to do cuz I just
feel like it makes me look a little bit
thinner a little bit so basically guys
what we're learning from here is that
refine I'm gonna pull my ears in a
little bit - I've always been a little
bit insecure by my hair so we're pulling
in our ears a bit we're really gonna go
in y'all like we're really going in this
is like what might what I really do on
my pictures so I'm actually really
excited for her to see this like she
goes in mind you did I think I look
snatched before I did I honestly think
my before photo is actually really
really really pretty so anyway I digress
now we're gonna take away some pimples
like taking away some pimples and
somehow people actually really really
want to learn how to do because it's
like one thing that I can my mom is like
how the fuck do I knock off a pimple or
like any of my friends like when they
asked me to face you in their photos
like you take off like this spot
anything like that so we're looking at
the photo right now we're gonna go down
and we're gonna click we're gonna move
the little guy down over to patch see
this lil guy patch so we have a little
patch tool we're gonna zoom in to where
we have texture so we can see I have
texture I'm a dude
have texture esportes yeah so I'm gonna
go ahead and do one in and I'm gonna go
ahead and just literally press on to the
little guy and for example this little
pimple right here is driving me crazy
we're gonna press onto him and we're
gonna move the other guy around to pick
from a spot that doesn't have a pimple
so for example you view if you go back
and forth you can see that pimple is now
gone boom boom boom when it zoom on in
we're gonna do another guy right there
we can also like resize it by zooming in
and out with your two fingers we're
gonna take another big pimple it's what
the highlight is what kind of emphasizes
pimples so that's just a forewarning so
when you're pulling for patch you want
to do it right next to what you just
pulled from because that's gonna be the
same exact color so we don't want to be
like too deceptive and too off you know
I'm sayin's we're gonna grab those
little areas we're just gonna pool we're
gonna pull the patch we're gonna pull
the badge so I'm knocking off all these
pimples you know I feel like when it
comes to texture and things like that
that's just something that I don't like
I don't enjoy seeing all my texture on
my skin all the time you know I have
horace bumpy skin and i don't want that
to be like what people focus on in my
photos i take the liberty to kind of go
ahead and knock off some pimples I'm
still going I'm still knocking off and
I'm still just grabbing from areas
around as you guys can see in the screen
recording I'm just grabbing from areas
that are the same in color or brightness
or something like that and patch is
actually really really easy to use it
just kinda takes some practice and that
is that ooh
let's knock out that whole section right
there I do not feel bad in any way shape
or form doing this at all I'm gonna be
saying this off the entire video but if
this is what I want to put forth on the
internet that's what I'm gonna do I'm
not gonna like feel guilty for editing a
photo of mine because I enjoy the
process of editing a photo as well I
really really think it's really fun and
it kind of puts the whole picture
together it's not just like me showing
off my makeup it's like the whole
presentation of a photo I just feel like
it looks really really good and its
really really presentable so that's just
my personal opinion so we're gonna leave
it at that I think the patch is good now
when you click the before and after you
can see there's been a couple changes oh
fuck so we're gonna go into smooth now
smooth is another type of tool that will
help us a lot
smooth does some Buddhist things smooth
is what I like to see I never used the
tool smoother which is right next to it
there's smoothing they're smoother I
never used smoother because I feel like
that's too smooth or I'm like Gerling
basically for me personally I like to
smooth the area around my face now but
like this part of my face here does I
have like cheeks obviously
this part is like indented from the side
of my mouth you can see the side of my
mouth so what I like to do I kind of
like to smooth that over so what you're
gonna do you're gonna take your finger
and you're gonna lightly smooth over I'm
smoothing over my beard area yeah you
might have to worry about that but areas
that you have like that are more porous
and areas days want to smooth out I
could just tap so it's not like too
intense
lightly smoothing over any areas I feel
like a little bit too porous going over
the forehead a little bit you know it's
nothing too crazy
I'm clicking before and after now boom
it just like a slight it's such a subtle
difference but it makes a big difference
when it comes to like you editing your
photo using like color and stuff like
that after so that is what that is okay
so now we're gonna go into the tool tone
and that is another a bit like this tone
is probably like my egg top three tools
in facetune tone will save a bitches
life it will resuscitate you if you are
drowning tone will do that for you I'm
not kidding I'm no kini we just click
tone basically tonal lets you apply
colour to anything you want to apply
color to for me personally I have a
greenish hue and I mustache area because
I shave but I have like that blue
undertone because I fucking dude
basically for photos I don't like that I
don't like seeing the blue undertone in
my beard it's what I like to do is I'll
take picker the tool picker basically
lets you pick certain spots of the face
I'm clicking around so you can see for
example I click my eyes it's like a red
the palate says red if I click a
highlight area it's like a violet light
pink or we click a skin tone or a
fucking beard we get brown it just kind
of depends on the area too I pick from
the heads act spot so I like to pick
from my chin and I use tone and I go
over my beard area to knock off that
bluish greenish undertone so I'm
literally just lightly using my finger
going over so you can see I'm going
before and after boom it's not a huge
difference this is not something that's
like oh my god revolutionary what the
fact this is just something I personally
like to do because it frustrates me when
I have the blue undertone in my beard a
lot of you guys will have to deal with
this so if I feel like if I go overboard
I just take this tool erase and I just
like kind of dot over in here is I feel
I'm like girl you need to calm your tits
as you can see now the photo has a
little bit less of a blueish undertone
in my beard area so we have this so far
this we have boom boom boom boom tone
tone tone tone that's wonder so we're
gonna do now we're gonna go into tone
and we're gonna use that as a
highlighting tool to emphasize our
highlight a bit more space we're gonna
go in with tone so basically what I like
to do with tone I to emphasize my
highlight so as you can see like my
highlight looks
pretty blinding already at the blinding
in person it looks really really really
intense but I feel like sometimes when
you're taking a photo
it doesn't emphasize your highlight the
way you want it to it doesn't do shit so
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna actually in
just intensified my highlight a little
bit I'm gonna take the color bar and I
move it on over to the left and I'll
take like a really light like milky
shade right on my click tone again zoom
into my cheek and I'm just gonna
highlight I'm trying to tap very lightly
I'm Jim a tap tap in little areas to
emphasize the highlight a little bit
more clear just feel like it looks
prettier when it pops up a little bit
better
as you can see boom I'm gonna go
before-and-after look at that boom cuz
basically that's what my hat looks like
in real life book sometimes the photo
just doesn't capture it good enough I'm
gonna do that on the brow bone as well a
little bit on the brow bone my brow bone
is actually gnarly as a fucking person
and I'm gonna do the inner corner a
little bit as well just to lightly press
that and I must also highlight the nose
I'm just gonna go right in the spots I
already have highlight in so basically
the tip of my nose the bridge of my nose
right there a little bit down the center
right there so let's see that that's
already like intense for me I'm look
like a race I'm gonna race in certain
areas I think that's a little bit much
because if you can see right there boom
we just intensified everything a bit
more than it was I'm gonna get smoother
again I'm gonna smooth it out by my
highlight on the cheekbones really it's
a little bit intense there we go that's
better so he's now one click before now
if you're one click boom oh my god let
me see all that texture that was here
before look at it now
god damn clothing bag about tone again
as well is it for example if you have a
dark under-eye and you're like so
frustrated with that you're like fuck do
I can't get rid arc under-eye what you
can do is you can take picker again you
pick from a different area of the face
and you can use tone to mask the fact
that you have a darker under-eye I don't
really have any dark under-eye right now
in this photo sometimes I do and for
example I'm gonna sue them into the eye
at like Tibia scorner right here I'm
grabbing tone from like right underneath
my cheek and I'm gonna kind of cover up
that darkness see that right there I'm
just kind of covering it up a little bit
I want to look like I have some sleep
throwing in that tone to make it look
like I've had some rest you know like I
have slept for hours and hours and hours
who's that who's that who else looking
real fresh
looking real fucking fresh y'all yn is
great for whitening your teeth whitening
your eyeball that's what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna whiten my teeth
I always show my teeth in photos because
I just do like I'm posing with my mouth
open I'm not like trying to push up my
lips or have my mouth closed I'm like i
resting my bottom teeth Joe I can't
avoid it I will always have my bottom
teeth showing in photos it is what it is
so I'm whitening my teeth and I'm
whitening the whites of my pie to be a
little bit wider a little bit wider just
brighten up a bit so now we're going
back to tones I told you tones will save
our asses in maniac situations pulling
it all the way back to the white so now
what I'm gonna do is I'm actually go
into my eye and lighten my cuz my eye
and really was actually very very light
as you guys didn't see I have like a
colored light green hazel eye and in
photos and never shows like a you cannot
tell I have a light eye well I could do
that take Tony I go to the whitest white
and I click my eyes slightly lose press
around it a little bit to emphasize that
I actually do have a lighter eye than it
shows I try not to go overboard with
this it's real easy to go overboard boom
I just look lighter and they look like
they do in real life I mean maybe it's a
little bit lighter in here but it's a
fucking photo okay fucking cares I'm
lightening it if I went a fucking minute
damn I'm like smooth I'm smooth out my
neck a little bit I mean I can be smooth
there okay so this what we have so far
guys this is what we have our photo at
after all the editing is said and done
this is her as you can see I've touched
over your life the phone doesn't what
I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna actually
write out the background you guys would
probably notice this a lot of people do
this on Instagram for me what I like to
do is I actually keep the focus on my
face and the coloring of my face I've
knock out all the coloring of the
background so I'm gonna go all the way
over to filters it's how I like to do it
I click filters and I go over to BW
silver I click that holding it's white
it up and I'm like oh my gosh I'm pale
I'm a ghost right to that you click wipe
and it gives you these options it gives
you wipe apply fill clear so as you go
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to leave
it on this on the leave it on wipe and
what I can do so now you can do is you
can literally wipe the color back into
your face and keep everything else
black and white so what I'm gonna do is
I'm going to knock off all the black and
white that's around my face and my ear
and literally every spawn is zoom on in
be real it's an infamous Mormon
intricate part right here it's ain't
ricotta
it's intricate ah that's a fake where I
just made that up basically that's not
much is gonna why
away all the black and white nests from
my face from my hair from my clothes
sometimes I white out my clothes - I
don't mind that is well but for this I
actually like the color of my shirt so
I'm gonna keep that in it I'm wiping off
away and giving myself all the colour
back in my skin
I'll go about half way it's like I can't
fit the whole thing in the photo anyway
I'm cooking before and after before
after before after
I like the after I like that it just
looks really really focused and honed it
on me so I'm gonna click save that
little checkmark it saves it so now the
before and after photos this boom boom
boom another Twilight to use a lot is
the tool detail and imma zoom onion onto
my eyes I'm just gonna kind of add
detail to my lashes I'm gonna lightly
press over my lashes so you can add a
little bit of detail there so you guys
didn't see you liked my look I actually
have lower in top lashes I don't look
like I am missing here that doesn't do a
lot but it just gives you a little bit
of a little bit of pop so I feel like as
long as I'm not altering my shadow and
things like that
I ain't can be just as happy doing the
face tune in okay so this is what we
have our photo hat this is what I like
I'm look like so now I have to do is go
to the right top corner you click save
to camera roll and boom we save to the
camera roll and that's what it Instagram
now you can literally just go in and
filter the fuck out of it if you want to
or if not that's all good I had a little
bit of saturation here and some contrast
I love to add sharpen because I want to
show like I still do have texture on my
skin I don't want to show that I have
like a smooth flat ass surface I think
that's really like deceptive I think
that's when it's like oh girl you have
texture when it's over smooth I think
that's like a really annoying thing ash
is my personal opinion I think it's
annoying like the lower the shadows a
bit this is just me now I'm going in out
of some brightness and this is what we
gotta follow to be you guys that is the
final image that's her and it is fuck
I'm gonna save the dress
and that in it so I basically just
wanted to show you guys what I do on
face Tunas specifically there's a bunch
of face tune tools I can literally do an
entire series on face tune alone because
there's so much that goes into it but I
feel like what I just showed you guys is
kind of like a great beginner guide on
like how to do things but it's really
just about you guys playing around with
the app I got this app a while ago I
don't exactly remember how much it costs
back then I think I paid like three
bucks for it yeah I think it's really
really great app I think it's awesome
and I wish they were fucking sponsoring
this fucking video but they're wrecking
it anyways you guys that is today's
video because had fun watching it again
you guys do not have to edit your pics
at all it doesn't really matter it
really really really does it if
want to keep your pics how they are if
you want to show whatever you want to
show that's great too but I honestly see
my Instagram and my grid in my timeline
as a piece of art piece of work you know
and I had something I actually work on
so that's why I added my pictures I want
to put like my best foot forward like I
was saying earlier I want to just show
the best that I can cuz I felt get out -
Instagram is for its for to show like a
fun beautiful photo and it looks really
great but like snapchat it's the stories
YouTube like this is just me being me
this is my real ass fucking lied this is
my real ass bitch this and you can see
exactly what I look like in real life
and I know a lot of other influencers
think the same thing I know James is the
exact same way James Charles yet it's
his photos and he's very proud of it
just like oh I am Laura Nikita
Gaby all my friends specifically
nikkietutorials so many people edit
their photos and just to put their best
foot forward and I really really really
love it as long as people aren't going
like crazy over where that guy was
saying making your skin look like
play-doh and like so smooth that where
you can't see anything or even makeup I
think that it's totally fine and if you
don't be with me that's totally fine -
that's the beauty of an opinion everyone
has one but they're not always the exact
same and that is that I hope you guys
enjoyed today's video I know it's
probably to be a long one if you guys
have any questions about anything else
let me know in the comments bar below if
you guys wanted me to go a little bit
more in depth if you guys want me to
show you guys certain different things I
can definitely make that happen just let
me know okay truce of the night or day
wherever you guys are and I will catch
you guys in my next video bye guys I
love you so much
that photo looks so good before I look
you know who's a man okay that's all you
can't fuck with me if you don't know
what PB and J otter is oh my god being
height I got my cards got chills I feel
like I'm in a bowling league so what I'm
giving a lesson I'm really I'm teaching
my fucking bitches right now yeah it
looks pretty
happy tune in happy face tuning I love
you guys I gotta go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
