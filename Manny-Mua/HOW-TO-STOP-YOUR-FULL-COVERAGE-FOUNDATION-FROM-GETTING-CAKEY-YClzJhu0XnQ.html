today's video as you can see from the
title is going to be a how-to on how I
get my makeup my full coverage as makeup
that I wear literally all the time to
all the events I go to to the outings to
the mean greets everything I do whenever
I'm doing a full coverage look to not
look cakey throughout the day or look
not cakey at all basically I know that
my foundation is full coverage I
understand that and I know that but the
point of this video is to show how you
can keep your full coverage foundation
from not looking cakey and heavy on the
skin is it full coverage hell yeah hell
yeah it is as you can see there's like
what pours bitch like they ain't
existing at this point but we want to
make sure that the foundation that we
have on the skin is not super super
kinky and heavy looking and I thought I
converse that with today's look with
still looking really really pretty and
natural I do get a lot of compliments
from you guys in person when you guys do
meet me that you guys say that my skin
looks really smooth and pretty and I
really appreciate it thank you guys so
much and I just wanted to share my
information of what I do with you guys
this is also I guess an update on my
full coverage routine I suppose as well
but this is what I do to make sure that
my face does not look cakey or heavy
throughout the day as always if you guys
don't this video if you guys do not like
me please don't watch it you
know let gentleman thing I say in every
single video do not watch this video if
you guys do not like it because I don't
want to subject you guys to watch
something that you guys do not want to
see but if you guys you like this video
please give it a thumbs up click like
right now like it and that subtract to
my channel if you aren't already yeah
guys it's going to get into this video
on how to get your full coverage makeup
to not look cakey or heavy on D skin
okay so it's not on today's video I'm
going to be walking you through how to
make your full coverage foundation
basically not look cakey at all or at
least making it as less kicky as
possible even though your full coverage
is so we're gonna be doing today
so with making your skin not looking so
cakey not so heavy you want to make sure
that your skin is very very moisturized
because you want to pick up on any dry
patches cuz that's a big tell of the
fact they wearing a lot of foundation is
when it picks up on a dry patch so make
sure your skin is moisturize and primed
I'm moisturize already I'm gonna use a
primer I'm gonna use a silicon based
primer
because it makes it for a lot better of
a slip I'm going to take the benefit
Porefessional for example when using a
pore filling a primer it works so so so
well and making sure you get the most
smooth
and flat surface as possible on the face
you want to really make sure that you
work some type of silicon based primer
into your skin especially on the areas
they have the most pores for example for
me to be in the t-zone where my pores
look like this it's just an exercise
that I like to do just ensure
motorisation I'm gonna take the Smashbox
photo finish primer water spray a low
spritz on the face not only are we
locking in that so Tamizh try my we're
gonna go ahead and add a lot of moisture
and just awakeness to the skin and
really just kind of like pow think of it
as like you're chewing gum and it's like
that bursa like it's like that for your
face I think just a my mind that's how I
think in my mind so we're gonna let that
settle into skin real quick this is an
excessive part of my routine I like to
use a couple of foundations I like to
use between three and four foundations
with my entire face I know that's so
 crazy and you do not need to do
this at all I'm just going to be using
different methods that work for my skin
personally and the effect I like to use
so for example i'm gonna be using neem
Loreal Pro matte and fallible in the
t-zone specifically on my nose and a
little bit on my forehead and I'm gonna
go in with different foundations for
different reasons
I love the infallible for mattifying my
skin and lasting all day on my skin this
is in the shade 103 natural buff it's
not my exact shade but it's the closest
I have found to match me so I'm taking a
little Beauty Blender I'm gonna buff
this into the skin I really make sure we
pouncing this in and for the nose I like
to make sure I'm using a Beauty Blender
and not a brush because I feel like it's
so much better to pick up excess product
with a Beauty Blender on a nose girl the
brush does not it does not play
well with my nose so then for the other
parts of my face so as you can see that
foundation is down it's really nice
mattifying foundation it's not too too
matte but it's a nice really pretty sad
matte finish I think it looks very very
nice I'm gonna be taking the hourglass
vanish stick and this is gonna go on my
cheeks specifically I like to do three
stripes right there three stripes one
two three a little bit on my bearded
area cuz have that blue discoloration
from my facial hair a little bit on the
chin a little bit on the sides of my
temples and one little stripe on my nose
for added coverage for added coverage
and for health wealth and happiness so
I'm keeping the majority of the coverage
in the center of my face so basically in
these areas right here I like to keep
the most of the coverage because I just
think that the coverage there is the
most necessary for me for example for me
I don't really need a lot of coverage
over my beard like I just don't hey if
you're a female watching this intern
have to worry about that as much by to
keep the most of the product and the
most of the foundation everything
concealer and the tease
because that's why I have the most
problem areas okay so what I'm gonna do
them to take a little bit of your air
flash and the shape 200 spritz I'm gonna
do a little bit on the cheeks a little
bit on the temps and now what you want
to do I'm gonna take a buffing brush and
this is gonna really ensure that we keep
all the coverage there but it's gonna
mix very very very nicely the
foundations are going to mix very well
they're gonna play nicely together
because we're going to do is we're just
gonna press and Pat this foundation and
as you can see I'm just gonna Bluff out
downwards over the beaded area I don't
need extra coverage on the beard because
I have a beard like what's the
 point we're gonna make sure that
the coverage stays on the areas I don't
have much facial hair so this is what
you have so far as just the base as you
can see the base looks very very pretty
very satin almost very glowy the finish
I love that hourglass foundation stick
because the coverage is so full and it's
so nice and so pretty but I love the joy
our faster does give you a luminosity of
a finish so really when you mix these
two together you get a full coverage
luminous finish and I think it just
looks absolutely beautiful it looks
almost skin like skin like a skin like
ass walk in like faux covers can be but
now that I have the foundation down I'm
going to go ahead and press over with
that Beauty Blender and just literally
just lightly press on top of the skin
pick up any excess product that might be
left over without picking up too much
and without taking away any coverage I'm
just pressing fullest felt coverage like
fools but it's not looking cakey
which is what we want which is what we
want
so now for concealer I'm gonna go in
with a dark shape tape and let you guys
know I use this all the time I
absolutely love it I'm gonna take a
dollop right underneath my eye right
underneath my eye where I need the most
coverage a little bit on the forehead
down the center of the nose I can do on
the smile lines as well for me I need to
put in the smile lines because I need
something that will crease a little bit
less than foundation well on the t-zone
on my chin and on my moved off almost -
so now it's also really important so
when I boil can see that I don't use a
brush actually really like to use a
sponge for this because I feel like with
concealer it's really really really
really really easy to look cakey so
quickly luckily the tour concealer is
actually pretty good and not looking
cakey but not all concealers are like
that so we're gonna do is going to press
this concealer in welcome UT blender and
we're really making sure that any of the
excess concealer that we don't need
there its Amy picked up by the sponge so
this is why we're using a sponge for
this method
sorry my friends it texted me so now
we're gonna do is we're gonna take a
really lightweight powder we're gonna
cook underneath the eyes I'm going to be
taking the RCM a note color powder
specifically for underneath my eyes and
my smile lines that's why I like to use
the power specifically I'm gonna take it
on a sponge I think it's really really
important to take your powders on a
sponge if you really want to avoid a
cakier look for underneath your eyes
give you my eyes open I'm going to look
at my mirror and myself I'm gonna set
from the back of my eye going into the
eye I just like less wrinkles form when
you're setting this way so I'm gonna
forget and I'm like whatever but for the
sake of this video I really want to show
you guys this method because I do think
that it really works sending your eye
backward instead of setting it from the
front back sending it from this way on I
feel like really diminishes the wrinkles
a little bit more I don't know why it
does but it just follows my own
the wrinkles just sit different so we're
gonna do is we put that there I'm gonna
put that says smile lines specifically
the RCM a powder areas that crease a lot
RCM a powder that's what we want to use
a really lightweight finely milled
powder the areas I put the RCM a powder
don't have as much oil on me like for
example the nose and the forehead I need
to do a different powder because they
produce a lot more oil and the are same
a powder does not really keep my oils at
bay throughout the day even if I'm
cooking it it just doesn't so what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna keep it cooking
here on the sides of the face as you can
see boom cooking on underneath my eyes
and then my smile lines but for my nose
and for my forehand I'm gonna be taking
the cover FX loose setting powder this
is honestly one my favorite loose
setting powders ever it's so fantastic
its talc free which means it's not as
heavy you guys honestly this powder make
some shook it's such a finely
milled beautiful powder and what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna take a powder puff
and for the nose and for the forehead
and the rest of the face we're going to
set in with this powder puff where
Liberty should have press and this is
another trick when it comes to not cakey
foundation you don't want to disrupt the
foundation underneath the powder that is
gonna make it look like it's a cakey or
heavier foundation because your
soudanese streaks it's just not gonna
look as pretty that's smooth so we
really want to make sure that you're
pressing into the skin now we're gonna
leave this for about 10 minutes to cook
into the skin and make sure that the
powders are as set into the skin as
possible during this time if I'm doing
makeup usually what I'll do is I'll do
my brows while I'm cooking my face and
once I'm done with the brows I'll wipe
off the powder so when we join
I do my brows off of camera real quick
and that we'll be right back to show you
what I do once the powder is settled
into the skin a little bit more okay
guys so it's been about 10 minutes and I
finished my brows off a camera I just
did a quick brow they look a mess I'm
sorry they was in my lab she did not
want him to finish the brow she
up my brow it's fine the eye can see on
the viewfinder right now the majority of
the powder is actually underneath my
eyes still from the cooking so I'm gonna
take a little brush and wipe this away
so there's no excess powder lying around
and then I'm gonna be taking a large
brush and this is like my Holy Grail
right now I've been loving this so much
this is the Mac medium golden
mineralized skinfinish I talked about a
recently in a favorites video I just
love this powder so much because it
gives you a lifelike finish to the skin
again and I think that's really really
important for a full coverage look and
the mineralized skinfinish will do that
to you
so I'm going to get more feet to a large
brush I'm just going to literally run it
in this and I'm gonna brush off any of
the excess powder that I might have on
the rest of the face and I'm starting on
the red parameters because this is a
little bit darker than my skin okay guys
so I went ahead and I applied my bronzer
highlight blush off of camera this is
what the face looks like right now
everything is still very full coverage
it's very very pretty it's very heavy
it's heavy as but the point is to
not look cakey as okay so so we're
doing right now so now what we're gonna
do is we're to take a little bit of a
setting spray any setting sway works so
you definitely wanna make sure you use a
setting spray to make sure that all the
powders that are on your face are left
over on the skin melt into the skin a
little bit more that's a very very key
thing about setting your face is that
not only does it set it and make it last
longer
it helps melt in the powders on the face
so it'll be a little bit more dewy in
skin like so so we're gonna do now I'm
gonna take the Milani make it last
setting spray spray this on the
mug just as much as you want that was
about enough for me maybe a little
little too here good we look to pop
again yeah okay guys and this is what
the skin looks like right now I'm gonna
go ahead and zoom in so you guys can see
what it looks like up close it's very
very full coverage but it looks very
very smooth and pretty and not cakey so
that's kind of the point of this whole
entire video and this is how it'll look
literally all day long not to brag at
all but I do get a lot of compliments on
my skin whenever I meet you guys in
person I get a lot of compliments you
guys are always like oh my god your skin
looks so perfect and I think you guys I
really really appreciate when you guys
say that to me but I really do think
that's because of the routine that
been doing recently it looks nice and
full coverage and beautiful but not
cakey and heavy on the skin around my
beard does it look a little cakey yeah
it does because I have facial hair but
if you don't have facial hair it's not
gonna look that crazy on you but you can
see a little bit of more residual on the
facial hair but that's unavoidable I
just want you guys to look mostly here
and just see that though my skin is full
coverage is it's not cakey and
heavy looking and that's the point and
yeah guys that's it for the entire video
hope you guys had fun watching another
side note this is another thing as well
throughout the entire day I have to wear
my makeup sometimes for like 12 hours on
end and I will get oily too of the day
this is just a tidbit of information
from me to you what you guys want to do
is you want to make sure that you block
off the excessive oil before you add
powder to it if you add powder to your
skin because it's oily it's gonna kick
up and look a little bit more heavy so I
like to do for example if I like I'm out
of like those little those little like
pads a little rice pads I'll go to a
bathroom and pull out that like
sheet for the toilet
I'll pull one out and I'll blot my nose
and like the t-zone area I'll blot it to
take off the excess oil and then I'll
add powder on top of it it literally
looks as if you just did your makeup all
over again like it looks so fresh and
pretty when you take off the oil and add
powder on top do not add your powder on
top of your oily face so think of it as
this way like you're literally adding
more powder on top of your face without
taking off that excessive oil layer so
it's going to bunch up underneath so try
to make sure that you're doing that to
prevent a cake your face but I hope this
video helped at all I feel like I was
really really talkative and very much
like talking through in this video I
hope it's not too long I hope it's not
too boring but I really just want to
inform you guys what I do to make sure
that my skin is not a cakey mess
throughout the entire day and I really
really does work for me a lot so if you
