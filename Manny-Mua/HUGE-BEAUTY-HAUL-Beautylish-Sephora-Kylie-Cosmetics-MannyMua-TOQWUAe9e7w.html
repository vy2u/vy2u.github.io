today's video is going to be a huge-ass
haul video I've not filmed a haul video
in forever you guys don't know this I
always unbox things on my snapchat I
always do hauls on my snapchat
I'll leave my section I think down right
here somewhere just floating in the hair
but I always do snapchat and boxing's
all the time I wanted to talk about
these new items on a youtube video not
on snapchat cuz I'm like I mean how many
snapchat hauls can i friggin do really
you know I wanted to bring it to YouTube
so this is what I'm doing
I actually partnered up with beauty list
into this video they sent me a huge
amazing package and I'm so excited to
show you guys them because honestly
butyl ish is like actually literally one
my favorite carrier brands you know to
me like there's like brands like Sephora
and Ulta that carry other brands Beauty
lish is a brand that carries other
brands and I love them their customer
service is amazing like what they
represent is amazing and the brands that
they have at their store is
amazing so I just want to do it a quick
unboxing for them with Beauty lish and I
also have stuff from Sephora and from
Kylie cosmetics so I cannot wait to show
you guys what I have in stock in here so

man yummy way and welcome to my channel
thank you guys for being here and let's
go and get into this beauty lish Sephora
and Kylie cosmetics haul video
before I get started on opening a beauty
lish stuff I want to mention real
quickly that they have this really cool
thing that is called flex payments and I
talked about before on my last haul with
Beauty lish and with other stuff but
they have this thing where he spent over
$100 and you really can't afford the
hundred dollars at that moment they will
let you pay in 3 payments so I just
think that is literally so cool they'll
let you like literally like flex pay
like it's like almost like a credit like
you get to pay when you guys can like
once a month I don't know how it works
really but the fact they even have that
is so cool and that's another reason I
want to talk about Beauty lish because
they're just so cool I love when brands
do things like that I really try to help
their consumer as much as they can and
readers does that so thank you guys I
beuliss for white to work with me
because I love you I love your
own would you want to screech a little
 science yeah okay I'm strong
with some skincare items for her
I've been Heyman lobbying first thing is
the Cicely Black Rose cream mask Jeffery
talks about this all the time and I used
at his house and it was so amazing and I
had no idea I'd do this even carried
Cicely I loved Sicilies products it's
like I'm really nice like horses from
where's his brand from because it's like
really Halen spensive where's the phone
this is Meghan Krantz like this is
 I guess halo right like like
really halo right like night you know
person right honestly this Rebecca is
really really great and really wanting
to try it out for myself so I got one of
these I had two reget the embryo Lee's
Hydra emotion this is what I use
whenever I go to events and I need a
moisturizer for my face this is a
moisturizer but it's a mattifying
moisturizer and this is my favorite
mattifying moisturizer I've ever tried
Patrick is actually the one that turned
me on to this and I literally use it
every single time I go to an event or I
do makeup for a day I needed to last the
whole day I use this as like my
moisturizer slash primer and it works so
good the embryo Lee's Hydra emulsion
matte I grabbed two things from Anna
Tsui I never even seen Anna Sui products
until I saw once on like Instagram while
scrolling and they are the cutest
packaging I got one of the lipstick this
is the Anna Tsui lip V lipstick look at
this packaging no no it looks
like a little Suckerfish a little star
shooting star
let's try swatching I've never oh my god
never tried making them
creamy and stunning and smells like
roses packaging really gets me cuz you
guys know I love that like really pretty
like Japanese esque like gay as hell
kind of look and that's what Ana so he
does and I'm like this is my so I got
that one and that is in the Shana
301 301 what is next after that Anna
Tsui mirror like a little hand mirror
because I saw it I want it to frickin
scream she looks so cute
oh my hell this reminds me of
like Beauty and the Beast because has a
little rose on the back it's just like a
black beautiful little mirror I'm done
with this I'm done with you I
was doing I snagged two of the Charlotte
Tilbury matte revolution Hot Lips
childhood we just came out with a new
matte collection of lipsticks called Hot
Lips and I grabbed to this tune I got
the shade at car mmm Karina's love I
thought was like carnivorous rose or
something up and then Miranda may some
random ate and Karina's love look at
this red look at this red oh you guys
know I love a blue toned red blue tone
Reds are my ish and then we have this
bad boy Miranda Mae this is like more
corally pink a warm coral pink and this
is a matte formula but it's definitely I
can already tell right now has a very
very subtle slight sheen to it so I know
it's any more of a comfortable matte
still looks matte on the lips but more
on the comfortable side so I'm excited
to try out more of the Charlotte Tilbury
Hot Lips okay I've been really wanting
this for so long this is the assist the
phyto lip start brilliance in white
diamond I don't know guys I've heard of
this class but it basically like a clear
glass with like intense Sparkle and like
shine to it it's literally so stunning
the first person I ever saw try this was
Jeffrey at his house he like purchased a
huge Cicely order and he had white
diamonds and it's as close right here
can you literally see there has so much
glitter in it gives a super gnarly
intense reflection but it's so beautiful
on the lift it looks like you're just
like I can't explain it's like a wet lip
look it's so beautiful and Jeffrey was
wearing it on his lips and I was like
what the do you have on your lips
Jeffrey and he said that
was least asleep idol star why Diamond
lipgloss and I was like so I so I need
they tell me that I need it great I'm so
excited to that I almost want to put on
top of my lipstick right now but I'm
wearing orange and I don't want anyone
if I was wearing a nude I'd be down but
Orange huh stocking cozy okay um I
grabbed a new pair of tweezers from
tweezer man I love tweezer man's brand I
think they're great this is also a
beauty leash
I said I'll lose all my tweezers and so
I just like wanted to get some more so I
got another pair of tweezers I'm in red
rojito
I got big color from sugarpill sugarpill
is a brand online basically it's more
like an e-commerce brand it's mostly on
like Instagram stuff like that so their
brand is super super fun it's very
bright very drag and I absolutely love
their brand and I grab the shade mo
cheeks I don't have this color it's like
a basically it's like a seafoam like
seafoam color take a seafoam green I've
been wanting a car like this for so long
to put like on the lid just be and look
up pigmented they are look help
sugar pill you are not playing a single
game and so I just really really really
really like their shadows I don't have
mochi so I wasn't really like to stack
that up last two products that I grabbed
from Beauty rich are the Natasha - Nonna
blush duo's they look like this so
basically just blush duos look up I went
to these in touch no new ones are
honestly I just really love the Natasha
Jinora powders I think they do so good
like those freakin palettes that are
expensive as hell you guys aren't
talking about with the $250 palettes
they're so good the powders are so nice
and the shadows are so nice so I figured
that their blushes would be just as bomb
and they freaking are hope tried them
yet but I'm sure I'm sure they are just
feeling them they feel great and that's
when at least I grabbed two lipsticks
from jeffree star mannequin and doll
parts I mean what else can I say about
Jeffrey star what can I say about that
brand I love dog barks I'm manic and
combining them is so beautiful and butyl
Akira's jeffree star products so that's
super super cool if you guys are ever
like frustrated that Jeffrey's out of
stock on something because he always is
his brand is just popping all the time
buta shiz one of the very very very very
few other places that you can buy
jeffree star cosmetics so check out
beadalicious site yeah that was it for
beauty licious haul I'm just I love them
be delish thank you guys for wide to
partner with me and work with me I just
I love your guys's products so much and
I love
just what a great company guys are so
keep up the good work I hope that people
want to go to your site we're gonna do
Sephora next let's open this mother
let's move in this mother yeah what the
 did I buy it don't remember yes yes
okay first things first
I grabbed another BB thickening dry spot
finish spray from bumble and bumble this
is my favorite thickening spray of all
time you guys know I don't like my hair
I think it's really really thin and I
just I don't like my hair it's just not
I'm not a fan of it I'm trying to do
other things to make it more thick and
like I've been going to I've actually
been seeing this one dude there's a
holistic doctor that's trying to like
help me he created this serum to help
with thin hair so I'm like trying to go
with him and see how that's going it's
been going pretty well though I like him
a lot
I'll let you guys know more about it if
it works other than that I love to use
this dry spun a finishing spray it's
literally eight I don't know what it is
like a powdered you guys eat rising
that's like a powder spray that you
spray at the root of your hair you judge
and then you just freaking survive and
your hair looks thicker little human
test so I'm sorry--but got another one
of these I ran out of the first one I
went to a bottle of it so clearly I must
love it bubble bubble sick man then
I grabbed so excited about these Kathir
these are the cover effects customer
enhancer drops these have been
everywhere these women all over the
freakin internet all over everyone's
talking about them saying that they love
them and how bright they are how intense
they are just how sick nasty they are so
I had to buy a couple of them I bought
these shades celestial I bought shades
moonlight those are the two I really
like I mean honestly like I'm not gonna
buy all four if I don't want to use all
four you feel me so I grabbed the shade
so let's just I'll do the double
celestial oh my god it's like liquid
metal and then drop a moonlight right
next to it look at how these these are
brutal and like the best way so we have
the lighter one is celestial then we
have moonlight on the side both are
absolutely stunning the calm reflected
they aren't like shocked at how intense
these are I'm definitely playing with
these and see how I like them
I've heard great things everyone talks
about that everyone says it how amazing
they are so I'm sure they're gonna be
freaking Bob then last night at least I
grabbed these Smashbox liquid lipstick
and the shade in demon
and online it look like the prettiest
color and I wanted to try this not the
most and I wanted to have the formula -
look at this look at this color in
demand it's funny cuz I bought this
online waiting for it to come in and I
just and literally like three days later
I got a PR package from Smashbox and
they sent me though the clip six and I
was like I buy a couple time it's like I
don't buy makeup all time I love getting
PR packages of course but advice so much
of my own makeup - is hilarious and B
we're always like why you buying more
nigga when you let me have everything
and I'm like because I still need some
work okay the Sephora was not I didn't
have a lot of stuff I just barely bought
a couple things so that's that and then
last but not least we have some stuff
from Kylie cosmetics
honestly like I had not bought anything
from her brand ever until right now this
is the first time I actually ever tried
to purchase something I tried it before
sold out of things that I wanted now
just like whatever I was super over I
don't wanna even try to get anything
else from her because I was just annoyed
so I finally made a purchase when she
came out with that black metal lipstick
and so I bought a couple of her things
like bring her home thankful I grabbed a
chimera steam I grabbed dead of night
and I got exposed I've literally been
sent Kylie cosmetics products from other
people that are not Kylie don't ask me
how I just have I have like Posie K
candy K like so random but I do have a
couple of their products and so I wanted
to buy a couple on my own and see how it
went through shipping wasn't terrible
actually it's funny cuz I actually got
sent two of the exact same package so I
bought one I checked my bank statement I
bought a set of it for like 90 bucks and
then I got sent two packages so I was
like oh so Leigh those are some mistake
they sent me to pack your some extent so
that'd be great to have an all-time one
to me so I gave it to my mom the other
package so let's talk about being nude
first because you guys know I love nudes
client ID M's bitch I got the shade
exposed oh my god is so much darker than
that wasn't me what okay so this is I
thought it was like a really light nude
oh my god this is straight-up like peach
almost orange
definitely not what I was expecting this
is these are the colors on the side
right here so the lip liner and we have
the lipstick smell not a fat not a fan
of I mean honestly I just think this
smell is like rotten vanilla then I
don't like it at all
but I do wear some of the lipsticks
already and honestly throughout your day
like you forget the scent so it's really
not that bad
I just think right away it's like
intense and strong but this color it is
beautiful I was just expecting it to be
a lot lighter and it knows to be so dark
my fault pool so that's that color I'll
gently try it out and see what how I
like it I wonder how it looks on the
lips I bet it looks a bit looks freaking
sick cuz I love those kind of colors
anyway sue let's go in with dead of
night like like the denim halo
night like Dark Knight rising so this is
denim light it's like a black liquid
lipstick black lip liner so we're gonna
swatch these guys too so we have the
black here swatches very nicely I think
Kylie cosmetics liners the lip liners
are so good I am obsessed with her lip
liners I think they did such a great job
like kudos to Kylie cosmetics for the
bomba plena to I truly think they're
amazing those are the kind of liners I
like the creamy pigmented easy to glide
on kind of pencils love them and then we
have dead of night which is their black
let's see how this looks
Oh Bingbing anything on being anything
um this actually is amazing
holy it super super black very very
very dark like really it is like dead of
night looks really really nice my second
try that I haven't wore black lipstick
in a minute so definitely using one of
these soon and then if you have a chi
and majesty and recently i this bad
boy has been in a lot of like
controversy because of the formula and
the bottle and just everything about it
basically people are saying that um so I
searched Anthes it just came up really
ugly burger eyes watch anyway this is it
right here
Kylie majesty I mean it's watching it's
streaky AF but it is swatching are these
metal lipsticks even supposed to be like
full Pig pigment like intense or are
they supposed to be like a light layer
wash and have a glittery effect what is
supposed to happen from this like is
this was a full penas or not because if
you're looking for a full pic swatch or
like a lipstick this is really not the
type for you I don't know it just kinda
streaky to me honestly it's not terrible
though I'm sure when I put on my lips it
won't be that bad I feels like the
entire bottle is filled up so I don't
feel like they're trying to get me or
there's not enough product to hear
anything
formulated this one is much thicker and
much more powdery than the other ones
it's more like play-doh II and I know
the reason for it just that's just how
it is when you're creating cosmetics
when you add my kit to something and you
have glitter and you had more of a dick
effect to a liquid lipstick and becomes
thicker because of the formula has more
powder in it so I understand it I
totally get it
I mean that's what I've heard that's
what I've heard and that's what I've
seen in the past but I may say to try it
out I'm I'm curious to see how it will
go on my lips so I'm excited to see how
this works
um but I got all three so hopefully
those work out pretty well and that is
it for today's entire video hope you
