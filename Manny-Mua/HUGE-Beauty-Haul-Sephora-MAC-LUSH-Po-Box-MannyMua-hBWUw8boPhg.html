Sephora and I've been meaning to film

comment you guys know I love comments
I'll stop rambling because I feel like
I've been rambling oh for four minutes
great okay so it's going to this started
we will start with the Sephora stuff
first first things first I bought the
Urban Decay Naked Skin Foundation this
is in the shade 3.5 the weightless ultra
definition liquid makeup in long sly
McManaman that was a real good like huh
I've heard a lot of great things about
this foundation I've heard bad things
and I've heard great things but you guys
know me I'm a foundation freak like a
hoard foundations even if I don't wear
them all the time
I love having foundations I wanted to
try this out really bad hopefully this
will match me
I love Urban Decay in general so I
really hope that really good please Lord
don't mean that soon next item is the
urban decay and it gets gonna weightless
concealer I use just concealer already I
use it literally all the time like I use
it all the times I just grabbed it back
up because I was running out of mine I
grab the shade light neutral it's a
color I use all the time
I love this concealer it's full coverage
it feels amazing it feel it goes on
super smoother that little paddle has
the cutest little paddle and it
goes on really good honestly like I
haven't grabbed a lot of concealers
since I've been using this one like this
one is like my go out of town concealer
like I do not part with this this bitch
doesn't leave my side next one I got the
Kate Somerville eradicate acne treatment
this is very similar to the Mario
Badescu boo disco which I don't know how
to say the same spot treatment it looks
like it took in a little like HR you
can't shake it
a very clear liquid on the top and has
like a pinky the sulphur treatment down
here we
do as you get a little q-tip dip it over
to the bottom spa treatment this bitch
up I love this I've used I've been using
this since I worked at Sephora it's just
great I give me like a spa treatment
like a packing treatment and I love Kate
Somerville's product they are so good I
love Kate Somerville it's ten percent
sulfur so it's very very very potent you
only need a small tiny BB amount on it
on your little pimples or whatever the
 you want to get rid of on your face
and it works really great okay next is
the melon daiquiri philosophy shower gel
I use this for shower gel I think it's
shower gel says shampoo shower gel and
bubble bath all in one it's the melon
daiquiri kind this is also another
repurchase I love the philosophy melon
daiquiri sent how literally use this to
wash my brushes as well because it
smells so good all like mix it in with
purity and get them together and she's
like mmm and it smells so amazing oh my
gosh it smells like a tropical oasis of
melons melon next on my little stuff on
this I grabbed the bite Beauty luminous
cream lipstick in the shade right Xena
that's the weirdest thing I've
ever heard read seen that what the
it looks like this it's a beautiful nude
choice watch I'm gonna swatch huh pinchy
away I knew I loved it this is what it
looks like it's a beautiful beautiful
pale nude pink it's so stuck look at
that bitch look at that bitch look at
him so beautiful that's why I grabbed it
next to grab this Stila stay all day
liquid lipstick in the shade below mom I
favor 't Stila liquid lipstick i swear
that's a for all time when i work there
if they beautiful bright nude like coral
oh my god let me just swatch the bitch
because it is perf why am I not wearing
this right now that's the real question
and it smells like cake better so it
looks like super bright and a dries
matte Stila stay all day liquid
lipsticks are also really really good
the next time my grad was the Clarisonic
delicate brush heads the refill ones I
always get the two evil ones because
it's obviously it's cheaper that way and
my mom has a Clarisonic as well so I'm
like I'm sure covering well my little
brush so this one is the delicate
replace head I like the delicate brush
head the most of all the brush heads
that Clarisonic does the delicate is the
best to me because I feel like it's the
most gentle like I mean obviously it is
delicate but it's gentle even if you
have like oily skin if you
really like rough skin or if you have
skin that doesn't break out very easily
out suggestive delicate I feel like the
delicate is the nicest filling on the
skin it doesn't like break the skin like
the other ones do like I tried normal
and I tried sensitive and they just they
felt a lot more rough on the skin so I
like grabbing delicate if you guys like
the Clarisonic try getting the delicate
head it's really really really nice in
my opinion in my humming next is the
Korres Greek yogurt sleeping mask facial
hmm I usually use this when I was just
four all the time but I forgot all about
it so it looks like his opening it's a
night cream it's a very intense
hydrating my cream it's very dense
and it feels so good on the skin it just
feel like yogurt on the skin it feels
very very heavy and viscous but once you
wake up in the morning after it if your
skin feels so hydrated so moist so happy
and very it just feels so like thank you
Manny
oh lipsticks I mean damn it it's
like Thank You Manny that was a really
great experience that we had last night
mm-hmm
I get that a lot and if you guys want to
try it go get a sample of it at Sephora
I got super lucky cuz I got this at
jcpenney Sephora and JCPenney Sephora's
don't carry Korres anymore so sometimes
like you'll get lucky and you'll be like
oh do you have any more of the Korres
any products left and that they do
they're usually on discount like on sale
this was 45 normally I got it's like 25
so I was really stoked about it the
Greek yogurt Korres that's all my
Sephora stuff let's move on
okay base room moving on to Mac I placed
in order on mac cosmetics online because
I was like you know what I need to buy
some new Mac stuff because I haven't
bought Mac and maybe since I've worked
at Mac that's been awhile since I 100k
subs so I went online and I just went
slightly am not a lot of ham slightly
him so I grabbed three of the new Mac
prep and prime setting sprays fix+ is
like very normal it's like a staple Mac
item fix+ it's absolutely amazing I love
fix+ but they just came out with scented
fix pluses and they have like different
colored bottles this one's the cucumber
one the wrong one
and the Latin turtle pond they also have
coconut but I forgot to get hoping I
don't know why I just didn't put in my
car I meant to buy for
only pop ribbon basically they're
amazing and I cannot wait to go back to
back to actually get more of them the
cucumber one is my favorite of the three
cucumber I love this smell cucumber so
much it just feels like so tropical and
swamp French and I literally just spray
the bitch like feels like I'm gonna
spawn and a spawn on to the I smell
amazing the lavender one is a little bit
strong for me like I would not have
bought it if I smelled it at the store
sadly but honesty doesn't matter I can't
wait to go back to get the coconut one
and I'll be repurchasing a cucumber and
repurchasing another rose because
they're limited edition that's so
annoying
 you macking a limited edition
I got another repurchase this is the
prep and prime highlighter and light
boost
I love the pepper and prime highlighters
there's so I love them for me like I
think they were absolutely beautiful
because there are a lot more thin than
normal concealers I like to mix them
with concealers it's not only brighten
but to dilute the concealer I always use
this with my Urban Decay Naked
weightless skin and it gives me not only
amazing full coverage but it's super
super brightening and I just I love that
look I love bright under eye out to the
temps out to the Tim's like I love
looking like a drag queen
with high ass cheek bones I think this
is absolutely beautiful I was running
out of my last one so I had a Reaper
Chong oh my god I'm really sad about
this so I ended up buying the pro
longwear nourishing foundation by Mac
it's the new one that they just launched
it's like the waterproof nourishing one
I grab and c20 cuz I heard that they run
darker I'm an NC 25 but I heard they run
darker side grab NC 20 because they
don't have 25 and they don't have like
35 they have only like 20 30 40 that is
annoying to me Mac you better
come out with more colors I've heard
really great things about this
foundation so I'm really hoping I'm
gonna like it so I grabbed two lipsticks
I grabbed one of the new ones the runway
hit retro matte lipsticks they just did
a new line of matte lipsticks and I
grabbed the color runway hit because
that was when I was speaking to you the
most it's a view - it's a peachy some a
peach so it looks like it's like a matte
peachy nude it's absolutely gorgeous
it's so pretty
Mac has such an awesome variety of color
I mean it's Mac like they have hundreds
of lipstick I think they're pretty and I
like MAC lipsticks and all the way these
now okay next one is shy girl this one's
not a limited edition color this is a
permanent color it is a cream machine I
think it's actually beautiful - another
nude color as you would see in nudes are
mine
I love buying news I love receiving news
it's a very very very like it's like a
what is this color man is this like a
yellow he knew it I think there's a lot
of yellow in this nude it's like a nude
peach yellow no no I don't get
this kind of color blue and my last
macro item is the studio chroma graphic
pencil in NC nw20 busy a nude pencil I
think this is a pro item I'm not sure
can use on your face to like spot tree
like a pimple or Samantha or you can use
it on your waterline to give you it like
a nice bright waterline this is what it
looks like
super brightening as you can see on if
you can even see it it looks really
really nice and looks promising I've
heard great things about the chroma
graphic pencil line from Mac so let me
know if you guys have any of the chroma
graphics because this is the first one
I've ever bought please be good to me
pickle it's going to start with some
lush items because I got a bunch of lush
I got a bunch of wash
first things first they grab the
celestial facial moisturizer celestial
is they crafted with sins of skin in
mind with gentlemen cocoa butter vanilla
water celestial is like a deep hydrating
moisturizer that's more on the heavy
side more like a sleeping moisturizer
I'm not really sure I could be wrong
I met the lush people at generation
beauty and so they like work with me now
or like they send me PR so thank you so
much to lush like the lush team for
being so freaking amazing I wanna see
like I haven't ever tried a lot of lush
stuff but I've been wanting to so badly
and now that I know them like what the
 you guys have any suggestions from
lush that you like and want me to try it
let me know in the comments because I
really it really curious about lush
stuff looks like that who like yogurt
that smells like yogurt like
literally yo girl I got the vanishing
cream facial moisturizer this was a very
light moisturizer basic like a day
moisturizer
it's called banishing clean for reason I
bet it'll be really great for people
that are oily I'll let you guys know
about this one because it looks very
promising because I don't know it looks
like I'm going to slit have a couple
bath bombs will they sent me a couple
bath bombs
I got Twilight Dragon's egg and
spacegirl Dragon's egg is the one that
smells the most like amazeballs to me oh
I'm trying to bath bomb one time in my
whole life and it was from lush another
friend gave it to me and I tried it was
like a rose one and those like roses in
the bathtub after like I was
done it was the coolest thing I was like
this is really cool but it kind of
clogged my dream it was amazing it
smelled amazing and it felt so good on
the skin like it made my skin feel so
much better and then I got two samples
of the shower gels I got dirty spring
wash and I got
flying fox I've already opened this one
and I used it and I've smelled it and it
is everything dirty spring wash Oh what
do you even smell like it's too good
let me just read off it because
I can oh my god my spell this no don't
be dirty get fresh with this tingly and
extremely minty shower gel it's like a
dip in the mountain spring with
spearmint and menthol to make your skin
feel cool in the shower in the hot
shower
yep everything you just said is true
it's one of my favorite shower gels I've
ever tried from any brand ever it is so
amazing smelling like go to this lush
store and smell the dirty spring wash I
know it sounds weird - the dirty Spain
watch it's charity but it's not it
smells seriously amazing the flying fox
I did smell not sure if I'm really too
keen on this bitch oh I don't know about
that I don't know all that hard and I
don't know what hold on oh honey
jasmine honey jasmine so it's like a
honey jasmine just cuz I'm smelling it
like this I got to try it in the shower
wall I don't know what's gonna be on my
skin but right now it smells kind of
like I don't know kinda weights me up
the smell kind of wait to get a little
bit I'll try you out bitch but I don't
know if I'm gonna love you as much as
dirty spring next I just wanna grab a
couple items from my p.o box close just
a couple like mentions cuz I think
they're really badass the amazing nude
sticks like basically everyone talks
about nude sticks on YouTube and on
Instagram new sticks it's like a little
brand that has like little sticks that
are like no mean like little stick
pencils that are like really easy to use
or like more beginner each style like
just like the average girl toss them in
the purse use it all the day and you're
good contouring highlighting sticks they
have lip pencil sticks they have a bunch
and they the nude six people hit me up
and they're like yeah we wanna sign you
some new sticks and soul Danielle if the
mob hit that p.o box thank you so much
Jillian six are sending me this awesome
PR package I'm really excited to try
them out I've heard great things for
sure like I've heard really great things
about new sticks also from my Peele box
I got a huge package from LC the
foundation LC which was created by
makeup by Lillian on Instagram who was a
really popular makeup artist on
Instagram Jacqueline was the one that
actually told me about this foundation
she said she loved it that super super
national it goes on really beautifully
I'm actually wearing this foundation
right here I'm wearing two pumps of it
okay let's be honest I'm wearing three
pumps of it it is a very beautiful
natural foundation I don't really know
what kind of skin type this for per se
but it did make me a little bit oily
not a little bit I was pretty early two
of the day even though I was wearing
some edifying primers but it looks
absolutely beautiful and I think it
looks really nice like this is such a
great natural foundation to me and thank
you to make a pilot for sending it to me
yeah okay so also my last thing from the
peel box that I got that I'm gonna
actually show you guys is from
colour-pop it's the new colour-pop
liquid lipsticks the liquid to matte
lipsticks that are $6.00 each um mmm I
honestly don't know how I feel about
these yet I don't have a super set
opinion yet basically I've tried four of
the colors so far every color that I've
tried has done the same thing to me what
happens is I put the first layer on and
you think like oh this is pretty good
like this is pretty good layer dries so
fast it dries in like 10 seconds like
two fouls
too fast completely dries down type a
second layer on because the first layer
usually is an opaque as you want it to
be that's all I am I like to do two
layers my liquid lipsticks but second
layer on the first layer comes off when
you're putting the second one on did I
do this you can't do that like at all
like when it's like in the middle of
drying and it literally like will come
off on the wand it is so weird I don't
know how I feel about these yet honestly
like color pop is so badass they
have such an awesome brand and there's
such a cost-efficient brand but even if
these are six dollars like I want them
to work I want them to be good you know
and the four that I tried were not good
and I would not use them personally
anymore
so I'm really hoping that I can try a
couple more like later on and I'll like
them the reason I even wanted to include
this in it because for those of you are
planning on buying the colour-pop liquid
lipsticks let me know what you think
about them because I'm so curious like
I'm sorry my friend Nicole Young Walden
polish Nicole and we were both having
the same problems with the liquid
lipsticks so I'm really hoping that it's
more of a I'm just applying it wrong or
I'm just something's going on with the
liquid lipsticks that I'm just not I'm
doing it wrong because I want to love
these so bad but right now I don't might
really want to because there's so many
awesome colors and they just weren't
working they became so crusty on my lips
like literally I could you not like
after the second layer when I was trying
to figure it out and I was like doing
that cross like beyond crusty and I
would like this and rub my lid
Kris was falling off my face and onto my
 dresser literally crust
pieces of lipstick on my dresser and I
was oh what oh oh so I'm hoping that
it's just me but I'm playing it wrong so
please if you guys do plan on buying
them let me know how you like them
because I
don't ya they all do another for a
different chance like later on you know
but right now I can't like I just I
don't want to use them you know because
I'm scar from Scott I got another thing
for my peel box but I can't show you
guys yet because it's more of a surprise
I just really want like this year to be
like to keep going because it's just
like there's some things that are

really want you guys to know already
