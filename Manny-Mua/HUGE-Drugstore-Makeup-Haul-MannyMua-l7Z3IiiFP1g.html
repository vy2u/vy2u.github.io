Beauty hole
literally not seeing someone do a haul

I remember when halls were such a huge
thing on YouTube and I feel like I never
see anyone do halls anymore and I'm like
worried at all like I wanted I love
seeing halls so I'm gonna go ahead and
film it this Hall really quickly I hope
you guys like it I'd let me have a few
Jess come on get with it bitch
and so I'm just gonna jump right in that
was way too close to my face don't ever
do that again first things I grabbed on
my bag are these lashes by Vegas nay and
I'll or I have been seeing these lashes
everywhere everywhere all over everyone
and I never tried them literally never
English in the style grande glam wreck
everyone talks about them these look so
freaking dramatic like three layers they
look like really really intense lashes
and it just looks like so quiet let me
found these at the drugstore how amazing
is it that biggest thing is inside the
drugstore so excited you try these out
I'm I need I need to use them the next
thing I picked up is the elf blush
palette I hear amazing things about this
I literally just watch one of
Jacqueline's videos favorite drugstore
products video and she had this blush
palette in it and I was like you know
what you know what if she has that in
that video it's a freakin favorite
drugstore video that I need to pick it
up so I picked up these blushes from ELF
I think it was like literally like six
bucks
I've already swatch them and they're
pigmented they're beautiful like I'm I'm
so obsessed I cannot wait to try it this
bitch
oh so keep it on with the elf I grabbed
three of their brushes I grabbed it
they're new I don't this is like new it
just says new one the little packaging I
don't know what the new I grabbed their
elf Beauty beautifully bear that sounds
dangerous
don't ever do it bear beautifully bear
blending brush it's like a little like
tapered brick let's open it I don't even
I don't know I didn't mean it's not open
yet may see it looks like it just
basically the contour brush the bristles
I feel amazing this looks very promising
I love like really picks up their game
sometimes honestly like I'll get really
impressed with off and I'll be like okay
I see you three dollars in the right
place so then I also grab it the
ultimate
blending brush which is like a buffing
brush basically this reminds me of the
Sephora brand
I can't open it this is what it looks
like it's nice just a little buffing
blending brush it looks like this this
also looks very very very promising this
reminds me so much of the Sephora brush
holy crap it even feels like the Sephora
brush elf how did you do this for six
and Sephora's a 25 I don't know and then
I also just grabbed it this little
angled liner brush I just saw the tip of
it the tip look really really really
tiny and I want to try that for winged
liner I love to do a very sharp winged
liner and if I can get away with a brush
that's really small and defined I'll
grab it and I'll use it so next brand I
grabbed a couple items from is
Physicians Formula and I grabbed hmm the
butter bronzer everyone everyone told me
to buy the butter bronzer because I was
looking for good bronzer from the
drugstore on my drugstore video and I
had so many people tell me to buy this
bronzer and I was like you know what
okay so I went out and bought it and I'm
gonna open it for the first day right
now it's so pretty either might see like
the Bahamas or something
either that smells good too what this
was amazing it reminds me of like body
oils I can't explain it just smells like
literally like the Caribbean I just want
like two coconuts in the ocean
it really does how about let's call it
off because it's it's very very very
smooth and amazing feeling and it smells
amazing oh if it's too but if it's too
light I'll talk about it the next two
things I got from Physicians Formula are
both shimmer strips
I heard amazing things about physician
formula shimmer strips this one I saw
kathleenlights using in one of her
videos so this is what it looks like
it's literally like a shimmer brick I
heard it similar to like the Bobbi Brown
shimmer brick so if I can spend like 12
bucks on something rather than six the
mom is going to so it's going to swatch
some huh
no it literally like look at it I'm
sorry Physicians Formula when do we come
in play very excited to try out this
Vegas strip light bronzer that's not a
bronzer don't lie to me okay and then I
also just grabbed this one because I
didn't know which of the physician
strips I really wanted so I grabbed this
one as well this is the warm nude
shimmer strip brick it looks like this
these just have little like bows on it I
didn't know which is the one that would
be better so I grabbed both I'm just in
case mm feels very buttery very nice
it's also very very pigmented right here
again super excited to try this out
looks absolutely stunning how physicians
momisa know about yeah okay so I grabbed
two things from Milani I grabbed the
Milani conceal perfect foundation to one
foundation I had so many people telling
me about this foundation as well to try
it how that it covers nicely it's great
for oily skin it's good for a lot of
skin types zero to natural that's my
color I'm hoping it's my color just
snagged X it just looked like the most
like me in the bottle here's hoping and
then I also grabbed the Milani
bellissimo bronze baked powder blush I
love like those like apricot II type of
blush colors and so I saw this and I was
like this looks like something I would
really be interested in so let's open it
and swatch it
I'm excited so this is what it looks
like it's just a beautiful like apricot
bronze color and you guys know me like
wild honey by Becca it's like my
favorite blush of all time and that is
like an apricot perfection apricot
perfection what did I literally just say

color zero six dying to use that I
grabbed this L'Oreal infallible Pro
matte powder I have the L'Oreal
infallible liquid which I ran out of I

liquid and I absolutely love that
foundation so much I think it's
absolutely amazing why am i staring at
