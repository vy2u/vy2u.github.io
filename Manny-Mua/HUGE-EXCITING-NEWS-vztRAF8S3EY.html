I'm hiding my sweaty there's me guys I
can't like I can't even start to talk
about this I'm freaking out
breathe bitch free it out of your mouth
in through your nose out of your mouth
hey guys welcome back to my channel Oh
so today's video is going to be
basically the most meaningful video I've
ever had it's gonna be I'm just so
excited this is just the most excited
I've ever been to film a video I'm sorry
for can't even speak it just I'm just so
excited so a lot of you guys have been
guessing and catching on to my hints
that I've been dropping for the past
couple months on snapchat Instagram
Twitter onto the fact that I am in
collaboration with a brand a lot of you
guys have guessed it and you guys are
right I am clapping with some brands and
I'm finally able to talk about one of
the collaborations that I'm doing oh my
god it's the first one I'm allowed to
talk about in the first one but that
it's coming out and I'm so excited I'm
so excited I just just do it this
 banner just bring the bitch up
oh my god no again it is dry cosmetic I
did a liquid to matte lipstick with them
it is called serenity it's the lipstick
I'm wearing right now it is a beautiful
warm pink with brown undertones in it
it's very nice it's kind of nude but
still gives you some color it's perfect
it's perfect I absolutely am obsessed
with this color this lipstick we have
been working on this lipstick for seven
months it's been a secret for seven
months I just I can't even like I didn't
want to tell you guys so badly I've been
wearing this on my Instagram religiously
like so many photos that I've been
posting on Instagram and you guys are
like well if stickers that well if sick
is that what lipstick is that finally
I'm allowed to say that it has been
serenity this whole entire time it's
finally out today oh my oh I will show
you guys what the packaging looks like
it's a frosted bottle with a gold cap
you know I'm not really sure how much is
in here I'll have to leave that link
down below or I'll put it across the
screen it's amazing and I absolutely
love the packaging it's very sleek as a
frosted bottle it's a gold little cap it
looks like this it's a doe foot
applicator like this it looks like that
oh my god okay stop okay a manual
session
so I named this color serenity because
it's kind of a darker Riesling don't
 up me I need this remedy because of
the Japanese enemy Sailor Moon serenity
was the princess of the Moon and I know
it sounds kind of lame like Manny really
you named it after Japanese enemy
character but the show say the moon was
a huge influence for me when I was
younger and I always felt like I really
connected with that show because during
the day the main character Usagi she was
a dorky child who just was always out of
place she never felt like she belonged
and that really just resonated within me
when I was younger because that's how I
felt
you know what I mean and I might she
would turn into his badass
crime-fighting vixen and not saying that
I'm a crime-fighting mixon at all but I
feel like now as an adult I'm so much
more confident in Who I am as a person I
just felt like that was such a fitting
name for me serenity was just what I
wanted it to be and makeup makeup brings
me to a serene place you know makeup is
my go-to it's what I feel happy doing
doing makeup makes me feel happy and it
takes me to a place of serenity and so I
really wanted to name it after something
like that and that's why I named it
serenity Garrard cosmetic is actually
doing a whole new line on hydro master
called hydro mats because they are not
drying on the lips they are a liquid
lipstick that dry to a matte finish but
they're not super and mattifying as you
can see on my lips but you can't see
like the crack that really intense
cracks in my lips you know what I mean
like others like the color pop ones or
the line cream ones
there's only three of them launching in
the beginning so these are the three
I'll talk about these two it more
towards the end of the video but they
aren't doing a whole new line called
hydro matte liquid lipsticks it was
really important to me in the owner of
jar cosmetics to make liquid lipsticks
that do not dry out the lips and you
can't really feel them on the lips but
the pigment is so there you know what I
mean and that's what these are these are
absolutely amazing truly amazing we
would do like four different formulas
and this is like the sixth color that I
approved this is seven months and I'm
making you know what I mean this is
seven months in the making and I wanted
it to be perfect and so did your
cosmetics the wear time is like four to
five hours because it is more hydrating
of a liquid lipstick it's not gonna be
like shellac on the lips and if I can
stay for like 12 hours like other ones
do but it has great wear four to five
hours and I just feel like this
collaboration is such a fitting match
all of you guys don't know this about
what Jorah cosmetics was the first
friend to ever see me as someone who
could do beauty and see me as a boy
doing beauty and still
like working it you know what I mean a
lot of brands did not believe in me like
when I would email the brands for PR and
things like that they would they would
reply like oh no you're look isn't
whatever going for and it would hurt it
hurt you know especially me like I'm
trying to like fulfill my dreams here
and other brands were not understanding
that I was a boy doing it and Gerard was
the first brand to ever really start
working with me at 20,000 on Instagram
so before I even started YouTube George
cosmetics and I started working together
and so it's just like it's the first
brand ever really truly love me they
thought I was a great person and they
truly believed in me and honestly I just
want to thank you guys you guys are the
ones that made this happen you know what
I mean um when I was little never in my
wildest dreams did I think that I could
do this I was 9 or 10 and I was praying
and I would say please let me change let
me be not gay I wanted to be normal you
know what I mean um I wanted to be
someone who people would be proud of I
wanted to be someone that my mom and dad
would be proud of and knowing that
they're proud of me now with doing what
I'm doing wearing makeup like I couldn't
I couldn't do this without you guys you
know I'm sorry for crying like it's so
dumb but it just goes to show how much
the world is changing and this isn't
just for me this lipstick is going out
to all the little boys and all the girls
out there who think that they need to
change you do not need to change you'd
be the same person you are and
you stay that way and you will succeed
in life I promise you do not change for
anyone or anything and I'm sorry for
getting emotional like that at a moment
sorry I would have never thought that
this had happened to me especially when
I was little I would cry myself to sleep
wishing that I would change and wishing
that was straight if I was straight
would I be doing this I don't think so
would I be able to collaborate with a
brand who believed didn't mean no I
wouldn't and would I be able to have
almost half a million subscribers no I
don't thank you so much to everyone even
