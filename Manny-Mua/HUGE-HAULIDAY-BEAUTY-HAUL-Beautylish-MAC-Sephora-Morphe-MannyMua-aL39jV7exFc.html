movie was in to come on like
Halloweentown status or like something

further ado let's going to get into this
haul video okay cool first things first
let's go and start with Beauty lish cuz
that's like the most I have so beauty
list Beauty Lycians a online it
basically can online Sephora type
situation but I feel like Vidya she's
like where you go to fight harder to
find makeup like they have Inglot they
have Bioderma they have Kevin a Quan
they have like those kind of makeup
brands there so I got a bunch of
okay I think this is what I'm the most
excited for is the visor or busy art
whatever it's called the palette I have
one of the visor palettes it is
beautiful but I saw this one and I
almost threw up because it's so
beautiful die worthy look at this
palette you guys honestly look at these
colors this is me this is me Estes y'all
okay let's just watch a couple Oh
like honestly creamy buttery pigment
advised art but it's really expensive
it's like literally eighty dollars
heavily OH
so this is the dark matte palette that's
what this one is called it's beautiful
I'm obsessed butyl ish heaven coming to
use it let me know if you guys wanna see
tutorial with our ad to refill my
Bioderma h2o makeup remover this is like
the best I can remove I literally ever
use it is so freaking bomb I'm obsessed
with this makeup remover I also like to
use it as a toning water I use this like
after I wash my face I'll use this on my
face to kind of like get off the excess
gunk because it isn't makeup remover
water and it really does get off like
all the extra that I have it
clogged and they're like pressed in mama
gets pressed sometimes the foundation
gets stuck in my pores and this helps
really take it out and so I love the
Bioderma h2o sensible since a bio h2o
what the phone I don't know what's
called then I got six Jeffrey's are
liquid lipsticks dye these are the
holiday ones actually I think it's so
freakin bad that's not Bueller sells
jeffree star liquid lipsticks so if you
guys are ever like interested in getting
Jeffrey Stehr liquid lipsticks but you
can't find any other site or anything
check out beuliss because they will have
some on there but I got druglord the
white one and drogyny that like a ma B
purpley tone obsessed with that one pogo
ho I think that's the green one
mistletoe Nelly ho ho is the wrong one
obviously if you're being a ho you're
probably wearing red okay mistletoe is
the green one and then I got dog part
just like a really soft pink obsessed
and then I knew I never had a nude
before when Jeffery star sent out to me
once but I never got I'm nude with it so
I was like oh what doc :
I love the Geoffrey start liquid
lipsticks I think they're so good this
is what I really want can't want it so
whole so this is the cabinet want
sensual skin enhancer this is basically
you just show you what it looks like
it's a little tubby looks like that this
is a concealer I mean this
concealer can cover a truck I
don't know if guys have ever heard the
Kevin of kwanzaa sensual skin enhancer
but literally this this amount I have on
my finger
tiny I'm not kidding me when I say like
the is so ultra pigmented and so
dense and so clean eat like I knew I
wanted this a little bit goes a very
very long way you need to set that bitch
because it will crease on your ass
miss talk about this really really
quickly so I got the new Wayne Goss
brush this is the like bronzing Holliday
brush it is a flimsy delicious and so
flimsy this is like one of the softer
pressures I've got reduced
honestly I've already talked about the
wind gust brushes they are so
high-quality so so so soft they are bit
pricy to be quite honest they're pricey
not gonna lie they're pricey I don't
know why because I think the high
quality you know
yeah I'm trying to get because honestly
it's it's just so beautiful that I'm
like yeah one of the pattern on this do
I really want to use it like do I really
but it just it's absolutely stunning and
I'm obsessed love linkus brushes my
loved one goes let's be honest next two
items are from ardency in you do this
also carries hard to see in they carry
all the cool like cool brands you know I
don't know so I got the monster liquid
liner and the supercharged smooth rider
eyeliner does what they look like
Jacqueline is like I love with the
ardency imp eyeliner and she told me
she's like it's seriously so black it's
so long-lasting on the waterline and I
was like you know wow okay and then this
is the liquid oh yeah it's a little
liquid so that's what not only some
cutie litters I have the it cosmetics
celebration foundation I honestly only
got this because my mom was like
literally raving about it she was like I
need to try this foundation from it I
really love doing it and I was like fine
mom we get you once I got her one I got
me one the reason she liked it so much
because it reminded her of Studio Fix
foundation by Mac but like probably
better ingredients like no tea no shade
Mac but better ingredients it's a full
coverage powder foundation I'm really
excited to try this celebration
foundation out also really random like
side note with beuliss you can do like a
payment plan with Beauty lish had no
idea they did that first of all that's
super sick literally if you wanted buy
something you can do like a payment plan
with Beauty lay so I thought that was
really really cool a lot of other like
beauty brands or Beauty like stores
don't offer that kind of thing so if you
guys there's in that check that out okay
cool so we are done with Beauty leche be
delicious be really quick let me just
bring this up because I just wanna talk
about a really cool thing I just got in
the mail literally today and I was dying
this is the new morphe tub it's like a
big huge brush tub um obsessed a cupcake
this is like this is the perfect
tub for traveling I'm so excited to use
this and then I already have some
brushes in it and and morphe just
launched new elite collection brushes
these all easily brushes are here are
brand new to more fees line so I'm so
excited to try them out like you guys
know morphe fanatic and they just watch
more elite brushes like the lis
collections already my favorite like
what did you just do it anymore
you just me up in the best
way let me just point out a couple that
I could already tell I'm gonna be
obsessed he 41 it's like the G 0 but
eight-week collection bristles o 44 is a
hybrid tree and a flat top kabuki and a
normal kabuki has like a flat surface
but it's kind of rounded so it's kind of
weird
it's like one of those like it's like a
hybrid oh my god it's like a hybrid that
reminds me of the original you
know cuz class is a hybrid but it's
actually really really nice it looks
like it's really nice to buff and it's
not as dense as other brushes are which
is why I feel like like this is only
great for powder oh yes
the e53 I'm gonna be obsessed it's
basically like an e3 but a flat pinched
ferrule version I mean can you guys see
how it's like this from the side looks
like III pinched ferrule gonna be great
for contouring and great for blushing we
agree for highlighter this is gonna be a
sick ass brush I just talked about those
three just for now this is just like a
random I just want to show you guys
really quickly and as you guys know you
guys can use my code man you a in all
caps to save 10% off more fee online or
in store don't forget you guys go and
store and berming that store so
cool I swear to god I think we just
talked about the morphe tub it's
dirty bitch right here let's move on to
Sephora first things from Sephora I
wanted to snaggle is the the Too Faced
chocolate bon bons palette it looks like
it looked seriously just so cute and
I've heard so many really positive
things about this palette that was like
let me try this a little bit up in
myself it is so cute the packaging
obsessed as I got a rib riveted is that
a word bridged no ribbed as a rib his
ribs the right term for like embossed I
think it's a cost
it has lifted little hearts okay so what
the little palette looks like magically
was just so cute I think this is
seriously so adorable it's so two-faced
it's a I'm obsessed I think Kathleen was
the one that was like really waiting
about this one and I was like mm-hmm
okay so I'm really excited to try out
the bon bons palette by Too Faced I got
another highlighter don't judge me don't
judge me I don't have enough but I saw
this one in like almost had a heart
attack this is by Bobby Brown this is a
highlighting powder in the shade pink
glow you guys ah this little bitch
wasn't cheap though not gonna lie is
what it looks like let me just swatch
real quick it's like an icy baby pink
color okay this is actually really
really rare for me to even want to try a
baby pink I see highlighter I really
only into gold highlighters I don't even
like colors like this but this one from
Bobby Brown was literally jumping out of
me and I was like I need you I really do
so then I ended up just buying it and I
was like you don't it I haven't
even tried it yet
I spend on my face right now
oh my god okay you guys convinced me who
does that make a difference
oh I don't know why I'm not going to
make a person that's into pinkie
highlighters or the silvery ones I'm
only into gold that's like all I'm into
hopefully this will help me branch out
into the world of pinky highlighter next
I went a little bougie ham and when I
was a little bluesy bitch not gonna lie
and I bought the YSL baby doll mascara I
used to be obsessed with the Wisel baby
doll mascara I remember gaining it once
I was like a sample I think I was like a
perk when I were Jensen for I was like a
perk as 100-point prick and you got like
a mini sample of the why some baby doll
and i was like obsessed with have a bomb
it was so I ended up buying another one
haven't used it since I've worked at
Sephora which is two years ago so if you
guys ever want a nice high-end mascara
that's gonna cost you an arm and a
 leg but you know it's gonna be
good for your lashes why is that we bit
off so last two items from sephora i
want to quickly mention are from Kat Von
D they are two liquid lipsticks I got
Lolita 2 which is the second version of
Lolita which is one of the most popular
the clips it's by Kat Von D ever it is
such a beautiful shade it's just amazing
I love that shade so I ended up getting
number two and then I also grabbed a bow
and arrow which is really really really
popular as well her just watching on my
arm
let me just watch them for you guys okay
I'm gonna close like this I don't want
to describe I can't describe I
really can't
this is like a warm terracotta color
with some pink to it that is that good
enough
is that what you want for me this is
like a really cool tone like sepia type
color I don't know if I'm gonna like
this okay so bow and arrow is definitely
more of a nude sepia type of color at
the brownness to it and a little Leda to
is a very just very warm terracotta pink
shade only the two also has a lot of
orange to it as well so this is what
they look like Lolita to and bow and
arrow I'm a statue I so um I know a leta
- I'm gonna pull that bitch off like
mm-hmm
good I love clothes like this but bow
and arrow I don't know about you bitch I
don't know about you and last but not
least from Mac I just wanna do a quick
little Mac haul and go ham and Mac
whatsoever I just got a couple items I
want to show you guys really quickly
because I love them I've been hearing a
lot about shade stir which is a
sculpting powder by Mac but it's
basically a contouring shade a lot
people have been talking about this
recently Patrick you still like love
this when he worked on Mac huge easy for
his nose Jack didn't love shade stir as
well and I was like you
they like it so much I'm gonna try it
out so chic is like I can work with
stuff that works on Jacqueline skintone
you know saying I think if it works for
her I think it'll work for me
so shade stir try it out I was at a pro
store when I bought these oh my god I
only got pro items I only got a couple
but whatever so that shade stir and then
I got to reflect glitters Mac reflect
glitters are some of my favorite
glitters in all the makeup game the
beauty game total I'm obsessed with Mac
reflex glitters I end up grabbing
reflect bronze and reflex pearl reflex
pearl is a basically a whitish champagne
reflection the reflex bronze is like a
bronzy gold reflecting glitter I love
them I'm basically just trying to
collect all of the reflect glitters I
like I have like six right now I have
blue gold teal these two five five I
really want to use like the reflex runs
