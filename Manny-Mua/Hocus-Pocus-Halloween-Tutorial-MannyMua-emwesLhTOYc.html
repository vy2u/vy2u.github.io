don't push me don't push nobody will
shut up
we are descendants
hey guys
Sara here from the Sanderson sisters
clan so with a mic like channel so today
we decided to film a awesome collab with
Winnie and Mary Sanderson sister so yeah
if you always want to see um their looks
head over to Patrick and Chris news
channel we decide to do this super
awesome Club and I hope you guys enjoy
it and if you don't like it I'll put a
spell on ya bye guys happy Halloween
mwah hey guys so I'm gonna go into a
voiceover for the first time like a
verse is so hard so what I'm doing is
grabbing a orange corrector this is from
Mac and a little fluffy morphe brush
just cuz I have an a beard and I need to
cover that bad boy up you know I'm
saying
and then we're grabbing the Marc Jacobs
remarkable foundation it is full
coverage it is so so so amazing I'm just
taking it out of the bottle and putting
on with my fingers all over my face to
cover up that orange and taking a Real
Techniques Beauty Blender I'm gonna
blend that bad boy all over the face
this is like my favorite way of applying
this kind of foundation because it is so
full coverage I like to dilute it with a
Beauty Blender and it works out so
nicely I love it - this way
I really do you and get my ears -
because I always forget and then you
cannot forget of course the little extra
roles that you have on your neck you
need to cover those spots - they might
be a little orange okay I'm having my
Urban Decay Naked weightless concealer
in the lightest shade that they have I'm
gonna go and highlight and conceal I'm
going to make my face look a little bit
longer than usual even though my face is
already long like Sarah Jessica Parker's
we have that similar to face shape I'm
just gonna highlight because I am doing
drag so I'm gonna go real heavy with
that highlight under eyes forehead and
then singing a slight amount it's kind
of cold you doing voice-overs cuz you
get to sing how like you get to see and
listen to music so it's kind of cool
but I'm just gonna put that with a
Beautyblender and then I'm just
appreciating the fact that I am so full
coverage it's insane and then I'm taking
a morphine m-43 8 and the laura mercier
translucent setting powder I love this
powder it is such a silky finely milled
powder it is amazing and I'm just kind
of setting all my concealer areas
whether it's under my eyes forehead
everywhere and then I'm gonna go ahead
and grab the laura mercier translucent
setting powder for the whole face and a
huge powder puff I'm gonna go very very
heavy handedly with this powder it is
very finely milled and I'm gonna go and
set my whole entire face because I have
a lot of creams on and then thinking me
more Fiji's ear opening it down my neck
the same powder I just it's easier to
use than putting a powder puff down my
neck
and then I'm gonna go in to highlight
I'm gonna kind of cook my under eye
gonna make it look a lot more bright
underneath the eye and let it sit for a
couple minutes I'm actually pulling it
into my nose a little bit as well to
make my nose look a little bit smaller
on the sides kind of those drag-queen
tricks so you're gonna do under the eyes
chin nose forehead head where they
wanted to be a little more highlighted I
kind of did my jawline too but I totally
to me need to do that because I do it
later on so you can forget that stubble
you want and then drink your water
because we need to stay hydrated we need
to stay hydrated my darlings so I kind
of jump around whenever I'm doing and
get ready with me um so I'm gonna go
ahead and start carving out my brow bone
with some concealer this is a Beca
concealer and a little more feet
concealer brush everything will be
linked down below brushes and things
like that because I I don't remember the
names of them right now so then I'm
gonna go ahead and do my brows I'm gonna
do real fleek with my brows today I'm
gonna grab the are Nastasia dip brow and
a little Anastacio brush and start
carving out the v brow I can start from
the bottom of my brow and make a nice
clean line and then I'm gonna make a new
arch for myself to give me a nice sharp
arch sara has a really nice defined brow
in the movie it's very very dark so what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go ahead and
brush through this gel through my brows
to make it look real intense because I
have a lot of powder on my brows so then
I'm gonna go ahead and kind of dust away
all the powder I have on my face just go
through the sitting for about 20 minutes
and
so just give me a nice more brighten oh
wait look and you can tell that's more
bright now I'm going to grab the
Smashbox 24-hour primer put on my lid
you know Dale prime and set it with the
offenders and powder because it is tacky
and then I'm going in with this amazing
Kat Von D might be look about I didn't
want to use this so badly and so I just
kind of mixed the orange and more in
beige-ish shade to start going with my
e27 by morphe and I'm going to start to
create my crease I'm going with this
color cuz sarah has a nice warm crease
going on and then I'm gonna kind of
highlight the brow bone with this flat
brush
and so now I'm gonna go ahead and mix it
this nice chocolate shade with the nice
burgundy shade with a more feet m4 33
and that's gonna go all over my lid up
to my crease as well as in the inner
corner because she does again have a
really dark inner corner and you want to
keep it that dark in that intense and
that just smoked out effect you know
what I mean she's very very sexy and she
takes care of herself unlike her other
sisters so she's gonna look real real
good and they're just kinda blending
away with you 27 from morphe again just
to kind of have no harsh edges because
she has no edges mama she's good and now
I'm taking Urban Decay perversion
eyeliner and that's gonna run all over
my lash line because her eye is a lot
more smoky but it is very very just like
smoky by the lash line not all over the
lid
and then I'm gonna go ahead take a
little smudgy brush from morphe and
start blending out that intense black
liner to make it more like smudgy and
blended and to give me more of a nice
just like blended outlook and then I'm
gonna go in tight line I hate time
lining it's such an annoying process but
it's totally worth it and then I'm
taking the kat von d palette all over
again
that black shade and taking a really
stiff little makeup geek brush and I'm
gonna start running that over and over
the black liner to not only set it but
to give me more of a blend to kind of
give me that nice transition shade into
the next colors and me appreciating the
fact that it's blending out pretty
nicely I love the Kat Von D shadows they
are amazing and I'm taking the block
again fitting into the inner corner
Sarah again has that really dark in the
corner going on so we want to make that
as dark as possible but without being
too like a raccoon is you know I'm
saying so we're gonna take that black
and blend it out really nicely into that
burgundy and brown shade go get going on
just from the inner corner yeah y'all
sound sound sound else I'm just gonna
blend away guys it's all about blending
Sarah takes care of herself she blends
so we're gonna do is we'll take
perversion all over again
and run that in the waterline as well as
kind of on the outer corner I hate doing
this step it annoys me so much and then
smudging it out again with that little
smudgy brush it just gonna be so much
more convenient to blend out shadows
into it later if you can just smudge it
out now and then just kind of use
shadows later on and now I'm taking this
black and this like topi grayish shade
mix them together and start blending out
that perversion liner from Urban Decay
Sara's eyes are really really really
smoky on the underneath of her eye as
well as the inner corner so I'm really
gonna really smoke that out and drag it
out intensely it's not going to be a
very subtle smoky it to be really smoky
on the bottom lashline as well as kind
of rounding out the outer corner we want
to make sure everything is really really
dark around the lashes as well as the
inner corner and outer corner of course
we can't let it be like looking like she
hit mama we need to look good so then
I'm gonna go and take the morphe g-zero
and mac mineralize skinfinish I do jump
around a lot in this video I apologize
but I'm going to take the mineralize
skinfinish and put the help of the face
to give me more of a skin finish back
and not make
so flat and math like we had it already
because of the pillars and powder and
then taking hoola by benefit and amor
Fiji - I'm really gonna start carving
out the cheekbones well I'm gonna start
bronzing and then carving out later but
this is such a fun step this is what's
really gonna make my face transform from
being like so manly to being a little
more soft and feminine so I'm really
concentrating that on the cheekbones and
the temples I have a very manly forehead
so and Ameri very manly jawline so I
want to carve out that jawline a little
bit more taking a more precise brush
from Smith's I think and then just
starting to carve out with a hoola color
and now taking my makeup geek chisel
cheek brush and the Kat Von D shade
light palette I'm taking that really
intense grayish Brown and really start
to carve out the places I want to be a
little more soft so my cheekbones the
jawline and the temples on my forehead
we really want to carve out that area
and then taking the translucent powder
again from Laura Mercier I'm gonna start
carving out and baking the underneath of
my cheekbones to give me more of a clean
contour look this is like we're cooking
the contour so as you can see I'm kind
of like rounding it out at the edges too
to give me more of a high lifted
cheekbone and then dusting it away after
10 minutes with my morphe gzo and then
and then you can literally see how sharp
and clean that contour is such a cool
step this is such a cool like easy way
to accentuate your cheekbones then I'm
grabbing the Kat Von D shade light
yellowish shade putting that all over
the eye just to kind of make it more
brighten awake and then contouring my
nose I have a manly nose I have a manly
big nose so I was gonna contour slightly
and then move on I'm gonna go and grab
me morphe 3 and some really bright pink
blushes from Tarte and start going in
with that blush girl like we want to
blush up that face sarah has kind of a
slight so she I'm sure she blushes all
the time and so we're gonna go ahead and
put some blush all of this cheeks like a
bomb curl your lashes again I told you
guys I'm gonna be jumping around curl my
lashes putting on mascara roller lash on
top from benefit and the mac gigablack
lash for the bottom lashes it looks so
bomb and now I'm taking Russian black
buy new bounce them and adding a little
bit of House of lashes little
individuals to make it look like a
really big intense a drag lash for me I
love the way the lashes look
and then I'm taking so the lips is kind
of a funny story so I went in first with
Urban Decay venom trying to make it like
look like Sarah's but I was like no it's
too purple so I went with Mac Burgundy
after to make it look more maroon cuz
Sarah has more of a maroon like deep
dark lip going on and then I went with
Jeffrey star liquid lipstick and Red Rum
thinking like oh it's gonna be great to
be dark with the dark lip liner no it
stayed pretty cherry so I was like no I
need to go with urban decay shame to
make a more moon and more deep and
really intense and after seeing that I
was like dude yes this is the color of
Sarah's lips I'm obsessed with her
Minich a shame I love the revolution
lipsticks the matte ones I die for them
and I think it looks so bomb so Sarah
and then the final touch of course we
need to do the little Mole that
searching school Parker has in the movie
it's such an iconic little Mole and I
was like I cannot be Sarah without it
and this is the final look I hope you
