socha video is going to be a tutorial on
this look I have going on right now it
is a really cool really intense like
burgundy maroon eyeshadow look so I
don't hope you guys like this look I had
so much fun creating actually asked on
Twitter and on snapchat what you guys
wanted to see next I got so many
requests to do it in a maroon and
burgundy eyeshadow smokey eye and I'm
like you know what that sounds so fun
that's so up my alley I love like shades
like this so I'm like you don't I'm
gonna do it for you guys I think this
was Thanksgiving appropriate as well as
like holidays and it's just like such a
fun festive look about this look too so
it's very different it's not like the
average like smokey eye it's a red
burgundy maroon smokey eye not a lot of
people like do things like this usually
it's like black or brown and that's
about it and I think you guys should
definitely I doubt honestly like be
brave and jump out of your comfort zone
and do more like intense like colorful
things it'll turn out bomb I swear to
you just have faith in yourself and it
will look bomb calm and just know that
it's gonna look good okay as always if
you guys like this video if you guys
still like me please don't watch
it you know the joking thing but if you
guys you like this video and you guys do
like me please like this video and
subscribe to my channel if you're not
already yeah than that let's just go and
get into this tutorial and I'll talk to
you guys soon what I'm actually gonna go
and do the ice first and the face second
I usually do like my face person my
second but kind of once you switch it up
a little bit you know I'm saying so I'm
gonna do my most first and the things
playing out or you know my eyes are
primed with the Smashbox primer 12 hour
of course this is the best primer of
life I actually really want to go like
old school right now with some shadows
I'm gonna be using some Mac eye shadows
this is like the first quad I ever made
AB Mac this is like the first forever by
purchased from Mac by myself so I'm
gonna use some shadows from this first
I'm gonna take this soft brown by Mac on
a morphe 27 of course fluffy blending
brush you guys need one this is one they
should get trust a bitch it is good I
put that into the crease soft brown is a
beautiful neutral transitioning shade
kinda reminds me of a darker version of
Peach Smoothie by makeup geek I'm gonna
take actually kind of far up cuz this is
gonna be more of a smokey eye I've
already decided
taking it out slightly I'm gonna take my
morphe tin 4-3-3 and Mac Brown script
which is a very very warm red and brown
it is gorgeous I love this matte shade I
just I was like digging through my like
stuff today and I found like these matte
colors that I'm using forever so I'm
like let me use them
but so I'm going to take brown script
into the crease look how gorgeous that
shot you guys like getting that's going
to go pretty far up into the crease as
you can see it's a very very warm red
into brown it's very it's kind of
similar to like cocoa bear by makeup
geek but a little bit deeper I would say
each one seven blended out I really want
this look to be very like dimensional
and really just badass and with a lot of
like to mention it with a lot of
different colors in it so now taking a
combination of Mac Swiss chocolate and
embark on that scene in four three three
I'm going to take that in the lower part
of my crease outer corner first and into
the crease whoo
I just take this clean and four-for-one
by morphe just to kind of clean up I'm
just gonna blend the edges out a little
bit more you just can never like have
enough blending going on I promise you
now taking the Urban Decay perversion
pencil I'm gonna run that all over the
lid
whoa by the lash line and then onto the
lid this is such a creamy liner I'm I'm
kind of obsessed with this one honestly
like I'm obsessed it's such a creamy
like Kohl pencil super super black I
have no complaints right now I'm
dude like not a single complaint in 508
by morphe and blending out the black gel
liner this is one of the easiest liners
to blend out I swear it is you got that
going on now I'm taking makeup geek
bitten which is a very deep burgundy ish
maroon shade you know anybody know I'm
so obsessed with bitten like this is not
something new like this is two bigs back
then and so I'm going to take a morphe
32 packing brush amazing packing brush
and I'm going to pack that on the inner
and outer corner of the black gel liner
load the bitch up like load it and you
start packing I really want it to be on
the inner and outer corner just kind of
taking a little more on the import
screen just blending out those edges
nothing to him
and then using that same ether tea to
just kind of wipe it off if you want you
don't want to it's all good I'm gonna
take the Kat Von D me beat Aloka palette
and I'm going to take the shade rewind
which is a really cool shimmery maroon
color here I'm going to pack down the
center of the lid I just pack the bad
boy on
it is a gorgeous like shiny maroon shade
so then let's do a little bit of
highlighting on the brow bone like a
real subtle mount I'm gonna take the
shade right here Mulder
mold Mulder some take that on a more vm4
- - so that's just gonna go on to my
brow bone just to give me some more
highlight back in it because in a drink
when you're blending out like this like
when you're going crazy with the
blending and you're like blending out so
high you really start to lose the
highlight on the brow bone so you really
want to keep that there and make sure
that it looks nice and bright and
highlighted because I'm gonna go to the
other eye off camera now and just pray
that it turns out similar because I just
did so many steps on this I'm have to
re-watch what I just did it may be like
okay what I do cuz I was just looking
around
okay it's pretty close it's pretty good
it's not it's not identical but I mean
whose eyes are identical really so now
we're to the bottom of it no I came to
the bottom yet have to do the face well
 have that part kind of hard cuz I
was gonna do the bottom I don't put
concealer on or anything you know I can
do those it try doing so I decided I'm
gonna go and do a wing I'm gonna take
the English 77 gel liner and my winged
liner brush by Sigma the eo6 to do an
intense figure swing or no homo
yeah the brush is kind of up
because it was inside my brush bag and I
didn't secure it so it's kind of like
janky I'm just cleaning up after who
gets liner perfect on the first I'm not
I ok biznatch is let's do the face I'm
going to talk through obviously I doing
talk to us it was funny is like I love
doing to talk to is like I feel so
awkward doing voiceovers like I feel
like I kind of want to get to doing both
though like I want to be a multi-faceted
multi-talented youtuber and I want to be
able to do voiceovers and talk through
so let me know if you guys like doing
voiceovers or talk to us more I
personally like talk to you guys let's
do more personal they are oh I wanna be
able to do both because I want to be a
multi-faceted youth or you know I'm
gonna take the dr. Brandt pores no more
primer I use actually use this all the
time when I worked at Sephora I
completely forgot about it it is a
primer but it's also a pore refiner
they're actually gonna be really nice
for people that have real
intense pores in the t-zone and wherever
else you have really bad pores so now
for the foundation I kind of want to mix
two up I wanna take the Maybelline fit
me matte poreless mixed with the Born
This Way by Too Faced the boiling point
back to the face I really want to love
it I want to love it
more than I want to let a lot of things
kind of weird I want to love it but I
feel like it breaks up on me like
throughout the day and it kind of annoys
me so I'm gonna go ahead and mix these
two and see that combination works out
this is like a the Maybelline is a
mattifying foundation and to face one is
a little bit more like Dulli ish so I
hope that like combination will maybe
make it last longer on my skin them
should take my morphe M 439 and buff the
bitch in think of it with a little too
much okay
get your ears to I get called out for my
ears being read sometimes because I
forget to cover them with foundation
dude it looks really pretty mixed
together like this looks really nice
honestly like I'm really impressed with
this combination because I think it
looks beautiful it's like not like so
mad it gives me like a satin finish full
apps coverage like full coverage looks
gorge I am so excited for a freaking
Thanksgiving guys like I am beyond
excited I love Thanksgiving because it's
such a fun holiday to like all you found

you know how I am about golden glitters
like Deus do you see that like I have a
real problem with this highlighter
because I'm so obsessed with it
I really hope you guys get your hands on
it because it is stunning
it definitely accentuates the texture on
your face like if you have texture or if
you have like any pimples whatever you
have like anything like that it will
definitely enhance that that's a
precaution of Sun you guys know I don't
give a I have texture on my face no

take Mac Melba blush
I just went out I bought so much Mac
stuff recently that I just like have to
use it you know what I mean so I'm gonna
take you morphe for a Mac Melba it is
like this gorgeous pinky peach shade
it's matte and I love it right between
the highlighter and the contour I love
Mac a lot see Mac blushes are so bomb
like they kill it for blushes and like
in my opinion I think that they do
really nice blush is I'm gonna dust away
my cookin now it cools now that we have
the face basically done I'm just going
to do lips last I'm gonna go to finish
the bottom of the eyes right now because
I need to finish the face before the
eyes so I'm going to Pat grabbed her
version pencil again by urban decay and
I'm gonna put that on the waterline
I want this up to be real smoky guys
like I just do like I want smoky I want
to be enhance all the way to the inner
corner all the way and pull all the way
in go ahead and take the M 5:08 again
and blended that bad boy out basically
what we did on the top of the eye were
gonna join the bottom as well we're
gonna blend it now taking that bintang
shade that we used previously we're take
bitten any morphe 36 and blend out with
that black shade just to kind of give me
that nice warm intense shade that we
have going on on the top I want to be
the same thing on the bottom I wanted to
really warm an intense and maroon but
how that on I piled it on if you
have colored eyes this look is really
going to help accentuate those as well
because it is so warm you have blue eyes
if you have green eyes like it's gonna
look really sick with your eyes I have
hazel eye so I think it's going to
accentuate my eyes make my eyes look a
little bit more green now taking a Mac
Brown script one more time just keep
blending away I'm just gonna keep piling
colors of it under here to give you some
really cool intense like dimension Mac
soft brown
so I went ahead and chrome eyelashes off
of camera and put mascara on the top the
roller lash my benefit I'm gonna go and
put some extent if I can go back by Mac
on the bottom before I put on the
falsies because you guys already know
I'm the foxy queen and I will be wearing
false lashes today so for the lashes I
want to go ahead and do the New Balance
on pair of lashes and Serengeti I have
been obsessing with Serengeti recently
I've just been like loving them so much
Doka me wrong Bella is still my number
one Bella by Davone some is my favorite
lash by far they're very dramatic that
right wispy they're amazing this month I
just been really loving these Serengeti
lashes they're really cool the really
intense are also really wispy and now
that the lashes are on the eye is
complete let's go exam you guys need to
see what the eye looks like up close
and closes other face is basically done
I'm gonna go into the lips and be done
with the look I'm gonna go ahead and
fill my lips in or like lip line with
NYX penguin neutral I feel like I
haven't used fimo neutral and so long
like on camera I mean I use it everyday
but on camera X like I haven't use in
forever so the final lips guys use
whatever I definitely keep it on the
more neutral lip because my eye is
deftly more intense and more bold and I
really want the focus to be on the ice
for me so I'm gonna go ahead and do a
natural lip my hands for like that goes
mmm and now for the lipstick I've
actually never used this on camera
before or in general I've never used
these I'm gonna go ahead and take the
two-faced lipsticks just like the one in
the gold bullet I'm gonna take this
shade naked dolly which is a very nude
like creamy satiny finish lipstick
I thought I would look really pretty
with this look and this is what the
final lip and face looks like what you
