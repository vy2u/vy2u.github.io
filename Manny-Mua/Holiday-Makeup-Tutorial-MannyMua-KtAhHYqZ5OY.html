today's video is going to be a glam
ass-fuck holiday makeup tutorial I have
been dying to film some holiday
tutorials I had some super awesome
inspiration that you guys sent me from
Twitter I've been loving them I've been
really wanting to do something really
holiday really festive and I really want
to incorporate green again I did a green
smokey eye recently and I loved it I
loved how turned out I was like I wanna
do another green smokey eye but kind of
make it more holiday more festive and
more Christmassy if that makes sense
this is what I came up with and I think
it looks absolutely stunning I used a
bunch of new products in today's video
which I loved but yeah you guys do the
drill guys don't this appeal if you guys
don't like me please don't watch
it you guys are Lajoie if you guys have
any nasty comments don't even leave them
here because I will not read them and
I'll block your ass so quickly
quick but if you guys like this video
and you guys do like me please like this
video and subscribe to my channel if you
weren't already yeah than that I'm gonna
start rambling I feel like a ramble a
lot during the intro so imma stop
rambling now let's go and get into this
holiday glam look alright so let's go
and start this tutorial I'm gonna be
doing a full face today I want to be
really glam and really just like yeah I
want to get it all up in there so I hope
you guys don't mind that I'm doing a
full face I love you guys love it want
to do full face full of you guys just
like damn it you take so damn long and
I'm like I know right sorry so first
things first I'm gonna take the Marc
Jacobs invisible cover primer it's like
the coconut primer I've heard really
good things about this primer so I'm
hoping that it's gonna be bomb it feels
so lightweight it's like literally like
a watery consistency it feels beautiful
feels so beautiful now for foundation
I'm gonna go ahead and grab let me gonna
grab what kind of fun to show into you
today
hold up I'm going to take my trusty
loriel Pro matte infallible in the shade
103 natural buff and that's going to go
into the t-zone
I'm really oily in the t-zone area so
that's so I'm gonna put a mattifying
foundation in the t-zone and I'm gonna
go on with more of like a satiny one for
the face so just kind of going with the
Beauty Blender
pressing that onto the nose area
basically wherever I get oily is where
I'm gonna put this I recently had like a
bad reaction to something on my face I
don't know what it was but like I woke
up one morning and like I had like red
bumps all of my face specifically in the
t-zone area so I'm still like kind of
getting over that I guess I don't know
what it was I'm kind of bummed out
because I have like texture all over my
skin right now I just got this chemical
peel done which was so amazing and now
like totally ruined it you know so I'm
kind of pissed off about that but you
live and you learn
I mean do you really though because I
don't know what the like it was and then
for the face dress I thinks I'm gonna go
in with my trusty trustee trustee Dior
air flash honestly is like when I hear
foundations of all time it's so stunning
on a morphe six brush so my favorite way
to apply it is on a kabuki brush
spraying the brush don't be out okay
there we go
it's gonna shatter me I just have all on
the cheeks first and I kind of go out
from there I'm in the shade 300 this is
probably a little bit too dark for me
but I like to go a little bit more tan
with my foundation anyway I just dip on
this foundation because I like to keep
the coverage there giving myself as much
coverage as possible get your ears to
and then on my neck I'm gonna going with
the powder so just kind of leave your
neck alone for now because we'll go back
to that leader perfect so now we have
the foundation part on the face it's
looking good I love this foundation I
freaking a little bit now the one
concealer I just recently got to the
mail like literally today the new maker
forever Ultra HD
concealers like I even know these came
out I don't know if they're even out yet
right now like what the hell I just got
in the mail I'm in the shade y23 I think
wow so we're gonna try this cute little
thing
I don't know they just look balm is how
I'm talking try right now I'm just gonna
go ahead and conceal oh okay it's
consistency very lightweight and it
looks like medium to full coverage yes
yes yes and then another new part I want
to use I just have a lot of new products
on yesterday when I was up in San
Francisco benefit showed me some other
new products after launching soon one of
them is the shy beam which is basically
like the high beam and the like Sun beam
but like a matte version of it what's a
little more brightening a little more
peachy err tone so I'm actually going to
use that to highlight the face as well
it has like a very like peachy pinky
undertone but it's a matte shade it's
not gonna be this I just like the sample
size one like I know that how it looks I
was like look how so Allah says
no there's a full-size one I don't have
that one you only have a small baby
sample of it but look how brightening it
is you guys know I had to go intense
taking my morphe in for 3/8 and Laura
Mercier under-eye brightening powder my
tried and true just gonna set on dry but
I'm loving the way this looks combined
oh so bright and so beautiful you guys
think mm-hmm and I'm gonna go and take
shy beam on other spots my face I want
to highlight just
right on the face because you when you
highlight underneath the eye you want a
highlight other spots of the face
because you just honestly it's just too
much I feel like it just kind of brings
too much focus to this under eye area
and you really want to kind of balance
out everything I love this shy beam so
now except the face I'm going to be
taking the Urban Decay Naked ultra
definition loose setting powder I tried
this out for the first time yesterday
and I was living for how silky smooth it
is Patrick told me about this like he
like loved it and I was like really
and whenever Patrick tells me he loves a
product but I like usually licitum
because he knows his so I use this
yesterday and I loved it I'm in the
shade medium light I don't know I'm just
glad set the face with it this is an HD
powder with a morphe G zero as usual
it's just such a silky smooth powder
like I'm really honestly impressed how
come I've never like heard of this
powder or like used it or try to or
anything do other people use this powder
because it's so silky smooth and
beautiful it's like insane ahh ahh
can we just take some powder down my
neck because I look like a bronze
goddess up here and a pale ghost do down
here so I'm take the Mac and c25 to go
fix powder and wear that down my neck
just give me some color down here cuz I
feel like I'm just looking a little too
pale hello to paste it so six I'm
wearing like a v-neck to through see my
real my real color down there that's not
cute that is not cute you down your chi
chi's where's my bronzing brush
fall I'm not getting a friend so I'm
gonna go ahead and grab hoola bronzer by
benefit of course obsession got on my
morphe e to brush I'm just kind of
bronze up the skin with this starting on
the temples this time just kind of
lightly just kind of bronzing up the
skin not contour here anything like that
yeah I'm just kind of bronzing up
everywhere so now I'm gonna go and punch
out the face a little bit I'm gonna take
the makeup geek chisel cheek brush I
already know them to go more intense on
the ice today like I want to go real
structured on the face whatever I'm
doing like a smokey eye or anything like
more intense I love to do a really nice
contour a nice highlight you cannot do a
freakin intense a smoky eye and your
face be like bland like who the not
on this world bitch uh-huh not my
 coal Locke who she's sassy today
so I'm gonna have to face with my morphe
and 510 brush and Mac oh darling I'm
sorry if you guys didn't get it I swear
I'm so sorry but I'm so obsessed with
this highlighter like I've not put it
down like I'm obsessed since I bought it
like I've used it constantly like all
the time this is just my go-to right now
oh look at this
let's really load up that Cupid's bow
I'm also gonna take a new blush I just
recently got this is from japonesque
this is in the shade Velvet Touch it's
like a very just peachy pinky shape oh
it's beautiful shut the up
stop beautiful just kind of blend my
contour and highlight together a little
bit it's a very light wash of color if
you guys want like an intense blush
that's a crazy super pigmented that's
not this is not the blush for you but if
you guys want a little Jimmy or some
something a little soft thing this is
the blush for you okay great so we're
done with the face and now it's going to
start on the eyes you my favorite part
perfect so when I did my brows
off-camera and I kind of primed my eyes
off the camera as budget because it was
just gonna be easier that way and you
guys have seen me do eyebrows a bunch of
times I'm like you know what we're not
subject you guys to have to deal with
that again and then you I wanted to use
this so badly could when I soon as I got
it I was like I need to use this hello
TARDIS to palate are you joking die
worthy so go ahead and take my morphe 27
which is like a little fluffy blending
brush and I'm gonna take the shade of
smarty-pants which is like a really
pretty like brownish transition shade
I'm gonna take that into the crease
oh that is maybe dead holy okay um
blend that out I just grabbed a bunch on
the brush did not realize using me
something went in whoa okay so she looks
something like this then I'm gonna take
my morphe m4 33 and the shade rebel it's
a very warm brown and I'm with the on
the outer corner and into the crease as
well lower than we have Marty pants I
open this part so I can see where I'm
depositing the color especially because
like I have a hooded lid like to know
exactly like if I my eyes open like
where's the color gonna stop you know so
I'm putting it there and then I going to
take that you 27 again just kind of
blend out those edges a little bit not
too much because I still want it to be a
nice like transition and then same in 43
and the shade leader oh this is like a
plum ish Brown dark rich plum II Brown
it's over here and then that's going to
go even lower than the last shade then
rebel and into the crease as well and
then with lighter pressure we're going
to go a little bit farther into the eye
like closer to the inner corner you 27
just kind of blending it again let's go
and take the darker shade right above
leader which is this one right here it's
called activist on a morphe and the e36
pression that's gonna go even lower so
this is gonna be like a real hardcore
transition right now
that's gonna go the absolute lowest
possible and that's all we're not going
to put it too far in or anything like
that and then
going to kind of blend out that color
even more so this is what our high looks
like so far
tonight's just like warmish brownish eye
dark on the outer corner and kind of
light in the in the crease and then
we're starting to get party work I start
to go somewhere we're going somewhere
now so now I'm gonna take the morphe 12z
palette which is a new house that he
just launched this palette right here
absolute it's stunning stunning but what
I really was loving was this dark green
this forest es green I wanted to put
that on the lid so we're gonna do it on
the lid so we're gonna take a e30 to
dense packing brush and I load up that
green shade and that's going to go all
over the lid and all the way up into the
crease up to the Browns as well so go
and take your m4 three three one more
time and just go ahead and start
blending out those edges very softly I'm
not gonna do a lot of hardcore blending
I just want it to be a hard line and
then on top of the green we're not done
yet with the lid we're not done I'm
going to take the Urban Decay moon dust
shadow in the shade of Scorpio which is
like a very like dark green with gold
reflection using my finger oh my god I
just packing that on Oh I'm living for
this right now
it's like Christmas tree at sex with the
disco ball that's what it looks like
right now if you want to ensure this
lasts even longer on the eyes you can go
and use a glitter glue on top of the
green just to make sure that everything
kind of stays but at least that way
it'll ensure it's gonna stay on a lot
longer on the eyes so this is what the
top of that eye looks like I think looks
freakin badass I'm gonna go finish the
top of the eye on the other side and
I'll be right back okay great so the
tops of the eyes are basically done I
know it looks kind of like not super
blended but this is this blended as I
could go that Munda shadows are kind of
hard to blend out not gonna lie
so now we have the top of the eyes done
let's go into the bottom of the eyes -
basically what we did on the top we're
gonna join the bottom so I'm taking
perversion liner by urban decay which is
a black eye liner it's like my favorite
black eye liner so creamy so black so
good and precise to the waterline I'm
gonna take it all the way in oh yeah
then taking morphine 5:08 just go and
blend out that gel liner and then taking
the e36 again just start to blend out
and transition out that black color
taking the rebel color first from the
tardis palette start to blend out that
black so I really want to do something
fun for the inner part of my eye in the
bottom lash line so what I decided to do
is I'm gonna grab the Too Faced glitter
glue looks like this or just take a
little small detail brush I want to put
that underneath right here just on the
inner the third of my eye
this is the number 66 body sparkles in
silver by Inglot which is gorgeous so
we're going to put that on the inner
third of our lower lash line it's just I
feel like it's it looks so sick so we're
doing it to 5:08 again by morphine just
dip some of it into the cap and press on
over the Too Faced glitter glue now curl
your eyelashes and put some mascara on
okay so I went ahead I put on lashes off
camera as well I'm wearing the new bound
some lashes in dragon Lee which is a
very dramatic tapered lash so let me go
and show you guys to the eyes up close
really good and now that the eyes are
done let's go and finish up with a list
and then that'll be the final step and
we'll be done so I'm going to lip line
first of course you guys know I'm a lip
line in free I have two lip line all the
time so I'm gonna take my trusty trusty
and Nix peekaboo neutral I'm gonna go
very neutral very nude on the lip today
because the dramatics is in the eyes and
I want to keep it there I don't want it
to be anywhere else besides the
structured face of course but you know
I'm playing and then actually just got
this in the mail today also and I really
wanted to try it out because I've been
seeing it all over Instagram and I was
like I need that color now it is the
drawer cosmetics angel cake lip cream
it's a super super super light nude
color and I've been really into like
pale almost non-existent lists so I
think this is gonna go really well with
it that's like a little doe foot
applicator oh look oh no that is I love
it the smell it's like it's like a
fruity berry issues smell apparently the
I'm not really a fan of that kind of
smell I don't like the smell of it very
much but you guys like fruity smells
this is your smell mmm I think these are
like a hybrid between make the lipstick
and a lip gloss I'm assuming this what
it is it's like I took a non sticky
really comfortable formula I like it I
like it and this is the final look
and that's it that's it for the entire
video hope you guys had fun watching
