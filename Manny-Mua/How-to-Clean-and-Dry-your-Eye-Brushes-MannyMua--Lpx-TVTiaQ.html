so today's video is going to be how I
wash and clean my brush and that's the
same thing how I wash and dry my brushes
probably guys are doing great I feel
like I felt whenever I start my intro
with like hey guys what's up so I'm
doing like I feel like it's not like
person zone enough I want to be like hey
guys how are you how's your thing how's
your little money going you know this
video shouldn't be too long and too hard
yeah so if you guys want to see how I
wash and dry my brushes keep watching if
you guys are like this kind of video do
not watch it you know the drill
have an ombre lip going you know she's
feeling herself today so just do not
even watch the video but let's do you
guys want to see how I clean and dry my
eye brushes like a little quick have a -
thank you watching I know I process is
pretty simple you know it's a pretty
easy thing so this is this method is
like how I do my eyebrows so when I'm
not doing like a huge variety of like a
huge amount of brushes this is what I do
I if you guys are anything like me you
probably only clean like five brushes at
a time I have so many brushes like I
don't know if you came into the entire
thing is all brushes so I have so many
brushes and I do not like to clean all
of them at one time like I just it's
just not my thing I like to do like five
to ten at a time just just what I like
to do I'm not like one of those big like
let me just do like watch 300 so this is
like the mess that I do for my iowans so
what we're going to be using that might
feature cute little product on the lane
is going to be the bomb Beauty cleaning
egg things stop these little like brush
like cleaners hmm I have to I think my
mom stole the other ones I have I'm a
hot pink well there's another one who's
like a hot-ass pink one and I think
she's talking cuz I cannot find in my
room anyway I'm so yeah these were said
to me by Bob Beauty so thank you guys so
much I want Beauty for sending them to
me I really love them and reason I love
them is one because they're so adorable
and like I'm a bitch when it comes to
gimmicky things like if it's cute and
the packaging is adorable and it's like
small tiny like I'm it needs to be mine
like I don't know if you guys are like
that but that's how I am especially
that works like mine give it to me
now go do a little demo I'm gonna leave
it right here in the sections on my
little face is gonna go over to the pine
so this is just what I like to do I like
to use the Beauty Blender solid cleanser
to do it with and I've already hit pan
on this one on if you can even tell okay
so this is what I like to do I like to
rub my brush under water first
dip it into the Beauty Blender solid
cleanser just a little like quick
one-two like little swirl and then I'll
kind of grab my little egg put my
fingers to it and now just kind of do
like a one two swipe a little swirl and
the divots of it because the divots are
actually pretty deep so if you really
are cleaning a lot of the brush so
that's kind of what I do with like more
of the fluffy brushes if I'm using a
small more dense brush like more of an
eye detail brush I like to use a little
like grooves that are at the top of the
little egg thingy now just kind of run
that in there it's a dense silicone like
material so it really does clean when
you're running it through it like a
groove like this the solid cleanser is
really great at picking up any dirt and
grime that you might have in the brush
the necktie bacterial so it really
cleans deep too I think the combination
of the Beauty Blender slide cleanser and
a nice deep cleaning silicone e-type
material feel like it just gets a deeper
into the ferrule to the bristles like
this is a janky part is how I draw it
okay this is like the kind of drink you
drink so I chose I'll grab my paper
cut it in half your basic like peels
like to apply it to to put my little
brush in the middle of it and I'll just
I kind of wrap it because not only will
it dry the brushes it'll keep the form
of the bristles instead of having to go
out and buy like those little nets for
the brushes why don't you just use like
so toilet paper it's gonna dry it and
it's gonna keep the form really well as
long as you're like tying it pretty
tightly so actually have like the ones I
used in the video so they're right here
I let them dry overnight I filmed that
last night like don't my part so this is
what they end up looking like when you
take them off complete form like look at
my morphe i-43 and my Sigma e-40 like
the form is completely complete and
they're dry I just think this is a
really simple easy free way to dry your
brushes you know I'm I'm all about the
cost-efficient kind of style of things
so I like the fact that the brushed
cleaner like it sells like ten bucks and
the solid cleanser is like also I think
ten bucks MIT sure how much this is I've
gotten two of them I just literally just
don't have I'm asking like pay quite a
shame obviously twelve paper is free if
you if your parents buy it for you
but yeah you know I think it's just an
easy way if you guys are anything like
me and you like to just create a couple
brushes out of time which I do so often
then you guys will like it I know you
will like it for sure you know and the
same concept applies about if you're
washing your face brushes I'm just like
a fan of using silicone cleaners because
it's just easier X honestly it's just
easier for me it's faster for me this
just does all the work for me instead of
using on my fingers when I used to work
at Sephora I'm gonna clean the brushes
at the end of the night I swear to you
if we just had some type of silicone
cleaner or like the Sigma mat or like
one of them on beauty like it would've
been so much easier than having to do
run into our hands all the time it was
such a pain in the ass dude it was a
pain in the ass oh also with the balm
beauty on they did actually send me a
code to use if you guys didn't want to
buy one of them I'm sure a lot of people
have not heard of balm Beauty before
these little like these little eggs I
think it's really cool and the back the
little divots on the back you can use
like it to clean my computer but it's
like squeeze out like the dirt from it
because it has little grooves on the
back I just think they thought of
everything with a ski little thing I do
actually have a little 15% off code with
him it's Manny mu8 you guys type it into
the site you get 15% off or if you buy
more than one I think it's like you get
30% off that's pretty cool right cool it
is a commission code so I do make a
small amount I like to tell you guys
those same kind of things so if you guys
are interested in buying one um you just
say 15% off and I do get a small
Commission of it but of course some guys
are not interested and using a
commission hoe during that I totally
understand they're the ones that offered
me to do a little interesting about like
you know what why not save the money for
my subs and followers and I get a little
a little small collection so I figured
you know what let's just do that
and you know I think the product SKU and
I think it's totally worth it I really
really really really really do I think
my favorite one is the hoppy but I wish
I could show you guys because I don't
have it that's like the black one hasn't
literally - I think they're so cute and
they're 10 bucks like really the Sigma
matte is like 25 to 30 like other ones
are much more expensive so I think this
is just really cool of all the cleaners
like cleansers I have it's probably like
the one I have that's the fastest and
most efficient
purchase doing a quick like I brush you
don't mean bomb Beauty little wings the
little hangs on the mom you and the
toilet paper check out the toilet paper
- if you guys are interested in that
 oh yeah that was it for the video
hopeful you guys enjoyed this video it's
a very just quick easy how I clean and
dry my brushes or at least my eye ones I
can always do a video on how I do like
my face ones or like from doing a big
huge amount at one time what I like to
use for that this is just what I like to
use for eye brushes and quick like quick
on-the-go things they dry fast they
clean fast it's just easy it's so easy
this way for me so because it is kind of
video give it a thumbs up
