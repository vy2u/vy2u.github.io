knowledge because I do work for Mac so
I'm just trying to help you guys get
into the door especially your dream and
I'm going to get you there so let's do
this okay cool let's get this bitch
started I have like a like I
literally I wrote down notes I'm okay
what am I going to tell my followers so
that they can get inside Mac so we're
gonna do it okay so number one how to
get there mean mixing my notes okay
combat so first things first know why
you want to work for Mac like what is it
about Mac that makes you want to work
for them is it that they're a great
company is it that the cheetah workers
well is it that they're very well known
in the cosmetic industry why is it that
you want to work for Mac that'll be a
big help if you're passionate about it
then you'll be able to see it that
you're passionate about it okay so
that's number one just know why you want
to work for Mac and that's something
that you want to do full-time or not
just okay number two second thing to
know know the history of Mac and how it
all got create I had okay so Mac stands
for make up our cosmetics and it was
co-created by Frank Angelo and Frank
Tuscan in Ontario Canada in 1984 okay so
it started in Canada and I exit Amy Ford
and they started with a chemist friend
I'll start it in a kitchen so which I
mean which is pretty cool like they just
started this whole brand and kitchen
with the chemist that is sake and then
and then and then the first store the
first US store was opened in 1991 in New
York in a Nordstrom and Nordstrom
carried a Mac for the first year and Mac
was like okay well we need to expand out
of Nori's so they expand it out okay
Estee Lauder now controls not controls
come on
like crazy SLR now owns mac cosmetics it
is under the este ruling who worked for
Mackey worked for Esther day and they
acquired a full stock control in 1998
cool another huge thing about the
history no these social responsibilities
of mac this is ah this is huge for mac
huge so these are things you're going to
need to know for sure know about the
Viva Glam program I'm not going to
really talk about like in depth each
program if you really are passionate
about working for Mac you're going to
look that up I'm just giving you
the deets on machine okay so no Viva
Glam program no the back to Mac
recycling program
no the Mac Pro program know about the
MAC AIDS Fund and know about the Kids
Helping Kids program right Mac and those
are all the social responsibilities to
the Mac oh my god lying anymore like in
here so there's all these social
sensibilities of Mac Mac is huge on this
like as a company they're so so amazing
because they are so awful to the
community and they helped so many people
throughout their like throughout their
lives you know it means so this is a
great thing about Mac and this is
something you should really know about
Mac is that they are awesome about
social responsibilities huh like hey
what's this know the Mac motto the motto
is all ages all races all sexes it's
might not be in that order that's the
gist of it all ages all races all sexes
so if you're transgender if you're gay
or lesbian if you're a butch queen if
you are a fairy it doesn't matter you
know you can work for Mac you know what
I mean Mac is awesome with that they
love diversity so if you're diverse
applying okay okay enough with the
history okay now you guys know the
history you know langu shade about Mac
it's Julianne
this is really important this isn't like
this is something that imamat not a lot
of people talk about but I think it's
great idea
you go into a counter that you really
want to work for okay you're like okay
this is the counter right love I love
this counter I go to this one all the
time doesn't that funny so you go to
that counter and basically you make
friends with the girls and the boys that
are working there the management you
make friends with everyone okay we
should be doing is like going very often
like if not very often where you seem
like a stalker
but going often enough where they know
they know your face and like oh hey you
like how are you ended up having that
automatic rapport with this counter
really really really really help with
your chances of an application or like
talking about them about working for mac
okay so make friends with the counter I
think that's a new braid and really make
friends at the management cuz that's a
really good idea okay okay you made
friends you guys are best thing you've
talked to the girls or boys about
wanting to apply there and they're like
okay like once you apply so now you're
gonna apply I know I'm sweating for you
guys already know so first things we're
gonna do is you're gonna dress in all
black business casual I'm talking in
black head-to-toe that nor just attire
okay um your makeup you want to be beat
face cut fish for your nerve you wanted
to look bomb you makeup for a girl if
your girl my suggestion I would just do
like do like a maybe like an easy smoky
eye with a nude lip have like medium
coverage on bronze contour just you want
to show that you could actually apply
makeup not necessarily I'm not saying
going like a clown I'm saying just want
to show that you're skilled in the
makeup application on yourself okay so
they know that boys just go in with what
I got on like I have like some bronzer
you'll need to go in with lipstick you
can you don't even have to go on with
makeup like guys are required to wear
makeup at Mac girls are required to wear
makeup I'm at the guys aren't I just
think it's better because it shows that
you can do it on yourself and Selena
like you can do it on other people okay
so this is what I went in basically this
is the look I went in with have a little
bit of eyeliner on the bottom doing some
definition but I went in with a nude lip
foundation bronzer blush highlighter
looking really proudly that's how I went
in okay next bringing your resume with
you obviously don't bring your knowledge
okay I wrote down not Lynch down here
bring your knowledge and why I'm saying
this because sometimes the managers will
be like oh my god thinks we write too
many so why do you want work from that
what do you know about Mac they will say
that she they will literally turn a
trick your ass and your sometimes people
were just caught off guard like uh I
wasn't hanger than like just be prepared
like that they can do that okay so just
come with the knowledge like I had said
like the history before the beginning
part of this video about the history
knowing before you go in trust trust a
bitch okay you're going to go in you're
going to ask whoever you got to ask for
the manager the manager is gonna come
out you get ahead shake your head
introduce yourself hi my name is
some and I want to play for a Mac so if
you know the people at the counter it's
going to be great to be easy for you you
didn't already know if the management is
it's gonna be fine if you don't seem a
little more nerve-wracking but that's
why I'm saying you should go in and make
friends with everyone that's gonna work
if you do that I swear to god I'm just
yeah ask for that application and you'll
give it to you you're gonna take it and
you're gonna go fill the out you're
next you're gonna ask the manager ok
cool when can I come back to return my
application to you and the bed okay I'm
working this day go the day that they
say that working like you want to turn
it in to the manager you don't wanna
turn it into some brainless girl because
you can be like look you're not even -
I'm not doing your application wait just
kidding they're not gonna do that but uh
just make sure you give it to a manager
you're gonna come off more professional
giving to the manager okay number four
wait
the waiting game I know it's the worms I
know just wait for them to call you
honestly like if they are interested in
you they will be calling you and if they
if they tell you do not call us we will
call you if you're interested don't call
them they're being serious they're not
like joking around like a dumb pile and
you call back three days later they're
being serious like they're busy as a
Heil like let them call your ass if they
don't say that then maybe call I would
say give it a week give them a week to
mull over your applications and that
call to remind them that you are still
interested in applying for Mack and
still working for them okay that's I
would say just call back seven days
later number five you got the interview
first of all you're gonna be jumping up
and down for joy because you were ready
how furious and they're jumping up and
down you're like yes I got interviewing
guy yeah yeah okay so I'm just saying
you guys right now it's usually in a
group format it's rarely a one-on-one
interview it's gonna usually be a group
interview so just be really prepped for
that the fact that it could be a group
interview okay so you got to interview
it's a group interview things that you
need to be bringing bring a model
they're going to ask you to bring a
model
bring your resume of course just Eugenia
how that out with you at all times
have your resume looking real time clean
brushes if you are going to be doing a
interview and a makeup application
interview
same day bring clean brushes they are
not going to provide you with clean
brushes you're going to need to bring
your own it doesn't matter does not have
to be Mac they can be that can be
Sephora that can be elf it doesn't even
matter like just bring your own brushes
okay it make sure they're clean like
crystal clean and clear water of the
ocean blue Hawaii clean okay
all black attire of course business
casual stick to like the more business
casual I think you just look a lot more
professional
just black attire fresh as the makeup is
a bullet on my fresh ass make up going
with fresh ass mica preferably
it would be mac makeup like because ah
and my interview they act the girl they
were like um so I love your makeup like
what are you wearing from us and she was
like doubtful on a wrinkled edge from
you
okay so just in case they would ask you
like how cool it is that what lipstick
are you wearing like let it be like
please let it be back like it let's just
say like oh you know it's like crying no
that's not gonna fly bitch that's not
gonna fly make sure you're wearing at
least something of Mac and just in case
they ask ok the group interview is first
I know is good interview is gonna go out
any group interview would go basically
you're trying to out impress the other
bitch next to you I know that it's like
you probably make friends there by the
end of the day you're trying to out
impress that meet a message okay there's
a room that my number one most like
advice for this group interview is
always raise your hand first and I'm
talking like I know I know the answer
like I'm talking like be extroverted
when it comes to you raising your hand
even if you don't know the answer raise
your hand first like I'm telling you
like it's gonna make a huge difference
if they think like oh my god this but
you know everything like they're not
gonna call you every time they're not
yummy but I should have your hand raised
and even if they did call you if they're
like okay cool so that it uh anyways you
know you don't know yet you can be like
well the reason of this because we have
a couple seconds to think of the answer
just reiterate the question girl be
smart about right so even if you don't
know the answer raise your hand at all
times and always be first be that bitch
okay be that like kiss ass bitch
cuz it don't matter if anyone thinking
later cuz that's bitch because you're
gonna get the job in the room huh okay
darling so I wrote down be bubbly be
attentive be extroverted and be
confident with your inner
I mean of course that that's not your
kind of personality if you're not
extroverted if you're not bubbly if
you're not happy and you're not like
kind of like crazy and spastic like how
I hit like I'm crazy effects tick and I
mean honestly I would just say fake it
till you make it like you don't have to
necessarily be like I sex referred it or
and hit that but you just you want to be
a presence in the interview room you
want to be like known you want to be
seen and that's what's gonna be the most
important thing so even if you're kind
of introverted and shy try to break out
of that before you go into the interview
or when you're at the interview break
that real hard okay questions that
they will ask they will ask cosmetic
face questions and they will ask retail
basic questions I don't really remember
the questions that they were asking I'm
like they would be like okay so this is
a question at the counter was slow what
would you do to build traffic so like
that's just something like a very easy
question I requested my first I said
that I would be making samples I'll be
going out to like the the hallways be
like oh hey come on in try try this
here's a sample of something that was
just that was my question they really
liked it um drive traffic through social
media there's a bunch of different
things that you could be saying that's
the type of question that they will ask
they want to know that you'll be able to
answer a question based off cosmetic or
retail experience if you do not have
cosmetic or retail experience that could
be a real big problem girl okay um it
will be I'm not gonna lie it will be
hard for you to get hired and back if
you do not have retail and cosmetic
experience or either or
I mean Mac is a company like they want
to know that you can sell their product
and that you'll be able to sell it well
not only sell well now you'll be able to
know what you're talking about they want
to know that you're a people person and
that you're not going to be mean to the
clients that's what they want to know
they want to know that they can trust
their brand name with you as type of
person you are
that's super super super important you
need to be able to know your hint and if
you don't have cosmetic or retail it's
great it's gonna be a little tough to be
low to rock and why if you don't good
luck but if you do that's the good side
so we got through the we got through the
group interview we're sweating cuz it's
really it was really hard no it's really
not that hard really easy actually
they're really nice um now the makeup
interview I have a lot I ever lock down
wrote down for this okay guys okay till
the makeup interview I'm just letting
you guys know right now be prepared for
them to switch your models on you the
model that you brought in you could have
practiced on her twenty times just like
if that makeup perfect but if the
interviewers think that you guys
who closed with the models or they want
they just want to do this they will be
like okay everyone switch models and
you're gonna do it a 30 minute
application on a different model it's
nerve-racking okay so just be prepared
for that like to look around to the
other model see their skin colors things
like that just so you can know what to
grab just case you do get switched so
just don't be too scared if it does
happen to you it's not that big a big
deal okay just be prepared for that like
you just need you need to be able to be
quick on your toes girl be quick okay so
you're going to have basically 30
minutes to do a full face makeup
application like they're for sure gonna
be like saying you have 30 minutes so my
suggestions for this 30 min application
grab products that are going to be a
multi-use for you and when I say that
I'm talking grab a bronzer that you can
use as a freaking eyeshadow like I'm
talking you have 30 minutes here you
need to make those 30 minutes count and
they will like time you like stop at the
30th minute and you better have that
full face done I'm talking full like
complexion eyes mascara lips everything
has to be done in 30 minutes okay that's
what I did like I grab for example when
I grab the bronze without use for mine I
use my bronzer and her crease I used the
highlighter I have on her cheek on her
eye on her eyelid like I'm talking like
I went no I was Berkeley when it came to
the things I use blush on no I just used
her blood on her blush just use products
um that will be great for multi-purpose
hopeful phone another thing to when
you're going to grab the product that
you're going to be using you want to
grab everything at one time I'm talking
like even if you have to like pull your
shirt up stuff that in there get
everything you can sometimes they'll
have baskets on the side so you can toss
everything that you need in a basket
grab your products get them all at one
time and go because it's gonna be hard
when you're having to keep pulling away
please just got all the products they
have at one time it's going to be much
more beneficial to you and I'm going to
pull away because you're just wasting
time okay so before the interview even
starts this is the great part about the
interview you have to basically pretend
that you have no idea who your client is
like even if it's the person that you
know like for example mine with my hand
I basically had to endure like I had to
interrogate her and ask more questions
about what she wants to do and I know
her about how to pretend like I didn't
know her okay as soon as they told you
they're gonna have 30 minutes they're
gonna give you a scenario on what to do
for example my scenario was it's a it
was a businesswoman who doesn't really
wear um
that much makeup each one skater makeup
done for a little like party at
nighttime so she's not used to wearing
makeup which she wants to do a little
party she's wanna have her makeup done
for a party so she still wants it to be
glam but she just want it to be heavy
so that was my scenario okay so like
they will give you a scenario to work
with cool you're going to want to
interrogate the client and when I mean
interrogate the client I'm talking
awesome questions about their skin about
what kind of makeup they want to do
things like that this is really
important I know it's gonna be weird
because you if you're going to be doing
the application on the model that you
brought you're gonna usually know the
person they're gonna be your friend you
can be a family member and see me kind
of weird because you basically written
that you don't know who they are at all
so just be pretty intimate gay that I'm
talking like okay so like hi like next
week you can introduce yourself so tell
me what kind of skin do you have to have
oily skin you have dry skin Jeff combo
skin that's going to give you some
questions on like what to be using the
products that Mac has that she needs to
take be taken care of ask them ok cool
what are you gonna be doing tonight like
what's the van for it's not a great
question um even though we already know
the scenario basically you're
role-playing throughout the entire
interview because you don't know where
they are ask them questions about their
live ask them how they're doing cetera
et cetera another good thing to do is
tell them about the oh my god that's
really scared me as a bird that flew by
it
woo the social responsibilities of Mac
you know what I mean make it very very
very comfortable do they want max want
to know that you're gonna be comfortable
to client okay be super super hygienic
I'm talking like super high genic I work
from exo I know the hygienic processes
okay so for example let's do a little
example everything that you use is gonna
be on a tissue
I'm talking about like they have to
shoot everywhere lay down to to Peyser
tissue be repaired you might not have a
lot of space like talking like I had
that maybe that much space for
everything I needed that is not a lot of
space so be prepared that you might have
a lot of space put down tissue anything
that you're going to be using have it on
the tissue weeks for hygienic reasons
Mac just wants it to be as hygienic as
possible so do that when using a
powdered product for example I have
Studio Fix right here before you go in
with to the product that is dirty you're
going to grab a tissue
something like this I'm just s what I
have next to me you're gonna wipe the
first layer off and you dip your brush
right into the product okay if it's
powder cool and then you can use it as
many times as you want you can dip right
back in it doesn't matter as long as you
have that first layer off because
bacteria doesn't seep through
outer like it would in the cream if
you're using cream product what you can
want to do is you're going to want to
scrape the first layer off the cream and
you can get a applicator pretend this is
an applicator and for example concealer
eye concealer right here you're going to
want to clean the first layer dip the
applicator into it scoop out a little
scoop and put it on a tray or a peachy
dish that they will be providing for you
you do not want to dip into a cream
product multiple times you want to make
sure it's as hygienic as you can
possibly make it because it's gross if
you're using nasty shaped okay so just
be as hygienic as you possibly can be
when you're doing the application for
the makeup make sure that you are
walking them through the process I'm
talking about like Mac has mirrors
everywhere they want to know that you
can be able to walk a client through a
consultation
so again interaction like this really an
example okay great so I'm actually have
you hold them here so they can kind of
see the what I'm doing on the eyes so
that you can learn and do it your own
home so they're gonna you're gonna have
the mirror in that person's hand and
you're gonna be doing the makeup on them
and you're gonna be explaining the
entire time while you're doing what
for example I'm applying contour right
here because then you go to lift
cheekbone appearance and basically just
gonna explain to them what you're doing
and let them watch you doing it because
it's basically you showing and telling
and teaching the client what to do okay
that's a huge thing with Mac is showing
and telling I know wedding I know I'm
doing really good at that something I've
been really good next page comes done
guys well done okay we got through the
whole interview we're done with it we
did the whole application 30 minutes one
by done you stop put everything down
your applications on shows good you're
good to go just letting you guys know
that right now they will be walking
around your application the entire time
listening to what you are saying to the
client that's why it's so important to
be talking to them about Matt about what
you're doing to them etc etc okay so
it's really really important as soon to
30 minutes and they will be walking
around and they will gonna be they're
gonna be asking you okay so why did you
do this why did you decide put this here
they're gonna ask your client Oh what
did you learn today that is what I'm
saying show and teach teach them what to
do okay they're gonna because they will
ask maybe not 107 1000-watt but they're
gonna want to know like did the client
learned something today like did they
are they gonna be able to take a product
home and be able to use it themselves
that's really important you don't I mean
that's really important to Mac they want
you to know like what you're doing and
they want to know like Lionel what
they're doing to so they're gonna go
around after they ask you those
questions there
say I'm just gonna critique you a little
bit so most of the time they'll critique
you on what you did that could have been
a little bit better okay
for example one of my eyes was blended a
little bit higher than the other one I
did a red lipstick on my clients so the
lying on the bottom area wasn't as
cleanly as it should have been and it's
red so it has to be really really clean
so they're just things like that it was
really too bad for me you know I mean so
just be prepared to answer their
questions that they're gonna ask you
like quick cool so now Energy's done
they critiqued you they're gonna say
okay everyone can go now
so what you want to do what I did is
that I went ahead and I left my resume
one more time because I brought two
extras them came and I hand shook every
single person that was interviewing us I
henchard them said thank you so much
proper tuning to be here can we do hear
from you guys again etc etc now that
you're gone
you had your interview you're feeling
really good it was really crazy
basically if they tell you this will
happen they told us not to call them
that that they would call us that they
were interested in us okay so be listen
to what they are saying if they say we
are really busy we will be calling you
do not close don't call them you guys
like do not call them they will be they
will call you they're interested I
promise you okay they told us that
they'd be calling us within two weeks
okay two weeks they didn't call me for a
month in six days I kept track of it
because I wanted to know so just be
prepared for that if even if it couple
weeks have gone by don't be too
discouraged yet they could just be
really really busy that's how it was for
us like they were opening new counters
in San Diego so they got super super
busy and super swamped and so that's why
it took a while to call us but I didn't
call I was like okay you want to be fine
other that like they'll call me if
they're interested and I was free I was
sweating bullets trust me I wanted to
know if I got it
turns out that I did and they called me
they offered me a freelance position
most of the time nowadays you will be
offered a freelance position over a
permanent position unless like by some
miracle that you became permanent right
away as an artist which is pretty hard
to do but they offer your finance
position I took it I'm not going to be
talking about the pay and I'll be
talking about that stuff cuz that's not
appropriate but I took the position and
I put my two weeks in my old job which
was at Sephora and yeah I love I love
working for Mac like now I'm just I'm
super happy being a freelancer I get to
make my own schedule I get a calling
when I need hour
and there's not too many boys in San
Diego freelancers so it's not like too
too hard from you to like hell at work
you know what I mean because they like
diversity like I was saying before and
um yeah Mac has been great to me like
it's such a great company and I look
forward to working with them more as a
freelancer I'm not going to pursue being
permanent with Mac because of other
