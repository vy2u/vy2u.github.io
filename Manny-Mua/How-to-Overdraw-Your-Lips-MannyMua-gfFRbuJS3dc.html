channel today's video is going to be one
of my most requested videos I get like
total it's definitely this one one of
the most requested of all which is going
to be how I overdrawn how I lip line my
lips before we actually get started I
just wanna let you guys know lip lining
is very personal it's very different
it's going to look different uncaps
lutely everyone mic tips and tricks
could possibly not work for you and it
could be look they can look a little bit
different on you so usually want to be
careful with that kind of thing okay so
when you're looking at my lips look at
my lips so so my lips look like so I
have very rosy very pinky lips and this
isn't with me going over um but my
foundation brush is a little swipe of
foundation so what my lips look like
what I do personally with my lid is I
over line the top a lot more than or
line the bottom when you're looking at
my lips when you look at your own lips
you need to really decide which lip do I
want to accentuate more or which you
want to emphasize less so when looking
at my lips I'm looking at them I have
more fullness on the bottom so I want to
make it look like I have more fullness
towards the top also what you can see is
that my lip line on the top is not that
defined that's a huge huge huge thing
with lip lining if you're the type of
person has extremely extremely defined
lip line it's gonna be a little bit more
tougher to pull off I'm gonna send you
guys on there right now
the reason I can pull it off or I feel
like I can pull it off is because my lip
line is not that defined so that's a
huge huge huge part of it so we're gonna
do we're gonna grab your lip liner of
choice I'm using the peekaboo neutral
lip liner by NYX Cosmetics it's my
favorite lip liner of all time it's just
absolutely perfect for me and the reason
I love it so much is because it's a DP
pink brown color and that works really
great with my lips because it kind of
fools people to thinking that that's my
actual lip line I mean not really you
guys know I ever draw but it really
helps um create annual the point when
it's a little bit darker than your own
lip color and that's why for me the next
p-goon intro works so so so so good I'll
show you guys right now how I like this
start as I start out to keep it the bone
right here for me I'm right-handed so I
always like to start on the right I just
feel like it feels more natural to me so
what I do is I created my little mark so
I want to start and then so you see
right here this like my Cupid's bow is
not
find I don't have a defined upper lip
right here at all so I like to really
define it so I'll go over my lip line
and I'm going barely barely over my lip
line okay
towards the front I like to go a little
bit more ham and heavy with the lip line
towards the center and then I'm some
going downwards I go barely over the lip
line not on top of it just barely over
it so you can I'll do one side so you
can see what I'm talking about
probably rinse look it's fast mode see
that that's the cool thing about using
this lip liner for me this is why people
always ask me like why is next lip liner
your favorite and peekaboo neutral this
is why it's the perfect shade for me in
my lip tone and I feel like a confidence
my lip color the most it looks so
similar just a little bit darker in tone
and that's why I use it for literally
every single color besides dark and like
red that's I use it for everything else
so as you can see right here this side
is much more defined it's a lot more
full than this side so right here is
when I lift my lip line is naturally
right here so I went over it right above
it and as I'm going down I go towards
the actual lip line a little bit more
okay same thing on the other side
when you're starting to overdraw for the
first time it takes practice like it's
not one of those things words like I
know how to overdraw now mm-hmm I go
first time you try you know I mean takes
practice for your first time so this is
what my lips look like now I like them
to look a lot more full on the top and a
little bit less full on the bottom so
then I'll just kind of go in and fill in
from the bottom
I like to overdraw a little bit from the
bottom as well so you can see right here
starting in the center the bottom like
to keep much more close to the actual
lip line and another reason why I like
this lip liner for myself is because
it's matte and the great thing about
matte lipstick is like it's going to
help disguise the natural lip line of
your lips because obviously because
that's a natural lip line it's going to
catch light a lot easier because it's an
actual divot in your lips so when using
a matte it's going to really help not
emphasize your natural lip line if that
makes sense so then let's go on with the
matte lipstick as well so we're going to
go in with Gerlach take lip paint in
starlet which has been one of my
favorite lip paints but like lip
anything for a while to lick lipstick
I've been loving it recently so I
personally go over I'm going to
basically draw in the lines and go right
up to your lip line and make sure to
cover your actual natural lip line with
this so it turns matte kind of little
too much on the sides only fine this is
the great part about lip lining first is
that you have a nice guide make sure you
really want to just get every single
spot every crevice even the corners of
the mouth you want to get as well and
let that dry and now we're over light
like quickly that is how you live line
yo William ain't that hard huh this is
the way I the point it to be different
for everyone
if you have a very very very very
defined lip line you can't really look
line how I do because my lips aren't as
defined so you really just need to focus
on your actual lip and really just kind
of see like what's it work great for
your lip this is what works great for
mine or at least what I like to do okay
