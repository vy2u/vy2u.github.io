as you guys know from the title of this
video
today's video is gonna be all about how
to apply lashes and it 20 because
today's video was not supposed to be
this hopefully this will work but that's
why I need I need to speak to this bitch
because my external isn't working right
now my external hard drive and I'm like
so because I'm gonna be an ally
for the next three days and tomorrow
morning have to go get a repaired and so
it's gonna be a minute it's a mess I'm
so on right now it's 11 o'clock at night
and I'm trying to record hopefully it's
not too long so that my laptop will be
able to download the because it's
kind of full it's hella four so I mean
without further ado let's just get this
bitch started because this what its
gonna be if you don't get off a kabocha
you know the you know what that
pressings first we're gonna get a pair
of lashes today I'm just going to be
using the I wear lashes let's just blow
my mouth up and so first things first
when you're applying false lashes when
you get the lash you're usually going to
come in like this something like they're
gonna be situated in there like what the
glue how you want to pull them off is
you want to use anything use your thumb
at the backing of the band lift it and
it pulls out so you have to worry about
trying to get from the ends right at
that just lifts really roughly from the
big right there pull downwards and it
pulls up pulls off the band it pulls off
the glue that's a great way to take off
your lashes if you a lot of people don't
know that I do it out map call the town
on there so that's why you cannot do
first and so you're gonna take out the
little lash whatever it looks like and
you're gonna put it against your eye
you're gonna measure exactly how long
the band is with how long your eyelid is
you want to make sure that's not too far
inwards bothering your inner eye but
it's not too far out where it's hanging
at the end just depends on your eye
shape okay whatever your eye shape is
follow that make sure it's not hanging
at the end if it does what you're going
to do is get loop pair scissors oh my
god
 pigs in half I did nice
I was like my favorite pairs didn't
either meet you know what we're gonna go
effect we're just going to go with it
what you're going to do is you're going
to trim the end of the scissors you
always want to trim at the end because
you leave the front it's going to be a
little more it's going to be a little
bit more like tapered and just kind of
like fitting your eye shape towards the
front of your eye better so you're
watching that ends always so we're going
to do after they're trimmed you want to
get the ends of the lash and just got do
this
roll them roll the bad boys roll the
band and so they're kind of like more
eye friendly shape when they're in the
packaging it's not the most I finally
shape I'm just letting this door right
now
they're been kind of weird or the bed
like this we want them to be as kind
like this well they would be curved in
so when you place it it snags at the end
of your eye without making thing bit
plus we want to do so yeah the lashes
are curled they are trimmed and they are
ready it's all gone so we want to do
with your own honey did you get a pair
any pair of chrome crater lashes try to
get as close to the base as possible
what I like to tell people is just look
down into a mirror and curl and pulse
for like five seconds so basically what
you want to do is you want the curl to
hold up your lashes and support the
falsies make sure you get a good old
curl in the arm it's good enough and
then you're gonna pipe apply a quick
tiny coat of mascara nothing too crazy
you just want them to be a little bit
darker because you want them to blend in
with the falsies a little bit better you
know what I mean so put any cook but my
skirt you wanna find just one coat okay
just one cook for me and then you're
gonna get your eyelashes put a quick
coat of do or whatever lash glue you
want to apply to it you apply a quick
small layer of it and let it dry for a
good thirty seconds okay I let this dry
from the but good thirty Seconds now and
what you want to do is look down into a
mirror use a tweezer so I do use a
tweezer looking down press the center of
the lashes into the center of your
eyelid this is a huge tip and then what
we're going to do tweezers because it's
as close as we want it to be to the lash
line right now you want to go from the
side of the ADI
and we really just pull it and press it
in this is the best part about having
duo that's a little bit dry because it
will stick right away it will not move
anywhere you need to wait 30 seconds
wait that 30 but then you're
going to apply at the sides or here and
then you'll do the front part looking
down still get with the tweezer and
press in front sight what I also like to
do sometimes is I'll press in my real
lashes into the false ease with the
tweezers just to mask them a little bit
better like that and that is how you
apply a false lash I'm just
gonna do one I mean I don't have enough
space in my laptop you wanna fit
multiple things so I'm just gonna do one
eye look at that already open up my eyes
so much yeah doc I'm gonna go and just
do the other side real quick and then
I'll be right back boom got both lashes
on I think they look a lot cuter if I
had liner on but for the purpose of this
tutorial
liner isn't enough going on come on no
time I don't get that time for the liner
shade though I'm at the end of it I just
kind of like to bat my eyelash into the
falsies just make sure that they're
really lifted look I'm really proud that
was the video hope you guys learned
something and you guys learned and you
took from my way of teaching you know to
doing it and it's honestly it's not hard
it's all about just practicing learning
doing the steps like taking out the
lashes bending them trimming them if you
have to applying with tweezers to the
center of the lid using the outside of
it put that bitch into your lashes just
put fundation layer oh yeah if you guys
just follow the steps
practice practice makes perfect and hope
