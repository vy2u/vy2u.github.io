and I have makeup on still so I'm like
why don't I just record a video
okay there I makeup on let's not waste
that opportunity first me powder my face
I'm almost looking real glowy this
brought rain oh you go done so as
you guys can see from the title this
video isn't beyond how to do winged
liner like a badass be so me to
talk to video on how to do this one
side we're gonna do one method another
side we do another method so if you want
to see how I'm doing these winged liners
keep watching and you don't like you
don't watch it double this we do
it this video better not be too long
because I swear how long can they forget
they do a winged liner where you'll be
almost bloopers full domain II my
allergies are so bad right now so I have
these black eye circles oh I
swear they're so terrible or Smith it is
we're gonna be using a small tiny pencil
brush and a liquid liner and that's how
we're gonna sell we're gonna do this
side this one is the makeup geek vent
liner brush I really love this brush
because has a really thin end and I love
that so first we're gonna start off
with our winged liner starting from the
bottom of the lash line we're gonna tilt
upwards
we're gonna fall basically the bottom of
our last night all the way up to as if
our brow and our bottom or lash line
work that have like a little party right
here that's what we're gonna aim for is
that they meet at this point over here
but every single time you follow your
natural lash line when doing winged
liner you should have equal winged liner
every single time
as long as you're following your neck
jaw shape cool its first we're gonna
deposit the melt right here first
I just like top deposit on the middle
first because I never know how much is
on the brush and then from the bottom
okay
again bottom lash line we're gonna
lightly flick upwards
and just flick flick that just like
flicking and then you're gonna drag
boom see that you're gonna drag the
line net from a point right here this
plate right there basically where it's
about to start getting more bold Missy
oh my god does that mean a word
and then just going to fill in the
lashline with whatever you got left
school filled in here
I'd like to follow my natural lashes
like this Wow I'm really impressed with
this brush right now and it's freaking
cheap - don't worry I'll leave the link
to it in the bottom cool so we have that
look at that boom winged liner super
easy wind now let's do the other side
different method basically by different
that means from brush and different
we're gonna be using a gel liner on this
side and a angled brush to apply it
having these this wing Ahola it's the
morphe gel liner mm-hmm Oh looks kinda
black I elite okay you're gonna
be using on this side managed to turn my
body huh we're gonna be using a the
Anastacio number seven brush which is
this really thin liner brush you see
these pimples cuz I have highlighter on
you can see them even more full cuticles
where's gonna load the brush it's so
creamy get creamy cream oh so for me my
shameful
hey guys basically we're in do the same
exact thing you're gonna be following
that same line this invisible line here
going outwards so we're gonna start this
one same thing I like that gonna start
right here
I like this lighter and we're gonna
follow the bottom of the lash line going
outwards okay
and flick boom connect
and fill in like it's a party
you only
so obviously they're uneven
they're pretty uneven I'm not gonna lie
but I'm a fan using liquid liner over
gel liner that's just personal
preference um if I can just I can just
get a sharper line with liquid and it's
just easier for me I don't know why I
just damn like that now if you want this
part is optional you can clean the
bottom of the liner with some foundation
clean it on up
you want to be really sharp this liner
is basically saying man you're really
trying to teach them something and
you're down come on be it
oh wait woken up then I'm not perfect
you guys know this you know how I am you
know I don't give a you know I just
want to teach you guys how to do some
things even if it's not perfect
look at that I look like I'm not
crazy at the age let me lit out really
terrible hold on oh let me go equal this
 up those wings could cut a bitch I
swear to God I swear you don't mean
remember you got to always clean up the
bottom of the liner or whatever it with
the concealer or foundation and a small
little flat brush you can clean it if
it's not sharp as you want it basically
okay so yeah that's how to do winged
liner like a boss really anything just
follow it just follow your natural shape
follow following your natural eye shape
will work for you every single time
