today's an exciting video as you can see
from the title today's video is going to
be all about my collaboration with Oprah
cosmetics I'm doing three liquid
lipsticks with them they are live right
now so you guys want to pause the video
go buy the lipsticks do it pause it go
by the lippies user code menu anyway to
save you money first then buy the bees
but yeah today's video is gonna be all
about the liquid lipsticks that I did
with Oprah I'm so beyond excited to be
doing this collaboration huh it's been a
long time coming guys it has been a long
time coming working on this for a while
now it's so hard to keep these club
secret like uh just so freaking hard but
I actually love how they turned out
these are the three right here oh my god
this is not neutral heaven because if
it's not I don't know what is I'm
actually wearing one of the colors right
now I'm wearing Aries on the lips right
now in this video member he's watching
the lipsticks on my lips as well as my
hand just you can see the comparison and
difference between the swatches but
before I get started on that
as always we guys like this video if you
guys like me please don't watch
it you know the show that but sorry I'm
like in a really good mood today because
this is my video about Mike over
collaboration so you can't even
knock me down because I'm happy I'm a
happy bitch right now
so even if you do comment hateful
don't give a don't care but yeah if
you guys do like this video and you guys
do like me and you're excited for the
collaboration click like on this video
and let's get into it
okay great let's go and talk about the
collaboration the products and what not
so I climbed with offer Cosmetics like I
said again they are solely sold on line
on over cosmetics calm I believe each
lipstick retails for $19.99 should you
what all the lipsticks go for but they
do give out codes for different
affiliates to save you guys 30% off it's
like 30% for most if not all the
affiliates I'm one of the affiliates and
it's 30% off for me and these lipsticks
will be sold as a bundle pack as well so
if you guys want to buy three lipsticks
all three of them areas have no hand
charmed they will be on sale for $50 so
you gotta say ten bucks and then on top
of that you get to use the nickel you
could like mani anyway for example you
guys say 30% on top of that so then you
get the three lipsticks for 35 bucks I
just think that's such an amazing
 do I'm just really happy about
the lipsticks you know I was really
happy about them like I feel like
they're not like charging you an arm and
a leg $35 for a bundle like that's great
to me so thank you guys I offer for
being so amazing to my followers let's
go ahead and dissect each color really
quickly don't talk about the one I'm
wearing currently this is the shade Ares
it is a beautiful soft baby pink peach
shade it's not too pink but it's not too
peachy the reason it's named Aries is
because hi Emmett Aries are born on
April 4th
I've studied such a perfect name for
this shade I love pinky peachy nude
colors that's like my go-to color so I
had to stop like Aries would be the
perfect name for this because this is
one of my teams of all time but I do
love the shade Aries so much and I hope
you guys try it out now the shade
charmed you guys mm-hmm this is gonna be
a favorite I can just feel it in my
bosom my chi chi's okay this
shade is a deep pinky Brown with the
hint of like Mavi purpleness to it it is
such a stunning freaking shade and
literally will work on like so many
different skin tones from like the
lightest all the way up to the darkest
complexions I think this one is really
one of those that will be a true
beautiful color on every skin tone I
just love it so so so ho much especially
cuz it has like so many mixed colors in
it brown pink purple mauve like it just
it's stunning and I think you guys will
love this one this I think this is gonna
be the one that's gonna be like gonna be
a bitch to get cuz this is like a
good-ass color I named it charmed after
the show charmed I was up
best what I say that I was obsessed I
mean how I was obsessed with the show
charmed when I was younger I watched
every single episode I've seen it
several times I see the whole season
several times it is such an amazing show
and it took place like in the 90s and
this shade just kinda reminds you the
90s as well so it's a mixture I've one
of my favorite childhood shows charmed
which is like just mmm so good and the
90s kind of a lip shades so that is what
charmed is and I hope you guys like the
shade and last but definitely definitely
not least is the shade
hypno this is a beautiful dark brick red
color it is stunning it's stunning
like I'm done it definitely is a mixture
of brown purple and red it's such a
beautiful British dark burgundy color I
absolutely love the shades so much I
named it hypno because it just is like I
don't know when you wear dark colors
with that I always whenever I see it is
very hypnotizing and I whatever I see is
someone in a dark lip I'm just like
staring at them so I'm like you brave
ass bitch you are wearing a dark
lip right now like and it looks good
that's how I wanted a name hip no hip no
because I just feel like it's such a
cool badass name for such a cool badass
color I love it this shade is gonna work
on every single skin tone I'm not
kidding you this is a beautiful shade
from like the fairest widest skin to the
darker soft complexion it is gonna be
spending on you because it does have so
much dimension to the lip I just think
this is such a great color and if you
guys want to get a really nice brick
dark color I would definitely send a
manned one p.m. Eastern Standard Time
I think this cloud is such an amazing
collaboration and I'm so happy to be
doing this at the time I am because you
guys know I just released the men EMU
and make a deep palette recently and
that I hit the freaking Beauty community
hard in the paint and we haven't been
able to keep it in stock it's like still
on pre-order right now so I'm really
really happy to able to put out
something that we will have stock of and
something you guys can purchase and just
be part it's like part of me with you
guys and I really do hope you guys like
these colors I know tons of people will
be like oh my god there's the stain
colors I've seen all over the place but
I don't care these are my colors you
know these are this is my collaboration
these are like my heart and soul these
are the colors that like speak to me and
it's my collab
the yellow and green haha so if you are
that person to be like I've seen those
clothes everywhere I'm not buying it
that's fine you don't need to buy it at
all but you don't need to tell me and
you'll need to be a bitch to me because
you don't like it so I just want to say
thank you so much Oprah for the
opportunity to do this collaboration
it's been such an amazing experience
this is my fourth liquid lipstick
collaboration I would have to
create my own brand because this is
getting ridiculous and honnestly like
this is for you guys you know like I
only think about products that I
absolutely love and products that I
would only want you guys to love is well
I would never put out a product I don't
love and support 100% you know what I
mean so never forget that you guys oh
never put my name on something that's
not like gorgeous and that's not add up
to my standards because I feel like I
have high standards being on YouTube and
being a beauty person like on YouTube
you try so many different products and
you have such high standards that's the
cool thing about people clapping with
brands because they know good quality
and I feel like both are liquid
lipsticks are amazing quality and Queen

packaging photo for liquid lipsticks -
stepping up their stepping it up I
just wanted to say like thank you guys
