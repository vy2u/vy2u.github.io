welcome back to my channel thank you so
much for being here I was so excited
Jesus a little nervous which is fine I'm
nervous too I've never done anything
like this I remember like prom was like
such an intense time for me and I was so
nervous right then and I remember like
not knowing like anything I'm like you
know I would I think it'd be really cool
if I can like make it easier for someone
like you to make your prom like just
experience a little bit easier be able
to glam you get your hair done get your
dress the dress is like amazing we're
basically going to be doing an entire
prom a transformation on you I'm so I'm
like just really excited to see you like
in full makeup backstory I posted on
Instagram I want to find a follower of
mine that lives in the Southern
California area who would be down for me
to glam them and to maybe go to prom
with them so you actually my boyfriend
so I'm not going to prom with you but
also we had like a bunch of schools that
we like reached out to and none of the
schools actually said that I could go to
prom with him because I am older and so
sadly I couldn't actually do the part
where I'm actually wanted prom so I
wanted to make it still special and like
go buy prom dress with you and still
glad I mean get her done things like
that so that was the original plan
couldn't happen but it's all good
because we have you know we were
prepared we came prepared everything is
totally fine and it's gonna be great and
I'm so excited and say I already get
right into the today's video thank you
so much to two-face for parting with me
in today's video and wanting to be part
of this with me they donated so much
stuff and you're gonna get to take home
like literally everything so I'm so
excited yeah yeah let's get right into
today's video let's get it we're gonna
take V hangover RX
which is amazing by Too Faced and we're
gonna play that with a meal inner you
were telling you that your skin is
mostly dry but oily someone
zone right you're saying yeah so we're
gonna go ahead just do a primer that's
just nourishing but still keeps the
makeup on a little bit longer so I feel
like that would be the hangover RX it's
perfect for it so what do you think how
does it feel like being in like a beauty
room being this and this really yeah
crazy he's like I've seen like this
background so many like yeah it's fun to
see what's like actually on your table
and yeah is it not like so much like
overwhelmingly a lot you're like if I
had good guy good man so you're actually
deceptively light I swear to God I
thought you're gonna be a little bit
lighter so it's gonna kind of build from
here and we'll see how we go yeah cuz
we're gonna bronze you have don't even
worry about it but I know exactly I
remember when I first put honey so I was
like is this even me like I was like so
sure with different complexions right
like you have like different shades in
different areas so for example your
cheek is like light but your forehead is
like deep but look like light your legs
like you're actually a really fair you
want to like match your body in a way
guys wanna but can see you on you and
this is just like it's like a pinky
peachy shade just cuz that helps like
brain everything up but have you got any
makeup done before by a few friends yeah
yeah never like this
got it got like this like in this
situation totally no it's like sleeper
that's super cute and then that like I
love it because I feel like you're doing
so well like you're not reacting like in
a bad way to me but I feel like I laughs
you were like like they're like freaking
out I'm putting it on them and I'm like
girl have you ever in your life needs
like oh yeah when I did me good like
back in like when I worked at like
Sephora oh sorry I'm just not used to it
it might really no let's do some of my
favorites any color of all time to face
more on this you're gonna literally fall
in love with this batter
I mean if you ever wear powder I promise
you what are you like the most excited
about for problem probably like seeing
everyone else's dresses and like say my
friends like Donna yeah that's like the
most the most fun thing everyone like
glammed up and like you've done up
really well but it's not even like just
like the girlfriend throats like at the
dudes to like seeing everyone dressed
like everyone look look so handsome ur
so pretty I miss prom it I feel like if
I could go back and change things up
like I would does I feel like I would I
go to prom again but I feel like I would
be so much more confident in myself I
wish I was like how him now in high
school but I wasn't it was super shy
ready and you not a concealer Brown
doing your makeup race here yeah I was
born in Chula Vista like San Diego like

you been watching all these people do -
like in general I'm not watching it
since I was like 9 came out yeah it's
like for a while yeah well I feel like
makeup guru I don't know where it
literally did like it just got so big
yeah yeah I started watching it it
doesn't seem like the makeup community
just like grew overnight yeah it's the
weirdest thing and I do want an odyssey
Jun why I think it is I think because
there was so many people that came on
the internet that were being so like
authentically themselves like I feel
like that really is what like helped the
beauty community I think one people like
like me like Geoffrey and like Patrick
and like Laura and Nikita like people
that are authentically themselves and
just kind of shoving their true selves
online yeah different kinds of like
personalities uh-huh like I started
doing makeup - that's what made of fun
oh she's getting some color in her and
I'm living ooh do you like it so far
yeah okay go no where's a must a date
that looks super pretty on you because
like a deeper color it's not like so
light it is soft like just a little kiss
