so as you guys can see after the channel
today's video today's video is going to
be a little bit different I've been
wanting to make this video for such a
long time but I haven't really had the
courage to create it I just like it's
time you know I feel like with this
situation I feel like it's kind of been
like it's like been like me in the
closet you know like when I was like 16
years old and I wanted to get out so bad
and I wanted to talk about things so
badly but I didn't watch because I
wasn't confident enough at the time I
feel like I've been in the closet with
this and I feel like it's like I've been
a weight on my chest and I just I don't
want to hide it anymore I'm so tired of
hiding things I just wanna be super
honest and I want to be honest with
myself and honest with you guys and yeah
that's just what it is as you can see if
the title um I have vitiligo your white
blood cells attack the melanin in your
skin and creates white patches and white
spots all over your skin only area I can
really show you guys is right here on my
hand um as you can see a little spots
here and right here by my fingers and
the pigmentation by my fingers there is
gone it's kind of hard to tell on my
hand so yeah today's video is going to
be um they see it's almost like a
diaries like a journal of my experience
having a bit of Lego and how I'm coping
with it currently and what I'm gonna do
about it I guess I don't know I'm just
this is a video I wanted to just come
clean and talk about this because it's
been on my mind so much and I think
about it every single day and it's been
such a frustrating thing for me that I
want to just come clean about it and say
it like yeah I have a lego get over it I
need to get over it you know there's so
many worse things in the world as always
if you guys like this video you guys
like me please don't fucking watch it
especially this kind of video because
this has to do solely with me me as a
person in my insecurities and things
that I have to deal with so I would
appreciate if you guys don't like me
please just do not watch this video do
not comment keep your comments to
yourself to a joint channel like this
video if you want or not it's all it's
all good I just say in every video
um but yeah let's go
so what is melago vitiligo is a skin
condition in which the white blood cells
in your blood attack melanin I'm
thinking that's a foreign object or
foreign substance and it attacks it
basically kills the color in your skin
creating white patches and that is what
the title is you're not going to die
from it it's just a skin condition it's
an autoimmune condition that
surprisingly a lot of people actually
have it's so crazy like this so many
people I do have this condition but it's
hidden they don't ever talk about it
it's like an embarrassing thing for them
and I understand because I do have it
and I get embarrassed when I spot
sometimes so I have it on my hands as
you can see there's like some spots here
like a spot right there
some spots about my fingers I have two
spots here one right here one right here
um all my fingers I have it basically
the areas around my fingers have no
pigmentation now can I see Rick right
there it's like white like a white
little strip yeah that's the middle I go
in my hands I have someone my hips I
have some in other areas I don't want it
at all but um I have it and I've just
been wanting to come clean about it for
so long I've been diagnosed for about a
year now it's been really hard you know
it's been really really really hard
coming to terms with it you know it's
not something I was born with it's
something that just came up it just came
on like randomly all of a sudden I
noticed a spot and I was like this is so
weird like white I have this little spot
that has no pigment and then it's
already growing and it started spreading
and I had no pigmentation there and I
was like what the fuck so I went to
doctor and he diagnosed me with vitiligo
and that I was probably gonna spread and
go to different areas of my body and so
I do have in different areas of my body
right now I don't have it in just one
spot I actually have one underneath my
chin like right here I have a spot but I
makeup on so you can't really tell and I
want to make this video because it's
like I'm just so tired of hiding it I'm
so tired of being a victim of this
ailment it's so fucking frustrating and
this disease and I'm so tired of hiding
it and it's like I don't have really
really the darkest complexion so it's
not like I have to worry about a very
intense high contrast I've been really
lucky with with this with this ailment
that I have this disease I don't want
like randomly like one day I wake up and
there's a spot on my face and you guys
like what the fuck there's something on
your face like you're missing pigment
and it's like yeah I know I have
vitiligo
but you guys didn't know that so I've
been wanting to make this video for such
a long time
I just been so scared I saw something I
want to talk about it's not something I
want to talk I just saw something I want
to own up to I do
want to accept it for so long I was like
no I don't have this like it's not it's
not I don't have it I'm not dealing with
this you know but I I do have it night
you have to deal with it in it's
embarrassing and it's so psychologically
draining and that's kind of why I wanted
to make this video because I've been
really lucky to see other people having
it like Winnie Harlow from America SEC
top model she's a African American model
who has vitiligo all over her body she's
absolutely beautiful and stunning and
she she's so empowered by her spots and
it makes her different and I just love
that there's other gaunt Instagram her
name is Lauren Elise and she also has
vitiligo and this is what she looks like
she has what I got on her hands on her
eyes different areas and seeing her
wearing makeup it's just like so
empowering to me I saw her and I
followed her right away and I was like
oh my gosh she's such a fucking badass
and she she just owns her spots and
she's just so she's so beautiful she's
so beautiful and it doesn't matter like
I'm getting to a point where it's like
you know what like if someone isn't
accept me for my spots and someone I
sent me for this then fuck em I don't
care and this applies to anything it
applies to everything and anything so
when I saw myself naked I was like so
embarrassed I was like no one's gonna
love me no wasn't love me because I have
you spots no one's I look like a freak I
look like a little Dalmatian or a cow or
something
or a panda you know and I was just so
embarrassed and I have a very light
complexion but I have color to my skin
it's like from color to white there's a
difference there's contrast and it's
psychologically so it was really rough
and I'm going to be working my hardest
to overcome this I'm not perfect and I'm
still struggling with it and I shall go
that literally every single day every
time I see a spot I get frustrated and
I'm hoping that as time progresses that
it's something that I can really own and
something that I can really say that's
part of me you know be proud of it and
being proud of my spots being proud of
being different like right now it's a
battle I've only had it for a year and
so it's been it's been really really
really really rough but I'm hoping that
me making this video if anyone out there
has similar ailments or has any other
skin condition that they're not happy
with or embarrassed by that they can
help me with how they cope with it they
can let me know what they did in order
to feel better about themselves um maybe
in a way like this is me handling my
problem and this is me like coming clean
about
me healing you know me making this video
is like a healing thing for me I needed
to make this so that I can not be scared
and not be like scared that if I'm
putting on primer with my finger and
someone's like what's that spot on your
hand it'll make I don't know you know
like I dunno it's by the Lego and I have
it and I have to deal with it if you
guys have similar ailments or you guys
are struggling I understand I totally
understand I hope that we one day can
overcome our insecurities about it and
I'm trying my hardest to even to this
day and I'm making this video and I'm
trying to be strong and try not to cry
about it cried about it enough I want
you guys to know that you guys aren't
alone if you guys do suffer from
something like this it really sucks
and we'll get through it you know I mean
it could be so much worse we cannot we
could there's so many worse diseases out
there you know like that's why I try to
think about it I strongly believe in the
fact that like God doesn't put things in
my way that I can't overcome and I can't
handle and if this is just another thing
that I have to get through then that's
fine and I'll get through it
um I'm a religious person I grew up
Mormon I don't really go to church
anymore but I am religious still and um
I do firmly believe that things don't
happen that you can't handle and that um
I'll overcome in it just like there's
not that many people that have this and
so it's just it I want more awareness
they brought to it like it's incurable I
can't cure it you know I've tried like
I've tried different methods I've done
like the whole like light therapy and
the topical treatments and everything
and it's not gone away it's a very real
disease it's a terrible disease it
really sucks but I'm gonna move on and
I'm gonna be fine and I'm gonna be okay
and I'm healthy and I'm very happy and
my family's healthy I'm just tired of
hiding and I'm tired of being scared of
people finding out because it's now it's
just a part of me I just like me being
gay it's not all of me but it is
something it's part of me sorry if this
video isn't very like fun or Abby or
anything I just needed to make this
because I needed I just needed to get
off my chest so hope you guys can
understand and I hope and I'm sorry that
this is like really sappy and sad and
you guys are like what the fuck but I
needed this I needed this to heal and I
feel like I can breathe like I can feel
like I can breathe easier now and like I
feel like now I'm gonna be making this
known it's like yes thank God like thank
God I can talk about it you know and
it's just another thing it's just
another thing that that's part of me so
yeah I just want to say thank you guys
for listening
and thank you guys for letting me be
open and thank you guys for all the love
and support I'm sure I'll be talking
about it a lot all on all my social
medias to come if things happen and
spots come up and areas that I didn't
want them to come up at thank you so
much for being there for me always I'm
trying to be there as much like air for
you guys and try to be as honest as I
can with you guys and just being just
being open and vulnerable and I feel
like vulnerability is such a beautiful
thing and when you're vulnerable you
take control of your life and you take
control of situations because you're
opening up yourself to situations and
you're controlling them and that's what
I'm trying to take control of my disease
and own up to it and like yeah I do
happen to like oh and I'm the fucking
still kill it I'm still gonna kill it
with my disease but yeah I love you guys
so much thank you for listening and I'll
see you guys very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
