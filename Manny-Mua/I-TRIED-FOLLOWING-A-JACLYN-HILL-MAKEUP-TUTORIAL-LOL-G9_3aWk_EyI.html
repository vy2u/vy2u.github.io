you guys say this video I am going to be
doing a full face trying to follow
someone's tutorial and have you guys see
a title I'm gonna be trying to follow
Jaclyn Hills tutorial the first person I
watched do this video was actually
Thomas Halbert here on YouTube he's
another beauty boy on YouTube which is
like so cool shoutouts to my Beauty boys
ki followed a Jeffrey star tutorial and
I was like oh my god this is such a fun
idea and I loved it I feel like I've
seen this capacitor on so so so much and
I actually asked you guys on Twitter who
you guys want to see me do a recreation
of I'm not kidding you when I say the
vast majority was Jacqueline Hill
everyone was like dude Jacqueline Hill
and I was like okay I'm like she's in
beauty world now don't I need to do a
little quick shout out to other people
that people were suggesting I had
someone do of course requesting me to do
Laura Gaby and Nikita of course had
somebody who asked me to do
Jeffrey star at so many people asked me
to do glam and gore Mikey here on
YouTube as well nikkietutorials simply
illogical etc except I had so many
Jackie hyena but by far the most was
Jacqueline O so I was like okay I'm
gonna pick Jaclyn hill I'm also gonna
link Thomas's Aboriginal video at down
below so you guys didn't see exactly
what I'm even talking about if you guys
don't even know what kind of trend
that's going on right now this is what
it is as always you guys if you guys
don't like this video if it's not like
me please don't watch it you
know the drill
with that but if you guys do like this
video please go ahead subscribe to my
channel if you're not already and if
you're new what's up I'm Annie anyway
welcome to my channel thank you so much
for being here
but yeah it's going to get into this
trying to follow along and Jacqueline
Hill tutorial
why decided to pull up the Jacqueline
Hill video where it's my radiant glow
foundation routine because I do not do
radiance foundation I don't do anything
like this is not like my thing I am
really really oily and she is more on
the drier side so she's really into like
glowy luminous perfect pretty like
foundation and I'm really into like
matte highlighting certain areas but
really matte foundation and I set my
whole face with powder translucent
powder so I thought this would be a
really really fun because it's something
I do not do normally cuz I feel like a
lot of the tutorials that Jaclyn does I
do a lot of those kind of similar things
too when it comes to like eye makeup and
things like that you know how I used to
watch Jacqueline back in the day so it's
like one of the things was like dude I
had to do Jacqueline - Jacqueline was
literally like the first beauty blogger
I swear I watched like I was obsessed Oh
Jacqueline I'm not gonna lie I mean I
live I live her and now of course but
we're friends now and it's like a
different like obsession obviously like
I was a huge huge fan back in the day so
I feel like it'll be really fun to do
this it was kind of an ode to Jacqueline
cuz she was one of the first blood tools
okay I can't pin my hair back because
obviously is what comes before you or
even touch your makeup on your skin
which is your skincare routine and your
skincare that you my agree underneath
but it's true you guys you guys really
need to focus on the prep of the skin
first Jacqueline I feel like is like the
best at doing this she's so good at
teaching why she doesn't think she does
and that's kind of why I want to do this
I'm gonna take the double Tintin she
uses this a lot so I'm gonna try this
out I don't know what she used today
because she doesn't family
I personally exploit in my skin four
days a week usually four times a week Oh
bitch pretty well it keeps away the
texture oh my god this is literally like
Chucky's okay we're starting we're
starting we're starting okay I have a
better stick okay colors but this is not
necessary for you guys to do at all it's
just right now I am kind of a very
strange in-between shade where I'm not
really like perfectly matching any one
color so I'm just kind of mixing a bunch
of them but please don't try this at
home
I'm trying to this at home oh oh we're
going with a white shade a bitch we need
to pause you hold on okay Jacqueline
went in with a really porcelain shade so
I'm gonna go in to really porcelain
shade and she did a cross on her
forehead she did one right here damn -
here she did one here right there with
the lightest ones and the normal ones on
the sides the foundation in the shade 21
this is a usually like my go-to shade
unless I'm really fair than I am shade
ten I'm gonna pump this on the back of
my hand just a few dots right there
never tried this before I'm gonna grab
my damp Beauty sponge any Beauty sponge
if you love the most will do you can use
a Beauty Blender a lot of people have
music bloggers - okay Beauty sponge mmm
I have a Real Techniques one no more for
you better let me pour a part and this
routine for me is grabbing a luminous
spray so I will you okay you're wealthy
it's fine
yeah well it's good right like this and
get that nice and wet I love pumping -
actually I love it flat side a sponge
and just pressing and pouncing it into
my skin it is the most satisfying
feeling in the entire world I can do it
for hours I've never thought I've never
sprayed with something doing and then
put it on my face never never I just
love watching all that unevenness and
all that redness and hyperpigmentation
doesn't just appear before my eyelids I
don't have any redness hyper - mutation
I'm perfect I'm a model so I don't
really know what Dr mean you know okay
I've never used the duo forever
foundation ever and the bitch looks
pretty I thought was gonna be too late
for me but it actually fits me pretty
nicely okay guys I pause Jacqueline so I
could finish up with the foundation but
honestly the skin is looking real good I
have mostly sparks all of them but most
I don't have like me
I have light neutral and then I have
medium so I'm just like nothing you're
really putting us through it huh
spray dead bitch wants to be real doing
okay how did you put my chuckling you
better hold on we've got more oh my word
my eyes if you guys feel like concealer
doesn't work for you
Oh their plan the eyelids - oh wait
we're pausing it we're pausing it she's
going too quick she's moving too fast
okay okay I get it though because I move
pretty quick on my tutorials - so this
is like such a normal thing for as like
a beauty blogger dude because you don't
want the actual videos to be too long
because I feel like people have like a
shorter attention span I'm gonna put it
on my actual nose I'm gonna put it up
here in the center I feel like this is
something I will never stop doing
highlighting the center of my face
it just makes such a difference like a
Sun like a Sun so much dimension and it
just really gives you that like like
sharp like Hollywood like Megan Fox look
I live I live I might be too light for
me like this is rough
absolute you know so make sure you get
in there with the pointy side my botox
is like completely worn off of my
forehead pretty much same same using on
my face so it is time to move on to
powder so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
go in with these Charlotte Tilbury
flawless finish airbrush powder and
shade number two right here and I'm also
going to be combining that with the
Lancome absolute powder this is why you
guys I do not have the Lancome powder
that is something I do not have but I
have basically almost everything else
I'm gonna take that side the beauty
sponge and just go right in and you can
see how much it picks up right off the
bat it picks up a generous amount and
then that and I'm gonna begin just to
press it into my skin very lightly
because I don't want to make myself like
matte as can be
she looks like so gentle doing it it's
literally like once again we are always
padding and we are always kind of
rolling and just mess oh my god I should
not be using Shea - oh my hold on you
guys where you think she'd one because
I'm bigger now
okay she'd one mm-hm
I'm more pouncing lightly Japan are for
it too right it's better for it to write
I deposit like I'm taking off so much
foundation doing this my tripping ok
under eyes now okay we got the pad we
got the shading light we had that here
she uses this shade all the time I mean
the bitch went in I went on here okay
we're using the same yeah we're really
Beautyblender get up okay hold on I'm
not they're trying to that girl okay
oh my goodness okay so we're setting it
with the pinky under-eye powder Oh bitch
this is definitely different than what I
do like I could already tell like with
the shape of my face like it's
definitely different but that's it right
we're just putting the pink powder
underneath here it looks so bright
though and I live actually living for
the bright under eye right now like whoa
she's a bright girl okay so I'm gonna go
do my brows my eyeshadow Jacqueline are
you kidding me you're not giving me your
shadow is that what you're gonna end it
you done pull the pageant on
this card you done pulled the bad you
guys okay I'll be right back I'm gonna
go do my brows in my eyes on her camera
and I'll be right back
okay we are now the eyes are done you
guys the faces on the lips are on okay
so I do not have this Lancome powder so
I pulled my lemare powder because I'm
like Jacqueline I have something linear
you too but anyway you guys the Lancome
powder actually is like has like a
luminous finish this is obviously not
the same guys it's not gonna have the
same effect as Jaclyn's i press it in
the more kind of melt into my skin and
doesn't give that white cast it just
becomes a beautiful radiant powder like
oh bitch that's like a glowing powder on
her Oh mine's definitely any more
luminous - Oh sick I don't have the
Stockholm one but Zilla Maryland's
pretty good and it wasn't me that dreads
warming in bug if I would have known
okay so we put delamare all over the
skin the lemare powder has a glowy
finish twitch I feel like this is gonna
quote be the closest thing I get to jock
lens without it being a highlighter so
this is a cool one title we got it's
matte but it's like glowy Matt what
if I do like some type of like what if I
get this powder and I mix it oh my god
with a glow powder my crazy okay so I'm
gonna go ahead and mix a little bit of
this Kylie Jenner Fiji glow powder this
really might be a really bad idea we'll
see I mean mix a little bit of this
powder this glow powder with a little
bit of the lemare glow powder to try to
see if we can get that effect that
Jacqueline has on her skin the literally
just looks like a luminous sitting
primer right well that's good pretty
glowy let's try it oh my gosh this might
be really better dear mm-hmm oh it's
good
Oh bitch it's giving me something this
is looking someone to my Jacqueline's so
much more mixing it with translucent
powder oh dude yes Jacqueline wanted to
glow all over the face so that's we're
gonna do okay so what we got you guys so
this is definitely much more like what
Jacqueline's looks like it has like a
globe to the skin but it's not obvious a
highlighter it's just like a glowy all
over the face glow okay you guys so I do
not have give me Sun bronzer but I do
have medium golden mineralized
skinfinish from Mac and I actually it's
like the same thing they're both
mineralized skinfinish Azure go ahead
and use this as our bronzer a lot of
people kind of gave up blush in 2017 but
no they didn't I love a good blush life
to the face and it's so necessary for me
okay we got some bronzer on us get some
blush
we're gonna get some bluish a blushing
bride nothing ham okay we're blushed
we're bronzed and now we're gonna take
some highlighter I do not have that NAR
spot that Jaclyn has so what we're gonna
do instead I don't know we're gonna
get another highlighter that we do have
what we're gonna do with the method that
Jacqueline suggests to do it so we're
gonna go ahead and take a highlighter
but we're gonna take it beyond I'm
really honest hacia highlighter take the
same sponge how do we do this how do we
do it
to just dab that and oh my god that's
skips if you want to smooth this
highlight the world use your beauty
sponge to apply it it makes such a
difference like a long time ago I used
to apply my highlight and then
afterwards I would go over and kind of
got it with a sponge but actually
initially going in and applying it with
a sponge it's just like a game-changer
Oh bitch applying with a sponge is kind
of everything holy spray it makes
your face super super glowy so if you
are oily you'll probably hate this cuz
it's kind of like oil in a bottle it
just makes you look
you have like that fresh glisten like
you just got done running on the beach I
don't know I'm obsessed with it but I
love to look like wet and sweaty the
truth oh my god I am glowing police okay
you're using a settings favorite
Jacqueline will take Tata we'll take
touch I don't have that how you really
been that betray no girl she's wearing
gloss I'm gonna put a gloss on okay
y'all so we completed the look this is a
falling Jacqueline's glowy skin from
within makeup LA and I definitely will
agree 1,000% that I've never been this
glowy in my entire life when it comes to
my routine look at my forehead
there's pebbles of glow and I've never
had that before but it looks beautiful
actually doesn't really really really
pretty I think this is a little too much
I'm not gonna lie this might be a bit
much let's go ahead and Pat that down
much much better okay much better oh my
god so this is it guys this is it for
reals like if I'm not doing from within
bitch I'm doing from without okay bitch
we are done with this video we are done
with this tutorial what do you all think
I think actually looks really pretty
actually really really do there's a lot
of steps we had to do we had a lot of
mixing a lot of we got a Dubonnet
say I think it turned out really really
really good I had so much fun doing this
video I think it looks beautiful the
skin looks really really nice well I do
this ever again no I will not because I
am more on the oily side this is just
something that I really want to try out
for fun because I was following
