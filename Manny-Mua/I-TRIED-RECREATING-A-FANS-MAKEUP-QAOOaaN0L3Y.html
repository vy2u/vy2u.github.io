it tell you I am so fucking excited to
be doing today's video because honestly
I was on Twitter you guys casually on
Twitter and I asked I was like watch
tiny phones way like I'm just kind of
like beating around the bush I leave to
Utah a couple day so I'm like what the
fuck should I do I need to pre film and
I had summer suggests to me do a
following or recreating a fans a makeup
like I've makeup look from a fan the
word fan in general can I get somebody
knows like I just like the word I don't
know why it's always gotten like on my
nerve even though you guys will say like
oh I'm a huge fan of you for some reason
coming from me if I'm saying I'm a fan
or that you guys are a fan it just
weirds me out I don't know why but
anyway the video is recreating a fans
makeup look because someone suggested to
me on Twitter to do that and I was like
wait that's actually a really really
cute and adorable idea I love it
so I asked you guys to send me a bunch
of samples of your guys's work and a
bunch of samples of your guys's art I
literally had thousands of photos from
you guys and a couple hours asking you
guys to recreate some of the looks I
live it kind of all over for a little
bit so you guys can like but one other
people if you guys wanted to get some
likes on it whatever it might be but
honestly it's wanted to say you guys are
so fucking talented I cannot even
believe you guys follow me it's like
some of your work it's like so much like
better than mine honestly like it's just
like the crazy thing I'm like holy shit
like your skills are like out of this
world literally how the fuck are you
even like one of my followers does that
make sense and just like it's just so
shocking because it's like so beautiful
the work is so amazing and I'm not
saying I can't do work like that but
that's not like my focus is not my core
focus I mean whenever I see people do
these imaginative beautiful looks it's
so like inspiring for me because I don't
really do those as often after there's
tons of youtubers out there that have
created something like this but I joined
to say thank you to the person that
tweeted me this I decided to go ahead
and screenshot I looked at that was so
beautiful and that's we're gonna be
doing so you guys I'm gonna recreate her
I looked at she had as always if you
guys like this video guys do not like me
please don't fucking watch it you know
the drill with that you know that you
with that hey but if you guys do like
this video please go ahead subscribe to
my channel if you're not already and if
you knew what's up I'm an emu waiting
well go to my channel thank you so much
for being there I really really really
appreciate it yeah let's go ahead and
get into this recreation of this eyeless
so look I decided to recreate was by the
Instagrammer makeup by Arabi or Kiara B
I'm not exactly sure how I say it
this is they look right here it just
like this really stunning beautiful
crease well I'll leave a picture of it
right here floating this is the look I
decided to try out it just thought it
was so beautiful and like such a fun
flirty I love that it has like this like
white lid but it has like this really
cool cut crease moment but connected to
like the blue of the liner the whole
thing was just so stunning to me that's
what I'm doing today guys recommend
creating miss Kira's makeup thank you so
much to reaching out to me on Twitter
and sending me a photo of yourself with
this I look it was so beautiful it
literally like took my breath away
without studying it was and I thought
wow wow this vid she's down to have this
visi eye palette right here and I have
my Sephora Pro eyeshadow palette right
here which is like tons of colors in it
so I thought let's go ahead and try to
recreate it this actually I also grabbed
this bad boy this is the Smashbox cover
shot bold eyeshadow palette which has a
couple colors right here as a yellow the
first color right here is a yellow so
let's go ahead and try to do this look I
don't think that I'm going to be able to
execute it as bomb as she does I just
don't I think that this bitch is just
talented like Keira you're a good girl
you're sickening and I live for you so
we're gonna do we're Justin go ahead and
try to focus these colors on the upper
on the upper eye and let's see how to do
that oh my gosh okay I'm so nervous
because I've never tried doing a video
like this is where but it's fun I also
think James Charles her to be like this
so shout out to James because I believe
that he did a video like this as well
cuz there's a couple other people have
done it but I remember James is the most
clearly but thank you again to everyone
that suggested doing this I wanna put
that into the upper crease up here I
really build on that yellow this is on a
more feet r39 amazing brush do you guys
know the more feet are series the rose
gold series is amazing cuz we got this
so far and then it goes like in tune
orange okay so then we go into an orange
shading taking the same brush we're
gonna go ahead and follow that not super
orange but it's like an orange moment
kinda okay Mary the to marry the two and
then we're going in with pink there's
definitely a soft pink moment there's a
lot more purples and blues and this and
honestly dozen really matter if it's too
messy because at the end of the day
we're gonna be
it's a cut crease we're gonna clean up
the bottom of it anyway this my idea to
recreate a followers makeup is such a
fun it's just like a fun idea like I
just thing it's really cool and I think
it's still possible to give some credit
to up-and-coming talent cuz it's fuckin
are you kidding me like there's so many
talented people out there that are just
like beyond amazing it would be really
great to be able to show some more left
to them you know I mean oh honey this
bitch just is its actual perfection like
I I really can't come with some purple
start to define it a little more we're
just following this little crease along
dragging her out okay okay we're
starting to get somewhere the whole
thing with this kind of look is
basically it's all about the blend and
just consistently blending throughout
the whole thing just taking it slow
blending and kind of just like leaving
space here so you can do the white
carve-out it's coming together I had
thought I was gonna be more flat but I'm
not as fast as I thought it was gonna be
which is nice to see I definitely did a
lot more purple than the blue and Arkham
align like purple more I'm just taking
this as it's like inspiration you know
let's go and take the blue from this
palette the Smashbox palette really no
it's fucking hard you guys like Paul
just not talking that much during this I
swear to God
this kind of shit take some
concentration like I'm not even gonna
lie okay alright just a constant
blending out you guys cuz I swear to god
this bitch will get you she'll get you
okay guys we're getting somewhere I feel
like this is gonna be where we should
stop because I swear to God if I keep
going I'm gonna fuck shit up okay guys
what do we think of this this is the top
of the eye so far we're gonna cut her
out to be carve her out with some
concealer I think we should okay this is
what we're gonna get this is gonna get
tricky cuz you don't do me and her me
and Keira we don't got the same eye
shape y'all so we need to be smart about
this okay guys so go and take them to
conceal it we're gonna go ahead and cut
out
because that Ranaut call I hope think
that's one will close it off so that we
can just do the eyeliner - that's just
gonna be our guide that'll be our guide
to where we want to keep it okay so what
do we think what are we thinking I think
it looks pretty fucking good actually
I'm Chuck I'm not so disappointed in
myself you guys the rotor failure you
like the little spot right there that's
kind of annoying you're right there and
a little spot right there there we go so
now what we're gonna do guys we're gonna
set the entire thing with white
eyeshadow the whole fucking thing whoa
so we got the eye on you guys oh my gosh
we got somewhere uh uh actually looks
fucking cool I'm really really really
happy
oh my gosh I'm like actually happy hold
on let me do a little wine over here -
okay so guys so now we're gonna actually
do the eyeliner part and I think that's
gonna be a little bit easier cuz
basically just doing the top part and
like putting it on the bottom literally
the exact same thing so we're gonna take
like the literally like the yellow and
put that in the beginning I don't know
how she got them to be ass pigmented as
they look cuz I don't think mine will
show up that pigment in so we're
literally gonna do eyeliner with the
eyeshadows she probably added a little
bit of like saturation on the color and
a little Photoshop on it which is
totally fine it's all good no hate at
all like no hate at all I live you know
I bit I fucking I'll fucking live so it
is not gonna look exactly the same as
hers because of it which is oh this is
getting so real you guys it's getting
really real we're trying to make it look
the exact same as the top solito see
yeah we can make this happen now we're
using a morphe 35c like a lip brush for
them but I actually really like because
it's so so so tiny and so thin I can
really get into I look with this because
it's so little see that okay film like a
clown feeling like a clown hey and now
we're getting into the deep blue now
we're getting into the missus deep blue
abyss we can do this I believe in us
okay now we're gonna take it on a more
if you are 45 notice outlining it with
the lighter blue because it would really
a really deep blue like an in deep blue
she I'm thinking that it was your
Pellatt again you guys I feel literally
like I feel pressure I don't know why
like I feel like I can't fuck also it's
really hard to do with all those fucking
fallout okay and if you feel if the look
is not clean enough by the end of it
we're gonna do the same thing we down
the top on the bottom we're just gonna
go ahead and this is where we are
currently act they combined at the end
this is what we look like up here pretty
good
top of the eye is done you guys this is
where we keep it as so the inner corner
had something really really shiny really
really really intense I'm gonna take the
little sleek makeup rockstars collection
this shader right here I'm actually
wearing it as a highlight today I'm
gonna put that on the inner corner
should so intense this is a look this is
a fucking look okay guys so what did you
have on the bottom lash thanks we're
gonna just do one eye on camera and uh
one eye off camera I mean if I can get
oh god I really hope I can finish both
eyes on camera because I swear to God
like I have plans tonight the bitch has
plans we're ready to yellow and we take
the orange line up with the on the lower
lash line a nice hefty amount I don't
mind a nice hefty amount okay and then
what if he do need she took pink a
little bit lower than that and in the
purple okay got the pink down and now we
do the purple look I need a deeper
purple than that it's not deep enough oh
my god this is like the prettiest look
I've ever done we're gonna take a darker
color actually we take a little bit of
the black from that Sephora palette on
the lash line we're gonna really deepen
that up a bit
oh she's taking all the way in okay
so look something like that you guys
this is the final look bitch this is a
fritz Bernays right here honey
did I do it I accomplished a lot I think
that I definitely have to look done miss
Kira definitely slayed it harder than me
but it's a little hard to go based off
of just the photo damn it
I think looks beautiful why is this
L'Oreal mascara better than so many of
the higher end ones I have why the dude
I'm talking to slash dating slash scene
yes oh my god he lives in San Diego and
he's staying over the weekend this look
is so fucking beautiful like wow I'm so
distracted by myself hey guys I'm gonna
go try to do the other eye off of camera
and see if I can even do what if I can't
do it the same as the same this took
like literally like 30 minutes
wish me luck I see that okay guys and
this is the final look we have both
sides done the left side I did in
literally maybe one-third the time as
this one so it's definitely like ugly
stepsister of this side but you guys get
the gist
this is dilute I honestly thought I was
gonna be a complete flop at this I'm not
gonna lie I thought it was gonna be a
look that I was like fuck teeth looks
like really really kind of hard these
are just looks I don't practice as often
so that's why for me it's a little bit
harder because I just do more so like
they say copper eye nude lip kind of
looks which I love those are my favorite
kind of looks to do I just don't do it
as many intricate looks like this but I
can definitely do them and they're so
fun to do and it's really fun to just
kind of go outside your comfort zone a
little bit more and this is what we came
up with again I just want to say huge
shout out to Kira for coming up with
this beautiful look it's so fucking
stunning like honestly I am blown away
with your talent it's absolutely
beautiful your page is beautiful
everything about it I'm like god damn
you're good and thank you for tweeting
me your looks they're so so so beautiful
and to everyone else that tweeted me
your looks you guys are wonderful thank
you so much for the tweets you guys are
so incredible and it's so amazing to see
how talented you guys are and it's just
so awesome and I honestly like it makes
me feel like I want to keep doing this
like I want to make this kind of a
series where I keep recreating your
vices looks just to give you guys more
of an opportunity to be seen on
different platforms you know I'm not
saying My Mind's like the biggest
platform ever or anything like that but
it would be cool to get more eyes on
your guys's looks if you guys like this
idea let me know in the comments bar
below and I will definitely make this a
series or something
continue to do because honestly I'd so
much fun doing in and it's really fun to
just look at a photo and try to recreate
it and see if you can get the vibe of
that look and for me it's cool because
usually if you guys just see a photo on
Instagram you're like dude this looks
beautiful but you don't know how to
accomplish it this is kind of like a way
to see how to do it
are these the way I like to do it or the
way that I accomplish the look or
something similar to it and yeah that is
it you guys I'll leave everything I
talked about linked down below all the
products I use the palettes that I use
