channel so today's video is not gonna be
tutorial on falling today's video is
actually gonna be a Q&amp;amp;A video um I try
to record this look look dude I don't
know what it was but like it was just
not translating on camera I was being a
little mask I don't know what happening
though I didn't record it so I posted on
my Instagram that wasn't do a Q&amp;amp;A video
and I was like ok cool it's ask me some
questions or something in 11 minutes I
got 600 questions so we're not gonna
talk that many but I try to screencap as
many as I could so I can get through
some so let's just get right into that
question
I literally just scream kept like at any
time so let's do what question number
one is from my Matt rising your names to
which me like Johanna oh nine to seven
asks when was your first kiss okay my
first kiss was when I was in high school
I was in tenth grade okay no I was a
senior I was a senior in high school my
first kiss and I was with a girl and it
was so funny I remember it actually
pretty well this her name was Samantha
yes Samantha I was a volleyball manager
so I was married to him and I kind of
like had a crush on her kind of she kind
of had a crush on me it was just like
weird like I don't know what I was
feeling I had like my hormones running I
was like gay and I was like I'm in Ruby
we were driving back on the bus
and she was saying next to me and she
says come here and I was like what and
she kissed me so I'll just like there's
got my first kiss so that was my first
kiss experience she like grabbed my head
and kissed me I was like to have your
 brain for three miles bridge
just down so okay next question vcr our
underscore asks you have been my
inspiration thank you for everything
well thank you um what keeps you
motivated even when people judge you
because you're man well honestly for me
what you see motivated is you guys you
guys as positive reinforcement to me to
be honest if I think it positive
reinforcement every single day if I
didn't get people that loved what I was
doing if I wasn't like confident when I
was doing I probably wouldn't do it so
um honestly like what I can say is like
my motivation for everything is you guys
you guys keep me like on my toes and you
guys are so kind to me and I absolutely
love you guys so much and that's
probably what my biggest motivation is
yeah big another big thing too is I get
a lot of amazingness is just
people that are like I'm so inspired by
you and you make me happy you make me so
happy and I feel like I can be myself
just by watching you and that's super
super super super motivational for me
cuz I'm just like you yeah dude I'm
talking keep doing what I'm doing
especially where I can like help other
people out like be themselves I'm gonna
do that go Wilmer underscore 19 asks do
you have a boyfriend at the moment so
okay this would probably be like 20% of
my questions have to do with dating 5 a
crush or have a boyfriend as right now I
didn't have a boyfriend I'm not dating
anyone and I do not have a question
anyone ok for me over if we're being
real real here or being real
real
I've never had a boyfriend in my whole
life I am 23 so that was another
question Adam I'm 23 I've never had a
boyfriend but um I think they're a big
reason behind it is because when I was
younger I was very very very introverted
and I was always very very shy and so I
just never really like branched out in
that way now that I'm a lot more
extroverted like maybe I can see myself
like dating someone are like having a
boyfriend or something like that but I'm
so busy with social media and like I
have no time to date what the
what's it what's a date I don't know
what that is but yeah right now I don't
have a boyfriend I don't have a crush
with anyone I don't have anything maybe
one day but I'm not actively looking for
anyone right now it's just not something
that I want to pursue right now because
you guys are what I'm for sitting right
now like I'm just doing YouTube I'm
pursuing social media and I'm trying
really hard to just make my name be out
there you know so that's my goal not
boyfriends are my goal my career is mom
go okay Trish nuts
that's cute asks how are you able to say
don't so down on earth with the fame
that is head of you please do please
don't change me and my sister love you
got a second date high minutes to make
sure to meet you lots of love
so Trish on to answer question how are
you both stay down hurts living there's
no theme like famous one of you
are on TV and you are in movies eating
security like that is more Fame to me
this is not Fame this is I'm a regular
dude making videos doing makeup like
there's nothing that I'm doing that is
spectacular and different than like than
other people that someone can do just as
easily and just as well if not better
than I am I think it's awesome when you
guys come up to me and say hi to me and
that makes me feel like I'm tall
followed me but there's nothing like
that does not mean that you're famous at
all so I don't think I'm famous
you could ask anyone in my whole entire
life like all my friends like they make
it seem like I'm famous like much more
than I do and my family - they're always
just like damn look at you you know last
 you're so famous now I'm like bruh
no not nothing that's so cool that's
what it is like
the reason I'm grounded in the reason
I'm so thankful for things because I am
thankful for everything that's been
given to me so I don't ever feel like
you should be like oh my god yeah you
know I have a hundred thousand subs or I
have a hundred thousand Instagram
followers - obviously I'm better than
you like that makes no sense to me makes
no sense like that doesn't make
sense at all or people that are like
they'll say things just because just
because they have more followers or like
oh we'll have his new cuz obviously have
more followers so I'm doing something
right uh yeah no bitch that's not really
how it works so I think the only thing
that's different about me is that I'm a
boy doing it and that I'm an extroverted
person and if that's if that's what
makes me different then like that's cool
that I'm different that way but there's
no way that me being Who I am right now
is different than other someone else be
including our on camera as well so um
yeah that's how I stay grounded because
there's no other way to not be grounded
and yet Trish not they can't wait to
meet you guys too
you were caught stalking someone on
Instagram who would it be Lily never be
asks that um we all do a double i winky
face oh yeah if I can stalk people all
the time I always talk like really hot
guys on Instagram like not gonna lie I
always talk like those like WeHo model
people oh and we'll we'll Jardel he's
making like healthy and he doesn't know
you my husband buddy you know um he's uh
he was the runner-up in our cuz Next Top
Model Cycle 21 key I come on I'm in love
with him
like I'm actually actively in love with
his yeah literally he hasn't been cast
off that's nice but yeah Hugh out
probably stalking his page remember I
posted the command crush Monday with him
in it and he like put like a hard face
on it he commented back in oh boy you
know so I was really happy about that so
yeah I probably sucking will joined out
right now at this moment H tide
underscore Jay asks how did you take the
plunge to YouTube and was it / is it
what you were expecting I'm honestly
when it comes to YouTube this is the
thing with YouTube I plunged in prepared
because I had soft boxes already I had
my Canon t3i I plunged in things someone
prepared
like when it comes to the lights and the
camera all that stuff like that was
prepared for it but honestly nothing
really prepares you for jumping into
like the YouTube world because the
YouTube world is so big and honestly
like I can say that you that Instagram
really did help me prepare for the
YouTube world like I was on Instagram
first before I hit up YouTube and I was
like like I was already getting like a
lot of support on Instagram and a lot of
hate on in scrims everything that you
get on YouTube I got on Instagram way
before so that really helped prepare me
for it but um the YouTube is definitely
exactly what I was expecting or what I
was hoping it was going to be I was not
expecting to grow as fast as I'm growing
which I'm so grateful for like I can't
even handle boom but um yeah it's
YouTube is everything that I was hoping
it would be and I wouldn't be able to
say that without you guys like for sure
because of your guys to support to me so
yeah I love it
so next question so jenny cogs asked
worried the class clown or shy growing
up you crack us up now well thank you
I'm happy I'm cracking um yeah but I was
actually the quiet shy kid going up
because I never wanted anyone to know
who was gay so I was always in the
corner doing my homework I was the smart
kid people are always like damn dumb
bitch no homo stuff so they will try to
be my friend just because like they I
was a smart one but I was very very very
shy very very introverted and so now I
feel like I'm getting out my extroverted
nasai mist through my whole life and
yeah I'm not really that shy now so
that's why I got Jessica I guess how old
were you when you started putting makeup
on and when did your fam what did your
family think of it love you boo support
you 100%
well think you're just good for support
and loving me love you too then love
your ass so yeah love you all um so how
old Rose and I start could be the one I
was taught me 21 when I started like
doing the makeup thing I've only been
doing makeup for about two years so I
just barely really got into it so didn't
21 and at first my family was not
supportive of it they didn't understand
my parents specifically were very very
not understanding of what I was doing
they didn't understand that it was just
me seeking a creative outlet for myself
that's what makeup was for me it was my
creative outlet to reach out and reach
other people in that way but my parents
didn't understand that and it was really
hard in the beginning I'm not going to
make your details when you Nick that but
it was definitely really really really
really really hard at first but it's
been so great now I'm like my parents
are so so so supportive of me like even
like now like I'm
welcome into room and she's like what do
we get today and I'm like mom be my post
office stuff alone yeah and same with my
dad my daddy loved today he was like we
need gave you like a studio we need to
build you something cuz like okay we
keep recording in your room like we need
something else like you need to get you
need to get big and I'm like dad I'm
your titty but it's really great like
now that they're so supportive so I
really love that so I'm very lucky
I'm very very very very very lucky to
have the family I have next question now
what's your favorite brush for blending
eyeshadow Sigma e45 your brush on wall
time for blending it's perfect favorite
brush for blending my can go into detail
I use it in every single tutorial so
that's it did you ever go to college
right after high school or in general so
actually yes I did go to college right
after high school I went literally like
I graduated then went to college I have
my bachelor's of science and health
sciences so I know how to read the pub
thing that would dumb ass bitch because
I the way I talk sometimes but I'm
actually educated I'm smart the makeup
world was not my career path my career
path was med school but I started
dabbling into it and then it became such
a huge thing for me and she's like on
hit scram like I'm well hana-chan for
like eight or nine months and I met like
114 thousand so it was just it was
really crazy so I had a I had to get
into it and I really I really really
really loved it and so now I'm doing
makeup and social meeting a full-time I
am very proud of myself for going to
school and I'm very proud to have a
bachelor's under my belt and I think
it's such a great thing to have and I
think that you guys can never you guys
should never forfeit school um and I
think that it's made me such a better
person it made me driven and it's made
me so hard-working because of my degree
and I feel like I'm a hardworking person
because of going to college and I feel
like I owe a lot to college so the
answer question vets are I did go to
college and I got my degree Samira
underscore and underscore a MN asks if
you had to choose between only using
bronzer or highlighters for the rest of
your life which would you choose won't
you just have my arms chopped off can

talk to me um honestly I would probably
go with bronzer I would have to go no
but look at my hand right now

something around thawing can't have
something question become so long
Bernadette JH asks where do babies come
from Fernanda dead dude I can't
handle your ass she's my manager at Mac
when I freelance there
well I'm Brandon they come from your
vagina laughing yeah okay underscore
wonder he'll ask can you talk about your
tongue piercing experience and
everything about it because you can work

Agustin I got my Tom Christian I was I
think 19 and those money first like
rebellious like yeah I'm gonna do this
I'll give cuz my parents were not
cool with us having piercings are not
cool that's how many tattoos like they
don't want anything like to be on our
bodies or anything like that so I was
like well I'm gonna rappel I'm 19 I'm
rebelling I don't care so I had time on
my mom Lee my tongue pierced
and she's like 99 so stupid and I was
like I know I'm just kidding
and then like one day I was at my house
and I was like with my tongue here's my
 down so I went and got appears I
came home and I mean honestly it really
it really did not hurt like the initial
going in did not hurt but the three days
after her was up bitch and I got home
and I was like just take talking my
girls just like talking like this I was
just like well hey guys what are you
doing just so much right Joe bites ugh
and um I was talking to me and she
turned around how's Amy she's mention
her up so I was just like and she's like
she looked at you say hey I like a
gasping moment for air kind of thing
it's all just like I got it here's 13
and she was just like why you keep me
manual are you kidding
so I just kept it since then my dad he
saw it one and he saw it a couple weeks
later and he's like what the -
every time periods and I was
like
so yeah I just L just wanna see if you
can I've had for four years like it'll
just like my first rebellious act of
anything like I'm a teenager hear me
roar I'm about any twenty that's why I
did it so I just thought was fun doesn't
haven't taken it out okay I just feel
like it's like my first like childhood
rebellious act and I don't want it to
get off yet a Christy Callum underscore
beauty asks how did you grow so fast
besides being amazing oh thank you um
honestly I have no idea how I
grew so fast I literally have no idea I
think people can see through the
 and I don't you guys
so I think that's a big thing and I
think the fact that being a man doing it
is very different like there's not that
many guys doing in so I think that was a
big thing of people like sing it and
they're like oh my god that's different
I'm gonna go in fall and I think that's
how it worked I honestly have no frickin
idea how I grew so fast I have no idea I
just I'm blessed I literally like well
pray and be like thank you so much for
the amount of weapons before I get like
I kid you not I pray about that all the
time I always say thank you all the
whole time I'm always so grateful for it
and I think that you guys know when
people are being sincere and when
they're being fake and I think that
that's a big thing to like people won't
grow as fast if they're being fake and
there's been kind of like bitches and
they're just like if they're shy and
introvert and just kind of do their own
thing that's another thing too I'm not
very shy I put myself out there and I
think that's what it is to putting
yourself out there being in it is a huge
part of it you know what I mean like I
would not have gotten the support I got
it if I didn't really try and put myself
out there you know I mean I tried that
myself out there and sometimes it works
in your favor and people love you and
sometimes people don't let people will
hate on you so just kind of depends
you'd have to really ignore all the hate
and just focus on the positivity and
that's what I try to do and yeah I'm
just really blessed and I think that's
how it goes fast is just I'm so blessed
and I just have gotten so much support
along the way that like that's how I got
um how I grew so fast yeah yeah gay
couples asks I don't you guys follow me
funny they ask

day I'm a fan of bitch yeah it's
