yeah let's go and get into this
favorites video
hey cool the first things first first
favorites of this month is definitely
going to be this bitch right her I know
this is not out till February
technically it's like not out yet but I
just got it recently and it is Patrick's
formula X collaboration it's like the
little video that plays that's my best
friend C motion all because I'm so proud
of him okay so I'm gonna try me with the
centella Patrick I teamed up with
formula X he's a color curator for this
year every month a new color curator
happens and he is the color curator for
February and I just recent got the
package and I just want to say how proud
I am of Patrick he did a three nail
polishes with them they are these three
right here it's I mean it is February so
he chose pink ones because it is like
the February is like the month of love
and I think he did such an amazing job
with picking the colors they're awesome
the lightest one is a she better work
the pink one is yes and the glittery one
is lucky star so I think these are so
great I definitely want to try on one of
the clothes maybe I'll put on like she
better work on the cap inky or something
I don't really know
I'm so proud of Patrick for doing this
collaboration it is so amazing I can't
wait to go to Sephora and see your face
inside Sephora oh my god that's just so
freakin sick I'm so proud of you that's
amazing one day I'll be right there with
you it's not today one day I could not
be more proud of Patrick I think he did
so amazing good job Patrick what love
yeah as I said earlier I do not have a
lot of products from this month's
favorites but I do have two products
from Anastacio that released recently
inside January I believe they look
really syn January I'm not quite sure
but I have the new on associate brow
definer you guys honestly like I'm
obsessed with the brow definer it is a
brow pencil honestly has the brow wiz
which is a great pencil as well but this
one is tapered on one edge and it's a
little bit thicker on the other edge so
it's great at getting more of a full
effect or a really thin effect whatever
you want to do and to create with it you
can because it is shaped in the way it
is it is seriously just the best I
honestly love it so easy to use I'm not
really the biggest fan of brow pencils
honestly that's just not my style I
don't like brown pencil very much but
this one
is that so good I'm so impressed like
I'm honest he's just so impressed huge
congrats to them like they're killing it
on a sausage brain is just sling
everyone's life right now and I think
they're awesome I love them as people
too I think they're great in my opinion
this is better than the Broadway's I
will not even be using the Browse
anymore I'm going and using the define
it because I think it's that bomb truly
it is it's just such a good product and
I don't know I just love it I think it's
like the brow is x 5 so next is the
anastacio glow kit in the that glow
shade you guys the glow kit - I'm
telling you on a stick killed it this
month like a month such an awesome kit I
think it's so great that they comes with
four colors you can mix and match them
they are a very high reflecting shine if
you build them up you swap oh my god you
swatch them and like you just
get in a good way in a good way
the colors are absolutely stunning I
think the right here can you see the
pigmentation is phenomenal I think
they're great because you can build up
this product it's not a put on right
away and it's like BAM like intense
highlighting I like that kind of
highlight but not everyone does and so I
think they did a really great job at
making these buildable and so when you
put on a layer of it it's a nice glow
and it's beautiful on the skin Boni put
on like two or three it's like intense
shining bright like a diamond like
intensity which I love that's my style I
love to do like really intense
highlighting I'm wearing one of the kits
today not this one I'm wearing the pink
one but I think that if you guys were to
get one of the two I would go with that
glow I'm a big fan of golden like
highlighters so this is definitely means
my style I absolutely love it
I think they did an awesome job with
these let's do more face store for to a
little drug store item that I want to
talk about - really quickly I want to
talk about the L'Oreal True Match Lumi
cushion foundations the foundation I'm
actually wearing today
I think this foundation is so freaking
nice it's beautiful it is buildable
coverage gives you a luminous finish is
so comfortable on the skin it doesn't
feel like I'm wearing foundation
honestly and I feel like my face does
look really really nice and all one
color it's not like intense however
though because I am more on the oily
side they need to do a mattifying primer
and set it with a powder throughout the
day because it will break up on me a
couple hours later if I don't do that
because I
and really really really oily this is
definitely a foundation that's meant for
more people that are normal to dry but
if your oily you can totally work with
it you can make this work man you can
make this work it is seriously so bomb
having the shade and 3.5 it's cool cuz
you get like a little it's like a little
cushion yeah I could open this
it's literally like a little cushion you
like press onto it and it gives up like
the color I just get a kabuki brush in
it I'll just dip a brush into it and
just I honestly have no bad words to say
about this besides the fact that it's
more for dry people but I'm not dry but
I think it's actually amazing so if you
guys can't try out the true match Lumi
cushion it is bomb honestly like I feel
like the drugstore prices aren't they
going up like a might just trip in but I
feel like the drugstore prices of things
like they're going up I think they're
getting a little they're going a little
ham on a bitch you drugstore though stay
in your lane I don't know maybe it's
just me but the price is going up next
item for the face is the Kevin laQuan
sensual skin enhancer I have been using
this all month I'm in the shade s xo2
this is a little tub concealer you guys
it might not look like I've gone through
anything like but I have used this so
much a little bit goes a tremendously
long way it is a full coverage creamy
concealer so that means you do need to
set it with a powder because it will
crease on you if you don't I promise you
it will crease like a so
you want to definitely set it with
powder like the Laura Mercier
translucent for example I'll put it on
underneath my eyes in the t-zone and
like a little bit on the forehead and it
looks absolutely stunning it's very very
bright I'm wearing it today and I think
it looks gorgeous I think looks
seriously freaking gorge it is pricey
though I remember it was like really
expensive I was like oh right in the
heart just turn the night it was
expensive what about a product that you
get I'm not kidding you guys like I will
probably never go through this my entire
life this will be like the one I have
for my whole life I will never go
through this besides the fact that it is
really really creamy and it will crease
on you if you don't set it I love this
Wow Keva Daquan you sexy wait
were you sexy looks like next and last
face product that I want to talk about
was the Marc Jacobs insta Marc Mirage
filter I don't know what this is called
but it's like basically the duo you guys
honestly like this is seriously one of
the best banana
under-eye powders I've ever tried
not the best it is so finely milled so
smooth just absolutely mazing I know
like when it first came out a lot of
people were talking about it and they're
saying like how bombed it was but I
never tried it something expensive like
I'm not gonna even go near that but I
went to an event recently this month in
New York and it was Marc Jacobs beauty
and I got one of these and I'm like you
know what I really need to try this out
so I tried it it is the best under-eye
powder I've ever tried it is ah it is
just so beautiful it gives you like an
almost like an airbrush finish
it's very brightening I haven't even
tried this cold yeah I feel like it's a
very very cool tone color I bet it's a
nice color to contour with though I
totally bet it is
I've only tried the under eye
highlighting powder and I've been using
it like non-stop I tried it like I
learned worn it like five times every
single time I'm like my undereyes though
what the do you guys want a really
great under-eye powder it might break
the bank it might break the bank
it is expensive a F but it is truly an
amazing product last two items guys it's
the last o okay so the next item I want
talk about is actually the color I'm
wearing on my lips it is the dose of
colors chocolate wasted at liquid
lipstick I think this color is so
beautiful dos DOS and I go way back we
really don't know I think we do I think
that the DOS liquid lipsticks are one of
the best liquid lipsticks on the market
I think they're absolutely stunning and
the fact that they just keep putting out
amazing colors it just makes me so happy
because I feel like their products are
just getting better and better and
better and better and they just release
I know they just recently did the ideal
duo's I tried one so far I've only tried
it once so I'm not gonna say like that I
love it or not because I don't really
know I feel about it yet but I know for
a fact that the liquid lipsticks are my
obsession
they're creamy they dry beautifully they
don't feel heavy on the lips they're
very thick they're completely dry but I
don't feel like it's drying my lips out
which I love this is that's why I love
the DOS liquid lipsticks so much
chocolate wasted it's part of the new
collection they let that launched this
month and I've worn it a couple times
already and I'm like why this is so good
and last but not least I wanted to talk
about another really cool like in the
Instagram brand
is the melt stack this is the
radioactive stack and I really want to
talk about this because I've tried a
couple of the colors already and I think
they are amazing this is the stack
that's like neon yes see it's like a
super cool bright stack so this is
basically your pop of color stack this
is an awesome way to incorporate pops of
color into your life without having to
buy like whole palettes and things like
that are like individual shadows melt
like I'm not kidding like they do such
amazing shadows and say let's watch them
let's watch them bright ass orange like
bright AF oh my god like so pigment
yellow is very hard to get thick mint in
so the fact that this is like pigmented
is insane god they're gorgeous honestly
look at this do you see this it's insane
it's insanity is what it is they remind
me of DOS in a way because they are like
more of an indie instagrammy
brand that's not really at any stores
online but they direct Fame expensive
like that so I really do love those so
much I want to use them more when he's
I'm like I don't I wanted to like a
really cool intense like neon II
tutorial with them because I think
they're stunning you're gonna get a fall
out with these ones they're just so
pigmented because there's such a bright
intense colors when something so ultra
pigmented it's gonna have fall out it's
gonna be a little bit more loose because
it's packed with more pigment so it's
gonna be a little bit harder to work
with not like to work with necessarily
but it's gonna be a little bit harder to
get no fallout okay so but I mean
honestly I don't even care because
they're worth they fall it to me is not
that big of a deal and I think you guys
should double check out the melt
radioactive stack the other stacks are
amazing I've all of them but this one's
really really really cool and they just
launched this one and I'm so happy for
them Mike if you melt is doing so great
and I think there's such an awesome
brand so yeah I love them and that is it
for my entire January favorites video
add so much fun Koreans for you guys let
me know what you guys loved in January I
am so excited for this new year to
happen I'm just so ready I'm so ready
like I've been I'm so ready I'm just
ready for my pal to launch like honestly
like I'm so ready you guys have
been such troopers with me throughout
this experience it's been so tough like
waiting I'm like so impatient with that
that kind of thing because it's supposed
