about doing favorites and
disappointments for every single month
if I have disappointments that month I
might as well throw them in cuz I did do
a disappointments video and it did go
over pretty well with most of you guys
not everyone but most of you guys did
react to it very well because you guys
like to sing my opinion on both the
positive and the negative when it comes
to the beauty world so I figured you
know what I'm gonna try to toss in some
favorites and some disappointments for
every single month and so I'm gonna
start off 2017 strong with January
favorites and disappointments hopefully
you guys enjoy this video let me know if
you guys like this kind of style video
if not it's totally cool cuz I do try
out so many different things throughout
the month and sometimes they work for me
sometimes they don't and I never really
talked about the don'ts so why not talk
about them in some of the videos I don't
so yeah guys let's go and get into
favorites and disappointments video as
always if you guys want this video if
you guys don't like me please don't

aren't already and if you're new what's
up I made anyway welcome to my channel
thank you so much for being here I
really genuinely appreciate it so much
but yeah it's gonna get into this
favorites and discipline okay guys to
the first favorite of this entire month
which you guys probably saw from the
thumbnail oh my god you're knocked out
right now honestly I cannot believe
you're sleeping yeah let's just say hi
let's just say hi really quickly really
quickly I know I know I know so my first
favorite of the entire month is Zia she
is my baby doodle she's a mini doodle
actually so she's actually just
purchased against my she's so tired it's
1:00 in the morning right now so she's
done she's knocked the out she's
tired I ain't no mommy I'm sorry I know
you're tired oh my gosh she's the reason
you just you're not sleeping right now
are you you're sleeping like this like
this oh well she's perched right oh oh
second wind second wind okay she is
my first date of the entire month she's
absolutely precious she's amazing either
just got her a couple days ago and I am
so grateful to have her I cannot I felt
like I was missing something in my la
home and I know I have Nick here with me
but I just felt like there's something
missing I just felt like it was a pet
you know I have pets a San Diego girl
with dogs and cats and I've always grown
up around animals and I didn't have one
here and I felt like those like this
part of me that was missing so when I
got zaiah
like it like filled that void and it's
like even more so because she's like my
little child and I feel like so like a
proud parent and I kind of like a
 nervous as parents took
another bet and I was like freaking out
sorry random tangent but I I loved her
so so so much and I can't even handle it
she's only ten weeks old
and she's about three pounds and I think
the biggest she'll get is how big will
she get the big show get they said was
probably around eight pounds tops so
Zeya
my baby girl Zeya is my favorite of the
month number one favorite because she's
actual perfection okay guys so my second
favorite product of the entire month has
been this body butter stick this is some
h2o beauty this is the teak rose on the
move body butter stick hydration that
melts on contact the reason I love this
so much is because of the convenience of
it I'm not the type of person that will
like after a shower go and get like a
jar unscrew the jar get like a
body butter from the jar like a pie on
my skin I'm not that person if you guys
aren't a fantastic I'm so happy
you guys are but I'm just not that
person it's not gonna be enough for me
so this guy you literally undo it it's
literally like a deodorant stick and you
can just like what I like about this so
I start everything right now because I
can you know and it smells so
good if you guys like body butters and
you guys like convenience this is the
bitch for you so I like my elbows always
get dry so I always like to put the body
butter on and I like to take it when I
fly I get really dry on my hands and on
my elbows and like areas that crease a
lot on my body when I'm flying because
of air and the skies are so much more
drying so I'm taking the h2o body stick
to go basically so what the main
ingredients I believe our coconut seed
butter coconut oil to help moisturize
and nourish the skin it's just so
convenient and I absolutely love it and
if you guys are interested they do have
a dry body oil it's a body oil and sighs
literally I could spray oh one sheen I'm
not a body oil person either though like
I'm not really a fan of body oils I
personally like to stick more but they
do have an oil tea
interesting like coming out of the
shower doing a quick spritz so we're
just talking about some skincare items
any mood a little bit sorry um I want to
grab some base products and face stuff
first
i jus i talked about this really quickly
one more time because i love it so
freakin much and I've been using it this
month religiously like non-stop this is
the hourglass banner stick foundation
I'm in the shade ivory
it's what I'm wearing on my face right
now it's just okay the reason I like it
so highlight though it's
everything it's just such a good
foundation because it's so lightweight
but gives you maximum coverage but you
can share it out if you wanted to you
can build it up if you wanted to it's
just so so so so nice and I just love it
I've been using it all month long what
I'll do is I'll put on this foundation
do a couple steaks on my face do a quick
spritz of Dior era flash on top pack it
in with a packing brush and I'm good to
go and I just get a really beautiful
like flawless base that's not too heavy
looking which I am obsessed with the
guys are looking for a really nice ass
foundation I know I've talked about this
before in a different favourites video
probably a couple months back but this
one I just revisited recently and I
really can't get over it like it's so
beautiful I wish there's more product in
here do not get me wrong I wish it was
so much more product in here pisses me
the up truly it is such a beautiful
ass foundation and reason for looking
for a nice high-end foundation stunning
check out the hourglass vanish stick
it's so good next product is this okay
this one has become my or
ride-or-die at this point it's so
absolutely amazing as I started using
this I haven't used the other one that's
equivalent to it and it's gonna be a big
deal because you guys are gonna
freak this is the cover effects perfect
setting powder and the shade translucent
light there's two shades I believe
there's a light and there's like a
medium I'm in the shade light of course
because I am quite alabaster you know
this powder is a godsend to me
it's so I like it better than the Laura
Mercier and that's saying so much
because Laura Mercier has been my go-to
like the translucent powder from Laura
Mercier has been my go-to for the last
year so basically Laura Lee is when I
kind of got me says she's like hey she
should try out to cover FX powder
because it's actually bomb it's
similar to the Laura Mercier one but it
has no talc in it so I give me as heavy
feeling and does have like that cheap
filler that talc is I mean just it just
is a cheaper filler tried it out and I
couldn't even believe how finely milled
what this is like quintuplet
mill but it's so fine and lightweight
but still gives me the same effect as
Laura Mercier which means give my oils
at bay
keeping it like full coverage keeping it
like
intensly perfect setting powder but not
as heavy looking on the skin and eyes
heavy feeling I was blown away that it
gave me the same effect but not as heavy
and as cakey looking or feeling as laura
mercier and i was like a sold i
have not used the lar Mercier once since
I got this powder and I says I started
using it so kind of like I'm shook like
I'm shook like shook next
compaction product I talked about this
blush really quickly because I don't
wearing it all month on it's actually
the blush I'm wearing how many cheeks
today this is a clinic cheek pop in the
shade 18 pink honey pop this is the
shade right here it's like the most
beautiful warm baby pink color I don't
know why it took me so long to get on
the cheek pop bandwagon
there's such a beautiful it's like the
formulas beautiful the packaging is
beautiful that's a cute little
Daisy imprint I don't know if that's the
Daisy I don't know anything about
flowers it's literally the perfect pinky
blush I want to like put some on to show
you guys also this is the type of blush
that you need to build this is not a
type of blush that you put on is like
bull pigment you build it up you have
full control of it it's just absolutely
beautiful I put some more on top of this
one it's just such a pretty like pinkish
soft color go to Sephora swatch on
your hand a little bit swatch on your
finger swatch on your taint swatch it on
your tongue do whatever you want to do
swatch it and you will be surprised and
you're going to OH
like it's set let's talk about
one more little hang product so this
product this is the star lit Powder by
Makeup Forever this is like one of the
newest products they just came out with
starlet powders which is a really really
intensely pigmented pigments but they're
like like hella they're not I just like
another pigmented they're like
pigmented this is in the shade in 13 and
this is an iridescent pearl light
pigment you guys this pigment itself
I've been using it as like a topper for
my highlight it's actually what I'm
wearing on the inner corner of my eye on
my brow bone on my cheeks it's so it
comes out on this cool little sifter I'm
just gonna show you what it looks like
on my hand I'm gonna swatch it it's like
the most intensely blinding ass thing
we see that this is so
extraterrestrial blinding it's out of
this world I'm actually wearing the
golden one on my lid right now - just a
little sprinkle on top it's just like
they're beautiful you guys can't check
out that makeup ever starlett powders
especially the shade 13 shade 13 if you
want this intensity so last two items in
my favourites part are going to be these
two right here both lip products this is
the new more feet liquid lipsticks in
the shade virgin oh my god this formulas
somebody's look at that are you guys
seeing the swatch this shade
virgin makes me want to lose my
virginity all over again I've lost it
over the doll though this is the shade
right here it's not only is a beautiful
color it's an absolutely beautiful
formula and I'm so impressive
morphe for creating this honestly I am
like I feel like they really stepped it
up they set their boy pussies up man
like you stepped it up and honestly like
I was so pleasantly surprised that a
brand like morphe who sells these
lipsticks for 13 12 13 bucks for a
liquid lipstick like uncanny can do such
a beautiful ass formula such a beautiful
formula that's really like nice and
creamy and luxurious filling for 12
bucks how is that this feels like more
luxurious than some of the
highest and liquid lipsticks I've tried
and it's $12 how I don't know how that
you do it also of course I'm in morphe
Affiliate if you guys want he's my code
you can man um you wait in store online
if not it's all good
honestly if you hit me that I talk about
the codes I don't care let me
talk about a code if I want to like
this is my channel if I want to talk
about a code about something that I
 love actually like why wouldn't
I you know so I'm gonna give me an idiot
you see you use ooh you yeah second
lipstick and promise you this is gonna
be lasting it for the favorites is the
Maybelline lipstick in the shade
babe that's a lipstick I'm wearing on my
lips right now oh my there's nobody
there let me just say that I love
Maybelline's matte lipsticks I think
they're phenomenon I think
they're so pigmented they're so
comfortable on the lips right now it
doesn't feel like it's a matte it just
feels like satin and comfortable even
though I know it's more of a matte
finish I mean if I kiss something it's
gonna transfer a little bit it's not
like so when matte but it doesn't give
you an intense shine like as you can see
on my on my hand it's not a shiny ass
like Sheen
and the shade based babe holy I
have worn this this month I don't I worn
it maybe like six seven times and I've
only worn out makeup like eight times so
that's a thing something you know but
honestly the shade beige babe is
absolutely amazing and to Maybelline
lipstick can go by for like six or seven
bucks
and I truly think that Maylene has some
of the most beautiful drugstore formulas
and I just think they have some of the
most beautiful formulas in general not
just drugstore their lipsticks are just
 bomb honestly truly the shade
beige babe is so pretty and I think it
would flatter so many different skin
tones whether you're socialite in
complexion medium and complexion if
you're darker you want definitely use a
darker lip liner because it is a light
shade as you can see but it's so
beautiful and it's such an everyday
color I just love it
okay guys so now it's time to talk about
the monthly disappointments and I only
have two products I only have two so
we're not gonna go to Christ's sake and
guys when I do this just remember again
that these products work for you guys
love them so much
that's great it just means I
didn't work for me personally my taste
buds just weren't feeling that flavour
of the day if you know what I'm saying I
just have these two products if you guys
love them awesome I'm so happy for you
don't be pissed I don't like them but
they're just not my cup of tea the first
one I'm sure you guys can kind of guess
it I think you guys can this powder from
Becca this is the soft light blurring
powder in the shade golden tower so I
come to realize that this is basically
the translucent powder they claim that
you can make with this but honestly you
can't it is such a heavy ass powder and
it oxidizes so dark have you guys saw my
get ready if you guys something get
ready with me using new products I try
this powder out for the first time and I
was shook in a bad way like I
was like mmm like I fell down shook and
it just wasn't it just wasn't a nice
powder like I really wanted to like it I
really did made my whole face so much
darker than it is like I was truly
shocked and kind of mortified a little
bit like a little a little nugget of
mortified powder itself looks heavy on
your skin it doesn't look lightweight
and soft and like luminous it doesn't it
looks heavy as I don't know it just
sucks like I was expecting this powder
to look super lightweight and finely
milled it just really really pretty and
my humble opinion for my skin type and
what works for me I would definitely
suggest the coverfx powder over the
Becca soft powder because it just wasn't
good and I really wanted to love it I
did because I love powders that are
translucent they're just nice
but it was it just didn't work for me I
wish it did so yeah this one sadly was a
disappointment for me okay and the
second disappointment I had for this
month are the Urban Decay liquid
lipsticks okay and this is the reason
why I don't like kill me so these are
the new vice liquid lipsticks are
supposed to stay on like crazy amount of
time and so like waterproof and intense
and they are they stay on like crazy
which is so great if you guys want that
it's amazing so so great but what I'm
disappointed in is the consistencies
between lipsticks they're not the same
summer creamy and pigmented and intense
and I'm like yes bitch work and some of
them are so sure that's why I brought
two to show you guys so I have this one
1993 which to me was actually really
pretty color this actually worked for me
let me show you guys I must wash this
shade right here will show you a real
like life swatch as you can see it's a
it's a little bit streaky like barely
streaky like a little bit but the claims
say that these are very very long
wearing lipsticks that dry on and they
do not budge little makeup background
when things claim to be that every that
there's a lot of alcohol in the product
and then it really sticks to the lips
and so on there's a lot of alcohol on a
product it's going to shear out it's not
gonna be as pigmented because alcohol
mixes weird with pigmentation it just
does I don't know why it is but it is
but this one was like one of the nicer
ones but this one and the shade flame is
what I'm talking about with a
disappointment it just was not the same
let me just show you guys what it looks
like
what I think would work if you put this
on top of like of orange lipstick that
was already an orange lipstick as your
base or like a lip liner that was orange
I put this on top it would totally work
if you guys have it you can definitely
make it work I just personally think for
myself I will literally never wear this
because of the fact I have to layer it
so many times to be by itself I think
it's a cool color it's like a cool ass
flame orange with gold flecks gold
glitter fakes in it that's sick
it's just not pleasant and I wanted
three buzzes it's not like it wasn't I
mean I personally love urban decay and I
personally love Becca so much I've done
events with both of them and I
absolutely love the brands personally
but this for me these guys were just
misses if you guys have them and they
work for you awesome and I'm so happy
they do it just Saturday's have didn't
work for me in the best of ways you know
but what can you do and yeah guys that's
it for the entire video because I had
fun watching it I had so much fun
