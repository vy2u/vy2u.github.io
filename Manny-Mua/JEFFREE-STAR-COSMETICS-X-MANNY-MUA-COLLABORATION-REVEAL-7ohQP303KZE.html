it's a pie only one freaking time hi
everyone welcome back to many channel so
today is really exciting I promote the
button I got you know what to say like
I'm so so so happy think this has been
in the making for such a long time yes
when do we even start discussing a cloud
this is like over a year ago yeah a long
brain the idea sprouted and I just felt
so right at the time and a lot of people
have wants a cloud with my brand all
2016 and I was like you know what no I'm
just gonna do me and I just felt like it
would be such a perfect collaboration to
work with someone that's actually my
real friend best friend and then have
like a real relationship yeah no totally
and I just look we're always on the same
page like wired Treach it was so easy
and so good easy peasy we might fucking
hold this collaboration is really
special for me this is my first collab
ever with my brand and I'm so honored
and happy that it's with you I'm so I
couldn't more honor that you chose me to
be yeah so so so exciting this is
actually like one of my is my fourth
club yeah like in the span of three
years in my fourth club yeah this is the
one I've been the most excited for is is
that the most genuine friendship I've
had with the brand yeah I burped the
most I've been excited I'm like nervous
like I'm sure like I'm no no and it was
really hard to keep it a secret
like we told a few friends but we didn't
want it to leak everything leaks online
now doing everything it is so quick
quick accidents have been accidents do
happen many may be slipping once or
twice uh-huh but it was a good thing but
it was it ended up being all great and
you guys have been so receptive and so
loving towards our collaboration and we
couldn't say thank you enough it's been
so overwhelming so great the remember so
far has been unreal so of course now
it's time to reveal what is inside the
magical box that everyone's been saying
everyone's like open it up
as always guys if you like to like this
video if you guys don't like us please I
can't watch it please don't you know the
drill with that
haha okay guys when I was time to reveal
the collab bond oh this is this is
actually just outer sleep - yeah just a
guy so it's like a slipcover like when
you get an album or a CD and a sly dog
slowly make sure your skin
sort of looks like guys ever been cool
awesome crescent moon with Jimmy Starr's
emblem we decided just because both of
our emblems that we've been using for a
long-ass time or a moon and a star I
mean come on when the stars in the moon
align I think it's perfect to put our
logos together buying them and they look
so cute and I think we ought to looks
fantastic and I think that we it just
turned out beautifully like I think the
team worked amazingly on this and it
just looks fantastic
yeah the hologram the black like that's
how my last clap was so we really want
to incorporate that into this one that's
very very branding yes also with you as
well so I'm sorry and I've never done
like any black packaging for my entire
brand yes it's been very paying very
loud so I thought it'd be really cool to
just kind of like flip it on a whole
nother level and just do something
really different yeah no I completely
agree anything in trim out fantastically
is what you guys do is you slip off the
little slip cover this boom bang again
this super super cool it's on this matte
look like a glossy black print on this
matte black packaging this is an actual
box for it so this is what the box
everything comes in playing oh I'm dying
here I know so then we open it I mean a
little flap has us on it right there so
cute so yeah so we open it and you have
this super amazing badass hologram and
super cool triangular effect here on the
actual unicorn itself it's so so cool I
love that it just looks like it's moving
almost pixelated which is so cool so
cool I actually love it so this is what
it looks like guys yes so I know a lot
of you have been asking and everything
in the bundle will also be sold
separately yeah definitely awesome so
but if you do want to get the bundle
together it will be for what at this
kind of price so just gonna price at 50
bucks so to near 50 dollars for the
entire bundle usually if it's to the
clip sticks and a highlighter it'll be a
65 bucks so that's a really good deal

situate and if you don't and you just
want a lipstick or maybe just a
highlighter by itself you those options

any part of the collaboration separately
and on side the bundle Gus and use a
code Manny anyway to save 10% off yeah
individually yeah not on the bundle but
I've never done a code on my know they

seven code part yes SM Sol jokes aside I
thought it'd be really cool for also for
all many subscribers and everyone that
loves us together to get something cool
for the game ever because you are
getting a great deal for the bundle so
we wanted to include something with
those who want to buy individually yes
so if you guys want to buy individually

at 10 a.m. Pacific Pacific Center time
time yeah the center time so April 8
it's around the corner I'm so excited to
literally coming up so quick four days
after my birthday that's what it is so
now as you guys I'm sure are dying
they're like my ear above the actual
colors and the names of the colors so
let's get right into that okay the first
thing that we're going talk about is the
highlighter yes which is this guy right
there you know oh oh the packaging alone
when I decide Gina is literally so
badass it literally looks pixelated like
I thought that it looks like it's moving
when the light and the Sun hits it is
everything I love that you wanted to do
something different like not a lot of
brands do this crazy type of like
reflecting packaging and I love it so I
I'm obsessed with it so unique what she
called the name of her is eclipse yeah
okay the reason I wanted to name it
eclipse is because when the Sun and the
moon align it's a lunar eclipse so that
was so cool down at Sun middle star and
obviously I love moons so an eclipse is
what happens and I die other clips was
sick is perfect but I never talked about
the clever way that you like you having
any days on my going on Eclipse yeah I
would like right
yes we're done great you're got always
no shame guy it just does like that the
names like it just does like your gut
knows the names and I think eclipse
works perfectly switch it's so blinding
like click that's bad no I don't think
anyone's been noticing but he's been
wearing it a lot in his snapchat love it
I like where and I'll maybe go back it
this week laughs under channel and it's
it's everything and there's something
special yeah oh my god okay so yeah

stamp in the powder and let's show
everyone what is it wanna do Sam whoa oh

moon stamped along with of course the
jeffree star emblem inside it so we have
the moon stem and we have the star even
the outer packaging itself is it's all
black it's Matt Matt has a hologram let
the back has this really cool yeah with
the Mohawk like packaging Chris and baby
boomers Eclipse oh so so cute how would
you describe this color I would describe
it as a icy peach agreed it's a really
binding it's blind right Horizonte

510 okay and I'm gonna use the UH
Nastasia a 23 highlighting brush perfect

of my videos the last month and I'm just
like I just love how it looks on camera

so finding it so intense and it's
obviously like Jeffrey's formula which
is already so so so nice it's so creamy
and so blinding so I've like this icy

crying on is the shade daddy yes I just
thought that would be such a fun name
like we say it all the time we do it's
so fun people like call us daddy all the
time all mine it's just a fun thing
there's another thing in I just really
thought the name daddy will be so
fitting for lipstick
usually I'm tied up that's the safe word
um yes no you're not sure this color so
you guys this color is a obviously more
of a cool tone medium brown she looks
like this BAM oh this color though guys
honestly so like the reason I chose
these college guys like I do
the pink nudes all the time where I've
done the clouds like what the pink nudes
and they're great and I love them and I
wear them all the time but I want to do
something that I still love and wanted
to just be a little more different

stone like oh I need to hurry the F up

really cool tone but I feel like it
could work on literally any skin tone
you can tell because it's like a medium
tone color it's not like super like it's
not super Dora it's right literally
right there work on every skin tone why
is the complexions - I feel like some of
the deepest complexions you can really
wear and pull it off it brings up your
eyes so crazy does it - - I just can't
wait for everyone to try this Shane it's
so so so good and I think you guys
really like it because it is a neutral
color which is still very very mean like
I'm still very much in the neutral realm
but it's one of the cool tone end in the
warm tone it is so I really love it this
color hi okay guys so the next tray that
we have is I'm sure whoa I mean honestly

not going back everywhere when we are
bored boys when we came up with the name

it's really matter like even if there's
a lot of fun fun catchphrase I love it
yeah we did Adventure is fun and it sums
up our lives yeah so this color is
actually like a burnt coral yeah that's
how it says it already it's stunning and
I know since we're launching this in
springtime I thought it'd be such a
perfect shade it is for spring it's so
beautiful same it's a medium tone color
it's not gonna be too light on people
it's not gonna be too dark on people
it's just gonna complement so many
different skin types any skin tone where
