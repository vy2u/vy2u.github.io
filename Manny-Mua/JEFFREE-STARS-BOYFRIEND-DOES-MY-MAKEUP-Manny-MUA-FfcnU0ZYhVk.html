dinner like a late dinner a PF Changs
yeah there's like two years ago guys
it's like two years yeah this was a wild
little of that I don't know chemically I
remember that but that's because it's
like one of the first times I met
Jeffrey - and then concealer I don't
know what the fuck that really looks
like you should start pulling this shape
tape oh wait that sounds about right
hey let me pull it on look at it I pull
out nice little dark
let me see through sir there's okay
there you go
there's the white one I know all the
colors of mr. snip okay figure out how
much oh let's just put it in your
eyelashes or your eyes
squeezing little about a hefty is it
waiting a hefty amount is it I know
was there mm-hmm mmm your hand feels
great I feel like you're definitely
definitely done before is it usually
when you have more light like oh this
way oh my god look I don't know how far
this goes over quickly this is your
video yes is gonna decide where things
gone mm-hmm you know Christian like can
I do this clean so what are you now
powder under that because it okay dry
it's like I know I got a pat so I don't
move everything around
oh my gosh you're so knowledgeable you
said your own channel I know I should
just start anyway Nathan I'm gonna come
for you oh he's coming for my fucking
gig I'm coming you like to do your
contour next I believe mm-hmm your
contour and then your blush
so quite a couple items so you can just
guess what you think it would work
already I have utter faith in you I feel
like this isn't the right brush for some
reason doo doo we're gonna go ahead and
go in with this Marc Jacob mmm let's
think it goes right around in oh my
Lanta it had a little too much on it I
was starting to freak out fucking boys I
know you love it my Myrtle boys he
doesn't like what I do Myrtle no yes
that's kind of like where it's inspired
money yeah that's your own yeah it's my
own twist with no lips Oh like that
listen Chevy so much work it's
relatively even does it yeah it's not
very severe but I'm not like I'm gonna
see that you're finding oh hey but it's
cool it's good it's my day people say
people want me to be hot color
well okay kind of hard to figure out
what brush users like so many brushes I
don't understand how you use all these
older used oh they look you date every
single one dirty then what use this
energy looks kind of cool heartthrob
blush mm-hmm what did you first think
when we met because we're made with
Jeffrey yeah yeah no I mean obviously we
were born on yeah we were both like
trying to gauge like your coolness level
hmm you know ya know we actually liked
you right away we actually went home and
we're like oh my God we're like he's
actually really cool like he's never had
a gay friend before either
right so oh yeah like I'm I gave him our
that no yeah he had never had a gay
friend before and he was just so excited
he's like like you know telling me that
he was like actually excited because he
hadn't had like a real loyal cool gay
friend more it's always been dudes
because he has been the music scene
right that's for yeah it's always
straight guys yeah yeah yeah I mean I
was really stoked to oh so happy my man
you guys I was like thanks I'm really
really great and so I was like I was
like a fan like no yeah I didn't like
really fathers get that feeling and like
I was in like it was really I really
watched Jeffery you're like follow his
life as much I knew who he was but I
wasn't like a follower her fan of his
which I felt like was good because it's
like it makes it look like yours you
just gotta become friends without having
any preconceived notions as probably
they are you know of course I feel like
that was like a cool thing that's
actually we hit it off like so fast yeah
we did and I feel like we were hanging
out in like a week
yeah nobody where i was re going over
mm-hmm I bet you're not yeah I mean your
solution already oh it's like it's kind
of serious yeah that was really cool and
then we're here now more than here we
are and you're clowning me yes I am and
you're turning me to prettyprint now we
do highlight this is like the one brush
that I know for there we go
is this one so let's use back in I could
I think I might be able to find on
something that I mean we can perhaps we
can have shoes they never use I think
that'd be a really good move yeah I see
a lot of highlighting
what kind of like you know I know you
know the chief but you actually no work
of that I'm very impressed hundred
layers of highlighter yeah you can't go
wrong
you can't especially not with this color
Eclipse so glad Eric's our cosmetics
website my collaboration with Jeffrey
use code man anyway September Simone
it's hard to see over here would write
that knows that oh yeah I can see my
shit hundred layer a blood get anybody
everybody now what is next
well I failed to do that contouring your
nose ice which I know that requires like
a stick of some sort
oh did you see that or is that just me
my god well um let me just slid the fuck
out like a piece of shit I don't know
ground right now feels like a tootsie
roll cool uh why'd you cut it don't be
dirty like that
okay we've checking back in oh there's a
hair with one there's a fuckin hair
oh shit we're not using all right boys
oh my god so right does it feels right
that damn holistic like yes I really
like that I know I'm fucking totally
wrong because I was going to use a
beauty blender and blend that shit out
to perfection now I don't even know can

if you want to browse okay we got the
four in the five brow pencil okay and if

thick with eyeliner and all going figure
what's uh what did you do don't worry

silence me oh and that's uh that's a
hard touch they're not like you are a
