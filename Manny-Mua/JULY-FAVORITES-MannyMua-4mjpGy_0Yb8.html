first time I'm filming in like weeks
weeks it's before I went on the cruise
so it's been it's been a crazy past
couple weeks you don't mean like what's
going on the cruise with Patrick
laura-leigh and Kristin with Gabby
everyone like it was just a huge fun
group it was just so much fun and then I
went to Vegas for like work stuff you

went to Vegas for a couple days and now
I'm finally back home I'm sitting down I
actually go out of town in a couple days
so I can sit down and film and just talk
to you guys I just miss you guys so much
and it's funny because when you're
youtuber like and you go out of town you
like really miss filming because you
miss your subscribers it's like the
weirdest funniest feeling I'm sure I'm
not the only youtuber who thinks that
but like I just feel like I've been so
out of it and I just miss you guys you
know what I mean so yeah I'm just being
a softy little weirdo little
nugget but yeah it's a June and July
favorites I'm actually excited bout my
faves this month I've really been loving
so many things and I've some things are
not even just makeup too so that's
pretty exciting I never really do non
makeup items in my favorites about today
is gonna be about makeup item - yeah but
you haven't stop rambling it's going to
get into the July favorites video as
always if you guys want this video if

don't like me if you don't think I'm
cool you all think I'm genuine you don't
think I'm creative don't watch me that's
simple as that but if you guys do like
this video please like this video and
subscribe to my channel if you aren't
already and if you knew what's up MNM
your way and welcome to my channel thank
you guys for being here I really
appreciate it
yeah it's going into the July favorites
so first things first it's gonna get
started on today's video I'm gonna start
with the items that are not beauty
related or not like beauty ish so first
things first I'm gonna start off with a
pair of Stu's of a better suit I'd never
do this but I've been really really
liking this pair of shoes recently these
are the adidas ultra boost uncaged shoes
I so my brother Nick met the middle
brother is basically like a sneaker head
like he loves shoes and I feel like he's
been kind of rubbing off on me to like
shoes more and he has a pair like this
and he told me to get up here because
they're really really really really
comfortable so I went out when I was in
Vegas and I bought this pair and
honestly this is probably one of the
most comfortable I've ever worn ever
adidas I've just been killing it
recently I have a pair of Yeezys and I
love the way those feel as well but
these just feel so so so comfortable and
they're a lot easier to find then
obviously these are frigging hell on
earth but these uncaged ultra boost
they're so lightweight and they're just
so nice like a running shoe but I wear
them for casual wear because I can go
and run a know it lets me know it's the
top of it is so weird because it looks
like a sock it's like a little Saki and
you gotta like go in its juicy out
stretch its lips like a little mouth
like a little beak um so I just really
like this pair of shoes if you guys are
looking for a really nice comfortable
shoe that feels like you're walking on
clouds that fits very comfortably and
you're gonna be able to walk for like
miles wearing this without being
uncomfortable how doesn't check out the
adidas uncaged ultra boosts I'm not
gonna wear shoes I'm not I'm not good
with that I don't know anything about
them but these are very very comfortable
and I like the all-white ones cuz
they're just classy as are
those classes black hello I love them
next thing I've been loving for this
entire month actually the past couple
months I just don't really talk about
them that much are these key glasses
these are pink these just so happen to
be a collaboration that two-face did
with key you can't really find the pink
ones anymore
I believe but I've been wearing these
sunglasses all month long
I get asked every single day on Twitter
what glasses I'm wearing these are from
key Australia these are called my girl
you guys hang at the pink pair I know
it's kind of annoying that guys can't
get the pink pair I wish that two-face
did more of them because they're
adorable but I have this pair I have
another pair that's black I wear them
all the time there's such a pretty cute
pair and I think they would look so cute
on so many different people like look
how cute these classes are are
you kidding me my girl oh they're so
 adorable I just live for these
and if I can breathe for these and I die
nice knees for him so I don't check out
the key my
I think they're like 50 bucks they're
not too too expensive it's kind of
expensive but they're not like
outrageously priced but I wear these all
the time and I really have gotten my use
out of these guys because I wear them
 everyday every day next beauty
related product that's not actually a
makeup product is the loving tan deluxe
bronzing mousse in the shade dark and
you guys have Magda you go yeah you guys
saw me do my first ever self-tanning
experience because I had never done one
before ever and I was so nervous I know
what to do I just pulled up Jacqueline's
video and like how to soft and I'm like
please let this work because please and
it honestly the loving tan stuff this
ship works like this is BA I really
really really like it the shade that I
use was of the shade dark um and I
thought the color was so so so pretty I
didn't try the ultra dark in the ultra
dark and the dark worked very very well
for me but mind you I am very very very
light I am NOT dark in complexion
whatsoever I'm like an NC 25 so that
keep that in mind if you're darker than
me you might want to go to ultra dark
but the dark was so nice and okay what I
liked about it so much is I put it on it
was super streaky looking and I was like
 I up like it was gonna look
so bad that wasn't look terrible in
discussing because I waited the amount
of time it's a two-hour Express mind so
to our Express so I waited the amount of
time that you're supposed to wait for it
and after two hours I took it all off
did it looks tricky on my body
whatsoever like those no streaks
anywhere it just looks tricky going on
and then after two hours I kept
developing for like an entire day I got
darker and darker and darker and I was
like I was it was a shocking experience
we had no idea what I was expecting but
the color turned out so so so beautiful
and it went on very very evenly and when
it was coming off it didn't come off
patchy which is the most important thing
I've gotten spray tan before and when
it's coming off it just looks like I
look like a freaking like patient with
some disease like it was just no it's
not cute at all but this one for some
reason when it came off I didn't come
off bad I don't know why I just didn't I
was like I just get lucky that I just
exfoliate well who knows I tried it
twice now and I can really say that I
freaking love it it's so good loving ten
dark most this is all over YouTube
everyone talks about it and everyone
loves it but I I mean how was I supposed
to know until I try to myself it's
freaking sick I'm just gonna talk about
these very very very very briefly these
are the new more feet elite 2 collection
brushes more feet discontinue the early
one
collection and came out within the lead
to collection of brushes that are better
that is more slim and they have a better
bristle and they just feel softer I just
want to briefly tell you guys because I
have been telling you guys that morphe
was gonna be coming out with a new line
and it's early to collection absolutely
amazing brushes I'm so happy that they
kept their elite collection in general I
posted a photo on my Instagram I'll
leave it right here I'll post it out
I'll put it right here but on my
Instagram this photo has the twelve
brushes from the entire collection that
I absolutely love I'm not talk about
them too much in depth because I have
created more few favorite brush videos
before but I love you guys how to ask me
and I did post it on Instagram my top
six eye brushes my top six face brushes
from this collection and so you guys can
definitely check that out if you guys
are interested and I just wanted to
bring them up really quickly because
they are amazing brushes and I just
wanted that you guys know they are
really really affordable and yeah you
can obviously use my code mani anyway to
save you guys some money if you guys
want to I'm an affiliate with them I'd
let you guys know that I am an affiliate
with some brands if I am affiliated with
them don't feel like you need use my
code whatsoever I'm not pushing you guys
at all I'm just letting you guys know
that you guys can save money and I do
appreciate it when you guys use my code
don't ever think that like I don't
appreciate it because I very much do cuz
I mean this is what I did full time
that's kind of like how I make my money
you know me so yeah I would say the more
feet Elite Collection number two is
absolutely amazing out definite check
them out
try them try the next product okay cool
so basically consider that has been
running my life Tarte shaped tape
concealer has been ruling my life in the
past month I'm not use another concealer
in the past month since I bought this
and it's such oh don't you not explain
this concealer is so good okay so it's
full coverage which obviously I love I'm
a full coverage Queen obsessed it is
definitely more on the stick consistency
but it blends up so nicely it's not one
of those thick concealers that it's like
you're like pouncing for three days to
kind of get it out you know what I mean
it doesn't feel like that whatsoever
lends out like a freaking dream stunning
gives you that amazing coverage of
highlights very very very well as well
the best part about it my favorite part
about it is that it does not crease
easily it is such a crease resistant
concealer and I never ever ever try to
concealer that's this crease resistant
that's a really important thing to me
because I crease a lot when I'm just in
general I crease a lot in my under eyes
like I'm one of those bitches you know
this prevents creasing so well of course
I started with powder anyway just
ensure longevity for like 10 hours plus
but this concealer is absolutely mazing
and it's also great for all skin types
it's not a drying formula whatsoever
it's so very very hydrating which I mean
I honestly have nothing back to say
about this not one bad thing I'm like
getting nervous I'm gonna be running out
soon I can see it's like I'm I feel like
I can just see through it it's like I'm
gonna be out soon so definitely
definitely check this out the shape tape
concealer by Tarte you guys will not
regret it I use the shade light because
I like to highlight with mine as well
I'm using it today sadly this is not
available at Sephora it's available at
Ulta and I think on tartes website as
well so just letting you guys know you
guys can't find it at Sephora but you
can't find it at Ulta and it's just it's
an ultra exclusive and I'm like digging
it Tarte why'd you guys tell us to
Sephora to this one have kill'd support
sales like gnarly alright next is a
powder that I had been literally living
for this is the la Prairie cellular
treatment loose powder I've used this
you I saw in my first impressions video
that I tried the la Prairie powder and I
loved it in the first impressions video
and I have been loving it all month long
it is so good okay so the thing about
this powder it's not like the Laura
Mercier powder work it like keeps me
matte all day long it's not like that
kind of out of this powder is very very
very finely milled and gives you a
beautiful finish but it's definitely not
a powder that's gonna like keep your
makeup on like 20 years you know what I
mean like the translucent by Laura
Mercier because I will continue to get
oily throughout the day when I use this
powder unlike the Laura Mercier one I
don't really get oily about the day
because I use a lot of that this one
doesn't really do that but it gives you
much more of a light weight finished you
don't look nearly as cakey or heavy like
the Laura Mercier one makes you look so
I really like that about it I use this a
set underneath my eyes and set my smile
lines because this also is so good at
keeping products crease resistant like
if I'm using the laura mercier
translucent I would put it in my crease
lines
I also crack like a like
hardcore but with this one I noticed
that my creasing and my smile lines is
so much less with using this powder I
don't know why I have no idea why it
just it's just like that and just that's
just what it is if you guys are down to
spend in our middle like it's like $100
for this powder simple but you guys are
down for that definitely check it out
because it is so freakin good or get a
sample from like Nordstrom or wherever
the they sell this I bought this
online talk to you recommended it so I
was like I'm getting it
obviously okay one more item and I'll be
completely done one minor this is what
I've been wearing like the entire
 month the Anastasi of modern
Renault's Renaissance
right doctor the Anastacio of Modern
Renaissance palette has been my go-to
palette the entire month it is so I just
I keep using it like I use it constantly
all the time I love this palette so much
I don't know if you guys have seen but
I've done a tutorial using this palette
I think the reason I'm up obsessed with
it is because I love most of them if
most of them are matte like almost
almost all the shadows are matte like
this very there's a couple of chambers
but mostly everything is matte and I
love these kind of transition shades I
love that warm that berry those kind of
just like orange II like shades as
transition shades are so beautiful to me
and this pot will complement so many
different skin types because the colors
in here are definitely more on the bold
side which will show up so nicely on
different skin tones and whatnot so I
think that honest hacia really killed it
with this palette it's absolutely
stunning and it is permanent in their
collection so hell yeah go on a saucy I
think this palette is sickening I don't
even know how they're gonna top it after
this I really don't because I think this
probably is absolutely amazing and it's
a staple in my collection and the reason
my palette is so dirty and disgusting
all over it it's because it's in my
travel bag and I use it all the time so
definitely check out if you guys haven't
already that modern renaissance powered
by an associate Beverly Hills you guys
will literally not be disappointed
they're so nice so buttery so creamy the
one thing I'll say about them that
annoys the share to me is that they are
very powdery like when I dip my brush in
so much powder flares up like so much
I'm like like overwhelmed with powder
but honestly with that I can look over
it because the quality of the shadows
and the way they blend and how nice they
are it over weighs it so much more so
I'm like whatever I'll deal with it so
definitely check out the modern
renaissance product by Anastacio if you
guys haven't already
it's freaking good and one one last
thing I'm wearing the ofra liquid
lipstick in per se just in case anyone's
wondering what lipstick I'm wearing it's
like a metal lipstick and things really
really pretty
first time I'm trying it on my lips
right now so if you guys think it looks
pretty it says what am I mean and that
is it for today's entire video I hope
