today's video is going to be my
favorites video I am so excited to film
this I absolutely love filming favorites
videos you guys know this I love them I
think they're so fun to film I think
they're so personal and just like me and
you guys talking and just chatting about
what our favorite products are and we're
literally just connected on the aspect
of let's find good and let's use
good you feel me you feel me
but yeah I'm sorry Emily as always if
you guys like this video if you guys
don't like me please don't watch
it you know the drill with that but if
you guys enjoyed this video and you guys
do like me please like this video and
subscribe to my channel if you weren't
already and if you're new what's up I'm
Manny mua and welcome to my channel and
thank you for being here
always I like to start off with skincare
products if I do have any skincare type
of things I could start off with
skincare as a favorite so I have two
products the first one having talked
about is the Clinique take the day off
makeup remover for lids lashes and lips
you guys I had no idea that this was as
good as it is what the freaking heck no
one told me it is the best eye makeup
remover I've ever used it's better than
my bow Jemma it's better than my Sephora
one it's better than the Neutrogena when
it's literally better than every single
remover I've ever tried it takes off
everything so effortlessly and it
doesn't sting my eyes and that's so
important like this a41 it takes off
that makeup well but it stings my eyes
which kind of annoys me this one removes
everything so nicely and it doesn't sit
in my eyes and I absolutely just love
that I hate when my eye sting when i'm
removing stuff so this is the best i've
ever tried this one and if you take the
day off balm for the whole face is so
good - I would I put that my favorites
but I can't find it I lost it somewhere
I don't know where it's at at all
I just think Clinic has really really
really great removing makeup products
like they do so absolutely well this
remover is so good if you guys want a
nice gentle remover that doesn't scene
your eyes but takes off literally
everything including waterproof stuff
check out the Clinique take the day off
it's so absolutely amazing
the next product that I have been really
really really liking this month is the
touch-up polish classic rice enzyme
powder this is a rice powder that you
mix with water and it becomes like a
gentle exfoliant the reason I had been
liking it so much is because I use it
every single day as like a step after my
cleansing step it's almost like as if
it's not really an exfoliator because it
is so gentle but I have noticed that my
skin's texture has been improved in the
last month I really do think that it is
because of this I'll use this like
literally like five times a week all you
have to do is report some of the powder
in your hand mix it with water and you
put all of your face and you just
massage it in for like 20 seconds and
then you wash it off gotcha is like a
really high-end skin red and this little
guys like 15 bucks so definitely try the
$15 one before you buy the big one which
is like a bigger size like this is like
60 bucks so they try out this small I
want to see if you guys like it I just
think it works for me well if you guys
are looking for a really intense
hardcore exfoliator that is like deep
cleansing and whatnot this is not really
the type for you this is definitely more
of a gentle bully ATAR for people that
are like more sensitive I don't know
your soul to actually use this every
single day probably like three to four
times a week but it's just so gentle to
me
I can use it like every single day my
skin has been just fine I was like in
everyday it's perfect I love it when
it's next in the world okay cool so I'm
going to go in with two highlighters
I've been living for this month first
things first is the jeffree star
cosmetics ice cold highlighter you guys
look at this pan look at his pan look
how monstrous this is this is look at my
face I have a man face you guys know
this is a man big face I really think
his formula is absolutely beautiful it's
so creamy it's so pigmented
and has a very high reflection - which I
love I'm actually wearing ice cold on my
cheeks right now as we speak I just dust
it a little bit over it just a little
over my highlight already and it just
gives you a such an intense like extra
like umph to the look and I think it
looks beautiful what I think you did
such a beautiful job with these
highlighters the second highlighter I've
been using all month long is this one by
sleek this is the Solstice palette it
looks like this I actually only use one
shade in here and it's this shade right
here it is a very very high intense
reflecting highlighter it's like
ridiculous I don't even know how to
explain it it's just such a high intense
shine I have it on top of the ice-cold
one right here as you can see both are
so gnarly it's like a very soft pink
shade as more pink in it than the
iSchool Linda's but it has such a high
intense reflection to it as well this is
from sleek makeup I've literally never
even tried anything from sleep before I
have no idea their products their other
products are nice or not I think this is
a UK brand I found out though like I
actually use in a video recently and I
found out that the ingredients are not
FDA approved in the US so like you can't
really buy this palette right now and
I'm like what the I think you can
only buy on like Amazon or Ebay so
hopefully by the time this video goes up
they'll like handle it I didn't actually
in the process of getting it approved in
the US so you guys should buy it again
but what I bought this I bought it off
the sleep website like no problem and no
problems with it whatsoever and I bought
it easily shipped to my house I was good
to go but now if you go to click 'add
like Add to Cart it says like cannot be
purchased in your country so I'm like
bitches are getting in trouble but it
honestly is such a good highlight it's
so reflective and intense and very
bright and I really like that I've been
really into really bright intense
highlighters as you can see just a
little subtle thing yeah right bugging
thought ofö
adjusting it's really really good and
this whole pot is only 15 bucks that is
such
good price when you get four
highlighters and you guys can if you
guys are not on the United States get it
get it while you can
brow products benefit you have stole my
 heart this month with brow
products this is the goof proof brow
pencil and this is the 3d brow tones you
guys benefit just recently launched a
huge huge like 10 SKU line of brow
products in Vegas and I was there with
them during their launch and it was just
absolutely so crazy because like no one
knew that they're coming up with all
these crazy brow products that are just
great so I've been using these two
non-stop all month long and I have not
put them down they're actually what's in
my brows right now this is goof proof I
love the packaging first of all the
packaging literally sells me they told
me that this entire line was inspired by
magic wands so everything looks kind of
like one like and ready genie in a
bottle and very just cute which I love
if I can kid me I love magic I'm a
magician to my heart this is what it is
you take off the two little ends and you
get like a nice little brow pencil on
the side right here it reminds me a lot
of the brow definer by Nastasia but the
shape is actually different it's like
shaped like a hexagon down here on the
bottom part and then it tapers up to a
point like a teardrop so it does have a
similar shape to thought associate one
but it's not the same it's not too harsh
it's not too waxy it's a very pigmented
and very blendable and I just love that
aspect of it and has a little spoolie at
the end you can you can't go wrong with
this fully at the end you just can't
this is actually what like I'm living
for the whole entire brow line this one
is probably like my favorite of all of
them this is called 3d brow tones and
this is a brow highlighter a highlighter
for the brows it literally has small
specks of like glittery reflect in it it
gives your brows a lot of dimension I'm
actually wearing it today if you were to
look close on my brows you would see
that it has like some like extra
dimension in my brow adds like a sheen
to the hair it makes your hair look like
it's like highlighted and it gives you a
lot of dimension to the brow which I
absolutely love as soon as I saw this I
was like oh it's in my favorite product
like duh and it actually has been it's
been so good to me I think it's
absolutely beautiful so this is the
shade for I actually like the shade too
a lot more - is the more bright and
intense highlighting one this is more of
a chill like not so highlighted one so
I'm actually gonna tie to benefit for
number two oh yeah I want a new number
two and actually use the shade in number
five in goof proof-- only two products
left so all month long
literally all
month long I have been wearing reflux
pearl glitter by Mac everyone has been
asking me like on social media like if I
almost have chat filmed a look and I'm
going out to an event or something I've
been wearing reflux pearl by Mac it's
such a beautiful glitter you guys it's
so good I forgot how good this glitter
was cuz I had it in like uh and like a
bag of mine that I didn't know where I
put and I was like okay whatever so I
found it I was like oh I wanna put this
on put on my lids and I forgot how bomb
it was reflex glitters are so finely
milled they're so soft and subtle when
you feel them but they're so intense on
the eyes which I love I don't like it
when that glitter is really chunky and
harsh on the eyes I like really fine
glitter that reflects intensely and
that's what these are and reflex Pro is
one of my favorite ones they've done
because it does have a really cool
golden champagne reflection to it it's
so pretty I'm not gonna open right now
because it's so intense and they all
like spilt everywhere and I'm like no no
I'm not on this carpet not on this
silver carpet bitch no try-out reflex
pearl it's so stunning or just going to
a mat going to the Mac Pro open and just
look look what it looks like put it on
your hand and you'll see how intensely
glittery it is but so finely milled and
so subtle at the same time so I just
really like this glitter and you guys
should definitely check it out so good
and last but not least is actually the
lipstick I'm wearing right now on the
lips this is the maybelline blushing
beige lipstick I actually use this in a
tutorial very recently what your tour is
I used to send guys hmmm I don't know
what it's called I don't know what it
was called but I use blushing base for
the first time and I've been wearing it
so much this mud it's so beautiful it is
absolutely a beautiful lipstick giving
me to show you guys right here this is
what it looks like it's a very pretty
babydoll pink new lipstick it's very
light though okay guys so the reason
looks a little bit darker on me is I use
a darker lip liner around my lips and
then I you put this in the middle of
course so if you guys are darker in
complexion then me definitely use a
darker lip liner to make the lipstick
work on you because it will look very
very very light and kind of just like
weird and like kind of white on the lips
if you guys don't use a darker lip liner
but I think this formula is just a
beautiful creamy lipstick it lasts a
good amount of time on the lips I mean
doesn't like last that long like a
liquid lipstick would but it's a very
creamy very pigmented and just so
beautiful and I think my lips look so
like supple and luscious when I'm
wearing this lips
and I'm just like I just wanna
mmm do bad things you know I won't do
 bad things on this lid you know
so I just think it looks absolutely
beautiful and I've been wearing this
non-stop omelette the Maybelline does
such good lipsticks you guys if you guys
have never tried any color sensational
lipsticks buy them try them out they are
so good
I love the matte ones the matte ones are
stunning they're stun mean that things
and they're from the drugstore like what
six or seven bucks such good lipsticks
for such a low price point you really
cannot go wrong so Maybelline you guys
killed it with those lipsticks and
blushing beige has been my favorite for
this month and I cannot stop wearing it
just looks so pretty I love it and that
is if my entire monthly favorites I hope
