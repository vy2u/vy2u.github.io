so today's video is going to be my June
favorites and disappointments I
absolutely love love doing favorites and
disappointments videos and I actually
have a bunch of favorites and three
disappointments I've only ever really
had two disappointments in a 1-month the
fact I have three I'm like oh oh I have
been going nonstop the past month of
June it's been absolutely insane I'm
going to Africa at the end of the month
I did VidCon I did I was in Ohio I'm
coming out with merch really really soon
that I'm trying to get in the works and
they're proving and things like that my
parents are moving up to LA it's like
god there's a lot there's a lot of
things a lot of things that's going on
right now but that doesn't mean I have
not tried a bunch of this month and
I actually have a lot of products I've
been really really liking some I'm
actually shocked that I loved as much as
I did and some oh my god slow so
yeah you guys not to tell you they do is
going to be is going to be my June
favorites and disappointments as always
if you guys don't like this video if you
guys do not like me please don't
watch it you know the drill with bad
guys come on
or in 2017 don't watch me if you don't
like me but you guys do like this video
please subscribe to my channel if you're
not already and if renew what's up I
might emulate and welcome to my channel
thank you so much for being here I
really genuinely appreciate it so much
for being here and watching my videos
and not rambling let's just go ahead and
get into today's video of my June
favorites and disappointments
okay so first item that I have been
absolutely loving and living for this
past month has been this this is from a
jeffree star cosmetics and this is the
velour lip scrub in flavor watermelon
gum you guys oh my god like I literally
get chills every time I smell it because
it give me like flashbacks to my
 childhood I was actually lucky
enough to smell this and try it out
before I actually launched and I
love it I love a good lip scrub I just
like it so much more than just some
sugar like on my lips I like if it's
scented and just cute packaging I'm just
a bitch of packaging you know and you
can definitely DIY your own lip scrubs
but I just think that jeffrys are so so
nice and they smell so good and they
taste so great and I just think these
are absolutely mazing and if you guys
could try any of them try the watermelon
gum from his new summer collection it's
just damn so next guys we have the Urban
Decay Naked skin shapeshifter I've been
really really living living and actually
breathing for this I don't
know why but I just and what I love
about it so much is this beautiful
contour shade it's a very nice just cool
tone Brown as a nice highlighting shade
you're gonna color correct if you want
to and I also love the powders these
powders I've been using interchangeably
this is for contour I like to use it for
contour personally and this one's a
highlight my under eye and you guys the
quality of this is just absolutely
amazing
like wow urban decay y'all y'all really
did that y'all really did that
look at the powder look it's so smooth
so buttery it's just like wow you guys
weren't really putting any games now
were you and the reason I really really
like the contour shade is because it's a
very very natural color it's not really
intense it's not too heavy you can
really build it to be really pretty and
natural or build it to be really really
intense and very intensely contoured
getting shapeshifter I'm like urban
decay you all did that and I think it's
absolutely amazing
especially you want a highlight contour
photos if you're a makeup artist and you
need something in your kid that's gonna
be great for a lot of different skin
types they also have a medium shade I
think that they have to so this is the
light to medium and then they also have
a medium to dark as well so I personally
use of course they liked to medium shade
and it works so well for
me so I absolutely love it next
is a bronzer that I have been living
breathing dying gasping for air living
in prison for the past couple of years
for this is the Marc Jacobs tantastic
bronzer you guys already know that I
love the other Marc Jacobs bronzer I
think it's absolutely amazing but but I
think I like this one more I think I
like this one more and the reason why I
like it more cuz I feel like it suits
more skin tones I think that this is
much more of a pretty neutral bronzer
it's not as warm as the other one I love
a good warm bronzer I really do but I
think that for more skin types I think
that the tantastic works amazing and it
smells like coconuts oh I don't know
what it is about Marc Jacobs bronzers
formula it's just one of the best
formula for bronzers I've ever ever
tried if you guys have never tried a
Marc Jacobs bronzer or even just like
felt it guys go to Sephora feel it touch
it it's amazing it is a pricier item but
there's so much product in here that
this will last you a good what
year and a half like this is insane I
use this almost every single day and it
looks like I hasn't even been touched
doesn't say it hasn't been touched helps
like hasn't been touched I don't know
how I don't know how this formula is
absolutely beautiful look at that little
finger you guys are conceited I've been
loving this month this is only conceit
I've worn this entire month this is all
I consider I've worn this is the soft
matte complete concealer by NARS in the
shade of vanilla
mami has been going good you see how
that word divot in there did it
I've been going so in with this
concealer because it's so pretty
it gives you the most beautiful finish
it's matte but it's not like drying
looking matte it's almost like a dewy
matte finish it's full coverage it sits
beautifully on the skin I haven't even
worn my Tarte one since I've been using
this one honestly that's saying
something
it's definitely a little bit harder to
apply it in the Tarte one of course you
need a brush to go with this one or I
personally what suggest using a brush
with this one I use the more feet why 11
is just a really perfect for me it's
just great picks up the product great
deposits is fantastically and it buffs
it out super super easily
that's the brush I would suggest for it
is that morphe y11 it blends out so so
well and doesn't crease fast on me
either
and once I set it it stays in place all
day
it does not move and I'm just like wow
nars Norris has good concealers I've
always really liked the NARS radiant
creamy concealer I'd always thought that
one was really pretty but this one this
one like beats that one's ass like
tenfold now for two lip items that I
have been living for I have been loving
this color pop gloss in the shade
curvy and this is actually a
collaboration with Karen aka I love SATA
II and color pop they collaborated to
create this gloss and I just think it is
the prettiest most perfect nude gloss
it's so beautiful oh my god that is a
lip bitch that's a lip honey the
whole entire collection was absolutely
amazing but this is something that
really stuck with me and I have been
wearing it all month long and I'm like
wow and it's like what six five bucks
five or six bucks that's good the
other lip item that I have been loving
shockingly Selda I've been really liking
it is this by Kylie cosmetics this is
the naked Velvets liquid lipstick and
this is from her summer collection and
you guys this color is just so look at
it it's just the most beautiful neutral
nude shade
I can't good I do you see that do
you see that nude and I just been
wearing it all month long because it
stays super nicely but it's not drying
and it makes my lips look really pretty
it's not like a matte lipstick where it
falls into the lines of your lip it sits
over the lips really beautifully and it
just gives it just a nice pretty pout
and it lasts so long on the lips you
guys I can wear this all day and
it'd be like still on it I mean won't be
on there like a lot like a matte
lipstick would it has a really good same
power honestly it really really does and
I'm just like oh come on Kylie stepping
it up I think that her velvet liquid
lipsticks are so much better than her
matte liquid lipsticks that's just my
personal opinion I think that they feel
so nice they're so pigmented they're so
creamy and they don't dry down the lips
at all because I think that her lipstick
formula is a little drying for me it's a
little too drying so her velvet liquid
lipsticks are definitely like a good
in-between for me another thing from
Kylie cosmetics I have been loving all
month long I know shocking
hey who's shocked hear me and I don't
mean me a bitch but just like I'm
shocked because I've had so many of
Kylie's products in my disappointments
throughout the months she's always come
out with collections and most of the
time the collections I've always just
kind of been like
I'm really disappointed with actually so
when she came out with this summer
collection I was like whoa she has to
myself I really like and that
includes the wet set I was shaken to the
core with this bad bitch I've used every
single color I'm just gonna swatch it
slowly so you guys have seen yeah Kylie
came out with blinding as
highlights blinding as the shades I
love the most is privacy please which of
this shade right here it's are very
pretty like golden champagne shade it's
so hard they're so reflective even in
the pan it's hard to see the camera will
pick it up right here I'm very impressed
with those guys I think that they're so
blinding so intense and they are a
creamy consistency they're very very
similar to the Stila the Stila
highlighters I feel kind of like putty
they feel very much like that they're a
wet powder you can like press your
finger in and it will dip it'll
dip it look yeah I think something about
that texture really gives you an intense
ass shine I would suggest putting this
on with a finger or with a sponge or
with a kabuki brush it does not go on
well with a normal highlighting brush it
just does not it does not pick up the
way you would want it to pick up but it
is blinding and if you guys get the
chance I have no idea if Kylie is coming
back with the website I have no idea if
our summer collection is coming back I
think that it should because honestly
it's a good ass palette however
this is $62 I think that $62 is so
 ridiculous the price is obscene
and the fact that this thing sold out
first it just goes to show that like her
company can do that and price that at
that point and anyone's gonna buy it so
I just think that it kind of sucks that
it's priced so high um
62 bucks or for highlighters I just
think that's Wow like it's I was shooken
shook him to the core but hey it has a
nice mirror it's built very very well
it's very sturdy the product works
fantastically actually at the price
point is a little obscene matches me and
last but definitely definitely not least
actually it could be my favorite of the
entire month is the Jaclyn hill palette
with more feet you guys
I traveled with this to VidCon and I
wore it every single day that I did
makeup bitch has gone in bitch has gone
 and on these Viking colors huh
I've always loved morph equality I've
always thought they had such great
quality for such a low price point
aren't they Tom Ford are they why sell
Beauty they're not their quality is not
as high as those products are but for
the price point that they are the
quality is amazing
it is I don't care what anyone
says I don't care what kind of hate I
get from anything with more feet I don't
give a bitch that quality is so
nice for such a low price point and no
one can knock it and no one can say it's
not alright
so when jacket came out with her palette
I was like okay this is gonna be great I
know it was going to but it's actually
better than the quality of other morphe
palettes I don't know what I did it I
have no idea but it is definitely higher
in quality the ingredients I believe are
the same ingredients but I think that
they're assembled differently
I saw this one post from this hating
makeup artist he's such a ass
I'm not gonna say his name because he
doesn't deserve it but I saw he posted
like saying that just basically ragging
on Jacqueline and more facing up the
ingredients were the same and the
quality is the same and that shouldn't
be charged a higher price point I'm like
yo homie if you actually knew anything
about makeup like you say you do you
would know that you have the same exact
ingredient Dec the same exact order what
matters is the amount of things that are
put into it when they are put into it
girl I digress all I'm saying is that I
think that this palette is absolutely
amazing and I think that for 35 shades
for 38 bucks and you can use look
 affiliates coat to save more
money on it it's a steal and I would
highly highly recommend you Jacqueline
hill and morphe palette I know it's
coming back and stop soon and so let's
talk right now but it's coming back soon
and I would HIGHLY highly suggest it and
we are now moving on to the
disappointments of June sweetheart okay
first things first let me just get this
out of the way because you guys might
have already seen a video of me talking
about this these are the magnetic lashes
by the brand one to lash I only have one
pair left in here two pairs
I honestly don't even know I don't know
where the other pair went I did a full
entire dedicated video on these lashes
they are $70 for two pairs of lashes
they are magnetic and they are the
smallest most plasticy ugliest looking
lashes I've ever worn not any candy and
is telling the truth guys but if you
guys want to see the video on how they
worked how they
reacted I will definitely leave and
linked it down below cuz it's just so
much better to see it than to talk about
it ii disappoint me other month is this
little guy this is the Makeup Forever
aqua color paint XL in the shade m16
which is a white it's actually the
eyeliner that I'm wearing today and I
don't think I shouldn't tell but a lot
of it is cracking falling off onto my
lashes mostly on this side it's just so
cracky so flaky and I'm really really
bummed about it because I really really
really wanted to absolutely love these
I'm actually wearing another one on my
lid as a primer just to try it out and
that worked totally fine it's just not
good for a liner for the white maybe you
can use it for like body paint or for
something else but for eyeliner I would
definitely not suggest this it's not
very good but the one I use as eye
primer was great so I'm gonna keep
testing them out to see what I think
about them but I just think personally
the white just didn't work for me and
it's currently not working for me right
now I'm frustrated and last but
certainly not least for the
disappointments is yes I feel kind of
bad for this my disappointment I really
do but hey you got to be honest you got
to be upfront and I was disappointed
this is the Kim kardashian-west beauty
contour and highlighting stick the
reason this is in my disappointments
guys is because I think that for the
amount of product you're getting which I
will show right here is all the project
inning on both sides for I believe it's
what $42 for contour stick and
highlighting stick and a little brush I
think that's so crazy
the packaging itself is really really
cheap I love the color of it I think the
color is really pretty and I love that
it's like a soft matte pink I think it's
beautiful but when it comes down to the
actual important stuff like the price
and if it works i think that the pricing
is a little too high for what you're
getting the product does it work it does
work
I wear the contour stick and it
definitely worked and it definitely
blended really nicely with the bristle
end of the brush of the little tool that
came with the bristle and it definitely
blended it nicely but the sponge side is
really really hard and super impractical
I really wanted it to work and I wanted
to love it but for the little
amount that you get for the high price
point I just don't think it's worth it
and that's why I'm disappointed and I'm
just putting in the price and like the
amount of product you're getting I'm not
disappointed in the actual product
itself I think it actually worked pretty
nicely on me and I'll definitely
continue to use it and that's it you
guys that's it for the entire video of
my june of favourites and
disappointments i'll because i'd fun
watching it i hope you guys enjoy these
