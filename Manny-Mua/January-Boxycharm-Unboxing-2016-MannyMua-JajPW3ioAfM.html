today's video is going to be my
boxycharm
unboxing video bring a sweater something
cold it is the January unboxing video I
haven't done an unboxing video for
boxycharm in like months I'm in the
process of pre filming right now because
I'm going out of town for half of
January and I'm like yo I didn't have as
many videos as I can
done that's where that went are you
 kidding me sorry I said a moment
I just saw something that I was looking
for and it was just another video that I
could be able to put up for you guys
because I'm out of time perhaps in
January I love the service and boxycharm
I think they're badass I discovered them
through kathleenlights cuz she does
Bakke charm videos for every single
month like she's dedicated she
does her every month I'm like props
to you bitch props to you because I
cannot do every month I mean I can but
it's just hard to remember actually when
tonight Woodforde them last year and I
met the owner and he's so cool super
laid back super chill and he just really
wants to create a subscription box
that's like good quality that's actually
gonna get you good like they
literally pay for items to get into
their boxes not just like it's not like
a free sample thing like they'll
literally pay for items to put in their
boxes because they wanted to have the
best box possible and I really
appreciate that if you're into those
services every month
I think Pocky charm is probably the best
one so I've received other ones at
boxycharm is by far my favorite one so
that's just my own opinion so going into
this video let's unbox this
hmm told him I was dead haha okay so we
have a baka charm eyes on 2016 Omega
this is the first month of the year
sure huh all eyes on your just 16 this
year's Pakistan resolution making
justice you seen the most charming yet
and it has all the products on the back
of this as usual as it usually does
let's sit at the end let's go to the
 box best things first biggest
thing here yo so the first thing I
grabbed out of the box was this I'm I'm
impressed I'm impressed
I'm not excited because I'm like oh my
god I'm gonna use all these brushes like
bring it right now I'm not excited
because of that I'm excited because you
get three brushes in the box each arm
box and usually I've seen them send
brushes vitals only one in a box and so
the fact that you get three in this one
I'm like super impressed
let's go helping them see the detail and
let's see the quality so these are from
the brand a revolution royal langnickel
Langan nickel lamb gin nickel what the

laying nickel I was adding an extra what
I what the there's three brushes
here this the detail hi shadow brush
professional pointed brush and precision
eye shadow detail brush so filling them
now like they're not bad they are not
bad brushes do I have brushes that I
like more than this of course I do
no tea no shade langnickel you're
getting a great value for only paying
twenty bucks for the boxycharm box and
you're getting three brushes in this
month that's really really cool to me
the ones I'll actually use realistically
are going to be these two the packing
brush and the pencil brush this one I
will not use this is just not a brush
that will be going into my crease I
don't like the quality the way this
feels I think the bristles are too rough
and I don't think it'll do to be
quite honest but in fact they're getting
three for the price of twenty bucks plus
more stuff in the box that is sick go
Bucky charm
this is the ardency Inn
oh excuse the out of me boxy Arjun
Singh and monster smooth right a
supercharged eyeliner that's a mouthful
and the shade
true-blue let's get you guys honestly
ardently in is like a high-end brand
it's inside Sephora the fact that
boxycharm has this and their box is like
I'm kind of shocked like it's like whoa
that's super cool you know to me like
shocked in a good way
let's watch the
that is gorgeous I would wear that my
eyes right now on my waterline I mean
I'm not going to because I'm makeup on
but I could I love the monster eyeliner
some urgency in Jacqueline is actually
the one that got me in to using the
ardency in the liners they're really
really nice very smooth the black one is
so black so creamy so smooth stays on
the waterline very nicely so the fact of
the boxycharm box had a monster ardency
and eyeliner in it that is sickening
okay what's next
this is the blink mascara amplified leg
MUSC ramp leg and helmet it Oh got it
the mascara amplified stop painting your
lashes too with them the does that
mean it's because it's an Adobe so it's
a little mascara as a nice wand it's a
very very fat thick one I'm excited to
try this out
I love getting mascaras mascaras is like
the one thing you just never have enough
of because you're always gonna run out
of mascaras you always gonna need more
so that's why I like getting mascaras
and things I know I just really like
mascaras even though I always wear false
lashes I've actually never tried
anything from the brand blink before
have you guys I don't even know never
tried them before but I'm excited to try
them out I'm sure I'm sure they're
sickening I'm sure it's sick so we'll
see how I like this one let's try out
and last but not least open is the hehe
revealed what revealed palettes 20
eyeshadow smokey by Coastal Scents looks
like this I like the background of it
how it's like it's smoky and like yeah
okay so it is an eyeshadow palette it
looks like this promising ass colors man
promising colors how do they swatch down
not as fit as I thought I thought was
any worse not gonna lie
sorry Coastal Scents I oh that one sucks
mmm Tom's not that bad okay so this is
more of a hit or miss for me so here's
three swatch right there I take a topi
pink color of gold and then like a flake
yes yellow I don't know about I don't
know about the yellow one
all of that so this is just a nice shot
of how it's a very basic eyeshadow
palette I'm assuming this is more for
beginners it's not gonna be like if
you're making enthusiasts that you just
make up all the time that has like urban
decay in to face and those kind of
shadows these are not gonna be the
shadows for you
realistically I probably won't be using
this very often how it's like this are
just not my thing I'm not really the
biggest fan of Coastal Scents and like
I'm just not I'm just like okay I'm sure
they have really good things like I just
haven't found anything that really
worked out for me that was like oh my
god like shockingly good I tried one of
the palettes before and it was not good
there was no pigmentation there was no
blend ability to it it was just like
chalkboard status so just not my thing
yeah so it's going to go into the box
time little thing is basically on the
back of the little fire that you get in
the beginning you get the four prices of
what they are so let's go and see what
everything is and what the prices are
first thing the blink mascara amplify
the full size it's full size by the way
full size all the items here are
full-size I just saw it right now so
price point of us is 26 bucks for that
mascara that's expensive coats lashes
with a glossy volumizing and extending
an application that forms tiny water
resistant tubes around the lashes very
cool it's just a mascara a nice mascara
that's gonna be water resistant so I'm
excited to try that out
I love mascara this next one is the
Coastal Scents revealed smoky full-size
$40 honey honey child love no no no
features 20 all new smoldering
eyeshadows and dramatic variety of hues
and textures I'm sorry but I don't think
that pal was worth $40 Holi kind of
shocked I'm most $20 at most 44 what
what for what 40 for one full I'm sorry
like it's me that gets me upset let me
just walk in sit down that gets me
 I'm sorry okay I feel like
they're charging you an arm and a leg
for for chalk that doesn't work for us
thank you so much next thing we move on
because core I get obsessed arts
flattering I use the wrong eye shadow
primer today and my eyeshadow is
creasing so the next item is the royal
and langnickel brush set they're full
size and that is $23 that I can see
being $23 that each brush is actually $8
those kind of brushes you can find at
like
Rite Aid and you know I mean like when
you go into like the little beauty
section they have those little brushes
and like those little like hard plastic
casings that's what it reminds me of
that's exactly what that little brush
set reminds me of so that's twenty three
dollars for full-size I can see that
being twenty three dollars
super stick that is inside this box and
then the artists E in Monster smooth
ride supercharged eyeliner is full-size
and that's $19 that is probably what I'm
the most excited for inside this box is
the monster eyeliner by ardency in the
fact that they even have that in the box
is super super awesome that is a
high-end brand and it's inside Sephora
and those eyeliners are not cheap
they're 19 bucks and their great quality
I'm so excited so let's add them up to
see how much it is total so the value of
the entire box is a hundred and nine
dollars when you only pay 21 I think
that's so crazy amazing what I think
it's awesome I truly do believe in boxes
you're marking boxycharm of all these
subscription service boxes I think this
one is the best but I mean you saw the
products don't take my word for I mean
you saw the price the proof is in the
pudding the proof is in the pudding yeah
that's if my entire unboxing video happy
eyes have fun watching it I love doing

like I'm just seeing down and talking to
you guys and opening like a
package with you guys and I think that's
really really fun you guys want to be
