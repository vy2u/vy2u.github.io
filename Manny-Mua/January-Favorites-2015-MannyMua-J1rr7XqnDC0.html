really appreciate it this was like best
selfie stick I've ever seen of all the
brands cuz I've seen a couple you know
this isn't just like this let me go buy
this at CVS like this is a nice one huh
of course I'll leave a link down below
but this was a really nice one and it's
extremely sturdy and I love that it
swivels here like it's just this is a
good one dude when they email me to like
send me one I was like sure go ahead
like sent me but I was thinking I was
like I don't want to give a bad one
well if it's like little plastic and
shitty
but it's not it's bomb so thank you so
much - mini suit again I really preciate
from you guys this is like a legit ass
thing
I'm all week anything little me
do some skincare bird yeah so first part
about skincare stuff I went to Sephora
when I was in LA and I was just picking
up some other things that I of course I
used to use all time when I was at
Sephora I picked up my soap &amp;amp; Glory hand
food which is basically a hand
moisturizer do you guys this is doing
cuz I can't this stuff is so good like
its first of all it smells amazing soap
&amp;amp; Glory is a brand that's ones like
Sephora and it is an extremely extremely
hydrating body buttery type brand and so
what I love about this hit the head food
that dummy wrong like if you do that
like kind of film that like greasy film
for like about a minute and then it
soaks into your skin so and it really
really really hydrates me I have I'm not
gonna lie I have like kind of like soft
hands like I think that like for a Judah
has pretty soft like dainty hands I'm
just like you know rolling really dainty
but the problem is is I have like a dry
patch like like right here like not even
a dry patch just like a little the dry
areas so I use the hand food to really
just keep me hydrated in this is
probably the one of the best 10
moisturizers that I've ever use and I
also you like to use it on my ankles as
well because it's so densely hydrating
it's extremely thick and has shea butter
macadamia oil and marshmallow I had no
idea it's amazing check it out it's olds
like Sephora thing I got this for
literally like eight bucks cause it's
like the mini version and like check out
the self checkout thing love and then
also my second one for the skin carry
type thing is the Smith cemented Rose
lip balm which looks like this it's this
little tin this is like a brand new when
I would open it yet because I'm so I
mean other one binding a refill you guys
this lip balm
oh good I'm getting pissed at myself
it's so good you know like seriously
though like this Lebon is so amazing it
has a minty smell minty feeling but it
doesn't like give you that stinging like
mint feeling and it has let's see what
it has it's a lip balm that has rose
extract in it which is extremely
extremely good for the lips and good for
the skin it's very very hydrating it's
my favorite lip balm I've ever used in
my entire life I swear this I used to
use it at Sephora all the time when I
worked there and I bought like a billion
of them it's only like 7 or 8 bucks so
good if you guys can check it out it
kind of gives you like a glossy finish
like I'm not gonna lie cuz you like a
little bit of like a glossy film but I
can handle that one this like as good as
it is it's absolutely amazing I'm sure a
lot you guys will know about this but
Smith's midget Rose lip balm they have a
couple kinds but I specifically like the
minted Rose lip balm this is my favorite
one over the 3 long my next one is the
Sephora eye makeup remover this one like
the one that's like the blue and the
like thing in it when I used to work
there guys
I was hellish it like weren't
like this you see this stuff takes off
everything it takes off everything and
it's just it's like 10 it's 10 bucks I
think this is the one that's 10 bucks
but what I love about this one so much
is that it has like no like parabens are
no scent to it so it's not gonna be as
intense on the eyes like a lot of other
removers are it doesn't really leave you
that'sthat's oily film that a lot of
other oil removers do if you guys could
I was checking it out
this is a four brand waterproof eye
makeup remover like it literally takes
up everything he's with my benefit
they're real it takes off my waterproof
it takes off everything like shockingly
so if I had a go get a new one because I
was out of it and I was like why haven't
I talked about this in my channel this
is like my life so I had it really I had
a bitch in it because this is on
and poppin like it's bum I just like
open it get it up to shooting and hold
it for like 5 seconds 10 seconds 10
seconds bitch is gone it's except
everything you guys will not be
disappointed
I'm telling you edit take off everything
I found you shouldn't I've been loving
me Celine is the Tarte Amazonian clay
full coverage foundation it's the one
I'm wearing right now I'm in color fair
light honey
and what I love about this foundation is
that it's non comedogenic paraben free
fragrance free chart goes by the motto
high-performance necros and it's a
basically tart as a all-natural brand
that's one insight support as well I
mean I worked at Sephora I used to go to
tart all the time special people that
needed so much like a lot of coverage
but are extremely extremely sensitive
this is gonna be great for you guys this
foundation is so good it gives you full
coverage very very very buildable but
you can meet you can make it like medium
to fool I wouldn't say this is really
that sheer unless you get something you
mix it with something it gives you a
kind of matte finish I could add some
more in the matte side it's nothing more
on the matte side and you know what I
love about it too is just that it
doesn't I don't feel like it clogs my
pores it doesn't settle into my fine
lines and wrinkles and it doesn't feel
like what I'm wearing it I'm wearing
like a ton of makeup so
that's what I love about this foundation
so much as well if you need a high
coverage foundation and you have combo
skin like like normal to combo skin I
would definitely try this guy out I'm
oily and it's and it still works for me
I'm like I'm like combo oily and it's
the worst to me so it looks really
really really well it's extremely
hydrating and it's bomb
it's bomb don't drink let's
check out another Tarte item that I've
been living that's actually what I'm
wearing on my eyes right now
the tartlet palette by tour this is what
it looks like it has 12 colors and it's
absolutely amazing every color is
extremely extremely pigmented as what
I'm wearing on my eyes today you know if
you guys want of course let me know in
the comments below if you guys want me
to do a tutorial on this look I can't
it's pretty easy to do like a purple
smokey eye like cool toned purple smokey
eye I can do it I got you guys if you
want the reason why I love it is because
I love palettes I have only match
shadows didn't have enough that make
sense but and so what I love about this
is that this can be your transitions for
everything you can use it all together
you can use it with other colors like it
has every color in here like all the way
from like your cool to warm to Purple's
to transitions as to Gray's like it has
everything so if you guys need a big all
mats that are really high quality that
you can use for literally everything
like I can use this palette with
everything else at home you don't mean
so that's what I like how it's like that
I can use with absolutely everything and
like interchange them so yeah I don't
check out the tartlet palette I'm not
sure exactly how much it is I'll leave a
link down below of course but this
palette is so oh okay that's you know in
love
mmm-hmm love it tartlet palette sold
also like Sephora
let's do one another Sephora thing I'm
like going Sephora crazy right now huh
the highlighter I'm wearing right now
how many guys can see is like it's a
gold tone highlight he's actually from
Sephora it's my Sephora brand it's their
micro smooth stardust powder it looks
like this in zero one when I worked at
Sephora I wore this every single
time I worked there because it looks
exactly like NARS albatross NARS has an
extremely popular highlight called
albatross and it's a white that gives
you a gold reflect this is exactly that
it's um don't get wrong this isn't as
smooth and silky as the NARS one it's
not but it's a good dupe for it
like this looks like I'm wearing the
NARS albatross it just it does you know
it gives you like it does such a
beautiful gold reflect don't you guys
can see that but it's amazing it's
actually amazing I'm wearing on my
cheeks right now and that's all wearing
as my highlight and it's like 13 bucks
like you cannot beat that quality that
you're getting I'm not the biggest fan
of Sephora brand products like I'm not
like when I worked at there the worth I
never was there except for this I love
this I love it and it's so easy for you
guys to get a hold of like then go in
and after you can see the micro smooth
powders by Sephora brand and they'll
show you and there's two of them
this was my favorite the cool thing
about though is that it reflects gold so
even girls that are medium to darker in
complexion can use this and it still
won't look ashy you know I mean I feel
like silver that leaders have a lot of
silver in them will look a little ashy
on darker tones but this one says this
one has gold in it kind of cancels it
out in the way of not looking Ashley so
I don't think I'll try this out it's
only 13 bucks and it's bomb it's bomb
we're winding down I didn't put a lot in
this I don't belong in this okay so
the mascara I've been using for the past
like two months and I've been living for
is the white sell babydoll mascara I
know everyone raised about this mascara
for good reason
it is amazing no seriously this mascara
is so me thinking of one other right is
they brush looks like this look like I'm
on and the reason why I like the brush
so much is because it really separates
your lashes it gives your individual
lashes fullness and it really can lift
up the lash and it doesn't drop the lash
down you know I mean like a lot of
mascaras will make your blushes heavy
this one doesn't make my lashes heavy at
all and it really fans out all my lashes
and it separates them I don't like
clumpy lashes so if you're internet the
clumpy lashes
like really full look this isn't really
the mascara for you but for me I
absolutely love it so much that I have
like the mini baby one so I need to go
get the full and because it's so so good
so good like it's super black flares out
my lashes gives me fullness where I
don't have it like it's just
turned to turn up turn it so the first
look price I'm gonna talk about are the
Anasazi Buffy Hills liquid lipsticks I
mean they really don't need like really
much talking or explanation because I
did a whole video on them I'll leave a
link down below if you guys want to see
a swatch on 19 Obama and I give you like
a little down low on the lipsticks so
you're interested I'll go and link that
down below but I just want to pick my
three favorite colors that they have and
the right here
the first favorite is pure Hollywood
then Heather's then lovely I'll go ahead
and swatch them on my hand right now
Heather's first my favorite is lovely
lovely is like my absolute favorite - my
favorite color of like the whole month
is what they look like so it goes
Heather's lovely and pure Hollywood
those are my three favorites of the
month I've been using these the most um
pure Hollywood is this very beautiful
beige II a nude basically it has like
not not too much pink in it as a very
beige undertone so the color I'm wearing
right now I'm wearing just pure
Hollywood and in the middle one is
lovely which is a very pinky nude now I
absolutely love lovelies like my
favorite color like I wear that all
throw I'm at so I absolutely love it it
has like a like whitish pink to it and
then Heather's is the basically a deep
dark maroon and I absolutely love these
three colors I love the finish and I
love the formula these lipsticks so much
they're very creamy and they give you a
lot of dry time to put on so when you
put them on you type them on their full
pigment full 100% pigment so I come on
you get like a good 30 seconds till they
started to dry completely so I love that
oh that's so much about these bad boys
though I'm really into this like this
liquid lipstick cake great in house so I
would definitely check out the Anasazi
Buffy Hills
liquid lipsticks they're so good
 damn another liquid lipstick
that I've been living for literally
living for is the Galactic starlit lip
paint I wore this in my how to overdraw
your lips video I wore this all the time
on my
like I'm obsessed this lip paint but
this is what star that looks like it's
as beautiful just warm brownie pink I
love it I love it I love it I love it I
love it I love it I love starlet it's
like one of my favorite colors of life
right now you know what I like about the
lip paints is that when you swipe them
and they dry they don't dry like super
super super 100 sentiment like they like
the reason they're called it paints is
because when you swipe them on this your
skin you can kind of do a lot of pigment
or a little bit of pigment so you can
swipe them you can put another layer on
and or another layer on to get like full
pigment but if not you want to like a
kind of a wash of color you can just dab
it on and it's gonna be green it's gonna
drag Mac on you just like all the other
ones do so I really like these matte
lipsticks right now these are the ones
I've been gagging for so girl lactic and
also doodles okay John and then last but
not least my last night product of the
month is the berry smoothie new lipstick
by Jorah cosmetics
yeah well the new one gonna the
protein I'll swipe it next to everything
else it's right here so this is what it
looks like it's this purple pink with a
brown undertone in it and it leaves you
a satin finish it doesn't dry matte like
some of the other ones like 1995 or nude
or anything like that this one gives you
more moisture but I love this color so
much you guys know that these are like
my kind of tones you know I love these
kinds of tones and some you know I
think that would be beautiful until
looks so good on with so many people
because it has those different
undertones that has like the pink the
purple the brown and it would look good
from a pale girls all the way up to like
darker skin girls there's no different
such a universal color code of course
I'll leave my like links and codes down
below and guess you guys are interested
in trying it out I mean you don't have
to of course you're not to leave you're
not to listen to me and like use my
codes you can like use some other codes
like it no matter oh I just want you
