so today was going to be a review and
swatch of the new Jeffrey start liquid
lipsticks I have all eight of them right
now the ones that he has like launched
so I got tons of requests to do a kind
of like review on them from you guys in
my favorites video so I decided that I
was going to do a little review on them
because you guys were like bitch you
better really beat that right now
and I want to see swatches a little too
so I was like you know what okay I'm
gonna go and do that for you guys yeah
so enjoy it if you guys like this kind
of video don't watch it
especially because I have lipstick on my
little real cute if you guys
deal with craft my channel do that but
yeah I will get you guys to the video
and I will see you soon good bye ping
everybody finger bang so the first one
we're gonna do is celebrity skin it is a
very nude beige color it's extremely
nude though it has a lot of gray tones
to it so it's not like a normal nude
where it's very like pinky much more on
the cool tone side so this is what it
looks like it's beautiful the color is
absolutely beautiful it's it's a
gorgeous cool tone BG gray it should
kind of nude because what this looks
like
okay next one what is the new so nice
we're gonna do is clean supreme which is
basically a very lavender pink that's
like the best I can describe it and it's
a very purple toned pink so this is what
Queens supreme looks like I feel like
I'm it's my peatland a little bit yellow
because it has that purple tone to it
you know it's very pretty for some runs
very great for the spring it's a very
pastel lavender pink when it goes on I
feel like it just a little bit a little
bit patchy so I like to do two layers of
this one just to take away any of the
pettiness the light of the color usually
the more patchy looks don't like to do
two layers of this one let's go over to
dry um and then there you go it's drying
down Mac now so this is what it looks
like with two layers on I like it I
really like I think it's really pretty
Barbie pinky color
okay cool so the next one is going to be
7:14 which is this bright ass coral neon
coral color its ho sik this is the one I
feel I give them as patchy of all of
them this is definitely a two-layered
color it's a B you take full bright ass
coral like I don't even know how else to
explain it
it's so slimy this is so spring this is
so summer I fell you need to get two
layers with this one to get the most
pigmentation out of it to get like the
true color of like what it is inside the
bottle but I think it's an absolutely
beautiful color that I just wish it was
more pigmented right away like soon as I
swiped it I want it to be like full
pigment right away like the other colors
are I mean not everyone loves every
single lipstick from every single brand
so I think that this color is absolutely
beautiful
you just need two layers of it so yeah
okay the next one is going to be prom
night which is this hot-ass pink hot
pink hot to like if so pretty
what's going to swatch so many bad so
this color is a very hot pink bass on
some fuchsia to it so it's like a
fuchsia happy very pigmented right away
so this one I really do love my penis's
color is absolutely gonna be unbeautiful
and literally everyone people from like
light complexion hallway to like deeper
complexion I think will look absolutely
beautiful on this especially depending
on the lip liner use it with I'm not
using lip liners with them right now
because I'm doing so many swatches of
all II to them and I'm like I don't need
a lip line right now I just doll I think
this color is absolutely love it this is
and prominent okay next one is going to
be I'm royalty you take a lavender
purple this color I feel only needs one
layer if this is my least favorite of
all the colors if you're into the like
the heroine from Mac and that kind of a
purpley tone you'll really like that I'm
royalty but I don't really like it
because I feel like it makes you look
really yellow and I hate that I hate
that myself
kara I think the pigmentation of it is
beautiful it's very pigmented you Lenny
one layer and it's like boom pigment
done
really good super good it's not my kind
of thing it's not my kind of color
actually it's very like Barney purple
and I'm not really into Barney purple
for my lips
okay next color which could possibly be
like my number one come on cast is Red
Rum which is like a deep red true red
color
die die
forgive my messy application it's much
more of a neutral red to me it's not too
orange in tone it's not too bluish in
tone I think this is just a very good
neutral red color that will look good on
so many different people everyone will
look good in this run yeah sickening
this is it red rug next is actually
another one my favorites this is unicorn
blood doc I just love saying you don't
let in that way so this is unicorn but
this is a very deep maroon good blood
broom
I would say that's how I would explain
unicorn blood gonna put it on the first
white it my favorite wouldn't kill me
it's late then this bitch is giving me
life in prison realness
I wore this in my last videos I think
was my favorites the fact that it's
called unicorn blood is so accurate this
color is so stunning it's one one layer
is all you need it's so pigmented right
away pigment boom and it's very deep and
rich in color it's very warm so I really
like that it's like a very warm maroon
color it's like a cool Tom maroon it's
very warm and I think it's absolutely
there's like my top three of his eight
this is like top three for sure
okay now last but definitely definitely
not Louise weirdo which is a pitch you
met black pitch rabbi the Sun is
 with my lightning look it's my
winner okay so this black is so
pigmented right away I love it it's not
like a freaking like let me just build
this black this is black okay now this
is what weirdo looks like it is a very
matte black lipstick I think this color
is so freakin sick I love black lipstick
and I wear I wish I could wear it more I
just think it's a sick color and I think
that people that wear black lipstick out
in their daytime are so brave and I
think they're so cool and I think that
they should freaking be applied for
wearing black lipstick all the time cuz
it looks sick I think I feel so like
 in the craft with my little moon
necklace to wear down it's not for the
review part this is the review part of
the lipstick it just gonna be a quick
short review for you guys just things
that I feel like are crucial and things
you should know this matte formula it
reminds me the most of the Kat Von D
liquid lipsticks but a little bit more
liquidy than the Kat Von D ones are the
lasting power it reminds me the Kat Von
D one's a little bit longer lasting than
Anasazi ones they are also a little bit
more drying than them as well you can
have your cake and eat it too if you
would want a matte lipstick that dries
down on the lips that's extremely long
where it will be drying because it just
needs to cling onto the lips take out
all the moisture basically on your lips
and just like really stain just so you
guys know for reference it's extremely
hard to create a long wear lipstick that
dries matte that doesn't dry out your
lips that much because the fact that
it's drying matte it is really clinging
on to the lips and it's not leaving any
room for moisture at all of course I'd
love you guys know that but just for
those of you who don't know that you get
point 19 fluid ounces of product in this
which is a good amount of product at me
is a liquid lipstick it's pretty good I
love the packaging it's just cute little
just see-through bottle like my cab
dingy and it clicks then dad the
applicator is a doe foot applicator but
it is the biggest doe foot applicator
I've ever singing it's huge it's like
this is like the actual foot of a doe
this bitch is huge so watch is very
pigmented I think that's some of them
are a lot more pigmented and rich in
color than other ones are
I go in I explain it inside my swatches
which ones I think are more pigmented in
which was I think are less pigmented I
wish that the formulation was more
similar throughout because I feel like
due to the fact that some colors are
more pigmented I feel like some lasts
longer are the lips and others of his do
yeah so some lipsticks require two
layers and some require just one I think
that the lipsticks are really really
really great I think they're either $18
per the shitty thing about them is that
you can tell you can't buy a month
before you can buy and let me see it has
to be the jeffree star cosmetics website
and i believe that they're all sold out
right now I have no honestly I don't
even know those bitches sell out so fast
but you can sign up for a mailer I was
dropping this these were all sent to me
all the liquid lipsticks were sent to me
but of course I'm not getting paid to
talk about this video I'm doing it
because a lot of you guys asked for me
to swatch them all and just to show you
guys and do a quick little review of
them and just give you my thoughts and
it pains on the lipsticks I do think
that they're absolutely amazing they're
one of the best abilities I've ever
tried so I think you guys should
definitely check them out hopefully
they'll be getting in stock more and if
not I would definitely sign up for the
mailer because they send you emails of
Windus colors that you are wanting are
in stock again so definitely check that
out so yeah that was it for the video
hopefully you guys enjoyed this kind of
swatch kind of video I also was gonna
plan on doing a top 10 lip gloss by on a
sausage Beverly Hills so yeah if you
guys are still interested in a lip gloss
review from Anasazi let me Hills I would
definitely do that for you guys if not -
