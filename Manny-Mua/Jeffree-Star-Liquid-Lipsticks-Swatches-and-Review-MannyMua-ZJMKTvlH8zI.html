so x video is going to be a review and
swatch of the new Jeffy started liquid
lipsticks I have all eight of them right
now the ones that he has like launched
so I got tons of requests to do a kind
of like review on them from you guys in
my favorites video so I decided I was
going to do a little review on them
because you guys were like bitch you
better really be that shit right now and
I want to see swatches a little too so I
was like you know what okay I'm gonna go
and do that for you guys yeah so enjoy
it if you guys like this kind of video
don't fuckin watch it especially because
I have lipstick on my little real
fucking cute if you guys do subscribe to
my channel do that but yeah I will get
you guys to the video and I will see you
soon good bye finger by finger bye so
first one we're going to do is celebrity
skin it is a very nude beige color it's
extremely nude though it has a lot of
great tones to it si it's not like a
normal nude where it's very like pinky
much more on the cool tone side so this
is what it looks like it's beautiful the
color is absolutely beautiful it's just
a gorgeous cool tone busy gray it's kind
of nude is what this looks like okay
next one what is the name well so this
we're going to do is clean supreme which
is basically a very lavender pink that's
like the best I can describe and it's a
very purple toned pink so this is what
Queens supreme looks like I feel like it
makes my teeth like a little bit yellow
because it has that purple tone to it
you know it's very pretty fit summer is
very great for the spring it's a very
pesto lavender pink when it goes on I
feel like it just a little bit a little
bit patchy so I like to do two layers of
this one just to take away any of the
patchiness the light of the color
usually the more patchy looks don't like
do two layers of this one let's go over
to dry um and then then I go it's drying
down Matt now so this is what it looks
like with two layers on I like it I
really like I think it's really pretty
barbie pinky color
okay cool so the next one is going to be
7:14 which is this bright ass coral neon
coral color it's ho sick
this is the one I feel like is the most
patchy of all of them this is definitely
a two-layered color
it's a beautiful bright ass coral like I
don't even know how else to explain it
it's so stunning a little info over I
mean this is so spring this is so summer
I feel like you need to get two layers
with this one to get the most
pigmentation out of it to get like the
true color of like what it is inside the
bottle but I think it's an absolutely
beautiful color that I just wish it was
more pigmented right away like soon as I
swiped it I want it to be like full
pigment right away like the other colors
are I mean not everyone loves every
single up stick from every single brand
so I think that this color is absolutely
beautiful
you just needed two layers of it so yeah
okay the next one is going to be prom
night which is this hot-ass pink hot
pink hot it look like it's so pretty
what's going to watch my shit oh man
laughs solve anything so this color is a
very hot pink battled some fuchsia to it
so it's like a fuchsia hoppy very
pigmented right away so this one I
really do love my thing is color is
absolutely gonna be a beautiful one
literally everyone people from like
light complexion hallway to like deeper
complexion I think will look absolutely
beautiful on this especially with like
depending on the lip liner use it with
I'm not using lip liners with them right
now because I'm doing so many swatches
of all eight of them and I'm like I
don't need a lip line right now I just
don't I think this color is absolutely
angels we fuckin love it this is an
primate okay next one is going to be I'm
royalty take a lavender purple this
color I feel only needs one layer if
this is my least favorite of all colors
fewer into the like the heroine from Mac
and that kind of like purpley tone
you'll really like that I'm royalty but
I don't really like it because I feel
like a Miss which she look really yellow
and I hate that fucking hate that shame
is Issa kara I think the pigmentation of
it is beautiful
it's very pigmented you only need one
layer and it's like boom pigment done
cat cut really good super good it's not
my kind of thing it's not my kind of
color actually it's very like Barney
purple and I'm not really into Barney
purple for my lips
okay next color which could possibly be
like my number one my mom's test is Red
Rum which is like deep red true red
color dye dye forget my messy
application it's much more of a neutral
red to me it's not too orange in tone
it's not too bluish in tone I think this
is just a very good neutral red color
that will look good on so many different
people everyone will look good in this
red yeah sickening this is it red rug
next is actually another one my
favorites this is unicorn blood doc I
just love saying you know calm blood in
that way so this is unicorn but this is
a very deep maroon - Blood Moon I would
say that's how I would explain unicorn
blood go and do it on the first wipe it
my favorite one kill me Slade dead this
bitch is giving me life in prison
realness I wore this in my last videos I
think was my favorites the fact that
it's called unicorn blood is so accurate
this color is so stunning it's one one
layer is all you need it's so pigmented
right away pigment boom and it's very
deep and rich in color it's very warm so
I really like that it's like a very warm
maroon color it's like cool Tom maroon
it's very warm and I think it's
absolutely
like my top three it was eight this is
like top three for sure okay now last
but definitely definitely not least
weirdo which is a pitch Matt black pitch
rabbi the fucking Sun is fucking with my
lighting look he makes my letter okay so
this black is so pigmented right away I
love it it's not like a freaking like
let me just build this black this is
black oh okay now this is what weirdo
looks like it is a very matte black
lipstick I think this color is so
freakin sick I love black lipstick and I
wear I wish I could wear it more I just
think it's a sick color and I think that
people that wear black lipstick out and
their daytime are so brave and I think
they're so cool I think that they should
friggin be applied for wearing black
lipstick all the time because it looks
sick I think I feel so like fucking the
crafts with my little moon necklace - OH
weirdo it goes not for the review part
this is the review part of the lipstick
it just gonna be a quick short review
for you guys just things that I feel
like are crucial and things you should
know this matte formula is reminds me
the most of the Kat Von D liquid
lipsticks but a little bit more liquidy
than the Kat Von D ones are the lasting
power reminds me the Kat Von D ones a
little bit longer lasting anasazi ones
they are also a little bit more drying
than them as well you can have your cake
and eat it too if you want a matte
lipstick that dries down on the lips
that's extremely long where it will be
drying because it just needs to cling
onto the lips take out all the moisture
basically of your lips and just like
really stain just so you guys know for
reference it's extremely hard to create
a long wear lipstick that dries matte
that doesn't dry out your lips that much
because the fact that it's drying matte
it is really clinging onto the lips and
it's not leaving any room for moisture
at all of course I love you guys know
that but just for those of you who don't
know that you get point 19 fluid ounces
of product in this which is a good
amount of product me is a liquid
lipstick it's pretty good I love the
packaging it's just cute little just
see-through bottle like packaging and it
clicks then then the applicator is a doe
foot applicator but it is the biggest
bill foot applicator I've ever singing
it's huge it's like this is like the
actual foot of a doe this bitch is huge
so watch is very pigmented I think that
some of them are a lot more pigmented
and rich in color than other ones are I
go and I explain
inside my swatches which was I think are
more pigmented in which was I think are
less pigmented I wish that the
formulation was more similar throughout
because I feel like due to the fact that
some colors are more pigmented I feel
like some lasts longer on the lips and
others of his do yeah so some lipsticks
require two layers and some require just
one I think that the lipsticks are
really really really great I think
they're either $18 per the shitty thing
about them is that you can tell you
can't buy one before you can buy a mummy
see it has to be the jeffree star
cosmetics website and i believe that
they're all sold out right now I have no
honesty I don't even know those bitches
sell out so fast but you can sign up for
a mailer how much traffic these were all
sent to me all the liquid lipsticks were
sent to me but of course I'm not getting
paid to talk about this video I'm doing
it because a lot of you guys asked for
me to swatch them all um and just to
show you guys to do a quick little
review of them and just give you my
thoughts into pains on the lipsticks I
do think that they're absolutely amazing
they're one of the best level of things
I've ever tried so I think you guys
should definitely check them out
hopefully they'll be getting in stock
more and if not I would definitely send
it for the mailer because they send you
emails of when this colors that you are
wanting art and stuff again so
definitely check that out so yeah that
was it for the video hopefully you guys
enjoyed this kind of swatch kind of
video I also was gonna plan on doing a
top 10 lip gloss by on a sausage Beverly
Hills so yeah if you guys are still
interested in a lip gloss review from
Anasazi Beverly Hills I would definitely
do that for you guys if not toggle I
don't give a fuck if it's for you guys I

great one I do if you guys are please
