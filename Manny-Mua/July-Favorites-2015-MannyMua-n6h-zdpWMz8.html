I just feel like I've been gone for so
long I just want to talk to you guys if
you know what I mean so yeah if you guys

opinion well if you guys do you like

please like this video and subscribe to
my channel if you aren't already how it
really appreciate it and yeah so it's
gonna get started with his favorites cuz
do it is
okay the my first favourites of the July
month is obviously it has to be this
like I just can't help it
it is my collaboration with drawer
cosmetics it is serenity I have been
getting so much love and support with
this color I've been getting literally
like thousands of photos thousands of
photos of people like wearing it and
saying that how much they love it how
much they love the formula how much they
love the color it's been such an amazing
month and you guys have been saying how
much you guys love it and it means so
much to me i 100% gave my all in this
collaboration and i really truly believe
this product is so amazing and I hope
all of you guys do too I'm actually
wearing it as my base color and then I
put a new lipstick on top of this like
the Sunday after VidCon I was at Sephora
and I was with Patrick and I was like
snapping that I was at Sephora and I
mean like literally it turned into a
mini meeting great it was like v we like
literally met like 50 people it was
crazy and I was like oh my god like
people were just shoving up to the
support that we're at and literally like
maybe like seven out of the 50 we're
wearing certainty and it was just like
such a huge like holy crap you guys are
wearing my color you know it means so it
was just so just shocking like moment
for me and I was so happy and I felt so
blessed to be in that situation and I
was just I was so happy and just I was
dying
hey I love you guys also have noticed
and have been tweeting me about the
photo that comes with this was like a
little postcard that comes with it
that's my face and it's a little like
bio of serenity they only ordered 5,000
of those so that they blow out the first
like two days of serenity if you didn't
buy it like the first couple days that
serenity was launched then you probably
didn't get it but I was talking to our
cosmetics and I asked them I was like
are we gonna be creating more cards
because I think the cards are really
cool and I think it's such a cool like
way to connect my following you know
what I mean like you guys get a little
card with my name on it and my face on
and with serenity so they aren't
creating more so if you do buy it today
today is Friday they told me that
they're gonna be getting more stuff
today
so if you guys do buy it today you guys
will probably get a card so they're
creating more it was just a cool little
like PR card billing made 5,000 that was
the plan that wasn't her that was gonna
be any more I didn't know how many that
they were making in general but because
people like to the cards so much they're
creating more so don't even worry about
it if I'm sorry for those of you
received it and didn't get a card I do
apologize like I didn't know when we go
right now or anything like that so
please forgive me on that situation but
if you guys aren't arresting serenity
I'll leave codes and stuff like that
down below the code Manning anyway will
give you thirty five percent off of it
and free shipping so
serenity so good I'm just so happy you
guys like it just makes my heart just
happy you know so thank you for loving
it too so the first things first is the
mask of Magnum minty by lush so
basically this is a mask it's a face and
body mask packed with peppermint
Kalen and scrubby head Dookie beans for
deeply cleansed skin this is what it
looks like obviously like gone through
so much of it I've been using for the
past two months actually it's one of my
favorite masks I've never tried it it's
so fresh it has peppermint it so I was
like that tingly cooling sensation to it
it's so ridiculously nice it is very
deeply cleansing though so you want to
use a once to twice a week like top like
twice max because it is very deeply
cleansing but honestly is one of my
favorite masks ever use you put it all
over your all over your face you wait
like 10 minutes you take it off and you
can literally feel how cleansed and how
nice your skin feels it feels so much
more plump and so much more clean
because it does take off the dead skin
on your surface of your skin so mask the
Magnum minty I don't know if lush gives
up samples but if they do how doesn't
try out the mask of Magnum in tea or I
get the smaller size of it this is the
small one and I said I'm shocked at how
much I like it because I never even like
started using lush until recently and
now I'm like obsessed next I just have
to talk about this because I died a
thousand riyals
it is the melt stacks like the melt
shadow stacks so they look like there's
the dark matter stack and the loves that
lovesick stack weight that right
basically there i shadow czar those
stacks of shadows I've showed you guys
this in the melt lipstick swatch video
that I did recently it's like their
little stacks and you got a swivel arm
and the cutest little packaging you can
like maneuver them to be that like
there's a super queue there melt shadows
are absolutely amazing I think the
quality is so they're they're very
blendable they're very creamy they don't
have a lot of pickup so I really like
that about them as well
and I just think the great shadows these
are so expensive that like like so
expensive like I think one of these is
like 45 bucks it's only for shadows I
mean you do get a lot it's like a big
pan but it's still like 45 bucks and
that's like oh like in my heart like
nice like that nice there so like list
combined is like $90 for eight colors
like that is so high like the
most out pay for like eight to nine
colors is around like 45 like 45 to 50
bucks you know what I mean like and
that's what like good ass quality like
with like nine colors 45 bucks that's
good because like five bucks a shadow
you know this is like so expensive I
think it has to do a a lot with the
packaging the packaging is so badass but
the quality is very much there and I'm
actually wearing the dark matter stack
on my eyes right now if you guys want to
see it a tutorial on this look let me
know I think it's a really pretty look
kind of dramatic and like really crazy
but I think it's super badass so like
this video or comment down below if you
guys do want to see it and if I notice
there's a lot of likes I don't know it's
cuz you wanted to authorial on the
middle so you know I'll definitely film
this look but I think the MEP shadows
are great they have such a good quality
to them and I'm like soap into them
right now like I'm so into them else
it's just good it's been you
know next is a cheaper item he ain't
cheap right um so this is the Real
Techniques sponge why would I not on the
Real Techniques sponge bandwagon when
everyone else was on it this is probably
like the closest dupe to a Beauty
Blender I've ever found was this and
honestly like I don't know if I like
this one better I like the Beauty
Blender one more like this is only like
five or six bucks the beauty blenders 20
this expands this is so soft honestly
like if you're looking for a good do for
the beauty blender and you want it to be
not so expensive
check out the Real Techniques sponge it
is it is so shockingly good Patrick was
gonna talk about it and he's like you
need to try there to a picnic sponge
like you might even like it better
because you like the beauty blender so
much I do I was like I okay oh my it's
like bought it and I was shocked I have
not stopped using this haven't even
touched my beauty butter since I bought
this it's really really good that's why
it's so disgustingly dirty this is the
true color of it right there
this is me it's great I think you guys
should definitely try it out the Real
Techniques Beauty Blender sponge serious
serious dupe at ease in my opinion
that's just my humble opinion yeah
the next is a little brush so I'm gonna
go talk about being more feet M 501
this little brush is so perfect for
highlighting okay so I think I thought
Jacqueline was the one that really got
this little bad boy like a rolling she
wasn't like strip first started talking
about the 501 and how great the fiber
one is at giving you the perfect amount
of highlight the perfect amount of
control for the highlights so if you
guys see people talk about the 501 I'm
pretty sure to go the jugglin
she wasn't really started the 501 crazy
I feel and honestly I'm jumping on that
crazy and I approve because this is
brushing seriously it's like bed cooler
with it don't look at it I think this
brush is great I think it's a beautiful
highlighting brush it's so good
precise highlight and packing on enough
color so you can get a really intense
highlight without going too overboard or
anything like that I hope that they are
in stock I'm not sure if they're in
stock right now I'm just talking about
because it really was one of my
favorites for the month so I don't know
if it's install coffee it is and if it
is of course link it down below with a
coupon code with more for you I am a
morphe affiliate you guys know this a
lot of you guys know this and so I love
you guys have supported me and I've used
my codes and you guys seem ten percent
so I do wanna say again thank you guys
have ever used my code in more feet
inside the store or online thank you
guys so much so check out the final one
it's easily one of my favorite
highlighting brushes I've ever used it's
so good it's going to talk about England
back to England to Inglot
so the English 77 liner everyone in
their mother everyone in their month
have talked about the Inglot 77 liner
because of the fact that it is seriously
like budge proof you put this bitch on
it is not coming off you can use like an
oil make approver and it's hard to take
off it is seriously like so good
especially me because I have a kind of
greasy lids and I have a hooded lid what
I noticed with this one is that it
doesn't transfer on my crease when I'm
wearing it so that's what I like about
it so much and I've been using it
non-stop 77 Winer if you guys have an
angle at around you like try this out if
you suffer from greasy lid that's really
great 77 is the black one my next thing
what item is the dura line dura lean
dura line oh my gosh when did this come
out and why didn't I don't have it this
is basically like a liquid mixing medium
that revamps any cream item into making
it more liquidy what I do what I use
this with I'll take a dot of it on the
back of my cap but underlying on here
add a little amount of the gel liner put
it in there mix it and it becomes a
liquid liner
honestly this has like saved like my
eyeliner game so much if you struggle
with using gels and you like to use
liquids more with eyeliner but you want
that gel lasting power
try the dura lean because you can mix
this with anything you can mix it with
pigment you can mix it with liner you
can mix it with anything and it's gonna
make it durable you know it's duraline
it's durable it's meant to stay on your
lids honestly it's truly one of the best
like inventions ever at mixing medium of
like yoga guys I'm sure like makeup
artists use this like crazy to my me it
was only in two items I probably lose me
I felt it my other videos were so long
next is the Laura Geller highlighter and
gilded honey oh my it's the hello
everyone right now
it's one of the prettiest highlighters
I've ever worn it reminds me of the Mac
extra dimension that like that one
that's really popular what's it called
whisper of guilt it reminds me of that
Mac whisper of guilt it has that like
really cool golden dimension to it like
it looks gold then you swatch it it has
that like really intense champagne white
and gold appearance to it it's a very
multi-dimensional highly and that's why
I like it so much I think it's
absolutely beautiful I don't see the
packaging not my favorite I think it's
kind of cheap Ede packaging it's not my
favorite kind of packaging ever but the
quality of the product inside it is
what's really truly what matters don't
judge a book by its own cover because
honestly the gilded honey by Laura
Geller is one of the nicest highlighters
I've ever tried it is so good I know
this is another thing that a lot of
people were talking about a lot of
people were like oh my god like I'm
obsessed with this highlighter right now
I think you guys need to try it out I've
done that and I didn't jump on the
bandwagon until later honestly like I'm
not a bandwagon jumper until later so
weird
hmm Sam I started using products like
after the craze kind of dies down
because it's like I feel like people are
only using it because of the crazy I
want to be able to use it because like I
want to try it out for myself not
because it's so popular you know gilded
honey is crazy good and totally worth
the hype that it's given it's great it's
so great great on every skin tone too
even if you're lighting complexion
darker and complexion medium complexion
because it has that golden sheen to it
it's gonna look pretty on literally
every single skin to last item my last
item for my favorites is the Revlon
precision lash adhesive it's this one is
like the black cap and the white body
this lash glue Patrick told me about it
he said that he usually use this all the
time like this is like his favorite lash
whoever that this is I do for house of
lashes glue and I'm like no not Rosen is
like there's no way so I would have a
body and it truly is I was shocked it's
seriously one of the best lash girls
I've ever tried I don't use duo anymore
I don't use any of the other laughs
screws I ever use I only use the Revlon
precision that same type of body has
like that has a little a little paint
painter stick you wait 10 to 15 seconds
for it to get tacky half the time of do
oh this thing is like shellac and it
keeps your lashes on all day like and
you don't need a lot of it it's so good
like I was shocked it's all in like four
or five bucks if you guys are looking
for a drugstore like lash glue that's so
good like shockingly good like wow good
try the read long one has to be the one
with the black top
and the white body though there's a
couple kind of like different ones with
red one this is the one that I like it's
so Gucci and yeah that was it for my
entire July favorite I hope you enjoyed
