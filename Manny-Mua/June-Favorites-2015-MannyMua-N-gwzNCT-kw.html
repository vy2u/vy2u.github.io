June mother Saint agree so first
things first we're gonna start with some
skincare stuff first I have been into
skincare so much like this past month
like I have so many skincare items like
there's no fairs okay so this one
actually is more special to me this is
from lush it is the gay is OK bar so
lush actually reached out to me and was
like hey mani so we're doing this really
awesome campaign for basically just like
gay rights in other countries it's like
through grassroots every penny of this
bar soap
sold is going to be going to grassroots
to help LGBT communities in other
nations are gonna see like to be part
that's a cool campaign like this
especially the one that hits home for me
obviously like okay I know if I know
it's weird I know I don't see me
but I'm gay it smells absolutely amazing
it's so like fresh oh it smells like
fresh and lemony I don't even know how
to explain it but it's honestly amazing
it's one of like five bucks and every
single cent goes to help LGBT
organizations so I'm really really
really really happy to be part of this
and thank you so much to lush for
actually sending this to me
allowing me to be part of this is
something I always tell you guys that
it's awesome to be on social media it's
all something talking about brushes and
shadows and things like that but when
you can be part of something like this
where it's helping other people it's the
most amazing feeling in the whole entire
world to be able to use my voice in this
kind of way so thank you so much to
Lester reaching out to me and letting me
be part of this gay is ok campaign
actually it's hashtag gays okay campaign
how cute is that so thank you I'm not
gonna use this cuz I love it too much to
use it like it's special to me so I'm
nothing I like wrap it up and like hang
it up or something I don't know I'm
gonna do this bad boy yet but this will
not be used because I love it too much
so thank you so much to lash I really
appreciate that next one's some more
lush items okay so basically I just
discovered lush basically I mean I have
known about lush for so long I've had
their bath balls before but I've never
tried products for them I never tried
like face products I've never tried
cleansers or toners or anything like
that
the two I've been using this past month
that I've been like life-changing for my
skin I've actually noticed a true
difference in my skin has been angels on
bare skin face and body cleanser and the
you roma water toner water so it's not
about the angels on bare skin terms so
this one is a cleanser it looks like
this it's the weirdest play-doh II type
of consistency with like big-ass seeds
in it and it's kind of a bitch to use to
be honest I just that's my opinion I
don't like having to like put it on my
hand get water make it into like a
little paste in and put it over my face
and like wash my face with that because
it kind of just feels like play-doh and
like little balls on my face I don't
like the feeling of it I just like akha
texture
I'm afraid freaks me out but it makes a
difference in my skin my pores have
gotten smaller I've had less acne and it
truly is amazing because it's good for
every single skin type it doesn't strip
the skin whatsoever and if you guys have
a chance try the angels on bare skin how
use leverage twice a day and my skin has
never looked better I haven't
ever you don't even look human up so
that one is the you Romo water toner dye
gentle rose and lavender tonic for
everyday used to help hydrate the skin
this is made for people that are more
sensitive and more mature and more dry I
do have more on the oily skin side but I
still notice that this will really help
hydrate my skin I have less dry patches
when I use this and I don't feel like I
get excessively oily whatsoever like I
really do feel like this has been
helping me so much a specific size like
lavender and rose and it's so soothing
on the skin I also noticed a huge
difference using this with the angels on
bare skin my skin has never felt and
looked better I have less dry patches
can if you guys have a lush bayou
ghetto brothers cool go look at him go
check him out they're really not see
they're really great I love the products
they smell both really great try now one
more skincare item I'm sorry go more so
obviously like I'm a skincare freak I
love skincare so much I've been loving
the natural dermis exfoliate natural
dermis is actually in Vegas today's
brands so if you guys follow me his name
on it sir I mean if you guys are into
beauty you guys probably follow Vegas
name but she is a huge huge Instagrammer
she's like 5 million or something crazy
like that 5 or 6 million and she created
a brand called natural dermis trans like
for products in number in the line and
the PR sent me some of their products
the other three are great they're good
products but that's fully is what really
like really really caught my attention
one of the nicest most gentle exfoliator
's I've ever felt in my entire life and
it's so amazing I'm not even kidding
like this is so good it's a mint it's
well eating facial facial polish let me
treat the back of it because it's way
better it gentle face polish with
ingredients drive from sugar for a mild
but deep cleanse and apricot oils smooth
and clean the skin without drying that
is so true this is an exfoliator that's
great for people who are dry if you're
dry and you want to exfoliate but you've
noticed that exfoliate your strip your
skin because you're already dry and
you're like no bitch I can't like strip
the bitch even more try the natural
dermis exfoliate it is the nicest
exfoliator one of the nicest of
Claudia's I've ever tried in my whole
life and I've tried a lot of exfoliator
it's kind of expensive like and my kind
of I mean this bitch is expensive but
it's good it's really good okay so I'm
just talk about two brushes really
quickly I don't know if I talked about
them before in the past both of them are
from more feet the morphe g0o baby bad
baby the morphe g zero has revamp to my
powder game on fleek the g zero is the
biggest powder brush I've ever used in
my entire life it's extremely soft
synthetic so doesn't harbor bacteria
it's just the most amazing powder brush
I've ever tried it's huge
green I getting my neck I always powder
my neck I don't really like to put
liquids on my neck liquid foundation so
I use a lot of powders on my neck so
this is so great I getting a large
amount of powder on the skin above
really blending it out because it is
dense but it's so fluffy that it really
helps spread the powder rather than
putting too much on and you're like
that's so much powder this really
honestly just like diffuses powder out
so nicely oh my god and I use it on my
face as well but it is so absolutely
using I'm not kidding if you guys can't
I don't know if it's sold out I have no
idea I didn't check before I recorded
this but if you guys can grab the g0
before it's got me it's a permanent it's
a permanent brush if you guys want to
start using this you will not go back
you will not use another powder brush it
is so nice
the next brush I talked about it before
actually but I just need to talk about
it again it is the e36 which is one of
the new elite collection brushes this is
the best pencil brush I've ever used in
my entire life it is so soft synthetic
picks up product really nice deposits
really nice and it blends like a little
dream I have four of these now I can't
stop yeah and you don't if you guys were
to get it you would understand what I'm
talking about I can't I don't know how
to Elsa explain like how good a pencil
brush is usually pencil brushes are
super super dense and they're rough on
the eye and I get super frustrated cuz
I'm like dude I need this being bitch to
be soft because like it's a little
sensitive hearing oh right there you
know very soft but still picks up the
product really nicely and blends it
really nicely so that you 36 if you can
I don't know if it sold out either I'm
sorry if it is but it is so good you
guys need to get that you 36 I'm Keaney
obviously with morphine I do have a
morphe coat I am an affiliate with
morphe brushes um I like to let you guys
know that I do make a small Commission
off of when you guys buy with my coat
wanna let you guys know I like to leave
you guys know about my affiliates and
stuff like that beforehand because I
feel it's just more honest if you use
the code man um you weigh in all caps
you guys do save 10% off a lot of you
guys already know that you guys will
tweet me pictures of morphe brushes that
you guys have button but just one let
you guys know those are you are new if
you like if you're new subby you don't
know let me tell you okay okay next is
the my foundation of life for this past
couple months
live honey it is the dior air flash
foundation i don't know if i i've
already calmed down so much channel
several times but it's just so good it
is so good i just feel like it like the
 like the hobbit like this is my
ring and i'm like the and it's like my
precious i'm like it's seriously the
alexis foundation i've ever worn in my
life it is the most beautiful finish
beautiful coverage looks full wallace on
the skin without looking heavy it gives
you a natural like face gene I don't
know how to explain honestly I don't
even know great for all skin types
honestly I would if I was oily which I
have if you're oily you definitely want
to use a mattifying primer underneath it
because they will accentuate your oils
if you don't because it is going to give
you a natural Sheen to the skin because
not a mattifying foundation whatsoever
I'm gonna shade 300 and I like to spray
it on a flat top kabuki brush and Pat it
into my skin and it looks so beautiful
it is expensive this bitch is so pricey
I almost I almost had a little bit of a
moment when I had to pay this little
 but I heard such great things
about it I had to buy it and I'm so
happy I did if I run out of this which I
will I will definitely be finding more
of it even despite the price because it
is all good then talk about how tight is
let's talk about tight alike to us next
so I just want to talk about a quick
highlighter because it's the one I'm
wearing right now and I absolutely love
it it is the Becca cosmetics and
Jacqueline Hill collaboration champagne
pop one of the nicest highlighters I've
ever tried in my entire life it is so
smooth so beautiful and I'm not just
saying that because Jacqueline's my
friend I'm never gonna talk about a
product I don't love even if my friend
has created it or even if a friend of
mine that's collab with a brand
if the product isn't nice I'm not gonna
talk about it I mean no offense to my
friends if one they do create products
and things like that but I feel like
it's more honest with you guys my
subscribers and that's what I want so I
mean no offense to my friends at every
club with a brand but this is just what
this is how I feel if I ever clap with
the brand if I send it to a friend and
they don't like it I would never expect
them to talk about and I would not want
them to talk about it it's not truly how
they feel they're not how they I want it
to be genuine you know and I genuinely
genuinely love champagne pop i swatched
it on my hand we swatch it look bit more
it is the most beautiful peachy gold
highlighter I've ever seen I'm wearing
it on my cheekbones right now as soon as
I got it that guy seriously I have not
put it down I worn it almost every
single time I've worn makeup I will wear
champagne pop it's just absolutely
beautiful and I'm so so so proud of
Jacqueline for be able to do this it
just feels so amazing I'm just like so
happy for her you know socially like an
accomplishment to be able to collab with
a brand like like Becca who's in Sephora
Jacqueline won't be in Sephora is like
how crazy is that you know I'm just so
proud of her and I love her so much I
know it's gonna be such a hot item like
it will be gone so fast if you guys can
awesome if you can't I'm sorry I'm sorry
for talking about this pair of lashes
really quickly I think I've talked about
them before and in previous favorites
but and I wear all the time it's
actually the pair of wearing right now
they're called Bella Ming's abide new
bound some I think I've talked about the
minitor favorites I don't even know but
I don't even care they're that good to
me this is the pair I have another pair
this is what they look like they're the
most amazing like Zig zaggy flared out
wispy 3d minks I've ever tried if I
cannot stop right now I can
stop wearing them at every event
everything I go to I will wear this pair
and they're so good days I feel like
that makes my Hinds just look so much
more open and especially in the center
like they flare so intensely like they
can even like they'll even hit my
umbrella kinda so such a drag queen they
are definitely more of an intense pair
of lashes they're not so like for the
everyday woman you know what I mean like
they're definitely more intense they're
more event lashes like if you're going
to the club or get really smoky I think
this is a great pair of lashes to wear
because you could actually see them this
pair photographs so good you're more
into a more natural lashes try the new
bound some lashes in Australian mist
or Australian me howdy know what they
call their Australian something they're
such a beautiful natural pair up I'll
link new Bunsen down below also what I
love about a new bathroom so much I'm
gonna fill it with new bounce um and
they gave my followers a 20% off coupon
code I've never heard of a brand a lash
brand offering my followers 20% off
never never never never never never it's
just a such an awesome deal like you get
20% off but the code man um your way
like that's such an awesome freaking
deal dude go ahead and move on let's go
and move on to the next product
the next product I'm gonna gonna talk
about is the mac mineralize skinfinish
in the shade medium that's my change I
wanna talk about quickly the mac
mineralize skinfinish is because they
are absolutely beautiful i completely
forgot about the mac mineralize
skinfinish as ice or cat Mac and I used
to use them all the time and I you loved
him I loved him so much and I completely
forgot about them and don't use it
recently with the door air flash and I
cannot stop using them like I'll set my
face with a translucent powder like the
Laura Mercier I want and then I'll put
this on top and it gives me the most
beautiful skin like finish ever like
when it says mineralized skinfinish it's
true the fact that it's a mineral powder
gives you a skin finish Sheen and it's
so stunning if you're like someone that
likes to be more on the natural side of
makeup that doesn't look too too too
matte or to-to-to glowy
but still want to have a natural skin
finish to the face try the mac
mineralize skinfinish is they are so
bomb i forgot about them they're kinda
pricey they are pricey for a powder now
they're pricey for power lock they are
good but they aren't damn good another
Mac item I have to talk about me is the
boom-boom room shadow by Mac this is
part of their dazzle shadow collection
like the lid disco collection that they
had this shadow is so ridiculous as you
guys saw earlier this week
I did have a tutorial up using this this
shadow in it I'll leave a link down
below if you guys don't know what I'm
talking about I uploaded on Tuesday but
it's the most awesome
badass like multi-dimensional glitter I
ever came across it's so sickening
I love the shadows I think they're
absolutely beautiful I have no idea if
they're permanent whatsoever or if
they're gonna be coming back at all but
what I have noticed that if you want to
use this shut or any kind of the dazzle
shadows try to use a glitter glue primer
underneath your eye trust me when I say
that it will help so much because they
do have fallout they do have fall
they're a very dry texture when you feel
them they feel dry so that means it will
fall off onto the face so what I do is I
use like I like to use my finger like
glitter glue on the glint first and then
press with my finger over the glitter
glue and that and notice has no fallout
for me and it just it makes the shadow
look more intense and more like vibrant
vivacious office information I grant
that urban decay like solstice I think
is very similar to this shadow but I
mean I had the shadow when I loved it so
try it out here as Cannes you guys to
find it grab boo boo room good I just
wanna talk about a quick eye primer that
I've been loving for the past a while it
has been just one month is in a while
it's just been like two months I like to
forgotten talking about last month this
is the Smashbox 24 hour photo finish
shadow primer this primer has saved my
ass multiple times so this is the primer
I wear if I go to an event or if I go to
like something that I know my makeup
nice lasts all day without creasing
without anything I will use this primer
this is the most amazing eye primer for
those of you who have oily lids if you
have an oily lid and like suffer from
creases using other primers try the
smashbox 24-hour it is so good it's like
basically straight of silicone and it
really helps keep the oils of your lid
at bay so that it doesn't crease on your
top the day i've had this one this has
kept my shadows run for like 13 hours at
the most it goes like 13 hours and it
looked the same as when i did it 13
hours previously i don't know what it is
about this it is so good I'm not kidding
like if you guys can try it out you want
to use a very small amount of this so
you can not use a lot like I'm talking
like for the whole lid like this that is
for two eyes use a very tiny amount a
little bit goes a very long way which
was which is great because this will
last a while Dan yeah that was it for my
entire June favorites and thank you so
much for watching bye love favorites
videos are my favorite videos to watch
and to film it just feels like I'm
talking to you guys about products that
I truly love myself and it's just like I
want to let's try these out and my
favorite part is when people meet me and
they Instagram me and they're like hey

recommendation and I absolutely love it

like I just feel like I don't know it's
makes you feel like you guys like trust
me and that you guys love it is just as
much as I do and makes me feel good it

talking about
