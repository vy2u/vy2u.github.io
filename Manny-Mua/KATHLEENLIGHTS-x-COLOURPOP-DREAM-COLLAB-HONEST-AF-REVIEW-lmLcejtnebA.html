okay guys let's get into it this video
I'm talk about the pricing really
quickly because that's like the fastest
quickest part the dream street pallets
from Kathleen in the color pop retails
for sixteen dollars and you get twelve
eyeshadows which is crazy which is
fucking crazy I don't know how I mean I
dunno how color pop does it with like
lower price points because that's like a
whole nother story of how color pop user
prices really really low doesn't matter
it's fucking amazing the fact that it's
sixteen dollars and twelve shadows
that's crazy I love that and then you
get three lippies two statins and one
glass for $18 another amazing amazing
deal like it's like what is that like
six bucks a item so it's pretty freakin
good so I can want to start off this
video with the eye shadow look I am
already primed in my face is basically
done I'm actually going to an event
after this I'm going to Patrick's Mac
collaboration launch party oh my all
these collabs all these fuckin collabs
coming out which is so exciting like I
love love love love seeing and filchers
get to do collabs and just do fun things
with friends that they love so it makes
me really genuinely happy I'm gonna go
ahead and go into it so we have the
power right here this is we got we got
James Street the same exact packaging as
this I mean it's not exactly exactly the
same obviously you can see it's all
exactly the same but it's pretty fucking
similar it's pretty similar we have this
we have the shades on the back which I
love that includes the shades these are
the pressed shadow palette this is what
it looks like right here this is what
the palette looks like sorry guys I want
to make it so it's not too bright right
there this is the palette right there
it's stunning stunning
it's fucking stunning let's go and get
this bad bitch like I just want to jump
on in like like a big bump right here
yeah literally jumped up at my face and
clocked me on the nose if it looks a
little broken right now I apologize and
we're gonna dip into this palette right
here we're gonna go into the shade right
here which is called so I believe that
this shade is twinkle and Stardust or is
it magical instituting star or no it's
opposite shooting star magical and
taking the goddamn fucking orange Etan
one okay I'm taking this I'm topping
into the palette right here and you can
see there is actually some fallout that
comes out right here but I don't mind a
lot of fallout like I've already told
you guys before as long as it like the
blend is there
I don't mind fallout really yeah like I
just think it's part of beauty it's a
fucking powder so I'm gonna take that on
a more feet r37 I'm gonna put that into
the crease
this is like a very like mustardy warm
transition shade shades are blending
literally so fucking well like they're
amazing
I mean colour-pop has their own single
shadows of course and they are such high
quality I love the single shadows as
well like they really just kill it so
far so good I think it looks beautiful
it cannot wait to continue want to news
have you guys seen the sinner
I took a show on USA and it's with
Jessica Biel you guys that show put me
through it like truly I went through it
with that show and I finished like all
the episodes super fast zone like eight
episodes I think and literally it's so
fucking good I mean honestly you guys
should watch it I'm just saying this is
like a random side note like while I'm
getting ready cuz getting ready like by
yourself when you have no music playing
is kind of boring so I'm just gonna
chitchat with you guys so should I do
mermaid boy on the lid this is this is
the mermaid boys when I've been like
looking at and I'm like mmm but I feel
like I've been doing like a lot of that
recently like that kind of shade on the
lid I mean look at my Instagram and see
what the fuck I've been doing let me go
look because if I haven't that I'm gonna
do it
Oh see I just did something like that
with the morphe palette on the 7th of
November look at that see that shit hey
Justin down on this 7 she's annoying I
was gonna blow it out underneath my lash
line but I just did something like that
recently too but what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna make it really really warm so
I'm gonna take this really pretty Coco a
shade which is I think called potion
such a pretty really really really warm
orange II read into Brown oh my gosh
it's so pretty I'm taking this on a more
if you are 39 brush by the way and we
are gonna take this up into the crease
I'm gonna take it all the way in because
I'm gonna kind of make this little
smokier pull this bitch out
give me some fucking length oh this
shade is much more powdery than the
other shade was just send you guys know
be careful because there is more
kickback on this one as long as you guys
are aware and you guys know what's gonna
go on it sound good don't forget to like
like this the blend is amazing they work
so pretty on the eyes I'm so happy with
this so far like truly I really really
really am woah look at that crease the
fuck so we have so far on the eyes
really pretty crease shade down super
warm super cont
you guys I don't know what lynching to
use is really in front of me
this one do these four were here it
looks stunning they feel stunning
everything about it's stunning is it
worth that right here hmm
or watch I say fucking just going with
murmuring point so beautiful I'm gonna
have to I'm gonna fucking have to first
off I love color
second of all it's stunning on the
finger I just like these kind of shades
with you it's so beautiful like actually
stunning there's so many IV lenses going
on right now because there's so many
fires happening it's so it's so
devastating it's terrifying actually
there's a little bit of fog so make sure
you're using a packing brush for this
bad boy or your finger like I said
earlier looks good huh damn she looked
good now I'm actually gonna take this
really really chocolaty warm brown right
here I'm gonna put that on to the outer
corner just a deep and everything on to
help connect duochrome shade with the
transitions just it just helps like when
you're adding a darker shade right here
to merge the transition and that intense
foiled shade it's hard to get that blend
easy and seamless but I like to do is I
added a really darker color between them
so as you can see like the blend just
gets a little easier okay so we got this
down so far he goes do the bottom lash
line really quickly I won't be good
don't want to put blue underneath the
lower lash line that cuz there's like
that really beautiful like this guy
right there under the lash line and just
smoke that out I think I tau taking mix
ardency in brown eyeliner really
saturate that bitch go ahead and blend
out that so that it doesn't set too
quickly because we wanted to be a
seamless blend so we're blending out
that Brown and now it's going to take
some of that blue really pretty like
blueish sure looks like a peacock
whoa is so much more pigmented I thought
was gonna be holy shit we're gonna go
ahead and set the brown with that blue
be careful with this a crisis because it
is so pigmented it gets like it gets
like really that can get dirty real
quick so just be careful damn and this
is our eye so far you guys I'm gonna go
in apply some eyeliner and finish off of
this eye off of care
I'll be right back okay guys so here we
have the I we are completely done I just
added some lashes and some eyeliner I'm
wearing Lily lashes at Miami I applied a
little bit of highlight right here in
the inner corner and on my brow bone and
that's all I've done off of camera so
now let's go ahead and get into the why
even do lips actually I'm gonna go ahead
and swatch the shades that I did not use
on my eyes today I should I can show you
guys so we have this really pretty cool
toned Brown over here is what she looks
like right here I'm gonna go and swatch
it on my arm so you guys can see and I'm
just gonna literally do a full like arm
swatch I didn't use this bronzy copper
this guy didn't use and here you have
the other shades that I did not use in
the palette you guys right here I did
not use one two three four five six
seven shades from the palette these are
them right here this one's like a really
like like a soft satiny shimmer it's
hard to see on camera this one was
actually I think mine's like fucked up
because it wasn't picking up like the
other ones were it's the only shadow in
the entire palette I wasn't picking up
everything else picked up amazingly
swatched amazing okay so now we're gonna
move on to the lips $18 for the three
we're gonna pull this guy open this is
the classic color puppet packaging this
is like what they normally package
themselves in we have the glossy and the
two statins Hey we have moonchild glass
which I love the name of that dreamy and
re there right there so we have our here
we have the lip trio stunning stunning
stunning stunning I'm gonna go in swatch
the glass first this is in the shade of
course it moving child this glass is
everything so comfortable so smooth
feels amazing on the lips when I fucking
love it like this is it's a bad
application bad application let's ignore
that but it's an amazing amazing color
okay so now we're gonna go in with the
ultra satin lip in the shade dreamy
I love the ultra satin lip so I'm so
happy she did not do an ultra matte lips
I don't like those as much the Sam lips
and the glosses are my favorite like I
don't like the matte lips that much from
them mmm so this color in the orange one
might not really go with my eye I just
want you guys to see what they look like
on the lips we have a dreamy right here
the shade reminds me a lot of have on
deal Alita - it's like that beautiful
terracotta
warm pink but it has like a lot of like
earthy undertones in it these are so
easy to take off like that makes me
genuinely happy and last but not least
we have Revere it's art key with an
apostrophe or like a little asterisk we
are I think it's Revere Revere there's
like a
hot orange hot orange hot hahaha neon
hot orange I think better say fuck I
love this shade fuck I love it like I
actually love it if I wasn't wearing
this I bitch this shit will look so
snatched on me like I don't know what it
is

sometimes I don't but this one oh my god
so I'm looking in the viewfinder right
now to see if I'm standing in focus by
the way I love Revere like I fucking
love it I don't want to take it off
because I like it so much so I just
quickly want to swatch the lips on the
arm as well just you can see how they
look like on them there's skin so we
have of course the first class we have
moon child right here moon child
