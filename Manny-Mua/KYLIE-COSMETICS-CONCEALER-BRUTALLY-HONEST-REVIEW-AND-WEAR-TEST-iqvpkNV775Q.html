so today's video is going to be a review
and a demo using the entire brand new
Qaeda Cosmetics concealers you have the
entire purified look this look at
this
Oh My heck recently she launched the
concealers brush set and lipsticks like
an actual lipstick tube thought you know
what I wanted to try the concealers I
never turned it out when I did a review
on the brush set does the first time I'm
trying is I'm like gonna test it out for
the first time so that's we're gonna be
doing so you guys I'm gonna do a demo
and a wear test I will be back a couple
hours later having a dinner of anything
to go to tonight so I thought it'd be
kind of good to vlog as I'm out or I'm
gonna try to vlog over I remember and
come back and go check in at the end of
the night because it's been like a
certain amount of time how I've had my
makeup on hope you guys enjoy as always
you guys don't like this if you guys do
not like me please don't watch
it you know the drill with that but you
guys do like this video please go and
subscribe to my channel if you're not
already also do not forget I am doing a
giveaway month here in December this is
the giveaway that I'm doing in this
video
boom this is the giveaway going on all I
need to do is subscribe to my channel
and comment down below where you're from
and how I can get a hold of you whether
it's your email your Instagram whatever
it might be so I can actually reach out
to you and that's it that's the only
thing you need to do I'm just doing an
entire month of giveaways in December
because I don't know I just feel like
December so I'm not giving back so if I
can get back to you guys I would love to
do that and that's oh I'm trying to do
as much as I can anyway let's go ahead
and stop rambling and get into this
video using Kylie Jenner's concealers
you guys might have my beefs done we
have just foundation we set foundation
on this hair drives me wild you guys
understand like this one here that likes
to sit is it longer than the rest like
before it goes down look how far it goes
down anyway so I'm gonna talk about the
concealer really quickly I just looked
up the retail value of the concealer and
it's only dusting only but it's 20 bucks
I'm really happy about that price but I
think 20 bucks is really fair I feel
like there's a lot of concealers that
are priced at like 25 to 30 so I feel
like a twenty dollar concealer is it
super fair this is what they look like
right here they are in this kind of
small shorter components very it's the
same component as Jeffrey stars lega
lipsticks as wet wilds liquid lipsticks
as sugar pills liquid lipsticks I'm sure
you guys recognize this little bottle
right here I'm gonna take this shade of
Gib summer ivory I don't know this is
ivory ivory let's just see what we think
so
it comes with point 22 ounces at six
point three grams of product that goes
in here they have a flat paddle
situation let's go ahead and try it oh
my god her just going right in I guess I
ever he's actually like really close to
my own personal shade I think I'm gonna
go I'm gonna mix a little bit of that
give some shade with it just a little
bit lighter okay guys the moment of
truth we have to concede on it actually
feels really nice on my skin I'm not
gonna lie feels pretty good like
I'm very happy with all this feels
muscle got it up close
wanna take our little Real Techniques
sponge blend this concealer as I'm
blending right now as I'm going in and
blending this away it blends very very
nicely honestly pretty
effortlessly if I say so myself actually
blends really nicely it has almost like
a satin finish it's not it's like almost
glow as you can see like right - that's
when I can see the right can you guys
see how this area right there is almost
more glowy than the rest of my faces
it's a concealer it has a very wet
looking appearance the coverage looks
almost full like I put a lot of it on so
I think that you can definitely get to a
full coverage I think I'm at a full
coverage right now I don't see any of my
like darkness peaking through I've never
had a concealer that looked so do you
want my skin before I've never had to do
he concealer like this I'm kind of like
whoa we have some are going set this guy
and see what we think I'm gonna take my
Charlotte Tilbury powder in the shade at
number one this seems like a concealer
you definitely would want to set because
it is more of a dewy glowy finish this
does have a bitch I feel like wouldn't
move around on you you know I mean
because it is not so mattifying so go
ahead put that on we're gonna set that
into this
skin but honestly like this looks really
pretty like I'm actually living so it
makes me very happy taking the other
side with a sponge setting the other
side what do we think guys I think it
looks bomb oh my gosh I'm like
really really pleasantly pleased I think
it looks really really really pretty
okay guys so first impressions right
away I think that the coverage was a
nice medium to full coverage it's very
buildable the finish of it is a dewy
finish I'm actually really shocked about
it it wasn't increasing to faster than
my eyes either which I really really
liked and now I have it set with powder
I don't see any creasing going on it's
like any my other favorite concealers
there's no bad creasing nothing bad
going on here so I'm really really happy
about this I'm gonna go ahead and finish
my makeup off of camera really quickly
I'm gonna do my thing and I will come
back when I'm about to leave and do a
little final sign-off and we will see
what our verdict of the concealer is and
how it wears throughout the day but so
far first impressions I think it's
really really pretty ok guys so this is
the final look I just want to do a quick
black smokey eye
I love that's very very sexy it's really
fun and so sultry and I'm going out to a
dinner tonight with some YouTube people
and so I figure you know let me just go
and go to kill let's go to slay
one more thing you want a shitty thing
about doing a black smokey eye on camera
I never really looks at that blended in
that like nice and I'm always kind of
like but in person like this bitches
blend into filth you know I'm saying
like it just look it looks good I swear
anyway guys the concealers still looks
really nice there's no creasing on my
face whatsoever everything is looking
really pretty nose is snatched I'm gonna
leave it now actually or leave in like
an hour I guess and I'll be checking in
along the way like in a vlogging style
hopefully yeah we'll remember when I'm
at this dinner to check in and show you
guys what my consider my undereye in my
whole center of my face is doing but
other than that you guys I'm good I'm
gonna go check out I'll see you guys
very very soon and we will have a final
verdict on what I think of this
concealer after a wear test ok guys so I
ended up making it over to Laura's house
so I am testing the concealer from Kylie
what do we think I think it looks so
good does it but I tried it today and it
reminds me so much at heart shape tape
honestly your eyes heart shape sharp
shape to see everybody's chart t-shaped
ooh
no but honesty really did I put a lot on
it so it did give me a nice full
coverage and it looked it still looks
really pretty anyways guys I'm gonna try
check-in it I don't know if I can make
it I really don't cuz I really want to
get his makeup so yes so do a check-in
at the end I know I know now you
understand why I'm wearing it so so it's
been about seven hours since I have had
the concealer on and so what do we think
also before I even finish off my black
shadow that crease is going on it's
actually really funny cuz any blue or
black eyeshadow that I wear this happens
to me every single time I do it so what
happens is like I have my eyes open and
I'm talking abut I'm doing this the
black from my lid transfers on to my
hooded lid deciding you know so that's
why it kind of looks like that it's
literally so annoying but I there's
nothing I can do about it happens to me
every single time if I'm wearing makeup
like a black eye shadow look or dark
blue eye shadow or dark purple this
opportunity every single time it's
unavoidable for me and it pisses
me off because of this hooded lead final
thoughts on the concealer I'm gonna go
to bed some tired so what do I
think about the Kylie cosmetics
concealers honest to god I really like
them I'm very very very happy about them
i 100% will say that this is a hit I
would purchase them myself and honestly
I'm gonna continue to use it so I feel
like that's when I know product I really
do enjoy because I'm like I want to
continue I want to use it see what I
think about it more today of course was
more of a first impressions but I'm
looking in the mirror right now like
there's no creases everything looks so
pretty still of course I am a greasy
greasy greasy nasty mess because of me
not blotting my face one time in seven
hours but honestly the concealer the
amount I put on gave me full coverage it
felt really nice and creamy and
luxurious something without feeling too
cakey without being too heavy it blended
out very easily I have no qualms with it
I'm so happy that I like turned out to
be amazing and I'm so happy with how
they turned out how easy to supply like
that it has like that Urban Decay Naked
weightless like like flat paddle
application I really like that I like
that for concealers the most I feel like
you get the most application for your
buck or for an application in general so
all in all Kylie cosmetics you all
killed it with the concealers I'm so
happy and honestly I think the price
point is also very very fair I think 20
bucks for a concealer is really really
great like I think that's a really
really fair price point specially for a
concealer works very nicely it's
beautiful I'm gonna continue to wear it
after the brush debacle with
price point I'm really happy to see that
kite house makes these can see there's
20 bucks yeah you guys already know I'm
gonna always keep it real whether I like
something right don't it is what it is
I'm gonna say whether I like it or
whether I don't and does I matter the
brand does not matter the celebrity
behind the brand doesn't matter at all
at the end of the day I have the
consumers back and that's what matters
to me I don't give a if I make the
brand angry at me or if they want to
stop sending me PR and this is going to
any brand not kinda Cosmetics
specifically or anything like that but I
just want to say that because this is a
review video just because I get
something sent to me for free does not
mean that I'm gonna act nice about it
you know what I mean it doesn't mean
anything to me it just means that hey I
got it early I was like I do this for a
full-time living but that also does not
mean I'm gonna be fake as and like
say something is amazing when it's not
I've never been like that I'm never
gonna be like that it doesn't matter if
the brand doesn't matter the
patron doesn't matter what kind of coin
they're offering me that is what it is
because honestly my word is more
important and I feel like I've built my
manniac community and my YouTube off of
my word I would never want to betray
that never never never
at first I was kind of shocked cuz it
went on almost like a Dewey fit like a
dewy glowy finish but after you said it
it just looks really beautiful
and it's stayed looking beautiful for
the last 7 hours like I'm like really
happy and stop creasing doesn't look
ugly like it looks really pretty yeah
guys that's it for today's video do not
forget to enter my giveaway I will leave
the rules at down below but yeah how
great for the night or day wherever you
