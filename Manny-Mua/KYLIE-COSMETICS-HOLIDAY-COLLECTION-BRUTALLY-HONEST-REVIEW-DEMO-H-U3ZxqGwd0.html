Holiday Collection I thought it looked
really really cute there was actually
one thing actually two things from me
that I really wanted which was the wet
set and the nice palette the nice
palettes like there's no naughty the
nice palette I really really wanted to
be nice one so I'm like and I want to
review the entire collection to see the
collection was worth they actually don't
really know exactly the retail value of
it yet I'll be going into it more when I
search up the products on my phone on
Instagram and Hearst website and things
like that so we will get more into that
a little bit later it's Thanksgiving
week right now and today is Tuesday
tomorrow's my dad's birthday and
Thanksgiving is the next day so I'm
gonna be going down to San Diego to hang
out with my family and then I'm sure
this is gonna be going up when I'm still
in San Diego I'm so excited like this is
like such a fun time I love the holidays
so fucking much and I'm actually gonna
be doing a really big giveaway in
December which I'm so excited about I'm
also going to be doing a toy drive in
December with morphe so I'm so excited
about that as well I love trying to get
back as much as I can during the holiday
season getting to see people being happy
during the holidays is like such a
rewarding thing and I absolutely love it
so much so let's go and get in today's
video as always if you guys do not like
this video if you guys do not like me
please don't fucking watch it you know
I'm cool with that
Shane every goddamn video but if you
guys do like this video please go ahead
and subscribe to my channel if you're
not already and if renew what's up I'm
an emu a and welcome to my channel thank
you so much for being here yeah let's go
ahead and get into this Cuddy cosmetics
Holiday Collection
so I have nothing on my eyes right now
because I wanted to do a look using the
palette I wanted to use I have no
highlighter on so I wanted to try the
wet set and I have no lipstick on
because I want to swatch a couple de
lipsticks course I'm gonna do with the
majority on my arm I'm trying to swatch
no fucking 11 lifting okay so this is
the set holy jesus do we see these so
what do we start with first I think I'm
going with a wet set first I'm so
excited this is the wet set this is the
holiday wet set it looks like this
actually is a really really cool
glittery ombre effect that goes down I
don't you guys see it I'm gonna try to
catch it
ah right there you see this all this
like glitter falling so we have the
Kylie cosmetics pressed powder palette
each of these powders comes with 11
grams of product which is a really
really nice amount we have sugar coated
frostbite sweet dream and ginger breaded
those are the shade names this guy is
made in the USA and it retails for I
don't know let's look it up and see if
they actually have it even um on the
sides I believe that the Kylie stuff it
releases tomorrow okay guys so I can
actually find anywhere where the retail
price of the wet said it's gonna be the
last one I believe was like 60 something
dollars some assuming this is gonna be
similar to that pricey so let's go ahead
open it I was really excited think the
only one that they have shown so far is
that is the pallets and the pallets are
gonna retail for $44 so this is what the
packaging looks like guys it's like a
really really intense glittery silver
glitter intensity craziness it's a
beautiful yes it's cool looks really
cool but this is the time factor that
has a glitter that comes off on you and
I fucking hated that I absolutely hate
this is a personal thing if you guys
don't mind that great that's all good
but I proceeded to not like that I
really get some my nerves okay when hand
I turn down the brightness a little bit
so maybe that would help to you guys and
see what it will look like so this is
the palette right here let's go and
describe these shades here right we have
sugar coated frostbite sweet dream
gingerbread we have sugar coated is a
purple pink reflect we have frostbite
which is a it's a white bass tons of
shimmery flakes in it and it almost has
like glittery chunks in it that's what
it looks like so we have sweet dream and
this is more of a peach with a golden
reflect and we have gingerbread which
like a bronzy shimmer that's we got here
so it's going to swatch the four of them
sugar coat in well they feel just as
good as the last one did frostbite
this bitch is so we got them right here
guys we have the four right there I'm on
my hand
right here guys we got the four right
there boom that is so nice okay guys I
think I want to use sweet use my finger
a little bit and I'm gonna also try to
use B do blending to see what works best
do I go wet highlighter here as you guys
know it doesn't really go on well with a
like highlighting brush I got more for
you brush I usually go in with it's a
fluffy brush like that doesn't really
work with this as much so we have right
here boom which is beautiful it
absolutely is stunning I'm very happy
with this oh that's so this is my
favorite color of the group it's a
peachy home oh my gosh you guys it looks
so nice with the finger I'm gonna put a
little bit of sugar-coated at the top
corner just to give it a little bit more
of a pop like right there oh my god I
live a thousand lives right now for this
one I loved the last wet set I thought
was so so so good it was so pretty the
close of this one I don't like as much
as the last wet set but it is a holiday
wet so so if you guys do enjoy them and
you guys want some it's limited edition
I would definitely suggest getting this
wet set because it is beautiful it looks
beautiful on the skin it blends in so
nicely
you see itch guys I'm like a really big
fan of the kpop group BTS right now like
I'm not folding for them I've been
listening to the music so now let's go
into the pouch because I want to get my
eye makeup done right now so we have a
two pallets here guys we have the
naughty and we have the nice palette
which i think is such a cute idea this
is like something I'm really really
excited about I love the concept of
using like a naughty and nice or like a
contrasting thing actually have an idea
for my own brand I've had this idea for
a while to do like a double palette kind
of situation with a idea and it's
definitely it's gonna happen like it's
already like it's gonna happen like this
is something that I've like been wanting
to do not naughty and nice of course but
like my own spin on a dual palette so I
really like that she did this because
it's it's so fun to me like I love this
contrasting idea we have the naughty
powder here which is this like felt like
Nadia's filled in with this felt thing
going on we have the nice palette which
is nice with like the cute little
bubbles with the felt as well first
things first we have the nice palette
which is at this guy right here this
guy's is the palette that I'm gasping
for I think it's so fucking beautiful
and it's 44 bucks that's a fair price
point for 14 shades to me like that is
really really
really fair and Kylie has some really
really nice shadows so I'm like bitch
yes go on this is a nice palette oh this
is nice
I love I live I live I live and we also
have the naughty palette right here
which retails for 44 and is also 14
shades deep here which I also think is a
beautiful palette this is not like my
favorite of the two but it is very very
nice I don't I think it's just because
it's not the most cohesive palette ever
I'm kind of looking at it and I'm like
the fuck am I gonna do I don't know so
this is like not my cup of tea as much
but we're gonna swatch some of the
sheets you guys can see what they look
like we'll do a couple of them we have
snow ball which is a white we're gonna
swatch them on my arm jingle which is
like some weird like glittery shading
that doesn't swatch is nice jingle is
not that great you have unwrap me which
is like a moon oh go ahead and do
emerald bitch oh and it feels so good
holy shit that goes nice oh ho ho cuz
you know I love a good ho and let's do
snowflake that's like a really pretty
intense silver so these are a couple of
the shades i swatched on my arm right
here this is just finger swatch the
maroon one right there swatches a little
patchy and weird but I know I'm sure
it'll blend nicely on that I and they
swatch nicely though like they're not
bad at all so I'm impressed
I like I like for me of the two I like
the nice palette more so now we have the
nice palette which bitch this is
speaking to me I'm sorry this is so
fucking pretty honestly am I kind of
screaming inside I just think it's so
nice I don't even know what color I want
to go in with it because it's all so
pretty if I can look at a palette and
I'm like oh my god I want to use it all
that's where I know I want a palette I'm
going with a shade miracle miracles from
into the crease I'm taking this on a
Murphy and 511 it's a big fluffy brush
like to go in with transition shades
with the brush like this just to kind of
get it everywhere and I go in with
macaroon and Santa Baby and they're
picking up nicely on the brush they're
really nice
I like Kylie cosmetics has really picked
it up in the shadow realm I think that
they're really really really pretty
formulas that they have been coming out
with with the palettes recently have
been really really nice I've been really
enjoying the fucking palettes dude like
they've been stepping they're fucking
shit up I want to do like a pinky intent
like a pinky crease I want to take
blizzard on the lid because I haven't
used a shade like that in a minute and
it is a speaking to me or just building
up you guys it blends beautifully on the
eyes like it looks absolutely beautiful
I'm very very very happy with how it's
looking so now I'm going with the shade
wonderful and
like a really deep dark chocolate brown
nothing to go on the outer corner just a
deep in bed just a little bit more
beautiful it's beautiful except nicely
pray that it blends nice thing as well
so let's go ahead and deposit it with
the brush now I'm taking that on a
morphe m4 three three great just like
fluffy packing brush but that into the
crease fuck that shit's real pigmented a
little goes a long way I'm gonna take it
all the way in to the inner portion of
the eye as well right up into the inner
crease keeping it of course darkest on
the outer corner but I'm gonna take it
all the way in so we got so far you guys
we just have a nice really pretty pinky
purple I look fucking great okay guys so
now I go with the shade blizzard which
I'm so excited to go in with so I'm
taking this shade a blizzard on a morphe
m16 seven which is a really packing
brush you can see I've packed it on
there I'm not gonna apply that with a
wet brush oh my god that's so beautiful
oh my word oh my fucking neck me encanta
fucking use my finger this is like a
dual chrome blue purple it's like a
balloon maroon dual chrome and it's
really pretty bits actually a lot less
pigmented than I thought it was going to
be like as if I should have probably had
a base color underneath this cuz I feel
like a little bit of my skin is peeking
through it's still stunning don't get me
wrong but I am just noticing that right
now as I'm applying you I'm like I feel
like I can see some of my skin peeking
through
doesn't matter doesn't matter so just be
careful with the fall of the shade guys
because there is some fallout that
happens because it is more of a flakey
duochrome e-type shade but it looks
fucking beautiful and I really really
like it woah I'm gonna finish the top of
the eye on the other side and I'll be
right back okay guys so here we have it
the top of the eyes are done with
blizzard if you guys do get this palette
just be aware that is a flakier shade
there's gonna be a lot of fallout that's
going on and you definitely want to use
the shadow wet or use a glitter glue I
think that would be the easiest bet it's
a little difficult to use but it the
effect is there and it looks so great
now I'm gonna take a little bit of a
same shade macaron the miracle mix them
I'm gonna do the lower lash line now and
it'll really tie up the whole the whole
look you know I'm playing the whole
taking that on a more feet e17 it's a
great little lower lash line blender
just cuz it's like compact now we're
gonna take a little bit of Wonderland
and hot cider and a little more for a 36
and run put that closest to the lash
line to give us some definition and
depth because
all look like we have some pink guy you
know I'm saying mmm-hmm and it's fine so
I'll blend it out right now that's
totally coolers no put the color down
we're gonna blend when we're dead Beach
up with that and I'll blend that out
with that same little b-17 I'm gonna do
a warm-up brown eyeliner in the
waterline which is I'm taking Marc
Jacobs real cuckoo which I absolutely
loves like my favorite ever this shit
makes my green eyes it looks so good or
hazel I'm sorry out of these lies are
mmm so guys now we're gonna take this
shade Jack Frost on a little more feet M
210 which is like a packing brush I'm
gonna put on the inner corner and the
brow bone we're gonna use this to
highlight it's a go white with golden
reflect it's literally a white with gold
reflect so that's so pretty
oh my gosh I love that feeling jolly is
fuck bitch come on fucking Santa Claus
like it really opens up the inner corner
look at that shit holy fuck hey guys I'm
gonna go do my eyeliner and do some
mascara and lashes off of camera and
I'll be right back okay guys so we have
the eyes completely done now and so what
they look like I think it's so pretty
this is a look I love doing I love a
really really warm smoky eye that has
like a really fun like pop of color on
the lid uh what do we think of the
naughty and the nice bounce guys what do
we think I think the quality is
fantastic I think they really have set
up the quality a lot in the shadows of
Kylie cosmetics I mean I think I always
thought that they were pretty good like
they're pretty okay always I feel like
these palettes if they have been doing
are so good so for me personally I would
purchase the nice palette for $44 I
think this is a great great great
palette I would not purchase the naughty
palette just because I don't like the
color scheme as much if you do enjoy
this color scheme of the naughty palette
this guy right here
go ahead purchase it I'm sure the
quality would be absolutely just as
amazing swatching them they swatched
beautifully so I would suggest if you
wanted to but for me personally I would
go with the nice palette and not the
naughty palette so now we're move on to
the lips a little bit so we have a
couple things for the lips actually we
have the sugar lips ed we have the spice
lip set which is this here here sugar
spice ah such a cute fucking condom this
whole entire collection I think is very
cute and then we have a velvet liquid
lipstick and lip liner in the shade
random elevate so these are the three
lip items off so let me just include
this and show you guys it does come with
a bag Kylie did release a green
bag for holiday this season so I think
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna swatch the
sugar liquid lipstick collection on my
lips I'm gonna do the spice on my arm
and I'm also gonna do the red velvet on
my arm as well so we're going to go
right into the swatches there's on what
the glosses let's go in start with the
glasses first these are the two glasses
that it comes with we have the gloss
butter and we have the gloss sugar here
we have the golden gloss and basically a
white gloss like dessert that's just
what it is like Kylie glasses a lot well
we have a pink reflect it's pink
it's extremely glittery as we can see we
have sugar glass right here I think it's
a little intense not gonna I wouldn't
just wear this by itself I'd have to
wear it on top of something the color
itself is very pretty it feels very
comfortable on the lips so now we're
gonna go in with the gloss butter which
is a golden version of in that last one
take an old gold I see here we have
butter right here I want to see it gives
the exact same effect as the other one
did this is a little bit more golden
it's a little bit more warm toned than
the last one but this is a butter feels
exactly the same because what we have
next we have a liquid lipstick in here
and we have a matte lipstick in here and
we also have another Belle bit in here
so we have two Velvets and one matte in
this entire set we have savage angel and
boy bye they'll Velvets first because it
is easier to take off so I'm gonna go
ahead and swatch savage on the lip right
now well that's nice and here we have a
savage savage we have savage and this is
the shade it's a beautiful fucking like
warm it's basically just a warm pain
okay next we're gonna do boy buy which
is another velvet really quickly it's
like a cool toned very wearable pink has
like a purple undertone to it though I
think yeah cool toned for sure sure this
shit is like pink and purple I don't
know fucking fuchsia so here we have boy
bye oh that's not good on that side
bitch bah huh
and here we have it you guys we have a
boy bye this is it right here I live and
breathe and now we're gonna finish off
with this lip kit and we are gonna
finish it with angel matte liquid
lipstick which again is another warmer
pink this is a very very cohesive
lip thing so I'm gonna try this one
I've angel right here actually think
that angel was a color that Kylie has
done before in the past but I could be
wrong I don't know I do remember
actually really love the shades so much
it's looking pretty I love it I feel so
pretty in it like it's just a pretty
pink shade so angel right here it's a
matte liquid lipstick what I enjoy about
this set is that it has two Velvets
- glosses and a matte I actually much
more enjoy her glasses and her Velvets
over her matte formula I think they're a
little bit drying that's just me
personally I'm sensitive to the over
drying of liquid lipsticks sometimes I
definitely think that one of these
should have been taken out and had it a
different color and it may be something
more deep a little bit more wearable for
a deeper complexions but that's just my
personal opinion let's go ahead and
swatch the spice kit on my arm really
quick so here we have Halle Berry which
is a matte liquid lipstick very very
pigmented no streaks at all holy shit I
like this color a lot mulberry right
there next we have a Juniper gloss right
here right there this little one needs
to be like played with first before you
actually hit music it's kind of stiff
it's basically like a clear gloss with
red marune flakes in it like glitter
particles so that is the color right
here we have a Juniper right there
next we have another gloss in the shade
cinnamon because this right here oh that
is beautiful
holy shit this is like a beautiful like
terra cotta Brown gloss so this would
look so so so good on a deeper
complexions like this would be the
perfect nude for if you're a little bit
dark deeper and complexion it's so
fucking nice so next we have the matte
liquid lipstick in the shade clove which
is so fucking beautiful holy shit I'm
not gonna watch it this way guys by the
way this clothes actually kind of hard
to describe you guys it's actually very
similar to the first shade the first one
is a little bit more berry a little bit
more pink and toned this one's a little
bit more neutral so as you can see right
there it's a little bit more of a brown
undertone and the first one's a little
bit more of a right undertone so it's
stunning though I have fucking love that
shade a little bit streaky er than the
other ones but it is beautiful and here
we have the shade goals you guys this is
it right here so very very very warm red
into pink some these days are so hard to
describe now like shit it's just getting
fucking real okay this sheet reminds me
kind of like a Kristen a little bit I
think okay you guys and last but not
least we have the velvet liquid lipstick
and lip liner do
right here in the shade red velvet which
is basically right I'm assuming I'm just
gonna do a little bit on the hand so you
guys can see exactly what it looks like
we have that lipliner and red velvet
right here let's go ahead and see what
this looks like right here it's
beautiful oh my goodness it's nice it's
like a fire engine red this is one of
those Reds that's like fuck me in the
fucking alleyway red you know I'm sayin
so then we have the liquid lipstick here
right there
full pic stunning swatch i mean i
swatched it so badly but it made me get
prettier I'm sorry we have red velvet
right there beautiful fiery right red
like stunning okay guys so what do we
think of the two sets what do we think
about this actually like the spice set
better I thought the colors were a
little bit better and I thought that
they were a little bit more nothing that
they're more cohesive but I think that
was a more of a variety I would say if
you are lighter income I wanna see if
you're lighter and complexion and enjoy
like nude shades a little bit more how
it go with the sugar set personally I
enjoyed the spice set more because I
thought was a pretty arrangement
I thought the arrangement was better
than the sugar one so you guys can't go
wrong with either of them it just
depends on the color selection that you
guys like okay guys and that is it for
today's video and all in all what do I
think of the entire collection I think
that Kylie did an amazing amazing job
this collection I really do I'm very
very very honest and brutal enough right
when I think about how these collections
just like how I am with Rihanna
I love Rihanna but it's something from
fenty Beauty came up I didn't like I
would say I didn't like it like that
doesn't mean because I like her doesn't
mean I'm gonna say like something you
know what I mean so I think that this
collection is great I really do I think
that was such a great concept and I
think Kylie cosmetics really really
killed it so congrats to you guys you
guys fucking slayed I would say is it
worth the bundle I would get it I don't
see one I don't personally like the
color of this bag by the way I know but
that's just my personal aesthetic that
is it for me you guys hope you guys had
fun watching it of course I will linked
these items down below if they are
available when this video goes up
actually I've no idea if it's gonna sell
our whatever the fuck but hope you guys
had fun watching as always have a great
rest of the night or day wherever you
guys are and I hope to see you guys in
my next video bye guys I love you blah
I'm trying to swatch no fucking I love
and lifting
because that would hurt my health but
you want to focus oh my word bitch who's
that bitch
yeah the voice is here and Sam had no
reason and I'm singing I'm gonna spray a
little bit of I shot out like a rocket I
think I fucked up this okay some follow
my fucking cheeks bitch little goopy
okay glittery flakes on my skin Hampi
