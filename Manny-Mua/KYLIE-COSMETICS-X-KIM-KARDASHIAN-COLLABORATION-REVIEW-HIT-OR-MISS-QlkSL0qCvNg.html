and Kim kardashian-west collection when
I first saw this I was actually so
freaking excited about it's actually
love Kim Kardashian I think she's so
smart I think she's so business savvy
and I think that she's a really
hard-working woman and I just really
appreciate that you can think whatever
you wanna think about her that's totally
fine I know that they are a
controversial family I say I guess I
would say you can say whatever hell you
want to say about them that's fine but
my personal opinion is I like the
Kardashians I like Kim i like Kylie I
think that they were very very very
hard-working
and I think that they really really made
a great life for themselves opinions are
like assholes everyone hath one but not
always pretty

by the way guys this was sent to me by
Kylie cosmetics is PR team I had no idea
Kylie even knows who I am at all but her
cosmetic team does send me PR so thank
you guys so much to the PR team for
sending me this I have been sent a lot
of Kylie cosmetics PR some things I
loved some things I have not loved I'm
always gonna keep it real and 100 with
you guys just because a brain sends me
something does not mean I'm going to
change my opinion and make it like
better because they sent it to me a
really that's not what it is ever that's
never how I've been and that's I'm never
going to be like that so don't worry you
guys definitely trust my opinion I have
been very very very real and brutally
honest about certain products and the
beauty
and some things have been from Heidi
cosmetics so toward disclaim that just
in case people are like you're sponsored
in case I do like these out if I'm like
them but just in case I'm like bitch
don't even try it
don't try it this is that like enjoy it
you know so this is the packaging this
sorta comes it comes like this beautiful
little matte soft pink packaging these
are the four guys right here is what
they look like adding their acted this
is what they look like right here I
personally think that this matte pink
packaging is so fucking nice like I
honestly love it
I do I don't know why I there's
something about this that just really
speaks to me the newness of this makes
me want to take off my clothes and get
fucking nude the shades are Kimberly Kim
keke and Kimmy and I think I mean they
all represent Kim's names or nicknames
or whatnot
these launched on April 25th at 3 p.m.
Pacific Standard Time and the four
lipsticks are going to be retailed for
$45 another thing this is a brand new
formula from Kylie cosmetics this is the
creme liquid lipsticks I tried her like
the lipsticks I tried to lip liners on
her glasses I've tried all of her stuff
and this is a brand new formula which
I'm really excited to try out as well
this has 11 ounces a product in it just
like her liquid lipsticks do in case you
guys wanted to know that I'm just
playing it so I know you guys are
probably like mani it's okay we get it
get the fuck on with it let's try on the
liquid lipsticks I'm gonna go from left
to right the most nude on and I'm gonna
try on the lik lipsticks right now on
camera so the first one we're gonna try
it is Kimberly which is actually the
shade I'm the most excited for let's put
out let's see what it looks like it
looks like this it smells like nothing
oh my god I smells like nothing oh it
makes me so happy I think Kylie
cosmetics is liquid lipstick formula
scent is a little too strong for me
personally I don't really like it so
this one's like nothing which I really
like let's just go ahead and swatch and
see what we think on bare lips or on
bare lips right now one swipe okay
that's what one dip we're gonna dip back
in because it's not the coverage I
wanted to be specifically okay guys and
this is the shade Kimberly it is on my
lips this is two layers of it on my lips
and honestly its pigmented and it's
fucking beautiful I honestly love this
color I really really do I feels
extremely
comfortable it went on very very creamy
and just like the liquid states like a
creamy creme creme creme ish finish non
sticky whatsoever there's a little bit
of build up in the center but I think
this could be except have too much on
wipes away pretty easily thing on
I'm not even dramatically I actually
live for this shit first one yes first
one to go
also that came off so easily which could
be a good thing it can be a bad thing
next we're gonna try the shade Kim looks
a bit Coral the last shade by the way
guys Kimberly that was like a very just
true nude color to me I had like a nice
really pretty pinky beige undertone and
that's just what it was it was a nice
just neutral nude shade this one in the
bottle to me looks a little bit more
Coralie let's go ahead and try this on
and see what Kim looks like once light
okay so this one is a little bit more
pastel and this is also a little bit
more streaky than the other one was I
think it's streaky because it's a creamy
formula it's glossy so it's just gonna
look that way do one more layer just
like I did with the other one gotta give
it a fair shot you know
Myrtle have to give it a fair shot and
this is what Kim it looks like on the
lips okay honestly I'm kind of shocked
because in this it looked a lot more
coral and I was like I'm about to make a
coral nude honestly it's not even Coral
at all it's like a peachy nude took a
really pretty peachy pink nude God this
color is fucking nice too god I don't
like that budget up here that kinda is
getting on my nerve that you have to
keep doing that
it went on similar to the last one
except it was slightly more streaky but
the effect after adding two layers is
the exact same feels very comfortable
okay guys next we have the shade Kiki in
the bottle it looks like like a much
more pinky toned nude so let's go ahead
and try this one home let's do this Kiki
I had nothing on it okay start from the
back there we go this won't really he's
really one layer it's more pigmented
than the other ones are it has more
coverage mm not that has more coverage
it's just a darker color I'm still gonna
add another layer though I would say in
the beginning when you're first applying
these liquid lipsticks that they're a
medium coverage but if you build it and
you do two layers you can build it to
full coverage and you get full opacity I
can't see I have like a freckle over
here on my lip and I can't see it
because it lipsticks there so I think
that's a good thing so I would say that
Kiki is just a babydoll pink nude
reminds me of the backdrop that I'm
using right now like it's just a baby
doll pretty pink nude this is the color
that I will probably not ever really
wear it's not my thing I think that's a
little bit too pink for me personally
but uh it's a beautiful color and I'm
sure a lot of people would absolutely
live and breathe and die for this color
so again it feels the exact same as
other two and last but not least we have
a Kimmie
which is the darkest of the four colors
this one looks like a I don't know in
the bottle honestly at this point I
don't fucking know I'm just gonna swatch
okay okay use the back of applicator for
more how weird is it that the back picks
up more than the front of the applicator
odd whatever and here we have the shade
Kimmie which is another beautiful
gorgeous nude shade two layers of this
on so pretty I think this color is
stunning oh my god I would say this is
much more of a rosy undertoned
nude it's darker and deeper it's a good
rosy terracotta nude that's what I would
describe this color as it's a rosy
terracotta nude
feels the same smells the same looks the
same on the lips beautiful glossy creamy
finish and yeah I think I have my
verdict guys okay guys I finished
watching all four colors I'm currently
right now wearing on my lips Kimberly
and Kim also one more thing that I
wanted to point out is skin tones when
it comes to this collection I do not
think that this range of colors is the
most suitable for darker complexions I
just don't that's just my personal
opinion I think that these colors are
really really light even the lightest
one Kimberly was looking a little light
on me and I was like I'm freaking pretty
light in complexion I just feel like if
you want to get this collection in your
doctor and complexion make sure that you
I rhymed make sure you have a darker lip
liner so really compliment it or just
put it on top of a lip liner but
all-in-all I am done with the swatches
and I finally have formulated my opinion
and what I think personally about this
collection with Kim Kardashian and Kylie
cosmetics are the mani MUA approved is
it a hit or miss for me and honestly
they're a hit I'm pleasantly surprised I
am pleasantly surprised I think that if
you're lighter in complexion this is a
great freaking bundle I think it's
awesome
when anything is fantastic personally
for lipsticks for 45 I think that's
really really fair it's like 11 bucks of
lipstick but if you are darker
complexion I do not think this is worth
it and I the only one of the shades is
gonna be able to work on you and so I
just really think you need to be
cautious about that by the way these are
not long wear liquid lipstick these are
a lipstick a cream lipstick and a liquid
formula that's basically what this is
this is not gonna be lasting six hours I
mean I could already tell that they're
feigning and this maybe lasts like an
hour on me you know I mean you have to
reapply which is really fine if you want
if you're the type of person that will
reapply throughout the day that's cool
I'm that kind of person I like to have a
beautiful lip effect and apply
throughout the day rather than drying
cracky and last me 12 hours like that's
just not that's just not what I go for
personally all in all I think it's a hit
I think that Kylie and Kim did a great
job on this collection and I really am
excited to see what they come out with
with the future stuff what the I have a
surprise coming I'm like very excited
about that I'm like okay what do you got
come in I want to see a whole I want to
see a whole range I want a family I want
highlighters I want the whole thing
honey so yeah guys I hope you guys
enjoyed this review and you found it
helpful if you guys want to buy it or
not I think we covered everything I
think we're pretty good oh I'll be a
