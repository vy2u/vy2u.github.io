as you guys can see from the title of
today's video today's going to be a
review and demo on the new cast shadows
palettes by Kylie cosmetics this is
called the bronze palette this is what
it looks like
Packaging killer palette adorable so
what I'm gonna be doing is going over
each shade what I think about each shade
how it works how pigmented it is how
powdery it is what I think about it and
then I'm also going to be doing the demo
on the eyes so the review part is gonna
be first and the demo parts in a second
so I will put exactly where the demo
part starts right here
so you just fast forward to this time if
you want to just see the demo and not
the review that's all good but I'm gonna
be doing the review first just a heads
up before I even get started on today's
video this was not sent to me I bought
this myself and not only did I buy
myself I bought it on eBay because I
cannot buy online Oh sold out so quickly
I bought on eBay for a hundred bucks
yeah I know yeah I know
oh I'm crazy I just really wanted to try
it out I just honestly I wanted to know
how it was I want to review it and see
if it was worth the 42 dollars that our
retails for so this is gonna be my
opinion on the palette and if you're
looking for me to bash on Kylie and her
brand this is not the video for you I'm
not gonna bash on her whatsoever
I know a lot people want to just believe
that she creates terrible products but
honestly dude like what she's 19
she's a multi-million dollar company
she's killing it and 19 how many people
can say they're killing it at 19 not
that many so instead of bashing on her
let's just think about that again she's
a young woman she's 19 she created this
cosmetic company it boomed right away so
question we some hiccups and mistakes
throughout the line but that's just what
it is people grow and people learn and
that's just how a cosmetic brand works
sometimes you're gonna have shitty ass
mistakes with your brand and sometimes
you're gonna kill it so that's just kind
of what it is that's just my opinion I
don't think people should be bashing on
anyone's cosmetics brand just because
they made one mistake or one mishap or
made one bad product that's just how it
is for all brands so if you're looking
for me to bash this palette that says
this is not the video for you I'm not
gonna bash it I'm just gonna give my
honest opinion and honest feedback of
what I thought about the shadows and how
they applied on to the eyes I am wearing
the entire palette all nine shades on my
eyes right now so let's go ahead and get
into this review as always if you guys
like this video if you guys don't like
me please don't watch it you
know the drill with that but if you guys
do like this video and you guys learn
something today please give this video a
thumbs up
and subscribe to my channel if you
aren't already and if you knew what's up
and rhenium your way welcome to my
channel thank you guys coming here and
yeah it's going into this review and
demo portion of the video
so let's go ahead and review it this a
bad boy now this is the packaging let me
show you the box that it comes with and
the little card it comes with this super
super cool card that does this like
really cool flip with the eye it opens
and closes I love the card that it comes
with and this is the packaging it comes
with its like this cool little bronze
metallic finish on the sides of the
pallet and it comes like this and just
goes the Iron Man has this really cool
bronze metallic effect on the eyes as
the tears I think it looks absolutely
amazing
you cleverbridge I just think the
packaging is actually quite amazing I
truly do and I think that it's a very
very very clever and kudos to Kylie
cosmetics for coming up with such a cool
packaging concept I actually love it the
thing I will say about the packaging I
don't like is that just says Kylie here
and doesn't have a mirror I think that
having a mirror in a palette is really
really really essential especially
people that are on the go and really do
need a mirror like when they're getting
ready so I think that having just the
word Kylie definitely isn't enough I
think that a mirror is definitely
necessary especially because the palette
is $42 and I'm like you can definitely
spend the extra cash that it takes to
put a mirror in all these palettes so
that's the only thing about the
packaging that I don't like is that it
doesn't have a mirror but other than
that I think it's so sleek it's so
beautiful has little Kylie XL on the
back I know you probably can't see it on
camera
but it's like a really cool foil to
finish on the back and it shows you
every single name of the palette it's
very similar to my palette in that way
and this is basically the exact same
component as my palette with makeup geek
it's pretty funny so we open it up and
we get to these shades you get nine
colors and you get seven mattes and to
shimmers and when I say shimmers I mean
it's a very subtle shimmer it's not a
bold intense shimmer at all it's not a
metallic finish it's a very just subtle
shimmer a sheen that's kind of what I
needed my shimmer so we're gonna go one
by one and just say what we think about
these shades so I'm gonna be just
watching with my finger and what the
brush and let's begin
so the first shade is the shade Jasper
it is a beautiful bone white shade this
could honestly be one of my favorite
shades in the entire palette it's
absolutely stunning it's a really
beautiful white it has like a subtle
cream finish as Matt it's very creamy
it's actually very blendable it has a
little bit of kick back with the powder
but it's not intense whatsoever and I
think this is honestly one of the best
shades in the entire palette it's
beautiful
okay what is next so next shade is
quartz and this is a
a pre champagne shades one of the two
shimmers in the palette this one I feel
does need some work in the palette I
don't think this gives off enough color
it's a really pretty shade but it is
such a subtle subtle Sheen that it could
almost be matte it's definitely not
shiny enough personally I just don't
think it has a big enough shine to be
called like a shimmer at all I think it
just has a very subtle Sheen it's very
just like it's very very subtle and it's
right something is very pigmented either
it's much more of a powdery shape so
that's what I think about quartz the
next shade is topaz is a really pretty
mid-tone cool brown and this one is
actually really pigmented so I do like
that I think it's a little bit powdery
and I think it can be a little bit
patchy very buildable color though the
next shade is the shade Goldstone this
one is the second shimmer in the palette
I would say the shade is a nice golden
bronze it is beautiful this would
actually have on my lid right now um but
it is just again not that pigmented I
don't think that it does give off a
really intense color payoff it's just a
very light sheen on the eye if you're
into it like a nice subtle sheen and if
you're not the type of person that loves
um really bold intense metallic eye this
is totally the shadow for you it's not
intense whatsoever I'm just gonna give
you a nice subtle sheen for the lid
nothing crazy
at all nothing crazy the next shade is a
shades too trying or Citroen I don't
freaking know is a really pretty just
pale orange shade it's gonna be a nice
transition shade actually have this all
over my crease right now going on with a
brush it does apply very nicely on the
eyes and it blends very very very well
it is definitely a nice pigmented
orangie type shade you're gonna
definitely get a nice color payoff when
you're putting this into the crease as
you can see it's almost like my most
prominent shadow in the crease because
it is so pigmented so I definitely do
like the shades to trine so train over
the frankest Kong and it does work
really well on the eye especially you
have colorize it's gonna make your eyes
pop so the next shade we have is the
shade tiger eye which is a nice matte
transition shade and this is a nice
medium maple kind of brown it's a very
warm neutral transition this is another
shadow that what that brush is applies
it very very very nicely on the lid
especially like a blending fluffy brush
it looks really nice this one is another
one of my favorites of the palette I
just think this is a really really
really pretty shade does have some kick
back but it's not terrible and I can
definitely work around it when the color
is really really beautiful
so I definitely like this shade for sure
the next shade is the shade hematite
which is a beautiful color the color
itself is absolutely stunning this is a
nice red and brown it's almost like a
red brick from Mac this one is the most
powdery of all of them it has a lot of
kick back I did use it today's look and
it does look absolutely beautiful on the
ladies on the outer corner out here just
kind of warms everything up it gives it
more of a red into tone when you're
putting it on with a brush in the eye it
does a beautiful next is the shade
bronze eye which is a nice dark
chocolatey Brown I like this color a lot
actually it's a beautiful darkened Brown
it literally looks like dark chocolate
it's another matte shade and it does
have the same kind of kick up as the
other shades do but it's not severe by
any means this what I think is really
really really pretty and I can
definitely see myself using this one a
lot more just to really define that
outer corner
so I did today in today's look I define
the outer corner with this one and I do
think this is a really nice shadow last
but not least actually last but least
mmm sounds terrible
the last shade is the shade obsidian
which is the black shade in my opinion
one of the most disappointing shadows
this is a black shade by Del T that's
pigmented at all I definitely think that
this shadow can use a lot more work it's
a black yes but it almost comes off as
grey I don't know has like a lot of blue
tone to a lot of grey tones to it I just
think that a matte black should
definitely be black I don't think that I
should be um patchy or gray I think that
should definitely be a black so of all
the shadows in the palette I think that
the black definitely needs the most work
I use it as my eyeliner today and it
took me about three layers to actually
get it pigmented enough where it would
look like a cool like shadow liner so
that kind of annoys me I want it to be
like a one and done pigmented enough for
that but it wasn't sadly so I don't I
don't think that shadow is really that
great okay so now what I think about it
is it worth it is it worth the purchase
so this is $42 do I think that this
palette is worth $42 no I don't sadly I
don't think it's worth $42 the packaging
is absolutely amazing you can create
some super cute looks with this palette
but I don't think that's diverse enough
to where I would justify spending $42 on
it for example you can buy a morphe 35o
palette and it's like 25 bucks and you
do the exact same look as this with a
morphe 35o you know what I mean so I
have a specific like criteria about
shadows I like to use and I use often
and whether or not I would actually
purchase them because I am a beauty
youtuber is what I do full-time and I
experimented with a lot of shadows in a
lot of different products because the
palette to me is not what I like enough
to spend $40 on it so if you're the type
of person that loves all mattes that
like loves a bronze palette blue things
that you'll use this palette every
single day because it is so everyday
appropriate then definitely is spending
$42 on this palette is definitely worth
it for you but for me personally I don't
think it's worth the 42 I think the
colors are beautiful I think that you
can create such a nice look with them
but I don't think you can create any lot
of luxe with them so yeah this is my
opinion that's my review on this part so
let's go and get into the eye demo
portion of this video okay cool so let's
get started on the tutorial portion of
today's look I have everything on my
face is completely beat to the
ground
and so I'm gonna go ahead and do just
the eyes on camera because this is going
to be a chi shadow review only and yeah
it's gonna get started with this
tutorial Alico so just so you guys know
my eyes are primed and everything is on
just how I should be normally we're
gonna grab a morphe 27 which is a normal
just casual fluffy blending brush we're
taking mixture of citron and a tiger eye
and then we're just going to take that
into the crease I'm noticing right away
as soon as I'm tapping on the brush
there is powder that comes up but with
most palettes shadows are powdery
consistency so powder is going to come
up so I understand thank you so I'm
gonna put this into the crease and see
how they blend the blend ability man it
is there it is there child oh yeah dude
they're pigmented like on the eyes I
wish that there was a lighter transition
color but you know what it's all good
we can make these work is you just have
to blend a little bit more and a little
bit longer I'm gonna take a little
packing brush this is the morphe r42
which comes out soon I'm gonna pack oh
my god the shadows nice Jasper oh this
is creamy as hell so I put that on the
brow bone to highlight it's a really
pretty creamy bone shade so there's we
just have so far
super easy to blend shadows honestly on
the eyes they blend pretty freakin
easily I'm impressed
I'm connecting the shade at Goldstone
which is a shimmer in this palette is
only two shimmers there's honestly like
no kick back with powder with this shade
which is nice the matte
a little bit more like kickback with
powder but Aussies on the batch I loaded
onto the brush let's see how it looks
swiping first yeah it's not oiled or
metallic in it by any means it's a
shimmer it's definitely not an intense
shade I don't click cool so this we
should have so far I'm gonna try to use
as many colors as I can from this
palette just so I can say that I did so
now I'm gonna go in with the shade
hematite which is a nice warm well
there's a lot of kick that is a lot of
kick back there's a lot of that one that
one is much more powdery shade as you
can see somebody talked more five four
three three that's gonna go on the outer
corner yes it's powdery as hell but
pigmentation is there you there's no
denying there's no 13 tonight the
pigmentation is they are dude for sure
so this color is hmm it's doing naughty
things to my eyes and I like it go ahead
and blend that out with an E 27 see how
this color blends nice that color blends
pretty cool so what you look like now so
now I'm taking more feet e36 and I'm
going to take the shade Bronzite I love
that all these things are so like
earthbender you know very avatar this is
up this was a pretty shade I think it's
going with nice so I'm put on the outer
corner just packing it on nicely on the
outer corner to give me some outer
corner definition pack down very nicely
it's very very pigmented so I'm liking
that taking that in four three three
just wiping off the excess product I'm
gonna go ahead and try to blend out that
nice warm Bronzite shade blends up very
nicely so I have a lot of shades on
right now so now I'm gonna go ahead and
tightline with the black shadow to give
me a nice just like winged appearance I
try to quickly a grab an angled brush
and I'm gonna grab the black shadow okay
sergeant's go in tight line with this
hmm so the shadow it's kind of coming
across as like a darker Brown it doesn't
really look as black as I want it to be
that's definitely not as black as I was
thinking I was going to get I was a
little bit darker and go set a little
shadowing you guys know I live for a
shadow and you guys know I live
for that
let's shadowing this bitch out okay
supposed to look something like this
okay great so we have these shadow wings
on this is what it looks like so
honestly it's been smooth sailing until
we got to the black shade I think the
black shade definitely needs a lot of
work
it's not pigmented enough by any means I
in my personal opinion I really had to
build like maybe three layers to get it
to this color I don't know it's kind of
patchy but if you build it you can
definitely get to a nice opaque layer
but it did take me a little bit of
building to get there so I think I'm
gonna make this a bad boy a pretty smoky
I'm gonna smoke it out down on the lower
lashline as well I'm gonna take the
ardency in a smooth ride to supercharge
gel liner this is my favorite eyeliner
for the waterline and jacket tell me
about this eye liner a while back and
actually let me use it when I was at her
house and it's literally one of the best
eyeliners I've ever used ever ardency
Inn has beautiful products I just get my
affiliate with them I don't leave myself
their products are pom
but yeah I can use a code manually way
if you want to save 15% off their stuff
I'm gonna take the e36 blend out the
black gel liner before Drive luckily
this liner is extremely extremely creamy
so you have a good amount of leeway time
before you have to make sure that it's
um blended out which is nice I'm gonna
take the shade topaz and that's gonna be
blended underneath my lash line this is
a nice cool toned Brown I'm also gonna
bring in a little bit of the shade
hematite to make it nice and warm making
sure that there's a nice blend between
the black gel liner and the shadows to
have a nice blended a smoky eye pretty
dude
okay kilometre fierce other eye real
quick okay cool so I put on a pair of
house of lashes iconic lashes to go with
this look at that would go really really
well because it does flare Oh at the
ends and I think this look just
collectively flares out at the end I was
just gonna keep my look at this but I
really want to try to use every single
shade so I'm gonna take the shade quartz
which is a like very soft champagne
shimmer very very soft and so I'm gonna
put that on the inner corner of my eye
just so we can this has some kick back
to it but not as bad it's a little
powdery but we can Duffing it through it
so go put that an inner corner honestly
I don't even know this make a difference
at all this shadow is very very subtle a
little bit on the brow bone I'm just
very little at the top point okay cool
so this is the final look lemis of you
guys in to see what it looks like up
close
awesome so the eyes are done I'm gonna
finish off with the lips really really
quickly
I've waiting the Urban Decay lipliner in
the shade stark naked I've been really
really loving this lip liner recently
sometime just live by my lips really
quick pretty subtle overdraw today nope
I thought it was in me subtle but it it
just I just went there I just it we went
there yeah so just outline the perimeter
of my lips and just kind of slightly
fill it in and then I going with another
first impressions also from Kylie
cosmetics so I bought the palette on
eBay for a hundred bucks because I
really just wanted to have it I really
wanted to try it out and see how it was
so I bought that palette and the Bresson
was just sweet enough to send me the
kylie gloss in the shade like so I
thought that was really cool so I'm like
might as well try on the glosses well
I've never tried any of the glasses
because I was never really interested in
her glosses I just heard so many mixed
reviews and I was like you know I'm not
really that interested in her glasses
but I'm going to try it out today the
wand is completely fine good thing this
is like a darker gloss if that was me a
little lighter cool okay we're gonna go
with that smell like this smells exactly
like her liquid lipsticks but the
pigmentation of these glasses is some
via and a good way looks good
you know I think would look really good
with this gloss color Patrick think he
would love this
the gloss feels very nice it's a very
very pigmented it's not sticky
whatsoever
it feels very smooth and it goes on a
very very very opaque right away which I
like honestly I'm nothing bad to say
about the gloss other than the smell I
don't know how long they last on my list
because I just put it on right now
not too shabby I like it and that is it
for today's video guys hope it was
helpful for you guys if you guys were
interested in buying the CAI shadow
palettes I'm not telling you guys to buy
it or not I'm just letting you guys know
what my opinions are on the palette so
guys want to buy it hell yea more power
to you if you guys don't want to all
good as well oh yeah this is just my
opinion on the palette do I like it yeah
I like it I think it's a pretty good
palette but do I think it's worth $42 in
my personal opinion I don't it's a
little bit more on the pricey side but
if you guys are interested in a bronze
everyday palette that's very just
neutral and not too crazy it's a good
pad for you guys I'm
head out to LA now I've just been I took
