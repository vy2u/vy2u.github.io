GBC today's video is going to be a
review of the new Kylie cosmetics Cairo
palette in the burgundy shade the
burgundy palette okay I was so ecstatic
when I realized that this was sent to me
I had no no idea I was gonna get a PR
package with the burgundy palette and
the new liquid lipsticks I was actually
little shook because I didn't order them
they were just sent to where I get my
product sent to and I was like how did
this even get here no idea what I still
to this day I never got email from Kylie
cosmetics or anything it was just head
to my house and honestly I'm not
complaining at all that is cool
but yes even though the product was sent
to me the palette was sent to me I'm not
going to like say oh my god it was so
amazing because we're sent to me no
that's not how I work that's just not
what it is at all if I like the pot I
like if I don't then I don't and that's
just what it is there's nothing wrong
with having a different opinion opinions
are like assholes everyone has one not
all of them are pretty let's be
real but yeah as always if you guys saw
this video if you guys don't like me
please don't watch it you know
the drill with that I say in every
single video you know the drill
by now come on now but if you guys like
this video please give it a thumbs up
and subscribe if you aren't already
subscribed to any channel and if you're
new what's up I'm an emu a and thank you
so much for being here I am going to be
reading the new burgundy palette by
Kylie cosmetics so it comes in that
really really cool packaging like I did
last time this is the cute little box
the Chi shadow pressed powder eyeshadow
palette as you can see this is a rose
gold finish on the outer packaging this
time and then this one is same aspect to
the last palette as well if this one has
more of a rose tone that drips to it
which is absolutely stunning and I love
it just like last time I loved it the
packaging I thought was so innovative
and so cool and so unique and I love
that she differentiated this palette
with the last one by doing the different
colored foil drips to open up the
palette same thing exact same component
as the last Kylie palette fine shades no
mirror in the palette I wish it did have
it this retails for
least favorite shade in the entire bunch
it's a very just lightweight tan shimmer
color it's not like shimmery where it's
like BAM shimmer it's like a light
subtle like Sheen to the look it's not
my favorite thing but I believe that she
did create this shadow in mind of people
that wanted just a very lightweight like
light shadow on the lid which totally
makes sense for me personally I just
know I'll never use it so it's like oh
it's annoying to me but it is a
beautiful color it's just not my cup of
tea
cool cool so next shadow is going to be
the shade beech which is a beautiful
orange e tan brown shade right here just
watch with my hand I feel it always feel
 good I must watch with my finger
right here beautiful it is beautiful oh
my gosh I really really like this shade
so much just no patchiness in this for
me there's no patchiness as you can see
that you can see there's no streaks in
my hand it's a straight-up swatch no
streaks it is in my crease and it looked
great it blended fantastically so I
really have no complaints is a very nice
burnt orange tan color and that is a win
for me guys a go that is a go honey next
shade is the shade at penny and this is
a very rustic orange shade so so pretty
to go right into orange will swatch over
here
come on so pigmented oh my goodness the
shadows are extremely smooth extremely
soft I feel like the mattes and this one
are better than the mattes in the last
palette because again they are smoother
they are softer they have less kickback
and I really really liked that this
shade penny is a win for me there's also
in my crease right now it's like the
orange you shade you guys see in my
crease I love a nice rusty orange red
tone so chic that's matte so I love that
next we have this shade la which is this
really pretty copper bronze shade I'm
gonna swatch it this one feels so
 good look at this look at this
 shade this is a foiled finish
which you guys know I'm screaming for
it's oh oh my beachy way look up that is
a beautiful color this is actually the
color I'm wearing on my later right now
I use it with a brush I didn't use with
my fingers and it was it's this
pigmented so I'm very very very much
impressed that is my I love that
shape so so so much so far the only code
that I do not like is naked so that's
one of the four every other color so far
has been a go so next is the shade of
Burgundy which is a very pretty pink
it's actually literally like a pink
raspberry you can see beautiful
beautiful raspberry pink shade it's not
bargaining me whatsoever it's like a
pink raspberry I really feel like highly
picked it up in this formula I'm
impressed
Kylene creme so that shade of
Burgundy is another go it's absolutely
beautiful it feels a very very creamy
and it doesn't pick up powder like the
other shades work so I definitely do
think that this palette is already so
much better than the last palette the
last one I did like I just didn't think
was worth the money but so far this one
is actually worth the money to me so we
just watched five of the shadow so let's
see the other four and see how they play
out so now here is the shade do by
filling it with my finger another
beautiful foiled feeling
gorgeousness so what it looks like I
would say this shade is like a very
pretty foiled rose shade it has like a a
little bit of pink reflect a little bit
of gold reflect so it's like a rose gold
but much more rows than gold so I would
say another banger this is a beautiful
shade I really wanted to put this on all
over my lid but the golden was really
just speaking to me so I haven't you
still called you know I just
like the shimmers in this palette so
much more so much more than the last
palette like these shimmers are actually
like shimmering and intense other ones
weren't as intense for me and I love
intense bold reflection next shade is a
shade of brick and this is another match
shade this is a really pretty red and
brown this is much more Brown though
this reminds me of Swiss chocolate by
Mac I'm gonna swatch it right next to
Dubai
that's a horrible swap meet
while I begin let's try that again
so what the shade looks like right here
it's a very pretty reddened Brown again
very similar to Mac Swiss chocolate
it's literally like the same
coloured me it's hilarious actually had
it on the outer corner of my eyes today
to blend in with that really pretty
penny shade it just looks so mmm so nice
and I feel like the blend so well the
shadows here the mats are much softer
than the last one which I feel is just
odd because usually when it's softer
there's more kickback but there's less K
back in this palette that was last one I
don't know I don't know if you did it
it's like I'm up next shade is the shade
of New York and this is a what is this
feeling it feels like a
just good just glue let's
go and swatch your ring yeah yeah see
that right there beautiful this is a
true topi bronze shade much more foiled
than the other palette is it's not as
intense it's not as shiny as those other
colors are but it is another beautiful
shade it's a really pretty deep bronze
gold can s you have to hold gold so
pretty another banger though I do think
this is a really pretty color I want to
put this all over my lid as well but I
only have one lid I can't put that many
colors on me because there's only one
New York is another go I don't know why
I'm saying that's a go but that's just
my thing today and last but not least
this is the shade almond and this is a
really pretty dark dark dark very
plumage Brown it reminds me a lot of
Aphrodite from my palette which on this
beautiful deepened Flemish Brown so
pretty very very very soft lightweight
matte shade it's not intense by any
means it doesn't feel bad it doesn't
feel gross it's a very soft feeling
which I really really enjoy it's because
almond and brick are actually really
really similar they're only up by a
couple of tones like they're very very
very very simply almond on the outer
corner of my eye to deepen everything I
don't have any black or different
shadows on my crease or anything like
that - making it deep it was just using
almond and it really did work to make it
look nice and dark and intense and had a
lot of depth to the look so again almond
is another banger I think that turned
out beautifully and this is the final
look using the Kylie cosmetics Burgundy
palette obviously I'm wearing lashes
right now and I have liner on and I
added a little bit of highlight to the
inner corner and to the brow bone
because the shadow naked in this palette
is not my favorite the lashes I'm
wearing actually in today's video Miami
by Lily lashes if you guys are curious
well lashes I'm wearing Lily lashes
Miami you can use a code man um your way
to save some money because I'm
interested in it I just like this pair a
lot they're very wispy and intense and
they're so glam so again all in all this
palette retails for $42.99 a naked and
that's just not my cup of tea
I don't like shades like that I don't
like a very soft like almost not there
shimmer I want either matte or I want
intense shine I don't want any in
between that's just my personal
preference though but I do think that
this palette is
she worth the 42 bucks unlike last time
I didn't think it was worth it but this
one I think is look at it just so it's
so pretty these are the kind of tones I
love these are so beautiful to me this
is like my bread and butter this
I write out on my I bread and butter as
my about amar I do think it is
worth the price and I would buy this
personally I was gonna buy it it just so
happened to be sent to me so I'm
impressed with this palette much more
than I am impressed with the last one I
feel like she picked it up and it's just
better I just what it is it's better
it's actually worth the price this time
and the other one I just don't think it
was so that is just my honest opinion
and yeah guys that is it for the entire
video I hope you guys enjoyed watching
