so today's video I'm actually really
really excited to be filming this video
so I asked you guys a lot of questions
on snapchat and Twitter to gauge with
you guys what you guys would like to see
me doing and I asked you guys on Twitter
who like me to see using the new Kylie
cosmetics blue honey collet so I'm
actually going to an event right now and
I got this in the mail today and I was
really intrigued by it so it's already
gonna film a look with it why not show
what I do with the palette also I really
wanted to do a little side by side
comparison and swatches and things like
that of the dream street collaboration
with Kathleen and color pop versus and
be Kylie cosmetics blue honey palette
because a lot of people were saying that
they are really really really similar in
color scheme and I was like oh my god
they kind of are similar in color
schemes I'm actually really excited
about this color scheme and think it's
beautiful I've not been excited about
Kylie palette like this sends like the
nice palette and back in like December
which is like not far away
anyway I think that she has really great
palettes I think that the quality has
really really been stepped up in her
shadow realm which I'm so excited about
because you see the prices of her shadow
palettes are about like 40-something
bucks
as always if you guys don't like this
video you guys do not like me please
don't fucking watch it you know the Jo
with that torrents but you guys do like
this video go ahead subscribe to my
channel if you're not already and if you
knew what's up am anyway and welcome to
my channel thank you so much for being
here
but yeah it's going get into this review
on the caddy Cosmetics blue honey
palette I'm just gonna be using it as
well it's gonna be like a review and
more like Tryon also I'm gonna try to
use the dream Street one as well and
seeing if like I can do the same look on
both eyes I don't really know that's
impossible
we'll see
the blue honey palette launches on one
23:18 which is coming up really really
soon doctor you don't even know this
videos going up before or after 123 take
my word for a grain of salt I don't know
for a fact that they are the same price
as the other nine shadow palettes
because I can't find the price point on
her Instagram this is the color scheme
right here let me show you guys there is
no mirror in this I wish there was but
this is the color scheme I think it's
beautiful
I'm really into this like I'm just
really really into it so now let's go
ahead and take a look at dream Street
which is this palette right here this is
the color schema for this palette again
also very fucking similar in color
scheme to the Kylee palette this one
retails for $16 and comes with 12 shades
of course these are much smaller in pan
than the Kylie cosmetics one as you can
see right here the pan sizes are quite
different so basically all we have to
know is that the Kylie cosmetics shadows
are basically double the size of these
guys and it comes with nine and the June
Street comes with 12 so I'm going to go
ahead and swatch the clothes that I
would say are a little bit similar we
have this shade right here swatching it
feels amazing feels quality is fun that
one to me looks really similar to this
one I mean just look so similar like
Jesus Christ but like this one feels
great it feels actually like very much
the same I'll swatch them and then I'll
show you guys after hang because
honestly it is so I'm gonna swatch the
lightest shade here and the Shea that's
in Kathleen's pout that's closest to
that one which is a dis Carrie here
one's a matte and one's a satin shimmer
so who's gonna be fuckin different okay
when you're watching oh yeah now we're
gonna go ahead and swatch this one oh
that's a pretty fuckin shade miss Kylie
Jen so looking at Kathleen's powders not
a shade that would be comparable to that
one that one is its own little field I
guess I'll do one that's as close it's
gonna be which is gonna be the top right
one right here it's much more orange
much more warm but this is now we're
gonna swatch the Kylie gold
Oh Kylie's really doing the thing with
this palette I'm kind of moving let's
just see the first round of swatches
real quick I want to show you guys come
in our arms basically all tatted up from
swatches so we have all the ones on the
left are kylie palettes and all the ones
on the right are color pop so this is
what they look like right here we have
the one that Sagamore mustardy orange
shade right there we have like
a nudie color right here we have like
this shimmery satin taupe shade right
here which is not similar to this one at
all
this one is Kylee this is color pop the
gold one not the same these guys are
actually more different than I thought
they were gonna be this is Kylie this is
more of a seafoam green shape this one's
like a deep dark blue fucking depth of
the ocean and then we have Kylie right
here which is a really cool green gold
reflect and then we have this one here
from colour-pop which is a black with a
blue reflect in it as i'm swatching the
Kylie shades and those watching the
Claire pop shades they're both beautiful
like I'm actually really happy with the
quality of both of them a swatch pretty
similarly to be honest they're not with
that different in swatch of course
there's some different finishes but it's
pretty like pretty similar so we have
the final three complete this is what
they look like on the arm Kylie Kylie
Kylie clip pop color pop color pop to
let you guys see for yourselves what
they look like in comparison this is the
deepest shade from colour-pop this is
the deepest shade for Kylie the two
shimmers these are like more copper
orangie shimmers this one's much much
much more pink and red than this one's
more of a true copper and then we have
okay guys I'll take with that as you
will I honestly do think that there are
a lot of similarities to these two
palettes as i'm swatching the kylie one
i know that the quality is great so if
you did want to buy the Cutty one that's
great - you're gonna get a great palette
so I'm actually really happy with both
of them but if you do have dream Street
with by Kathleen and Claire pop I would
honestly just skip out on the kylie one
that's just my personal opinion they're
similar enough where you can get by but
I was thinking I'm like I'm gonna be
able to do a full look like side-by-side
and you guys aren't gonna know what's
Kylie and which one is color pop but I'm
like you know what no cuz I really
wanted to do like a look that's cohesive
and like good you know I'm saying like I
want to do like a nice ass look so I'm
not gonna do that because I'm also going
out after so I'm like bitch I'm not
gonna fuckin do to their eye looks right
now I'm not doing that
right now so I'm just really bad at
reading like the back thing come into
comparison to what this is I just wish
that these fucking pallets had the
goddamn name on the thing maybe this is
just like the stock component and they
add the little things depending on what
colors are in and she's has like a
million of these sitting around and
that's why they have a little sticker on
the back that would swear my daughter's
and that's why they probably don't have
the names on them because there's stock
component but anyway these two are
obviously like calling my name like so
hard just fucking do it in like
honestly though we're gonna go and just
take the pallet guys we're just gonna
play we're gonna have fun this is
basically gonna be a get ready I already
swatched them I think they swatch
beautifully I think the quality is
really really nice just like I do with
the Kathleen palette and I've already
actually done a hole into our video on
Kathleen's collection with color pops
you guys want to see that I'll leave
that link down below that's why I'm not
talking about this one as much because
I've already done an entire video on it
I do want to just show the comparison
swatches between the Kylie palette and
in the color pop one so you guys could
have a reference I want to do it go
gracias say hey look if you guys don't
know
Rocio sara is you should she's amazing
and she's just really talented and she's
so sweet
if I talked to her before and snapchat
and she's like the sweetest thing but
she's also very iconic with her looks I
think that they're very very unique I'd
unless you deserve some recognition so
I'll leave her handle to her Instagram
right here so you guys can check it out
so I'm gonna try to look like hers not
something colorful but her style if it
doesn't turn out it's all good at the
end of the day Rocio you're fucking
sickening and if you see this let me
shit so I'm gonna go ahead and go in
with a more feet m5o for some things
she's raw and sweet like honey oh my god
your name is she draw that is nasty I'm
just kidding no be safe kids out there
if you're having sex you shouldn't you
should be abstinent you know especially
if you're younger be fucking abstinent
please it was actually really crazy
random sight now and I didn't really
think I was ever talked about this I
might have a little bit but not like
really on my channel actually just
started taking the prep which is
basically like a drug that prevents HIV
exposure to the body and as you guys I'm
sure know HIV is like a very prevalent
seeing in the gay community of course it
is also in these straight communities as
well the heterosexual community it's
very prevalent there as well there's
this stigma of gays getting HIV and AIDS
in it's just it really sucks but that's
I mean it is what it is that's the
stigma behind it and I wanted to just
talk about the fact that I do take prep
myself because if you're sexually active
I'm not saying I'm sexually active all
the time like Jesus but I am sexually
active enough where I would want to take
it and be as safe as possible
because basically it's a drug that you
take and I'm not pushing drugs bitch I'm
not pushing drugs on you whatsoever I'm
a sudden you guys know this is something
I do take I just feel more responsible
taking it so this is like I guess it's
just kind of like my way of saying that
I'm being safe and protecting myself in
the ways that I know I can also it's
about using condoms and being dumb
obviously I'm not being stupid and I'm
just like Willy
you're fucking doing having unprotected
sex all the time or anything like that
you know as long as you're being safe as
long as you guys are being careful out
there if you guys are sexually active be
safe please I'm taking a morphe r39
and I'm taking this shadow right here
which is called honeymoon I believe and
I'm taking out a Murphy r39 a really
good dense packing slash blending brush
a lot of you guys know I have like a
medical background like I wanted to go
to med school so anything like this like
talking about like things body-wise that
are important like st eyes and you know
things like that i just think it's like
important to bring up even though it's
kind of uncomfortable it's like
something that you like don't really
want to talk about you know I've been
lucky enough to have never gotten STD or
STI my own hole into our life and I've
been blessed along the way because I've
been like safe and being smart about
different things even if you did get one
it's like don't be too like hard on
yourself you know things happen mistakes
are made and do better next time and you
hopefully learned from that mishap you
know I'm saying I feel like if you
didn't know me and if we just sort of
watch me like if you just watching my
video right now for the first time you
would never think that I'm like over
here have like Bachelors of Science
degree and I was like literally in the
process of going to med school or like
applying for medical schools for like
programs to go into programs for medical
school like watching me now you would be
like the bug you were yeah I was fucking
weird thinking about like that's like
that was a whole new life it literally
feels like an in completely different
life to me it's like the most bizarre
thing okay let's go ahead and take some
concealer we're gonna carve some bitches
out I'm actually on take a little bit of
a Kiley concealer I feel like the reason
I like this concealer to like kind of
carve out like a crease or do anything
like that is because I feel like it's
very very liquidy I don't really mind it
you know I'm gonna dry so nicely and I'm
taking this on a Smashbox lip brush
actually I'm doing that go full like cut
crease moment with it you can make your
cut crease go anywhere you want and
literally like it this is like something
that like doesn't have any rules you
know I'm going above my crease I just
kinda wanted to put it in here as I want
it to be don't really vet that for now
the cool thing about what we're Osio
does just like this cool thing where she
leaves like the middle a bit kind of
like a floating country situation I'm
not too good at it's not something I've
ever like really practiced I've done it
like one time burn try doing today do
it's really cool to him is to see how
many amazing up-and-coming beauty
bloggers and vloggers there are Beauty
vloggers I'm not even talking about
bloggers
to be honest but it's so amazing to see
these people come into the beauty space
and just fucking start killing it and do
their thing and then there's and they're
just like cool and they're fuckin cool
people like honestly like for example
talking about Rocio who I think is just
actually an amazing sweet person
Rob Beauty Christy's another one who I
just left so much and she's like the
sweetest thing
Alissa ashley is another person who I
literally gag for like y'all understand
I want to fucking collab with Alissa to
be honest like I need to get that shit
fucking rolling because I think she's
the sweetest thing I'm not saying you
get burnt at all by the same people all
the time but it does get quite
repetitive when you're seeing the same
people over and over again at different
events and things like that and I'm
gonna think it's bad don't get me wrong
like I live for seeing the people I see
and I love like having the friends that
I have and I'm so lucky to have the
people I've met in the community and
like everyone's been I mean a lot of
people have been great to me but it's
nice to get some fresh faces and fresh
looks and fresh outlooks on different
things and getting different
perspectives you know I really hope that
those people I just mentioned along with
so many others I can't even think about
right now really continue to just to
grow and kill it and do their thing and
I hope that they continue on and just
keep fucking impressive you bet you
choose fucking hard you know it's hard
game it's a hard fucking bitch and
people can be really rough and really
vicious and really just downright mean
there's a lot of shitty people in the
community so it's nice to be able to
meet people that are coming into the
space that are just good I mean after
the whole tart foundation Fiasco I feel
like we really need to focus and get
these brands to realize that it wasn't
18 like we're not just we're not taking
anyone shit we're just not this is not
the year for shit taking like we did
that in 2017 we've got our moment with
our shit moment you know and we're not
gonna do that this year is deal with
bullshit from brands that are well-known
and now I'm gonna do the lid moment
rocío if you're watching this I'm sorry
if I'm like doing you dirty like this is
not something I do normally I take this
shade right here this was in the shade
buzz off there's like that really pretty
topi stunning shade I'm gonna put that
on the center all I'm saying is I'm very
excited to see what the future in the
beauty world holds I think it's gonna be
really really great here you know
something it's something like this it's
um
along these lines she doesn't more cunt
than me of course but uh I'm gonna do
the other eye off of camera I just
finished up my makeup look a little bit
and we will be back very soon okay so we
have both of the tops of the eyes that
done right now this is the moment we
have going because I'm gonna do the
bottom of the lashes as well I'm gonna
do the bottom lash line I really do want
to incorporate the blue like blue Maji
type shades as well so I'm going to use
those I'm gonna take a little bit of the
middle one which is the blue honey and
I'm gonna take that underneath my lash
line on the outer corner right now here
its own little moment and I'm gonna mix
the shimmery shade with it bumble or
royal jelly I'm gonna mix that one in on
the inner part of the eye a little bit
of a sheen as well I guess we're really
taking either tonight you guys am I
going to the Sony event where Kelly is
performing and I guess we're doing a
whole moment tonight I want to see a
little bit of a gradient effect it's a
little bit lighter and doesn't machine
to it and then we have to look down
bitch I'm just gonna highlight the brow
bone
- it's like Nicki we're in taking miss
good ole nikkietutorials glow goals cuz
that shit is blinding AF the she is wild
like this is wild okay hmm I'm playing
this with a more p.m. to 10 brush you
guys knows like when my favorite brushes
of all time now we are done with I
officially I'm gonna go ahead and do
some eyeliner and lashes off of camera
now be right back and we'll finally talk
about the verdict of this palette
whether or not I think this is you guys
so this is the final look I have
everything on right now I added a little
bit of Mac reflex pearl on the center of
the lid just to give it a little bit
more of a pop and a little bit of
Midnight Cowboy by Urban Decay on the
inner corner just for a little bit more
of a glittery moment and Anasazi honey
on the lips stunning looking fuckin
pretty the eyes are done Oh Lily lashes
Miami on the eyes and yet guys so I
finally have the verdict we are done
with this entire video what do I think
of B Kylie cosmetics blue honey palette
honestly guys this is a total hit for me
I think it's really really nice I think
the quality is great the shimmers are
really nice the mats are really nice and
I really like that they did five mats
for shimmers it's actually funny because
you look at it the four edges like north
east south west are all shimmer
and the five other ones that going in
like a diagonal like an X are all matte
I think that's kind of cute I don't know
I think that right now they blended very
nicely they look really really pretty on
the eyes I think they look turnout
fucking sickening but is the Kathleen
lights palette with color pop a do for
this palette honestly I would say it is
if you guys are interested in the Kylie
palette which is a great quality and you
guys want to buy it because it's a
Kylie's brand and you love her shadows
amazing please go out and buy it if you
guys want to but if you guys do have the
dream Street collab by Kathleen has
color pop and you guys have these shades
already you can definitely achieve a
look very similar to this with the Dream
Street palette so all in all the Kylie
panel is great the color palette is
really great I just wanted to do a
little side-by-side comparison if you
have the color pop one you don't really
need the Kylie win and yeah I'm gonna go
ahead out to my event right now I bitch
spray this anyway I'm gonna go ahead out
to my event I need to get dressed and
get going as always have a great tonight
or day wherever you guys are and I will
catch you guys in my next video bye guys
I love you come on star second video of
the day feeling my fucking
swirly intro commences you're not fuckin
fat oh my god I need a ype eat my ass
like it's fine let's just do the damn
thing
okay guys so this is the final look on
the eye on the mouth on the face on the
taint mmm she's feeling her oh honey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
