such a creep anyways you guys I've not
filmed in literally two weeks it's been
so long I've been traveling a
lot recently and I know I'm always like
telling you guys I've been traveling a
lot recently I apologize but whenever I
come back from traveling I'm always like
like I just feel like refresh like I'm
just ready to film and ready to get
going and ready to just kind of work and
do my thing here with you guys but I'm
excited to be filming today especially
I'm even more excited to be filming
today because today's video is about the
Laura Lee Los Angeles cat's pajamas
palette so before we even get started on
that this video before I even get
started on talking about the review of
doing that eyeshadows everything I just
wanna talk about something really
quickly because I'm sure I'm gonna be
getting this a lot I know a lot of you
guys are probably thinking like Manny
you're not gonna be giving an honest
review because Laura Lee's when you're
best friends and I totally understand if
I was you guys I'd be thinking the same
thing however throughout this entire
process of Glore creating her palettes I
have been with her throughout the entire
way literally the last year and a half
that she's been working on it or at
least the time that she's been showing
me samples of it I've been swatching
I've been playing with the shades I've
been writing them I've been using them
as much as I can to help her and give
her insight um and my opinion on the
shadows so when I talk about this
palette in a positive way if there is
one shade that I'm not like living for
as much there's like one shade that
thing is a little bit drier than the
others but other than that I think
they're amazing
that is why I'm talking highly of them
it's because I've actually been using
them in playing with them for so long
and I wouldn't leave Laura
astray you know what I mean like I've
been like working on my own brand and
working on my own thing and I have
collabed so many times and I know the
things I like I know the shadow quality
I like I know the kind of lipsticks I
like the kind of everything that I like
so I just have been helping Laura along
the way throughout this whole entire
experience and of course she's done it
all on her own
by herself literally no investors she's
done it 100% on her own and I just think
it's so commendable and honestly
if I didn't like this palette I wouldn't
be reviewing it right now I wouldn't be
talking about it because I think it's
really bad karma I think it's kind of
 up when you talk badly of other
youtubers collabs or their brands or
something like that I always just feel
like a little weird about it I just feel
like it's bad karma it's bad juju I do
not want that on me I would just rather
not talk about it I know I'm on this
like four-minute long tangent
right now I'm literally looking at the
viewfinder like god damn I'm on a
tangent but I just wanted to say that
because I really have been with her
throughout this whole experience and I
know how hard
worked on it and I know she's lost sleep
over it I know she's crying over this
probably I know so many like back end
things that she's dealt with coming out
this and coming out with her own brand
and doing this all on her own and her
int I worked so hard and so tirelessly
over this and I just wanted to reiterate
how proud I am of her and just know that
I've been using these shadows for a long
time where I've been watching them for a
long time I've been playing with them
for a long time but I've given her my
feedback and my opinion back to the end
of the day these are her shadows these
are her creations these are all on her
and I'm just gonna be trying them out in
today's video I'm going to using I'm
gonna be swatching them as well so yeah
you guys as always if you guys do know
like this video if you guys do not like
me please don't watch it you
know the Jo with that you don't do
anything but if you guys that do like
this video please subscribe to my
channel if you're not already and if
you're new what's up a man Iike me way
and thank you for being here on my
channel and watching this video I really
appreciate it
yeah guys let's go and get into this
review and demo on the new Laura Lee Los
Angeles Pig I still the flash on this
video I just wanted to say I would never
be dishonest with you guys in a review I
will never talk highly of a product
that's not something I love I will never
ever ever ever do that so basically the
only options for me are no video goes up
at all and I don't talk about it because
that's the only honest thing for me I
would never say a product is amazing
when it's not so basically that's the
only option that I give myself I just
don't allow myself to talk about
other youtubers products so I just end
up not doing a video if I don't like it
so this is the palette you guys this is
the Laura Lee Los Angeles catch pajamas
eyes shadow palette as you can see has
like this really cool flowery deco on it
with a embossed black logo with her logo
and the cool paint splatter on the back
which i think is really pretty cute
touch so you guys can see the back of it
right here this is what the palette
looks like itself it's right here
the lights are pretty bright I apologize
and it's like one of those reflective
cardboards so the unicorn itself is
pretty reflective so you can see here it
is also cruelty free and it's vegan
which i think is absolutely amazing so
this is the pal you guys this is so
excited I'm sorry like I don't mean to
be such a goober but I'm just really
excited and proud of her I see all those
comments on on trend moves page
or on like other people's pages like
those hating comments saying like they
can't believe a youtuber is coming off
that makeup line or they think it's
annoying or it's up and all these
youtubers come out with
Bran's button in the day the youtubers
are trying to make it to the trying to
be entrepreneurs are trying to have
their own life and they're trying to
have their own dreams come true so I
understand 100% if it's annoying to
people but I understand of course
because I am a youtuber I want to have
I'm gonna have my own brand - I want to
have my own experiences I want to have I
want to be my own CEO and I want to have
my own products out for other people to
love and enjoy as well not just Estee
Lauder's and Lori Elle's out there I
want to be my own little india brand and
i just think it's so cool that Laura's
taking that first step and she's already
come out with her own product and I'm
talking for Laura in this part a little
bit but I do feel like a big reason that
we are starting with our own brands and
we're kind of doing our own thing is
because of Jeffrey you know seeing
Jeffrey just be a boss ass bitch like me
and Laura want that like we want to have
our own brands they want to be able to
do that for ourselves as well so that's
why I feel like youtubers are coming out
with our own brands and they want to
have their own entity for themselves not
just a YouTube channel you know what I
mean so that's kind of why I want to
talk about to then a lot of people be
like I can't believe that youtubers
coming oh if I can begin
if that's what their dream is to have
their home brand didn't let them have it
you know so this is we have in the
palette right here we have the Aloha the
Los Angeles this is a really really
pretty glitter it's sickening it's like
the sickest beautiful nice
intense glare this reminds me a lot of
the Mac Moorea collection where it's
like they had that really cool intense a
glitter effect
reminds me a lot of that so it's like
that really cool glittery paper in this
in the daylight it's stunning we have a
cute little kitten like a little cat
here running with his little paws where
thing is a cute touch because Laura is a
 cat lady and we have cats
pajamas right here and we got this right
here we got 10 shades and I have used
this before as you guys can see this is
not a first impressions this is a review
I have used this I've worn this palette
several times and this palette retails
for $40 it is launching on October 13 I
believe it will be on Laura Lee Los
Angeles's website which is also her
merch site so that's where you're able
to find it anyway guys I'm going to be
doing the swatches first okay so that's
going to talk about each shade
individually before I start on with a
look
my eyes are you putting by the way so
we're just gonna do a fun the fall time
look I mean this is a very very very
fall palette first one we have the first
shade is okey dokey this is a really
pretty matte almost
satin finish cream shade it's super
pigmented
lightweight and it's a great base color
and it would work really nicely as a
highlight for the
phone or for the inner corner the next
shade is scatterbrain which is a goal
it's basically just a straight-up
yellowy goal it's like a champagne gold
shade you can use this as a highlight
this is actually the one shade I will
say is a little bit flaky and a little
bit dry and I would definitely suggest
spraying like fix+ on your brush when
using this one but other than that I
think it's a beautiful shade and you can
definitely make it work but this one I
did notice had a little bit of fallout
in it the next day it is a bomb diggity
oh my god I absolutely love this shade
this is like one of those baby pukey
shades that is like so pretty it's super
pretty feel super creamy super nice
the next shade is a cray cray which is a
really a pretty intense ass warm very
very very very warm almost like rusty
warm orangey Brown it's so so beautiful
I love it it's another matte
shade next we have the shade redonkulous
which is a golden a bronzy shade this is
Sarah here in a swatch this I would say
is much more of a coppery bronze it's
not like one of those brown tone bronze
or a rose gold bronze so it's gonna look
really really nice on hazel and blue
eyes next we have the shade at quirky
which is a beautiful shimmering purple
basically a straight up purple with some
black undertone it's not as bright as
the redonkulous is but it is super
beautiful and it looks again really
beautiful on hazel eyes I wore this
shade looks so stunning the next is the
shade cooky which is a really beautiful
maroon shade just a super just warm
maroon I love shades like this is like
my favorite kind of shades it's a matte
shade as well I absolutely love
it
oh so next we have this shade in one ear
which is a metallic cranberry shade so
this one is one of those shades were
like if you feel it it feels almost wet
it has a lot of oil in it so these kind
of really really amoliant shades I would
definitely suggest using an eye primer
that's more like oil absorbing and keeps
you guys do get oily on the lids do you
guys get oily on the lids and you don't
use one of those primers I think it will
like crease a little bit on you so I
would definitely suggest using a primer
that is much more silicone base like the
Mac 24-hour or the smashbox 24-hour one
which I love those are my
favorite ones and you will see no
problems with these whatsoever this is
just one of those shades that works
literally so creamy and smooth
and beautiful feeling like it feels wet
like it's just such a stunning
shade and it will look beautiful on the
eyes this is probably I'm gonna use on
the ice today because I'm like I can't I
need to use it like I
next we have this shade out the other
which of course is a second continuing
shade from in one year and help the
other of course it's like a brown purple
it's really kind of hard to explain and
it's not shiny and it's not matte it's
like a satin matte finish it's kinda
hard to describe actually it's stunning
though it's like literally like one of
those shades it's like a very intriguing
shade it's not a normal shade whatsoever
it's not a shade that you see in
palettes very often but it is stunning
on the eyes and I love it it
feels beautiful and of course last but
not least we have oddball which is the
black shade this is a really really
really nice black like I'm shocked at
how beautiful this buck is blacks are
very hard to do I'm I know because I'm
working on a black right now and it's so
 hard and it is one of those
shades where you're like what though
buck if you have it too loose and not
press hard enough too much comes out on
a brush and it will ruin a look it will
literally ruin your entire eyeshadow
look and that is devastating like I hate
that but if it's pressed down too hard
you don't really get enough color payoff
on a brush you have to find a happy
medium with a black and I feel like
Laura completely accomplished this with
her black it's so so nice it doesn't
feel as of course creamy or as smooth as
the other shades do because blacks never
really do it's a beautiful black and it
works very very nice it actually has a
little bit of like sparkle in it but the
sparkle does not translate when you put
it on your hand or on your eyes it just
comes off completely matte I don't know
how that works but that is that for all
the shades okay guys so I went in I
zoomed in now we're gonna do an eye look
using this palette
I'm so excited sorry I'm like such a
little geek right now I'm like I mean
look I just feel like such a proud
little best friend you know so I think
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do a really
fun cranberry I actually asked you guys
on snapchat and on Twitter what shadows
you wanted me to use the most with this
palette and literally about 80% of you
guys said the bottom four rows so
basically you guys said that you wanted
to see me using these four shades right
here because you saw a lot of people
using those cop shades and you guys
wanted to see me using indie shades down
here so I was thinking that I would use
the shade cooky in one here those are
the ones I asked I got asked the most to
do so I'm take the shade cooky on a of
course like a little fluffy blending
brush is a morphe e27
great just a fluffy blending brush for
the crease and we're going to go ahead
and put that into the crease my eyes are
primed by the way I want this look to
just be really intensely cranberry and
really
we're taking a very very light hand of
it so we can blend it just to be so like
intensely cranberry that I like this
shade of course you guys is blending
wonderfully it's such a beautiful matte
shade colors like this are trickier to
blend you know they're tricky to make
because it's really important to have a
shadow that has like a cranberry purple
undertone to blend really nicely and
they're hard to accomplish are not easy
to blend out by any means I think that
Laura really accomplished a beautiful
beautiful shade with Kuki for sure let
that blend it's seamless
Junie's ash okay so this is what we
should have so far after just blending
the bitch how it blends very very very
easily without me even using like a
transitioning shade that I always always
always use that's literally just going
in with cookie and not blending anything
out so that's sickening so now I
would take the shade in one ear which is
that beautiful maroon like cranberry
shade when I put that all over the
eyelid I would definitely suggest using
a finger with this kind of shade because
it is much more of an oily emollient
shade and I think that it picks up the
nicest with a finger of course a brush
will pick it up nicely as well but I
personally think that with this you want
to stick to a finger for sure so since
I'm layering a lot of shades on my eye
right now I see a little bit of fall out
on my cheeks which of course is normal
with really really hyper intensely
pigmented shades go ahead and take a
little bit more of that cookie shade and
blend that into the crease with that
beautiful in one ear shade as well do I
want to continue on with this like do I
want to add the purple quirky in the
outer corner quirky let's just see it
looks like a little bit on the outer
corner it just it gives it a little bit
of dimension it's not that noticeable
though look you don't you guys
definitely don't have to do this step
for sure or just give it a cute little
bit of dimension and definition because
it is of course still extremely shimmery
but it is darker doesn't give you that
little like like added depth which i
think is really really beautiful just
blend that together look who's gonna you
guys this look is gonna be so easy to
accomplish oh my gosh like a little
cranberry princess so guys now we're
gonna take the shade out the other on
the outer corner and this is going to of
course deepen up
everything just wing it out it just
take it there I'm gonna wing it out and
we're taking this on a more feet
36 this is a really good pencil brush I
want to take this out here I take that
same power 39 and blend out those edges
so it doesn't look crazy this I
just looks winged out and gnarly and
they flamed up in it we're gonna add
that depth and dimension I'm take a
little bit of oddball which is of course
the black and I'm going up but that
close to the last thing on this bucket
does not play do I see that you guys
just see that little extra mm not that
we're doing hey guys so now that we're
looking sickening and it's starting to
really come together and I'm really
seeing the vision I'm gonna take the
shade of quirky on the same a 36 pie
that on the lower lash line so we can
really combine all the elements at that
bottom 5 row and really smoke it out and
give us that really pretty purple pop
look at that like I feel like it's
really tying together okay guys so we
are now done with the dark colors we
have this sultry smoky intense blown out
 sickening a on our eyes
we're gonna go ahead and apply a little
bit of scatterbrain on a morphe m32 6
which is a great inner corner and a brow
bone highlighting shade a little bit of
a goal to give it a little bit of a pop
whoo you can see the difference of
course majorly now we're gonna do a
little bit on the brow bone as well
okay Maisie I'm gonna go finish the
other eye and apply some eyeliner off of
camera and I'll be right back actually
and apply some lashes off camera to
class takes forever be right back
and here we have it you guys this is the
final look using the Laura Lee Los
Angeles palette this is how it looks she
cute as though huh using new bounce
um Bombay lashes which are very similar
to Lily lashes Miami and that's it you
guys that's it for today's entire video
so what do we think of Laura Lee Los
Angeles is palette I think that it's a
complete win I think the Lord did an
absolutely amazing job as you guys know

literally be the perfect fall palette it
