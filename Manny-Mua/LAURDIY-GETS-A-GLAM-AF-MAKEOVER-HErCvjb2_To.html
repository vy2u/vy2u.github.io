really easy good neutral palette because
I'm gonna do neutrals in the eye and I'm
gonna do Stila
glam but not too crazy
oh you're gonna go anyway you're going
to die when he weaves behind your eyes
so we're just gonna take the neutrals
guys the neutral colors I were gonna put
them into the crease Buffy breath a very
fluffy brush to put down the first
transition shade I also have a
weird-shaped eye you don't I know I feel
like I really do why because it's a half
asian eye so it's like I have a crease
but it's not like a it's not like that
yeah no no exact what you mean actually
like I've hooded lids so I feel like as
well like no one has like the perfect
idea I mean there's people I do but
fuck himself I honestly just follow
everyone's like real creases like
reexamine this is like where your crease
lies right where like you can literally
feel it where your orbital bone is like
right underneath that your weapon your
orbital bone no makeup no one I got nein
anatomy so like right there you can see
as we're mapping it out with this like
transition nation you can see it's just
following that bone this is why I love
about doing your style of eye makeup
because I also feel like right here they
connect so nicely and like you can kind
of keep like with the shadow down here
as well you can keep it like flowing and
also makes you nose look a little bit
more snatch so I really love me a snack
no we love a snatch nose probably
