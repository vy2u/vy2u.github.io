so it takes video it's going to be a
review video I have been getting tons
and tons and tons of tweets and comments
from you guys asking to test out the LED
lashes the ones that like you put on and
they like glow in the dark or they move
into a weird movement or whatever so I
want Amazon I don't have everything
everything you know so I went I bought
these LED lashes it just has made in
China LED lashes as like 15 dollars so
that's what we're gonna be doing today
guys we're gonna be testing out the LED
lashes as always if you guys don't like
this video if you guys do not like me
please don't fucking watching you know
the joint yeah but if you guys that do
like this video please subscribe to my
channel if you're not already and if
you're new what's up a man um you a and
welcome to my channel thank you so much
for being here I really really
appreciate it
oh yeah it's gonna get into testing
these LED lashes a little bit so what do
we have here we have the V LED lashes
basically guys this is the most basic
aspect just says made in China has it's
a little like barcode on the back and
has this and I'm pretty sure there's no
instructions in here whatsoever
literally we have a strip a strip a
power source I mean basically this is
more of a self a self learning
experience so I'm not really sure
exactly what we're gonna do I'm excited
to try these out guys I'm really a
little shook but I think my glass glue
on this to make it sit to my eye you
guys have a basic bitch dude I don't do
another day shit we take the house of
lashes lash glue we're gonna take a
little tiny amount of laughs to on this
band I thought you liked I thought I had
like a sticky I totally thought wrong
weird so let it dry we're gonna let the
little LED lashes dry I really wonder if
this is gonna work oh it's sticking it
is sticking I feel like I'm a drag queen
and I'm like using tape to listen me a
lot my eyes okay guys so it feels
basically very very very very
uncomfortable okay guys so this is
really hard and I'm trying to figure out
a system oh my god okay the lashes are
on and I feel like a warning spectacles
I don't know it feels so uncomfortable
we're gonna go ahead and connect we can
connect these two back here a little bit
and the button is not working okay hold
the fuck on this is not working I'm a
flop I'm a fucking flow let's see if
this works one more time I just switch
the battery around the lash glue is
coming on then and I'm looking a little
fucking idiotic at this point I got real
life in there that's why I heard talking
Hausa lashes glue Lesha is not a joke so
ty came in Laura came in we all try to
get this fucking bullshit to work no
luck no luck we went to the fucking star
wing down a CB s full fucking beat with
my last being wonky we got some
batteries put it in still didn't work so
I'm a little fucking pass so guys I'm
gonna basically just say it right now
this is a complete flop it didn't even
work
it's completely broken on the inside I
don't know what it could have been we
literally got more batteries didn't work
I tried putting this shit in multiple
times didn't work I flipped the battery
inside out didn't work I don't know what
company this is this led lashes I made
in China I think okay so it says top van
LED flash eyelash liner for partying so
guys what I think about the video I
think this is a complete in total yeah I
don't know I think I want to buy another
pair just to see if it'll work because
this pair completely was dead like I'm
so pissed I really wanted to work so
badly like I really truly did and I'm a
little fucking annoyed right now
hit-or-miss complete fucking miss I
don't know what they've seen it could be
a hit for other people if it weren't for
me but the thing is I wanted to keep
this video going because this is what
really happened like this is my real
reaction so I bought one it didn't work
and I filmed the video and I didn't
upload it like that's kind of dishonest
to me like this is my real first
experience with it and it did not work
it completely is broken and we tried
getting different batteries it didn't
work so I'm like fuck it man I'm gonna
upload this video and say my experience
it sucks that he didn't work I don't
know how I would avoid it I would avoid
this fucking LED lash thing like the
plague Laura honestly I'm fucking
annoyed
as if you don't buy super shit every
fucking day Jamie I should've worn a
fucking gimmick sure that's how it feels
when you flop I had to do Ellis turn it
around I loved it
yeah you guys that's it for today's
video I'm sorry but it did not work I'm
more pissed than you I promise you guys
hey guys I'm Grayson night or day
wherever you guys are and I will catch
you guys in my next video bye you guys
