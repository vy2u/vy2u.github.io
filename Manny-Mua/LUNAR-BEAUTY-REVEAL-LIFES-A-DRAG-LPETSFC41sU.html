today is the day what's up how are you
guys doing I am so thrilled and excited
and nervous and literally every single
motion I could possibly think of right
now because I'm going to be revealing my
first product with lunar Beauty if you
guys are new what's up a man um you a
and I have a brand called lunar beauty
and it is something I've been working on
for the past two two years I've
been working on this for two years
working on different products and this
guy is my first one to launch and I'm so
excited but I really want to beat around
the bush too much I wanted to kind of
keep the intro short and sweet and
simple and just say thank you so much
for being here and being interested and
wanting to see what I'm gonna be coming
out with I know you guys are excited to
see what it is so I'm just gonna shut
the but as always if you guys don't
like this video if you guys don't like
me please don't watching the
drill with that but if you guys do like
this video please like subscribe to my
channel if you're not already and if you
knew what's up I'm an emu and welcome to
my channel thank you so much for being
here I cannot believe you here watching
this with me right now I'm super nervous
and I don't know how to react right now
and I'm super scared and excited and
there's so many emotions going on and
I'm gonna try not to cry and I took that
core as an X that should help me a
little bit not be too emotional about
this but it's like built-up tension
that's going on in my body right now
that's gonna be released I need to
breathe you know anyway let's go and get
right into what the product
okay guys so let's go and just talk
about it right away let's just go BAM
let's just talk about it Manning shut
the up what is my first product
what does lunar beauty coming out with
for the first thing ever as a brand
showing to the world what is a lunar
beauty for me is basically like the
essence of man yummy way but also
different at the same time my goal for
lunar beauty is coming out with products
that are not only high quality because
that's a given like I will not come out
with something that I don't think that
has a great quality I really will never
ever ever do that I wanted to have
products that you guys would be proud to
own and proud to show in public example
if you're putting on a lipstick I want
you guys to be proud of the packaging I
want you to be proud of where it's from
and that's what my whole inspiration for
my brand is I wanted to be out of this
world beautiful and so I hope that my
first product really reflects that and
reflects my thought process when it
comes to coming out with something so my
first product the big reveal okay so I'm
gonna show the the packaging first
because it's the box that it goes in
boom you guys my first product is called
Lysa drag and I know this name has been
leaked it gotten leaked a while goes
because people found my trademark people
saw and they're like oh my god like
life's a drag you old mice to drive but
it has to be something with life to drag
so that got leaked a little while ago
but it's all good it's not something
that I'm like about you know like
happens and you just move on so people
find my trademark and I'm like yeah I
found my trademark it is what it is but
hey she's here now and that's all the
matters so the packaging right here is a
rose gold highly foiled metallic finish
where almost looks like you're looking
into a mirror like that's kind of what I
wanted the life's a drag is in full gold
glitter as a little crown for a queen
basically by the way this is a color
palette I'll talk more about it later
this is the back of it it's the same
exact setup as the front we have gold
accents of it it has like a cute little
love note which I'll read later white
gold and pink that's what the color
story of the unicorn is the gold is so
 cool on Fiesta literally see it
but it's like the type of gold that like
reflex like intensely
it's like a glittering gold you think
it's stunning
I promise okay so I'm gonna open it now
okay ready are you ready oh me
bitch oh honey this is my palette this
is life so Jack right here these are my
eyes in drag it literally is my eye in
drag makeup lipstick Nick did I make it
for the cover of this I love you you
know I love you I'm gonna turn
the brightness down a little bit so you
can see what it looks like a little bit
easier except like the brightness kind
of folks a little bit I know it's dark
right now but you can see
a little bit easier so this is what the
paddle looks like as a holographic Sheen
over it as an on bright pink on the
sides life's a drag embossed here my
eyes and drag with these cute little
rhinestones on it like the rhinestones
are foiled as well like right here and
the back of it is this right here has a
holographic finish as well it's color
palette and boom so let's just open open
it I know you guys are curious
and you're like what the fuck's going on
I'm gonna go and open it and this is
what the inside of the palette looks
like this is first time ever showing it
on camera this is really till this it's
what the inside of the palette looks
like right here bitch oh my god so as
you can see the gold glare it's white
gold glitter and pink accents just like
the unit car and I want to all be very
very cohesive the mirror says be a queen
and we have 14 shades in here and it
comes with a dual ended brush as well
every single pal will be getting a brush
this is what the brush looks like right
here it is a packing brush and a blender
brush I can't be this is happening in
copy what is happening this is my
palette I'm just gonna talk about the
packaging real quick life's a drag
technically is a play on words life is a
drag you know like life's a drag I just
don't think it's cool and I put
be a queen on the mirror because it's
like drag queens Sierra I'm saying I
wanna talk about the colors and the
shades I must watch everything right now
really quickly but I wanted to talk
about why I did this palette first and
why I came out with life's a drag as my
first product for lunar beauty a lot of
you guys do know but a lot of you guys
don't know this is that I actually
started my career as man emu way in drag
my first experience with makeup ever was
in drag for Halloween I'd done drag a
couple times after that and I would have
never become an yummy way I've never had
followed the path that I want right now
if it wasn't for drag so I wanted to do
something that was really like paying
just an homage to the drag community
because it really is important to me
it's been important to me for the past I
don't know how long for years and years
and years and years I know a lot of
people probably thinking like man you're
not a drag queen while you're coming out
with a drag palette to me drag is not
only about female impersonation it's
about the freedom of expression when it
comes to makeup when it comes to
wardrobe when it comes to literally
anything you want to do it's basically
putting your best foot forward it's
about creating what you want to create
and not caring what other people think
and I feel like that's always been our
message since day one I know not a drag
queen but I love makeup and I'm so
excited to come out with something like
this because I feel like this is
something that would be fun for the
community you know when coming out with
a product or with a palette like
everything's been done at the end of the
day so now it's about focusing on the
messaging the packaging and the quality
of the products and how everything looks
that's what's really important to me
this is her right here so I'm gonna
the name's Justin I wanted to show you
guys what it is and I'm going to be
doing swatches as well all the shades
are inspired by drag or definitely in
the LGBTQ community so the first shade
the white shade is cake it's gonna be in
order it goes cake face sickening hunty
Beach campy pageant queen keke shady
trade mug legendary chi-chi snatch and
fishy really quickly a little more
information about the product itself
with lunar Beauty it's basically about
products that you guys are gonna be
proud to own I would never come out with
something that I wouldn't think is such
high-quality something that I did the
best I possibly could to create
I did the best that I physically could
as a human when creating this and I know
that wholeheartedly which is why I'm so
proud to talk about it this product is
cruelty free which I'm so excited about
announce that as well but I also wanted
to shoot my shot basically at creating
something that was vegan as well and
create a palette that had no carmine in
it which is basically a byproduct of red
beetles so many brands use it it's a
very very very commonly used thing but
when you use carmine you can't claim to
be vegan because it is a byproduct of an
animal so when you're doing a match
shade or any kind of shade that involves
some type of reds or Purple's or
Burgundy's anything like that you have
to use these red dyes you know red 40
things like that so due to the fact that
it is a red dye it's a pigment it is
possible for it to stain the eye area
the media is oh there is a warning on
the back of the palette I have
personally used them all and I have
turned out fine I do not have staining
on my eyes but if you are extremely
sensitive you could potentially have
sanding on your eyes Urban Decay has
their electric pallet MAC Cosmetics has
press pigments as well I legally have to
say those red dyes potentially could
stain your lids it doesn't happen to me
no not necessarily but could it happen
to someone that's really really really
really sensitive it could potentially so
basically I decided to make this
decision because I did not want to have
carmine in my products I really really
really wanted to give those bugs a shot
you know I really wanted to be as vegan
as possible but because of time
management wise I couldn't register this
product as vegan it could only be
cruelty-free so right now it's cruelty
free but technically it is begin because
there's no carmine in it as well anyway
that is the t about that so she you guys
are aware and you guys know what's going
on I use them I'm totally fine I've
never had any stain in with any of the
shadows before so it is what it is and
honestly I feel like you guys will be so
understanding because I really did not
want to use animal by-products in my
product I did the best that I could and
I am so proud of what we came up with
was just going again to the fun stuff
that's one swatch the
shade and see exactly what they are
trying they got my jacket by the way yes
I am wearing the palatal nice today of
course you I don't wearing this
for so long I'm so excited about the
price point because I did literally the
best that I possibly could with being
made in the United States for 14 shades
plus a dual ended brush I'm retelling
for 45 bucks
and honestly I did the best that I
 could not I'm proud of myself
because my makeup geek collaboration was
nine I shadows for $45 and this has 14
shades and a brush dual ended for $45 I
think you guys will really really really
appreciate that as well because the
quality is so good it's way more
expensive to be made in the USA than it
is to be made in like China or any other
places like that and the release date is
going to be on June 2nd at 11:00 a.m. so
literally like in a week from today it's
gonna be really so like oh my god and
for those you guys wondering it's going
to be on lunar Beauty calm I'll leave
all the information that linked it down
below of course where you can find out
everything like the release they launch
time everything like that will be linked
down below don't you worry about it
everything's gonna be linked down below
you guys just look at the description
and so you very very crystal clear also
I'm gonna be having different retailers
as well I'm gonna have two different
retailers when I starting off can't talk
about them yet because they're not
technically carrying my product right
when I launch is gonna be about two
weeks later for a different one and then
a month later for another one one in the
UK and one in the United States so let's
talk about the pad a little bit more we
have a layout here to me we have eight
neutral shades and six pops of color so
I wanted to be more on the neutral side
because I feel like that's just the more
wearable option so we have these were
here and I wanted it to be aesthetically
pleasing so for me I love like looking
at this palette and seeing that the
neutrals are on the side and I'm like
huh I just love knowing that these are
the neutrals and then going to the
bright and you're like okay cool I can
do a pop of color if I want to if I
don't want to I can stick with the
neutrals it's totally fine this comes
with 21 grams of product these are the
size of a mac eyeshadow so you're
getting a good full amount of product in
here 14 shades we have 12 mattes and two
metallics I'm just gonna be the lowered
love no real quick cuz they just let me
you guys I'm gonna read this this is
just what I wrote on the back of the
palette because I'm just gonna be that
bitch you know I dedicate this palette
to all my makeup lovers out there we are
all Queens my first experience in the
makeup world was in drag which is why
drag has been such an important
influence in my life and always will be
I've worked so hard to come up with a
beautiful mix of neutral and bright
colors that blend effortlessly and I
know you'll have fun creating sickening
looks
with it as much fun as I had creating it
so thank you all for the constant
support life's a drag wouldn't be here
without you guys and that's of course so
true like I can't even express it enough
how your guys's support is what
continues to help me do what I do into
to what I love so thank you guys again
so so so much in case you guys are
wondering why there's like this gold
accent around the mirror it's because
usually those little crowns the Crown's
on it I wanted to be inspired by a
Queen's crown it'll be a queen so I
wanted to be like the little rivets in a
crown so I feel like I really wanted to
go above and beyond a really think about
every aspect of this palette that's just
kind of what I did have this stunning
sickening ass-fucking we have cake face
so this is the first shade this is the
matte why I'm gonna swatch it with my
finger so we have a pure matte white
this is probably the best matte why I've
ever used in my entire life and I'm not
just saying that it's literally
incredible to have cake face right here
cake face boom cake face of course you
guys it's like having a lot of makeup on
you know the cakey face but in a cool
way so it's like cake face I have a
cakey face right now and I cakey face
necks to get the shakes sickening
without an e because I wanted just to be
sickening sickening not sickening
sickening
this one is a orange e match transition
shade they have sickening right here
boom the guys sickening are at their
next we have hunty which is my cool
toned brown and it's like I just feel
like we needed a cool tone brown in here
we just did that's it right there it's
going to swatch her
that's a cool tone Brown right now that
is hunty I'm gonna go in swatch all the
neutrals first and I'm gonna go and
swatch the brains after let's go and
swatch mug which is a deep chocolatey
Brown and mug basically means face and
like the drag community it's like beat
that mug the face is among oh
it's so good instant freaking good we
have trade next and trade in the gay
slash drag community means basically a
hot-ass man that you're trying to sleep
with that's the trade and this is a
beautiful warm like burgundy color
ooh bitch we're and last of the matte
neutrals we have shady which is it's
kind of just goes without saying shady
is being a shady bitch and it's
shady so in that shady is that matte
black as well so this is two layers of
shady right there I did two layers of
that one just want to be fully honest
under set my blacks I don't like them to
be too too pigmented because I feel like
black is actually really really really
hard to blend out when you apply too
much of it so I feel like for me I
wanted to have a black that was more of
a buildable
black that was intense but you can pick
up a little bit you're like oh my god
okay I'm not I didn't ruin my whole eye
look so that's why my black is when you
swatch it right away it's not as
pigmented and you're like oh it's not
that crazy on the eye that's kind of
like what people need for black if it's
too pigmented I'm like oh you're screwed
like your spy your fact sorry let's go
ahead move on to the next two neutrals
which are my exciting shades which I'm
so excited about these are beat and
legendary and these guys are foiled
reflect glitter fades which I'm so like
so exactly
sorry I'm like living my best line right
now so beat is a champagne pink oh my
god I like forget every time like how
stunning it is like I you just watched
right now and like it hurts me with how
nice it is and legendary is a gold like
they are so sick so we have B
right here oh my god oh my god you see
this do you see her and then we
have legendary right after oh my
goodness
and you guys you guys can't see it in
here but these have reflex and it's a
glitter particle and it's basically what
gives anything a glittery appearance so
you have tiny tiny micro reflex in it
and it makes it have such an intense
ass-fucking shine you guys will live why
my family me tell you guys about being
legendary so beat basically is saying
damn that bitches beat like that face is
beat and you guys know I say B all the
time basically it's kind of saying that
your makeup looks so good that your face
is just like beat into the ground
uh-huh she's beat to the ground and
legendary is just like bitch you are
legend you're legendary and you deserve
a shadow name and that's why the
gold is legendary so next let's go and
go into the brights we have six of the
bright side I was saying early we have
six bright colors six pops of color and
I really really really wanted to
incorporate pop of the color in this
palette because it just was such a fun
thing for me and I love incorporating
color into my looks all the time I'm so
obsessed with that I love doing like a
copper eye of course is I mean neutral
and beautiful but being able to
incorporate pops of color too is
something I'm always been in love with
let's go and go with first one which is
campy which is the yellow shade campy is
basically like a form of Jack that's
just kind of fun big loud obnoxious
can't be dragged it just very like
in-your-face and yellow to me is a very
in-your-face like oh my god she's their
kind of color so we have it can't be
right here which is the shade right here
literally one of the best yellows ever
used my
our life connect someone going with
pageant queen and pageant queen is
basically self-explanatory
it's literally like you're in a pageant
and you're the winner but pageant
you know it's a pageant queen so pageant
queen is a stunning gorgeous plum shade
Oh bitch
honey this is white that down yeah oh
yeah like I'm literally obsessed with
that verbal like I'm wearing them in the
flashing right now it's stunning it's
everything I live I'd be the diag I
everything so nice we have Kiki and Kiki
is a fun one to me because this is a
basically it's a mint it's a mint green
things like this that are more pastel
are not good in a swatch they're
definitely more of a transition shade
it's not the best for like packing on to
the lid or packing on like intensely I
would definitely it's more of a
transition type of moment but I'm gonna
show you guys in the swatch Kiki's
basically like when you're with your
girlfriends and you're hanging out
you're gossiping and chatting that's
kicking with you girls it's just a fun
Tiffany's blue shade so this is her
right here so this is Miss Kiki I'm
telling you guys it's more of a
transition shade it's definitely not one
of those shades here's layer two of it
with two layers it looks
sickening for sure but it's not only
still more of a transition shade for me
technically let me do another shade let
me just do another layer of the yellow -
two layers of the yellow boom two layers
of the mint bail next we have Chi Chi
and this is the bright hot pink and I'm
actually so excited to show you guys
this shade because it's literally
stunning like I could scream also Chi
Chi so Chi Chi means when to drag queens
have relations while in drag that's a
Chi Chi so this is Chi Chi right here it
is a hot neon pink
it's literally like sickening oh
my god I have nothing to say other than
other than oh my gosh like it's
everything next we have the shades
snatched which basically just goes
without saying bitch you're snatched you
look snatch and that is a red a deep
rich red just a rich rich just
well and last but not least we have the
shade fishy which is a blue and this one
actually has a little bit of a sheen to
it but I feel like with blue a royal
blue like this for example blue is also
another very very hard shade to blend
out and it's so easy to become muddy so
I feel like when you add a sheen to a
royal blue it actually gives a little
bit of a leeway when it comes to
blending so I'm sure you guys noticed
when you're blending a shadow that has
shimmer
in it it's so much easier to blend
that's why I added a little bit of a
sheen to fishy it's definitely a little
bit of a satin shade so fishy also means
pretty in the drag world so like if your
fishy that means you're like prettiest
 and it's like damn bitch you are
fishy you are gorgeous
you're officially pretty bitch so that's
what fishy means and that's fishy right
there as you can see there's a little
bit of a sheen to it this is the colors
without the brightness so this is what
they look like a little bit more true to
color this brush is everything I want
you to brush that's actually
sickening when you were digging into a
palette and you like see a brush and
you're like oh you know it's like
sometimes it's not that good and you're
like dude what's the point of even
having a brush I wanted a brush that
literally was like oh oh at this end I
have a tapered blender we could actually
like go into like the little crevices
and blend out you guys can see it's
tapered here and see it's tapered but it
fluffs out at the ends and then we have
a really really really dense packing
brush on the other side that's what I
want it I want it to be like
high-quality as hell that's what I
wanted to do I want good and I know
you guys won't get you too and that's it
you guys that is it for my life's a drag
color palettes this is my baby this is
my child this has been what I've been
focused on for so long and so
hard and I hope you guys understand that
I have really put my heart and soul into
this I really thought this out I wanted
to have a beautiful theme I want to have
a beautiful packaging and to me this is
so beautiful and I'm also so excited to
see what you guys think of it I'm not a
full headed person where I would say oh
my god this is perfect as far as I
didn't know wrong I can never do
anything better than this it's
perfection my brands gonna flourish you
guys I am so glad to hear you guys's
feedback I want to hear what you guys
think when you guys buy this product I
want to hear what you guys think what
you guys loved we guys didn't love about
the product itself you know what I mean
that's what I'm so excited about when
you've been working on something for so
long you need a different set of eyes in
there you know and luckily I have my mom
and my dad and they have the been the
best biggest supporters ever and my mom
works with me and my dad was to me and
this is actually a product of all three
of us it's not just me
it's also my parents who are
incredible the best parents I could ever
ask for you know when you're working on
something for so long you get into your
ways and you can get on this tunnel
vision and you think of it as being
something that's perfect and it's
something that you want you're so
excited about sometimes you need another
input you need other opinions about
something so I'm very very excited to
see what you guys have to say about this
and I hope that you guys are giving me
constructive criticism not just being an
asshole you know this is my child my
baby and of course I know people are
gonna be hate
I know people are gonna give me and
I know this isn't that but I hope you
guys do understand I have been working
very hard on this and I tried my best
and I am doing the best that I can with
what I have as my resources you know as
I said earlier this is all on me
is on me my mom and my dad and I poured
all my heart and soul into this and it's
just so crazy to think that this boy
from San Diego this little gay boy from
San Diego girl Mormon who had his
parents ask him to delay his Instagram
because they saw him in drag now have a
palette that's coming out that is
inspired by drag it's just I don't know
it's hard to explain you know it's
really really hard for me to kind of put
into words how I feel because I feel so
overwhelmed in a good way I hope you
guys love it and I hope that this is
something fun for you guys and something
unique and not just something just to
put out for the fact of making money
that's not what my goal is I really
wanted to have products that are just
great I'm so excited about influences
coming out with brands because I know
the influence just have your guys's back
it's not just a big corporation that is
literally just trying to feed products
down your throat that just trying to
make money we actually have your best
interest at heart and I really truly do
and I hope you guys know that when I'm
talking to you guys about this thank you
guys again like I said I'm gonna leave
all the information linked it down below
talking about it the launch date the
launch time everything will be linked it
down below in case anything changes
which I probably will not but thank you
guys for watching this video thank you
guys for being here with me I actually
filmed this look that will be going up
this week as well so my first tutorial
using this palette doing this I look on
my eyes right now because you can do so
much with this palette you can do so
 much thanks guys for watching
this video thank you guys for being here
with me think you guys were being along
this journey with me which has
been so wild and I think it's all been
leading up to something like this
because I've always wanted my own brand
