is what worked before the brow and
that's what I continued it as now we're
gonna prime the eyes and when I start on
the pie maker we're gonna take the tart
shape tape concealer we're going to put
that all over the I use I'm just gonna
prime the eyes with the concealer now
we're gonna start on the eye makeup so

neutral because you are going to the
premiere mm-hmm so we're gonna take the
morphe 35o two guys we're not gonna take
the crazy ones we should take the
neutrals down here your makeup is so
Queens if it's mine all these are you

these colors together I bring that to
the crease your crease is quite easy to
find deep sunken tired eyes that's about
it okay guys we're gonna take these guys
up here like these like three these guys
are out here we're gonna put that into
the crease with this fluffy brush I
don't know why whatever like I'm collide
with people like some type of weird
accent girl I know I love it like I love
how weird your your soul like a can
express you're so gentle how the like
whenever you had you make it done before
the gentle too might be the most ever

orange and blue or like the commentary'
and the complete whatever I'm saying
that with each other
we did an episode of the Magic School
Bus hey Lisa
yeah how she feeling feeling soul treat
you know now I'm gonna take a little bit
of the time to do that along the lash
line to do a winged liner how people go
to carpets or anything yeah like it can
get like fucked up real quick mm-hmm let
me just do like a smoky lash line okay
it's kind of like giving you definition
on the lashes mm-hmm without having to
do a full intense like liquid or cream
liner and everything mm-hmm but it don't
look like it makes it gives your eyes
like this really different like smoked
out really depth feel so now we take
black eyes take a little bit of the
black we're gonna build up on the brown
and a little bit even closer to the
lashes just talking about smoked out
like ooh other than this one yeah other
than this exact moment okay so much on
