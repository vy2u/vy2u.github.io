so today's video is going to be another
review video and I have seen this
floating around and I'm like yo I need a
fucking try this shit out because I've
seen so many people playing with it
I've now watched a single review on this
product yet because I'm too scared of
becoming biased and listening to like my
peers and things like that so I'm going
to be trying this out for the first time
right now hey Larry still have it in its
PR package and today it is the Mac
roller wheel liquid liner why can I not
say that there's a lot of evel's Mac
roller we a little go to the liner it's
literally like a little pizza cutter
that's one of the shape of this eyeliner
it looks like so I'm actually really
excited to try it out and see if I can
make it work the reason I make it look
like this today is because I'll just
kind of fucking around just playing with
some colors and things lying about I've
only got to play with color in a minute
so I feel like whenever I see a color
that just speaks to me like purple I use
purple all the time I always just kind
of want to fuck around and play with
that color so I do not feel this is it
literally just me in my kitchen like so
yeah it looks a little drag today but
fuck it why not
no but yeah you guys as always if you
guys don't this video if you guys do not
like me please don't fucking like you
know Lajoie with that but you guys that
do like this video please subscribe to
my channel if you're not already and if
you're new what's up a man you anyway
and welcome to my channel thank you so
much for being here I really appreciate
it be hey guys let's go ahead and get
into this Mac roller wheel liner review
I can't say it ashin it for I can't
so the Mack roller wheel liquid liner he
says it's available online and on August
17 2017 in stores at September 14
through 26 it's 21 bucks it's on the
website even though it said on the press
package that it was going away up on the
17th that's really odd but it's live
right now so if you guys want you can
definitely get it comes with one
milliliter aka point zero three u.s.
ounces there's four shades those black
does blue there's like are you really
pretty it Brown and then there's a shiny
black and you should also just be able
to wheel it on like a little fuckin
pizza cutter so we're gonna go ahead and
try it
having said I'm just gonna type in the
word zoomed in we are zoomed right on
children I have a little mirror now this
isn't this so fucking cool uh this was a
gift from a subscriber to me I think I'm
gonna try to make a mirror with my merch
guys I've been like in the process of
trying to make that happen we were
trying to find the vendor to do a mirror
it's a mirrors a lot harder than it
looks
trying to get a mirror to happen but
we're gonna try roll the wheel look
aligner there's a little ball a little
bit of time here you twist it off this
is the smallest thing I ever did see I
had no idea so little so tiny I thought
I was so much bigger I don't know why
okay let's try it
okay okay
well it tickles me okay
okay not terrible actually not terrible
okay got thicker got way thicker than I
was supposed to oh this is weird okay
we're gonna try to do a wing now the
wing is one of the most secure noise we
gonna okay let's see a little wing with
this little wheel huh it's too much it's
too much product huh okay hmm
hmm
okay so what I'm trying to like go
across like I normally do with like a
brush it doesn't wanna up fucking and
move with me bro I want to just go
straight in it doesn't like one another
thing there we go
okay so we got the one wing on I'm not
the biggest fan to be quite really real
I think this is actually really really
hard we're gonna quit while we're ahead
even though we're behind you guys see
that shit like see that right there Wow
oh that's fucking hard you guys the
thing is I pride myself on being able to
do a wing like I think it's one of the
things I can do in this industry cuz
usually I fuck up with a lot of things
but doing a wing I'm pretty okay yeah
fuck me it's rough and the actual
formula itself is really really really
dry like I can barely move my fucking
eyeball
the hardest part is doing this right
here and I get that the connection
between a wing and actual liner that is
so hard with this I don't know why it
does not want to connect yeah okay I
think I'm done I'm good I'm good
we have a fucking verdict okay I think
we're good okay you guys so what do we
think of the pizza cutter liner what do
we think I mean the wing is whatever
it's not like the worst thing I've ever
ever done but it's one of the worst
things I've ever done actually it's
definitely one of the worst you cannot
make a sharp edge with it it's not
something you can easily just kind of
like flick out and be sharp it like
blunts out how come it's all skinny on
this one on mine mm-hmm honestly I just
feel like it's a little bit too flimsy
the product itself the actual formula is
so dry like I feel like it's gonna flake
off my eyes any second like any weird
movie it's going to flake off like I
don't know it just feels really really
drawing on me it's very very very matte
uh I don't know guys I just think that's
for me this is more of a flop maybe I'm
just not skilled in the realm of a wheel
liner I'm sure you can make it work I
feel like it's not like terrible
terrible where you're like oh my god I'm
fucked for years I think they can
definitely make it work if you guys
really really try and practice practice
practice with this kind of winged liner
but for me personally it's just it's not
practical so I have to say for me this
is more of a Miss I would say just pass
up on this guys go with a regular felt
tip liner or a brush tip liner or a
brush like actual brush because I think
this is gonna be kind of hard to use
it's not the most user-friendly as I
said yeah you guys hope you guys enjoyed
today's that really you know oh you are
you like yeah I'm currently in the
process of pre filming right now because
I'm going to Bora Bora very soon so I'm
pre filming all these random asks for
views and just videos and things like
that and that is it you guys that's it
for today's entire video all in all I
think that this was a miss for me I will
probably literally never use this ever
again it's way too hard to use
um but yeah hope you guys enjoyed
today's video as always how great was
the night or day wherever you guys are I
will leave this link down below if you
guys are interested just in case but
yeah I will see you guys in my next
video I love you so much

fucking heart I don't know my dick and
