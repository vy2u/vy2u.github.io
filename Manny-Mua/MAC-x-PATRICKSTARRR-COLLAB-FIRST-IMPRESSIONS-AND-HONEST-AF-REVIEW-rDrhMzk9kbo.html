today's video is going to be a fun one
I'm so excited to be filming this this
is a review and demo and using the
entire brand new Patrick Starr ex Mac
collaboration they came out with an
entire collection I'll go more into it
after this part so recently a Mac and
Patrick Starr came out with this entire
collection during the holidays it's like
this really pretty white and silver
accented collection and I got it
recently and I really really really
wanted to review it and see how the
collection was I know there are a couple
products that are existing Mac items and
they're couple products that are new
that Patrick curated with Mac and so I
thought it would be really fun to review
this I have not reviewed a Mac
collection and so long this collection
is such a hyped thing because Patrick is
a social-media influencer and he's on
social media a lot and it's just cool to
see Mac and Trust
a social media influence with our entire
own collection and I believe there's
gonna be five collections to come
through the next year this is actually
their second influencer collaboration
because I had the question about Laura
Lee and Gabriel Zamora who collaborated
with Mac and they did a lipstick each
which I still have which I fucking love
both of them but this is way different
though because Patrick gets his own
entire collection and he's coming out
with different collections throughout
the entire next year truly from the
bottom of my heart I feel like Mac could
not have picked a better person than
Patrick took cub with them for Mac as a
lot of you guys know Patrick has his
Cinderella story up on his YouTube
channel and Mac was such a big influence
in his life I thought Patrick is who he
is today because of Mac and his
experiences at Mac and his motto is a
makeup is a one size fits all and Mac's
motto is all ages all races all sexes
and I just like to go hand in hand to me
this screams of makeup has no rules I'm
just very very very excited about this
collaboration so yeah I'm gonna stop
rambling on I'm gonna go ahead and start
on it this review I have no makeup on
because there is a powder in the
collection I really wanted to try out so
I'm gonna be putting on my base and then
putting on the powder to see what we
think of the powder before I start I

for being here I really appreciate it
yeah it's gonna get started on this
review of the entire collection from
Patrick Starr and MAC Cosmetics okay so
before we go ahead and dive in on the
product that's go ahead and talk about
what the products are and what actually
comes in the entire collection so this
is the pr package this is it right here
it's a very pretty
holographic very glittery and very glitz
very glam very P fresh for sure so this
is the collection here guys it comes
with two palettes a powder three glasses
three lipsticks and three lip liners I
love this silver fabric I think it's
beautiful and then we have a little
notes here from Patrick as well just
really really really exciting you guys
can go ahead and pause it and read that
if you guys would like I'm gonna be
swatching everything guys by the way I'm
not gonna like just do a look and like
that's it I'm gonna do all this watching
them do the whole fucking thing so the
pure package comes with this entire
pamphlet and I believe it's basically
information about the entire collection
and how and like what entails the
pricing things like that so just go and
talk about pricing really quick ly so
lipstick we have mama star which is a
reddish-brown satin finish Patrick Wow
deep yellow red matte we have a she
better work soft pink matte and those
are going to be 1750 u.s. and $21
Canadian so we have the three lipsticks
we have three lip classes that retail
for 17 dollars all named after the three
lipsticks lip pencils out of 1750 brick
mahogany and edge to edge to eyeshadow
quads we have the glamorous luck quad
and we have the gold getter quad and
those are $32 each 237 Canadian and then
we have the set powder which is a
colorless powder and that's $34 it's the
Patrick's powder and 38 Canadian and
also this thing down here it just says
available in North America December 14th
and all Mac locations and
internationally February 2018 and select
Mac locations fucking cool man and this
is cool so I'm looking at the Mac
website right now and I believe that
everything is priced at the same Mac
value so for example like the retro
matte lipsticks are 1750 and Patricks
lipstick - or 1750 same thing goes for
the lip liners I believe let's see 1750
just like the other ones are it's just
weird because when I worked at Mac I
worked at Mac a couple years back and I
remember everything being like $15 so
now there's 1715 that's crazy like how
the price has increased as the years
have gone over and I'm like holy shit
fucking pricing has gone up so now let's
just go ahead and dive in I'm gonna go
ahead to my base really quickly I'm just
gonna put on some foundation and some
concealer real quick and once we're
gonna start setting the makeup I will
come back and we will use setting powder
okay base is on we have not said
anything just yet so let's go ahead and
go in with the Patrick Starr
Patrick's powder set powder this is a
colorless powder it says on the thing
colorless ultrafine with a matte finish
powder here so Patrick is known for his
baking abilities and I mean that with
powder of course I just popped off the
lid so we can actually see the color of
the powder the color of the powder is a
pinky peach I believe it's gonna be
translucent of course but it the colour
there is a colour to it as like a soft
peachy undertone there's no way the
fucking camera's not mean I should have
come on it's like too bright so let's go
ahead and go in with a Beauty Blender
and let's see how she sets the under-eye
this looks like that's any one of those
power that's real brightening real
fucking brightening because it's not
pinky undertone okay so we're gonna put
this all over the face first impressions
is that it is a beautiful beautiful
powder it does give you a soft matte
finish it sets everything very nicely
I'm gonna just set the entire face with
it as you can see the areas that the
powder has right there it's completely
matte and you get like a shimmer around
the skin so I bet this is gonna be great
for people that a little bit more on the
oily side but it is so finely milled I
bet that would be really great for
people that are a little more on the dry
side as well it's nuts a Patrick collab
with Mac like that's crazy
I mean factor go fucking way back like
me that bitch goes so far back like shit
prehistoric days man like it's so cool
to see him doing his thing and excelling
and you know doing what he loves and
doing what he wants to do with his life
and its really awesome
okay the powder looks beautiful it's
fucking stunning and I'm just gonna go
ahead and press into the rest of the
powder so we're gonna put the powder
underneath the eyes and we're gonna have
it cook there I just want to see how
bright Ning like this powder can get us
so we're gonna put a good hearty a good
hearty amount on the under eye it's a
very very very finely milled powder guys
like it really is truly when they say
like finely milled Jesus anyway I'm
gonna go finish the rest of the face
really quickly and we'll come back with
the eyes and the lips okay so we have
the base completely on I decided just to
highlight my nose today and not Holly my
cheeks I don't know I just felt it
that's what I was feeling to day so now
we're gonna go ahead and go in with the
two eyeshadow quads this is what they
look like right here beautiful colors
very just like classic Mac
shades so we have the glam as fuck I
shot a quad which comes with Bruhl oh my
gawd saddle and embark and we have a
go-getter quad which comes with soft
brown amber lights Swiss chocolate and
I'm into it so both of these quads have
three shades that are already existing
from Mac and one new shade I believe
because I don't recognize oh my god and
I'm into it as mac eyeshadow shades so
I'm gonna go and just swatch the quad on
my hand really quickly I'm going to the
glam is fuc one so feelin the shadows
right now they just feel like a classic
eyeshadow they feel very like old-school
Mac so here we have the glam as fuck
quad right here these are the four
shades and this is the gold get a quad
right there so these are the two quads
so I first saw that Patrick was coming
out with the quads I thought was so fun
and I was so cool I'm like oh my god he
gets to come out with his own eye shadow
crime at first when I saw that they were
shades that were already part of Mac I
was kind of disappointed and I was like
fuck I wish she was able to create his
own quads until I saw the shades that he
used in the quads and I literally like
it like literally was like a fucking
flashback like that's or even like very
very that because of the shades he chose
for the quads like literally I would use
soft brown swiss chocolate brown script
embark and all that glitters that was
like my go-to Mac look and out of course
always use saddle and Brule and like
I'll just like oh my god like these are
my classic Mac shades so it's just like
really crazy to see like it really
brought me back to him like my old Mac
days I was like fuck dude like these are
the shades I would always wear too it's
just like the weirdest thing so I was
like you know what it's totally fine
maybe he didn't get to create all of the
shades but the shades that were chosen
for it are fucking incredible the shades
for me that are so amazing for Mac and I
feel like every Mac employee like uses
these shades because they're so fucking
good we're gonna go in take a little bit
of soft brown and Brule just mix them
together these are in different palettes
I'm just missing them two together to
make like a custom like little
transition shade I'm gonna put that into
the crease on a morphe 27 to see how
these work and how these blend it's
crazy because I feel like Mac for years
and years and years and years set the
industry standard for makeup in
cosmetics in general so it's really
really cool to see them do this
collaboration and I just like I'm going
back to my roots with Mac right now
using these products because Mac shadows
of course they work well
they're not bad shadows whatsoever like
they're not my favorite shadows anymore
I've found other shots from different
brands I like a little bit more but they
work so well and like there's there's no
denying that Mac has a great assortment
of color and they're good like they're
good products now I want to go in with
some Swiss chocolate holy fuck I'm not
used with chocolate and so LA on a
morphe r39
good good like packing like very Mac 217
style brush coming back to these days
man pack Swiss chocolate on the outer
corner I love this color arrangement I
just feel like it's so just so good like
it's so like just warm and pretty and
just like classic combination like I
really just love it so I'm gonna take
Swiss chocolate blend that out and wing
it out a little bit we're gonna do
something more Maki just like this is
very old-school Mac like bringing all
the darkness out here making that shit
winged out like it's so Mac so we have
this going on on the eyes everything's
blending very well everything's blending
very very nicely I'm gonna take a little
bit of embark on this morphe r41 it's a
good little pencil brush gonna put that
on the outer corner whew
yep we're going back to the Mac rooms
guys are getting back to the roots I
feel like I learned how to blend working
on Mac like that was like I mean I
already like had an affinity for makeup
when I first started but I feel like
when I was working on Mac I just like
really honed in on my skills of course
Sephora taught me what I needed to know
about a lot of stuff and of course I
learned the basics from makeup from
Sephora but when you're working at Mac
it's just different like you just learn
different skill sets you learn different
techniques and I feel like the reason I
am the way I am like the reason I do my
makeup a certain way is because of my
old-school Mac days too so I feel like
once you're a Mac person like - you
don't fucking leave you you know ooh ooh
that is so good embarq is one my
favorite Mac show something called time
it's so fucking good like it's scary
okay so this is we have so far now I
like it so now I'm gonna go on the lid
we're gonna take this shade oh my god
which is a frost it's the shade right
here feeling it it feels great I would
say honestly it's more like a taupe it's
like a pinky taupe shade and it's a
frosty finish a pinky
frost sheet and that's oh my god so
that's something I believe Patrick
period himself so we're gonna put that
one to the lid see it last like a really
pretty soft
frosty tone to it this is one of those
much more
terrible shades I wish was metallic and
crazy cuz that's my personal style but I
think that people would really really
really really like this because it's so
subdued and subtle but it's still a nice
lid cuz he's got really pretty pinky
topi reflection oh that's nice so you
can see oh my god on this eye nothing on
that I think see there's a little bit of
a sheen it just a little bit of color
right there I was gonna go in with the
gold one I think I've been doing gold a
lot now taking soft brown again on that
same more feet r41 I'm gonna go ahead
and blend that underneath the lash it
and the wing of that out to connect with
my outer corner out here we're basically
just gonna do the exact uni that we did
up here as we are doing down here
picking a little bit of a shade I'm into
it and I'm putting that right here close
to the outer corner taking a little bit
of an bark again just really deepening
the outer corner boom very magic okay
cool I'm gonna go and finish the other
eye off-camera and I put some liner and
lashes on and it'll be right back to
talk about the final version of what I
think of the palettes okay we are
officially done I have the I look on
this is what we have so far
that the Mac wing going where your
fucking goes out into a little cute tiny
point so now we have the eyes done we
use the pallets what do I think about
feet pallets I think they're actually
really great I truly love the colors
that were selected for each palette I
think there's such Cormack items and I'm
sure Patrick uses these all the time for
me it's like you know what if he isn't
able to puree all the shades himself at
least II was able to choose like the
best of the shades that he used from Mac
so I think that that's really really
awesome anyway so now we're gonna move
on to the lips I'm gonna use all the
lipsticks and lipglosses
and the lipliner so let's go in start
off with the lightest we have edge to
edge which is like a deeper darker pink
shade so I'm pretty sure that edge to
edge goes with she better work it cuz
it's like a pink and a pink I'm pretty
sure that's what it is this is part of
Mac's collection already in my car D has
edge to edge let me go in just a quick
lip line I'm not gonna talk too much
about the lip liners because this is
already from Mac and Mac is known to
have amazing lip liners for sure so we
have edge to edge and now I'm gonna put
on she better work which is a matte
lipstick this is like a nude pink feels
super comfortable very very very nice on
the lip and here we have she it's so
pretty it looks
so my
it's very pretty just like Barbie pink
shade to me it's gonna come a lot of
different skin tones and let's go ahead
and apply a little bit of the she better
work gloss on top of this and this is a
she but I'll work these are the lip
glasses not too sticky really loved one
on the lip so I'm very happy about that
so this is the first lip
I think it's stunning now to go ahead
and use a mahogany lip pencil with the
lipstick mama stone so that is the shade
that's named after his mother who is
like the sweetest woman so we have
mahogany lip pencil on I'm like I look
so funny back and now we have miss mama
star which is a satin finish so here we
have a mama star with mahogany and now
let's go put some gloss on show exactly
what it looks like with some cloth this
is very very very dark on me it's really
pretty it like really really really is
here we have it mama star lipstick and
lip gloss and with mahogany lip pencil
heart this is a heart color to describe
it's like a brown mob with the pink
undertone in it that's what that sheet
is right there so she had on earlier
took a very literally like a Barbie pink
and Patrick woo this guy right here
these are three shades okay now and last
but not least we have brick lip pencil
which is really pretty just like red now
we have Patrick woo - they ride with a
yellow undertone subtly this is supposed
to be similar to Ruby woo but this is a
lot more comfortable I can already tell
it's so much more comfortable then Ruby
Louise and here we have a patch of glue
and rock up at the gloss on because like
the red lipstick by itself looks so
pretty but I will put it on top over the
red lipstick I swatch so this is a warm
and I'll put it on the side too so you
can see what it looks like we have the
red gloss on top of Patrick woo we have
Patrick blue gloss by itself it's a very
pigmented and feels exactly the same as
other ones they're all the lip glasses I
believe so that is the entire collection
we're done at reviewing this entire
thing anyway so that is it for today's
entire video so what do we think of the
entire Patrick's rock collection
collaboration with MAC Cosmetics I think
that it was a great collaboration I
think it was so well thought out really
well done I can't wait to see his next
collaborations with Mac the next
collections to come and to follow this
one I feel like it's gonna be hard one
to top because these are all so well
done like it's very well thought out I
love the packaging I love
white and silver accents to everything
love the holographic feel to it
obviously I'm like holographic bitch so
I think honestly all in all the
collaboration is amazing I think it's
great the shades for me like the
lipsticks the one I'll wear the most is
this one
I think magic glue for me like matches
me the best I don't think that other to
match my skin tone as nicely as this one
does I feel like this one like a red I
really love it right on me but the
shades thing that's a personal
preference for me the quality was
amazing and that's what I'm here to tell
you guys like is that the quality was so
there so if you guys buy it and you guys
love the shades and you buy it and
you're like I'm gonna have the quality's
good you're gonna get amazing quality
because the quality of Mac is just good
like Mac has good ass shit so all in all
I loved it the powder I fucking loved I
think the way my skin looks is really
really pretty the quads
I loved all in all the collection was
mmm it was an a-plus for me for sure and
congratulations to Patrick and Mac again
and I'm sure it's gonna do amazingly and
I hope it kills it and I hope this it
just shows that like the beauty world
online medium filters it's such a strong
thing and we're stronger together the
whole beauty world wins
I'm so proud and I'm so grateful that
Patrick did this you know him being a
boy and makeup as well you know he's
opened a lot of doors for a lot of young
kids and for people in general you know
and so I just think that's really
awesome yeah that's it that's all I have
to say I think the collection is great I
think that you guys got any to hide him
from the collections you would love it I
really do think that from the bottom of
my heart
