name you a and welcome to my channel
thank you so much for being here I
really appreciate it yeah it's going to
get into this March favorites and
disappointments okay guys so first
things first we're gonna go into our
favourites I want to say one thing real
quick my first favorite is my hair a lot
of you guys know recently that I got
hair surgery and my hair's not grown in
all the way of course like it's been
only a couple months but you can see the
little hairs here they're just really
cute the turn to go in and it just it's
also have topics in my hair because it's
kind of patchy still stuff some topic
spray in my hair as well but it's like
actually starting to come in and this is
so crazy I'm so excited like this
it's like a life-changing thing for me
also insecure about my hair and my
hairline before and now I'm like
actually starting to have a hairline
that's like not like so far back like I
was having this is the first time I'm
filming and feeling comfortable without
wearing a hat so this is like a a pretty
big deal so the pretty big deal
to me right now so yeah my hair is
actually starting to come in finally and
I could not be more excited guys first
favorite so the first favorite of the
month I have to say is this bad bitch
right here this is the Anastacio and a
Nicole Guerrero glow kit I've actually
used every single color but mostly I use
kitty kat and forever lit those are the
ones I work on my skin tone the most I'm
actually wearing kitty kat and forever
lit on my cheeks right now I've been
wearing this cloak it guys so frequently
I just think it's absolutely beautiful
and honestly the colors are so bright so
vibrant so intense and so reflective and
you can apply a little bit to get a
small shine if you wanted to play a lot
more you can get really intense like
beaming from
outer space like from the these
things couldn't get that if you guys
wanted to it that's why I really like it
so much and honestly huge shout out to
Nicole Grail for creating this I love
Nicole Guerrero she's absolutely
bomb I still had a couple events
recently and it's just been so cool
because she's so down to earth so
laid-back so just cool and I
could easily see myself hanging out with
her like on the regular basis if she
lived in California so I just liked her
a lot and I just think it's so amazing
actually came out with such an amazing
product the colors are fantastic the
color scheme right here is fantastic so
congratulations again to Nicole and
Anastasia for creating an amazing
amazing palette the next product is a
bit of an expensive one yeah
so this is the lemare the soft liquid
foundation this foundation I've been
wearing every single time I've been
doing foundation other than today excite
film this this look I ready with a
purpose this is gonna be going up soon
cuz this foundation gives you a
beautiful like light weight to medium
coverage finish beautiful on the skin it
just gives you like this crazy glowy
like almost manic in like finish I don't
even understand it it's absolutely
beautiful
whenever I'm wearing it I'm like wow
dude like wow it is absolutely amazing
on my skin I get so many compliments
when I'm wearing this foundation as well
but I have to go in with a more fuller
coverage foundation underneath it just
to cover up my more rough patches my red
patches they're there they're
there so for example I'll take like the
hourglass advantage take and put it on
my cheeks on a little bit on my forehead
on my like t-zone and then I'll go in
with a soft fluid over it and it just
looks so freakin beautiful it soaks into
those like a hundred bucks
asaji books ah sorry but get a sample of
it at Nordstrom
I think snort some does samples I'm not
really sure I think they have lemare
there as well but if you guys can just
try a sample out have them pump like two
pubs into a foundation sample and try it
out it works on my skin and even though
I am more combo oily and still worked
really really nicely so I'm like
honestly that foundation it's amazing
but it's the next time a drugstore item
which actually really really really
really have been liking this is the
Milani make it last setting spray oh
 I look so good this is the prime
correct and set setting spray I just
really like this because I do notice a
major difference when it comes to
longevity of my foundation and keeping
my face
longer I was like whoa whoa when I first
sprayed this and I tried it on I did
notice that my face was set and didn't
get as oily as fast as usual like
setting sprays do on me and I was like
well Milani like this does have a lot of
alcohol in it though it's like the
second ingredient is alcohol but alcohol
makes things last on the skin that's
just what it is alcohol is a lasting
ingredient and liquid lipsticks alcohol
is a major ingredient because it has to
dry down and stay on your lips for long
periods of time usually so it's just one
of those things words like you have to
kind of give and take
yes alcohol is drying on the skin but
you want your makeup to last long it
needs to be in like a settings right and
you guys are looking for a good
drugstore setting spray that works
really nicely I would suggest the Milani
make it last setting spray because it's
 bomb next item I want to talk
about is this product by benefit this is
the hoola kwikki contour stick okay guys
it was actually a funny story behind
this product
I at first went the first time I tried
it I didn't like it I was like it just
wasn't like that great to me I was like
you know it's nice it's like a soft
lightweight amount of color I suppose
but it wasn't like that
powing I did like one little I do like a
couple dots like I usually do like I
would do a cream contour I did like one
two three one two three one two three
one two three and I blended it and it
blended away completely and I was like
and then I was telling my other friends
in the beauty industry like about it and
I'm like you guys have you guys tried
this like does it worked it worked
nicely on you guys and like yeah we love
it da da da and I was like well how are
you using it I get to use a little bit
more product than you would think so I'm
like okay so I tried and I D like a
swipe like a swipe swipe swipe swipe
swipe swipe and this color is so
beautiful it blended out beautifully as
I knew it would because it blended out
to nothing the first time I tried it and
I just left a beautiful amount of color
I'm gonna show you guys what the color
looks like right here
it's literally hoola in a cream form
hoola bronzer by benefit which is such a
popular bronzer and as you can see like
it blends so easily though it was like
it's like shockingly so I wouldn't say
this is a contour like oh don't say this
is more of a bronzing type of like
natural type thing I just like to use it
underneath my contour because it will
make it lasts so much longer if I have
like a darker base underneath and this
really does work so nicely and you guys
already know I love hoola I loved hoola
for as long as I can remember
since I've started using makeup I loved
hoola bronzer the the box of powder from
Ben
and when they came out that with the
quickie contour stick I was like please
let me love it didn't at first but now I
like I'm obsessed and I've used it so
many times like child she's got a couple
more favorites I promise just couple
more I wanted to talk about this litt
mask that I've used since I worked at
Sephora I've talked about it before I
think once but I use it so often that I
just forget that it's part of my routine
I'm like oh my god I should like talk
about this this is the bite agave lip
mask this has been out for so long like
four years I'll put this on at night
every single night and I wake up and I
saw some product on like it literally
leaves my lips feeling so supple so
moisturized
made in Canada good shits in Canada the
good shits in Canada the goods and kind
of a mmm you guys probably didn't see
that mom this is very very heavy by the
way like this is not a soft like
chapstick this is like a heavy ass like
lip mask it's very viscous it's like
very as you can see like it's very very
intense it's a full like mask
treatment I won't really wear this
during the day because it's so heavy but
if you guys want something that's really
hydrating and will actually work and
really hydrate your lips and night I
mean you wake up with your lips feeling
so plump and moist
check out the agave lip mask by bite you
will not regret it so this is actually
like an oldie but goodie and actually
it's a newbie to me because I never used
this before this last last month and a
half and everyone talked about all the
time but I never used it but I loved it
this is Mac painterly paint-pot and I'm
really going to talk about it because
it's like mani really everyone knows
about Mac painterly paint-pot
it's such an amazing amazing eye base
this one is great for using on glitter
this is not really a silicon eye primer
this is like a base just to adhere your
makeup on a little bit longer and it's
great for glitter especially the Stila
glitters that I wear all the time like
to steal a magnificent metal glitter I
wear those all the time and this is the
only primer that really really keeps it
on and without flaking off if I'm using
my silicone one it's so flaky and it
comes off because like I don't know I
guess like the silicone and the glitter
 does not mingle well so I'm
like okay so I started using Mac
painterly Paint Pot at honestly I love
it it's so easy to use I just did my
finger and just Pat it all over my lid
and it's cake I never used this when I
worked at Mac I only ever use concealer
to prime so now that I'm using it I'm
like I should've used it more
and last but not least is actually the
lipstick I'm wearing right now this is
my number one lipstick right now like
you guys have no idea this is the Tarte
lipstick in the shade beachbum this like
the new line of lipsticks that they came
out with this is like a very pretty
satin finish lipstick it's very creamy
but so pigmented it's not like one of
those creamy ones that are like kind of
pigmented this is like pigmented
like super super super pigmented very
hydrating on the lips and it lasts a
good amount of time as well I just think
Tarte did a really great job with these
lipsticks in general I forgot what the
line is called I'll leave a link down
below it's like there I don't mean it's
like their oceanic or aquatic or
something in fact is though it's like
marble to blue it's look like the ocean
beach babe is so so beautiful on the
lips and if you guys can check this out
like this has been my go-to color and
you guys know I love colors like this
but this one I like the way it feels on
the lips it's so hydrating so full
coverage I'm like my grandpa and now for
the monthly disappointments mmm they
happen again so the first disappointment
I have for the month of March is this
from Too Faced I'm sure you guys were
guessing that this is going to be in
here
this is the Lovelight prismatic
highlighter in the shade you light of my
life honestly I don't like any of the
three but this is just the gold once I
grab that it's the closest to me I'll
disappoint it in these is because they
weren't as pigmented as I wanted them to
be it took me about four to five layers
to get to the opacity that I wanted them
to be
they swatch nicely I think they swatch
very pretty and I'm like oh my god they
look so nice on the skin and they look
pretty but on the face like they don't
react the same way and I'm like I don't
understand this like why is it that they
are not blinding and pretty on the face
but on the hand or on a swatch on a
finger they look great I'm like I'm it's
just not registering and they're I think
30 bucks so it's like for the price it's
not worth the editing the packaging is
fantastic and I think the press inside
of it is so cute there's things about it
that I think are amazing and I'm like oh
my god this is the cutest packaging ever
but for the price like I was just really
disappointed with the amount of
pigmentation again from these and the
amount of glow you get from them you
have to really really really really
build like but you have to build on them
and I don't want to build but I am Bob
the Builder I don't want to build after
the Nexxus appointment this is from the
Estee edit this is the flu
metal I shadow in the shade don't be
afraid girl afraid my friend actually
told me about this one I don't want to
call her out because I wanna be shady
bitch but she told me about this shadow
and she was like dude this is so
terrible and I'm like really tried it
out and I was like I don't realize the
gag was real the reason why I don't like
it is because of how sheer and just
terrible they are like looking at it
like in the in the actual tube I'm like
oh my god this is a beautiful color this
is great at that was just a really
pretty purple glittery shade it's
actually black and has a purple glitter
in it the gag is real when it completely
cheers to nothing maybe it's just
formulated weird but if you move the one
too much it will literally break apart
everything like I feel like the one way
to make this work it's like Pat it on
your lid and do different things to try
to make it work but it's honestly not
worth it it's not worth this I look at
look at this like this slick set this is
just a swatch
you guys I've had any luck with them let
me know in the comments bar below and
any luck with this I like it when you
guys tell me that product that I didn't
like worked for you and why it did or
how it did um so if you guys liked
either of these products let me know in
the comments bar below and maybe I'm
just using the wrong hey guys that's it
