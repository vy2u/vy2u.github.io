gonna get into this March favorites
video
start with some skin care items first I
have a bunch of skin care items that
I've been loving in March like I feel
like March was a very good skin care
month for me and I feel like my skin has
been has been happier with me it's been
better it's been good so I'm gonna go
and get into the Fae B's the first thing
I wanna talk about is the Kiehl's
midnight recovery eye cream you guys so
kathleenlights here on YouTube she
recommended this eye cream and I just
forgot about it and like I remember
thinking like damn I wanted to get that
because she said I was really good for
darkness underneath the eyes and I was
passing my Neiman Marcus recently and I
walked past keels I'm like wait do they
do they have that midnight recovery so I
went in and I grabbed it and honestly
like what Kathleen said about it
diminishing darkness underneath the eyes
and things like that it really does
truly does help it's crazy like
I've noticed I've only been using it for
a month and I already have noticed that
my the darkness underneath my eyes have
started to diminish but I use it every
single night and I truly do feel like
it's making the darkness underneath my
eyes like go away it's crazy
huge shout out to Kathleen for
recommending this I really do love it
and the next product a skin care product
that again Kathleen lights or suggest it
to me and clean you up you know your
shake or you know your
this is the drunk elephant TLC Framm
boost glycolic night serum wow that is a
 mouthful it's a glycolic night
serum that's what this is so this is a
serum that I use every single night and
I have noticed a significant change in
my skin every single day I've been
waking up I feel like my skin is looking
a little bit better and better and
better it refines and regenerates the
skin underneath the skin's surface
so like the top cells they're dead like
they're done they're dead they're gross
so when the top layers is flaking off
and coming off the the layers underneath
the skin are pushing forward they're
better and they are not as dry and as
flaky and as wrinkly it is a refreshing
hydrating gel that resurfaces dull
congested skin by gently lifting dead
skin cells away I have wrinkles on the
side of my face right here like i have
smile lines wrinkles and i feel like
this product has been helping my smiling
wrinkles it's like look it's crazy to
hear but like I do feel like I've been
having less crackage in the smile lines
and that is really intense for me I have
a crazy
marionette line so I'd really do think
that this drunk elephant night serum has
been what's helping my skin out
like tremendously it's so expensive oh
my god when Kathleen told me how much it
was I was like what if something works
for me and I feel like it actually is
making a difference I don't care what it
is I'm gonna
the money on it because I want to look
sickening the last skin care item I've
been living for in this month is this
bitch the Clinique Moisture Surge this
was actually recommended to me by
Patrick when you would wake up the next
day his skin would feel really really
replenished and very very hydrated and I
was like like that's like something I
really I love feeling like my skin is
very plump and hydrated the next day
after I do my skincare so I tried this
out and I really do see a noticeable
difference when I use this and when I
don't like if I do it this one night I
wake up the next day and my skin does
feel refreshed in the feels plump and it
feels hydrated I use like the glycolic
night serum and then I use this on top
of it after that one dries down and kind
of sinks into my skin a little bit more
and I noticed that my skin has been
changing in a good way so I really do
appreciate these two products like
tremendously actually all three of these
thank you March for giving me these
products I love them go skin care this
is the Korres lip butter I just saw
online and I was kind of going through
like the lip products and I saw this
little kress lip butter and I'm like lip
butter sounds good and so I
ended up buying this and I chose the
shade guava or like the guava kind and
one is most amazing like this is
what it looks like it's like a little
pot and I like already dug my little
nasty grubby ass hands in there because
I've been into it what I really
like about this lip butter is that I do
feel like it really does hydrate my lips
intensely it's not like just like a
little like chapstick where I'm like
toss on chapstick can go and it's like
reapply like a lot of times this I
noticed I do not reapply nearly as much
as a chapstick this really does make my
lips feel very hydrated but we probably
have with this is that the guava shade
which is like the clear shade is not
actually clear it gives you like a white
film over the lip it makes it look like
it's bodily fluid that shall not
be named but it really does work
tremendously they have different kind of
colors and different flavors you guys
all want to have like that white cast on
the lips
you can delete ryoute like the
pomegranate one and there's like another
one that's really really nice but I do
love this Korres just slays my
entire life I love it the Greek yogurt
line is one my favorite lines from
skincare of all time so the karez lip
butter in guava I live for okay so I
want talk about a palette this month
I've been la thing oh so this is the Too
Faced sweet peach palette this is what
it looks like how freaking adorable is
this little palette it smells like
peaches
it'll litter
smells like pee songs I know this just
launched this month and it's been like a
really really hot item I can see why
it's really like the colors there's 18
colors in here that is so amazing like I
huh I love it I love it and I think the
clothes are absolutely beautiful it's
just a great neutral palette it's not
too intense it's not like bold words
like oh my god I can't wear this every
day this is very much a where everyday
kind of palette this palette is actually
that palette I'm wearing on my eyes
today other than obviously the wine red
liner is not this palette but the
shadows I'm wearing are this palette and
I think it's absolutely amazing I think
two faces beautiful eyeshadows I love
the chocolate bar that's like one of my
favorite palettes of all time from Too
Faced and it reminds me of that has like
that beautiful blend ability that mats
are very smooth
they're very creamy they blend very very
nicely and they're all very pigmented so
I really do appreciate that and I think
to face those beautiful beautiful
products so if you guys are interested
in getting a nice little palette that's
a nice everyday palette that smells
amazing that works very very well
check out the Too Faced sweet peach
palette next item I want to talk about
is this gorgeousness honey so this is
the house of lashes lash storybook you
guys can't look at it's mine basically
this is a lash holder like for when you
travel I you guys know me you guys know
me we connect you guys follow me on
snapchat hopefully you do if you don't
many anyway that's my snapchat shameless
plug that was so fast house lost my
breath I was fainted these are all
blushes I popped in like what I travel
with so the top three right here Bella
Bella Bella Serengeti Serengeti Russian
back from all-new bounce um I'm wearing
Serengeti I'm wearing the pair that sits
right here on my eyes right now and then
I have two at House of lashes eye
contacts and these two are from violet
Voss and it comes with a little holder
from lash glue I don't know I just think
that if you travel I would really
suggest doing the house of lashes lash
store I think it's only like 14 bucks I
really do think that this is really
really really practical and I absolutely
love it I think that you guys should
definitely check it out if you travel a
lot if you were a lot of lashes get it
let's talk about some brushes now let's
talk about some Russians okay I just I
just a lot of brushes in this world and
so I try out different brushes every
single month just to see like how I like
them and if I find some that I love
awesome if I don't then my life
I'll just go back to my normal ones but
you want talked about these really
quickly because I have been loving them
for the month of March if they're uh
they're amazing this is the morphe m/45
8 which is a very
small baby contour brush can you see
this how small it is but I don't use
this for contouring I actually use this
for powder application I have to cook
underneath my contour to give me more of
a sharp line and this brush has really
made it so freakin easy I'll dip into a
powder literally I'll just get the brush
drag like carves out a nice line it's
very very sharp it's defined it's small
and it's dense so it's gonna pick up a
lot of product and deposit a lot of
product as well also I've been doing
nose contouring recently a lot more than
I usually do so what I like to do is get
the powder again cook the sides of my
nose and on the tip of it and I've just
noticed that it really does make a huge
difference when you have a brush like
this rather than using like a powder
puff cooking in the kitchen cooking in
your face baking the face baking cookies
or whatever it is I just think that you
need this brush in your life awesome
where's your brush you guys
killed it more people love you in the
zone of contouring I want to talk about
this brush really quickly I just
discovered this one this month and I
it's been going to me it's in
good this is the morphe 50 so as you can
see like the ferrule is pinched but kind
of like becomes fluffy so it's like
really pinched here and then kind of
tapers out do you see that this has
become like my new contour brush my new
go-to for contouring it picks up
products so nicely it's a synthetic
bristle so it picks up very nicely and
it blends so freakin well it blends so
well because when you pick it up and you
kind of go in because it's fluffier it's
gonna blend over and st but because it's
tapered it's in the deposit that contour
right where you want it so it's not like
everywhere it's not crazy I just found
that this brush has really been
revamping my life the bristles are flat
on the side right here I can pick up
product kind of contour the temples a
little bit they launched this when they
launched the new elite collection
brushes but I never used it I've even
know I had it and I was like searching
through my brushes and I was like mmm I
saw this one I'm like this that's
promising AF and I've been using it and
it is it's bomb so if you guys
want to use a brush that's really really
great for contouring that blends out
your contour as well as deposit a really
nice amount check out this brush the
morphe 50 it's freaking amazing like
dude get this bitch I just want to bring
this up really quickly up and use them
yet but I just wanted to show you guys
so this is a new morphe kit that they
just came out with it's a cute little
like silver bag with a couple brushes in
it I get tons tons of questions of what
morphe kits are my favorite to like use
of which other kids are the best
you guys actually don't have a single
okay I've never used them I've only ever
used individuals so I don't really know
what are the gonna be the best kids for
you guys but I got sent this kit
recently and I truly think that this is
gonna be one of the best kits that they
have because they are the gun metal
brushes these are the gun metal line so
it comes with it comes with a buffing
face brush amazing like a blush contour
brush amazing a highlighting slash
underneath the eye brush amazing and
there comes with four little high
brushes of packing two blending and a
little eyeliner one it covers everything
and covers everything you need for the
entire face and I just would definitely
recommend this little kit if you guys
want a kit from morphe rather than
getting only individuals I suggest
getting individuals that's my style I
love mixing and matching brushes to make
my own kind of kit but not everyone does
that so if you guys want to get a kit
check out this one hello jobs our last
couple products we're talking to lippies
so first product I'll talk about is this
lipstick by bite it is called honeycomb
this color is so sick nasty it's
stupid it is the most beautiful baiji
nude color let me just watch it you guys
look at that do you see that usually I'm
not really into beige nudes like
whatsoever but for some reason this one
has been like killing it do like this
I've been wearing this very frequently
when I went to New York with bite I was
wearing this literally every single time
we went out every time someone saw me
it's like what are you wearing on my
honeycomb cuz I'm obsessed
also I wanted to bring up by really
quickly - because it's another favorite
of mine editing is really cool in New
York they have a bite lip lab I know I
did they did this you can literally go
in and custom create your own lipstick
which i think is just so freaking cool a
brand to do buy it like you
guys are smart like you're freaking
smart
it's literally like this so think of it
as like a build-a-bear but for a
lipstick I think it's like $30 per
lipstick which really is not that bad to
custom create your own Aguilar you're
like there cuz I'm creating your own
lips like they're like mixing it for you
you tell them I get I want alright I
want more beige I want more nude they
will literally do it so I think that's
really freaking amazing
it sucks cuz like New York is the only
place that has it but I do believe that
they're like trying to go out and do
more and like invest in different areas
to do more lip labs so I really hope
they do that because that would be so
freaking amazing and if you live in New
York dude do it go out make your own
lipstick it's such a cool process it
rising like collabing I felt like I was
doing a collab and I was like I've done
this before this is really cool if you
guys never stayed wanted to do that
custom create your own lipstick your own
finish your own bullet you can literally
do that at the bite
lab Soho definite SAR just doing that
also one more thing from bite because
it's already here I've also been mixing
honey gloss with honeycomb these are the
two I have been wearing it's what's on
the lips right now actually it's like
this lipstick with this gloss on top
I think this lip looks sickening
I just found all this like random who
fell from them so like I kind of want
share with you guys by use actually be
called bite me that's like what it was
called because like the ingredients are
so edible like they're so organic that
you can eat them and it wouldn't be bad
for you so that's kind of why bite is
called what it is is because the
products that they make are so organic
they're so good for you the quality is
so high that if you ate it it wouldn't
be bad for you so that's kind of why
it's called bite which I thought was
really is just a cool random piece of
information I wanted to share along with
you guys because I think that's really
badass and that's it for the March
