today's video is going to be my may
favorites of 2015 you guys know tickets
videos are my favorite to film they're
not my favorite favorite but they're one
of my favorites the foam because I can
literally just sit back talk to you guys
and I love just doing that I love to
sitting back and talk to you guys it's
just me sitting down with my friends and
talking about products I've been loving
for the past month and I love the kind
of reaction I get from you guys because
you guys always send me photos of you
guys going out and buying the products I
talked about which makes me so happy
like you guys have no idea like that
makes me so happy because I feel like
you guys are taking like my
considerations and putting them into
your own life and you guys love it I
know of course that products that I love
you guys aren't always gonna love but it
means a lot to me when you guys go out
and try something out because I
recommended it so that just means a lot
I don't know I'm just kind of weird
about that like I just think it means
like I don't know I feel like it makes
us closer you guys are like trusting me
in my opinion and I'm just like yeah you
guys do you love it too so it just makes
me really happy about it I don't know
I'm really weird about it
if you guys like favorites to do so if
you guys don't like me don't
watch the video because I don't want to
read your guys's negative ass comments
on my video look at that I can go real
like to like real quick so don't even
try it me cuz I can oh such a queen if
you guys do like this kind of videos
please like it and please subscribe to
my channel the other than that okay you
guys to the favorites because obviously
favorites videos are always so long as
done for me I I have a lot of favorites
all the time so always long I just get
into it right now okay let see this may
start because you guys know I have a lot
of favorites all the time and this month
is not an exception okay so the first
one is going to be the fresh sugar lip
treatment this one it's all inside
Sephora it is the most amazing lip
treatment I use this every single night
it is so hydrating so soothing and so
like smoothing I don't even how to
explain it I use it at my time before I
go to bed I put it on sleep and I wake
up and my lips feel more plump and they
feel more succulent you know they just
feel like they just feel good it is a
lip treatment so it's it's not like a
lip balm you wouldn't use this like you
would use a lip balm you use it a couple
like twice a day or like I mean however
in times you want to use it I
don't care you don't use it very much um
a little bit goes a long way if I feel
like I have any kind of joining this to
my lips I put this on and right away I
can feel it's soothing you guys should
just go to support and try it out like
just at least like swatch on your hand
or like clean it
I you see you this all the time when I
was at Sephora that's why you mean you
about this I never really knew about it
but like beforehand and I forgot about
it after I left Sephora so I remembered
like when I walked into somewhere
recently I saw this and I was like I
don't even buy that but like low-key
this bitch is expensive this is like
twenty-two bucks I almost like fell over
and had anaphylactic shock after
buying this thing because those twenty
two dollars I was like really a live
ball for twenty two but it's not only a
bomb it is a sugar treatment made with
real sugar real humectants it is very
hydrating and I think it is so good and
it's so worth the money honestly it
really is they have other ones they're
like different colors but I like the
original of the most because it feels
the best on the skin okay next one's the
new morphe elite brushes I've been
getting so many requests to do a new
updated video under my new favorite
morphe brushes that they've been
launching so I grabbed a couple of elite
brushes for this month because I'm not
gonna be creating a video on it
specifically because the elite
collection is a limited edition
collection it is not gonna be there
forever so I felt bad that was like what
if I make this video it sells out and
then like three months later someone
watches my video again and it's like
what the they're not even there
anymore
it's a limited edition lunch so I wanted
to talk about a couple of them really
quickly in my favorites video because
these are like my writer dies right now
so let's talk about them because I only
grabbed a couple because they are more
of an expensive brush they are way way
high quality and they are more expensive
the cool thing about morphe is that they
have a price point for every single
person that needs to shop they're like
okay if you don't have a big budget and
you need to buy a brush for two bucks
they have that quality isn't gonna be as
good but they do have it these ones are
like the highest and of morphe that they
have so they aren't like slightly more
expensive that just comes with the
territory when you have a nice brush
it's gonna be more expensive because
obviously there are nicer quality you
know okay so I'm not going to talk about
the faced ones first the two ones that
I've been obsessing with for the face
ones they are the e2 and the e3 to eat
too I use for bronzer on Easter powder
it is fantastic because it's just like
this flat paddle it's a synthetic hair
all of the brushes are synthetic hairs
you don't Harbor bacterias easily as a
natural hair would they don't soak up as
much product as a natural hair would as
well it's just great because it's so
friggin soft like I just want to play
with it like it's so soft that's one
thing
I use it to apply bronzer I use it to
kind of blend out my contour as well
because it is so soft it is great at
blending and it's great picking a
product it is amazing the e2 is to die
for amazing same with the e3 the e3 I
use for blush specifically because it is
that beautiful like very tapered perfect
size for a blush I'm not gonna talk
about each brush like in major detail
because it would be forever as long but
they are amazing you should really try
to get them so that I once I grab for
e36 is a small baby pencil brush this is
this one of the softest pencil brushes
I've ever felt ever my biggest problem
with pencil brushes is that they a lot
of them are not soft and they hurt when
I'm blending and I'm like man am I
trying to blend out my bottom lash line
and it's like hurting literally hurting
to like blend out my lash line so I
really appreciate a soft pencil brush
and this one is extremely soft this
one's amazing next one is the e 27 I've
used this in a video already this
reminds me of a sigma e40 or Mac 224 it
is that perfect fluffy blending brush it
is so good it completely reminds me of
the e-40 in the 224 it is so good at
blending it blends up like a dream I
don't even know how to explain it it
just blends out so beautifully a 27 to
die fall to eat 13 so this one is a
smaller version of that e 27 but it's
more tapered as you can see it's a lot
smaller it reminds me and again I come
back to 17 because it is a more smaller
fluffy brush I use this one today and I
use the e 27 today use these together
this one's great at picking up product
in depositing product like if you want
to do it a nice to blend it I but you
don't want to pick up too much it's
great because it is a blending brush as
well as a packing brush so it is amazing
and the last but not least is the e 14
which is a flat shader brush muesli can
you see this are you just for my
brow bone highlight and I use this for
my lid colors it's great because it is
very dense but it's not too dense like
as you guys can see it it picks up
product so nicely deposits it's so
nicely it is super super super good the
e 14 obviously type down every single
brush that used in this video down below
also of course I am a morphe affiliate I
do make a commission if you guys use the
code mani MUA in all caps the check out
you guys get 10% off and I earned a
small commission from that and I just
like to tell you guys that I've been
affiliate with brands because I just I
feel better and because II feel honest
and I just I like it like tip for me
personally I like to disclose that
information if you have to or not
sit in the affiliate think I understand

at the same time so it's like a win-win
I think you know and I just wanna also
say thank you to everyone that's ever

make into my channel so I really hope
that you guys can see that but thank you
guys forever using the codes for
anything it makes me makes me very happy
and I really appreciate it
yeah that was a long a long segment
because the Murphy ones are just really
good next favorite is the combination a
foundation that I've been wearing
constantly it is the NARS all day
luminous with the Loreal Pro matte
available I call this my event
foundation whenever I'm going to an
event whenever I'm doing some type of
like IMATS or like anything like that
like Fame Expo or anything this is the
combination I'm wearing Loreal Pro matte
in the center like right here only like
right in the center because I get the
most or leave there and then I'll mix
the rest with the laurio and the NARS
all day luminous and put it all over the
face it gives me beautiful coverage it's
like a satin finish looks like skin but
it's just like a better version of your
skin I can't even explain it I really
can
it is so freakishly beautiful and I am
obsessed with this combination and this
is my freaking drugstore foundation like
it's but it doesn't feel like that
this is like this is high-end
 swear it's so good it's like only
13 bucks and the NARS the North is a
little bit more expensive but I do think
that the combination together is so
beautiful I got a couple tweets the
other day and they're like oh my god man
uses the NARS and the l'oreal together I
use the law Roman ours together and I'm
like is it not amazing and you guys said
it was and I knew you wouldn't like you
- it's seriously the most beautiful
combination I'm sad I'm just the next
one obviously if you guys are are on
social media frequently you guys will
know that the Jorah cosmetics just
released their newest highlighters their
newest products I'm so stoked about
these I've already talked about them in
the previous video I wore one I'm
actually wearing them both today I think
they are so good I'm so happy about them
like honesty like I'm shocked I'm not
like shocked but you know when a proper
wouldn't a brand only does lip products
like you're kind of skeptical you're
kind of like if you'll need to live
stuff like I'm gonna do like pretty face
stuff but you just don't know you know
what I mean like yes I am close with
drawer cosmetics but doesn't mean I'm
not gonna be honest and 100% with you
guys and I am honestly so happy and
impressed with these powders
they're so good so this is what the
pattern looks like it's like a little
like you like you click it pops OH
it has a little guard here for the
powder and then you have the powder what
has like the GC imprint on it which is
 adorable
first of all this one is the star powder
in Lucy and then Marilyn is a more
golden the golden champagne
so they both beautify I'm wearing both
of them on my cheeks today to give me
this intense ass glowy cheek I love a
really intensive glowy cheek and these
give it to me hard once watching on my
hand real quick I'm gonna swatch Lucy
and the swatch Marilyn this is what they
look like on my finger Lucy is a rose
gold highlight very great for like 10
medium skin and Marilyn is a golden
champagne great for people with lighter
skin and medium skin let's watch it on
my hand so this one they look like
drunk-ass makes you guys do a great job
with these like they're seriously
 bomb bomb they also have
crazy amazing deals going on with those
because they just launched so I'll leave
a link down below if you guys are
interested they are a Philly things I'd
like to disclose that with you guys just
then you know and we are moving
along the next product I'm gonna be
talking about is the laura mercier
secret brightening powder
honestly this under-eye powder it is
amazing this is the most amazing
under-eye powder I've ever tried in my
whole entire life
Patrick was one that turned me on to
this powder and it is so freakishly
bombed because I have very Creasy under
eyes so I struggle with finding a powder
that really sets it with how D be
increasing throughout the day that's my
biggest juggle is I get like freaking
like cracks and crevices in my face and
I'm like well cool looks like I'm a 93
year old man or a woman gives you a very
light glow to the under eye as well it's
absolutely stunning how do you know how
to explain it it's just the most
beautiful like glowing under-eye setting
actually put a lot underneath my eye and
I kind of brush it away honestly like
I'm gonna crease anyway because I have
Creasy under eyes just I just do but
this is the most preventative powder
I've ever never ever used go to Sephora
and try this out at least get a sample
from them a lot of other Beauty people
on YouTube talking about this powder for
good reason it is so worth the hype it
is freakishly bone
get it I'm not kidding okay so the next
Pro talk I'm going to be talking about
is the cinema secrets makeup brush
cleaner the blue one holy crap this
cleans our brushes like done so I bought
this on Mimi's in LA which is ailing
beauty store I honestly have no
sort of buy this like normally if I were
to buy it from online I'll try to find
it in a leak down below for you guys
this little blue liquid cleans my
brushes like Kourt like I have no idea
like it could clean a brush that well
I'll get like a tissue and I'll dump
some of it on the tissue and I'll run my
brush in it and within like 30 seconds
it's dry and it's completely clean it
smells like really strong vanilla I
don't really like to smell it because
it's so overpowering and it's kind of
gross how vanilla he is smells but it
works so well it hydrates the bristles
it cleans the brush and disinfects it
has alcohol in it this is also a thing
that a lot of pro makeup artists use
they clean the brushes between clients
quickly I would of course still continue
to wash my brushes normally like in the
sink with like purity and stuff like to
actually do a deep clean every once in a
while but this is great in between steps
if you have like a dirty brush and
you're like I want to use it though
cinema secrets makeup brush cleaner okay
but still it is so expensive like this
this little bottle was $24 like what for
a brush cleaner oh my gosh is my
language so expensive and like the big
one is like I think 40 bucks I don't
even know truly is worth it because it
is the best brush cleaner like a quick
brush cleaner I've ever tried it's
amazing like amazing yeah right I think
we're gonna talk about is the thematic
lipstick in kinda sexy it's lipstick
coming right now
that kind of sexy is my favorite MAC
lipstick that they've ever launched it
is the most beautiful peachy pink nude
color it is everything I used to wear it
I Mac when I worked there all the time
I'll get compliments on it left and
right so what it looks like that's all I
have left
like I use this so much if you are
light if you are darker and complexion
if you're medium and complexion you will
like this you can pair with any lip
liner it is the perfect peachy pink nude
and it's matte but it doesn't feel too
drying and to mattifying Mac kind of
sexy is one of my favorite lipsticks
of all time it is beautiful and it's
easy for you guys to obtain this pick
you're just walking to Mac or like buy
on Nordstrom like it's so it's easy to
purchase and find so yeah you know so as
I already talked about is the new bounds
some lashes new bounds some it's and ubo
unsom I'm gonna call them new I'm gonna
call them new lashes the lashes I'm
talking about are the new black black
just discover this brand because my
friends are actually talking to me about
this the
slash brand Alex faction because early
is on YouTube he is creating a lash with
them my friend Jenny 69 she wears them
all the time she loves their brand so
basically they're a new sort of lash
brand but this is one package unless I
get to come all the way this is for like
the 3d inks that I'm wearing right now
and let's not talk about the style that
I'm wearing right now with them it is
the Bella minks these are 3d like flared
crisscross means they are my obsession
right now the lashes I'm wearing right

I love 3d means 3d minks are my favorite
kind of mink lashes because they do have
like that weird like flourish that kind
of looks like a natural hair and I love
that it's like my favorite it's my
