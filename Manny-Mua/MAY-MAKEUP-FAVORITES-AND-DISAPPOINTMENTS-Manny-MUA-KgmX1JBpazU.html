today's really is going to be a
favourites and disappointments video
I've not film one of these in I what I
feel is months I've been really busy
with travel recently and I feel like
what I'm traveling a lot I do not try a
lot of new different products like I
travel with things that I really know
work for me because I'm I mean I'm
traveling I need to be able to like be
secure in the fact that I want them my
face to look the way I wanted to you
know what I mean but I do have some
products I really want to talk about
they have really become like staple
products in my travel kit right now so I
know I've been loving them so much and
I've been loving these for the past
couple of months actually and I have a
couple of disappointments as well
because those are always kind of fun to
toss in I always talk about products
that I love so I need to toss in some
products that I don't always love you
know I'm saying
so after today's video is going to be to
my may favorites and disappointments as
always if you guys don't this video guys
do not like me please don't
watch it you know the drill with that
mixing so how do you say that because
that's if I did it but you guys do like
this video please subscribe to my
channel if you're not already and if you
knew what's up at mani MUA and welcome
to my channel thank you so much for
being here I really really appreciate it
but yeah it's going to get into this
favourites and disappointments okay guys
let's start with some skincare items
first I only have one to talk about and
this is from the ordinary this is a
brand new line that's carried out Beauty
legibly I don't really know much about
it I got a huge PR package sent from
them recently the ordinary advance
retinoid at 2% a stable emulsion of next
generation forms of a retinoid so i have
a lot of skin texture as you guys know
I've talked about my texture all the
time I just feel like I've texture all
over my face had little bumps have
little just under the skin abrasions and
so I always kind of struggled with that
and I've always had uhm those bumps all
over my whole entire life
so Laura Lee the home girl she told me
she's like to use retinol and I'm like
no I'm never really try retinol and she
definitely highly recommended using
retinol to me because it really helps
with texture on the skin and so I'll try
it and I got this package from ordinary
and I've been using this literally for
the past two weeks now and I've noticed
a change in my texture in just two weeks
I've noticed a change in my texture and
I'm like I don't know if you guys can
tell or anything that but I have
definitely noticed there's been less
texture on my skin recently and it's
been really cool it's really really
exciting and this product is like eight
to ten dollars I was shocked
the ordinary is known for really
inexpensive prices for their skincare
which is high-end skincare stuff so I'm
like what the hell
howdy suggest using a retinol in your
everyday routine if you guys wanted to
really solve some skin texture and
wrinkles and things like that I really
noticed a huge difference with using
this but you need to make sure that you
are using SPF when using it because it
is a very very very strong purified form
of vitamin A I think it's something like
that I don't really know much about that
 but it's really really intense so
you definitely be using SPF when using
retinol or retinol and things like that
so I use every single night and I've
noticed what's different I've noticed a
 difference so let's move on next
part talk about really quickly is the
cake in big sponge by Vera Mona I've
talked about this before and I
love I done a whole video on this to be
honest I did like a first impressions
I'm like the best Beauty sponge ever and
this is wrapped up because this is when
I purchased recently like I bought a
couple of myself and I just love I've
used this sponge so much this is one
that's been used right here in front of
me it's such a good sponge of soaks up
water so nicely it's not as soft as a
Beauty Blender but it picks up so much
less product than a Beauty Blender does
it deposits product so nicely so full
coverage so great at baking with powders
as well it like cuts lines so easily if
you guys are looking for a nice-ass
sponge to apply makeup that isn't gonna
break the bank it's not as expensive as
a Beauty Blender either it's like 13 14
dollars I would definitely check out the
Vera Mona cake and baked sponge it's so
freaking nice like next month I wanna
talk about quickly is the morphe prep
and set spray I talked about this as
well and I absolutely just love it the
applicator a bitch bitch not only do I
notice a huge difference in the
longevity of my makeup when I use it to
prep and set my makeup I love the
application how lightweight and airy it
is but it still gives you like a nice
full application it gets you everywhere
but it doesn't feel like your face is
completely drenched in setting spray I
don't really like that feeling I don't
like it where my face feels like super
super wet and intense from using too
much setting spray and I honestly never
feel it with this another reason I love
this one so much is because I love to
hack on really intense shadows on my lid
and like I like to wet my brush
wetting your brush with this is so easy
just like a quick spritz I literally
have like three
cups of this it's so good next part on
talked about really quickly is this
powder by Charlotte Tilbury this is the
price of your item this is definitely my
most expensive item on the entire list
of products I've been loving for the
past couple months this is the airbrush
flawless finish skin perfecting micro
powder that is a long name I just
love this powder so much because it
gives you such a beautiful bright and
awake look it I'm actually wearing it
underneath my eyes today just to kind of
brighten up everything this is where the
power looks like oh it feels like butter
it's absolutely beautiful I use the
shade one personally right this what the
powder looks like it's so Airy
lightweight but still gives you such a
nice amount of coverage super
brightening and super just beautiful on
the skin it makes it literally look
airbrush I'm so happy it's called
airbrush flawless skin because it really
does give you that appearance and it's
great for all skin types I've noticed
when even when I'm having like drier
days or drier likes patches after using
the retinol I've noticed that this
doesn't really pick up my dry patches as
much whether you're oily dry combination
I think you'll really really like it it
just sucks because it is a pricier item
I bought this one when I was at like
Nordstrom I saw this when I norm that's
where I bought this but it honestly is
so worth it and I would definitely
highly recommend using this powder me
and Laura bought it together actually
we're both like we lived next item is a
more inexpensive item that I have been
loving so much you can ask all my
friends I'm always talking to me about
this blush it's so embarrassing this is
the wet and wild blush color icon
pearlescent pink blush by wet and wild
I'm wearing it on my cheeks today this
blush is just so good it's like
the perfect amount of pink has a little
bit of gold reflect in it it's not the
smoothest feeling powder it's really not
so watching looking here but on the face
it's just so pretty this is what
looks like right here kind of a little
bit reminds me of NARS orgasm it's just
a much less intense version not as gold
chunky glitter as NARS orgasm it's just
a much more subdued version and a much
cheaper version since like what $3 I
have been wearing this blush you guys
nan stop for the last like three
months straight ever since I did the wet
and wild one brand tutorial maybe not
three ones like two months I've been
using this blush every day it's
embarrassing and I'll tell my friends
like guys have you tried on pearlescent
pink and they're like mani we know you
love the blush
I calm the down am i I would highly
highly recommend wet and wild color icon
blush in the shade pearlescent pink it's
a good ashy look good I think I'm down
to the last of my favorites yeah one
more this is a collaboration this is
from kim tae and cake face beauty these
are the lion-hearted lashes are actually
not in here because i just wore them
recently I think they're in the section
one yep they're right here they are this
a bottom pair of lash right here this is
what they look like they are so drag
they are drag as and I literally
live for them so hard I've been wearing
them non-stop this entire month
they're so beautiful there so draggy
they're so intense and they're so fluffy
and like they like when I open my eyes
like they hit my brow like they
are drag and I think him tie and cake
fake speedy did such an amazing job on
this pair of lashes and congratulations
to you guys again you guys
killed it beware though because if you
guys have smaller eyes this is a very
intense lash this is not like a little
like flutter lash like this is not a
cute little like wispy pair of nothing
these are drag as and they're gonna
look really big on you but on me I'm a
dude like they work on my eye shape just
fantastically if you guys have smaller
eyes just be a little more careful with
it just a little more careful with it
and so now on it to the disappointments
I have a to disappointments in today's
video one is this bitch why did I buy it
this is the 3 second brow actually did a
whole dedicated video on this I'll leave
it linked down below if you guys are
interested in it but honestly it should
did not work on me what so ever my brows
are too thick it just did not work I
thought the brow product was too dark I
thought the brow product didn't get put
down nicely I thought it did not get put
down evenly the whole thing was really
kind of a mess if you have less brow
hair than me or if you have no brows at
all maybe it would work on you I have no
idea but on me personally it just didn't
work and I'm like why would you spend
$20 on this and my other disappointment
for today's video is this little guy
this is the ELF concealer I'm not sure
exactly what's called I think it's
called like the flawless
HD concealer I'm not exactly sure what
this is called actually you just today I
felt this tutorial on this eye look and
like this face look earlier and I used
this I did a full one brand tutorial of
elf and I try
for the first time and I really really
really did not like this because the
color selection was horrendous I use
like the lightest shade this is in the
shade light and I use the shade fair I
think and they were both still too dark
the finish was so like oily and greasy
when I put on powder on top it came up
on like a brush I was like likes like I
was shocked at how much I really didn't
like this and I was like okay cool we're
gonna make it work and I definitely did
like three layers of this to try to make
it work as much as I could but it
creases super easily I don't know maybe
I was just using this wrong maybe I used
the wrong powder to set it it just was
not a good concealer I'm not bragging on
it because it's drugstore cuz I love
like Maybelline concealers and things
like that let me know if it works for
you guys and how you guys personally use
it maybe I was using it wrong who knows
but this was not a good concealer and
that's it you guys that's it for the
entire video on my may favorites and
disappointments products video I know
there wasn't very very many but I have
been doing a lot of traveling recently
and I didn't get a tryout that many
different products but the ones I have
tried the ones that are here I

fun to test out different products see

just never know with makeup so I had a
lot of fun at testing these products out
