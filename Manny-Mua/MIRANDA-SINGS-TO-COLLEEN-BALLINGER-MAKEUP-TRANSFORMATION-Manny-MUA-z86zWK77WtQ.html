please don't fucking watch any make sure
you're back yeah I'm here you like it
but if you guys do like this video
please like it and subscribe to both of
our channels yeah so yeah let's get to
this transformation I'll inter like
literally I know so as you guys heard I
was talking to Colleen about her skin I
was like yo what's his skin like and she
was tell me that her skin is very very
dry but her eyelids are extremely oily
so we're gonna go in is with a
moisturizer and this is the new Tarte
brighterdayz of moisturizer which gives
you a very pretty Pincus sheen to the
skin which I thought would be great for
someone that's more than oily side you
know I'm saying and I'm going with the
brand-new Urban Decay optical illusions
primer which is a really nice pore
filling primer for people that have more
porous pores and then I'm gonna go on
with the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD stick
my favorite foundation I'm so obsessed
with this and I just kind of swatched a
little bit on her face to see if those
her color and it was and so the lighting
is kind of fucked up guys drawing this
entire video so just letting you guys
know right now it's fucked but the
makeup and person looks fantastic
I thought it was so funny when I sprayed
the do I flash right on top of Colleen
she like freaked out she's like wait
what is going on so I did the dirt flash
on top just to kind of blend in and make
the coverage and everything look a
little more seamless and a little bit
more like satiny but soulful coverage as
fuck so I thought she would love that
finish of the duo flash on top and she
did she loved it
we're just kind of butting in right now
with the Real Techniques Beauty Blender
which is actually hers this is her own
Beauty Blender so she's like I have my
own Beauty Blender I just don't even
know and I'm like perfect we're gonna
use yours because I kind of waste one of
my like so what we can do now is we're
take the NYX color corrector and put
that underneath her eyes to kind of
cancel out any of the purple or darkness
huge because she does stay up really
late late and she works so much every
single day and I wanted to cancel out
the darkness from underneath her eyes
and they're going with the urban decay
make it weightless concealer over that
to go ahead and brighten up the skin and
really conceal what we want to be
concealed I thought this would be a
great concealer for her because it's
nice and full coverage but not too
intense and so we're gonna blend that
bad boy out with that same little
foundation brush no what the hell we're
gonna take that same little Beauty
Blender and we're gonna blend it out and
she really really liked how this looked
underneath her eyes I wanted to go right
up to her lashline and she loved it and
now we're sending it with the RCM a no
color powder underneath the eyes I'm
actually taking the RCM a powder and I'm
gonna set her whole entire face with it
and really concentrate to the areas that
have more of any kind creases so any
crease which areas I'm going to really
focus the powder on that and really cook
it into the skin as well as brush the
rest of it all over the skin to help
with her kind of face type so now I'm
gonna be taking the Marc Jacobs tantric
bronzer and put that all over her
perimeters of her face just to give her
a nice sunkissed glow the lighting is
kind of off again but in person this
really looks great on her and I want to
pin the hollows of her cheek of course
and anyone that you want to be bronzed a
little bit on the jaw line on her
cheekbones on her temples of her
forehead on the forehead and just by the
hairline I just thought this would be a
great color for her and she loved that
color as well and then everything a
little bit they come in a Quan sculpting
powder in the shade medium and contour
her face a little bit very very very
little just add a little bit more
dimension this coloring right now as I'm
going with this Tarte blush and then
shaded blushing beige this is a really
good coloring this it actually what it
look like in real life her color was
fantastic it looked beautiful on her
skin and it matched really really nicely
with her neck so there's Sun you guys
know this is a great color scheme like
this is the most true of all the video
and then I went in with a tart
highlighter in the shade stunner I
believe this is that's what it's called
and I highlighted the cheekbones and I
was like girl let's highlight the shit
out of you and she was like yes please
I'm feeling my fucking o's so we did
that and then a little bit of a Smashbox
primer water to melt everything now
let's go ahead and do the brows we're
taking the benefit to precisely brow
pencil one of my favorites of all time
and I'm gonna go ahead and shape out her
brows with the shade number five and
really really really carve out those
brows with some concealer from mac and
the shade and w20 what I use underneath
my brows and I really wanted to give her
some nice fullness but still make it
look as natural as possible that's kind
of why I wanted to accomplish on her
brows now I'm going with the smashbox
24-hour primer for eyelids because she
is more on the oily side and this primer
has been the best for me it's so
fantastic at keeping you not oily so now
I'm taking this morphe palette and she
loved it she's like this pretty
motherfucker it's a really really pretty
palette I forgot what it's called it's
like they're 25 shade palette and I'd
want to use it was such a pretty color
scheme I thought it would look really
really nice on her eyes so we used a
nice transition and we're going with a
little bit deeper of a color some more
of a caramel kind of warm brown shade
and we're gonna put that into the outer
part of a crease as well as in the inner
part of accrete and then taking this
really pretty maroonish color I'm gonna
really darken the outer corner with that
add some depth and dimension just
beautiful eyes and eye has a lot of eye
space I really wanted to work with that
and go into her crease and really really
play up her eyes and then we're taking
this really really pretty intensely
intensely metallic shade and that's
gonna go right on her lid and I figured
I'll just use a little my finger cuz it
works so why the fuck not
she loved as you live for it so now I'm
gonna take the same exact colors in the
same exact scheme I'm gonna run it
underneath her eyes and then take the
darker colors closest to her lashline to
give her a lot of depth and dimension to
give her that really pretty cat-like
wing to the outer part of her eye and
I'm taking that same highlighter that we
used on the face and a little little
tiny morphe brush we're gonna highlight
the brow bone as well as the inner
corner of the eye we really want the
eyes to pop and this is again another
true section of the coloring and looked
beautiful on her
and then I might do a little bit of
eyeliner I took the Kat Von D trooper
eyeliner I gave to her this one extra
and she loved it so I wanted to do a
little mini baby cat wing her eyes
aren't the kind of eyes that you want to
do really major dramatic wings with I
wanted to do a little
bibbling just collecting in father's so
many different eye shapes especially
hers and then I'm taking a little bit of
this a benefit brow tint to brush
through the brows to give it a little
more dimension because I thought there
were a little bit too dark so now I'm
taking Too Faced better than sex mascara
and coating her lashes she has literally
amazing asks lashes and I really wanted
to use them and like really do the best
that we could do with them and make them
really full and intense looking as well
as on the bottom lashes of course shows
beautiful lashes using you need to wear
falsies but of course we put on some
lashes so I took the style Lily lashes
in the shade Minako I believe and I
thought these lashes would look so
pretty on her I just I died for them so
I think they look great and then I'm
taking dulce K by Kylie cosmetics and
I'm putting that on to her lips and then
doing a little bit of setting spray by
Urban Decay oh my god I love this this
is so pretty oh my god ain't like you
yeah that's all
tremendous same time I love it okay
