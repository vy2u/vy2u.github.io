have to be my videos my glammy with it
hey guys that welcome back to my channel
so it takes for you you guys I have been
a seeing at this type of video floating
around for a minute now and I believe
that sofyan Nygaard I believe he's is
how you say her name
I know it's Sofia I actually met her how
to dinner once and she was the sweetest
that was amazing I think she actually
started this video where she mixed all
of her foundations together in to doing
one foundation on the face and recently
I saw Laura actually do and she inspired
me to do it because I thought it looked
so fun it literally look like a big-ass
science experiment and I was like I'm
very intrigued I literally have yeah
this is basically all my Phoenicians I
have at this place like my mom and dad
like they have like all my stuff from
San Diego so they have like my San Diego
foundations technically over there but
this is all these are all the ones I
have here at my house in LA and I'm
pretty sure this is gonna be plenty this
is a lot of foundations gonna take me a
minute to mix all of these together and
so I thought it'd be really fun to get a
little ball I got my little mug here
actually this isn't Akita when she's in
kpop for her that's what this video is
going to be I was gonna say here and
just kind of mix together all my
foundation so that'd be super super fun
thank you to Sofia and Laura for the
inspiration I'm excited to do this yeah
guys that's going to be taste video as
always if you guys don't like this video
because there's not like me please don't
 watch it you know the drill with
that what do you guys do like this video
please go ahead subscribe to my channel
if you're not already and if you're new
what's up many anyway and welcome to my
channel thank you so much for being here
yeah it's gonna get into today's video
so what I decided to do is I'm actually
going to kind of hey grig a situation
here so I feel actually see me filling
up this cup with the product I saw Laura
do this she like did like a little like
mounting situation when she recorded
looking down I wasn't there phone I
think was like her iPhone or maybe her
vlog camera I don't know that's what I'm
gonna be doing as well honestly it would
be impossible to like dismount my camera
do the whole thing I'm like Ninian so
we're gonna really try to make it work
with the iPhone instead this has a great
camera on it so why the not
I'm gonna try to set this situation up
and we're gonna literally just sit here
and mix we're gonna apply some a primer
because we want to really make sure that
we do this like Halo right you know
we're doing this hella right and really
fair we're just gonna go in with be
bobbi brown a skin base
we're gonna go off and just go in
and just prime I'm very intrigued to see
what the turnout of this is going to be
I'm so so curious
let me also do a little bit of you're
lucky I'm a cat and I have cat-like
reflexes
imma do a little bit of professional in
the t-zone we have to give this
foundation or 40 foundations a shot
we're also gonna go ahead and count down
how many foundations are in this we're
gonna see how many foundations we put to
mix in this bowl bowl and peanuts
Laura says that may be buggin like three
so now we're gonna do a little hit Greg
and you'll see me doing the mixing we
 go it's not perfect but it's
something
okay
okay you guys we finally finished mixing
up the concoction tell me this is not
like disk I'm sorry but for real
this looks vile I'm trying to destroy
the chunks you know there's chunks in
there I'm trying to really mix it in I'm
like okay we can them had some prime
right here and why it had more liquidy
foundations huh okay oh my god I'm
actually so excited I think we got the
concoction to a point where it's more
like frothy and smooth frothy I would
never want to describe a foundation
that's robbing them the moment of truth
we have a color here Oh bitch oh bitch
we're going in now how much do I use oh
my god this is so pale or is it so mean
that's the guy
do you see that chunk do you see that
chunk I feel like I'm painting almost
like I really do feel like an artist
right now I'm sorry I'm so cut I
can't help it you know okay now we check
our little real things you feels like
it's burning mm-hmm oh it's because I
just saved oh I'm like why are you
burning okay we're gonna go in okay come
on why is the color actually everything
though that's the gag of it all okay so
we have a full coverage here we have a
full coverage Queen full coverage punt
the gag of it all is that why am I
actually living hmm that's what I would
like to know is why am i living for this
right now why is the color something I'm
living for the finish I'm living for the
coverage I'm living for okay after so I
decide I wanted to grab a brush to go
with Nick dominant Nick and a little bit
more on the face to add some more
coverage i'm taking a morphe m4 39 by
the way if you guys are ever interested
in a brush that's really really good not
too expensive for like buffing up
foundation and giving you like a really
flawless finish I would really suggest
the morphe m4 3:9 it's kind of amazing
and it's only like I'm not saying only
like it's really like inexpensive but
it's pretty affordable for a nice brush
and of course you guys can use my code
at morphe you all know this I mean by
now come on y'all know I'm a morphe kind
of girl okay
I like doing liquid dummynet but I lost
my studio fix our nation and the powder
and I technically the color is still
like a little bit deeper than me
I'm not surprised cuz I like to go
darker foundation
oh my god okay I guess it's like
different areas or giving me different
chunks different finishes a little bit
more on the cheeks we can do it with the
brush I don't know why I'm living for
this so hard and like I actually a.m.
okay mix mix mix okay way so this is the
foundation right here
and honestly I'm slightly blown away
with how much I meant enjoying this I'm
shocked like it literally is so
beautiful has so much coverage if Feliz
have you on the skin not gonna lie I
feel like there's definitely foundation
on my skin definitely more on the satiny
site let's not do it stuffy not like
crazy do you hear anything that but it's
definitely not matte either it's deli a
nice satin finish with a nice a lot with
a lot of coverage look at my
face bitch look at this look it look up
close so close okay ready
we're not emphasizing the pores the
pores don't look crazy coverage is the
hair let's go ahead and apply some kind
of shine and Kylie ivory right there so
that's more of a warmer Kellie and we're
gonna do Kim kandi I wanna take a little
bit of bone and then we're gonna set it
with powder and then we will have our
final verdict of what we think I really
like the car you can see this by the way
I really just love them it was funny is
that like I actually never watch I
haven't watched one of am it but a lot
of people have been like comparing Kylie
and clap up concealer saying they're
similar I haven't tried them yet but I
didn't like the clip off concealer so to
me it's like confusing because I didn't
really love the color pop ones I only
tried it once though mase try it again
and I do live for Kylie so I'm like mmm
oh my god I'm so full coverage like I
could actually scream okay guys so what
I'm thinking is well I'm gonna go ahead
and do is I'm gonna check back in in a
couple of hours and see where we are act
with this foundation I'll know how I
feel about a foundation in three hours
like three hours is like my cutoff point
where I'm like bitch I know if I like
you if I don't like you so I'm gonna
weigh about 3 hours and see where we're
at with this face and this foundation so
I'm going to finish up my makeup and
I'll be checking back in later on
tonight to see what we think but so far
so good
obviously I'm mad as right now
because I just powdered everything but
how to give this a fair shot and
honestly I'm really
first impressions is I love it and okay
guys what is up I am officially back
I've had my makeup on for about three
and a half hours now or release my
foundation is on it's been on for about
three 1/2 hours random sign he's
actually the premiere of RuPaul's Drag
Race all-stars I'm going over to jails
and Joey's right now so I'm gonna get
going
but I'm gonna take off this makeup
before but I just wanted to talk about
this and do a quick little check-in
technically it's the foundation to end
all foundations like it's the
accumulation the foundation on my face
so this is what that face look like up
close so we can see I am definitely a
little bit more oily than I'm when I
first started out of course my oils have
started to seep through have a lot of
texture going on right now my cheeks
over here I think I'd like a little
breakout happening but hey you what can
you do you it's still looking so pretty
and honestly like I would have to say at
the end of the day this looked really
great and I think mixing all the
foundations was kind of genius and Sofia
you killed it and it looks so
incredible like I'm actually happy with
how mine turned out and I still feel
like I still have a matte finish to stop
super glowy and I think it's because I
feel like I have more matte foundations
than I do dewy foundations because I am
more on the oily side but I feel like it
just looks really really good of course
I'm getting a little bit Whaley and the
t-zone but I think it's a really pretty
oily you're not a up oily where
you're like oh god oh god all I'm not
always say that mixing all the
foundations was a win for me I think it
turned out so pretty anyway you guys
that is it for today's video I hope you

see you guys in my next video have a
good night or do whoever you guys are
