so today's video is been woo it has been
a highly anticipated video I have been
actually tweeted the other day and I
asked you guys if you guys wanted to see
me do a worst of a 2017 makeup video and
actually did one of these last year and
I completely forgot that I did it and I
went and I watched it I was like oh my
god I totally did this last year I
completely forgot I thought we were
really fun to do another one I up
and not in doing this year's video
because the things that I hated I didn't
put them in like a big basket or a big
pile or something where I could actually
go back and find them I was such an
idiot I did not even think of that I've
had people that do these videos like
they're smart and they see something
that they don't like and they put it in
a little pile for this end of the Year
video and I completely did not do that
so I'm missing some of the items I'm
gonna be talking about but I will be
inserting a photo in the video so you
know what I'm talking about and I do
have like some replacements here that
can just show you like so you can get
the idea of what I'm talking about it's
not confusing I just confused myself but
anyway today's video is going to be my
least favorite products which was a
seventeen and I just wanted to disclaim
in today's video just because these
products are in this video it doesn't
mean they hate the brand these are just
things that didn't work out for me
personally because it does not work for
me does not mean it's not gonna work for
you or if you have it doesn't mean you
need to stop using it or anything like
that I don't talk about that really
quickly because I feel like a lot of
people will get like I like that though
you know what I mean so I'm like oh my
god you guys like my little glitter
ombre it's like a little silver glitter
into a black glitter anyway guys that's
what today's video is going to be as
always if you guys do not like this
video if you guys do not like me please
don't watch it you know the
drill with that but if you guys do like
this video please go ahead and subscribe
to my channel if you're not already and
if we knew what's up man um your way and
welcome to my channel thank you so much
for being here I really appreciate it
yeah it's going to get into 2007 teens
Moses appointing worst of makeup
products
okay let's talk about this person for
most this was like the biggest brush
fail of the entire year these are the
Kylie cosmetics brushes and the reason
I'm putting them in the worst of pile I
mean technically it's not a makeup item
but it is in the makeup world it's a
brush set and the reason this is going
in to my disappointment video is because
of the price point technically the
brushes technically did work I cannot
say that they did not work they
definitely definitely did but the price
point was so high and just wasn't cool
you know I mean like I was kind of
annoyed by it and it actually cracks me
up because there was people that were
talking about youtubers doing the
videos on the Kylie cosmetics precious
saying that we are like just doing it
for attention and that the brushes work
so god and blah blah blah we're just
having an ulterior motives promoting our
own thing and update for me I mean I
can't speak for anyone else for me I'm
going to be honest no matter what it
doesn't matter who's behind the brand it
doesn't matter if someone thinks I'm
negative it doesn't matter to me at all
actually I don't give a fine I'd
want to say that this was a flop for me
because of the price point the brushes
did work but I just think the price
point was really really unfair and at
the end of the day I have your guys's
back I had the consumers back and you
guys love with these brushes I'm so
happy you guys stay because you guys
spend your hard-earned money on them
okay cool so next item that I was not
loving in 2017 was this Kara here this
is the Too Faced peach mist mattifying
setting spray okay honestly the entire
peaches-and-cream collection wasn't like
the biggest hit for me I also really
didn't like the highlighters like the
little putty highlighters had a peach on
them I did like the peach palette
thought that was really pretty and it
smells great I felt when I sprayed this
on my face my face looked like it was
going to crack off and the fine lines
were so intense like the whole thing was
just really really bad and I was like
why does my face look so fat and
I think it's because of how mattifying
this break was like I get a mattifying
spray don't get me wrong I'm oily I'll
spray some mattifying spray on for sure
but this was like to a whole nother
level where I was like can I have some
of my own oils back please like it was
really rough for me and it's actually
this smells so good
 me and I was hoping to actually
really would like the way the smelt and
the way I applied the mist beautiful
miss look at that mist it just
did not work for my skin
was Kenny one word for it to be really
honest this was by far like the worst
product 2017 for me like I couldn't even
believe this is a concealer this is by
simply me beauty which is the 7/11
makeup oh if you all saw the
video if you saw that
video oh my word I will leave a link
down below this burned my skin gave
you no coverage burn the of my skin
it turned orange mustard on me like the
whole entire thing was completely a flop
like I could not even believe that they
were selling this I'm not kidding when I
put it down on my skin it burned if
 uh-huh and I was like I
literally felt like I had fire
asshole you know like we have too many
hot cheetos and you have to and it
like turns out like really a bad
situation in the bathroom that's how I
felt my under eyes so it was
like not a good luck I did not like this
concealer what so ever and I would
highly not recommend that next I'll talk
about two pallets I did not like in
persona 17 so I don't have this
subculture palette with me I'm using
this as a subculture this is a
subculture in my mind you know so
technically the first palette is the
honest asius subculture palette to meme
that palette was just a flop because of
the fact that the colors were not
blendable yes they were powdery as
yes the color scheme was a little unique
that's like all fine and dandy right but
the fact that the colors were not blend
and they were blend into like a muddy
looking mess or they would just wouldn't
blend at all that's why I feel like I'll
have people have problems with massed
actually what I had the biggest problem
with and I was like bitch I cannot even
get like literally anything dive like it
was just not cute whatsoever actually I
used the person palette this is the
person palette and this is definitely
not in my disappointment video because
this one actually did blend really
nicely and they weren't nearly as
powdery so are those like a good
plus after the subculture you really
need to do this where I go and buy a
subculture like that's out and produced
right now and see the comparison between
the a subculture and my so culture but
but I only know my soap culture is if I
have a product I hate and I
never use it I don't mind if it gets
lost like I don't look for things so as
I get more and more makeup in and things
get lost there's like no way I can find
things so I didn't give a if I lost
though so coal trucks I've never used it
so I can't find it in my room I've no
idea where it could be
yeah subculture was the first pallet
mess and then the second one for me I
just really do not like this palette
this is the Bobbi Brown new drama
palette it someone looks like right here
these are the shades honestly just
looking at it I just hate it
like I just like I just don't like the
color scheme I think the color selection
is super weird I think that the product
like the actual shadows of themselves
are super just bad like they're really
flaky and chunky and powdery but not
terrible but they're not good like
they're definitely doesn't not good so
that palette is actually pretty
expensive things like about 50 or 60
bucks and I feel like this is like one
of the worst parts of the entire year
because honestly I can't even I don't
even want to do look with this I don't
even like the way this looks no scheme
it just doesn't make me happy actually
makes me violently upset so I would say
new drama pass on that one I don't know
man it was my cup of tea unless you like
those colors for me it was just an hard
no so next little guy I have right here
is not a shadow palette it is a face
palette and this is from L'Oreal these
are the two Match Lumi glow nudes okay
so I actually just got this last month
and truly it deserves to be in the worst
of 2017 because you know why okay
literally the most powdery chalky mess
I've ever experienced in my existence
every single sheen is powdery and
terrible it has no shine and it's so
disappointing because honestly I had
such high hopes for this I saw this and
I was like oh my god they have a whole
 Palais and I was so excited and
I feel like Maybelline killed it with
highlighters this year like they came up
with such amazing highlighters and
there's such beautiful glowing products
and I was like okay L'Oreal it's like
your turn to step the you stuff
your yeah but they came
out with this and I was like so this for
me was just a big flop because it was so
powdery I didn't go off on the skin
nicely it's very red chunky the glow
wasn't even there I really just didn't
understand this product whatsoever I
didn't like it at all they came out with
the lumi shimmery stes and these are so
much nicer if you guys were to choose if
you guys wanted to get something from
the drugstore like a glowy item of Lori
Elle's how definite suggest getting this
over the palette cuz he's actually
really really pretty and they give a
beautiful glow and I was like hard win
everything else I was like the
palette oh my eye is pulsing
because it's so bad like next
for a mascara that would literally was a
the flop of the year for me like
actually like flop flop and fish
this is the Rimmel shake it fresh clump
free volume do you this do this horse
ass shake weight
this mascara is the worst mascara I
tried of the whole entire year so when
you're putting it on you know when I put
on mascara you just like applying it
whatever I was putting this on hon and I
was blinking and it's so watery and so
liquidy that when I blinked it literally
splat on my cheeks I
 eyelid like I Liddy was
like huh
like I would like this like very normal
a normal blink was anything like hyper
crazy like I wasn't doing any of that
this was like a normal a splink
I got everywhere and I was like wait
you've got to be kidding me and it did
nothing and literally made my lashes
look straight and go down even more cuz
it's so heavy with how watery it was I'm
like bitch not only is this so liquidy
and so terrible at like giving me
anything it literally dropped micro that
just arty lugar like this right there
like this the krogan like this I'm like
okay they're really trying and in the
 mascara we like this next
product that I didn't really love her
understand in 2017 was this from Make Up
For Ever these are these starlet liquids
I truly just don't understand the
concept of this product so it's
basically like a nail polish right it
looks like a nail polish but it's not a
nail polish it's like for the face or
something like it's like a paint on
glitter situation and it looks pretty on
the camera and I'm gonna be wrong but
it's so chunky and hard to use
and it doesn't look nice on the eyes at
all because it's so chunky and thickened
intense you have to like shake this
bitch like gnarly because we're letting
us diffic some of you let it stay like
this the entire thing separates all the
glitter falls to the bottom and it's
liquid so literally looks like a duo
 two-toned ass thing I think that
this would work if you put it all over
your body or you mixed it with some
lotion or you did something with it but
for me it just didn't work because dad
came out with the the loose pigments the
starlet pigments which were
phenomenal and baked him out with these
at the same time and I was honestly so
shook up about the powders and the
pigments that I was like like living for
them so hard that when I tried these I
was like oh I don't like these like I
like those so for me I didn't really
understand this product if you guys have
this product and like it and use it let
me know what you use it for it because I
think on the cheeks or anything like
that it just looks chunky and heavy if
you wanted to use as a highlight it's
just too heavy and gross looking and on
the eyes it creases and it cracks and
I'm like nope weather was that no well
and we have our last product we are down
to the last product of the year that I
just really did not fly with very well
this is the Urban Decay vice liquid
lipsticks I wanted to
them I really didn't I tried them out
and I just felt like they work to
streaky one they were two strik II and
two they were two drying and I just left
you with like I'm not pretty lip you
know what you just didn't look good like
I'm let's go and swatch this is in the
shade 1993 which actually one of the
better ones but I'm gonna swatch it so
as you can see it's like the thinnest
formula and I don't know to me like
that's just not what I want to liquid
lipstick to me and this is from when
they first launched earlier this year I
don't know if they changed up the
formula I don't know if they've gotten
better or anything like that but when I
have tried the liquid lipsticks from
Urban Decay the Vice ones I didn't like
any of them that I tried they were all
streaky they're all too drying they all
just felt really nasty on the lip and
they just didn't look pretty so I'm
hoping that they had changed up with the
formula a little bit but I don't know
because it is from the first round I
never went out and purchased more so
that's what this is a liquid lipstick
that I really wouldn't recommend I love
her in a case so much it's like one my
favorite brand ever but this formula
just for me and for my lips and for what
I like usually didn't work out for me in
the best way possible and that is that
you guys that is it for the entire 2017
worst of Beauty 2017 products that
disappointed me I know what the I'm
gonna call this I have no idea like
technically cuz these things are not the
worst products in the world if you have
them all I'm sure you could use them and
it would work for you just fine but for
me because I am literally like I wear
makeup for a living like I use
makeup all the time so I'm a little
hyper critical when it comes to makeup
and now that I'm like creating my own
mine too I'm even more critical of
everything you know what I mean so it's
like like that one so yeah you guys so
this honestly to me this is on like good
fun I hope you guys don't take it too
seriously there's just products I didn't
like very much so at the end of the day
I hope you guys do I get offended by
this I know some people will get
offended by or some people will be upset
about it some people will say this isn't
for this and I'm just kind of like I
don't give a because honestly the
reason I do these videos is for you guys
and I do for myself you know I do
YouTube for me if I didn't like doing it
I would never do it so for me it's
really really important to stay true and
say honest to who I am and to always be
honest about the products that I love
her I don't love and I'm sorry if a
brand or a person gets offended by that
I have your guys's back at the end of
the day you guys are the people that I
care about and you guys are the ones
that support me and follow me and look
to me for an opinion or honesty and
that's what I will always give you I
will never give you something that's not
honest and something that's not forward
all I know is I want to stay honest
and stay true to you because you guys
wants to support me since the beginning
hopefully this video did come off too
harsh sometimes you can just can't help
it when you're on Tanner you know
there's like I'm talking to guys I just
feel like I'm talking to friends so it's
like but yeah you guys that's it for
