so today's video is going to be a fun
one I'm so excited to be doing this I've
not done a one branch tutorial in so
freakin long what makes this even more
special on top of the one branch
tutorial is it is the fact that I'm
actually partnered with Beauty lish on
in today's video Beauty lish is actually
a brand I've worked with many many times
probably making your third together and
we're gonna be using all Charlotte
Tilbury today I've not used at tons of
Charlotte debris products I've used a
couple staple products that are
absolutely amazing and those like
products that I use in my everyday
routine that are freaking phenomenal but
I have not used all the product I
thought be really really fun to do a
full face using Charlotte Tilbury
products because we are going to be
focusing specifically on the new instant
look palette which is this beautiful
powder here this is the instant look
smoky palette oh these guys are all
existing popular items for Charlotte
Tilbury and they got put into a palette
for everyone to try out so actually like
this is a really really really cool
thing for those who want to try out
charlotte tilbury products but don't
want to buy so many different products
and you want to try like one thing I
would definitely suggest doing it this
but yeah you guys as always if you guys
do not this video if you guys do not
like me please don't thank you but if
you guys do like this video please
subscribe to my channel if you're not
already and if you know what's up but
many MUA and welcome to my channel thank
you so much for being here also do not
forget all month of October we were
doing a giveaway on my channel every
Sunday I'll be announcing on snapchat at
nighttime who wanted the giveaway for
that week either you're gonna be getting
an iPad or a MacBook Pro all you need to
be doing is subscribed to my channel to
enter the giveaway that's literally it
be subscribe to my channel and boom you
are in the giveaway okay guys let's get
started
this is one thing I want talk about
really really really quickly beauty lish
is a brand it's an online retail brand
that has this wonderful wonderful thing
called flexible payments and this is
like my favorite part about beuliss is
that you don't have to pay the lump sum
of your total right at one thing so they
have two options now they have any
orders over $100 you can make three
payments interest-free over the next
three months so you don't have to pay
the lump sum right then they're like god
I want this product but you can't buy it
at that exact moment you can do flexible
payments which i think is absolutely
amazing and now there's a second payment
option for any order over $50 you can
make two payments those you who want to
do flexible payment but don't have a sum
total of a hundred bucks and I can go
over 50 and you will have flexible
payments okay guys so let's get started
on today's video first things first I'm
gonna prime the skin I'm gonna using the
chart silver yet magic cream mmm
you guys this smells rich we're going to
prime the skin with this you guys this
is such a beautiful soothing face cream
it's really really hydrating this is
like one of her most popular products I
think there's actually one of the
products that made like her line famous
actually a just hydrates your skin
beautifully and also Prime's the skin so
today we're gonna try this foundation
now I have not tried this yet this is
the start so get Magic Foundation
broad-spectrum SPF 15 and we have shaved
2.5 baths let's see this is oh she looks
a little light but it's probably
accurate that's really pretty I would
say this gives me more of a satin dewy
ish finish it's not really mattifying on
the skin so far I'm applying it with a
morphe M 439 it's like this will be the
nicest way to apply it because it's I
just feel like this foundation is a
little bit more of a medium slash sheer
coverage so I like to build it up a
little bit with using a kabuki brush as
gonna see you'll see some of my redness
from my pimple right there so it's not
like intensely full coverage or anything
like that but I would say it's a nice
like medium but it's nice it's like
really really genuinely pretty on the
skin and look I feel like it makes it
look like your skin but prettier that's
kind of the vibe I'm getting and I used
two pumps maybe we'll take one more pump
one water so now I'm just using a Beauty
Blender to Pat out any streaks I could
possibly have I always do this after I
apply with a thick a foundation brush
like a dense foundation brush I always
use a little Beauty Blender after make
sure I have
no streaks in the foundation or anything
like that possible the solid Asian
smells like SPF it has an SPF 15 so it
has a little bit of that SPF smell but
it's not terrible whatsoever it's not
like one that like is intense where
you're like holy crap hey SPF like how
you doing girl I think it looks really
pretty it's much more unnatural skin
moment for me I feel like this is much
more of a natural foundation is
something I can wear daily whereas I
wouldn't wear it to like a drag
convention you know I'm saying so that
was a plus that's a win you know why I
love working the Bueller skies I love
them because they let me be myself when
they let me be honest and they let me do
what I do let me do what I do and I
really really appreciate that it's very
important for me to be able to still
feel like I'm being me and not feeling
like I am like some type of like
sponsored ass like person whenever they
work with me every single time they've
always let me be myself and I really
really cannot thank them enough for
being like that really like you guys
didn't thank you for working at me I
actually get a lot of tweets from you
guys letting me know how awesome it is
too for flexible payment to be a thing
like I didn't even realize that they had
that until they told me and I was like
wait that's literally genius
why the hell does no one else do that so
I just realized I do not have any
Charlotte Tilbury concealer okay manual
waiting to be a flop on a full face a
Charlotte Tilbury tutorial so now we're
going Sarah on dries really quickly you
guys I know you guys know this about me
this is like my favorite powder ever the
airbrush flawless finish powder holy
crap this is mine yeah you guys this is
literally the prettiest setting powder
ever I would not have hit pan if I
didn't love it so much it honestly gives
you an airbrushed finish it sets your
makeup beautifully beautifully but it
doesn't like make your skin look heavy
and honestly you can keep applying this
this is a powder oh you can keep
applying over and over and over like
more and more and more and more and more
and it's not going to get cakey or heavy
looking it's gonna stay the same and
that's why I live for it so much it
stays looking good guys it stays looking
good do you guys recognize me I know
this is not the shit I usually go
foundation I usually am a lot darker
okay guys so now we're gonna dip into
the smoky eye instant look palette which
is this guy right here we have our
bronzer we have our blush of our
highlight and of course there's some
eyeshadows up here as well so this guy
retails for $75 and as I said earlier
it's a great value if you guys want to
try charlotte tilbury products like you
want to test out many versions of other
products of hers like this is basically
a mini spa
like it has the other products of
Charlotte in here other than the eye
colors these already blushes that the
line has a highlighter that the
collection has any bronzer that the
collection has so the shadows are the
exclusive in this palette I freaking
love her products they have beautiful
frigging product so I'm gonna dip in to
the bronzer this is the face bronze
section right here charlotte brush oh my
gosh just so luxe using this look at
that I did Wow high pigment it how are
you doing girl we should have really
really really blend this out it's
extremely pigmented Wow
living so far live being personally nice
to its that high-end price point honey
we get those high-end product with those
high-end price point chic you a why of
all so now we're gonna take some blush
or and take the cheek 5 and cheeks 6
we're gonna bounce them these guys as
I'm dipping in it there's some fallout
going on right here but they are powder
so there's going to be fallout of course
and as I said so many times I actually
enjoy a little bit amount of fallout as
long as there's like a good blend to it
and these products do blend very nicely
so I'm not mad at all
oh my god this is a really pretty fuckin
blush ok guys so far I'm really really
really liking my base right now so I'm
gonna take the highlight shade of this
palette right here we're going to
highlight the face so this guy is a
beautiful soft gold highlight I mean
it's soft if you want it to be soft I
feel like it's buildable yep available
she wants to be soft she can be soft she
can be dainty she wants oh she want the
bitch to be fuckin there I'm taking out
of morphe r36 you guys I really enjoy
overdoing it I really enjoy overdoing it
on the highlight guys like I really live
so I'm there for a fucking overdone
highlight I'm there for let's distract
them let's distract these bitches you
know actual just really like this is
glow because I feel like it's such a
pretty light soft it's like subtle but
it's there like does that make I don't
make any sense and it doesn't really
emphasize my texture a lot which is kind
of cool of course you guys can see I do
have texture there's nothing that will
avoid that but I feel like this hilar
does not emphasize it whatsoever I don't
know why I'm feeling myself so hard
right now ok guys so now we are I
thought we don't the base like this base
looks fucking nice like I'm really
really happy with this I think it looks
really really pretty I'm really happy
with the combustion products we chose
guys I love the foundation I think it's
beautiful I really like the palette as
well because I feel like it's a great
deal and her products are pretty pricey
it's a high-end brand too high in price
point also of course you guys know this
is vite
outer this is the powder in all powders
I'm sorry I said it I said it so now
let's go ahead move on to the all heat
those the eyes okay guys so we are going
to try the Charlotte Tilbury brow lift
three-way shape tool so we have a little
brow it looks like that it looks like
the UH Nastasia like teardrop shape
that's the kind of shape that has here
actually I think that Toby's brown head
at first no shade observation
I think we're using the shade Brooks so
we're gonna use a shade Brooks it puts
out a nice amount of product but it's
not like too heavy okay so we were using
the shade Brooks and I think now we're
gonna use a shade Naomi which is a
darker shade I think it's kind of
sickening that this is named after Naomi
Campbell I'm assuming it's named after
Naomi Campbell I'm not of course
positive but I feel like all of
Charlotte's names for her products are
named after like supermodels and famous
actors and things like that I mean my
chest the Kim Kate lipstick that
everyone dies for including me I'll
probably work today I think this color
just suits my brow a little bit better
what I like about this pencil is that it
puts down a nice amount of product but
not too much well you're kind of like
overwhelmed and you're like oh shit I
put too much down it's just enough Wow
okay she's really an aggressive brow
today
whoo-chow okay cool we're gonna go for
the Cara intense dickham brow I'm gonna
do the other side real quick and I'll be
right back damn who's this bushy brow
girl okay guys so I went ahead and
primed my eyes off the camera because I
do not have a concealer that means I
don't have an eye primer from her brand
I don't think that she has an eye primer
excited not see one so now we're gonna
move on to the eyes now I'm gonna take
the same palette guys this is a really
universal palette I'm gonna take the
bronze shade mixing it with the enhanced
shade right here
and Hance right there it took a nice
contour shade and I'm gonna put that
with a morphe and 504 fluffy brush and
put that into the crease we're gonna do
an easy everyday look I feel like a
child tillery's Brian is literally that
paid me of like enhancing your natural
features and like being like of a pretty
like a pretty look or who's no guy it's
like I wanna do a smoky eye isn't
terrible oh I do I really do no let me
see I'm trying to stay away from smoky
eyes all the time that's all I do
the shadows are blending beautifully
just how they were on the face I should
have called this video freakin full
faces in one palette that's what I did
let's grab the morphe M three to six I'm
taking the shade I brighten which is
like the lightest
I went to Brighton alright because
that's what it says making you take a
look at that I brighten again on my
finger and we're gonna put that over
absolutely a very soft lightweight wash
of color like more of a glowy satin
finish take a little bit of the
highlight shape of the face right on top
of that so I'm gonna take this shade I
smoked on it this morphe e18 right here
a little bit just on the outer corner
just to deepen it ever so slightly okay
guys before I continue I completely
forgot I wanted to try this out too this
is the legendary brow take a little brow
gel and the cute little comb I love it
the cute little brow gel just kind of
sculpts the brows in place like black
skies I like to really be sure that I
take a small amount of product in the
beginning and I build from there and I
don't try to overdo it with black
because I feel like I can go awry very
quick very fucking good I'm just taking
a and 4-3-3 for morphine just blending
out those edges I think once like
literally like smoke like it just feels
like I'm still gonna say this is still
pretty natural for me though can i I
hope I can cuz I would take that face
and enhance color guys
I must smoke out the lower lash line no
that's not smoking that's like a crazy
we're going to just make you a little
bit more coherent with the whole look so
I'm gonna say I'm you just just doing a
really really really warm toned look and
this is not very warm tone to me so we
do a nude in the waterline a black room
Brown iconic liquid eye pencil rockin
Kohl I cheat clever wasn't he then I
guess I like that we're gonna be that in
the waterline that is so smooth wait
down so this is what I quality feels
like okay don't know it's all using
before but uh cardio so now I just call
my lashes really quickly just give it a
quick little moment a curl I'm gonna
take V full fat lashes have not tried
this mascara yet I've not tried this
let's see how she oh she how does she
act we'll see I really enjoy a dryer
formula of mascara I don't like it to be
too liquidy like it gets all over the
place and it drops my curls so quickly
Oh like that Rimmel one that I just
tried in the other day now Ramone was so
bad oh my gosh in the in the tutorial
that I did like full face affordable
products
Rimal one was so bad I've never had a
mascara that bad in my whole life
so this one is a drier formula which I
very much very much enjoy this is well
oriented see that I wish my lashes want
to go streak down i wouldnt have to wear
falsies all the time it separates the
lashes pretty nicely there's not up a
lot that gets deposited on the actual
brush itself which is good because you
don't have to make an entire disaster of
a mess with it yeah I'm not mad at this
I'm not mad at this whatsoever
hmm oh I see you different okay so this
is the mascara right here this is what
it looks like
eyes closed looking down looking at I
definitely know it's giving me a nice
amount of volume and it definitely
separates my lashes nicely I'm gonna go
put on a pair of lashes really quickly
and I'll be right back to finish off
okay guys so we have some lashes on now
I'm wearing Lily lashes at Miami right
now now I'm going to move on to the lip
and we will be done with the full face
Charlotte Tilbury gonna lamb and I'm
thinking I can't decide if I want to do
Kim K twist or pillow top both are
fucking so let's watch a few H as we can
see ll talk right there it's done Kim K
West which is literally like my one of
my go-to news it's so beautiful right
there we also have nude Kate which is an
option I've never tried this one yet
done this is what this one looks like
right there it's like a peachy nude fuck
people talk someone like I think I want
a little bit of something you know let's
see what it looks like if not we got me
the pie
Kim K Weiss on top it's all good I'm
just dressed for this oh these lipsticks
they're too good why does this look like
my actual lip color like identically
she's doing a little bit of a Kim Kim
you know they don't
that stuff is unnecessary but then there
you have it Oh
No and there we have it you guys this is
the completed face look using all
Charlotte Tilbury and products this is
the most expensive full face part video
I think I've ever done and it would've
been a lot worse if I use even more of
the products so it's kind of lessons
here I honestly just have a lot of fun
at doing the one Brant tutorials I think
they're so fun to do and I think it's
really fun to grab a product or grab a
couple of products from a brand and do a
full face using only net brand to see
the products that you liked see the
products it you didn't like as much I
actually really enjoyed almost all the
products here today actually I enjoyed
them all yeah there's not one product
that I'm like oh that's rough
like there's literally nothing on my
face that I do not like of how it looks
I really like the foundation
I love the palette I loved the eyeliner
the mascara is really nice the brow
products were fantastic the lipstick is
stunning this is what I always hear
about Charlotte Tilbury lipsticks
