Rudolf blinding no I love it honestly

no no you yeah you didn't do like you
didn't you did me justice I'm actually
really really given time oh I'm so ready
oh my god and you're really making my
brows even more extra I can't wait for
like me to do a lunar Beauty campaign
and hire you as I makeup artists
what I don't owe you aren't like a
little sheep like a little skittish
anything - oh my god like I literally
feel like it's like lifted on my whole
face okay and the brows are on I did
that everyone she really did that you're
like so pretty that's very Gabi of you
gave us a more literally does like the
official 90 is very that so we're gonna
take my palette his personal I'm gonna
take like every color like here so you
know it's gonna do something fun yes I
live I was thinking like shiny nude
because that would be harder to mess up
or like should I take the risk and I'm
going to take the risk I think you do
great you said so she says you said you
practice on someone to force other than
your work just fine we're gonna take my
yellow cute that you've been really cool
again see their reviews and people like
having like their opinions on in and you
know honestly mostly everything's been
so positive like 95% positive she's a
good yellow don't wanna sing bright
yellow that wow it was so hard
and that's we're done I was so happy I
was like he really did half knew how
color like he really did that thank you
I'm really happy without everything was
turned down and now that people are
actually getting it in it's like praise
Jesus you know I mean it's so I know a
lot of people were like oh that's not
the most people to ye I've ever used I'm
like but it's pretty good we
also brought the morphe 35 be she's a
busted and crusted and must this is her
yeah I never thought she would make this
kind of debut ever but but she is I
don't have an orange my palette so we
have a closet black I would say that was
the probably black right yeah we're
taking this orange here this was like
such a good palette I'm so excited to
see this sunset I already know
cute I get to like tell my heads so far
back to see what to do it's cuz I can't
see I don't like that's like that
actually no I guess I'm like so let me
for this one I keep looking at the
monitor and not being attention enough
it's so cute it's time we're dipping
into miss Chi Chi miss can I live oh
yeah oh yeah that's all I mean first
pigmented as she is she buns pretty nice
honestly miss Chi Chi I'm like oh I'm so
excited for my next like stuff with my
brand too like I'm just so stoked of
course like I know that this is not like
everyone's cup of tea not everyone wants
to do like brights and you know things
like that but I'm excited to be able to
have like multiple things like coming
out with highlighters and lip products
and other palette honestly me too the
gag is that people are gonna be like how
come Kat does more dramatic makeup than
you do on you that's like I'm so ready
because I'm just uh we are connected in
many ways and I people feel the
slightest like negativity towards me I'm
like no because he's literally an angel
so stop it as you get older and you'll
grow out at the people please same thing
because my whole life I was like such a
doormat you know for other people
because I just wanted them to be happy
and I really care about my own happiness
as much because I was happy when they
were happy but as you get older you
start to realize like you know I can't
live your life like that you know like
you have to live it for yourself and for
the people that love you and I wish I
realized it a lot younger but I feel
like through social media that's what's
helped to me you know it sounds really
weird but like people depend on me on
social media nowadays yeah I noticed
that exactly like it is it is just it is
what it is and like you really cannot
please everyone so rather than like
focus are you dying trying to do it and
honestly that's how it was with my
friendships too like growing up I would
like bend over backwards for them just
to try to make them happy but even if
the friendship wasn't like good for me
you know you lose like a toxic
friendship or a toxic relationship in
some way be true to who you are if you
feel
a certain way about something like you
go with that oh honey she's everything
hi sorry I'm watching you likes watch
into smashed if you're watching this too
and you feel like the same way like
people please Orion just you'll grow out
of it and you'll respect to realize that
you can't live your life for other
people you have to live it for yourself
more and it's hard to realize but you
will get there but it was through social
media that I found that that's like why
I like everything you finding that like
helped you with your whole like identity
there like there's a lot of ugly in the
whole like social media thing and like a
lot of things to me like you still were
able to find yourself and that's what
matters yeah exactly so you have to just
kind of see through it with this eye cuz
it's looking so fiery yeah I'm going
with trade just to deepen that she's
looking snatched honestly put just a
little tiny bit a little shady here do a
little bit cuz its she's picking today
literally I'm like my hair so flat I'm
not a makeup for like having no training
whatsoever you're doing so well
like honestly like see that I'm not just
saying that other people I'm not even
kidding you have like the best eyeliner
