out everything to see what we want to

the creative okay juices well shopping
really a big part of it I'm right right
so we've pretty sharp everything a lot
of this is online awesome that I bought
in score mhm and um we
jit are going to be installing the stuff
thankfully Joey's here the muscle thank
God thank God yeah hoping a tanker
anything thank God
cuz we could do it we could do it we
could do it power to these guns we can
do it I think you guys should really do
everything until the correct you can do
it
agreed what I mean we can do everything
but you just do it better if some other
things and you just do it better looking
some other thing what is in this box
case I do something cute so we have to
open it for the vlog or hemorrhage
in this house here about me I'm just
opening it with the boys okay so we
needed something fabulously and comforta
block in black leaves I this is
what it is I don't know what I have I
don't look for having oh my gosh you
look so cute huh what is this oh my god
this is so cute
it is so sick it's like a sieve oh it's
a stool yeah it's like a see figuring
like a mirrored metal seat this is epic
this is freaking epic look at me
building guys I guess proud
this wasn't a number o number for Xena
Sepideh snatched and staff they are
there so extra just like me hey guys
what are we doing okay what are we doing
storage is key interview room right yes
storage is key
George's key so I found these amazing
dressers I was searching for dressers
for you had a ton of drawers petit now
so we could get to get you a ton of
smaller sources yes so the alux drawer
out hey leave me my Alex doors alone two
of these are you to bring in the other
doors but basically they came in this
really pretty super cute range of wood
top ramp but obviously that's not
necessarily the vibe that you're going
with with the blush and the light nuts
definite I couldn't find any dressers
with blush drawers
sometimes yes paint these Dorcas blush
pink blush pink and here's because I
like the subtle tonality that was
already going on right so these are all
different slightly like these aren't
colors a pinky yeah like that really
okay so more complex looking more like
just better give them more dimension and
like how cool are these poles super cool
see what else I brought you
which isn't question silver spray paint
Johnny they come in this is like more is
like a brass like a antiquey oh and
we're just pretty but with it with the
blush it might be really nice to go
you're gonna do that outside though
breathing about that yeah we're not
doing this you know or not ah cargo
doing this this is gonna be a custom
this is so custom just blush arrangement
of just for me more than that mani over
there so we have one coat onto the doors
right now with different layers and
different kinds of blush pink it's kind
of hard to see in this lighting but I
promise you guys there are different
colors of blush pink in here and it
looks sickening oh my god I've taken
over this Kate I've taken over
Manny's blog camera here's Joey using
the office how are those chairs this is
obviously the room the living room that
we decorated all right I'm gonna go
outside and spray me
there's my shoes they're from Free
People
if you're wondering okay guys I didn't
pick the best spot to spray-paint
because I'm right by the
air-conditioning so it's kind of loud
but I just wanted to show you guys do
the handles for all those dresser
drawers I just slurred I'm not drunk
people do ask me that I'm just naturally
annoying and I'm gonna paint them a
beautiful silver because Manny likes
silver and I totally get it and so this
is being looking-glass paint and what's
awesome about this is it's super super
shiny so since he likes mirrored things
and all of that but it's kind of hard to
have mirrored things when you're
shooting because it reflects all of the
lights and everything we're giving him
mirror light and Tuttle here are the
spray-painted silver beautiful he
handles for those drawers I just love
the shape of these they're kind of a
mid-century modern looking beautiful
tapered handle a really delicate but
also a nice big size it'll be easy to
pull in and out so Manny can access all
this makeup supplies and stuff we're
done we're done guys we just painted
drying
oh and lenses final Rush is here I know
come down Joe you wanna have feed me
nothing about clear this room bad this
is the before oh it was nice place this
is so we're trying to clear this area
and start to go at it guys dressers cute
chairs couch
yeah worthy we've it's rugged actually
sweaty swing boys its moist
I think it's because it like my cave
like way to you you know I feel like I'm
a surgeon right now oh yeah I'm not just
surgery yep calorie did you see how I
just cut through three layers without
even yeah drain without I just now
cutting the rug that's like careful
thing it's like look at that look at
that
that's bone Oh
the bone our skin the muscle girls don't
look at that look at that that's a
ribcage right there ya are and you and
baby ferret you're gonna live what I
like about it is high quality material
aka wool because you will potentially be
spelling in here right right makeup
essentially and it also has oh my gosh
all the cute this is gorgeous
and this is a joke detail and it's like
with silk details on wall to silk oh it
feels like yeah it's such a different
business right it has like a weighted
feeling in this part I'm literally so
such text you're all like I think it's
gonna go so well with at the blush tone
yeah room okay guys so the setup is
happening and we're thinking we're gonna
get artsy with these three frames we're
gonna insert our own art and do some
 right here a blank pad of paper
here and she can draw and you can buy
exactly and Joey's apparently sitting up
this bad boy we're gonna do keno thing
yeah so this is alright guys seriously
feel like this will be like the
centerpiece yes yes and then let me to
the complement it complimentary thing
genius so we have to figure out what
that is great a lot of time we're
creating a Christmas shade and we need a
round run oh this is genius the tabletop
from the living room yeah and we're
gonna use this round curve here to
sketch out the Archos of shape yeah
genius that is genius 1000 you're like I
hope she's gone it is you do it if you
did it now this is my pad or you can Mod
Podge a demain crafters that's like glue
apparently it's glue or just laying down
along or crescent shape oh and then
we're going to sprinkle in some silver
glitter
Oh bug now we have the Mod Podge all
there on our custom shape and you're
just gonna yeah glitter you're just
gonna sprinkle and it's and it's okay if
it gets outside of the shape because
there isn't any glue outside of the
shape for it to cling onto so we'll let
it dry on the glue area and then I'll
just brush it off got it
but obviously yeah you just want a nice
little coating don't be shy I look at
you tap-tap I'm like I feel like I'm
like using like like cosmetic glitter
yeah like what yeah exactly I mean it is
really fine I think that's maybe put
this on your eyes balls no it will cut
you okay mostly I do like cosmetic great
glitter
oh right well that's if it doesn't say
cosmetic grade then you probably
shouldn't use it okay look at Manny
making his moon me many moon child moon
goddess just seeing that huh it's so
shady or Cellini it was so good like
look how long look how the glitter clung
on to the Mod Podge at lonely sunspots
which is kind of cool it looks so cool
it looks like like moon craters okay
yeah it looks a lot of dimension so
amazing I love it look at it it looks so
good I'm glad we're adding this darker
outline and we are done with the our
project guys this is our side piece our
