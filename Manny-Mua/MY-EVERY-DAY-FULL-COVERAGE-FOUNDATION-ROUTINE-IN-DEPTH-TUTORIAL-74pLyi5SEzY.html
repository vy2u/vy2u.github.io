what is up you guys I feel like it's
been a minute since I've done a full
sit-down hitchhike a ride with me I
wanted to try a bunch of new stuff
that's out in the beauty community right
now taste video is also very very very
special because I have partnered with
Clinique to do today's video and I'm so
excited I am so excited I don't do a lot
of partnerships you guys know this I
don't just I don't do a lot but Clinique
is one of those brands where I'm like
dude if I can work with y'all and we
made it happen so I'm going to be using
the Clinique beyond perfecting
foundation and concealer this guy right
here it's in a box right now you'll know
why I'll tell a story later thank you so
much the clinic your partner to me
today's video I'm so excited so you guys
the reason I want to do today's video is
because I'm actually really really
inspired because recently I've seen a
lot of different youtubers do have
following am an emu a makeup tutorial
and I've come to realize that when I
don't have a lot of makeup tutorials up
right now like I just don't like the
people are pulling from videos of like
from 9 years back where I like pre
hairline pre veneers
I was chunkier and I'm like I actually
realized I don't really have that many
and also my videos were by really really
quick so I'll tell you be a nice way to
kind of do a longer video just kind of
going through all the steps of what I
actually do for my base I'm soon doing a
classic like full coverage to glam look
today and then really explain why I'm
doing the things I'm doing because I've
just kind of noticed as people are
following my tutorials it's a little
hard to follow you know and I'm like wow
mani like you should be a little bit
more like in depth with the things
you're talking about so that's kind of
what I wanted to do today is kind of do
a full in-depth get ready with me as to
why I'm doing the certain things that
I'm doing and why I'm placing certain
things here and there and with the order
of things and whatnot so I actually have
nothing on my face right now I have not
done to get ready with me and I'm menage
a trois ok guys I'm gonna stop rambling
what's going to get into today's
okay that's the first things first of
all I want to do is I want to go ahead
and use a moisturizer on my skin because
moisturizer is very very very important
so I'm going to be taking the Bobbi
Brown vitamin enriched face base which
is like my go-to moisturizer and what I
have to do is I just like take my beauty
sponge this one is from morphe and I
want to go in and just start putting it
all over the face with this one I'm not
really like a balancing it with
moisturizer I like to just kind of
spread it and actually wipe it across
the face because that's gonna spread it
a little bit faster for me
moisturizer is really really poor ting
you guys to have a really nice clean and
moisturized base for your foundation
whether you're gonna go in with a
luminous foundation or they go in with a
matte foundation good base dark good
skin like that's just the bottom line so
this is like almost like a moisturizer
slash primer to me it is a skin and base
so now I'm gonna going with a primer and
primer is actually really great for
different multiple reasons there's ones
that are more radiance boosting Zoar
some that are great for pore minimizing
there's some that are great for oil
control primers are all over the place
and you can get primer that caters to
you mostly today we be taking the tacha
silk canvas primer this is the one I've
been using the most recently and it's
the one I've been loving the most as you
can see I've gone in honey can you see
how much I've gone in on here I like
just just take a little like back of a
brush and get like a pea-sized here it
comes with a little like spatula but I
was like it's fine I know you guys saw I
liked about this primer so much is that
one it's so silky
it's called silk Provence for a reason
it's a silky primer has three different
types of silk in it it's really great at
making your pores look smaller keep the
makeup on longer and it just makes your
skin look beautiful and so prepped for
makeup and I would like to really press
it into the skin
so I'm pressing it into the skin because
I really want to ensure that the primer
everything really sinks in goes into the
pores goes into the fine lines is just
something I've always done this is my
beret for your primary recently it's
just like so good not to grant keeping
your oils at bay or anything like that
but we're gonna be using powders and
stuff like that for that if you are more
in the oily side so prep wise I really -
use a moisturizer then I go in with a
primer that's really great for poor
control and poor look so I have big
pores guys yeah
the pores aren't there I need like to
like shave off like seven layers of skin
before I even get less pori you know I
mean it sucks
I really freaking suck it is what it is
and I'm a dude I have man skin have
larger pores I have more textured skin
than the average woman would so that's
just kind of what it is any of you guys
so now I'm going in with the foundation
so this is what we've been waiting for
this is the cleaning beyond perfect
foundation and concealer it's a two and
one
so cleaning of course they sent me their
foundation
recently I got like the big PR packets
in the past I've used a foundation and I
really really really enjoyed it so I was
like dude yes let's do it
I have no idea where those foundations
wait I think it's like between like a
move things keep missing here a lot in
my house so they sent me another package
with a couple of foundations
I said deliver it on the delivery wasn't
at my front door I'm like okay codes
they original my house it was someone
stole it for my freaking step right all
right someone stole it and so I decided
to go out run out and just buy my own
sheets because I'm like you know what
I'm just gonna go buy my own I don't
want to like wait any longer like I
don't want to wait and I feel bad you
know Mike's muscle for my thing like
that's not here I went out I bought
these at Sephora myself cuz I just felt
guilty you felt guilty yeah I'm sorry it
is what it is so I listened earlier this
is the Clinique beyond perfecting
foundation and concealer so basically
guys what this says what the claims of
this are is that supposed to be a two
and one a foundation a concealer that's
full coverage without the heavy weighted
full coverage feeling the retail for
this bad boy is $29 which i think is so
so fair for a higher-end foundation it
was in 27 shades and you guys can visit
any local Sephora to check out the
clinic two and one foundation and
concealer all the Sephora scary them
they carried the complexion product so
if you want to hop into a Sephora check
out the concealer I would do so I
grabbed these shades
number two alabaster and number six
ivory both of them are neutrals in the
VF very fair and neutral family so I
grabbed six and I grabbed two I don't
know anything like hmm so we're just
gonna go ahead and just go right on Ian
okay let's go in with a number two first
I just want to see what it would look
like and it comes with like this big doe
foot applicator which I really really
like it's not gonna work for me that's
gonna work for me okay this is already
like a good color for me alabaster
number two and I grabbed number six what
was I thinking sweetie come on now I'm
going with the foundation now you guys
in places I want to be a little bit more
covered right I'm also gonna use this as
concealer because it is a two-in-one
concealer so I'm putting it and my
concealer areas and also brighten that a
little bit later on and we're gonna
blend that out
I'm putting the areas are seen okay so I
used to really put my foundation
everywhere and I would put it all over
my beard as well but honestly I kinda
like stopped doing that cuz I was like
you know what I'm over it huh I'm over
it honey
okay so I might have put a little much
all right but it's blending so easily
you guys honestly these this is such a
good foundation I was so happy when
cleaning asked me they're like yo do you
want to do a sponsorship on the
foundation I'm like yes because it's
honestly so pretty and it really does
act as a
great concealer and foundation honesty
in this color actually really is it's
quite nice quite nice on me I'm using
that morphe sponge like I talked about
earlier this is like my favorite beauty
sponge it's only seven bucks like I
really feel like you just can't go wrong
you know it's frits Bernie you can't go
wrong and with this you guys I'm
pouncing into the skin and I'm not
rubbing like I was with the moisturizer
because pouncing will give you such a
beautiful finish and it'll make sure
that the coverage is still there as we
can see it's looking snatched it's been
over the years to just make sure
everything is cohesive tell me this does
not look beautiful on the skin tell me
it doesn't
yeah cuz it does Oh Clinique y'all did
that with this foundation and concealer
honey your dude okay guys so now that
our liquid base is on it's done honestly
I'm really liking it I'm so happy it
blends out so effortlessly like I like
the applicator I think you just dot it
on and and swipe for more coverage it
just looks really really beautiful and
I'm like living like Grom living so now
I'm gonna go ahead and set the under-eye
you guys I'm taking the k'kaw under eye
setting powder this is in the shade
number one I'm gonna go ahead and bake
this is the baking powder I'm gonna bake
underneath the eye just to ensure
everything is set in place and looking
snatched a Torrey well I like a lot
about this powder is that it's so finely
milled and you guys the reason I'm doing
this is I'm gonna go ahead and bake the
under-eye and make sure that it doesn't
crease on me I have very crease
susceptible eye is very Creasy and it is
what it is it's just a genetic thing
like I just naturally crease a lot in
those areas so I like to really go
overboard and set with powder it doesn't
really matter what powder mostly needs
to be a translucent setting powder
definitely but that's the reason I'm
setting in this area right now as I'm
setting I'm baking letting it settle
into the skin and the more it settles
into the skin the better off we will be
and it'll last a little bit longer the
rest of the face I'm gonna be taking the
Born This Way by Too Faced which is
another great great setting powder super
nice super lightweight just feels and
credible taking the same Beauty sponge
I'm actually putting that onto the
forehead the Born This Way toothpaste
one and I'm setting the center of the
forehead with a brush and I'm adding a
lot of powder so I'm putting a lot of
powder on the center of my face because
I'm gonna be baking the center of my
face I think it's really really
important if you are more on the oily
side adding excessive amounts of powder
and letting it sit there for a little
while really will help ensure that it
sinks into the skin and you really
definitely get longevity with your
makeup so people people say like the
older baking
cooking they're setting that's what they
mean they're really making sure that the
makeup is staying in place by
excessively using a lot of powder on the
perimeters of the face I'll just use a
brush I don't mind I'm not gonna cook
their perimeters in my face because I
don't get oily up in my temples or on my
cheek but down here I don't get oily
really so anyways I don't get oily I'm
just gonna set naturally like I normally
would with the brush I'm gonna be using
a sponge or I'm gonna be using a really
really dense packing brush and really
putting on a ton of powder sweetie a ton
look at that look at this you see that
Center that's right on the most oily so
I'm using the most amount of powder just
a little tip and trick for y'all because
you guys are wondering if you guys
always wanted to know about like baking
and setting and whatnot like why people
do that also if you guys might have
noticed I used a dry Beauty blender with
the k'kaw Beauty powder it's meant to be
used with on a dry sponge not a wet one
so you guys wondering like man you are
using a different applicator for it
that's why because it's meant to be used
dry it's like a very silky powder it's
not one that you use with a wet sponge
guys now we're gonna let the setting
power do its thing you're gonna go on
your phone you're gonna go talk to some
trade you can go on Instagram you're
gonna flirt you can do whatever you want
to do okay now we're going dust off the
excess powder taking any small I feel
you just like a small precise brush that
get a little under-eye brush okay so now
that we have everything dust away this
is what we look like right now
looking real pale that's normal we're at
a pale point right now so next what
we're gonna do is we're gonna take a
brightening powder underneath our eyes
I'm just gonna lightly sit underneath I
wanted to have a really bright under eye
for this because we are using a
foundation and concealer as our base
it's nice nd the same shade so we're
gonna brighten up a little bit with some
powders I just love how brightening this
powder is like I just love it and I'm
putting it in my areas I want to be a
little bit brighter on the sides of my
nose the forehead a little bit just a
touch on the bridge of the nose on the
chin on the Cupid's bow just this is
just like a brightening powder it's not
anything to ham nothing too crazy okay
so once I have everything powdered and
set in place now we're like really
powdered what I'm gonna do now is I'm
gonna take a fix plus for example
anything like this would work a touch of
luminous setting spray I like to
interchange between both of them they're
both sprays to help kind of combat the
powder enos of the face because we have
a lot of powder on right now so I'm
gonna take the talked to luminous skin
mist or fixed bus it doesn't matter
which one you want to do I'm gonna do a
little bit above my face like this run
into it hmm one of those and I'm gonna
take my same Beauty sponge I just use
with
like this I swear there's always dots to
happen seals dots I don't like it I
don't like it at all
two sprays on here so I'm gonna do I'm
gonna go and press over the foundation
so this is going to help kind of combat
the fact that we have a lot of powder on
right now and we want to make sure that
we're looking not only flawless and full
coverage cuz we are oh who you are we
wanted to look a little bit less powdery
taking the backside of the morphe sponge
and we're just pressing into the skin to
give us more of a luminous glowy finish
back to the skin and doing that will
ensure that you look a little bit more
natural rather than so full coverage
where you're like you know covering up a
village now we have like almost like a
luminous soft glow to the skin and that
will help give us more life while I'm
waiting about to set it I'm gonna take a
little bit of a Mac Studio Fix powder I
run that down my neck I found it finally
so we're gonna put that down the neck
just to make everything the same color
because I'm real pasty on this neck I
mean you know you can do this with
liquid foundation wherever foundation
that you wore in your face you can take
it down your neck if you want to I just
enjoy taking powders on the neck a
little bit more just a personal
preference this is what we have we have
a nice full coverage base but it doesn't
look so kicking and so powdery and so
heavy that's what I really really wanted
to accomplish we're gonna take the new
Too Faced and milk chocolate Soleil
these are the new bronzers these are
actually bunches that they already had
they revamped and repackaged everything
so they look like these little muck
around this I'm gonna take this same
brush this brush I've been really really
loving recently like this is one that
I'm like oh honey game changer for me
this is the morphe r1 it's a tulip style
brush so it's fluffy as heck then it
goes into a point so what I've been
doing is I've been using bronzers with
this I've been bronzing my skin and then
going into like the point inside going
in and carving my contour and stuff like
that I just been really liking this so
I'm gonna take this milk chocolate
Soleil that's a pretty color on me it
smells like I will eat that chocolate it
does so bronzer really helps with making
your skin look a little more healthy
giving you more dimension so what I'm
doing is I'm bronzing up the skin on the
perimeters of my forehead just to give
me a little bit more of a glow keeping
the center of my forehead M dekes I
wants it look like more like
concentrated here and then now we're
gonna go and just hug the cheekbones
right underneath it which this brush
does so well it literally just hugs my
cheeks so well there's no one's faces
one dimension people have discoloration
people have texture people have things
going on in the skin so when you matte
it out so much and you only wear
foundation it just looks really thrown
and I think using bronzer blush and
highlighter and things like that really
helped combat the weirdness of the fact
that you're only wearing just one color
on the face taking a little bit of
mascara D on the very tip of the tulip
right in there
oh I just like this Marshall might for
this reason it really just concentrates
everything and blended out so nicely as
you can see I am contouring I'm adding a
little bit more of a cool toned show you
that shadow underneath the cheekbones
just to really emphasize these cheeks I
don't have the most highest cheekbones I
don't they're there they're flat is a
board
only I want flat right now is my chest
and we have fine cheekbones so it kind
of sucks but we're gonna go ahead and
cheat the system we're gonna use these
shades to combat that and make it look
like we have these beautiful higher
cheekbones that we really don't have so
we're gonna go ahead and apply some
blush now again another thing that will
help really give us like an awake
luminous glowy appearance not really
glowy necessarily just more of a
lifelike look we want to look alive I
found the video we want to look on live
and I'm going to apply a little bit of
blush on the apples of my cheek so when
you smile mmm yeah like this fatty
pocket right here chunkiness right there
honey so I'm going to apply right there
lightly and just pull it backwards blend
it into that bronzer and contour this is
like easiest way I have found that
blends blush in my sleeve is by applying
it to the apples of the cheeks pulling
it backwards and blending it into the
bronzer that's some blush on right here
so I'm going to apply some a highlighter
on the cheek bone and this part is
really just one of the more fun parts
about makeup is because you really get
to emphasize your cheeks you gotta add
some glow I'm gonna go ahead and take a
morphe r-36 what I like about this brush
is that's a very concentrated amount you
can apply a concentrated amount of
highlighter and it really just sweeps
nicely back to the temples so I'll just
take some highlighter and I'll apply it
and take it all the way back in to the
temples right here mmm
and I also like to do a lot is applying
a little bit of highlighter to the
temple right here because I feel like it
gives me a really cool shine and Sheen
when you turn your head mmm
miss Audra and honestly I do not play
any games let me do this so I'm going on
the top of my cheekbones that's a very
pivotal point at the top right there
right at the zygomatic bone and sweeping
it backwards and lightly just blending
it into the blush like so I always like
to go down the center of the nose with a
highlight just cuz I feel it gives me
more of a pinched small nose appearance
I'm gonna contour my nose too but I
always highlight my nose first and then
I don't know why it's just more of a
personal thing now I'm highlighting the
rest of the face I'm highlighting the
Cupid's bow it's just a center spot I
like to highlight I don't have a very
prominent one a little bit on the chin
just to give me a little bit of a glow
right here the ones chin is like a flat
chin okay so we are highlighted to fill
you guys can highlight whatever you guys
want to but this is just something that
I like to personally emphasize boom
blinding you guys so now we're gonna go
ahead and contour the nose I know it's
intimidating I get it so I'm gonna take
V cap 1 DJ light palette I'm gonna take
the cool tone shade right here and I'm
actually take this on a fluffy I brush I
just notice for me these have been the
easiest thing to use and the reason I
like to highlight my nose first is
because I feel like I can like it's like
my guide so I'm just gonna follow along
the bridge of my nose
very very light pressure to emphasize to
highlight and to give me a more snatched
cute nose I just kind of take it into
the fridge with my for it as well I
doesn't really make a huge difference
but it's just enough to make me want to
scream oh you know I like to take it on
the bottom of my nose too just to give
me a little bit of it like a little like
hmm if it wasn't so freaking of a long
of a recovery for a rhinoplasty girl you
know mama what I had it already oh she
would have I would take a little bit of
a brush that were to use before just
kind of lightly brush over it just to
blend everything a little bit better
this is the face this is the statutory
of it all this is like my go-to I really
like doing this kind of base I like the
full coverage but with a luminous like
glowy sheen to the skin this will ask me
a good like 10 hours on the face and yes
I'll have to block throughout the day
but it will last really really nicely
and the clinic foundation last up to 24
hours on the skin so that's incredible
let's go and focus on the brows now and
the brows are a whole nother thing
that's another demon in its own and
actually really funny because I've been
doing my brows really differently
recently not like so differently where
I'm like oh my gosh I'm like a new
person but definitely differently enough
where I like notice the difference like
I've been doing more of a fleek bro I'm
gonna do that one take it morphe m15 8
this is a fantastic brow brush it's like
the thick at the ends but you can like
make it thin right which what we doing
I'm going to take a little bit of the UH
Nastasia soft brown all made I know you
guys are thinking like why you're taking
dip brow what I know but I just take the
bottom of the back of the cap and I'll
make my brush flat and I like to start
with the bottom of my brow and really
focus and cost rate the product on the
bottom of it first because I want to
have a nice like house like a nice base
you already it's like a little home
right there just starting it up and I
just go right in and as we can see it's
gonna get dirty
it's totally fine because I'm gonna be
cleaning enough after anyway and then
when I'm looking straight forward
I want my arch to be right at the end of
my IRA so right there's when I'm not my
arch to be at the end of my eye boom my
brow follows it pretty pretty well this
is just me personally doing like a
little guideline for myself to see where
I want it to be so I'm taking that brush
I'm drawing it at the base of my brow
and really just emphasizing the base of
it first I'll take whatever I have left
on that brush and I'll fluff it upwards
the spots that are missing hair or that
I just look a little bit more bald as
you can see it already looks so much
more full I'm not dead back in to get
more product yet I really like to use
what like whatever we have left on the
brush not too of a heavy hand to do the
front of the brow it's filling it in as
I go hey guys so now that we have the
beginning part of my brow so now I went
and I dipped back into the dip brow one
more time and I'm gonna go in with the
shape and I'm gonna start shaping out to
the edges of my brow this is where I
want my arch to be so this is gonna be
my highest point all right here and just
start to follow my natural brow down
like so and as you can see it's not like
the cleanest brow yet but that's totally
fine so we're gonna be cleaning it up
after and when I'm doing the bottom of
my brow like to hold the brush very very
close like almost at this kind of
straight angle
it really helps let put the excess
product that's on the brush into the
actual brow I'd like to go a little bit
thicker sometimes I don't want to go
thicker here just kind of pants on my
mood y'all you'll get to you into your
own rhythm on the brow that's kind of
where I like to do with the brow right
here so this is the shape I kind of want
to keep it now we have the brow filled
and overfilled of course as you guys can
see but that's kind of what I want
because I want to have a really good
like guide of where I want to keep the
brow or how thick I want to or not want
to have them so I'm gonna take that same
including two and one foundation
concealer and I'm gonna use that to
conceal my brows on enmity that our
morphe m42 one fantastic flat detail
brush really really good at doing this
kind of thing because it gets so flat
and so precise and you can do whatever
you want to do you can make a brow as
long or short as you want but this is
just me personally how are you guys
liking this video I feel like I'm being
much more informative today of like how
we're doing things it's not as like
funny and camp me and like being
dramatic and fun and crazy but I feel
like I really wanted to kind of show you
guys some things that I do I feel like I
haven't done this in like a really long
time and I feel like you know why I'm
like a beauty guru what I'm quote like
beauty guru you know what I mean so I
feel like I should teach you guys as
much as I can but I don't know what kind
of level you guys are at when it comes
to makeup and I just want to show you
guys the things that I do without being
too like
you know I mean too gung-ho I don't know
that makes any sense
I don't know if I'm even make any sense
to myself right now what am I saying
okay now we have browsed on this where I
have the man so far this is just what
I've been liking recently sometimes I'll
do a more natural version but this is
what I've been liking my browser so far
so I feel like it photographs very very
nicely so when I primed my eyes off of
camera prime your eyes basically means
that I'm gonna be having something for
shadows to grab onto whether you prime a
concealer foundation I personally use
the Mac Paint Pot those work
fantastically almost like a concealer in
a way but they last a little bit longer
on the eyes it conceals my darkness on
the eyes like any discoloration veins
things like that and I'm so excited
because say I wanted to use this bad boy
right here I grabbed this this is the
k'kaw Beauty X Mario they did a
collaboration Kim Kardashian and makeup
I wear over to collaboration and it's so
oh ho mag hide me
so basically did a palette to glosses
and a lipstick wanna try at all this is
what it looks like right here I mean
this is the unicorn of the palette it's
this great packaging very minimalistic
that is the word I was looking for when
reviewing Kim's concealers it's
minimalistic is the word so this is the
palette this is what we have these are
the ten shades in it this retails for
$45 which i think is a very very very
pricey price point 45 bucks for ten
shades when they're not large pans I was
like well that's kind of like pricey
that's just you guys at your discretion
wherever you guys think and of course
they came out with two glasses and a
lipstick again very minimalistic
packaging I think Greg is that a really
masculine touch because Mario is a man
and he's freaking just sweating just
thinking about him okay anyways this is
a collaboration basically they've been
working together for ten years that's so
sweet so what's going to dive in to this
palette I'm so excited I'm so proud of
Mario for doing this I think it's really
fun even though I do know Mario
personally I don't know him personally
really have better one time but that
doesn't mean that I'm gonna be biased
towards this collaboration as I said
earlier I do think that already it's
already expensive I think it's a really
really expensive pricey palette I said
so their goal as a brand is to be more
higher-end I believe that's just I don't
know anyway I think that the price is a
little high this is the palette right
here I'm gonna be taking this shade in
Miami which is the middle top shade and
to get really bronzy brown and I'm
taking out of morphe M 504 I donno if I
said that already but basically look
already and they're very pigmented as we
can see right away boom pigment I
honestly wouldn't expect anything less
stuff from Mario and cam I feel like
they're so known for like the bronze the
eyes
is definitely something more on the
bronzy side today for the sake of this
palette I mean Mario's a celebrity
makeup artist like he's gonna know what
he's gonna want to use and what he's
gonna want to like and what kind of
products work well for him so it's not a
surprise to me that they're blending
very nice together they're very
pigmented so very pretty very pretty I
like that I like that I'm using that as
a transition shade transition shade
basically means that one goes one shade
first as it's like a lighter more
neutral shade that the other shades will
blend into easier so in case you guys
have ever never heard of that before
plus I'm going and that's why I'm using
a larger fluffy brush I don't want to be
too too concentrated and too pigmented
but I want to be a nice flush of like a
nice burnt orange colored and basically
I'm just kind of following my own
natural orbital bone I'm having my eyes
open a lot as well so I can see exactly
where I want to place the shadows where
I would still be seen because I do have
hooded lids as you guys can see like I
have a hood there right there I have a
little bit of it so when my eyes are
open you can't really see a lot of
shadows what I'm doing is I'm making
sure that the shadow falls right above
the hood of my lid so I can still see it
even when my eyes are open at least the
transition I'm taking a little bit the
shade decade which is like the really
white creamy shade same brush I'm gonna
put that on the brow bone just to help
me blend in those colors same brush is
for a better blend on the brow bone
right there take a really really pretty
creamy baby white color alright then
this is the eye so far looking snatched
so now I'm gonna go in with a more tight
compact brush this is a morphe r39 great
for more compact work great for blending
but still applying more of a shadow and
I'm taking the shade Albanian and I'm
gonna do a little bit of it on the outer
corner this is a really really warm red
and brown there's a lot of red undertone
and as you can see it's very very very
warm as well beautiful shade my goodness
clear so Bri this is like one of my
favorite clothes ever though I'm
obsessed and I'm just gonna do a little
bit of a halo I've decided in this exact
moment so the reason we believe down
that first color is that we can go in
with a color like this it's a little bit
more of an intensive shade and so we can
blend out of this shade into something
and not into nothing and it's fine if it
doesn't look very very blended right now
because it's not going to we're gonna go
in with a morphe m5 before same brush we
used originally and we're gonna go ahead
and blend out those edges right at the
perimeter right at the border of the
product and blend it cuz you see when
you're going with these like darker
shades as soon as they get a little bit
darker it blends gonna be a little bit
more real I'm gonna go with the shade
loyalty which is like the deepest
darkest Brown of Hallett and that's
gonna go on a morphe
nice pencil brush now I'm gonna have to
really really really define the outer
and inner corner of this halo I anyways
the reason where you've been going with
the darker shade after we could just
have stopped there but the darker the
shade at the end like it really gives
you so much more dimension and depth
when you're doing this kind of look you
guys honestly these shades are blending
so nicely like I'm so happy with how
that are turning out so far honestly you
guys so now what we're gonna do is were
going to go into the center of the eye
now and I want to do something more
Goldy there's a couple gold shades in
here there's like me not gold but like
satin so our take the shade Armenian on
our finger where she can take it on our
finger right here it's a golden Jade
imma put that right on the center of the
lid there's just gonna be a classic halo
I talked to me anything too crazy
nothing to cut like nothing too harsh
came in Mario makeup is very classic and
pretty and I'm inspired by that right
now because this is their palette and
now going back in with that are three
now we're gonna blend in blend between
the shimmer shade and the matte shade
just a light blend you don't want to
look too harsh at least I don't want it
to look too harsh so I wanted to look
really blended and seamless I'm gonna
take a little bit that silvery shade but
right the center of that just a hair ooh
a very layered look but I'm living so we
have so far you guys what do we think
I'm sorry that I look so stunned it's
not my fault we're doing basically this
evening at the bottom and we did at the
top we're gonna go ahead and blend out
it's a warm brown color that we use
first Miami or in a smoke we're gonna do
a smoky lower lashline I know Kim likes
out really smoky lower lashline and so
do I so she's so pretty taking them
shimmery bronze we're really taking it
there - you guys we're taking you there
now we're taking that little silvery
shade it's a very very flaky shade
this one's texture is different than the
other shimmers in the palette by working
on more 439 now we're gonna concentrate
that on the inner corner the effect of
it is actually quite stunning I think it
looks really nice it's very reflective
okay guys so these are the eyes right
here this nice little halo eye on the
tops very very pretty
I'm loving it so I'm just gonna go and
do my eyeliner and lashes off-camera and
do mascara on camera because I think
this video is getting really really
really really long and I'm sure a lot of
you guys would like to learn about that
so if you guys do like this video give
this video a like and a thumbs up and
I'll definitely recreate another one and
I'll focus more on the eyes and more on
the lashes the liner I just wanted to do
a quick little wing nothing to him
anyways I'm gonna go and do the lip now
and we will be done with today's video I
want to take the Urban Decay's stark
naked lip liner this is a lip liner I
use for literally every single and
neutral six that I own
just follow your natural lip line with a
lip liner it's very very easy just to go
along the edge of your
own lip let me personally I'd like to go
right above it just cuz I feel like I
have a very flat lip line or what I like
to do is i overdrawn this Center and I
go up into my real lip line as I go
outwards right here I'm following on my
real lip line but then I go right here
and it's a little bit lower
you guys so now we're gonna go in with
the Kim and Mario lipstick in the shade
okay so this is the classic Kim lipstick
this guy retails for twenty US dollars
four grams of product in here let's go
and compare that to a different lipstick
real quick so for example a Kylie
lipstick has a 3.5 grams of product in
it this one has four oh you get more
bang for your buck let's go ahead and
apply this on the it goes on very nicely
oh my goodness let's say there's
definitely a peachy nude color feels
very nice this is classic kay right here
and it's going with one of the glosses I
want to take the shade of super nude
these retail for $18 there's not a lot
of product in this is 325 grams that's
beautiful
let's see a color pop glass has how much
product in here three grams
this one has 3.5 so actually you would
think that there's not as much product
in here because it's a smaller amount
but you actually get to 3.5 grams for
example this color pop glass has 3 grams
of product I will say though that the
product itself worked fantastically so
if you're big fan of came in you're big
fan of Mario and really really really
want to buy this stuff you will get a
great product in your hand you
definitely definitely well it just
depends on how much money you want to
spend realistically and this is the
final look for today's video
