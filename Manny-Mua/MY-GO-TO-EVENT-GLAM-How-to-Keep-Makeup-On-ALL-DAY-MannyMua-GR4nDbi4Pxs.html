as you can see I'm wearing Regina today
I'm wearing Regina my pink robe and I
love so much and benefit it's the best
robe ever face videos white to be my
go-to glam for any event that I go to
this is literally like the go-to look I
do like maybe 80% of the time I'm going
to an event this is my go-to look I hope
so you love looks like this I do a nude
lip and eye smokey a bottom lash line I
a bold winged and glittery lid I think
it's so pretty and so complimentary on
so many different kind of people this
look is also kind of paired with my 12
hour plus makeup I actually put a
pull-up on Twitter asking if you guys
wanted to see a look that kind of help
ensure that you're making but stay on
for 12 or more hours this will stay on
me
all day long so this is not only my
event makeup this is also makeup that
will stay on your face for 12-plus hours
even if you are oily I am oily and so I
really needed to find a routine that
would work for me that would keep my
makeup on for a long-ass time before I
even get started I love people I know
are gonna comment like everything you've
ever done before and like you're just
like you're not in a clear like it's a
mess like exactly what you do always um
yeah that's kind of the point in this
video this is my go-to glam for events
so if you want to comment like oh my god
you're so boring you just say nuts all
the time bitch is not that this is not
the vision for it because it's literally
that's the point okay
that's the point but yeah that's
what today's video is as always if you
guys on this video if you guys don't
like me please don't 1j you
don't row with that but if you guys do
like this video on you guys do let me
please like this video and subscribe to
my channel if you want already and if
you knew what's up I'm a anyway and
welcome to my channel thank you guys for
being here and joining the maniac fold
and family I love you guys so much if
you guys are watching this I really do
appreciate it and thank you so much for
being here
but yeah it's going into this full face
full glam 12 hour plus makeup tutorial
so let's get started on today's video
today I'm going to be doing my full face
event routine so what I always do at
events usually if I join makeup in the
morning I'm out to like midnight and so
my makeup will be on for like 12 to 16
hours and it's still looking pretty
freakin good there's no patches on my
face I might get oily throughout the day
I mean I do get really throughout the
day but my face is still really really
really intact so that's kind of what
we're gonna be doing today so what we're
gonna do first to keep my makeup on all
day and so I like to do always is I use
primer I'm gonna be taking the step one
makeup forever
um smoothing primer this is great for
oily skin so let's use primers as
silicone in it so what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna put it on the center of the
nose send over the forehead and blend
outwards
I get oily in the t-zone so I'm really
focusing the product on the t-zone as
well as on my pores and just kind of
patting patting motions over the pores
would really help fill them in I know it
sounds terrible but filling in your
pores is really gonna help keep the
makeup looking more smooth and not so
texturized okay great so now we have
primer on I'm primed and ready to go I'm
going to be taking the Loreal Pro matte
infallible this is the foundation I
actually love this for oily skin it's so
honestly like it's a drugstore
foundations like eight dollars but it
works so so well I keep my oil at bay
and keeping it full coverage some should
take that on the Beauty Blender and I'll
put that on the t-zone only I'm not
gonna put it anywhere else I'm putting
that on the nose and a little bit on the
forehead or basing like my nose in the
center of my Ford that's what gets the
most oil e so now what I do it with the
rest of the face I've been doing this a
lot recently this is like my kind of new
go-to routine I've been taking the Make
Up For Ever Ultra HD stick and the KO
Gendo aqua foundation and mixing these
two for the face what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna take the shade 120 and that's
gonna go on my cheeks this is a really
really really a yellow foundation for me
so I use the Cochin o to kind of help
neutralize it because that's more of a
neutral foundation and to kind of make a
little bit less coverage so I'll put
that everywhere
Beansie way I'll put that everywhere and
this will not even put like like on my
neck slightly and you guys know I don't
like putting liquids on neck but because
this is a cream I feel a little bit like
less what's weird about it I don't know
something about liquids I give me the
 he be Jeebs you
feel me and then I take the Coach endo
take about two pumps for one side in the
two plums for the beside I know it's so
excessive but this is really what works
for me I'm take the Beauty Blender and
that in I really start blending up the
foundation this combination you guys has
been my go-to for about a month and a
half now I love mixing foundations
because you get the best of both worlds
for example I love the coverage of the
ultra HD stick and the finish is pretty
but I love the finish so much more of
the co Gendo so mixing them together
will give me a nice full coverage
luminous finish very skin light but
still full coverage AF and that's what I
really like you know and then for the
next take a buffing brush does it give
me some color back to the neck because
usually I like to go dark with my
foundations because I feel like in
photos it looks better because my
highlight will look more prominent so I
really do like that effect so I'll bring
it down my neck so it doesn't look so
different and intense you know I have
been so living for the shape tape
concealer by Tarte you guys this is like
one of the best concealers I've ever
tried in my life full coverage crease
resistant smells lovely like what I
don't even I can't explain how much I
love this concealer right now I like to
go really full coverage underneath my
eyes when I'm doing these events because
I need the makeup to stay on all day
this will be an excesses tutorial it
might look oh my god like you're putting
so much makeup on because I am I'm
literally trying to make it last for 16
hours sometimes so a bitch guy do it a
bitch god I did you don't mean so this
is what I'm doing blends out like a
drink like a dream land of all
the concealers I've ever tried I think
this is the most crease resistant of all
the concealers I've ever tried I don't
know how Tarte did it but I'm glad they
did so I'm gonna take a dry Beauty
Blender and I'm gonna take de la Prairie
loose powder I've been using this a lot
recently underneath my eyes because it's
so lightweight but still sets everything
perfectly I love this powder and so I'm
gonna put a good hearty amount
underneath my eyes pretty bud resistant
I'm just making I'm just triple checking
here I'm trying to be for the
back rub you know so that I'm also gonna
put it in my smile lines this loose
powder right here a good hearty hefty
amount of it because I'm gonna be
brushing it off later anyway this powder
is really really really good at setting
the makeup and helping a bead crease
resistant so while the powder is cooking
a little bit on to the face I'm gonna be
taking the colour-pop super shock cheek
and the shade spoon and that's gonna go
on my highlighted areas this is gonna be
my pre highlight this is just like
honestly this color is a little thick
it's a little intense it's a little
glittery but underneath a highlight it
really makes my highlight pop like no
other and I
when my pilots popping elephants and
then I'm take the alors Mercier
translucent setting powder this is the
best face powder to keep your makeup on
all day long it's so good it almost
gives you like a full coverage powder
effect it's like the weirdest thing I
can't even explain it but what I like to
do is I'll grab it on the back of a dry
Beauty Blender on the back of it I'll
pounce the little bootie and I'll pounce
this everywhere that I have liquid look
how much is on my nose I'm using a lot
of product here if you are oily this is
a step you want to do I promise you I'm
Lee and I need to bake this face and
baking honestly I'm sure you guys all
know this by now but cooking and baking
the face means that you're really
allowing powder to settle into the skin
and making it almost foolproof that like
the foundation and the powder or
whatever is not going to come off you'll
notice that when you put on a lot of
powder in the beginning of your face you
wait 10 minutes and there's less powder
on it because the powder is soaking into
your skin and I know it's kind of bad
like not great for your skin but it's
gonna really ensure that the makeup is
on a lot longer you can use a powder
puff for this it doesn't really matter
I'm just using a dry B Linux is what I
have in my vicinity and I don't know
where I powder puff when we're gonna let
that sit for a little while our face is
setting and it's cooking with bacon and
it's in the kitchen or Betty Crocker
we're chilling set the neck nothing too
heavy just to make sure it doesn't
transfer over like taking off for sure
so I'll let that settle and cook for a
couple minutes and just leave the powder
that is you can see how just like powder
here there's powder here this powder
here here it's a lot of excess powder
bargainer you brushing it away after
anyway so don't even worry about it
we're gonna be using another powder to
dust it all off Rachel that's been
sitting for a little while now so I'm
gonna take one more powder and I'm gonna
brush off everything on my skin I'm
going to be taking the Naked Skin ultra
definition at loose powder Patrick who
is the one that turned me on to this
powder it is absolutely amazing it's so
lightweight so ultra fine but it really
does give you a nice HD finish I'm
really just gonna kind of brush up
everywhere all over the skin super super
lightly we're not using a lot of this
whatsoever I'm running out another
does all the excess powder that I don't
need on my skin and this is going to do
a really pretty nice smooth appearance
great turn out nice and smooth out in
nice and matte lookin nice a nice full
coverage nice man looking I really like
home looks okay so now when you're going
with some bronze I'm going to be taking
the Marc Jacobs tantric bronzer this is
my go-to bronzer it has
for a couple months now this is what I
always wear on every single event this
is just my go-to bronzer I love it I
love the color it's stunning and it
blends so nicely and I'm shaking this on
a morphe eetu brush comes gonna go in
bronze with the temples I like to really
bronze up my temples and my face because
I really like to look more bronze and
glowy at events but usually there's
flash photography and I'm already so
light that I really do like to have some
dimension to the skin so I will be using
a lot of bronzers and contouring and
things like that so that's what we're
doing I'm just putting this all over my
temples and on my cheeks this apply my
favorite bronzer I've ever tried because
it's the most blendable and it's one
that least picks up on my dry patches
and on my patches that don't take
pigment so that were eyes I'm bronzing
and glowing and beautiful liking where
you wanna take some highlighter now I
like to go in with a morphe M 510 brush
I just love this brush so much it's
great picks up a nice amount of product
and it puts down a lot of product as
well so that's why I like this brush a
lot for using highlighter umm why should
we go with it guys I know we're gonna
take the champagne pop champagne splits
I don't really ever use this blush at
all but the champagne pop color is
freakin amazing and so I mean honestly
Jacqueline killed it of course again
with the champagne pop color like I
forgot how much I loved it and I use it
like in a tutorial recently and I was
like oh we're gonna pile that bad boy on
the cheekbones just lightly go over see
that look how glowy that is damn
whatever I'm going to events I kind of
like to put the highlighter lightly
above my brow bone to catch in the
photography I will always take a lighter
highlighter it doesn't matter which one
this is the sleek salsa palette are you
guys know I love this and I'll take a
little bit of that really bright one
right here now at the toppest most point
just barely to let my cheekbone like in
certain angles will look really like
blinding as you know for blushing
people are ever wondering what blush is
I'm wearing at events and vert it's
always BEC got a flower child and Becca
wild honey mixed together I'll go in
first with the flower child and then
I'll go in with wild honey
literally I'm just a brush dust it off
the excess and start going in and I'll
blend it right between the bronzer and
the highlighter so as you can see it's
just a nice blush color that just looks
so flattering and pretty on it will look
so nice on so many different people this
is a fun tutorial because it's cool to
be able to like let me tell you guys
like all my products I
on my face when I'm going to an event
because a lobby will always ask me and
I'm always like oh my god like there's
so much involved with it I need to just
fill a tutorial so finally now that's
happening on mic thank God so now I'm
gonna be going in with this this is the
shade of breakup by makeup geek which is
a porcelain type of contour shade on a
more feet 50 so I'm gonna go in and
start really just carving out the cheek
with this really nice cool tone contour
color my skin is very warmed up in
bronze II from the bronzer obviously in
the blushes like that so I'm really just
really working in this cool tone shade
to make sure that we get some nice like
definition on the outer corner of my
cheek I love make it come to our shades
they're so beautiful Arlena killed it
with these good job babe I freaking love
them so now I'll go in with a more high
lady type powder I'm taking the Marc
Jacobs insta marked filter you guys know
I'm obsessed with this powder and I'll
take a sharp like brush thing something
like the morphe m4 3/8 and I'll load up
this color edge a little bit by my nose
to make Lily have a smaller nose and
just kind of pinch the highlight
together towards the nostrils and then
I'll also put it underneath my contour
to make a look like a more sharp defined
line alright tomorrow here to really
start cleaning it up as you can see now
looks like a more sharp defined contour
now we're gonna do a little bit of no
snatching because I always snatch the
nose when I'm at the vents you know so
I'm gonna take that same contour shade
that we were using and just a little
like eyeshadow brush I'm gonna run that
at the top of my nose and bring that bad
boy all the way down just start
snatching the nose to make it look a
little bit more petite and small I am a
 dude and like to have more of a
petite looking nose but I'm really not
down for freaking a rhinoplasty so we're
kind of just meeting it in the middle
here I mean I'm not against it I'm not
against the surgery at all I love it I
love that exergy but I'm just saying I'm
really not in the mood to go through a
nose job right now you know she's not
feeling it if I wanted to I would but
yeah maybe in the future who cares but
now what I will do is I'll cook the
sides of my nose I'll take this morphe
m/45 8 great for nose cooking amazing
and I'm just gonna press this with
translucent powder I'll usually take the
Laura Mercier Chen loose in and I'll put
it on the brush and really start to
click the sides of my nose so this is
kind of what I have my face at this is
how I like to do my face when I'm going
to events or whatever
I am oily and it's still stay
on it really works though cooking what
the powder it works so I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna go and do my brows on camera
what my nose kind of cooks in a little
bit more and I'll be right back
okay great so we have the brows
completely done so let's go on with the
eyes now whenever I'm doing an event
makeup i always go between these two
palettes especially this one recently
i've been going through my pallet and
the Anastacio modern a renaissance
palette these have been my go-to
palettes for events and these are the
transitions that i like the most so I'm
just going to be mixing interchangeably
between these two um feel free to just
get one or the other it doesn't really
matter but I use these always like all
the time look how Torah my palette is
I've been using this bad boy for a while
now and like you guys know this has been
getting some love okay guys before I
even start doing my makeup though I
completely forgot I need to prime my
eyelid so this is my go-to primer it is
the smashbox 24-hour photo finish primer
this will keep my makeup on for
literally 12 plus hours really does
ensure that my shadow does not crease my
liner doesn't really transfer as much as
i'm using this i have oily eyelids and
so if you have oily eyelids out nothing
suggest using something like this
smashbox 24 hour or like the mac 24 hour
one their very very very very similar i
mean they're both owned by us a letter
denotes a very small amount of it it's
completely clear i mean if you have like
veiny lids you might want to use a
different prior because this will just
really give any coverage or anything
like that honestly I don't really care
because it really keeps my makeup on a
lot longer and I notice of all the
primers and all that my primers I've
ever used this one has been the most
godsend to me so now I go with beaches
and cream I'm gonna go ahead and take
that into the crease and is just going
to act as our transition shake it you
guys I'm a freaking crazy psychopath
about blending and transitions and
making sure everything looks really
pretty this is from my palette this is
just going to ensure that I have
everything that blended seamlessly it's
a really pretty beige e transition shade
works great on light to medium skin
tones and if you're if you're darker in
complexion it work as a great matte
highlight because we not only have that
beaches and cream into the crease as you
can see it's very very very light it's
not too intense but it does definitely
give you a nice transition and that's
kind of what I was going for sooo I'm
gonna take a morphe and four to three
and I'm gonna go in with Sora and frappe
mixed and I'm gonna put that on the
outer corner and start to really add
some definition and dimension I'm gonna
put Sora and frappe into the crease
giving it heavier on the outer corner
and then I'm scrubbing a little more fat
pay taking that a little bit closer in
to the inner part of my eye keep my eye
open everyone be sure where I'm placing
the shadow putting that right into the
crease and upper crease so now we have
that on the outer corner and it's nice
and defined I'm going to take the shade
Aphrodite from my palette on a morphe
g27
and that's a go on that outer corner and
really start to add definition and
dimension into the look to really start
to bring some life back to it and start
to give it some really nice cool depth
and 4 3 3 just blend out those edges
it's too harsh and too stark I'm
actually gonna take some of the colors
from the UH Nastasia palette as well I'm
going to take these shade golden ochre
if I can grab a
brush I just like how this color looks
mixed with the oranges I remember that
right above the surah and frappe shape
just to give me some more transition and
just look more of a seamless blend and
not make it look so orange this is gonna
help kind of neutralize it and that
looks so social to warm from my palette
the shade
luna and that's gonna go on to my lid to
give us a nice bright open awake lid and
isn't actually gonna be our base color
i'm gonna be putting glitter on top of
this i wanna see you guys it's so funny
that like I created this palette like
it's literally my go-to I use this so so
much I'm just so happy that like I
created something that I actually use
all the time it's not something
that I'm like I just created just a
created stuff just to put my name on
something you know I created it because
I truly love it and this is something I
use so often and I'm so happy that I've
been getting such positive feedback and
I have been since it first launched from
you guys on this palette it just makes
me so happy that you guys love it too so
I'm gonna take the ardency in gel
eyeliner pencil and that's in the go in
my lower lash line or my lower waterline
this one in the Marc Jacobs one of my
favorite pencils like they're just so
good and I'm taking a morphe 43 brush
I'm gonna blend out this black liner the
reason I'm even doing it just to make
sure that there's no skin marks in
between the black and my lashes and now
that we're blended out with the black
I'm gonna go in with the UH Nastasia
palette taking red ochre and Sienna on
that same morphe brush and I'm gonna
blend out the black so this is what the
bottom of the lash line should look like
it's just nice and smoky and just really
really pretty and just gives me a nice
little umph of something-something so
now for the fun part we'll be taking the
macro reflux pearl glitter and system go
all over my eyelid I absolutely love
this glitter I literally wear this so
much so we're gonna do is we're take the
two-faced glitter glue this is what my
favorite glitter glue I've ever tried it
just works so so so well and I'm gonna
spread that on my eye with a morphe m42
one this is like my glitter glue /
packing glitter brush it's like so
 - arpan nasty but I mean I just
found one brush I like this is Gregg's
it's so flat and defined how much I
placed on the lid and just kind of press
lightly everywhere all over Luna and
then I take reflex pull on my like index
finger or whatever finger you want to do
or brush whatever and just press that
right over the eye as you can see it
looks freakin amazing
I will never know because with this blur
it's so good to me and if I inner corner
I'm gonna take the brush and apply it on
the inner corner cuz my things my
fingers are too fat I love it this is
why I always do this look at events
because it's so freaking gorgeous I'm
obsessed so now I'm gonna go ahead and
do some eye liner my go-to eye liner
always is the Kat Von D trooper liner I
love the how easy it is to apply I love
that it stays on my eyes all day
it doesn't crease on me it doesn't crack
on me and it doesn't transfer on my
upper crease because I do have hooded
lids kind of so I'm just going to use
this as my wing going from the bottom of
the lash line outwards and then just
connecting it like so and then just
filling it in from there okay great so I
went in and I filled in my liner and I
applied my lashes that I always always
always wear at events this was like just
like my go-to ones and the style Bella
by new bounce um I use these all the
time they're so absolutely stunning
they're so Fleury so intense so I'm
going to be guys in to see what they
look like up close
so now we're done with the face I'm
gonna bond to the lips now one of my
go-to lip liners that I always use all
the time besides that next peekaboo
neutral is the stark-naked by urban
decay edge things is a really pretty
nice nude lip liner you guys know I love
my Nunes and so we're going just apply
this lip liner all over the lips this is
like one of my go-to lip liners I think
they're very nice very creamy very
pigmented
I love urban heat ones so once I'm lip
line and overdrawn like a
cholita from the body up I'm
going to apply the jeffree star
cosmetics manikin liquid lipstick this
has been my go-to lip for all events
this is literally my favorite claw
Jeffrey has ever done it's absolutely
perfection I cannot get over it I love
it so much
I wear it all the time I was actually
wearing this in the video with Jeffrey
going to the Q&amp;amp;A like we're asking what
if I was wearing its mannequin and this
is the final look
and that is it for the entire look I had
so much fun cream this look for you guys
