so it ABO is going to be my March 2015
favorites video all my beauty products
I've been living for in this past March
another 15 month this month I feel like
I have more stuff than I did last month
last month video was already long I love
it when you guys send me pictures of you
guys buying the products I recommended
you guys and you guys end up loving them
oh my god that's like my favorite thing
ever my biggest one last month I got the
most was probably the soap and glory
face wash you guys a bunch of you guys
bought the soap and glory face washing
gonna send me pictures of them and
tweeted them to me I was just so happy
you guys loved it and let me see super
happy cuz it's like oh my god you guys
are taking my hair recommendations and
you're putting them into your own life
and I live now this if you guys
likes kind of video don't watch
it you know that you're real open if you
duel go ahead and subscribe it ll
subscribe button it'll be somewhere well
it's going get started start with face
stuff have a tool let's do tools back to
tools this month that I've been living
for so first one is the morphe m500
brush I've been actually using this in a
couple tutorials recently and the more I
use it the more I end up loving it it's
this tapered fluffy brush doesn't really
use explain like this is what I know
that's a flavored up a flavored tough
feed is a tapered fluffy brush that
tapers to a point and it's extremely
fluffy like there's almost no denseness
to it at all but it's great at applying
blush and applying bronzer I think that
if you guys are not into a lot of
product on the face if you're into more
of a natural just come out dusting on
the face I would definitely try the
morphe a 500 and i have a code with
morphe i'll leave a link down below and
i'm green right here for 10% off so you
can save money on it they just release
this one so that's why i haven't really
talked about it yet but it's Bahama I
used it today and I've been using a lot
of it next one is the Black Beauty
Blender look how dirty this little
bitch's like wow you guys know what B
blender is you soak your little bitch in
water it expands to double its size and
you can use it to blend out and buff out
of your foundation can see there things
like that oh my god this Beauty blunder
like I don't know why I didn't jump on
the Beauty Blender
the Beauty Blender bandwagon wool that's
tongue twister I literally use it almost
every single time because I make them
not always like for applying foundation
but maybe is it like buff out like some
concealer buff out some contour things
like that I love the Beauty Blender at
the black links I feel like it doesn't
look as dirty is like the pink one does
so I like the black one more and I just
like black I wear black all the time he
doesn't know I wear black all the time
fact I'm wearing blue
was this a big deal popping you buddy
don't be bitter got that bitch so the
next one is going to be my make up
forevers step one skin equalisers this
one is the base nourishing I have all of
the makeup Forever's equalizers I've
been using them on call and kind of
periodically you see which I like the
best there's definitely one for every
type of skin type that you might need
each one applies a different skin needs
so for example this is the base
nourishing so if your skin isn't really
nourished and it needs a little bit more
protection this is a great one this is
the step one like the white one they
have like base mattifying they have base
smoothing they have radiance I swear the
step one equalizers oh my god
they are so so good they're so so good I
wish to her picker I wish those more
than this but I would definitely try
them out maybe you guys will find one
that will apply to you and you will love
it I know you guys well like this
is so thick thick my next item is gonna
be the Smashbox contouring stick if I
didn't get these in that make it forever
show box I don't know what I would've
done like these are so I mean what about
them I've been wearing them every single
time I do eye makeup I've been wearing
the Smashbox thinks they're amazing they
have like a highlight one a bronzy one a
contouring one they blend out so
effortlessly I kid you not they they
blend out like honestly like I think the
contour six are absolutely amazing and
yes they are totally worth of worth five
bucks they are so worth I should by the
way one of my followers told me like
like oh my god do not throw me the Bucks
because there's a sharpener inside the
box like when it comes with the sticks
my dumb ass decided to throw in the box
before checking it so please check your
box is it will have a sharpener in it
and now I'm a kata sharpener check them
out I think they're absolutely beautiful
the range is very very really good with
these ones you can use it from like even
if you're really really light all the
way to like medium medium dark
complexion you guys need is e so potent
about my next one oh my god oh my god
okay so the next item is the pro
sculpting duo from make it forever
oh my god okay let's be real I'm not
really the biggest fan of the bronzer
part because I feel like it's a little
bit too warm for me like it's pretty
warm even in the pan it's pretty warm
they probably give you think this is
globe to the skin like I find that 3
orange to me this was a very glowy kind
of bronzer so I'm not really into that
but be highlight this is just worth it
for the highlight alone I kid you not
like this highlight is everything I need
I'm wearing area now in cheek bones it
is so beautiful it just gives this
beautiful Sheen to the skin it is kind
of intense much more of a highlight that
is like you can see it from outer space
kind of highlight so keep that in mind
if you're more of a subtle like
hourglass ambient lighting kind of
highlight person this isn't for you but
it's for me cuz I love that thing
so next is the Laura Mercier translucent
setting powder my before I was telling
you guys how Tati and Patrick they were
both like oh my god you need to get the
translucent powder it is so good it is
amazing and it gives you this beautiful
finish this skin and I was like you know
what okay I'll buy you know $35 so I
ended buying the powder and I am so in
love with this powder it keeps you matte
dope today it gives you a nice
airbrushed finish I'm wearing it right
now on top of my foundation and I feel
like makes my makeup look so pretty I
thought it just looks really smooth and
just it looks really nice and said you
get so much product in here you do get
26 in court Wednesday well you do get 29
grams of product in here and it's all
good and it doesn't reflect back I love
the fact that it does not reflect back
in your photo maava Han last face item
is the Kat Von D shade and light palette
this is what it looks like six colors
three contouring shades and three
highlighting shades ranging from warm to
cool tones this is just an amazing
palette everyone's talking about this
palette and it's so worth the money it
is absolutely beautiful I give you a the
same diffuse softer glow to the skin and
I'm using it on my cheeks today over my
Smashbox contour six and I feel like it
really just helps give me that contoured
look and it looks really pretty I just
think this is a really great pile of the
way these blend in I love the color
selection of these ones and I know it's
like on the pricier so I know things but
it's so worth it it's absolutely amazing
and I live I live so I have one eye item
that I've been living for this month and
it is the roller lash mascara by benefit
just
slay me throw me in the river dead love
it so the reason I love this mascara so
much is because it really I feel like
using me so much link to my lashes and
it doesn't give me that much fullness
but it does give me a lot of length and
definition to the lash and I love my
stare as I do that for me especially for
me because I wear falsies like all the
time so I like it when my real lashes
blend into the falsies very very very
easily as well as this is a great
mascara for the bottom lash line because
it has that small curved applicator that
plastic grooved applicator which are
great at getting in between
and the packaging like it's pink and it
feels like suede I love that stop okay
we have lip products now come I got lip
products I feel like the lip products I
have the most of because I'm a
lip junkie okay first it's going to talk
about my Gerard obsessions for this
month oh my god so the two lipsticks
from Gerard have been living for from
Gerard cosmetics are the kimchi doll I'm
very smoothie I've talked about these
how much I'm already kimchi dah I've
been wearing religiously so I'm gonna go
ahead swatch them nice to me don't hand
me on my big ass man hands that you know
so this is what they look like tres
amigas in okay well so that's what they
look like I think they're beautiful the
computer is a very light light light
peachy pink color that gives a beautiful
satin finish and very smoothie is a very
warm rose I think they're absolute aful
they both have the same finish a satin
pretty finish could you know again you
guys should definitely wear with a lip
liner because it's so like as you can
see it's almost blending in with my own
skin tone but it is so light without it
I think that you need a lip liner with
kimchi taupe and I also have codes with
drawers and stuff like that I'll leave
everything listed down below in my
description bar for some code that
like that
oh thanks okay cool so I'm really really
excited to talk about these because I
feel like I get clocked all the time for
not talking about more drugstore items
so these are the NYX soft matte lip
creams the two colors I'm obsessed with
are Istanbul and Stockholm these creams
are so nice I use this for the first
time in my one brand tutorial of NYX
Cosmetics
I used a symbol for the first time and
it was so nice it felt so good the smell
of them it's like like the factory must
have been in heaven and just we were
gifted on this earth with these it's not
like cake batter and like frosting it's
just it's a beautiful smell so Istanbul
is a light soft pink color and Stockholm
is a peachy beige nude color both are
absolutely beautiful me so much Emily
yeah they go on like a cream and they
dry to a matte finish but they're not
drying whatsoever they're so cool okay
so this is what they look like
this is Eastern booty and this is
Stockholm so what they look like it has
this one is a nice soft pink and this is
a nice new big ish they just feel so
great on the lips they smell beautiful
and they're just they're sickening I
love them and they're $5 like
really you can't beat $5 drumroll you
can't
okay so the next two items I have are
the new Anasazi glasses I don't know why
I had to go into like sexy look mode but
they're bomb the two colors I have our
dainty and vintage they're both news I'm
sorry I like you guys think I love nude
coast I feel like they look the best on
me personally I tried really hard to you
do more about deep lip today because a
lot of you guys are like you should do
deep lips more and I'm like looks like
Dean and you take it out and it has like
a nice flat paddle applicator it's like
this is filet these glasses are so
 pigmented it makes me think
like I die and they also they some are
almost identical to that next matte lip
creams that's the cool thing about they
both smell like cake frosting and cake
batter so this is dainty it's a soft
muted pink with a little bit of beige to
it it's so beautiful and then I have
vintage which is more of a universal
color for more different people show you
this one doesn't look like which is like
a deep plum a pink they're so pigmented
they go full pigment on the lips they
are not sticky whatsoever they don't
feel heavy I think these glasses are
absolutely amazing they did so good with
these and they're only 16 but it's like
that's like the price of a Mac one but
these are way better than Mac ones like
in my opinion no tea no shade after you
have all of the Anasazi lip glosses so I
got interested I can always make a video
separately on them in detail of
different colors that I love or just a
couple swatches of the colors I'm just
do a deep more in-depth review of them I
can doubly do that for you guys if you
guys are interested asleep in comment
down below and I will get to that
if you want well last but not least it's
actually the color of lipstick I am
wearing right now which is the Geoffrey
start unicorn blood lipstick for some
reason whenever I hear unicorn blood I'm
gonna like see it and a weird accent
unicorn blood like is that is that just
me like I feel like that word just like
it makes me want to be like Voldemort
ish you know this is a very deep
burgundy brown and the reason that looks
a little bit more red on my lips is
because I actually use like a more
reddish tone lip liner with it let me go
and show you what a swash is like on my
hand so it looks like on my hand is a
deep burgundy brown color I'm seriously
loving the jeffree star lipsticks
they're liquid lipsticks that's right
2:8 matte finish this is the thing
though some of them are nice pigmented
as the others so it's kind of weird I
feel like the deeper colors are more
pigmented than the lighter colors that
he has or that his line has so I have
all the lipsticks now I just got the
black one so I and I love love the black
one I don't think I've ever won black
lipstick on my channel before but I
think it's so beautiful it's like a
matte black lipstick it looks sick I
think unicorn blood is absolutely
beautiful it's not really much of a
spring/summer color but for those of you
who live like Australia or across the
world for me this is all I think the
packaging is also beautiful as well when
you open
thing and it has like a little click to
it did you hear that it makes me so
happy the click makes me so I don't know
what it is I my inner OCD it's very
happy when I hear that go click noise
like it's really sealed if you're more
interested in the in-depth review of
those I can definitely do that as well
and you like some swatches of them if
you're interested so leave that down
below if you are interested in some
jeffree star liquid lip these swatches
