the highways someone shadowed through
the sunrays and
hey turn that shit back on hey guys
welcome back to my channel so today
there's going to be my melt lipstick
collection kind of swatch video and
review of a limit lipsticks I'm wearing
only glass right now because my lips are
so beyond fuck basically i swatched
eleven colors I thought I had more than
eleven because I got some of the famous
bow but it turns out I only have 11 so
I'm gonna keep collecting the limit
lipsticks until I have them all how much
I have as many as I possibly can because
I love them lf6 I love the formula and I
love their brand I feel like they're
such a cool online indie brand that has
been getting so much recognition for
good reason their quality of their
lipsticks are it's absolutely amazing I
absolutely love them so much you guys

would really really appreciate it so
much
please don't lash it let's go and get
into the little review okay let's get
this little bit started when Anton me
what's that from why is that from and
she's a fellow youtuber she's like let's
get Bernie she's so cute if you guys
know it is you better find common
actually who that is so this is a Mel
packaging it's a nice matte black
packaging like a little purple milk
looks like bean this is decaf take a
blue so each lipstick comes with 3.2
grams of product that's super standard
for a lipstick that's like totally
normal every lipstick is matte some of
the lipsticks are more matte than others
some of them were like hard to put on
because they were so mattifying I was
like huh like it was like swiping at my
lip and I was kind of hurting that
wasn't like that big of a deal but some
of them are super creamy matte like they
feel amazing on the lips and they're
matte and they lasted all day cuz I've
worn a couple of them already
I love melt as a brand I think they're
such a great awesome brand their
lipsticks are expensive I think they're
like definitely upwards of like low 20s
and upper $19 I'm not really sure how
much they are yes I think that they're a
great brand I think the products are
absolutely amazing trust me they're not
pay me to talk about this they don't

want to do it for you guys because you

good like they have like almost no pick
up whatsoever the pigmentation is so
good and they blend like amazingly I
think I've had the chance to like play
