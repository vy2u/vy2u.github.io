feel like I'm robbing a bank
this beanie on right now okay y'all
black beanie calm down there's a little
bit's from time to some cute moment in
there but hi guys welcome back to my
channel so what today's video is going
to be my most disappointing products of
2016 when it comes to the beauty world I
decided to wear like my blue contacts
first because you know like I feel like
I look a little bitch here and like a
little more like cutthroat when I have
these in I feel very like um Selene from
underworld you know very like quick kill
I'm not gonna tell it the worst of
beauty because it's not the worst of
beauty these products are not the worst
things ever but they're just products
that were disappointed in in 2016 and
just because this is on my disappointing
product list does not mean that if you
love it it does not mean it's good you
know to me like if it works for you and
you loved it I'm so happy it did because
you spent your money on a product and it
worked for you and that makes me so
happy to hear like I had so many people
requesting me to do the worst of beauty
and like I know it's coming at you a
little bit late and like halfway through
January I'm apologize for that I'm Jen
explained to you and like a brief detail
why I don't like the products I'm not
gonna go like intense detail
hate trade for a product I've never been
like that the idea that it makes me like
like it makes me feel really weird I
don't like to hate on any products you
know I just think that Oh brand works so
hard like I don't know I just like I see
like the other end it's like brands
works so hard to create this product and
they think that it's really good you
like they think that it's an awesome
product and that they worked really hard
to create this thing and there's the
other end where it's like they didn't
work that hard to create and they 22 if
I can make money which and that's the
case for some of these products shame on
you brands that's annoying and
that's really rude but I don't know I
never really like to talk bad about
products because a lot of time the
brands do work really really hard to
create these products this is just me
explaining why a product didn't work for
me and if it works for you awesome but
yeah as always if you guys want this
video to guys don't like me please don't
 watch you know the drill with
that you know the drill you know the
drill genie in a bottle baby come come
come any me mmm that's why I'm not the
right word isn't but if you guys do eggs
video please like it and subscribe to my
channel if you aren't already and if
you're new what's up I'm Manning anyway
and welcome to my channel thank you so
much for being here
um but yeah that's going to get into
this disappointing product of 2016
okay guys let's get into this video the
first things first
I'm grabbing that I was disappointed
with is the Kylie cosmetics holiday 2016
palette I loved that they had mirror
talk me wrong I love that I had a mirror
I'm very very happy about that but the
reason I did not like the product itself
is because the color scheme is not what
I like so you have like what you have
your 1 2 3 4 formats right if formats
that aren't very pigmented they're like
they're pretty pigmented but they're not
that pigmented the only one that is
actually like really great in this
palette is the silver this one I live
for I'm like oh that's a nice silver
that works nicely you're gonna get
this palette just for the silver if you
want but the palette itself is just not
that good like the shadows are kind of
powdery they're like kind of chalky when
you try to blend them out they take a
little while to blend out I love the
burgundy palette like the burgundy
palette is what I use often and I did a
video on it before and I said it worked
great and I really really liked it but
this one didn't work the same as a
Brittany palette which is why I'm like
why not though yeah never using that
never using that again so hurry if I
almost a story after every single part I
talk about because I just feel bad
whatever I don't care
next product that I didn't really like
and I was disappointed with and the
reason I'm calling this is disappointing
products by the way is because I was
hyped about this product or like I was
excited to try it out and when I tried
it I was like oh like I was kind of
letdown and that's why I'm calling it
the disappointed products because I had
an expectation and it wasn't met so
that's why I'm calling this a
disappointing products video the next
one is going to be the UH Nastasia
Beverly Hills glow kit child child child
like this was just not very good man it
just was not good the colors themselves
are very like flaky so ridiculously
powdery and they're not pigmented enough
like you would think that for something
so powdery it would be more pigmented
but it's that looks painted on camera
because the lights make it look
intensely reflective but it's not like
on a brush like it doesn't like come up
it's just like I don't know they're also
very chunky very glittery and I'm just
like like it's just not the best form of
highlighters to me glow kits that she
has like the other ones are bomb
so I'm like how in the world did this
one come out of them when their other
glow kids that they had were so great it
doesn't feel as good it doesn't feel as
luxurious it doesn't feel as nice it
doesn't reflect like the way the
other ones doing doesn't blend the way
the other ones do so I'm just like like
I was disappointed with it when I opened
it and I'm like homie I just didn't work
for me I guess like if it works for you
awesome for me it was like no go let's
talk about another product I just did
not like when it comes to the
highlighting realm this is the Urban
Decay Naked illuminating trio this is
another product that I was just so
bummed about
I tried their other baked powders and
they were really really nice but this
one like literally like nothing comes
off it's like the weirdest thing I'm
like there's nothing on here what the
book that middle one is like literally
chunky glitter but not my cute chunky
glitter where it's like Mac reflects
glitter this was just a major miss about
another little palette so this palette
is from Kat Von D this is the Kat Von D
shade + light eye palette this is a
little quad this is what I have this is
in the shade smoke honestly honestly
like why like honestly like honestly why
like what was the point of this little
nugget like it just doesn't like I don't
know like the shadows Kat Von D shadows
are notoriously great you know she has
like the shade + light eye palette which
is so phenomenal so I don't
really understand why they came out with
like this little minis little mini quads
I just like the color schemes for all of
them weren't very good and it's like I
have all these shades and different
palettes but like what's a point this
little mini foursome like I don't I
don't know say these four colors like
what is this like is this your cool tone
trend the shadows are nice that I'm not
gonna lie it's like a cool tone
transition a white like I was baffled
truly when I was baffled I opened this
and I was like dude this kind of like is
not great when I open this I saw that
this was the quad and this is the color
scheme I'm like you know it's just like
a little quiver and a lip like I was one
of those moments so don't like the Kat
Von D quad what about one more
highlighting product that was not up to
par for me um but I'm sure I could work
on other people it just what for me
personally it just didn't work this is
the cover effects sunlight highlighter
um it's a very very very very subtle
kind of sheen basically a large satin
shadow like if I wanted to like I use it
as my eye shadow it would be great I
like on my lid it would look fantastic
but as a face highlighter I was like
this is just a Miss
me because they're covered drops were so
 bomb and so metallic and so
intense and so reflective and I was like
ah I was expecting that when I got these
in the mail and I got so excited think
I'm gonna get reflective powders and
super super cool exciting things it
wasn't that it was a very just subtle
soft like glow from within and I'm not
into glow from within if you're into
glow from within glow from within right
here but I'm not into that like I'm not
into like that really like pretty
hourglass like soft like you know I want
like I want that I want this at all
times so this just didn't give it to me
but if you guys are interested in nice
soft light powder check out the cover FX
one because it is nice for those of you
who don't like really intensely
reflective things but want a nice subtle
glow this would be actually real good
for you guys oh my god you guys are
gonna your pants when I
bring this coming out you guys are gonna
 your tits when I bring this
palette out you guys are gonna be like
no no man II don't do this s it kind of
pains me to have this in my video
because I was so so excited about this
palette like the way this looks the way
this acts like honestly - amazing Kat
Von D the concept of this palette is so
 revolutionary I was like oh my
god but that meant that the hype was so
built for me and I was so so so excited
and it didn't perform the way I wanted
to which is why it's in my disappointing
products video so honestly the shadows
themselves they're good they're not bad
shadows at all it's the color scheme
that I cannot work with this is the
color scheme of the palette so that red
is beautiful and it looks very very nice
and the black is nice but honestly these
other colors I'm like how do you make a
fool look with this like a nice blended
out full look how do you do at this side
and how do you even do it with this side
where it's a transition shade where's
the light soft Browns where's the light
soft even a cool tone brown like
would be nice nothing in here for that
what I put in my crease nothing there's
nothing to put in there like I can't put
any soft create this palette doesn't
make sense to me the color scheme does
not make sense I will not use this path
like literally ever unless I'm going in
for one shade and that is it I don't
what if I can think that come on I don't
want to go in for one shade so I'll talk
about some complexion products really
quickly cuz already in my hand I
wanted to like it I really really really
did this is the makeup forever water
blend foundation honestly this reminds
me of like coloured water literally
colored water me
put a little pump on the back of my hand
this isn't my color obviously but
there's someone I could find
this looks like it's literally water and
a little bit of a tin of a color which
is fine and if you're like that Thai
person that is one where any makeup is
beautiful I'm sure you would love it but
for me it's like this is a no
like this is a no-go I'm a full-coverage
Queen so I'm like honestly no I'm so
that I do like this concealer and go
that I don't want to put it in but I
should I don't want to but I should this
is the Born This Way concealer by Too
Faced I know you guys probably thinking
like if you guys love it you're obably
taking like what the okay so this
concealer people love it they
love it they're obsessed with it they
think it's literally everything and I'm
so happy you do for me bring them a full
coverage Queen and love full coverage
concealers and love concealers I don't
crease easily on me this was not that I
wanted the coverage to be a little bit
higher I wanted it to crease less on me
I didn't want to look as heavy as it did
I'm like if a concealers gonna look
heavy underneath my eyes the net should
better be full coverage as but this
wasn't and I was like but you looked
have you underneath my eyes but okay
while you look at minimize I've worn it
one time and it didn't work I mean so
I'm like I'm never gonna wear this again
that was so an accident honestly like I
was not being a diva like that was an
accident
that was an accident it just wasn't what
I like what did I am you know number one
worst lip product f3 number one worse
the products I really did not like were
the colour-pop ultra metallic lipsticks
oh they were wrong honestly like
I also really do not like the ultra
matte lipsticks from colour-pop I think
they're both very very drying some of
them are really really patchy like they
flake on me a lot too this one was like
oh my god hell on my lips it was just
not good next product I was disappointed
in are the lip tars by OCC back swear on
OCC they used to have like these little
tubes or like a tube of it lipstick and
it'll be like you need like a little
brush and you apply it they came out
with a big form which is so quite like
that they changed up the component I
like that they use a little wand and
they have a little thing and it's like
full-blown but the thing I don't like
about it the feathering of these
lipsticks you guys if you guys have ever
worn OCC lip tar you guys will know that
you have to use a lip liner with it or
it will literally bleed everywhere it
will let go all of your lips will end up
on your chin your nose like
it'll end up everywhere and it's so
annoying cause they're so pigmented look
at that swatch
they're so ultra pigmented and they're
like honestly one of the first liquid
lipsticks that ever came out but I feel
like they need to switch up the formula
a little bit have a nice melt away
smells like kind of cucumber and
peppermint it's like weird I was super
super bummed that I didn't like these I
thought that when they came out with the
new packaging this the actual product
was gonna be different it was gonna like
not feather and not like get everywhere
and not be crazy but it wasn't and it
was the same and I was like I can't
wear these man like I don't want to wear
these you know what I mean so I was like
I'm sad I'm sad about that and last but
not least the last lip product that I
literally did not like in 2016 is this
by Terry Rouge expert click stick okay
guys when I got these in the mail I had
like literally like a billion there came
with like so many come on again
with so many and when i swatched i was
like i was blown away with how
beautifully pigmented they were like i
was like oh my look at that i was like
holy holy this is beautiful
like I was literally living for and I
was like oh my god I cannot wait for
this on I smelled it I was like smells
like roses like that's kind of weird but
whatever I glue it off because I don't
mind a rose scent I don't mind it I'm
like I'm always like oh that's cute like
a rose scent is nice it's rosing it's
cute but when I put this on my lips I
had to take off and like within three
minutes like the Rose scent like oh my
god I had a headache
I had a headache start the day
from this just from wearing this for
like three minutes I had a headache and
I was like dude this is crazy this never
had me I'm not sensitive to smells but
this Rose scent lipstick it is so
strong I was so like sad because they're
so pigmented and creamy and I was like
I'm gonna love these I'm gonna
leave it for them but when I put it on I
couldn't even wear it because it smells
so bad
I'm like don't even put a set in here
I'm gonna make a smell like that intense
and that like bang nobody saying
please just don't you just never
know and you guys that's it for the
entire most dissapointing products 2016
for me there's definitely more products
have happened I just can't find them or
whatever I didn't see them or like I
blocked them out of my memory for
obvious reasons they just didn't work
for me but again as I said earlier if
they worked for you I'm so happy they
did because you spent your money on them
and I'm so grateful that they have
worked on you and you weren't like just
spending money to spend your money and
just like throw it away basically cuz
the products up so I'm very happy works
for you and you got what you wanted from
the product and it just didn't work for
me for some reasons for my skin type or
what I like or whatever it may be it
just didn't work but um yeah thank you

disappointing products videos I don't
ever really do this because it makes me
nervous I just I'm like no I don't I
can't do it but I feel like I was very
respectful towards the brand's and like
just because I found one thing that I
don't like about them does not mean that
they have so many products that I
 love from them because all the
brand's I talked about do all the brands
I do I just this product it didn't work
for me for some reason it just didn't so
yeah that's it for this entire video
