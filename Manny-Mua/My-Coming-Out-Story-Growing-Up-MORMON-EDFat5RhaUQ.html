emu and welcome to my channel like I
said earlier but yeah it's going into
this coming out video
okay great so where do you even start
off doing a my coming-out journey video
so let me just start off by saying this
I grew up Mormon I grew up LDS for those
of you don't know what that is that is a
sect in the Christian Church lines it's
very very very very similar to the
concept of Christianity so that's just a
back story I grew up Mormon my whole
entire family is Mormon my entire mom's
side of the family is Mormon my dad's
side not so much um but I grew up in
church went to church every single
Sunday I went to every name in the book
to do with church I did family home
evening I went to seminary before high
school I did everything I was a just
good boy I was a good Mormon boy and I
just grew up that way my entire life so
I am the firstborn of my family is my
mom and my dad and it's me and my two
little brothers I am the oldest and yeah
I was born first I'm four years older
than Nick and Nick is four years older
than Aaron so I was the firstborn child
and I was just you know I came out to
him strong I was like what's that about
here in this world so me going up I was
basically the baby I was the firstborn
in my entire family I am the oldest
cousin it was me only so I was basically
a people-pleaser child I always liked
making people happy that was all I cared
about when I was younger all I would do
is make my mom and my dad happy with
anything with sports with school I was a
straight-a student I played sports in
high school I was a good kid looking
back on it the reason why I was so
people pleaser craziest because I always
knew something about me was different so
back then when I was like five or six
years old I know what it was having no I
had no idea I didn't know why I felt
different I don't know why I didn't like
to play with the boys at recess I just
liked to play with the girls and I was
just kind of what it was I liked play
with girls more than boys and I never
really understood why that was and why I
wasn't really seen as normal for me to
play with the girls instead of the boys
this is kind of a preface to me coming
out just letting you guys know I know
it's kind of long it's like long-winded
I apologize but yes so growing up fast
track to growing up I'm in junior high
now and I start to really realize that I
am definitely more on the different side
compared to the other boys that are in
school I did not like to do with the
same things they did but yet I was very
much attracted to what they were doing
in a weird way I was very much just like
okay what's going on like I'm like
attracted to these kids like
what it's going huh I was talking to
these kids and I really started to
realize as I got into junior high slash
at the beginning of high school that I
did like boys and me growing up Mormon
very very very sheltered in my household
very much in the church like in the
church um was so scared I was terrified
to death of the concept of me liking a
boy I just like knew I couldn't do it
because my family it was a no-no for my
family and Rossano know for the church
so I was like there's no way in hell I'm
going to like boys so basically every
single night I would pray to please not
like boys because that was just what I
was doing and I know it sounds kind of
like sad but that's just what it was I
would literally just cry loudly being
been crying too please just not like
boys because I was so scared of what
could possibly happen if you guys don't
know this that the Mormon Church is not
really for the gays and so um I was very
very terrified and I just didn't want it
to happen and I just wanted to be normal
or what I thought it was normal back
then so basically I would literally try
to pray the gay away and I know it just
sounds crazy but what I did I would try
my hardest to pray the gay way I would
just try my hardest to not really feel
those feelings basically I would try to
shelter myself as much as I could to not
feel those things and that's what it was
for years so a fast tracked to MySpace
stays I had a myspace when I was younger
I was about like what maybe 16 head of
MySpace I mean everyone out of my space
when they were 16 that's just what it
was you know what I mean and I really
had it for mainly my friends for having
my top eight you know what I'm saying I
just had it just just to communicate
with my friends and that's just kind of
what it was I just had a myspace for
that reason and that was it but somehow
I was gaining popularity on MySpace I
always had a lot of friends on MySpace
so one day this boy named we're gonna
call him tea because I don't want to say
any names in this video
his name is tea he messaged me one day
and we were just chatting and chit
chatting because I just thought he was
cool he seemed like a cool guy this is
when I was around 16 17 years old I
think we're just kind of chatting
talking back and forth and in my mind I
was thinking wow this dude is a really
attractive handsome guy but I wasn't
really thinking much of it and the more
and more I talked to him the more and
more I was kind of attracted to him or
more I just felt more pool and I was
like what's going on why am I feeling so
 attracted this dude I knew
because it was me deep down wanting to
explore this world that this kid is in
because this kid on his profile said
that he was bisexual and I was like
what the is my thanks what like I
was so sheltered I no idea what I was
but I looked it up and I figured out
that it was liking boys and liking girls
so this kid was talking to me he's
chatting with me and I was very very
very very inquisitive so one day I was
chatting with him and I was in my living
room and I was chatting on my laptop and
I was like asking him questions about
boys and I was like hey so like what's
it like to kiss a boy I was asked like
really those kind of questions where
it's like weird saying this straight kid
like as me you know what I mean like in
the world of that I am as a straight kid
growing up in the church asking these
questions like hey what's like to kiss a
boy was it weird for you like what's
like how is it being bisexual I was very
curious about his life because deep down
I wanted I wanted to know what it was
like because that's what I was learning
for so basically after that after we're
done chatting this is during the day and
this is when I was about 17 years old
we're done chatting and I closed my
laptop and I left the living room so
yeah skinning its gonna get it so then I
go get something I don't know what I go
to get but I was gone from like for
about ten minutes from the living room
with my laptop in the living room so I
come back and my mom and my dad are
there my mom's crying they're sitting on
the table with my laptop open and
they're my mom's crying and my dad has a
really really intense stern look on his
face and I was like what the like I
was for my heart was tore in
half I didn't know what was going on I
was so so nervous I didn't know what was
going on so I'm like hey guys it's like
what's up like so confused so confused
and my mom's just crying and my dad's
just sitting there and blatantly like
right out there like who's T what so
apparently they had read all the
messages from me and this boy and
they're like what are you doing why are
you talking to this kid like this why
are you flirting with him and I'm like
I'm not flirting out a way talking about
I have no idea what you're saying I'm
not flirting at all and they're like man
yo you're flirting you can tell on these
messages you're asking him about kissing
boys what is up with that what's what's
going on and I just break down
and I'm sobbing I'm sobbing my
eyes out I'm freaking out I'm 17 years
old this kid who grew up as being
perfect I was honestly a perfect
child like really I was straight A's
like that was a
I was like a dream for a parent I was I
was well behaved I never drank never
smoked I never did drugs nothing I was
so good so over here my heart's
crumbling because I am I'm failing my
parents cuz they're upset with me and
I'm like oh my god what the do I do
with the I do and I was freaking
out so I just break down and they ask me
like do you like boys and I was like so
I'm freaking out here and I just break
down and I said yes I did
I do I like boys and I don't know why
and they're both crying I'm crying it's
just a sobbing mess because another
backstory my parents had me when they
are 18 and 19 years old so they are very
young I'm 25 mind you so they are very
very very young they grew up did not
know one single gay person and did not
know one they were so sheltered they
thought it was a choice so that's just
another backtrack so back to present and
they're like do you want help like what
do we do about this like I don't I don't
know what to do
honest to god they thought being gay was
a choice they had no idea that wasn't
something that I chose it was something
that I was born with and I was born this
way again their whole into her life they
were taught and raised thinking that gay
Bing gay was a choice so they asked me
when I'm 17 to like do you want help
like what what's going on like do we do
want to get help with this do you want
to change do you want to become straight
basically so I say yes and I'm like
please I would love to I want to be
normal so then I start going to
counseling and this is not like the
normal average counseling this is the
anti-gay counseling when I'm 17 years
old I would go every single Monday after
school none of my friends and you at all
no one in my family knew no one knew at
all because I was going to counseling to
try to reverse the effects of being gay
basically honestly it sounds crazy but
that's what I was doing when I was 17 um
and after about six months of going to
counseling didn't it wasn't working I
knew the entire time that I wasn't
working it was just such a I just knew
it wasn't working like obviously it
wasn't it wasn't working and I started
to get depressed and depressed and more
depressed and about six months in I was
in like a real real depression like I
was actually depressed so my mom and my
dad sent me
they're like what is wrong with you like
what is going on in your head why are
you why are you acting like your normal
self like your normal happy self because
I was happy kid you know so um they're
asking me what is wrong why is wrong
again I break down and I told him I the
counselling isn't working I'm not
changing nothing this person is telling
me is working at all I'm not gonna not
be gay
I still like boys I told him I was like
I still like boys I can't help it so my
parents being the loving parents that
they are so they tell me okay cool so
let's take a pause on this counselling
and let's just see how things go
we want you to be happy basically what
they told me we just want you to be
happy we want you to know that we love
you and we're trying to do the best we
can with the knowledge that we have so
that's why we've insisted on counselling
so I hundreds understood where they're
coming from
being that they were so young of their
first child growing up in the church
it's just a lot for them to handle so
I'm like okay cool so what do I do what
what what step now what where do we go
from this so I basically after the six
months I stopped going to counseling
completely the counseling that never
 worked time started to pass more
and more and more every month it just
got easier and easier and easier
so I'm now fast track to I stopped going
to counsel him about eighteen years old
about to get into college and I was
angry I was upset I was upset with how
things were going you know things
weren't changing I was resentful and at
this point I was like you know what
it I'm gay I'm here I'm queer
and I'm gonna act on it so I decided to
be a little I'm just gonna
I start to get much more liberal and a
much more like you know what it didn't
work the counseling did not work on me
so you want to I'm gonna do I'm a
doer wanna do so I'm starting to get
much more rebellious that's kind of what
I was that's the word I was going for
I'll try to get more rebellious because
I was just seeing it as like you know
what it dude I'm gonna do whatever
the hell I want you know what I mean so
I got my tongue pierced and then I
started to experiment more and see who I
really was I might not be making
everyone around
be happy but I'm gonna be making myself
happy because my whole life I was just
making other people happy and I was over
it so somewhere going into college I
kissed a boy for the first time and it
was great
the greatest experience so what happened
was there was this kid that his name
starts with a c haha I don't want to say
any names business received and he
really close friends with one of my best
friends in high school and he would come
by and watch my volleyball games with
her it was just a cool guy who I knew I
knew was gay I thought it was really
really cool because he was out in high
school I was in twelfth grade and he was
in tenth grade so he was a lot younger
than me but I was like I still looked at
him a lot when I was in high school
because he was out and he just didn't
give a about what the people
thought so I really liked that so um I
had heard through the grapevine that he
had thought I was cute one day and I
just started to chat with him so we were
just texting more and more frequently
and I started to really acquire feelings
the first time I ever got feelings for
anyone anyone in my entire life like
actual real feelings not only connected
on a mental and emotional level but on a
like physical level I was actually
attracted to this person and I was
wanting to do things with them not like
things not like sexual things but sexual
thing so one day my friend was driving
me and him home and we were all just
kinda hanging out and I was in the front
seat and he was in the back seat and we
were just driving and she stopped to get
gas and he was I come back here just
ride with me I don't want to be back
here alone and I was like okay you're so
weird but I'll do it he puts his hand on
my leg and I like but I was I
was pounding like I was going to
die I didn't know what to do and I was
freaking out like first experience with
the boy to know was going on he put his
hand on my leg and I like I looked over
him and he like looked over at me and he
kissed me and we kind of made up for
like a couple seconds in like 10 seconds
I was so like I was like I was like a
weight off my chest I came off like it
was like earth-shattering experience
basically it just it sounds
crazy and I saw it's traumatic as
but it really was it was so like I
opening it I was like oh my god this
feels right and this feels like what's
meant to be we drive back to her house
and he leaves and I left and I'm left
back with her and I'm like freaking out
I'm like oh my gonna be kissing the bike
are we kissing back and see all
freaking out like him I'm bi I came out
as bi first I didn't come out as gay to
my friends I said I was bi and she was
like oh my god that's crazy like
congratulations she was just really
happy for me so then I asked her Tomac
hey can we make out because I've never
made out with someone before so I asked
her if we can make out so I made out
with her right after because I was like
I need to know if I was glad or not so
she was like you did great that was my
first ever gay boy experience and it
felt so right and I just felt like this
was what I wanted this is this has been
what I was wanting for my whole entire
life
sadly me and him never worked out we
became great friends I'm so friends with
him to this day he was looking for
something more at the time and I was so
newbie and I just couldn't really give
my all because I was so scared and I
didn't know what I was going through at
the time because he was like would you
ever experiment and do more than just
kiss and I was like I don't know
I'm confused
so it work out at the time but it's
funny cuz I actually end up like liking
him for years after like it's just funny
cuz he was like the first guy I ever
liked present ever kiss in the future if
he's single and we meet in different in
a different setting like I would totally
date him in like a second cuz
he's such a cool guy that's kind of how
it was so when I get to 19 years old I
start to get a little bit more
rebellious I stopped going to church and
I'm not saying that I don't believe in
the church at all I have my own beliefs
and that's just what it is I just
stopped going physically because I just
didn't want to be there I felt like I
was being judged all the time it's kind
of hard for me to conceal being gay I'm
I'm not saying I'm super flamboyant all
the time especially when I'm not wearing
makeup I'm much more of a chill side but
people just knew it's like I have the
gate voice people just knew I was gay
so I stopped going to church my family's
of those all the time and fast forward I
started working at a restaurant in
Hillcrest which is in the gay area of
San Diego and I started to really branch
out and come into my own in the gay
world as I was getting into college as
well because as soon as I hit college
man I was just so over people telling me
what to do and just making other people
happy I was so just trying to make
myself happy once I hit college and I
was like you know what I'm gonna do me
and honestly like I had the support from
my parents so that's all that really
mattered to me you know they loved me
and they supported me and they just
wanted me to be happy and they knew I
was happy because I had found myself and
so honestly I'm so lucky to have them in
my life and I know it was a struggle in
the beginning a lot of Tears a lot of
heartbreak a lot of confusion but we we
got through it I got very lucky with
I have they didn't kick me out they were
confused just like I was and they kind
of grew up with me honestly that's kind
of how it was I had a really tough time
when I was not growing up because I had
an amazing life I have an amazing
amazing amazing life and amazing family
but I had a tough time internally
growing up that's kind of what I mean I
had so much energy conversion and I just
hated so many different aspects of
myself which in turn made me sometimes
lash out and looking back I know it's
because I just wanted to be normal this
video is going out to all those who feel
like they're different any aspect of
your life that's different or seen as
different in society's norms you will
get through it I promise you like I know
people say that it gets better all the
time
but truly time does heal all wounds and
I hope you guys can take that from this
video that had a really hard time in the
beginning and I definitely had my
struggles hardcore but me and my family
got through it and I'd want you guys to
know that you guys will get through it
as well whatever kind of struggles you
guys are going through um I hope you
guys enjoy this video it's probably a
 long one if you guys have any
other questions about this video about
anything else please let me know in the
comments bar below because I am still
kind just like running around here like
I don't have anything written down I had
to write anything down this just kind of
going off my memory so if you guys have
any questions that I didn't hit in the
video talking I will definitely be
lurking the comments down below just to
comment back because I do want to
definitely be there for you guys if you

different video um or my family reacting
to that whatever it is let me know in
the comments bar below and I'll

to create more of these videos for you

being here with me and for just loving
me and loving Who I am as a person
because first of all I didn't love why
was as a person and I do now and it's
just so crazy because I never thought I
would get to this point ever in my whole
life
especially growing up because I didn't
accept myself for four years
years and years and now accepting myself
what and who I am and having millions of
people backing me is just so crazy and
it's absolutely amazing it's the best
feeling in the world and I hope you guys
can feel that with yourselves and if
you're struggling with yourself I
promise you that if you guys try and
make an effort for yourself don't give
up on yourself you know do not give up
on yourself at all that's really really
really important I know times get hard
and things get very very tough in life
gets so hectic sometimes but you really
need to work on yourself at all times
and never feel like you're not good
enough because you are good enough I
promise you you're good enough and
what anyone else has to say about you
took me a long long time to realize that
message and it took me a long time to
start loving myself so hope you guys

really do but yeah other than that okay
