name is Mandy MUA um no I can't do that
I can't do that I cannot do those kind
of intros I just look I just feel so
weird but you know if you all like do
those intros like hey guys it's
something like I can't do that I don't
know what it is I just can't like my
body just doesn't want to do that start
again
hey guys welcome back to my channel so
today's video is going to be my favorite
morphe brushes part 2 I have one video
already up it is my favorite morphe
brushes it's like my top picks I use
morphe in literally every single video
that I'm doing makeup because they are
my favorite brand I'm gonna fill you
with them they're just third great
people and I absolutely love them and I
think that the quality is outstanding
for the price the price is there the
quality is there I've rings on my rings
on these are add-ons from my last video
I will leave my last video down below
the brushes in the last video are
absolutely amazing and I totally
recommend those brushes as well
obviously and I'm not going to be doing
any repeats in this video because these
are like my second or after like the
flawless collection launched and after
the elite collection launched so this is
gonna be a separate video from that one
as always if you like this video if you
guys do like me please please don't
 watch it cause I'm gonna fun but
you guys do what you guys do like this
video and you guys do let me please like
this video and subscribe to my channel
if you're not already let's go and stop
with Facebook's first I chose 5 face
brushes to go with first I probably say
this a lot but these are again add-ons
to my last video but I like these face
ones so much as well as other ones of
course but these are the ones that are
continued dye for wealthy all these
brushes you're gonna know of because
you're like oh my god like he uses all
of them yeah oh yeah so if I started to
be the g.0 powder brushes part of the
Gundam metal collection it launched
after the guy metals lunch though so I
didn't have it when I first created my
first video it is a very very fluffy
dense powder packing brush it is so good
at applying powder foundation that's
what I use it for I use it for powder
foundations down my neck or on my face
or applying powder any kind of powder
this is great because it is so large and
circumference I have a huge face I'm a
 man I need a large like area to
be filled you don't have to mean so the
G 0 is actually amazing if you have a
larger face or even if you don't doesn't
even matter really just saying that but
it's just a great brush and I think it's
so compact this is when I take to travel
with me at all times I'm always with
this I'd never part with it
great powder brush you cannot go wrong
with this brush I kid you not so next is
going to move to the bronze
so for bronzer brush I actually just got
this brush recently but it quickly
became one of my morphe favorites
literally I'm obsessed this is the m-52
7 it is a paddle brush that is a white
like goat hair style brush it's paddled
so it has like that flat surface like
flat surface like that I use this
personally for bronzer this is what I
used to bronze up my face all the time
now I have not used another bronzing
brush in a while because this brush has
been taking my cakes taking the cakes
you know what I mean it's so
ridiculously soft it's just honestly so
freakin nice definitely check out the
morphe m-52 7 you will not be
disappointed whatsoever it's also a very
similar dupe to the for the Mac one it's
like things like the Mac one three
fibers honestly I don't even know the
name of the Mac one is a probably right
here floating in the air this is like 16
bucks the Mac one is 42 are you kidding
me get this one so next four blows just
go on do some blush this one is dirty
because I use it every day this is the
morphe 3 brush this is a tulip style
brush it's a very cute pointed little
cute Pharaoh I don't know it just it's
an adorable brush I just I don't know I
just love it
good system kill the elite launch that
morphe did was my favorite launch that
they've ever done I think the brushes
are absolutely amazing the bristles are
to die for the quality is amazing there
any of us for brand brushes which are so
much more expensive than these ones I
use this for blush I think it's
absolutely perfect you can use this with
powder and specific spots especially if
you're like more on the dry side powder
the t-zone for blush for to contour
because it is pointed you can always
bronze with it this is just such a
universal brush I think you cannot go
wrong with the e3 check it out you will
not be disappointed whatsoever like look
at this look at that perfect placement
so good so the next one is a foundation
brush other than the buffing brush I use
in the last video this is the morphe 6
is a flat top kabuki brush of all the
flat top brushes that i've ever tried
this one is my favorite because it is so
freakin dense like I don't smack the
bitch the size of it is literally like
perfect I just think it's absolutely
stunning it's also from the elite
collection so it is synthetic fibers
they are so so high-quality very dense
you can just really buff out a
foundation with this really nicely what
I like to do is I'll use my Dior flash
or foundations that are not as full
coverage and I now apply them using this
and I'll really build up that coverage
really nicely if you guys are interested
in like flat kabuki brushes I would
definitely try out the e6
between this one and the M 439 I think
it's called the buffing brush those are
only two foundation brushes I use
this one and the four three nine those
are only ones this is just taking my
life right now it is giving me life in
every way possible and I live and die
for it
so my last face brush I wanna talk about
really quickly is the morphe m5 10 brush
it looks like this it is actually the
brush I used to highlight with this is
part of the faultless collection I
believe one of the really popular
brushes is the M 501 buy more feet to
highlight with which is great and I
think I feel like Jacqueline started
that trend and I love it and I totally
use that too but for me honestly I don't
know what it is about this brush I just
like this one a little bit more it's the
510 but I think that this one is just a
little more in higher in quality I don't
know maybe I'm just stripping but I feel
like I like the white go hairbrushes a
little bit better for highlighting it
picks up product really nicely I mean I
used it today to highlight my face so if
you're interested in the highlighting
brush that's really really good it's
tapered it's small it's very like
precise and if you don't have that in
501 if you have that in 501 do not buy
this brush because it's very similar but
if you don't and you want to get a brush
that's really great highlighting at a
really cost-efficient price point try
the m5 ten you will not be disappointed
in this brush whatsoever now that we're
done with that face lines I'm going to
move on to the eye ones so let's go and
start with the biggest things go to
smallest it is the e 27 I literally use
this in every single I'm tutorial that
I've done and like the recent months
since I've got it I've been using this
only it is so fluffier reminds me of the
Sigma e-40 like a hundred percent
there's a little bit more dense so it's
little bit more like compact and it can
pack on a little bit more color so I'll
use this with like beaches and cream or
peach smoothie and just use it as my
transition color or just like put a
color all over the lid it doesn't really
matter it is just such a nice brush it's
super high quality it feels absolutely
amazing and it's so fluffy can you see
how fluffy that is like I don't if you
can tell it's like fluffy as look
at that fluff it is bomb so I would
definitely check out the e27 if it's in
stock I swear this thing is not on stock
all the time like and if you guys want
to well you can also use this as this is
just under random thing you can always
take concealer and use it for your
under-eye concealer because it is a
little small like buffing brush it looks
like a little pinky it's like perfect
size for that as well so it's a
multi-purpose brush but I use it for my
eyes as transition because that's what I
like it for and it works perfectly for
me how about that alpha change though
the reason I'm in another shirt and the
reason my makeup is different is because
I was going over my footage from this
video and basically what happened is
when I went to go on autofocus the brush
it like basically like stopped right
getting my face for the whole entire
video so the rest of the video I had
lost all my autofocus on my face so I
was like you gotta be kidding me
so I was super soft but you know what
 it up like I'm just gonna film it
like this and hope you guys don't mind I
think I left off by talking about the e
13 it is a pinch feral brush it is a
very very very similar to the Mac 217
but a little bit more dancing a little
bit more fluffy I'm so pick a product
really really nicely and still I blend
it into the other colors really nicely
it's not gonna be as fluffy so you're
gonna get more precise work with this
one I absolutely love the e 13 I think
it's stunning
so definitely check out the e 13 excuse
my makeup I'm sorry if it looks like
 right now but I did this makeup in
like 30 minutes full face like full glam
and I was like let me just a bitch guy
do it a bitch gotta - so the next I
brush is going to be the morphe M 507
love at the M 507 I think it's such an
amazing brush is a very small baby
pointed tapered brush I love you guys
and see it looks like this what I love
about this brush so much is that I can
pick up product with it and blend into
my crease really really nicely and very
very precisely so if I'm doing more of a
cut crease or a like really defined
crease with some dark colors or some
black in there precision blending with
this one is so much better
and it keeps the color right where I
want it to be doesn't like move the
color like a fluffier brush would what's
cool about this brush too is that if you
have smaller eyes a lot of the time it's
really hard to find blending brushes for
smaller eyes but this one is such a
great option for those of you who have
smaller eyes who have hooded lids i've
monolids like anything like that it is
bomb calm and this one's like really
cheap - it's like 4 bucks
well the next one is probably like one
of my favorite elites like of all the
lis collection that they launched this
one is like one of my favorites this is
the e36 is this small tiny little pencil
baby blending brush is so cute
what I like about this one so much is
that it is dense but it's so soft it's
not like a hard denseness with like
other pencil brushes that I use I use
other pencil brushes that are kind of
hard and they like her when I'm blending
out the bottom lash like I'm like yo I'm
like hurting myself this one is so so so
soft and it's just so good at getting up
into like the nook of the crannies a
little crannies up in huh personally I
use this for the bottom lash like to
kind of blend out everything but you can
use this brush for anything even an
inner corner highlight brow bone
highlight
outer corner like detail bomb it's just
a universal brush that I think everyone
should use second to last so this is the
more for e30 - it is a flat shader brush
it is very dense which is why I like it
so much the reason I chose this one is
because
it doesn't move very easily which I love
about it you know like there's a lot of
brushes that are shading brushes like
you pick up probably with it and you put
it down and it kind of like moves around
because it's not dense enough what I
like about this is that is so freaking
dense but still like flexible at the top
of it so like it's a little flex a
little bit you know it is seriously just
one of the best brushes at packing on
shadow using with concealer carving out
a brow with it I would definitely e32 it
is so good last but not least yep so
Hospital East is the morphe m42 one this
is an extremely small tiny little brush
it looks like this this is also a
another synthetic brush that is a great
packing brush for those way you have
smaller lids I love this because I love
to fight glitter with this or use it for
concealer so I kind of carve out the
broward um cleaning on my outer corner
liner it's just much more of a precise
brush this one I can use for anything
and I know it's an ORAC besides blending
obviously you can't blend with a little
bitch but it is so so great at applying
shadow as well it's just a multi-purpose
brush spread fix+ on it get a foiled
shadow pop it on there this brush is
definitely more on the flexible side
it's not as dense as the last verse I
was talking about so if you want to be
more flexible with the color this is a
great option for you or if you have like
less um let's make sure things like that
totally all good but it is such a great
alternative to like that Mac packing
brush that everyone talks about that
super super popular so definitely check
out the m42 one so yeah that's it that's
