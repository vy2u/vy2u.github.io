there's like this video to like me to
watch it but you guys do like me and you
guys loo like this video please like the
video and subscribe to my channel
let's get to this video okay
so let's go check this because I know
it's in amelong because I have so many
foundations like how I'm gonna do this
I'm not gonna like describe every single
foundation because we'll be here for
like literally an hour so what I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna say if I would buy it
again that's kind of how I'm gonna gauge
the foundations that I have so let's
start so first one is the Make Up For
Ever HD high definition foundation um I
really like this foundation it's a
medium to full coverage gives you a
really pretty
Demi satin finish it's really really
nice and would I buy it again yes I
would buy this foundation again because
it's really really pretty it's great for
events it's great it doesn't have any
flashbacks try to make a forever HD it's
really really nice I mean it's all over
YouTube for a reason next is the Kat Von
D Lockett tattoo foundation this one is
a full-coverage shellac feeling
foundation it's very heavy I don't
really wear this very often
honestly I don't I like to apply it the
most with a damp Beauty Blender because
it is so fat heavy and full coverage
feeling great for those of you are
really really really oily and need
foundation to like cover up everything
as well as stay on all day
what are you purchases no because I
don't grab for it very often those you
who need like a really intense full
coverage foundation who are oily awesome
this is is not fun
well next next one is the Amazonian clay
full coverage foundation by Tarte this
is another full coverage foundation with
it has like a very moosie creamy texture
I do like this foundation I really do
however the what I don't like about this
is that it will pick up on my little dry
patches in my face if I have a dry patch
from something if I put this on a show
it will pick up on it I don't know why
it will pick up on it but it will and
it's so weird I'm like why the are
you picking up my don't it's a
beautiful coverage it's really nice
finish the very long wearing foundation
as well and it's oil free I always tell
people to use this if they have really
sensitive skin who need a lot of
coverage but I worked at Sephora towards
this and lot of them loved it so great
foundation what I repurchase no I would
not repurchase actually because don't
like when I think my dry patches
whatsoever okay and this is the cover FX
custom cover drops I've had these for a
little while I've never actually use
them on my channel before it's like a
love-hate with these bitches honestly it
really is so I do and I don't like this
a lot of people rave about it on YouTube
people are obsessed with these custom
cover drops and I can see why because it
is such a cool innovative kind of
product you add a couple drops to a
foundation you make it more dense and
coverage or moisturizer or primer or
anything and it will give you coverage
cool idea what I noticed with this is
that if I use
silicone-based primer on my face before
I use this with anything it will break
on my face throughout the day it's so
weird
maybe it's just me or maybe just reacts
my skin weirdly for example I use like
to make a forever
smoothing primer on my t-zone and I mix
this in with any foundation I have like
an hour later it's gonna be broken right
here it's so weird I don't know why it
does this
I've tried mixing this with a
moisturizer just for like to go out
really quickly and it worked pretty
nicely but doesn't that man I don't know
about this I really don't know it's hard
I go then what I bite again no I would
not buy this again maybe I'm using it
wrong if you guys can let me know
because a lot people are so obsessed
with this let me know how you guys use
it because I feel like I'm just using
your own next foundation is the Estee
Lauder Double Wear stay in place
foundation so this foundation was like
my tried and true for so long I used to
be so obsessed with this foundation full
coverage stays in place all day it's
sweat resistant water resistant it is
seriously so good this picture does not
move on your face don't think that I
don't like about is that you can feel on
your face which is not a big deal to me
but it is a big deal to a lot of people
they do not like it when they can feel
foundations on their skin and I don't
care
humming I don't care but for a lot of
people they do they're like bitch no am
I gonna feel a because it won't dry
it out on you and will go on you like
shellac to the face glue it on for the
night for them make it on for the night
and wet it repurchase yes I would don't
Estee Lauder well Mac you see it cuz my
lips will come off next one is the
benefit hello flawless oxygen Wow that's
a lot of thing I do like this foundation
it gives me like a medium buildable
coverage it gives you like a satin
finish it's a really beautiful beautiful
finish I just don't reach for it very
often like I think this isn't probably
cuz it's not my color at the color petal
and I don't think it's my color I do
like the way it feels I do like how it
sits on the skin gives me satin finish
is really glowy it's beautiful so if
you're like normal or combination skin
you will like this what I buy it again
goes on sale feels on sale maybe I'll
buy it again in my right color there's
still so many more but okay next one is
the makeup forever matte velvet
foundation it is a full coverage
mattifying foundation that really stays
in place keeps you more matte throughout
the day I love this foundation I think
it's absolutely beautiful ladies on the
skin very nicely it is full coverage so
so you want to use a Content Beauty
Blender I don't really reach for that
often because they don't think it's my
color again I need to go to like this
bitch switch down because isn't shave
dirty and I think I'm like 35 it is a
really nice foundation for those
who are we and need to be mapped off the
day and need a lot of coverage this is
going for that so what I buy this again
yes I would vie to make a favor Matt
Velveteen next one is the maybelline
matte poreless foundation this is the
one from the drugstore anything I really
like this one nation like I really like
it is a medium to full coverage it's
very buildable feels really nice on the
skin I'm in shade 120 classic ivory it
is really nice for drugstore foundation
I'm very impressed not that I have a lot
of drugstore foundations I really don't
have I have two but the two I have are
like I research those shit's like
hardcore I was like are you gonna good
to me I can be bad to me and this one
was good to me so i'm very excited like
I really liked the maglame matte and
poreless foundation would I buy it again
yeah totally totally totally totally buy
your little ass again for sure the next
one oh my god the next one is my most
expensive phoenicians the most I've ever
spent on a foundation and I almost had a
heart palpitation right body this is the
Tom Ford tricks his foundation stick
looks like this to go stick foundation
Tom Ford it's Tom Ford like that
 is expensive this it was like 85
bucks I think it was so expensive I
bought it because my friend was like
reading about and she was like dude you
need to get this as is the of
all the shit's and the shits
it's that good this foundation is made
for people that are more on the dry side
more normal to dry I am oily ish
combination oily so this one didn't work
for me as well as I worked on her it is
a beautiful foundation it leaves you so
DUII so moist looking so succulent what
the that's our leader B coverage is
like medium to full more on the full
side it's very great coverage even with
mattifying primers I was oily like
freakin oily throughout the day that is
really nice for those who are dragon
willing to spend 80 something dollars on
a foundation great good for you what I
repurchase this no cuz it didn't work
for my skin type next one is the Becca
ultimate coverage complexion foundation
this has the pump that's really
cool this is a full coverage creamy
foundation it has like a very moosie
texture it does drag down to it like
more like
schlappi type finish is me more of a
what is this finish on remember I won I
don't understand forever are you what is
your little handsome you seen this one
nation is definitely more on the intense
side it is full coverage this one is
really great at staying in place like
this will stay on your face and
give you an immense amount of coverage
as well as not dry you out so it's kind
of cool I don't reach frittering often
though that's the thing I do not reach
for this one nation like ever I don't
know why I should reach for more when I
buy this again
No
yeah I would I'm gonna give it another
chance I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna try
this more I really do want to like it a
lot because it is beautiful
I just don't retry every often I need to
reach for more yeah I've never made for
you more I will bite again if I run out
but I'm not hmm next one is the Armani
luminous silk foundation this foundation
is a like a shared medium to full
coverage foundation it's very very
buildable it gives you a beautiful like
luminous finish time she is called them
in the silk it gives you a luminous
finish it will work on you if you're
oily dry or normal as long as using the
right primers to go with it I think
personally however for me like I used I
thought I loved this foundation I really
did every time I wore I didn't wear it
for too long and I thought that's why I
thought I liked it so much but recently
I wore it mixed with other foundations
that really worked for me like really
well and made my skin and I kind of
broke and look really oily in the center
and I knew is this because the other
things I use like don't ever do that to
me I've tried wearing this by itself and
it did give me a beautiful finish for
like the first two hours and then after
that I was like oily and I was breaking
and I was like like everyone loves
this foundation everyone loves it I love
it for the first two hours but after
that I don't love it anymore that's a
deterrent for me like so would I buy
this again no because it is $62 so this
was like 25 bucks
I would buy it again because I think
it's beautiful and I wear it out for two
hours but for the price I'm paying like
I I can't I can't wear it it just
doesn't work for me on my skin my skin
like wants to repeal this after a couple
hours it's so weird
so I'm sorry Armani I'm gonna burn your
ass again something home next is the Mac
Studio face and body liquid this is a
very sheer light wash of color
foundation it is so liquidy it's so
lightweight feels amazing during the
summer time on your skin it is seriously
such a good foundation this bitch can be
built from sheer all the way to full
coverage depending on how many layers
you put on water-resistant sweat
resistant transfer resistant it is so
good so see like if you're like a
teenager 13 14 15 who wants to start
getting into makeup try the Mac Studio
Fix face and body early get a sample of
it for Mac I like this so much more than
I like Studio Fix liquid this is such a
great guy foundation to would I buy this
again for sure when I run out I will buy
another one there's two versions there's
like the mini one and there's like the
biggest bitch one so this is the mini
version that it almost like they're not
you know I do
I said about the bigger one mm-hmm next
one is the YSL Fusion Inc foundation
it's like a little paddle and uh oh this
follow me I would probably cry take a
little paddle it's super weird whatever
okay so this foundation is a nice medium
coverage foundation it's very very
liquidy as I'm gonna not pigment out to
it so it does feel very lightweight on
the skin oh and it smells like roses so
that's really cool however it does pick
up on my dry patches than that that's
like when I biggest let people its
foundation like if you pick up on a dry
patch know that my ass will not be using
you like I just don't like that enjoys
me crazy I don't like it when
foundations pick up on my dry patches
it sucks I really want to like this so
much and it is so nice on the skin but
if you are dry in any way shape or form
it won't I think it will pick up on your
guys's patches like it did for me when I
buy you again YSL I would not I mean
 my stylish it was not cheap like
I have a lot of higher-end foundations
connetion is my like legit obsession
sore
I will not buy together otherwise though
next one is the one my favorite
foundations of all time like I just I
die this is the Loreal Pro matte
infallible foundation this is a
drugstore foundation this is the second
drugstore foundation that I own it is
seriously so good medium to full
coverage gives me a demi matte finish I
don't need to touch up as much feel
super nice on the skin it is seriously
so nice if you are dry I mean I wouldn't
really use as follows dry unless I was
using a really hydrating primer or a
moisturizer before it's not expensive
it's like 13 buds have my foundations
are over 50 and this is their team that
I like this more than those like what
the what the I make mistakes
in my life and I put it what I buy this
again yeah okay next is the NARS
all day luminous weightless foundation
so this foundation is so like
controversial on YouTube like everyone
is like either they love it or they hate
it I don't I don't see anyone liking it
like just like well it's okay it's a
pretty good foundation
I see people either love it or they
 hate it like straight up for me
I love it I do I owe the way it feels on
top of my skin it's so lightweight it's
so full of pigment how I need like three
drops to cover my face the normal
average girl can use like one to two
drops I use three to four because momma
wants that coverage done I love to mix
it with the Loreal Pro matte available
together it gives me the most beautiful
satin finish ever like I'd die for the
combination I will use it by itself of
course but I do get more oily throughout
the day when I
by itself because it is a luminous
foundation it will give you a luminous
glow to the skin when you put it on by
itself but I really like it you have to
shake this very well because it will
break in the bottle before that you need
to shake this bitch up it gives you a
beautiful amount of coverage but it
feels lightweight I really like it I
don't know a lot of people hate it but I
really truly love it for me or some my
ass you know I use my mattifying primer
in the t-zone and it looks really good I
love it I thought should do full I do
and if I run out while I buy it again
yes I will last but not least the
foundation that I'm like obsessing with
right now and I've been obsessing with
it for the past like month is the Dior
air flash this is like 60 something
dollars it's so expensive but honestly
for me it's worth every single penny and
I will buy this again for sure it is the
most beautiful foundation I've ever want
in my whole life it gives me the most
beautiful finish I never want a
foundation that looks this pretty ever I
use it with a flat top kabuki I feel
like gives the most pretty finish it's a
foundation I'm wearing right now and I
think that my face looks so much
prettier and more clear when I'm wearing
this foundation dries down to a like a
satin finish for a shirt it's not like
super luminous but it's not matte
whatsoever medium to full coverage I
like to build it to full coverage I mean
it does I use more product when I build
it to full but I really don't get lost
 because I love with this full
coverage I don't do this little hair it
looks literally like flawless
it looks like porcelain I do have to put
a mattifying primer in the t-zone
running where because it wouldn't make
people really like oil slick mess if I
don't what the way it looks I don't even
give a
I will forfeit that oil I'll be like oil
like I don't care I don't I just
admitted to me woah that was it I know
oh my god I know I have a crazy amount
of foundations it's not normal you don't
need this many foundations you just
don't no one needs this amount of
foundations I'm just saying I have an
obsession I have a weakness for
foundation it's the one thing that I
will splurge on and continue to buy I
would literally own every foundation for
every breath I don't even care I just
want to own the foundation even if I
don't wear it I just want to own it
so weird is like a collection it's like
it's literally like my collection though
like everyone collects things people
click buttons and bugs and what do
people collect I don't know hope you
