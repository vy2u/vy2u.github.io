this this is my first tutorial using my
man yummy weight and makeup geek palette
I've been dying to be talking about this
for so so long and I cannot believe
that's finally out I am so beyond
excited and I hope you guys are ready
for it as well look at these colors man
look at these mother Buckey colors we're
gonna do the look that I do with this
palette all the time this is like my
go-to look for this palette I love it
it's absolutely stunning and I think you
guys will like it a lot too so yeah I
already did my face I did my lips I did
my brows I'm just going to doing the
eyes on today's video and I'm gonna try
to do as many tutorials with this
palette has friggin possible without
getting annoying
so this is the first one and I'm so
excited to show you guys so let's get
into it great so first things first
we're going to be taking beaches and
cream and a mixture of Sora on a e27
brush and that's just gonna make our own
custom transition shade I love doing
this I especially with these two colors
sort is a very beautiful burnt orange
shade and beaches and cream is a very
pretty neutral light transition shade
putting those into my crease with a t27
brush I'm not just gonna go all the way
in as you can see it's depositing such a
nice amount of color I love doing this
with me 27 because I feel like the 27
brush by morphe is so fluffy and it
deposits a really really nice range of
color rather than just putting too much
on or too little on you're gonna see
just how easy this look is you guys are
gonna be like yes bitch as you can see
each is a nice orange e transition with
the crease nothing to him these clothes
are extremely pigmented so you don't
need to put a lot of product on it and
it's gonna look bump okay
taking a morphe m-43 three this is a
really nice dupe for the mac 217 or
sigma e25 and i'm gonna go in with
frappe which is a permanent shade by
make a peak which is a beautiful like
maple brown color and I think this shade
in the crease is so stunning I'm just
going to pack it onto the outer corner
just to give such nice definition and
really pretty warmth to the look that's
gonna go all the way in but just I'm
very light hand with that you don't want
to go too heavy it's very lightly go all
the way in then taking that 8:27 one
more time I'm just going to blend out
those edges you guys make a geek shadow
if you guys have ever tried makeup geek
shadows you know
that the blendability of naked peek
shadows are literally so good it's
insane how bond they are so you should
have something like this it's a nice
very just warm crease mmm the is
next bitch what the heck is that we're
gonna go in with Aphrodite which is a
beautiful plumage brown shade it's
stunning is a very deep color on a
morphe a 36 pencil brush I just want to
keep the color very concentrated where I
want it to be so I'm using a pencil
brush you can use any brush you want to
use but for me a pencil brush works
really great with this kind of look and
we'll start in the outer corner and drag
it up into my crease with the product I
have left on the brush
and I'm ringing that about one-third of
the way into my eye and then taking the
F for three three one more time I'm just
gonna blend out that Aphrodite shade
into the previous two shades just make
the blend a lot more seamless I really
want it to be a very seamless easy blend
this look is really definitely my
everyday look because I just think it's
absolutely perfection not to be a bitch
and not to be biased but I think it's
perfection you should have something
like this now that we're rocking that
crease hardcore just taking a little bit
of fix+ I'm gonna spray my morphe m4 to
one inch is not very flat packing brush
must be a little bit fix+ on it because
I feel like for a foiled shadow it makes
it look like a lot more intense and like
foiled you know it means just I'm gonna
do on this brush and then I'm gonna take
the shade at Luna which is a beautiful
topi pink color it's a very intense high
shine color I'm gonna go ahead and put
that on the lid now and I'm doing a
mixture of both packing and wiping
motions that's kind of how I like to do
the foil shadows by makeup geek and make
sure when you're using a foiled shadow
you're using the correct primer for your
eye if you've really really oily lids
you want to use a primer that's good for
oily lids like me
I use these Smashbox 24 hour one or the
Mac one the 24 hour Mac one whatever
it's called is really really good too
because they are very hardcore in
silicone and they're gonna help keep the
oil of your lids at bay which is what I
need for a foil shadow if you have tried
using a foiled shadow before and
increased on you try using a primer that
is very good for oily lids I'm just
going all the way up to frappe
like this and then taking that for three
three one more time we're gonna kind of
blend out those edges very very lightly
though I really don't mind it being kind
of harsh because I think it kind of
looks cool but I'm just gonna keep the
just a little bit on the softer side my
finishes topic I so then I'm going to
take the shade Artemis which is a very
pretty golden that's like a pale gold
champagne shade on a M 3 to 6 by
morphine it's a very small detail brush
it's great for the brow bone grief for
the inner corner so I'm gonna do I'm
gonna highlight the brow bone with this
shade very very very lightly though
because this is a very very intensely
reflecting shade as you can see it's
like bang on the inner corner as well
cine brush such a pretty intercourse
yeah do you see that oh my
lord oh my lord jesus okay great so I'm
gonna go and finish the other eye the
top of it
off of camera and then I'll be right
back okay guys I went ahead and I did my
mascara eyelashes and liner off of
camera I went ahead and just did that
part I really want to just kind of focus
on the shadows because that is what this
soil is because I see me do eyeliner so
many so many times really want to keep
it focused on the shadows okay and I
want you guys to have like inspiration
with the shadows you can do a wing with
this look or not you can do lashes with
this look or not it doesn't matter
anybody to the bottom lash line now so I
want you guys that part just in case you
guys Oh Kat reduce so for the bottom
lash line I'm gonna go ahead and take
Sora on a 18 pencil brush by morphe this
is a really really great pencil brush
it's a very fluffy pencil brush rather
than being so compact like the e36 is so
I'm gonna take that on the lower lash
line and just really run that underneath
and start building up that nice orangie
transition color so now we have Sora
down first so it just looks like a nice
just orangie underneath the high
transition shade now I'm going back in
with that 8:36 just kind of dust off
whatever color you have left on 3:36 you
might have a little bit of aphrodite
left so we're taking fat pay and that's
gonna go on the outer corner and let's
talk about halfway in to the eye the
beautiful like brownish maple shade is
just stunning after you go about halfway
in on the e36 pencil brush just kind of
buff out and give me some more color and
dimension on the outer corner taking an
e 43 I swear this brushes like my
lifesaver taking a 43 by morphine and
aphrodite one more time and that's in go
tight lined on the bottom lashline about
one third in just to keep the darkness
on the outer corner just like I did with
the top and doing the same thing on the
bottom like this and then taking the e36
and blending that out a little bit more
just what does it look so harsh and
start there and then grabbing any nude
liner I'm gonna take the tart in a rim
liner the new shade imma put on V in a
rim of my eye just kind of give me more
of an open awake look that's look I like
to go for with this shadow combination
and then adding a little bit of mascara
to the bottom lashes as well okay guys
let's go in zoom in to see with Isaac
like up close and personal
