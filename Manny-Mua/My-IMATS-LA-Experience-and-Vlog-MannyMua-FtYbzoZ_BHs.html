excited to be back I have been filmed in
a second second I'm super super super
super super excited to be back I have
another three weeks so I'm just excited
to be back and back in San Diego back in
my house my little home you know how was
that I met so a couple weeks ago and I
was in housing LA for a week and a half
and then I went to Vegas for five days
and it was just I haven't been back home
and I just got back yesterday and it
feels so amazing to be back I missed you
guys so much it's like the weirdest
thing like I can miss filming and I feel
like when I'm talking to the camera I
feel like I'm talking to you guys like I
really do feel connected it doesn't
really make sense to me I just literally
feel like I'm connected to you
bitches I don't you know and so when I
wasn't filming for the past like three
weeks I was like dude like this feels so
we're gonna feel like I'm not connected
to my followers I know I had videos put
going up because I was killing myself to
pre-record to like put videos up but it
just it's not the same when you're not
at your house and filming in like I
thought I was in here for you guys and
it's it's annoying being gone I mean I
had a great time but it was frustrating
and sinks I really wanted just to film
and be with you guys and respond to you
guys's comments and whatnot so I max was
absolutely insane like it was crazy it
was so crazy awesome
it was the most amazing amazing amazing
amazing experience like the first time
at LA I've ever been to did a meet up
with a couple of my friends from YouTube
and Instagram and it was great the
red-blue meetup - when it was such a hit
and it was so great it was so crazy I
was shocked at how I got recognized so
much and I'm not to have a bitch to be
like yeah you know how
recognized and stuff Lana I'm not like
that you know when I got stopped a lot
of times I took like I took a lot of
pictures and it was just overwhelming to
see not only were you there but you knew
I wasn't even stopped me and we took
pictures and there was a point where I
just got kicked out because it was a
line to meet me I was in front of a
booth and we were blocking the booth and
the security came up to me or like you
need to take this outside like you can't
be here being doing this and I'm like
bitch I'm not doing anything I'm just
taking pictures with my followers and
subscribers like big-12 you bro I was
shocking it was a point where I had a
security guard
walk me into a booth it was just it was
crazy it was so overwhelming it was so
amazing and it was just I feel like
after this joke
so like rejuvenated and I feel so like I
can do this like I can do the YouTube

cuss to because I'll sing at my friend
