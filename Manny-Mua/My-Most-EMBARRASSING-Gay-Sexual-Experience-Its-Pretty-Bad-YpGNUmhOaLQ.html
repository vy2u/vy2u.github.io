again to this cute first things first I
have a question from Naomi absolutely
putting it right here because I'm not
gonna be saying the handles it's too
much man so much I'm gonna try ask Manny
would you ever launched your own makeup
brand the answer is definitely yes I'm
actually totally trying to make that
happen in the future for you guys I want
to create my own brand it would be so
amazing to be able to like really just
create my own entity have my own little
child of a brand it would it be so much
fun you know and I feel like because I
am a youtuber and I'm a beauty youtuber
I try out so many products so often I
dunno what kind of formulas of things I
do like and what I don't like and I feel
like if I were my own brand it would
definitely the best of the best of the
things that I love you know what I mean
I'm not saying to be the best friend in
the whole world I would love it for that
to me like that I mean if I can try I
want it to be the best I can possibly
make it and because I do have a lot of
knowledge in the makeup world I
definitely would create a brand and I
think that it's gonna be happening
within the next couple years
that's definitely definitely my goal
it's gonna be very very very me it's not
gonna be named after me but to me very
mean and what you guys see the brand
like branding everything you're gonna be
like yup that's fuckin manis brand so
stay very tuned next question is when is
your collab coming out with what brand
nothing was off-limits remember Vanessa
okay so I can't say with what brand that
I'm colliding with just yet but it is me
coming out in a spring during like the
March in April months I'm so excited for
this club you guys have no idea how
fucking excited I am like because it's a
brand I'm so close with already like me
and the brand worked so well together
and I feel like it's give me such a true
collaboration what I will say about it
is that it's going to be like a little
mini clock
it's not just gonna be one thing
there'll be multiple things so I'm very
very very excited to have this next
collaboration come out I think you guys
will fucking die
save your coins up for March April time
and the club will be coming out so
autumn goth your asks hypothetically
what youtuber would you date so this is
hypothetical okay so I've worked if
we're thinking hypothetically speaking
what youtuber would I date I would
probably date Kyle Krieger so I think
he's a really really cool guy he just
seems like a really cool guy just seems
sweet he's like really handsome guy and
I just like his aura and everything
about him
who else like what I date I feel like
this is a really hard question I think
the guy from prank vs. prank like the
man is so fucking fine I would take him
too haha Inessa Anessa
ogre i don't know your name's Ari asks
do you have any New Year's resolutions
that's actually a fantastic question
because I do have a New Year's
resolution
my New Year's resolution is to not like
harbor any like hate in my heart for
anyone so if someone's wronged me I'm
like I don't fuck with them anymore I'm
just like no fuck you I hate you and I
think will avoid you at all costs I
don't wanna you like wrong to me I don't
want to fuck with you anymore you know
what I mean but I'm trying so hard and
like the new year to be much more like
just open and very just like free free
bird just very like you know what I
don't like you did wrong me in the past
but if someone apologizes for something
and just mean it I'm gonna try to take
that apology and hopefully it's sincere
and really just kind of move forward
with that and not like harbor any hate
in my heart that's like my New Year's
resolution is just to be a happier
person I'm running a very happy person
like do not get me wrong I'm a very very
very happy dude but it doesn't mean that
I don't get mad at people or I get upset
of people and does mean that I don't
harbor some grudges towards people I
just don't like I'm just trying to move
that way I'm trying to move in that like
just be a happier person kind of route
and that's I feel like what my news
resolution is for 2017 also get a little
bit skinnier that would be really really
great if I can just have a hotter bod I
would love to do videos like shirtless
I'd be fucking cool
Dez asks would you ever do a threesome
I'm assuming you're asking it would I
ever like be in a threesome and answer
is yes I've totally had a place um
before oh my gosh that's so crazy to say
there's only one time it was a last year
but it's like you know what honestly
like people experiment people have fun
people just do whatever the fuck what
they want to do no harm no foul no
judgement
I mean hey if you if you're the type of
person has threesomes every day that's
all you man like go you I've only done
it one time because it
like I was nervous and it's like a weird
experience I'm like okay you know maybe
maybe I'll do it again it was fun in the
moment so who knows what I do it again
probably if if the timing was right or
like the people were right I would
probably do it again
for sure okay Shelby asked fuck marry

I would definitely fuck Colton Haynes
because he's just like he's been like my

not it's Colton Haynes like he's my
number one he's been there forever marry
Jeffery no prenup uh-uh uh-uh and then

asked hi Sadie I love you tell us what
you're doing with Maybelline I'm dying
over here
welcome to New York I was gonna extra
today
let's get pasta I was the first boy that
Mabley ever posted on their Instagram or
on social media in general and they were
telling me that they like had a lot of
positive love and feedback and that they
really wanted to continue to work with
me because they saw like what a positive
feedback that it was and I'm like dude
that's amazing I really want to work
with you guys more so this was like my
first experience in New York with them I
really hope it goes well I would love to
be like a Maybelline ambassador or like
a Maybelline boy I would love to
Maybelline is lifelike is actually like
in my number one drugstore brand like
it's the most lucrative drugstore brand
of all of them
I'd like they have like the best
foundations of s concealers best powders
like I actually really love that Brent
really so such an honor to be part of
the project that we did because I love
that fucking brand like so much so Khloe
asks what is your most awkward sexual
encounter I love how this goes from like
either makeup questions or fucking okay
so I'm gonna tell story but if you guys
are younger than 18 do not fucking watch
this part
I remember once this is like literally
like five years ago so so so long ago uh
I had a friend and we were like do
things you know like whatever
I remember once he came over to my house
and like everyone was asleep everyone
was down then we're laying in bed and I
prepared myself just in case just in
case sleeping on the top and bottom buck
you just never know when it comes to in
the gay world so you want to just
prepare yourself you want to really
clean the sheets if you know what I'm
saying clean those sheets of the bunk so
that there's no mishaps
okay and we started to UM color if you
guys have seen Sex in the City color we
were coloring and I was in the bottom
buck and he was on the top bunk and also
I was like really awkward cuz like we
both smelt something odd and you know
what I'm saying you know what I'm
fucking saying cause it's not possible I
cleaned the sheets so then we stopped
and we're like what the fuck is going on
he was drunk my Jews like drunk and like
whatever and he's like looking at me
weird as if I fucked up and I'm like
bitch uh-uh
I cleaned those fucking sheets before
you came over so it is not me that has
moldy sheets it's not me all of a sudden
I don't know how this happened we look
behind him and he had shit himself he
shit on my bed on my comforter if you're
sleeping on the top bunk how in the
actual fuck to shit yourself
he was mortified and I was mortified and
he went to the bathroom showered I was
literally so mortified I threw my
comforter away in the trash and it was
just the word it was the worst
experience I've ever had probably that's
probably the worst I just felt so bad
for him cuz he like but then I also say
man I didn't cuz you lookin at me weird
as if like I wasn't like cleaning my
sheets and I'm like bitch you didn't
have fun clean sheets not that you had
to but like what the fuck how did I even
happen if you followed that story that
was the worst experience I've ever had
hell on earth fuck the next question is
Nova asks do you have a crush on anyone
um you know when it comes to me I'm like
a very like easily to get a crush on
someone kind of person it's so easy for
me like specially like if you're if
you're single and you're gay and you're
attractive of Lea if I find you
attractive like I probably have a crush
on you honestly it's like really weird
gay friendship is super confusing it's
very confusing when it's like so when
you're attracted to if you're attracted
to a guy that's your friend who's also
single and is gay it's gonna get kind of
like weird scene like the lines are
gonna kind of blur at least they do for
me I don't know if it is for anyone else
if you likes the same in the straight
world you know me like if you're
straight guy in a straight girl you guys
are both single you guys both are
attracted each other it's gonna be kind
of hardened to me kind of confusing you
know to me so I feel like I'm the exact
same way you know I feel like I've had
crushes on my friends so many different
times before and it's like if I get a
crush on you and you're my friend and if
you aren't feeling the same way if
you're single and attractive and we're
friends then I'm probably not gonna be
your friend anymore honest because it is
no point like it's literally I have so
many great friends that I do have
there's no point in me acquiring another
friend I'm just gonna confuse myself
over like over and over again so fuck
that
but yeah long question short I do have
press on this guy right now Haley asks
what's your favorite part about YouTube
and what inspires you to continue to do
it um I would definitely say my favorite
part is the connection that we have
you know that's honestly it's absolutely
amazing it's like the weirdest craziest
thing because I right now I'm talking to
a camera you know I'm talking to a
camera there's no one in this room right
now but like I know that it's reaching
you guys so it makes me feel like I can
talk normally and talk to you guys as if
you're my friends you know cuz I thought
you feel and also I love being my own
boss being able to decide what I
do when I want to do it is the most
amazing feeling in the entire world it's
like I think I could ever go back I
don't think I could ever do anything
else other than like doing YouTube or
like being an actor or something that'd
be really fun but other than that like
this is like what I love to do and I
feel like what continue to inspire me to
do it is you guys I would not do it if I
didn't have the amount of love and
support that I get from you guys you
know every single day and I know I get a
lot of hate and negativity but I get so
much more love and positivity that like
overshadows the negativity by so much
and if you guys continue to be happy
that I'm doing it then why would I stop
you know what I mean so yeah that's my
here partner and that is the last
question that I had screenshotted thank
you so much honesty if you asked me a
question thank you so much I really
generally appreciate it I just saw that
was trending on Twitter I was like what
the fuck it's just so fun to sit down
and like chitchat with you guys and let
you guys know like what's going on other
than that Tigers the night O'Day where
you guys are I will catch you guys in my
next video and thank you again so much
for asking a question if you guys did
ask me one and hope you guys were
entertained by this video I love you
guys so much and I will see you guys in
my next video bye you guys
you know this looks like a lot of arm
fat but it's all fabric my arm actually
ends right there just so you guys know
this is not on me I'm not about it's not
finding the way like fucking Dumbo okay
you are if you are not okay okay okay
okay okay
I'm going on a selfish shit my
cocksucking might turn off in the middle
of me buildings had to be handled
for me guys I'm sorry I see still really
