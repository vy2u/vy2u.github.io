as you can see from the title of today's
video it is going to be a nighttime
skincare routine I have never done a
skincare routine video on my channel and
I've had my channel for like a year in
four months and I've gotten so many
requests to do a skincare video I just
completely just not been good at doing
it honestly I don't know I don't know
why it's been so hard for me but I just
could not get a hold of myself to do it
I don't know just being Oh chicken chin
just not really knowing what to do and
how to film one but you know I finally
just took the plunge and I'm like
I'm gonna do it I was inspired by
Jacqueline because she just did recently
a skincare routine video hers is so good
it's so in depth so so so amazing mine
is not gonna be like that not so I'm
knowledgeable so if you guys are looking
for something that's really good in
knowledge and where someone was really
good at like explaining things well head
over to her video because it is mom I do
this every single night before I go to
bed and it kind of does change up during
the seasons right now I just fall in
winter and this is going to be like my
routine for the fall and winter time my
skin does see a little bit more dry in
this time so I like to be a little bit
more excessively hydrated in the video
you'll see so as always if you like to
like this video if you guys all I mean
please definitely watch it but if you
guys do like this video and you guys do
like me please like this video and
subscribe to our Channel if you aren't
already and if you are what is that how
are you gonna do I'll stop rambling
let's go and get into this skin care
routine go hey guys so let's go and
start to this nighttime skincare routine
um I have a lot of hair right now I need
to put a snapback on just kind of get my
hair under control
so I kind of start with a video with
putting just some water on my face
nothing too intense just a little bit of
water to hydrate my skin and then I'm
gonna go in with purity by philosophy
which is my favorite face wash of life I
always go back to it it's amazing get a
good little dollop of it
and I'll kind of place it onto my skin
just kind of like messily there's no
rhyme or reason to this and then I'm
going to use my Clarisonic to kind of
just go over the areas of my skin I like
to do it's 20 seconds on the forehead 20
seconds in the t-zone 10 seconds on each
cheek and that's just kind of how the
Mia tube works
I love the Clarisonic it is my obsession
I use it every single day
I just kind of rinse your face right
afterward yes bitch and then I'm going
with Bioderma which is an amazing oh my
god this is an amazing like toner as you
can see I love it right after I cleanse
my face I use this to cut it with a
little cotton round and kind of go over
all the areas of my skin and I'll notice
that I literally get off like more dirt
and grime it's the weirdest thing but
this is such a good product and you can
use it as a makeup remover as a toner
it's just a multi-purposed cleanser
water it's to die for
as you can see like there's like
literally like dirt on it it's so weird
and then we go on with the cover FX
drops these are the hydrating drops I
just really like these because they're
very very hydrating I'll use them by
itself or mix it with the serum this is
kind of what I use as a serum it is very
very lightweight and kind of like as a
light oil consistency it's bomb when
you're working in this product I like to
go in upwards motions I don't like to go
in downwards motions because I'm just
gonna age my face so then I'm gonna go
in with the Korres Greek yogurt
moisturizer this is such a good
moisturizer I love the Korres line
they're amazing the Greek yogurt line is
to die for and now just got put on the
t-zone this is so hydrating I like to
use this and I like to use the mask
interchangeably but this is just a
really good hydrating moisturizer
because it does have Greek yogurt in it
and it's very very nourishing and then
for the eyes I'm going with the benefit
it's potent eye cream it's just like a
very moisturizing under eye balm this
just kind of like my everyday easy eye
balm it's really hydrating I notice when
I wake up my eyes are less puffy and
they're more filled in and hydrated and
I just kind like to tap it on with my
finger then just tap the bitch on tap it
and then lastly I'm gonna go in with the
you Roma water by lush which is another
toner but there's just kind of a very
hydrating toner and I just kinda like to
spray the face and give me some nice
little rose and lavender scent to the
face and I love it and that's my routine
and that's it that's it for my entire
nighttime skincare routine I hope you
guys enjoyed this video and so much fun
creating this I thought was it's just so
different like not filming in your room
or not filming with the setup that
you're familiar with out alike take my
 to my bathroom and I was like I'm
doing I'm and have my little hat
on I know the products that you can
taste videos or more from like Sephora
they're not from like the drugstore
anything like that um I'm not really
sure about skincare products from the
drugstore I've never tried to need
skincare products with a drugstore ever
I've only ever used Sephora stuff
because I worked at Sephora when I
started getting more into skincare so
that's kind of why I kind of stuck with
that so if you guys have any suggestions
for cool really good skincare that's
from the drugstore that's like more like
cost-efficient I would love to try it
out let me know in the comments bar
below what you guys like and I would
love to try it out and like test it and
see what I think about it you know
everything I'll use in this video will
be linked down below as everything
always is and everything one of my
videos my descriptions are always very
on point like to pride myself in the
 description hair flip

else to say besides I love you guys

you guys are and I'll catch you guys in
