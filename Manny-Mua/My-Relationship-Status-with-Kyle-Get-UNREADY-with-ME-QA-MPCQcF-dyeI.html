unready with me queuing a video hmm I
just filmed a tutorial on this slip that
I have going on right now other than the
lip-to-lip I just added myself I'm
wearing tiny cosmetics mink that is
what's on my lip and I did a little bit
of jeffree star cosmetics Sagittarius in
the center to give it a little bit of an
ombre effect but that's what the
lipstick I am wearing right now is in
case you guys are wondering so I asked
you guys on Twitter if you guys wanted
to see me film a full face fall tutorial
using all like drugstore / affordable
products you guys said yes but you guys
also wanted to see me do a Q&amp;amp;A video so
I was like okay how the am I gonna
combined a tutorial using all drugstore
and affordable products so I figured I
was in a film at the budget friendly
video first and now I'm gonna do it
again unready with me and that do we be
queuing with you guys so I thought I'd
be kind of a fun way to mix it together
and still be able to do two videos out
of it this situation that we are in
right now if you guys do not know
already I am doing a giveaway right now

for today's video I'm just gonna do a
quick get on ready with me Q&amp;amp;A edition
you guys asked me a bunch of questions
with the hashtag ask Manny so let's go
ahead and answer
let's questions
guys yeah as always you guys dogging

that this is gonna be a meme moment
really but if you guys do like this
video please like the video and
subscribe to my channel if you're not
already and if reading you what's up a
man um you a and welcome to my channel
thank you for being here yeah that's
gonna get into this get on ready with me
it's my screen that shotted some
questions from you guys and we're gonna
go ahead and start off with the first
first question is from Angela Dolan and
it says if YouTube never existed where
would you see yourself now by the way I
love you so much
well thank you babe I love you so much
as well by the way I'm taking off my
makeup using the bye-bye makeup bomb you
guys know I love I love a lot of love
removing bombs
I love the Clinique one so much I just
ran out of that one so I'm using me
wearing it now I love them both though
honestly they're both amazing a
lash comes off a lash coming off so if
you two never existed where do you see
yourself now oh that's a good question
honestly guys if YouTube never existed I
would probably still be in like the
medical field or like I would be trying
to reach out or do stuff in the medical
field I literally was going to school
full-time I got my bachelor's degree in
health sciences so I was already going
to school for my science degree got it
and I was in the process of going to med
school we're applying for med schools
and make up kind of hit me in the face
and I kind of like stop me from pursuing
on that dream so if I did into YouTube
that's probably the route I would be
going
it wasn't my passion but I would that's
probably what I would end up doing if I
wasn't doing YouTube daniel freita
asks when are you gonna do it Daniels
that make up I'm gonna make it happen
Daniel Preta bitch if you're watching
this I'm going to clam the
out of you or we're gonna do it get
ready or something like we're going to
do something together like we're gonna
 film you little ratty ass I
 love you I love Daniel and Joey
so much oh okay we got we got a cute one
from Emily we have if a company offered
you 1 million dollars to give an amazing
review of a awful awful product would
you do it and be honest you guys this is
a really great question it happens a lot
in the beauty community this is like one
of those where it's like who would you
and actually you guys are gonna be
shocked when you're applying anything
yeah right I actually would not
do it like I would not film
I wouldn't film it like I just would not
do it for example I've made my career
off of being honest I have made my
career off of things that I love I
actually truly love them and I feel like
I love you guys will use my affiliate
code that you guys will buy things that
I loved because I am honest about it and
I'm not I don't give reviews because I
get paid for it to be a better
like product than it really is I'm
really honest you know and even when I'm
sponsored I'm honest I won't do
a sponsorship that I don't like for me
I've built my whole brand and built my
whole entity off of being honest and I
couldn't do a review on something and
say it was amazing when it
sucked reputation like my honesty would
be shot who the would ever trust me
ever again after that you know I'm
trying to come out with my Omega Brannon
trying to do my own thing I'm
not gonna like waste that opportunity on
getting a quick buck like I'm just not
and you guys always tell me so much
about how you really really trust my
opinion and how you guys wait for me to
try something before you even buy it and
I love that and I'm gonna keep it going
like that so if someone offered me a
million dollars to review a product that
was trash what I do it no okay
this I was getting asked so this is my
most asked question of all the
ask Manny's on Twitter my most asked
question is asking about Kyle and
whether or not mean Kyle Krieger would
date and what's going on between us and
are we dating and what the is going
on with me and Kyle right so you guys me
and Kyle are not dating we did do that
video together where we kissed to figure
out what the chat the traffic tell we do
the chapter sound together and a lot of
people were like oh my god they were
living they were living they've never
seen me kiss a boy before and a lot of
you guys were like you guys were gagged
and it was so funny reading your guys's
comments I loved it so much I actually
he used to have a huge crush on him
thank you secondly I got like a little
crush on him whatever I don't think you
ever those like ever really go away but
he has his own thing going on like he
has his own life he has his own thing he
has his people he's talking to and
things like that he has his own dating
life that he has and maybe in the future
if the timing aligns up ever would we
ever date I don't know I have no
idea who the knows man I I would
totally date him but right now has him
now it's not it's not like we're not
having and a lot of you guys I mean half
my questions are about Kyle and asking
if we're an item we are not an item um
and it is what it is man it is what it
is he's a great guy and I wish him the
 best of everything and anything
that he ever does a lot of guys do
wonder about my dating life and be like
why don't you have a vicodin Ben and I
just don't sassy aive asks what is your
thoughts on cheaters bitch cheaters you
got the wrong bitch I think cheaters
 suck I think cheaters are
terrible I think that if you're a cheat
you need to really really really
evaluate your life and I mean cheer when
it comes to like a relationship I mean
if you cheat on a test in school
shame on you but who hasn't but
I'm talking about personal I'm talking
about cheating like in a relationship I
think that's so up I can't even
imagine cheating or getting cheated on
out probably like call up in a
ball and die this is a Q s question from
Jeannie Hernandez if you were a drag
queen what would your drag name be I
love you well I love you too okay you
guys I didn't tell this story because
I've never told it online I don't think
I've ever ever ever ever told this ah
guys gasp but the first time I ever
tried wearing makeup was for drag I
actually went out and dragged before I
actually became like Manny anyway her
before I started doing makeup like
that's a before I worked at Sephora it's
like it was like literally like my first
ever like wearing makeup experience ever
was me going out and drag with some
friends so we did Halloween of course we
did a Halloween we we didn't save the
Sailor Scouts I was Sailor Mercury so
after that we thought was so much fun so
our friend was actually going to be
leaving um the state he was going to how
it works like in the military he was
getting docked somewhere else I'm not
really sure how that works but he was
not gonna be in signing anymore so he
decided that he wanted to do a drag
outing and drag like going out party all
this one out and drag and I was like my
first experience ever with makeup ever
and that's kind of how I fell in love
with day I was doing drag drag was the
first thing I ever did with makeup like
it was the first tutorials ever wash was
drag queens tutorials it wasn't a beauty
influencers or anything like that yes
drag is a huge influence on my career
Jennifer asks are you and Jeffery going
to do any more collaborations so the
answer to that is no me and Jeffery with
the Uranus is our last collaboration our
last part two of our collab I'm actually
not coming out with any more
collaborations until my brand comes out
so I'm actually currently working on my
own brand a lot of you guys do know this
and originally it was gonna be one item
but with packaging it's been such a
 bitch so I'm working on my
second item right now and I'm so excited
about my first item I'm coming
out with I can't really say exactly what
it is because I'm not done with it yeah
I'm like in the halfway process right
now I've worn a lot of it so far I worn
it on my Instagram
I've not tagged it you guys have
definitely seen me use it I will say
that the product itself I think it's a
little bit different it's a little bit
fun it's a little quirky it's very it's
like very mean it's so hard
explain what the product is without
saying what it is I'm excited to write
for my first product launch for my own
brand it's something that's gonna be
really really fun and creative and gives
me inspiration so that's what my first
product is it's that thing that has
given me so much inspiration in my past
and my present and something that really
helps me express myself so that's what
it's going to be first I know it doesn't
make any sense like with how I'm talking
and last question from Mary what age

experience I was 19 a month before my
20th birthday was my first sexual
experience with a boy just kidding
