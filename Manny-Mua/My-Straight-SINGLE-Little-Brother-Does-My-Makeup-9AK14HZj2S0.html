designs of the shit like they do Nick
that they'd really do I know for sure
they're wild and for those designs on
this right here okay yeah come on son
and now try the other side
Nick honestly has like the most softest
hand it's quite wonderful I'm not gonna
lie I might jab oh my god so now we
should probably do what we're gonna so
we all want we want to keep in a second
right ah you want to set it all you put
that that loose setting powder yes I
really know how to play this oh okay
yeah okay some brushes over here yeah
basically anywhere that we put a cream
product or a liquid we want to set with
a powder so it doesn't move so if you
think it's everywhere
and it shall be that she ain't going
nowhere nowhere like that so what's the
next thing what's next on this face is
beautifully set face gonna grab this
Marc Jacobs Oh mega bronze oh so that is
a bronzer and bronzer goes in certain
spots can't tell you but you know it
goes somewhere I know I know where
highlight goes here I'm proud of you for
that okay we can start with here let's
do that okay
the morphe arts are you sick that's
right use code man emu a and hogs to
save online and in store I'm having
approached chose our brush that's a good
one
we're really oh I'm pretty sure I'm
gonna ensure this gun something we're
gonna see but just see what why don't
you go and swipe and see if we got yes
day and used to where you really
supported that that I look you can't we
see and you really swore wow you really
wanted to highlight me okay you really
went in oh I like that I like the
whispering snatch the nose I'm so proud
of you that you watch my videos you know
you watch my right that's right I'm
glowing Nick I'm got a little igloo I'm
a god ass what are you going with right
now we have tart blush bizarre mmm I
love that okay jelly okay
I'm proud of you all you're gonna go
with the whimsical yeah we're going
whimsical owner oh not the big be right
back readings like he's smiling like
right without fat parties like the big
part thick oh the big part thick party
said okay Nick as if I wasn't already
going to the gym and had issues with
body
I didn't see no difference I don't
either
I really don't so we're just gonna I
guess change it and go to fortunate this
we wanted oh oh nice nice made oh come
on whimsical being a fly when you're
doing you on yourself obviously do it
even okay got it so when they're when
they're doing on themself just be more
you have to be aware got it blush your
cancel the blush is canceled canceled
blushes over and did you heard he here
for my brother blushes no longer like
she's no longer thing and now we got a
fucking boy now we got bronzer which is
this Marc Jacobs yes I love you guys by
the way I pulled all these products from
Nick I just lined him up and I'm like
Nick these are gonna be the things that
you're gonna try out
that's all you did once an it gets more
used to make up maybe we'll do a freakin
Nik chooses my makeup or something like
that we'll get more wild yeah well is
lime this is the first time probably try
to learn some you should and should
maybe I should eat shitty brother myself
yeah around the face yes Nick oh my god
up here I like what the sound effects -
what did you choo choo choo choose I
might if my makeup better than I do my
makeup that would be the guy you can
always use more bronzer you can oh
that's another lesson here from the
Nicholas key chairs you could you could
always use more bronzer there's never
too much highlighting there's never too
much bronzer there with Nick I am so I
could cry one here oh okay I mean you
obviously know what's best for me
cool so basically I feel like we're done
with the face here basis doesn't now
into the crazy shit uh
artistic part oh now we get okay wow
you're really getting you in on you
right now we're just gonna do brows so
we have a brow pencil here bow is tell
these bad boys in its kind of coloring
just think of it as coloring inside the
line of my brow
am I like coloring the skin or just like
making a hair darker think making the
hair a little darker making it just more
full looking that's the goal see look at
that it's already more filled another
one yeah I think that looks pretty good
I would love it to be a little bit more
filled but I think that the hell looks
pretty good I think this one looks way
better than the last one whatever you
gonna get this is this is your tutorial
on this is not look like dad what oh it
doesn't it I mean it's close enough
actually could be closer let's try one
more time
are you like filling in my lips brought
more than likely in my res oh yeah
oh yes Nick oh my god Nick this is like
really I'm impressed actually
oh my god I'm gonna go in guy do this
when you gonna prime my eyes so that our
base so we go like to cancel out all the
like redness of my eye now we have a Mac
Paint Pot to prime the eyes oh oh
this one like you think that you like
going with the shit-ton but then you
like just like do a little padding with
your finger or a brush and it ends up
blending out pretty nicely nice neck see
you see the difference though yeah yeah
so now we're just gonna strike yeah
decently soft has never heard that
decently softly nice Nick you primed my
eyes and now we go right into eye shadow
bitch what the huh so I gave it so I
gave Nick a bunch of little brushes like
a little high brushes of course when
they call them little brushes cuz like
the big brushes for the face yeah
there's a little I think you're just
gonna have to go for it okay they work
in from like the outer - oh I'm proud of
you for even knowing that in five seven
six that's right in five and fine yeah
that's the same palette don't worry it's
the same palette I use that yeah that
one picks up a line so much so fucking
look at Nick just like barely like went
in and picked up on it okay okay you put
it down with one side yeah it's gonna
come together
switch brushes okay yeah okay now I just
see shiny as gold so we're gonna use
bronze okay looks like the Goldi white
on the lid I wear lid okay
oh yo show me okay don't you thank you
so much and then like this just fill the
inner side now with like this you're
getting fallout again I'm back with the
back
sighs wow that looks good that looks
fucking good it looks pretty good pretty
impressed I'm pretty impressed I'm not
gonna light so I did all you had way
more than I might have to put way more
okay back in the steel of glitter we can
put the glitter over top to make it look
a little more I think that's what we
need
whoa yeah dead-ass you probably do
makeup better than a lot of people Oh
like this is like scratching your
freaking skin oh don't even worry I know
it sounds weird looks like freakin
sandpaper
that's pretty beautiful ever I had a
winged liner on in that photo you do a
wing just so you're aware because you
can't tell we have that okay karma keep
my eyes closed you just go I do you
think okay this is hard
35 I do violators I could okay okay you
know what yeah I'm lucky to be a little
sharper at the end I got something you
think I think you're getting this angle
this angle for you is actually working
okay doing this I'm sorry I'm old Nick
my eyes are sagging look a kitten wing
okay cool so now we're gonna do mascara
I'm gonna I'm gonna curl my lashes this
is the sky right is mascara
you fucked this up then you're fucking
this flop now you just take the mascara
don't worry about mascara on the bottom
on the bottom Oh bother
oh no they're going guns yeah come on go
input lastly on
Sam I'm not gonna let her ruin mink okay
yes bitch
yeah work look at that left when you put
on does really well huh we have a lash
on oh my gosh Nick you put a lash on me
I'm very impressed I always need to do
lips and we're done
and then lipstick first lipstick first
okay oh the heart yes
and we knew into the blender we need
gloss I was going to line these loose
maybe like overdrawn yeah it looks
fucking great that is like the lips as
you're calling some good coffee you're
getting crazy you know I feel oh shit
yeah talking glass now gloss me my lip
gloss is cool lip see this is just
covered on today this gives a different
texture can I gotta say I'm yang at the
lip dead-ass like feels like like depth

easiest also the highlight the liner you
