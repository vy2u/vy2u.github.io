about to be that girl later is so good
on you though
oh wait sorry guys I can't talk about
this Heather John let me fine little
nose a bit match oh now he's feeling his
fan associa
brow is and we're gonna lightly comb
through the brow do you remember the
first time you saw me in Minka you guys
as I said we grew up real religious yeah
we were like what the fuck that's like
but what was it like what was it for it
was for
code and you saw me wearing and it was
like really subtle though the first time
I saw you oh you're thinking that it's a
gay bitch I think I was I was pretty out
I was already out so it's like it was
like a shocker
yeah about filling my fucking beard that
shit fucking did not connect beard or a
beard pencil pencil o'clock in here
first guys whoever comes out that
Nikolai honestly should like why you
know you already here first y'all get a
pencil on the way for them for men inner
beauty okay I'm gonna go ahead and
finish the other brow off-camera and
I'll be right back those bras are they
carved out let me see sure are be sure
I'm priming them now this is to put
eyeshadow on top of so they can stay a
little longer I know how much you want
this on you for so long compared to last
me through the night it sure will it
goes right through the trade do it all
going out ok guys so now we're gonna go
on to the eyeshadow guys already know
I'm taking a life's a drag and I wanted
to show the versatility of this palette
is onto something natural on that cuz he
didn't want anything too crazy and last
time I did a tutorial we'll have to drag
it with something bold I would go with
something neutral do you like it I'm
gonna link this down below you'll ever
buy it
swipe up close close but not no cigar
sorry going take the shade sickening on
a morphe and 505 or to put that into the
crease close guys now now you're gonna
have your eyes closed gonna be thinking
soft serene thoughts NYX eye is on the
smaller side so we're gonna go ahead and
emphasize the crease by going above his
crease so you can see the shadow when
it's his eyes are open even though it'll
be a tad hard you're doing great sweetie
and sickening it's like a really just
pretty beige transition that goes with
literally every single look really blown
it out there way out there oh you didn't
go farther than that
ready now I'm just building up sickening
again I'm the same brush so now I'm
gonna go and take a morphe are 39 and
I'm gonna take the shade mug and a
little bit of hunty as well desktop you
don't need a lot we're gonna put it on
the outer edge very lightly cuz it's
just a really nice pretty warm Brown mix
with a nice little cool tone Brown does
even Sam just kind of building up
warm chocolate color out there in the
outer corner you guys I'm building a
lightly and I'm building from there
Howard rather start off with a little
bit amount of product and be able to
work with that then side with too much
product and try to backtrack adesh it is
so much harder to do so now we're gonna
go and you guys we're gonna take the
shade beet and I just really wanted to
show you guys because I've actually use
this on my channel just yet literally
the most stunning color you see this
fast as shit cause you have to me I'm
sure use my finger cuz I just feel like
with these kind of shades has a micro
reflected glitter in it so when it comes
to shades like this you really just want
to use your finger because I feel like
it really helps you press into
everything cuz it's such a soft shadow I
mean of course you can use a brush and
it'll look fantastic
I feel like the finger really like gets
that shit on oh my god it's really
packing it on nice and where I've lost
my finger I'm just gonna do this we're
just Nick I know you're such a model now
me the shade sickening again in my pan
the lower lash line now we're done with
the top of the lash line look you're
doing great there's like something about
like just looking at where my eyes just
want to like do this so usually when you
don't have a lot of eye space on the top
I can incorporate the bottom and really
do some color or like smoke it out down
here taking a bit of mug on the outer
corner
oh yeah makeup on you and you are Nick
MUA and you're wearing beat on the lid
that wasn't even there I love it okay
cool so I'm going to add a little bit of
eyeliner down shape just look down don't
worry it's a lot okay close your eyes in
their goods it there you go guys
a little bit not too intense just let it
dry first how am I gonna wing on this
ship you can tell this a little bit of
eyeliner now mm-hmm super shadow and
then they go into that okay so I'm gonna
go in with the shade shady from my
palette of curse on an angled brush and
I'm gonna just do a little bit of a
shadow winged just so this is another
really good trick to like help people
that have a hard time doing wings so I'm
just basically taking that black
eyeshadow running it over the eyeliner
itself and wing you know ever so
slightly just a little baby bit with
some slight when his eyes are open you
can't even tell it's like the cutest
thing okay cool so now I'm gonna go and
curl your lashes and pumice Cara and
some lash
on you and then lip and we're done the
lashes is actually this is when it gets
really include oh and just close onto it
close yeah easy like that that's all you
gonna do good job open your eye oh shit
yeah you sure do like surprises doesn't
like feel too much it's like on my face
so those are something that you have
like just shit on your face but doesn't
know but you don't really fit too much
okay look down guys you're gonna have
your client if you're doing someone's
mingi had their eyes open
well they pretty much don't so you don't
like shut them and glue them to show it
when they're closed what is on my
fucking face oh you have to get used to
good Oh 1,000 I feel like if I was
walking around with this shit like I
couldn't think about anything else but
like what the lashes oh my god holy shit
I could see a full fuckin layer of just
something oh my goodness I'm screaming
at the car windshield like that shaded
part of your eyes yes it's so funny
because I cut two lashes so much but
your eyes are still like pretty little
that they look bad dramatic on you damn
like that really like just like you're
really have some crazy makeup on you
yeah how is you orange when brazing I'll
be pretty it's out where should I like
that's what I just vision good job
