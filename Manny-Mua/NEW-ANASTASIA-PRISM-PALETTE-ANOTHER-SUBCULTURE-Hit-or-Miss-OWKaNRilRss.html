you guys sales video is going to be a
good fun easy chill relaxing sit back
play it fall asleep to it kind of video
I'm just kidding on what the fuck I'm
going with I'm like on a tangent right
now I just woke up from a nap so I'm
like I'm like in that zone you don't
mean but anyway today's video is going
to be a review on the new honest Tasha
prism palette this this looks like an
inside stunning gorgeous look anyway I
wanted to review the new palette because
of the last palette the subculture
palette behind a saucy Beverly Hills was
not my favorite palette that they ever
had came out with you know I thought was
a little bit too powdery was kind of
hard to blend and things like that I'm
just very curious about the quality of
this palette is it going to be so much
of a subculture is it going to be a
little bit harder to use like what is
the tea with the fucking palette so
that's what today's video is going to be
guys we're going to review and demo the
new prison pop on associate Beverly
Hills I'm actually wearing her new glow
kit for sugar glow kit which is fucking
stunning and I'm wearing their blush kit
too which I also really like as well so
two wins two hits in the holiday

great let's go and get into this review
okay so let's go ahead and talk a little
bit about the pellets itself okay ready
so we're gonna start on the pallet this
is the prison pallet the cover of it is
a fealty type black print
it's literally identical to the modern
Renaissance and the subculture when it
comes to the print I love this gold
detail with this prismatic feeling I
think it's fucking stunning I love that
the all-black packaging is very sleek
and it's beautiful and I'm fucking live
so you guys open the pallet of course
it's the same presentation as the other
uh Nastasia pallets is what you get
let's go ahead and right there that's
what she gets that's what it is we of
course get the dual ended and brush we
got a fluffy brush and get a packing
brush which i think is very very fucking
cool I love pallets that come with
brushes when they're nice when they're
nice I like if they're not at the
nuisance anyway so it comes with 14
shades and it retails at $42 and I
believe it's available already it's
available I think goes on the 2nd and
the 3rd of October and store and online
it's already available it comes with 7
mats for duo chromes
and three metallic shades eyeshadows
made in the USA the fuck usually they're
made in China which is crazy I had no
idea this wasn't made in the USA which
is awesome I think it's really cool that
they kept it at the price that they
normally keep their pallets even though
it's made in the USA which I know is so
much more expensive to make shadows in
than in China so this is really fucking
cool that they kept at 42 bucks I mean I
don't think they could really pick it up
because they already sent the prices at
42 whatever I think it's fantastic that
they didn't make it any more expensive
the brush is made in China the
eyeshadows are made in the USA
ok guys so for the net amount in here I
can't really exactly find it I cannot
find it on the palette you cannot find
the website it says net weight is 0.7
grams and point zeroes two ounces each
on associate Baron those pallets are
known to have not that much product in
them that is what it is they have a
smaller pan size that's how they can fit
so many colors in one pellet the Pens
are a lot smaller than a normal circle
shadow is and they have a lot less in
the pan but that's what makes it 42
bucks so it makes it a little bit more
affordable than pellets that would have
a lot more product in it so it is what
it is but honestly that's it
I'm so curious to see if this is similar
to the subculture I'm gonna swatch with
my finger just to see this is the
metallic shades I want to see or
swatching loose in
right here we have pyramid pyramid right
there
I just watched that one twice dimension
don't feels real fucking nice dimension
was stunning
let's do Spinks oh me pinky right there
Spinks and let's do osiris because
that's the one I think I wanna use on my
lid
Osiris right there so we're going to do
a swatch on the hand one one so this is
a couple of them right here so this is
the five I just watched on man right
here Osiris is a little bit more patchy
than the other shades are right there
it's a little more pouch you can see
more skin through but I can already tell
feeling these shades they're a lot nicer
already in subculture honestly they're a
little bit drier in formula they don't
feel as wet as the subculture palette
colors do but they're still really nice
I'm gonna swatch eternal eternal spills
very wet eternal feels very oily and
like Oh more wet consistency and I'm
gonna swatch thrown still more on the
dry side we're gonna swatch that one
want to swatch that one at least two on
the sides right there it's stunning what
those swatched beautifully makes me very
happy but I want to see the fall out
test I'm so guy that's what I did okay
we're gonna Pat we're gonna pat pat pat
pat you guys this is a good sign there's
some follow of course because that's a
natural shadow reaction so it's going
sort into this one tap tap tap tap tap
tap tap tap in oh my gosh this is so
much fucking better already just by
pressing on it I can tell tenfold
how much more pressed and tight and
compacted the colors are let's do this
one there's some follow of course is
some right here too somewhere here but
that's super super normal for an
eyeshadow palette that's very very
normal I like actually I enjoy some
fallout in my shadows I like to feel
like I'm getting some pick up on my
shades and really getting some
saturation and pick me in there I think
when I'm dipping into a eyeshadow and
there's nothing coming off I'm kind of
like the fucking knew it I actually
really do enjoy some fallout in some
pickup on a shadow but
not too much like the subculture had it
but this one was fucking beautiful
okay guys I'm already like living and
breathing gagging for it so let's go
ahead and see how they apply on the eye
because we did swatches on the fingers
they swatch beautifully I'm very very
impressed the matte shades were not too
powdery which is fantastic so now let's
go and put it on the highs and see what
kind of thing we come up with okay guys
so what we're gonna do we already just
dipped in with a twenty seven a fluffy
brush of course any fluffy brush works
fantastically for this and I'm gonna
take the shade lor which is a beautiful
rose petal II pink shade I'm gonna put
that into the crease and see how that
acts on the eye and see how it blends
out looks I'm noticing right now no fall
out on the eyes whatsoever picked up
beautifully didn't have too much powder
pick up this is less powdery and intense
then the fucking amount of Renaissance
palette like this is such a beautifully
pressed palette I'm very very impressed
and I'm not just saying that you guys
know I fucking read the subculture
palette to fill I'm really really really
loving with this palette so far so now
guys I'm gonna take a morphe r39 I'm
gonna take this shade Eden which is a
basically like a peach like deep peach a
need some fucking beach so we're going
to place that into the crease and mix it
in with lure oh that's so fucking stun
so guys I'm noticing of course that Eden
is acting the same way as Laura its
blending out so beautifully and there's
no excess fallout on my face it just all
kept on to the brush really nicely of
course with Fallout you guys definitely
under like make sure there's no fallout
on the face which I've been doing but
I'm just letting you guys know I'm just
kind of talking through with y'all so
I'm taking that same r39 and i'm take
the shade parallel which is a deep deep
brown and that didn't go on the outer
corner ooh
it's fucking beautiful honest us yeah
y'all did fucking that only the outer
crease guys are actually gonna keep that
on the outer crease only I don't want to
go too far in with it I wanna keep it
deep out here guys okay I'm so torn
right now because I really want to use
Osiris or dimension or throne I don't
know which one to use though
Osiris watching it it feels so dry like
this is actually a pretty dry shade of
the pallet like it feels very like press
down really hard
thrown swatches beautifully and
dimension swatches fucking beautifully I
think we should just do fucking
the room cuz that's still not speaking
to me right now do it fuck it I'm going
in oh my god we're going in guys this is
a duo come Shane Oh
oh my god I love it I love it and it's
applying beautifully on the eyes of
course I'm using my finger with this I
just enjoy applying intense lid shades
like with a finger so straighter like
more duochrome me let me try a little
bit with the brush just to see what we'd
get off of a brush
okay picks up pretty nicely on a brushes
the color right here this shade though
guys I will say this shade it does give
out some fallout there's definitely some
follow happening with my finger it's not
just with the brushes it's happening
with the finger as well he's a really
really really really kind of impossible
to avoid fall out with you finishing
there really those hyper intensely
pigmented shades come on that's gonna be
the fallout okay
oh that's so pretty now just go ahead
and blend in the Eden and lower shade
with the lid shade just to make sure
there is a nice easy transition and nice
beautiful blend that we're doing okay
guys this what we got so far on this eye
I'm gonna go do the top of the eye on
the other side real quick and I'll be
right back okay she is getting it
together I'm fucking living and
breathing for this fucking lot and I
think that uh Nastasia did an amazing
job with his palette so far now I'm
taking morphine 36 I'm gonna take a
little bit of that black shade obsidian
which is a beautiful name for a black
and I'm gonna put that on the outer
corner mixing the brown with the throne
shame and then to the crease really
really deepen it all nut hmm
taking a little bit of that same and
4-3-3 from morphe just gonna blend out
that black a little bit I'm gonna take a
little bit of this shade dimension on my
inner corner of my eye because it's
honestly been speaking to me this whole
time and I don't know why I haven't been
listening or take a little bit of
dimension it's like a really pretty
lavender bright shade to combat that's
stunning their own shade that's sickest
fuck that is sick as fuck
I live taking out how to morph um to ten
just a little packing brush so that's
our base color right there I take a
little bit of Lucid which is a lighter
shade but that even closer in okay guys
so now that we have at the inner corner
done I feel like it's very very smoky
and vampy
by this for what I'm liking because I
really want to be extra and that bitch
I'm gonna take Osiris which is that
really pretty bluish purple shade on a
pencil brush I'm gonna run that on my
lower lash line huh okay okay guys the
shadows not my thing I thought it was
going to be my thing but it's definitely
not my thing I mean use my finger
instead I mean we can definitely make it
work you can definitely definitely it
work it's not as nice as the other
shades are that's for fucking sure
and then you cook it looks really
patching and intense I'm like oh not the
biggest fan but of all the shades that's
the only shade I didn't really work for
me like I really wanted to but you know
what that's so far it's only been one
shadow and this whole palettes I didn't
like so that is totally fine with me I
feel like that's still a very positive
experience it's just not my favorite
shade take a little bit of lore and I'm
gonna put that underneath my Cyrus just
to blend it out a little bit doesn't
look so harsh on this morphe e18 brush
this is a bigger pencil brush whenever
I'm doing anything like on my lower
lashline guys like blending out my lower
lashline I'd like to take an e 18
specifically it's just small precise
brush like a but it still pencil brush
which is really really cool okay amazing
let's do some eyeliner I love you guys
always tell me that you want to see me
do my eyeliner but I don't know why it's
like such a boring theme and I never do
it correctly in front of you guys I'm
always like it's not my fault P shying
I'm liner shy you know
of course it was going so well it's okay
we can always make it drag that's fine
we can make it drag if we need look a
little rough but uh I'm gonna finish the
other eyeliner off of camera and I'll be
right back awesome for some lashes on to
make it look more kunti okay guys we
have the lashes on now we are wearing
Lily Miami lashes my go twos or take a
little bit of my NARS pot that I always
always always use I'm going to do a
quick little line underneath my we're
gonna let that set in place and I'm
gonna put that green shade because I
really wanted to use that one to put
that green shade underneath and then
we're gonna take that same brush I'll
gonna take shade sphere which is the
really cool minty intense Ashley this
one has a lot of kickback on it but it's
a neon shade so I don't really expect
anything less
I'm going to press the concealer would
you like a fun little different line
y'all do not need to do this but I think
you're just a fun little pop and the
reason I put the concealer underneath is
because he's gonna actually make it more
vibrant and pop a little bit more also
guys when I was off of camera I add a
little bit of that same glow kid on the
brow bone to give me a little bit more
of a highlight but this is what we have
you guys this is the eye my fucking lip
you guys we are finished with the look
this is what we have going on right now
on my lips in case you guys are
wondering I am wearing Kylie cosmetics
hazel lipstick this is from their new
holiday collection coming out also I
added a little bit of black eyeliner on
my inner like waterline just to give it
a little bit more of a smoky feel and
this is what the look turned out to be
an absolutely fucking love it but anyway
what do I think about the palette is it
a subculture part too is it better than
the subculture how is this present
palette in comparison to the other
shadow palettes and I have to say guys
this is one my favorite palettes on
associate has ever ever ever done other
than the modern renaissance that's like
of course my number one it's like holds
a special place in my heart but I
honestly think they did an amazing
amazing job the shadow quality is so
much better than these subculture
palette the one at least I tried I'm not
sure exactly if they recalled some and
put more out I don't really know exactly
if they did that or not or if the
palettes that are out now are better
than what they were putting out in the
beginning anyway all I'm saying is that
I think that the prism palette is so so
good and definitely worth the 42 dollars
of the price point I think the shadows
are beautiful there were some hiccups of
course that
one shade Osiris was not my thing at all
but everything else other than that was
fantastic and I'm so so happy to see
that they come out with such a beautiful
palette following this of culture
palette great job to anastacio Beverly
Hills you guys fucking killed it with
this palette and I think it turned out
so beautifully and I think you guys just
about ready yeah guys that's it for
today's video I hope you guys enjoyed
