you can see from the title of today's
video today's video is all about the new
honest ostium Beverly Hills Modern
Renaissance palette this beautiful
beautiful stunning mother fucker do you
guys die for this because I literally
die I live and breathe for it I
absolutely love this palette this is
their new summer collection launched I
believe and I feels like it has like
this nice really soft pink felt e-type
packaging it's just so pretty I believe
that the pans and this palette are
actually larger than their previous pans
on their previous palette so it is a
little bit more expensive I believe the
other ones were usually like two
thirty-five thirty-six this one is 45
for 14 shades but I really don't think
that's unfair whatsoever and this is
actually a permanent pop of them so I'm
so excited for them actually let -
osseous bread I think they do - such
beautiful amazing products oh um this
look is inspired by someone on Instagram
hold on let me find it this I like
higuaín right now is actually inspired
by Sophia LCS makeup on Instagram I'll
leave a little photo of her right here
of her look she used the same exact
palette as me and I saw it on Instagram
on a sauciest page cuz she reposted her
and I was like dude I am obsessed with
this look so much that was like I need
to recreate this for my followers on
YouTube because not always our Instagram
makeup people on YouTube where they get
her created look and you can see it on
YouTube and learn how to do it yourself
so I wanted to take that look because I
thought was so stunning and implemented
into a video where you guys to actually
learn how to create the look that she
did on Instagram Sophia you did such a
beautiful beautiful job and I hope I did
you justice in this look as always if
you guys don't like this video if you
guys don't like me please don't fucking
watch it you know the drama that I watch
it but if you guys do like this video
and you guys do like me please 'like
this video and subscribe to my channel
if you want already and if you're new
what's up at mani MUA and welcome to my
channel and thank you for being here so
let's go and get into this really
beautiful soft modern Renaissance
I look
so let's go and get started on today's
video using the modern renaissance
palates by anastasia beverly hills you
guys when i open this package I was so
beyond excited if you guys saw me on
snapchat I was living I was breathing I
was dying for I was gagging I was
gasping for air I died I came back to
light it was everything
so this palette is just Ashley amazing
the colors are fucking gorgeous so we're
just going in I'm gonna taking morphe 27
and I'm gonna go in with golden ochre
which is a nice just whoo careful cuz it
kept the powders are really pigmented
I'm gonna take a mixture of golden ochre
and burnt orange and not something go on
at you 27 and go into my crease very
lightly done Astacio shadows are so bomb
and it's funny because in the beginning
when they first launched eyeshadows they
were nice like they were good like they
were definitely good showers but they
weren't like my go-to favorite ones I
don't know I just didn't like them as
much as I liked other shadows but now
jobs they've been coming out with I've
been so nice so creamy so blendable and
I just love them okay so now I'm going
with a morphe and four three three I'm
gonna mix red ochre and regular no real
gar rip realgar I don't know how to say
that I'm sorry guys real gar and red
ochre and that's going to go in my
crease this palette was inspired by
renaissance paintings and I'm sure these
are probably named after some paintings
or some people that made the paintings
who fuckin knows to be honest I'm not
really that well-versed in that world as
much I'm not so scholarly man I went to
college but I'm not using my college
degree now no I'm not so we're gonna
push that into the crease hello when we
have the transition shades we're gonna
push that a little bit lower not too
heavily just very very lightly keeping
the most pigment on the outer corner
because that's how the photo is the
outer corner has the most amount of
pigment just take a morphe and four
three three and blend that out
mind if I wasn't recording this entire
time sometimes I get like so scared that
that's not recording and all I have a
panic attack moment then I'm like wait I
am recording so now I'm gonna go in with
the shade Venetian red and this is a
really cool like cranberry shade I think
it's a little shimmery tool it has a
little bit of shimmer to it and I'm
gonna put on an outer corner with a
morphe g27 this is a pencil brush I've
been searching on Murphy's website for
the e36 can't find it I think it's being
discontinued so I'm trying to use other
alternatives for you guys like another
pencil brush like it the more feet
g27 as another great alternative for the
e36 because i know it's really really
hard to find so we're gonna put that on
the outer corner just to give me that
cranberry tone back to the look I'm
bringing in maybe about one third of the
way in barely bring it in and I just
continue to blend that out as you can
see it turned a little bit more cran I'm
really digging the crane color so once
you blend it out out to your liking I
think it looks pretty nice right now
it's nice and blended my crease is
looking defined in Chrissy I'm gonna
take the shade Cypress umber which is
like a dark chocolatey Brown and while
I'm doing a very small amount of that on
that same more feet pencil brush I'm
gonna be doing a winged liner with this
look so it's not going to be like a
crazy amount just a very small amount on
the outer corner just to add a little
bit definition and I'm just pushing that
in with that morphe brush very very
lightly because I really don't wanna
take away any of that cranberry tone
that we have I think it looks so nice
take that M 4-3-3 and blend that out
slightly awesome so we had everything
blended out and I like how it's looking
we are serving tuna on a platter
realness fish for days fish for months
fish for years okay so now I'm gonna go
in with Primavera on a morphe M 210
amazing packing brush you could always
use the one that it comes with because
it does come with the packing brush but
I like the morphe ones a little better
than a bit softer no T no shade at all
usually palette brushes I'm not really
the fan of ever so we're just gonna go
in with this brushes to the M 210 we're
gonna pack Primavera all over the lid
it's nice soft like golden shade Oh took
a beautiful golden champagne no I love
and on the inner third I'm gonna take a
Vermeer which is a very light almost
pinky shade that's an inner corner as
well a little bit on the lid blend it
into the previous lid shade and then
just blend between the edges with a
morphe m-43 the same one that we've been
using just cuz it's easier it's already
there okay awesome so this is what the
top so that I should look like now it's
looking very pretty very just absolutely
soft and dainty but very very gorgeous
I'm gonna go ahead and do eyeliner I'm
gonna take the cat Maundy super eyeliner
and just do a wing with that honestly
trooper by Kat Von D is just my go-to
favorite eyeliner it's so easy to use
you can get a sharp line very very
easily it's a very black I just
really really do enjoy this eyeliner so
go into studio win how you really do it
okay great so now that we have the
eyeliner on it should look something
like this it is a very easy not too
intense not too too too bold of a liner
I don't that's too bold for you but did
a liner however you would like to do it
I just like to do a hair like this this
is actually really subdued liner for me
someone and I think we're pretty good so
I'm gonna go ahead and do the bottom of
the lash line now on the photo it says
that all she used was love letter so I
think that's we're gonna going what
we're gonna take just a love letter on
the lower lash line I'm gonna take that
same g27
and dip it into love letter which they
really pretty like blemish pink actually
sunny I might mix more than just this
color but for now let's just try this
because I don't know what looks yeah so
we're gonna use that this color is
stunning holy crap I'm actually gonna
take a little bit of golden ochre Emma
on the underneath this part just to give
me a little bit more of a seamless blend
and then I'm gonna put the colourpop lip
liner in the shade and Lari any burgundy
eyeliner will work I just can't find any
Burgundy liners right now I'm gonna run
that underneath the lash line Burgundy
by Mac woodwork rig - I thought this
color would be absolutely perfect for
this look okay clever to go finish the
other eye off camera okay and I'll be
right back
okay grey so now this is the final
product I have the lashes on I'm wearing
iconic by house of lashes and I thought
that this will be such a pretty lash
with this look because everything is
really just like elongated and there's a
wing and there's an outer corner and I'm
done with the eyes so I'm going to be
guided to see what they look like up
close
okay great so now that the eyes are done
we're going to continue on with the lips
now I'm gonna take a lipliner and
lipstick there's actually the most
expensive lip combo I think I've ever
done on my channel should I do it still
yes I will
so I'm gonna take the Charlotte Tilbury
lip cheat in the shade iconic nude and
this is a nice neutral Beijing nude
shade to lip line it's funny cuz it's
actually look more like a brown beige
lip liner and I don't ever go for those
like reflect pinky tones so this is a
little different for me and once we are
lip line and we look like a cholita from
the fucking south and from batio we're
gonna take the YSL lipstick in the shade
number 10 Samantha this is Samantha
always talked about the shade and I
bought this in Canada so but you know
what if I'm gonna buy this YSL color I'm
gonna buy it in Canada one because the
dollars better and two because Samantha
lives in Canada so I wanted to use this
shade I've actually tried it on camera
yet but it's absolutely beautiful you
guys are gonna freaking shit yourself
just had this like her perfect nude
shade and I completely agree with her
it's absolutely stunning
such a beautiful formula consistency I
it's not matte at all it's not settin
it's definitely more of a cream
consistency it's very very pretty and
lightweight feeling but it's very creamy
and hydrating and this is the final look
and that is it for the entire video hope
you guys had fun watching this I had so
much fun crannis look for you guys as
soon as I got this pure package I was
like I need to create a tutorial with
