let's say this video I am so excited as
you can see I'm kind of smiley and kind
of giddy and just excited in general for
this video because it is going to be a
review first impressions demo on the new
jaclyn hill eggs morphe collaboration
palette this is what it looks like right
here i swatched a couple shades not
gonna lie i swatched a couple because
they were so fucking pretty and they
just looked like they were calling my
name's i swatch like a couple i don't
really know how to enact on my eyes yet
if I have swatched a couple of shades
and I'm very very much impressed so far
so I'm really excited I'm just so proud
of Jaclyn for creating this palette it
is 35 custom shades it's not anything
that morphe already has acting it's
really cool that morphe let Jacqueline
take the reins on this palette she'd
been working on this for years and
Moorefield just like it's okay we're
gonna we're gonna it's gonna be worth it
when it comes out because Jacqueline is
a perfectionist and she is a hyper
person works like yo if we're doing this
we're gonna do it right that's one of
the things I love about Jacqueline's
actually worked so hard and worked so
meticulously at creating products that
she thinks you guys are going to love or
that her followers are going to love and
I love that I think that's really really
important I'm the same exact way I think
it's so important to feel like if you
collaborate on something trying to make
it the best thing that you can possibly
possibly make it because people are
buying it people are trusting your
opinion people are trusting your name
that's something that you're gonna
fuckin love so I think that it's amazing
that Jacqueline really put her heart and
soul into this palette and so did morphe
too much crazy just popped into my head
right now is that Jacqueline a couple
years back created that palette with
morphe it was a favorite palette and it
was just her favorite shades that morphe
had and they put into a palette right so
I remember years ago I reviewed that me
and Jacqueline were not friends me I
reviewed that on my channel and I
thought it was a great palette that was
wonderfully done I love the color scheme
of that palette as well and that was the
video that turned chocolate onto me and
we became friends after that video
because she saw it and she just thought
how it was a really I guess sweet guy or
something I don't know I'm I don't know
so just funny that now jacket has a
custom palette with more few years later
and I'm doing another review on it and
it's just like I just kind of came full
circle to me like whoa
Jacqueline went from like her favorite
does her favorite shadows to like
creating this custom palette with morphe
it's just really cool it's just really
really really cool to see so again
congrats to morphe and jacqueline for
this palette I'm very excited for you
guys I think it's going to do so well I
think it's gonna sell out so fucking
quick so if you guys want to get your
hands on it get it on the day launches
please because I think it's going to
move like a fuckin
water you know water moves so yeah you
guys that's what a speedo is going to be
it's a full demo review first
impressions it's going to be all of it
combined using the new Jaclyn hill and
morphe palette so as always if you guys
like this video if you guys do not like
me please don't fucking watching electro
with that Koopa do but if you guys do
like this video please subscribe to my
channel if you're not already any for
you new what's up a man um you a and
welcome to my channel thank you so much
for being here I really from the bottom
my heart appreciate you guys watching my
videos allowing me to do what I love
every single day so um yeah let's go
again to this review and demo of the new
at Jaclyn hill x morphe collaboration
palette okay so let's go that you talked
about a little bit about the palette
first before we starts watching before I
start playing with it on our right so
this is the pot right here 35 custom
shades tons of maths tons of metallics
tons of shimmers just a sickening as
looking palette like I'm ready to play
so there are 35 shades in here all of
them are custom shades and it's going to
retail for $38 so that's basically like
a little bit over a dollar per shadow
and you can use affiliates codes on this
palette you can use Jacqueline's code
you can use my code Manny MUA and stores
are online and you play that you guys
like and that you trust
user code why the fuck not user code and
it launches next week on Wednesday I
believe it's the 21st of June and after
the palette comes out so if you guys
noticed here the palette does not have
any names of the shadows on it it is a
cardboard palette and not like they're
morphe plastic ones that they usually
have but it came with this really really
cute little thing which actually shows
the shade names I mean I can tell
because the lighting is pretty bright
but it shows the shade names of each
color on it so while I would love to
have had the palette have the names on
the actual palette to see what I'm going
in with and know the color name usually
there's not enough space on these kind
of paths because they're so compact with
colors and there's just not enough room
for names so I think that's really
genius that they created this little
paper to show the shade name so I
thought that was one fucking Jean yeah
so I have no makeup on my eyes stay
because I want to do a full fucking
tutorial first I wanted to swatch them
the colors I just kind of spoke to me if
you guys want to see a full in-depth
swatch like crazy madness of swatches go
watch Jack on this video I will leave it
linked down below if you guys want to
hear it more about the backstory of this
palette I'll leave a link down below and
you guys wanna see more like arm
swatches and things like that so we're
going to swatch
marry here it feels wonderful whoa like
that feels amazing let's watch this one
ridiculous
let's watch this one let's I could do up
this like a dual chrome shade right
there as you can see right there let's
watch this gold I really want to use
that gold right there I really want to
use this color Oh
let's watch this pretty burnt burgundy
swatch swatch swatch oh my god Wow a
swatch and swatch holy fuck they swatch
hella bomb um hi so we have the shins
right we have five sheets right there
let's watch the purple fuels amaze let's
watch the blue kind of bouncing have it
I now in the dark blue let's do this
really pretty mint and let's swatch this
really pretty taupe right next to it it
feels great so we have these five here's
the topi one here's other for the swatch
I'm right above this wow yeah and we
have a couple more swatched right here
this is the five shades underneath
honestly truly I am very much blown away
with how beautiful the pigmentation is
and how smooth the shadows feel the
mattes
holy fuck the matte transition shade
felt amazing oh so soft so buttery okay
so we are now primed and ready to go
it's not as far as I can zoom in by the
waist a lot people do ask me to zoom in
farther in what I'm doing I looks and
guys this is as far as I can zoom in my
camera is a cross on the table and I
don't have a different lens
um maybe one day when I get like a
person that can help me film and edit my
videos I can get to a level where I can
do fucking close-ups of this alright now
I don't know how to blow down I'm not
not gonna it just yeah so this is as far
as I can go in for you guys I can try to
lean in as much as I can but um for
clarity and like for being as clear as I
can with the lighting this is as far as
I can go in just letting you guys know
so you guys let's go and get into this
video I decided I really want to do a
fun like golden eye with a really warm
burgundy in the crease just something
really fun and pretty and very fall even
though weren't summer
because recently I've been using a lot
of balloons and a lot of like really
pretty cool tones so right now I want to
use a little bit more of the warm tones
because warm is my favorite color I'm
gonna go in with a morphe 27 any
blending brush a fluffy one will work
fantastically for this I just love this
one personally because it's so soft it
picks up product beautifully and blends
beautifully as you can see very pretty
fluffy brush I'm gonna take the color
silk cream on a brush right here it's
already packed it on put this into the
Christian see how it works okay honestly
it's fucking stunning so first
impressions right now I'm never seen at
these shadows are blending so seamlessly
like truly so now I'm gonna go in oh my
god taste there's so many fucking shades
it's like crazy it's awesome okay now
I'm gonna go in with the shade butter
this is what it picks up like right here
take a much warmer version of SIL cream
set into the crease we're going to pile
it in and see how it blends with the
other shin dude this is why I love that
for suppressions is that like literally
I'm using the product and it's blending
seamlessly and you can see it on the
camera that it's blending so nicely
there's like no way to lie in this so
for all those bitches are gonna be like
oh my god you're fucking only saying
that because it's chocolate and she's
your friend and your morphe affiliate
like no actually uh the product just
applies beautifully and you can
literally see it on my eye and see how
pretty applies so for those people are
gonna come for me being like oh my god
you're biased because you're her friend
indebted I'm like honestly if I got the
palette was gonna be bad I wouldn't film
with it I'm a Thai person works like I
do will not talk shit about a
collaboration like I will not talk bad
about a cloud I think it's really bad
karma and I just can't because I've
collab and I know how much how much hard
work and how much heart and soul goes
into it I would be really devastated if
someone was like online a big youtuber
with online talking shit about my club
I'll just be like wow man like I thought
it was gonna be good you know so I never
talked bad about collabs I just won't
show them if I don't like them because
they're having clouds I've been that
have came out that I've been sent to me
that I just did not like at all
I just never talked about them I just
told myself like no I'm not gonna talk
about this because I'm not gonna ruin
their day I like talking shit about
collaborations is like taboo in the
beauty world like I will not do it
nope and say what you will about that I
really literally don't give a flying
fuck but I will not talk about
collaboration if I do
like it so the reason I'm even filming
this is cuz I thought I was going to
like it and honestly so far I'm so
pleased like truly I like these so far
I'm honestly really liking this more
than like normal morphe shadows like
these are better so far like they blend
so nicely there if they feel like butter
on the skin like truly they're fucking
sweet now I'm gonna take a little bit of
Roxanne and Jax which are both matte
shades as well they're very very very
warm I'm gonna put that into the crease
a little bit lower do you see that
fucking big me hey do you see that shit
like honestly with all the way into that
increase because I'm going to be doing a
gold lid anyway so is what we have so
far easy as fuck to blend I'm taking a
little bit of chip where's like a deep
chocolatey super super super deep
chocolatey Brown
sounds like a plumage Brown it's pretty
deep I'm going to Pat that in the outer
corner right now the corner right out
here
just really deepen everything out a
little bit I'm going for more of a smoky
sultry look so far I'm honestly so
impressed because I've only used the
mats and the mats have been absolutely
amazing very impressed so far stoked
about that so now I'm gonna take a
morphe emic - 10 inches to go really
easy flat just packing brush for shadow
and I'm gonna really pack on the shade
Queen which is the gold shade I've been
really wanting to put this on my lid so
bad I'm going to Y a little bit of it
for intense extra Ness because we all
know mommy's a little extra
the goal has a little bit of Fallout but
hey those hyper pigmented shades they
always have fallout so uh don't mind
that at all
look at that lid oh my god that is so
fucking pretty okay
next night and this is what we have so
far on the top of the lid and honestly
I'm blown away I'm so happy that it
turned out to be like what I wanted to
be I wanted it to be sickening I wanted
it to be amazing and truly I am so happy
that it is it's turning out to be
exactly what I was hoping it to be which
is sick nasty so now let's do the lower
lash line I'm going to do is very
similar to the top of the lash line and
take that same silk cream and butter and
run that underneath the lashes and I'm
using on that same morphe r39 brush
because I join into a quick easy blend
and then I'll focus it with smaller
brushes after I'm done with this
transition shade you can see I love the
rose gold collection from morphe they're
absolutely amazing this r39 brush is so
good if you need like a good dupe or I
got Mac 217
this is the bitch to do it with it's
like tapered white haired picks up
product really nice and it deposits very
very nicely so I'm gonna take a little
bit of more of a Jack's on a morphe 35o
win because I want to do a different
color there and now with that same brush
I used to pack on everything I'm gonna
take a be shade cran-apple which is a
really pretty intense foiled cranberry
shade I'm gonna put that right here
against that Jacks shade and I brighten
everything up a little bit more and now
for the inner corner we are going to
take in light which seems like a very
pretty highlight e-type shade on a
morphe m32 six perfect for packing on
the inner corner and a brow bone
highlight I'm going to highlight the
inner corner with this just give you a
night ooh that is just bright we're
gonna really just lightly pop that bad
bitch in look at the difference come on
and light and lighten my ass calm down
I'm gonna take a smidge a smidge onto
the brow bone taking Marc Jacobs
eyeliner in the shade rokoko
right waterline okay guys so we have the
eyes completely done and I am absolutely
in love with this look this is like
if I can do this every single day I
would but I'm trying to be different for
YouTube you know try to do like
different looks so I'm gonna go apply my
lashes and eyeliner off of camera and
I'll be right back so I went ahead I
applied some lashes and liner on for
camera and I put on a lip stick as well
this is a new summer collection from
Kylie in the shade and naked it's very
very pretty shade I love this fucking
nude into a good nude man like you know
I love a good Newt and of course I'm
wearing the Kim tie lion-hearted lashes
because these are maybe really looking
long this is the final look you guys
and that's at you guys that's it for the
entire video abuse had fun watching so
what is my final verdict on the palette
do I think it's worth it or not is a hit
or miss is it worth the price for the
palette and my honest true opinion is
that I do think that it's worth it I
think that the price point is fantastic
especially when you can use an
affiliates discount code to get you
another four dollars off basically the
palette for 35 custom branding shades
for 34 bucks I think that is unearthly I
think it's fantastic and I can't really
tell the difference between this palette
and a normal morphe palette
I love normal morphe palettes I really
truly do I think that they work
fantastically but this one I like even
more the textures are even better and I
was like wow they really really fucking
stepped their shit up like they were not
kidding when they said they were really
stepping it up for this palette and I
completely completely agree I think the
eye turned out to be so freakin pretty
and honestly you guys if you guys have
the money how definitely check it out
you guys want it buy it I think it's
gonna sell pretty quickly because this
palette is fire as always I'll leave
everything I use in tanks video
basically just the brushes linked down
below and yeah I think that's it for me
I'm gonna head out to my event right now
I gotta go to a dinner really quickly as
always have a great use of the night or
day wherever you guys are and I will
catch you guys in my next video bye you
