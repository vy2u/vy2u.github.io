so as you can see today I'm not wearing
a hat so as you guys know I did get her
surgery we still need a couple months
back and my hair's not at the point of
obviously where I want it to be yep I'm
so tired of wearing hats to put so much
topics in my hair so you can't really
tell that it's looking a little funky
right now it definitely does you guys
I'm so excited to create this video
because yesterday I got this bad bitch
I'm so so so time this is Geoffrey stars
and drogyny palette this is his newest
palette that's coming out very very very
soon ten shades in it and I believe it's
in retail for $45 seven mattes three
shimmer shades I saw this palette and I
just thought dude it was making my like
brain wanna create something more fun
and not so neutral like I usually do so
you guys I hope you guys enjoy this look
I think it's so pretty and I'm
so proud of you Jeffrey for creating
this palette palette is absolutely
amazing I think I like this one more
than the beauty color palette this is
just my kind of shades these are my kind
of tones and I'm so so so impressed with
the pigmentation and just the quality of
the shades I'm like dude dude honestly
like mMmmm like they're
pigmented as tits like literally I just
wiped it off as always if you guys
talking this video if you guys do like
me please don't watch it you
know the drill with that I say it every
single video and I say because people
still seem to want to watch my videos
and just hate watch me and leave
comments are just nasty and I'm
like dude honestly you will be so much
happier as a person if you don't watch
this video if you don't like me not
everyone to like me and it's all good I
don't mind but why spend time hating
someone when you can be sending time
loving something else from someone else
so if I'm not your cup of tea
go watch someone that is and leave them
positivity you know I'm saying that's
just what I wanted to say before and I
say in every single video don't watch me
if you don't like me but you guys do
like me please like this video click
like click it and subscribe to my
channel if you want already and if
you're new what's up at mani MUA and
welcome to my channel thank you so much
for being here
I really appreciate it yeah that's going
into this really pretty aqua purple look
hey guys okay cool so let's go and start
on today's video or at least as I look
already finished the face off camera
because I am going an event and I am
kind of pressed for time
Oh a little pressed so I decided I
really wanted to film it with the
jeffree star cosmetics and drogyny
palette I later just got this yesterday
from Jeffrey and I was like dude I want
to play with this social so bad i watch
a swatch video dude I knew about this
palette for like month month months that
I've been swatching along the way and I
just love that the palette and the color
scheme so much and this is what it looks
like right here it just is a pretty
palette and there's so many mattes in
here which is why I like it so much and
when there's palettes like this that
come out that are just nice and pretty
in the cut the pan size I die I feel
like the creative juices are flowing and
I want to do something with this palette
so I'm gonna take the shade charm first
I'm gonna take that on a new brush from
morphe this is the morphe m57 6 it's
like a really fluffy
just fluff brush dab right into a color
like slightly because they're very very
pigmented as you can see I'm like scared
of getting over pigmentation I don't do
this and I'm gonna run that to the
crease my eyes are already primed by the
way I'm using the mirror that comes with
the palette because it comes with the
mirror this bad bitch in this bad bitch
is the first time I'm using this palette
and as you can see holy burry it gets
more pigmented I thought it was gonna be
whoa
and this color is a very pretty like
mustardy hmm it's like a mustard orange
color as you can see a very small amount
goes a very long way I don't want to
over saturate this because I won't have
different colors in the crease but
damage is made when divided ok now we're
really taking that color all the way in
to the brow bone because I want them
really make sure we got a lot of eye
space today oh my god you scared me dad
so now we take a morphe and 4 3 3 and we
take the shade and drogyny and fetish
and mix those two together oh my god or
a pigmented okay
I'm gonna put that into the crease and
that's gonna go a little bit lower than
we have that charm shade first and I'm
gonna be putting that I'm gonna start
layering that color in here I wanna have
a really pretty like warm emetic the end
all the way to my inner crease and
really build out that crease well my
eyes open to see where I want to stop
the crease and where I wanted to
continue I'm gonna pull it out a little
bit here as well the game morphe and
five seven three letting out that one
I'm really pretty blown out like
purpley maroon crease I dipped a little
bit back into charm and I put
a little bit right here at the front
part of my eye and then blended it above
fetish and then drogyny just to make
sure the blend was seamless these
shadows been up so nicely guys they're
extremely pigmented though so you have
to be careful don't over dip into the
product because they are extremely
extremely pigmented and if you over dip
you're going to kind of ruin the eye
really it will it will ruin it when you
put down too much product because the
product has nowhere else to go so make
sure you're careful on not adding too
much product okay I'll be fantastic so
this is what you look like so far I have
the pretty and drogyny and fetish in the
crease with charm of course a little bit
higher than that and blend it out to
perfection so I'm thinking on the lid I
want to do poison so we're gonna grab
the shade poison which I got really
pretty like greenish aqua color I'm
gonna Pat down to a brush I'm gonna take
it on a more fat you 32 I'm gonna put
that all over the lid got a little
nugget of fallout though guys so just
make sure that you're packing and
pressing the shadow on it's an extremely
extremely extremely pigmented shade you
got to be careful because those ones
tend to fall out more I'll take that all
the way up to the crease I'm going to
blend it out so that way I poison down
I'm gonna go and blend it out with a
morphe m57 4 and I'm take a little bit
more fetish on a pencil brush I'm going
to really run that into the crease
between poison and the creasing right
there
I'm gonna go back in with poison because
when I blended that shade kind of got
off the lid a little bit so you want to
make sure that you go back in with the
shade after you blend okay why does this
look so cool okay I love
it honestly so now we're gonna focus on
the bottom lash light I'm gonna just
same thing I did on the top in the
crease I'm gonna keep it really really
warm and just really pretty maybe take a
little bit on Nate Rix - I'm feeling
best in so go and take a little bit of
charm first we're gonna run that in the
lower lash line guys literally we're
gonna do the exact same thing that we
did on the top we're gonna do on the
bottom I feel like a tropical bird
honestly and I am not mad at it at all
so now we're gonna start adding the warm
battle-worn we're gonna take a little
bit of edge Raja knee and finish again
I'm gonna run that with a morphe 43 on
the lower lash line blend that out of
here awesome and now I'm gonna take a
little bit of dominatrix which is I
really pretty dark chocolatey Brown and
that's gonna go even closer the lashline
more so on the outer corner and running
that in so for the waterline I think I'm
gonna do this color by color crop in the
shade Zoll Zulu I like this really
pretty aqua intense color and I think
it's gonna go really pretty on the lower
lash line
that's sick that looks soon
okay cool I'm gonna go ahead and do my
mascara and liner off of camera and I'll
be right back okay guys this is the
final look I decided to put my lashes
and mascara and lip off of camera let me
see what turned out to be also before I
forget I added Mac vanilla pigment on
the inner corner of my eye and on the
brow bone just give me a little bit of
shine nothing too crazy nothing to him
not like my highlight but I wanted to
add a little bit of shine to the look
and this is what it turned out to be I
hope you guys enjoyed this look I think
it's absolutely beautiful and yeah guys
that's it for the entire video I hope
you guys had fun watching this I know
it's gonna be more of a fast video and I
didn't talk very very much because I was
really focused on blending and I
literally am going to invent which is
