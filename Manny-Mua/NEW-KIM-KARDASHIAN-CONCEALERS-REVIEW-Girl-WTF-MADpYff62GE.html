how you guys doing it's been a minute
since I have filmed I always say that
but it is true because I pre film
eyelash cuz I get busy and I know it
looks like i nap a lot because I do it's
because I do you know
so it takes video I'm really really
excited to be doing this video because
it is going to be a review on the new
keiki W Kim kardashian-west Beauty
concealers actually have the box around
here this is the PR package I was sent
this is the box this is what we have in
the box
holy shake so that's why I already have
my base on because I'm gonna be doing a
full review on a big concealer the
under-eye powders both of them and the
brushes that it comes with so I so I
already have my base on I have
foundation on we look snatch with the
honey we do I'm sorry it's done I look
stunning and I'm actually going to an
event tonight so I'm going to be doing a
wear test as well I'm gonna be putting
on my makeup right now going to the
events I'm going to come back later on
I'm gonna check in and see how
everything looks on the eyes after I'm
done so I'm gonna be - not only am i
doing a full review and demo I'm going
to be doing a wear test as well to see
how it looks on the skin and before I
even start this video before I even
start talking about this I wanted to
bring up this thing because I feel like
I had to bring it up in every
video I do about Kylie Jenner or Kim
kardashian-west beauty products it's so
frustrating basically I feel like with
these kind of videos I can never win
it's either I guess in the product for
free so I'm gonna say it's amazing and
I'm getting paid for it which I'm
not I get sent products from every
 brand so because it's sent to me
by camera Kylie are there two their
team's 9ui them by their teams doesn't
mean I'm gonna say it's so good you know
I mean but I'm also not gonna be an
asshole because it's them either so it's
like one of those things and I feel like
people always come for me if I say that
the product is bad the only thing it's
bad because it's Kylene it's Kim and
you're gonna get views bitch you can't
win you can't win at the end of the day
honestly it doesn't really
matter to me I really don't give a
flying I just want to disclose that
because at the end of the day all that
really matters is that I'm truthful
about the products that are sent to me
and that's that I'm not gonna be doing
no where I'm saying that
the product is amazing and I don't like
it I hope you guys would trust me enough
that I'm going to be telling my true
honest opinion but the product is what
matters and that's why I'm gonna review
I'm not reviewing ethical Ness of the
brand's I'm reviewing the
product in my hands so that is
why I do the reviews I do always just
comes down to Oh II was being Kylie in
Kim's products that people love to like
come for me about and I'm like you know
what I don't give a flying anymore
I don't even care because at the end of
the day I'm being honest and I'm being
true to who I am and I'm
telling how I honestly feel and that
makes me happy and that's all that
really matters to me as long as I'm
being honest to myself and being honest
to you guys so hope you guys understand
that and for all those that want to just
like no like you know typing keyboard
warriors leave it in the basement bitch
go jerk off into your hand I don't know
what you guys do anyway you guys as
always if you guys don't like this video
if you guys don't like me please don't
 watching Taleggio with that I
just expressed that right now but if you
guys do like this video please go ahead
and click subscribe to my channel click
like if you guys liked it and you don't
go right into this for view and demo
using the new k'kaw beauty concealers
and I'm quite excited to try these okay
so let's get into this so actually the
package came with these two guys which
is really cool and with the basically an
instruction manual and it came with a
little like kind of demo how-to on this
cute little cartoon of Kim getting her
makeup done I really really really like
that it shows conceal bacon brighten
that's what the kid is basically what it
is guys it's a three-step process
basically this is what Mario and Kim do
together this is what they have
perfected to do you know Mario is Kim's
makeup artist and this is the kind of
like routine that they do this is what
they always do they always do concealer
bake it and they brighten it and
afterwards
so this is kind of like their method and
they're bringing to eyes we have the
concealers which are full coverage
liquid concealers was ultra creamy
hydrating formula perfect for correcting
and highlighting and perfect for
everyday use alone or in conjunction
with the baking and brining powders we
have the baking powder which is a
lightweight non-drying a velvety powder
formula that creates a soft diffused
finish and there's a for universal
translucent shades amazing and we have
the brightening powder which is the
silky pressed powder infused with fine
brightening pearls which add radiance
under the eyes and help to create a
fresh and awakened luck sounds great it
sounds like exactly what I need to have
underneath these so it also comes with
details about the actual product so we
have the bundle the bundle itself it's
$80 so that's like a high price point
okay that's $80 and hefty it comes with
a concealer a baking powder a
brightening powder and brush the brushes
the concealer itself is $18 concealer
brush one and concealer brush to our $18
the baking powders are $18 and the
brightening powder is $18 if you bought
all of them separately it would retail
for $90 but the kids are sold for 80 so
saving $10 and in dove
Julie I do think honestly for $18 for a
concealer I think that's super super
fair because usually you like higher-end
concealers retail around 24 to 30 bucks
so I think that's that's a really nice
price point honestly like when you look
at it separately it sounds really quite
great I think that sounds great this is
my personal opinion though I feel like
if these were retailed like $25 each I'd
be a little more like mm-hmm
by picking another $18 I'm like okay so
I'm gonna go ahead and grab from the
lightest set here because I am a light
light girl that is light number four I
think I'm gonna use that one just for
now and we'll see if we can always
lighten it as we go but I think for for
now we'll be good then we're gonna take
bake number one and we're gonna take
brighten number one and also let's just
auch about the packaging I personally
think this is so cute like I
love the fact that it's like basic is
the wrong word mmm basic the right word
it's not for some reasons the basic
sounds of mean but I do mean it in like
the nicest way possible I feel like it's
basic but like beautifully done it's
like a beautiful basic you know it's not
like a basic where you're like oh really
that you don't put any work into it you
don't mean effort I feel like these
components like are quite beautifully
done you know what I mean like I feel
like it's basic in a good way not basic
and like a did you spend any money on it
bitch kind of way you know so we got the
two brushes right here we have the
concealer the baking powder and we have
the burning power so this is basically
one kit this is one kit right here
it's beautiful is one kit right there
before I even start putting it on really
quickly one more thing let me do a quick
comparison of the Tarte concealer amount
wise compared to the k'kaw Beauty amount
wise this is like war we're gonna get a
little bit more intense in the review
concealers from Tarte the shape tube
concealers contain 0.33 8 fluid ounces
right Kim kardashian-west concealers
contain point one six two ounces this is
about half the amount that comes in a
Tarte shape tape that can be a big thing
for some people like it can be a big
deterrent you know what I mean like it
is a lot less a product that's literally
almost half so tart shape tape concealer
retails for $27 the Kim kardashian-west
one retails for 18 there's double the
product in here less product in here so
it's one of those things works like if
you aren't more on a budget I want to
try concealer that's not as expensive
but still gonna be higher end we'll see
I mean who knows I'm I hate it what I
decided to do I'm gonna go and follow
the instructions I'm gonna use this
brush for one side of the face and I'm
gonna use a morphe Beauty sponge on the
other side of the face you've got my
name Ewing plug man you don't plug your
code like dye you're such a brat
we're going in oh my gosh we're sorry my
face is not set by the way it looked
just as phonation on it doesn't smell
like literally anything to me
I have no scent I don't smell like
I literally don't smell anything
which is nice I would rather it so like
nothing that's like paint let's go ahead
and go right in taking shade number four
light so far it glides on extremely
nicely it's kind of cold it goes golden
the bees try the other side
I'd like one dunk is all you need cuz I
was like that kind of double foot
applicator putting it on is actually a
much creamier thicker texture than I
expected I thought it was gonna be a
little more liquidy but it's definitely
not it's definitely thick consistency I
watched a Mario do it with the brush so
I'm gonna try it with the brush the
brush it came with okay great so I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna do the concealer
brush for one side of the face I'm gonna
use a sponge for the other because I
naturally use a sponge so I really want
to give it like a fair shot for what I
normally do so I'm gonna take this side
with the Beauty Blender and I'm gonna
blend this out and see what we think
holy okay cool so so far it blended
in literally seconds
I'm gagged well we're gonna go and take
this brush to blend out the concealer on
this sign well I think you make Lycos
really strong line down the center of it
I'm not really a brush blender kind of
person like I like to use sponges I
honestly like using the brush it's just
not my cup of tea it's not how I
normally do makeup so I feel like it's
not fair for me to review it that way so
I'm gonna use it the way I know how to
use makeup and for me this is what works
but honestly I will say that this is a
full-coverage formula like I don't see
any like bitch she's full coverage I
don't see any kind of blue hues or
anything underneath my eyes y'all she's
full you guys honestly the blend was so
seamless I'm not even kidding it blended
beautifully it's not creasing quickly on
me I don't see a lot of creasing
happening quick I'm a very quick creaser
as you guys know I crease like a mofo
I'm gonna take a little bit of shade
number two just just a bit I just want a
brighter I'll just give me I'm not doing
much and it literally just like blends
away beautifully it keeps the coverage
and keeps the color it's bright and it
doesn't sit to your skin it's not like
heavy feeling it doesn't feel very heavy
on the skin not to sound like a bitch
but I'm really pleasantly surprised
like I'm really pleasantly surprised
okay great so now that we
have that done I think the concealer
actually looks beautiful I mean the
formula of the concealer almost has a
satin luminous finish can I see that I
can i concealer I need my eye there's
like a glow to it and as you can see
there's not any major creasing happening
so far and I haven't even set yet so
that's really great so now let's go
ahead and go right in to the baking
powder which has a net weight of 3.5
grams not a lot of product in here it's
definitely not a lot but it's 18 bucks I
hate starting powders like you guys are
talk about whereas like that little
safeguard on one side we're gonna apply
it with this little brush like it says
to do so this is how I saw Mario do it
so I am doing I said I'm gonna go ahead
and set the right side of my face with
the brush just lightly set it it's
dispersing very very nicely and sets the
under-eye really quite well this setting
powder almost gives you again a luminous
glowy finish as I'm feeling the powder
in my hand it is very velvety like this
oh my god it almost feels way
dude so right there we have it on and
now I'm gonna use the other side with
the sponge and see how it looks when
you're actually making with the powder
so we're gonna do that cuz a lot of
people like to actually bake with the
powder we're gonna put that underneath
here we're gonna bake it with our good
old trusty sponge as we can see we put a
lot more powder on that same side with
the brush less product side with sponge
much more product so we're also gonna
use this brush to apply the powder it's
set on the instructions so I'm gonna go
ahead and try a little bit of that the
pointy side of the brush that we can let
me just put underneath here underneath
this side we're gonna put it on that
side I would not use this actually blend
out the concealer personally it's just
not soft enough definitely it's great
for powder but for me I would rather
have like a really really soft berry
like squishy sponge for that so under
eyes are currently cooking in right now
I'm gonna go on set my face with our
translucent powder taking the laura
mercier right now so what didn't I just
applied some bronzer really quickly off
of camera just so I can get some bronzer
down I don't look so sickly now I like
snaps again this side of course we as
you can see it looks really nice it
looks really soft it's very diffused
underneath the eye this side so I was
powder there because that's the side
that we were baking on so this baking
powder has been on for about like what
like ten minutes now I'm gonna go ahead
and brush it off with this sponge the
other side of it what I do like about
this one right
cutter is I did not change the color of
anything nothing I was scared about cuz
you know some under-eye powders how they
can like cause you to get like some
discoloration I'm I this has not
happened and looks really pretty is I
feel like it looks very diffuse
underneath my eye last but not least we
have the brighten powder so this one
says using the fluffy brush end of
concealer brush number two I wish that
on the brushes assessed concealer brush
number one or concealer brush number two
think that would be really really
practical so we can see what it says
this one has nothing on it or you guys
anyway I'm gonna just assume that this
is concealer brush number two I'm pretty
sure it is oh yeah here we go this is
gonna help me take baking powder on
pointed sponge of concealer brush number
one haha so we're gonna take the brush
number two and the fluffy side of this
basic like a really large like an eye
shadow fluffy brush is basically what it
is now we're going to apply desired
amount of brining powder right in under
eye area use the rounded brush and if
didn't see the brush number two to apply
a more concentrated amount of
brightening powder to the inner corner
of the eye for ultimate brightness so
we're gonna go take brighten number one
which is this guy right here again also
retails for $18 the brightness powder
this is white tummy feeling it doesn't
feel as smooth as I thought it was going
to what's watchin on the skin it does
look very very brightening and just more
so illuminating so we're gonna put that
underneath does like really illuminate
oh
it toyota's I was like you're putting
some form of a highlighter underneath
the eyes to give you a really bright
appearance you guys see I'm saying like
okay look Lola do you see how now my
under-eye has almost like a sheen it
Olivia has a shimmer to it you can see
the powder like you can actually see
exactly where I place the powder because
it is so brightening this smaller brush
I hope without internet that's what it
looks like boom so it looks like a
really bright intense white satin'
definitely not matte because dude
oh it's mine you have so much of the mac
emphasized powder like when they sold a
shadow man this is under high you guys
so this is what we have so far I'm not
gonna brush away a little bit just I
feel like it's a little heavy underneath
the eye just I wanted to see what it
looks like just take a little brush and
just brush any you feel is a little too
much
okay cool I'm gonna go finish my makeup
off of camera really quickly and I'll be
right back I'll talk you through it what
we think how it's looking so far as I'm
continuing on with my makeup so I will
be okay guys I just finished up doing
all of my makeup this is the finish so
this is the final product
of this face this is what I'm
gonna wear tight to the event and this
is just what it is I just want to do a
really cute monochromatic look more so
like pink pink pink pink anyways you
guys so this is what it looks like the
concealer is still Honus looks beautiful
it looks very glowy
it looks like luminous underneath my
eyes I'm not gonna say oily just yet I
would say it looks more luminous I don't
see anything
oil eNOS I just feel like it is like
shiny in this area right here and I used
to get oily in those spots so I'm just
not gonna say that oils just yet cuz
it's only been about an hour and a half
we'll see how it wears throughout the
day I'm gonna give it a fair shot is the
Urban Decay all nighter this is what I
do with all my concealers and this is
what I do when I'm going out to events
oh I always do setting spray so I
thought would be helpful to show you
guys what the other shades of the
concealers look like just against my
pale ass arm okay you guys I wouldn't a
nice watch the first eight shades right
here can see that we have two shade one
two three four this is the shade I use
underneath my eyes and we have five six
seven eight we have it the brighten
powder right here in the shade number
one we have the brighten powder in the
shade number two this is much more of a
peachy pink brightening shade and this
is much more about white intense
under-eye so these are the first eight
shades right here have a really nice
like neutral one right here but a really
really peachy one right here which is
the one I ended up using number four and
I mix a little bit of two with it which
is more of a yellow tone one here we
have a really baby pink one right here a
lot of them are pretty similar we have
like a really really deep pink salmon
shade we were really intense Orange II
terracotta shade and we have to close
out a little bit more of the sand yellow
tone side so we like a mustard sugar
right there
okay guys and these are the second eight
of the shades right here we have nine
ten eleven twelve and we have the
brightening shade which is a yellow
banana powder type shade thirteen
fourteen fifteen sixteen of the deepest
complexions and this is more of a orange
e brightening powder from the deeper
deeper complexion so this is what the
last eight look like of the deeper
spectrum I just wanted to show you guys
what all the shades that look like
against my skin because I am very very
very fair I just want to show you guys
what it would look like just cigarettes
and see what kind of undertones will be
brought out because I do have a very
basically white base you can see
undertone on my skin type really really
really easily and here are the other
powder so this is number two this is
number three and this is number four
right here basically the baking powders
reflect a very hardcore the brightening
powder sub i SWA
the brightening powders you don't really
need to see a swatch of these guys
because it's basically reflecting the
exact same thing as what the other
powders were so I thought there's no
point in opening these and wasting these
guys because I they're not gonna be able
to work for my complexion if I do a
giveaway they will work out other
people's complexions so me just do a
quick little check in right now because
it's been a couple hours so far I have
to say I really really enjoy the
concealer under my eyes I think it looks
beautiful I think it blended out very
very nicely I really enjoyed the baking
powder and I enjoyed the brightening
powder so actually the whole thing
collectively is a big win for me when it
comes to the three actual makeup
products but when it comes to the
brushes I actually don't think you need
the brushes to accomplish that look like
this I think that the brushes are not
necessary I think that if you guys just
bought the concealer the under eye
baking powder and the brightening powder
you would be very very very happy I
don't think you need them if you have a
beauty sponge you'll be just flying off
with just that you don't need to use the
two brushes to go with it to make it
work if you guys are type of people that
like to save on a kit and you want to
buy the whole kit will you get uses out
of the brushes yes for sure I did end up
using them I really did like this one a
lot I think this brush is really really
great the other one was Q it's just not
my cup of tea top my style as much I
would say you would be very happy with
the bundle so far I can't really say yet
because I haven't done to check in yet a
couple hours from now to see what
everything looks like but so far so good
I'm really really enjoying the concealer
the baking powder and the brightening
powder I think it looks beautiful on the
skin I keep looking at myself in the
viewfinder and I keep looking myself in
the mirror on my damn bitch like you
look sickening the under eye looks great
I think it looks very beautifully
diffused it just looks a little bit more
of a setting powder just absorb some oil
and work but doesn't give me it like a
heavy finish just cuz you make a little
bit of a set but not be too heavy so I'm
gonna leave now I'm gonna go get ready
and then leave and then I will be back
to let you guys know what we thought of
this concealer but so far I'm saying
that it is a hit so far hello you guys
what is up it is currently what time is
it right now it is 141 a.m. so I've had
this makeup since about 6 o'clock at
night so that means it's been on for
about almost eight hours now and this is
what it looks like of course I am
 oily I've been doing this
throughout the night so like I haven't
like knocked off pieces of my foundation
and things like that and I obviously
need to be blotted like badly but the
concealer that's what this video is
about the concealer I honest you guys I
think it still looks really pretty like
it just it stayed
like it has stayed throughout the entire
night it's worn a little bit like don't
get me wrong it's been almost eight
hours on and it's definitely worn a
little bit like my face like at the top
of my forehead is pretty for sure
and I was like a little bit of cracking
right here it's a little bit less
product right here a little bit of
separation going on this site has a lot
less separation going on actually
because I've been slapping a lot tonight
like it's been falling into my lap lines
a bit but every concealer does that with
me so I don't have something to warrant
part of the review I'm really oily I
don't think that this is concealer does
anything for like if you're an oily
person like it'll definitely your oils
will definitely see do pretty quickly I
would actually say use that same
blotting powder and blot away any excess
oil honestly guys I'm actually very
pleasantly surprised as I said earlier
about this concealer I think it worked
very very very very well and I'm just
kind of like bitch like yes like yes
miss Kim she did that and I'm
actually really really happy to say that
I this is 100% Manning anyway approved
it's a total hit for me I think that the
concealer consistency is very thick it's
very impress you such a beautiful amount
of coverage it's spread like butter it
was really really really nice the baking
powder was really nice silky lightweight
set beautifully and brighten my eyes
before I even like use of brightening
set the brightener definitely brighten
my eyes like my under eyes were so
bright like Nikita even like putting it
out to me cuz I was with her tonight she
was like bitch your under eyes look so
bright in a Mayan honestly for me the
whole thing is a complete win other than
the brushes I'm not a huge fan of the
brushes that's just me personally I
don't think that you need them all I
would say is it's for to complete this
look all you really need is the
concealer the under-eye powder and the
brighten powder the brushes I would say
that you don't really need them
necessarily that's a sales video is you
guys I honestly just really really thick
concealer it just looked beautiful I
love you guys so much okay so the night
or day where you guys are and I will
catch you guys in my next video bye guys
