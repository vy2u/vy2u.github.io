today's video is going to be another
highly asked requested review video
recently I got my hands on the entire
Kylie cosmetics birthday collection this
is the entire collection right here yeah
it's not going on I actually think it's
really cute I love that it's all pink
soft think that's why have a pink
background today because I was feeling
like Kylie oh you know I was really
feeling them so yeah you guys that's
what today's video is going to be I'm
going to be reviewing the entire
birthday collection from Kylie cosmetics
and I'm just really excited to try this
out because I really liked her vacation
collection I thought that vacation
collection which I think was her most
recent one had really really really
staple sickening ass items and like I
always say just because I'm sent a
product from a brand and does not mean
that I'm going to be biased or not as
honest just because the product was sent
to me either way if the products are
great I will say they're great and if
they're not I will say they're not so
that's just my two cents I like to
disclose that in every video just
because I am sent a product does not
mean that I'm going to be biased and be
like I'm in favor of the brand because
they are thin to me no it's not how it
works that's just not how it works for
me and I know a lot of people are like
that
that's their lane that's what they want
to do that's fine I guess but from even
from my audience I'm going to always
keep it 100% truthful with you guys
because that's how I'm em and that's how
I'm going to continue to stay so as
always if you guys don't like this video
if you guys do not like me please don't
fucking watch it you know the German
thing but if you guys do like this video
please subscribe to my channel if you're
not already and if we knew what's up I'm
Manny MUA and welcome to my channel
thank you so much for being here I
really really appreciate it but yeah
it's gonna get to this Kylie cosmetics
birthday collection review video
okay so first things first I'm going to
be using this guy this is the I want a
tall pallet here we have these shadows
right here this reminds you so much of
like when I was like in elementary
school and like the girls would have
really really cute like little journals
had like pink glitter on it and it'll
just like very like girly very very like
elementary school ish like it just
rising so much of what I was like a
little kid in general just Minds me like
when I was a child and my childhood so
this guy retails for $54 it comes with a
blush a highlighter and it comes with
nine eyes shadows each Shadow has 1.4
grams of product and the blush has nine
point five grams and the highlighter has
seven point five grams so I think that
there is definitely a good hefty amount
of product in here so it is fifty four
dollars it's not a cheaper palette by
any means I think that the four is
actually kind of pricey for nine shades
and a blush and a highlighter so we're
going to try it out
also Kylie's collection came with
brushes which i think is like one of the
first time is she came out with separate
brushes and a collection they do feel
soft the brushes are $30 for the set of
four I think that's very pricey for four
fucking brushes I'm like oh I think that
the brushes are a little bit too pricy
for what you're actually getting they
feel very very cheap very very
lightweight they just do they don't feel
very heavy or luxurious I mean I have
more few ones that feels so much better
than this by far and not nearly as
expensive but they do feel soft we're
gonna take the blush Cheers right here
with the brush so not much product is
getting picked up okay let's go and use
the blush oh my gosh first item
the brush on the face it feels a little
bit rough actually it doesn't feel as
soft as I thought it was going to feel
yeah it feels a little bit bristly for
sure but the color of this blush
I think is fucking stunning and it's
actually looking really nice - my face
is bloody hell right really pretty
okay also the cool thing about this
blush color I feel like it would work on
a lot of different skin tones now let's
go ahead and highlight with the shade
confetti where I take on a morphe and
5/10 see how it works
okay so that effect is definitely there
it's definitely highlighted and pretty
this highlighter though it sits on top
of the skin it's not a highlighter
that's really like finely milled and
soft this is definitely more of a chunky
consistency and has little tiny flecks
of glitter in it the color itself is
stunning it definitely definitely is I'm
gonna swatch it beautiful beautiful
shade there is little flecks of glitter
in it and it is a little bit of a
thicker consistency a little bit more
powdery but it looks really nice so I'm
happy about
now we're gonna highlight the other side
of the cheek with one of these and these
are the new high degenerate loose powder
highlighters in the shade Queen and the
king so these are the ultra clothes and
they retail for $14 each which is not
too bad at all actually this is what
they look like it's a really really
small container like like really really
small maybe $14 a little bit high for
the amount of product you can name here
you get 4 grams so so we have this shade
Queen right here I just watched it on my
finger okay so this one is actually much
much much glittery err than the first
shade this is like straight-up body
glitter this is not like a highlighter
by any means and if you're into that
great that's awesome I'm not so much
into that really as much and here we
have King that's gonna swatch that one
next to Queen so we got King right here
woah so I definitely would say that I
like the shade King more than I like the
shade Queen I feel like it's not nearly
as a glittery and it's a lot more finely
milled than the other one is to be
honest so I'm gonna take the shade King
Matson to go on the other side of them
so let's take the shade
oh my fuckin Vuitton oh my fuckin bottle
the shit King is everything right on
these guys Queen is a miss for me King
is a hit for me so I don't that helps
you guys out but I would say Queen no
King yes also another thing that is a
miss for me are the brushes I do not
think that these four brushes are worth
the price for brushes for 30 bucks
I just don't think these are put
together very well they loose form so
quick look at that one that one wasn't
like the box and that's like fucked so
now let's go and move on to the eyes I'm
gonna do it really just natural pretty
look because I feel like if you're
buying this palette it is much more of a
natural pretty palettes I'm gonna do a
more of a natural pretty look with this
I don't like to think that it looks a
little bit similar to the Valentine's
collection don't get me wrong I look at
this and I'm like I literally are not he
first thought valentines collection when
I saw it I was like so we're gonna take
buttercream frosting on a morphe e 20 7
which is ice I gave fluffy blending
brush when we take you right here and
we're gonna take a little bit party time
which they more soft a docile dusty pink
and that's going to a crease
they are dusty but they're not too dusty
where I'm like overwhelmed like other
palettes I've tried recently it's
blending out really easily it's applying
very nicely I'm not mad at it so I'm
gonna take the shade 1942 on in more
feet are 39 there's a nice easy blending
brush and I'll put that into the crease
I feel like Kylie must have changed up
her formula on her mattes because I feel
like they've gotten a lot better since
she first came out with shadows okay can
you guys see this I feel like you guys
must be able to see this like it just
blends so easily and they feel so soft
I'm gonna take the shade of birthday
girl and this is gonna go on to my lid
on the morphe m to 10 it picked up very
nicely it's not too powdery it picks up
nice someone put that onto the lid right
here this is definitely a really just
pretty average champagne shadow with me
go and swatch anything here this is what
it looks like on the finger it's a very
really pretty satin finish it's not
metallic by any means it's just a shiny
shimmery shade it's right here it
reminds me a lot of actually the
highlighter in this palette because it
does have a little flecks of glitter in
it so if you guys are into shadows have
a little bit of glitter in it they'll
give you something that a nice pretty
of champagne color you might be really
into this I'm usually really really into
metallic shades on the eyes like I want
more popping than this but hey it's not
bad at all it's not bad at all it looks
really nice for a nice satin shade there
is quite some fallout in this shadow and
I think it's because of all the little
glitter flakes that are in it so
definitely suggest packing on intensely
very much pack on do not swipe on the
lid at all
pack pack pack we are just moving on a
lot of guys we are doing quite well I'm
gonna take the shade midnight and I
wanna take that on a morphing on four to
five and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
smoke out in my liner mm-hmm right here
guys right there I'm gonna take that and
do a nice like shadowing or into a
shadowing oh I love sing shadowing the
black is pretty pigmented it's not like
holy fuck pigmented but it's definitely
pigmented enough but you can definitely
layer it to get full opacity black ain't
gone you okay I'm much more pressing I
thought was gonna be honestly as I hate
to say mmm it's going to swatch the
black on our finger and it's fucking
black oh okay let's see it's definitely
I mean it's definitely black it's not
like the blackest black I've ever used
ever I think that this block is better
than the black that she had in a
different palette I don't know what pot
was I don't remember but this black is
definitely more pigmented and I would
definitely it's a little bit deeper than
the black before for group for sure
what I like about doing shadow wings I
just like they don't have to be perfect
at all they can just be like they can
just be do I don't know creature they're
just like this cute little like
fluttering moment we're just like oh but
it's a shadow it's not that big of a
deal if it's uneven you know now I'm
gonna take the shade new year new me
we're gonna take it on that you 36 and
really we're gonna put that underneath
the lash line right here on the outer
corner
oh she's pigmented oh that's such a
beautiful color
eh I'm God I am fucking not and the
shades one of those really intense
metallic foil shades let's swatch it on
the hand yeah it's one of those shades
it's one of those foiled metallic
intense ones which I very very much
enjoy I think it looks really pretty on
the eyes I think it actually is very
pigmented I'm thinking let's just take
the pink and let's put that on the inner
part of the eye very very very pretty
hot pink yeah okay oh that's more pink
than I thought it was gonna be so
therefore I need to blend
okay I'm gonna quickly put on some
lashes and mascara and I will be right
back and there we have it - guys we have
the final I look completely done and
this is what we have so far I actually
really like the look I really really
really liked it last step I'm going to
be highlighting and taking that birthday
girl shade again with the Kylie brush
the flat shader one I'm going to
highlight the brow bone so this brush it
totally works it works fine it's not
like one of those brushes where it's
like revolutionary it doesn't feel very
great but it picks up the product nicely
and it deposits the product nicely so if
you guys are a fan of Kylie and you guys
want to try the brushes go ahead and
check them out what I said earlier still
stands I think that the four brushes are
not worth $30 but hey your opinion can
be different from mine so yeah so now
let's go and do the verdict on this
palette what do I think about it I think
that this palette actually worked
totally great like I literally have no
problems with it whatsoever all the
shadows
blended very nicely the look is really
really seamless the colors are very very
pigmented like I'm actually like I had
nothing back to say about this palette
whatsoever other than the price point do
I think that this palette is worth fifty
four bucks honestly I don't know this is
one of those things where it's like what
I personally buy this if I saw this
would I buy it like oh I need to have it
I probably wouldn't but if you are a
huge Kylie fan and you love Kylie
cosmetics and you want just have as a
collector's item I would definitely
suggest buying it the shadows work
beautifully I think everything looks
really really nice it's very very
seamless so is this a hit or a Miss for
me this one is actually a tit I think
the product will work very nicely I
thought the bush worked nicely
the highlighter worked great that all
the shadows worked great so we have some
lip products now when I say some I mean
a fucking flat on who needs as many of
the things I don't know so first we have
it the cute little Kylie Jenner Velvets
liquid lipstick mini collection and it
comes with six velvet liquid lipsticks I
believe that both of the mini sets are
$36 that's what they retail I think the
packaging is really cute it's very
Valentine's Day again and I like that
it's like a very pretty nude rips it
reminds me a lot of the Kim Kardashian
collection what does she did the lip
creams this reminds me a lot of the lip
creams for sure so if it lips I'm gonna
take the shade commando I think that her
velvet liquid lipsticks are so fucking
nice I actually really really really
like them they last nicely and they feel
really good on the lips they're not too
drying okay
and there she never did what the fuck so
we have commando right here this is the
chic commando feels great looks really
really pretty thing the course
stunning oh my god it feels very pretty
on the lips now let's do one of the
bright shades of The Velvet liquid
lipsticks we're gonna take these shade
surprise me and this is a really intense
bright ass hot pink Wow yep this one's a
little bit stickier than the nude is but
usually with these I come to realize as
I try more and more and more makeup the
bright shades like this I don't think
any brand will ever come out with a
bright shade like this that's not gonna
be a little bit streaky
I really don't and once you like do this
mm-hmm the stickiness goes away and
because it's not a matte matte lipstick
it's not gonna dry in weird spots to
make it look even more patchy so that is
a go so now I'm gonna go ahead and
insert all of these swatches on my arm
of the velvet liquid lipstick so you
guys can see exactly how they swatch and
see what they look like on skin so here
we have the shade la so we get with just
one so yes I have fucking hairy arms I'm
a fucking man let me live next we have
the shade party girl one swipe very
pigmented right away this is a really
fucking pretty shade holy shit next we
have birthday suit one swipe very ultra
pigmented again nice just like the other
shades were now we have the shade
sprinkle this one is slightly slightly
more patchy than the other shades are
but still very nice coverage next we
have the shade commando right there very
nice full coverage and last but not
least we have surprise me which is this
shade right here
and these are the six from the minis so
for those guys are they hit or are they
amiss I would actually say that they're
a hit I think that they're really cute I
think the clothes are really pretty and
I also very much like the velvet liquid
lipstick formulas so for those they are
definitely a hit and I would definitely
pay thirty-six bucks for the six shades
it's like five bucks a mini thing that's
cute it sounds you bad so um yeah I'm
down for the minis of the Velvets
specifically so now I wouldn't go ahead
and go into it via glosses now we got
some glosses
we got the shade cherry piling of the
shade cupcake so we have cupcake oh here
it's more of a nude very pretty brave
looking coverage oh my god
that's done and now we have the shade
cherry pie full cover just fuck again
probably has good causes I'm putting on
a cupcake right now and they're so
smooth feeling - shit oh I live for
cupcake cupcake I'm living gasping
breathing and living for it much are
these each glass is at $15 and they feel
very smooth on the lips they're not
sticky whatsoever they're nice and full
coverage so both of them are a hit for
sure
I like cupcake a lot more than I like
cherry pie I just like I wouldn't really
wear this kind of shade as a gloss
specifically so um definitely both of
them are a hit they're both are really
nice both full coverage they look really
nice and they feel very very nice on the
lips too so definitely that is a go so
next we have the lip kit in the shade
2020 I'm something that's a little
cheese turning I'm gonna and this is
what it looks like actually really like
the packaging anything it's so cute it's
like just all nude and light pink and of
course they live kids retail for $30 so
we're gonna take the shade 20 lip liner
which is a really pretty like
I don't know how many swatches code yet
to notice let's see on the hand okay
okay it's a straighter Bessy muff that's
what that is
I love Kelly's lip liners to you by the
way those are like one right here things
actually does they thinks she doesn't
very well
okay so let's go in with 20 liquid to
matte lipstick
this Shay is nice and full coverage it
is not streaky whatsoever let's see how
it looks when it dries down and this is
what the color looks like once it's dry
again it is full coverage very dry
uh-huh it is dry on my lips it's
probably not gonna be coming off for a
minute I think I'm just keep this
lipstick on for the rest of the video
because that's gonna fucking mean here
and I keep trying to take this out my
mouth is already burning if you are a
fan of Kylie cosmetics liquid lipstick -
matte formula then I think you're gonna
really really really enjoy it 20 I'm not
a huge fan of her look-alike formula I
think it's a little bit too drying for
me personally so for me personally it's
a Miss but if you guys liked her formula
that I think you guys are going to love
it and it will be a definite hit for you
for sure and last but not least we are
down to the last thing we have the matte
liquid lipstick minis so this is the
shade one wish that is such a pretty
like soft rose pink nice and full
coverage there's no stickiness
whatsoever
next got the shade baby girl another
shade that's nice and full coverage does
not give you any stickiness very cool
very cool next we have the shade angel
right here which is a really dark rosy
pink it's actually pretty similar to
this shade over here next to the shade
August bug right here whoa this one is a
little bit streaky I can see some skin
peeking through that's definitely not
has full coverage as the other shades
are on my arm but this one is still a
very pretty color and I'm sure once it's
dried down it would look really nice
next we have the shade all nighter right
here wow that's a fucking bright shade
holy shit right here this is another one
of those shades that's a little bit
trickier this one reminds me a lot of
that August bug where it's a little bit
streaky I can see my skin peeking
through underneath it once it's layered
you come sure you can definitely get oh
fuck that's a shit yes watch bear with
me okay I'm not a good swatch sure and
last but certainly not least we have the
shade gorge right here and this is what
it looks like this is okay so this one
is technically the streakiest of them
all I don't you guys couldn't tell with
the lighting but there's definitely a
lot of skin peeking through especially
towards the top right here this is more
deadly need to be layered two or three
times to get full opacity as
see it's definitely definitely streaky
you just like how that one is and that
one is these two these three are pretty
good these three are pretty streaky so
here we have the shades are basically
completely dried out um this one as its
drying isn't gotten a little bit
stickier if you guys can see it but
there's a little bit more streakiness
and this one these two are pretty good
um this one is the most tricky of all
that one's pretty streaky as well and
this one is actually a little bit tricky
as well okay guys so are they little
minis of the liquid to matte lipsticks a
hit or miss for me they are more of a
miss I feel like there is shades that
are a little bit too streaking here you
can definitely make them work though if
you bought them you can definitely make
them worth it just layer a couple of
shades I personally just don't really
like how these formula for a liquid some
mats already so for me I'm just I feel
like I'm a little bit more hyper
critical of whether they're streaky or
not whether they're too drying or not
etc this one doesn't feel too bad though
this one's not killing me like some of
her other ones huh for sure I'm a fan of
this one so far doesn't feel too bad
okay guys and that's it for Ty's entire
video of this review on the Kylie
cosmetics birthdate collection the
entire bundle is a hundred and seventy
five dollars so what do I think of this
entire bundle as 175 dollars um honestly
there was a lot of hits for sure but
there were definitely some misses I'm
not a huge fan of getting things like it
that are in a bundle if I know I'm not
gonna like multiple things so for me
personally I wouldn't buy it as a bundle
I would definitely just pick and choose
some pieces these I thought were nice
for example I thought the little bit
liquid lipsticks were really nice I
thought that keying highlighter was nice
I thought the palette was actually
really nice collectively was the entire
Kylie cosmetics collection was it a hit
or was it a miss I think it was
definitely more of a hit for sure I
think the packaging is Q I think it's
very girly it's very pretty it's very
like party esque
I think it's a little bit childish just
a little bit childish when I bought the
bundle as a whole know what I bought
individual items yes so yeah you guys
just take my review with a grain of salt
if you guys enjoy Cudi cosmetics
products get the bundle get do whatever
the fuck you want to do I just wanted to
review this because this is my personal
opinion on the items and no matter what
I'm going to say honest and give you my
personal opinions always just let you
guys know what I think personally as
always how great was the night or day
wherever you guys are and I will catch
you guys in my next video
