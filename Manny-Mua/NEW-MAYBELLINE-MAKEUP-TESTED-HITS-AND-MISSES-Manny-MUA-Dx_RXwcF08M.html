today's video is going to be a testing
of some new products video I recently
got this huge package in from Maybelline
and Maybelline just came out with a ton
of new Maybelline products and know this
video is not sponsored or anything I
know I have worked with abling in the
past I will always disclose whether or
not I'm sponsored in the video and this
one is not sponsored I literally just
have a huge amount of Maybelline makeup
and a lot of you guys were asking me on
Twitter to review it knew what
Maybelline makeup that just came out and
I got a package and I snapped it and you
guys were like yo review then you
Maybelline makeup so that is what
today's video is going to be as you can
see my hair is a little different cut it
a little differently this time you know
it sparked it a little bit differently I
feel very like very like Danny Zuko or
something I don't know greaser
ish I don't hate it I'm just not used to
I don't love anything you know I'm
saying yeah you guys that'll taste vo is
going to be that's why I already have my
base completely done I'm what are you
testing on the bronzer the highlighter
some of the palettes and you powder that
they have as always if you guys don't
this video if you guys do not like me
please don't watch it you know
the drill with that but you guys do like
this video please subscribe to my
channel if you're not already and if
you're new what's up I'm a name you and
welcome to my channel thank you so much
for being here but yeah let's go ahead
and get into this testing of a new a
Maybelline products come on drugstore so
first things first guys we have this new
little Maybelline master bronze face
studio highlight kit I really want to
use these guys right here to bronze and
contour this one has a little bit of
like gold glitter in it I don't you guys
can tell in the camera but there's if
you like show it differently there's a
little bit of gold specks on the powder
hmm I'm like praying that doesn't
translate on skin because I really don't
want that to happen so I'm gonna put it
on a more feed too and I'm going just
bronze with the skin and see how this
reacts on the skin okay I'm so stoked
because the glitter does not translate
on the skin whatsoever thank God cuz I
really didn't want that happened well
the bronzer itself is actually really
really really pretty oh my gosh like
it's not super pigmented you definitely
need to layer
okay so far that is a win let's see how
much it is let's see how much this
little bitch costs so this bad boy
retails for about $12.99 and you get
four shades in here we have the two
bronzers and kind of like two
highlighters I'm gonna swatch this other
shade right here right there we have
this color we have this color
they don't swatch very nice to be honest
that one that one was rough this one I
don't watch a lot nicer than the other
ones let's do a little bit of contouring
and see how that ax because that's going
to tell me whether or not I want to give
this a go or no so taking this on a
morphe why nine best contouring brush
ever it just so like mmm perfect I'm
gonna go into a contouring with this bed
by him what's a cooler tone color disc
it is more so for people with a medium
complexions I think that if you were to
light this would be a little bit too
like intense and kind of orange e on you
so I feel that people with medium skin
tones would benefit the most from this I
think that I swatch is pretty bad but on
the face it definitely definitely works
there's no denying that it's working and
it looks really nice for $12.99 I'm not
mad I'm not mad at all so far
this is the hit I'm liking that what's
next let's go ahead and go with the new
highlighter they just come out with and
I have been seeing this all over the
beauty world it's been taking it by
storm we have the master chrome so I'm
gonna go in with a morphe M 510 brush
amazing just highlighting brush and I'm
gonna take this bad boy let's watch what
our fingers first
oh my god it's it was literally so
 creamy it just went on like
oh my god I'm like shocked I did not
expect that much pigment to come off
holy
and go in
oh my god you guys that's what one layer
one weight I'm actually really
shook about this right now it's a little
bit on the nose okay so now I'm gonna
look up the price on this bad bitch on
the ameba Lina Master chrome a metallic
highlighter this is $9.99 aka $10 and I
would 100% without a doubt highly
recommend purchasing this this is
absolutely amazing I think my she looks
really nice it's very very glowy it's a
very metallics and bright and like
shockingly Wow
like if I were you I would get there cuz
holy holy Maybelline really
did that go you guys cuz god damn that's
 about I had no idea by probably
they came out with new fit me blushes as
well I do not have any of those blushes
they were not in the package I had no I
didn't even came out so I'm just gonna
apply some blush really quickly so I can
have a full face of makeup on there's a
spot my face I will not take pigment at
all so I tried to do this and like force
the pigment to be in this area people
are always like mani look so
patchy and I'm like actually I don't I
just can't tell you big mood there okay
next product I want to try out is this
new fit me loose finishing powder I
believe is like a setting powder their
fit me stuff is absolutely amazing so
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna use the
shade ten to cook underneath my contour
and see how that ax cuz it is a loose
finishing powder I should be able to
cook with it right I should be able to
bake with that okay I'm gonna take
some of the powder I'm gonna use it to
clean up Oh a few moments lay down okay
let's dust it off let's just so stuff
and try again oh yeah that work oh honey
okay guys we are basically don't the
face up this is all I have for the face
products that Maybelline came out with
so we're gonna move on to the eyes I
have a new eyeliner they came out with
and you brow product I came out with and
some eye palettes that came out with so
let's go and work on the brows really
quickly I have this new brow drama deep
brown a Maybelline shaping chalk powder
no clue a lot of dancing a little shaker
in here
y'all hear that how do you use it big a
little paddle fill with the flat side
waste tip to define a tail I'm doing
y'all in to see what we got
so we are going to so this was real
hardcore real quick guys um not twist
the edge to make it more defined okay so
this is definitely more of an on-the-go
product because goddamn I'm gonna take a
little brow spoolie and pray you can
like really spoolie this bitch out okay
you can't it's too much it's too much
product okay definitely not my favorite
product no my favorite what so ever
I mean we're cleaning it it doesn't look
still doesn't look good at all
the brow product flaw for me don't
really like it I think it puts down way
too much product it's really hard to
blend out and it looks
does it look some mess it looks
a minute okay I'm gonna fix my
brows off of camera and I'll be right
back okay guys so I try to save them as
much as I possibly could you guys the
real gag is that I still have to
go to an event tonight
so this makeup that I'm doing like I
don't really have time to change it like
it just kind of has to work out um but
so now that we're done with the brows
I'm gonna go ahead move on to the eyes
now and we have about five pallets here
so here we have graffiti pop we have a
concrete runway we have urban jungle we
have rooftop bronzes which is probably
the one I'm gonna use and we have
downtown sunrise oh that one's actually
really pretty as well I think
downtown contracts is like kind of
calling my name
it's not red code that really was
calling to me I'm like stop I'm
little focus what I think is weird about
these little pellets is that okay comes
with six shades right I think you can
only create about one or two looks with
this tops I don't think that they're
super practical the only one I think is
actually practical that people could use
a lot is this guy right here this is the
bronze one but let's swatch them see how
they feel oh my god they feel so
a creamy way so we're gonna take this
guy right here this little shade just
like a transition you show you
put that into the crease with this
morphing 27 it feels super smooth super
nice it literally feels amazing on the I
guys I'm really shook and I think I want
to take this like raspberry gold shade
picks up clearly wonderfully on a brush
hold it it's only cheese we're gonna
we're just gonna put that all over the
lid on the eye it's not asked pigmented
as I would like it to be great a little
bit of fix+ on it and let's see how oh
that's so much better just intensify it
a little bit yeah oh for sure
so that shade definitely takes a lot of
building but I think that once we you
get it there it's really really really
pretty
blend out those edges now we're gonna
take this really really pretty pinky
lilac e shade right here we're gonna put
that on the inner corner to really
brighten it up and it worked oh
my god I let's put that into there too I
kind of like how the whole look it looks
really monochromatic peach so I'm gonna
keep it that way I'm not gonna add too
much dimension in my crease obviously
continue to blend and keep the peachy
tones there because I think they look
really really pretty so these little
city mini palettes are about $9.99
that's about what 125 a shadow um this
is a tough call for me because I feel
like ten dollars for six shades is what
do you think of it like that way it's
like wow that actually really really
good but it doesn't seem there's a lot
of product in here and the only pallets
that are actually somewhat practical you
can use on a day-to-day basis are these
two only so these two I would say are
more approved that other ones not so
much quality of the shadows in here
we're actually really really nice I'm
very much blown away
I did not expect them to be as nice and
creamy and as smooth as the end of
turning out to be I was like whoa well
but you did definitely need to build up
for example this like raspberry shade
that I have on my lid and into my crease
you got to build that up intensely to
get the color payoff that you wanted
other than that I'm really pleasantly
surprised I'm really really pleasantly
surprised with these guys so you just
came out with a new master precise Inc
metallic liners and I pulled out the
gold cuz I think gold with this like
peach eye would be really fun so we're
gonna so I can see how it acts
where to go what we're gonna do instead
lean on top of the eyelids and ruining
the makeup that we have we're gonna put
a little bit of that on the lower lash
line because it's almost like a watery
consistency with a little bit of gold
flecks in it so to put that down here
ah oh uh I took on my concealer it's
true
oh my god it just removed all my
concealer no nope
urban decay I mean that cowboy heavy
metal glitter
I'm so annoyed that took all my
can see like that Wow
no no god no so these bad boys retail at
$8.99 and so I'm gonna say for me
personally that was a thousand oh-ho-ho
that was a no glitter and literally took
off my concealer bro that's a that's a
no okay so we are done with the eye
makeup now it's just a really cute just
monochromatic peachy look I think it
looks really really really pretty
so now we're gonna go and finish off
with the ellipse and we'll be completely
done using the new Maybelline Up
products we have super stay matte pink
and we also have the vivid hot lacquer
so I'm gonna just combine these two bad
bitches and we'll be done so we're gonna
keep it in the peachy Pham and I grabbed
it this color right here loyalist in the
shade 0-5 let's swatch on your hand
or here looks very pigmented very
promising okay let's go ahead put it on
our lips it smells up very very pleasant
okay goes on really thin but it feels
really thick yeah I'm not too sure about
this product guys it's pretty sticky I
really enjoy that very much I just feels
like feels very very heavy and goopy and
you know I'm saying we're gonna apply
the Velvets lip lacquer right on top of
it to give it a glossy feel this feels
amazing oh my god okay guys so now for a
price a breakdown on these bad bitches
right here we have the super state matte
ink for about ten dollars and the
lacquer for about eight dollars I think
the hot liquor is absolutely amazing if
you'll so creamy going on it's super
super pigmented look like wow smells
really nice too it goes on super super
nice I was like kind of blown away with
how beautiful I thought that one was and
that is 100% man anyway approved
however the matte
and not that biggest fan I think they're
a little bit too sticky and I think they
would take a little bit too long to dry
and they're so sticky in between the dry
point that it's like intense like I
really just don't want to have it on my
lips it feels really really heavy and
it's really just not what I want on my
lips the matte ink not my favorite I
would definitely not purchase that
myself but the hot lacquers I would a
hundred percent purchase this and that's
it you guys that's it for today's entire
video I hope you guys had fun watching
there's a lot of products where I was
like holy this is like a complete
complete win for me
I loved it I loved the chrome
highlighter the lip lacquer oh my god
those are absolutely amazing but there
were definitely some misses for me like
the matte ink and the brow powder not my
favorite things ever but again I say
this all the time that no brand is gonna
have something that I will love 100% of
the time that literally never freakin
happens finding that for the price point
drugstore products Maybelline is really
really really kicking ass but yeah other
than that I'm goose a night or day where
you guys are and I'll catch you guys in
my next video bye you guys
we are learning oh wait is this scented
coconut maybe he's born with it or maybe
his face
she got rope what is this man hey I
love it but can you love him no so now
if I were Brett oh my god it's still
sticky even do the lacquer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
