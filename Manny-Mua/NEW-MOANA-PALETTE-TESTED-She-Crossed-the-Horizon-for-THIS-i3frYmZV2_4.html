says you're gonna help me find the
 heart defeat a bitch the movies
about the adventures of what they're
dealing when they had to deal with this
 shiny ass crab if the deal these
little coconut people it is what it is
it's really really intense and it's a
great story and I would definitely
suggest it I might have messed up here
and there on the explanation but that's
what it is anyway so now let's get into
the palette what the palette actually is
so we have the heart it's a few - you
haven't opened it yet let's see the back
of it I know you guys are excited but
hold on give me a second use the
eyeshadow brush to apply eyeshadow
between the lashline and the crease of
eyelid gradually apply shadow in to
satirize with color
ingredients might get top mineral oil
mineral oil it's not the best thing
though designed in USA made in China and
it's copyrighted Disney and it's
distributed by Hot Topic so 15 grams of
product in your total so you're telling
me my wanna cross the horizon for this
let's say you're down you know
like moron across the horizon for this
I'm not trying to be an asshole I have
high expectations it is what it is or
maybe this could be a children's palette
I mean it's sold a hot topic maybe it's
literally meant for like five year olds
who knows we have oh my god she's really
really cute though because I'd like to
hold a vibe this is the heart of
defeating reindeer and I love mr. fede
and as a mirror which is cool we have a
Maui and his little tattoos up here and
we have the names we have the name two
things we have some of these things I
don't really it can't really pronounce
we have hard dirty video of course I can
do that one
we have Tiki Maui who uh MOTU Nui
Oh what do you love it stingray hey hey
what is the chicken amora
Tama Toa mini Maui at hua Asami artworks
ami I don't know monitory fishhook and
to come okay let's go ahead and swatch a
couple shades I'm just very intrigued
what colors here are we thinking we need
a swatch I feel like we need to do this
gold
okay feels feels soft chills nice pants
to the purple okay what is this big s
when why is it so big
I'm losing hope MOTU Nui we got here
well I'm not gonna lie this is looking
real dim you know when they in the movie
when they went to visit like the spirit
realm you know with the big-ass beasts
you know how I got a little shady down
there
that's how I feel like no okay you know
what we're gonna do the Pink's the
Pink's you can never go on with a soft
pink you okay we're gonna go in with
Tiki this guy right here
hey hey hey - so these are pressed so
hard I can't actually get anything off
on the brush let's see you'll see
anything other than chalk get some
purple there we go
what picnic sweetie where's the pigment
at honey I'd like to know are y'all
seeing what I am seeing where did it all
go on the lid you know it was there it
was there but it's all gone now okay I'm
losing faith quickly quickly losing
faith how maybe he did a little bit motu
nui on the lid out here
Oh sweetie this is trash I can't use
anymore like I physically and am unable
to keep using this it's so so I'm
gonna stop now while we're behind let me
just say that cannot believe they did
more on this dirty she saved all their
asses dude she put the little
harder - fede back into the feeding
which was appalling lava monster they do
are like this okay I'm getting emotional
look at this my eyes are tearing up I
can't tell if it's the shitty-ass
eyeshadows or my emotion I don't know
but anyway you guys I'm gonna go and say
that this was a complete flop I don't
know what else to say
Maui did her dirty and this still dinner
even more dirty remember
whatever I might turn into a stingray
I cried I'm getting a crack okay anyways
y'all if you guys see this a hot topic I
would suggest not purchasing it because
it is quite possibly one of the worst
pallets I've ever tried in my entire
life and I've tried a lot of pallets
other than children's makeup this is the
worst I've ever tried but I can't decide
if this is a child
makeup palette cuz it's 15
oh it's cruelty-free and vegan on that
swing but when the products trash no one
wants that no one cares honey I'm not
gonna be talking about it because I
think you guys can see for yourselves
what's going on in my eye right now
currently you do what you want to do
with your coin if you want to buy this
you buy this and if you love Morna good
because I do do but I would definitely
suggest not purchasing it because that
was a complete flop for me and yeah you
guys that is it for today's video
because had fun not watching I had so
much fun doing this video and no idea
that was gonna be this bad mm-hmm and no
idea especially like people that live
from a wanna like me like I'm a moron a
lover and for them to make me spend $15
on something that was an act like it
hurts me hurts me I love you all so
 much I will not be linking this
down below I will have a great rest of
the night or day wherever you guys are I
love you guys so much and I'll catch you
guys in my next video obvious that from
watching this review on the Moana pallet
