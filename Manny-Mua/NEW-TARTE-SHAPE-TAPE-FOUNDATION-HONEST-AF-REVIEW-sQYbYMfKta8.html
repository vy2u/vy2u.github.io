so today's video I have been asked okay
I've learned I don't think I've ever
been asked more to do ever if you want
something in my entire existence in my
entire visa total las vidas
on youtube mmm that's not right I don't
know I just had hard to be really honest
all the lives of YouTube I don't
know anyway guys I am going to be
reviewing today the new Tarte double
duty Beauty shaped ape foundation this
is what it looks like this is the PR
package it came in I already soaked the
Beauty Blender that's why it's out of
here we have two formulas we have the
hydrating and we have the matched this
is obviously not all the shades this is
the PR package that he sent me but
before I get started on today's video I
wanted to bring up a thing real quick
let's talk about the elephant of the
room with this this has been under so
much controversy and so much hype
because of the fact that the shade range
is so little I believe is only 15 shades
and the majority of them are lighter
complexion shades and there's not enough
for deeper complexion shades and I
completely agree with you guys 1,000% I
think you are definitely should have
launched more deeper complexion shades I
think only 15 shades is definitely
definitely not enough when you're a
brand like Tarte people just expect a
lot from you it just it is what it is
Hart honestly you guys should have known
better and hopefully you actually coming
out with more shades in the future and
they're coming quickly because I do
think that it's unfair for I can't
imagine being someone with a darker
complexion seeing and really wanting to
try this foundation out and not having a
shade for me because of the fact that
they didn't come out with enough shades
and they only cater to Landor
complexions I just think it's unfair and
yes it's not a struggle I might face and
I don't I don't face that kind of
struggle I don't really know how it
feels to have a darker complexion and to
not be able to use a foundation shade
because they don't have my shade and I
don't get that struggle but I do a nice
the fact that I am privileged in the
fact that I do get a have my find a
shade in the Sun you should and I wanted
to use that privilege to at least talk
about the fact that I think that there
should have been more shades it's not
fair do you recognize the fact that I am
lighter complexion and it is easier for
me to find my shade and it sucks that
that's like that in the beauty industry
and I feel like more brands needing to
cater to a variety of shades into a
variety of genders and just I'm all for
equality you know at the end of the day
I'm for equality that's not going to
change my opinion on what I think about
the actual foundation at the end of the
day this is a foundation review on that
core quality of this foundation I just
wanted to say that and have my
with the fact that I'm like yo I think
that needs to be more shades is is
ridiculous that there's not enough but I
do half my face with the glowy one and
half the face with the matte one I think
that'd be like the most fair shot I can
do with this one nation I'm gonna wear
it for next couple of hours and see what
we think about the foundation so anyways
you guys have to take video is going to
be as always if you guys don't like this
video if you guys do not like me please
don't watch it you know the
drill with that what do you guys do like
the video please go ahead subscribe to
my channel if you're not already and if
you know what's up I'm an emu a and
welcome to my channel thank you so much
for being here I really appreciate it
yeah that's gonna get into this heart
shape tape foundation review and demo
and let's see if it's worth the hype
enough okay so what do we have here we
have a hydrating foundation and we have
a mattifying foundation I'm so sorry
about this let's go ahead and go on the
Tarte website let's go and read the
facts about these foundations
specifically okay guys so let's go ahead
and read about the mat one first which
is one I'm a little bit more interesting
because I have oily or skin it is a
vegan oil free full coverage foundation
with a creamy texture and modern matte
finish it provides a the same full
coverage as its concealer predecessor it
dries to a flawless matte finish
concealer inspired wan formula absorbs
oil and shine I'm gonna try the shade
light/medium neutral and see what we
think
oh let's prime my skin I want to give
this bitch a fair shot this is exactly
gonna I'm gonna do the same routine that
I usually do on my face I'm taking the
Tarte little beauty sponge that I came
with we're gonna use it this is actually
kind of a harder sponge but it's soft it
seems time this reminds me a lot of my
cult classic cake and baked sponge from
Vera Mona that's what it feels like it's
like hard but it's like very dense but
it's soft at the same time I'm gonna
Bobbi Brown taking Bobbi or take a
smidgen of professional I benefit with
on the t-zone cool we are primed and we
are ready to go we're gonna go in we're
gonna go in with the matte foundation
first one takes is shaped like the
immature like we said earlier we got a
huge asset doe up here this reminds me a
lot this honestly could be like the same
as the Clinique the beyond perfect
foundation I think it's called has like
that huge ass toe applicator looks like
this it's very very similar that should
match we're gonna do a good couple dots
bitch okay okay as we're applying it
it's pretty thick this is the
lightest shade they gave me and it's
still a little dark for me so we're just
gonna kind of go
literally that's one that's one that's
one no foot that's just one okay so as
we see a little yellow okay we're gonna
blend this in with the sponge that they
came wait let me see the coverage it's
full it just is the coverage is
there was a drying pretty quick
oh it is too dark for me way too
dark for me okay it's fine okay so it
sets in pretty quickly you guys so you
definitely want to use I mean usually
with matte foundations they set pretty
fast so this is half the face with the
matte foundation that's going to get
closer
I don't you think the one with a bit
more to be really real I think that
using it with a sponge of course is
going to sheer it out a little bit let's
go ahead and take a little bit more also
I noticed that it seems to oxidize it's
getting a little bit darker like as you
see application wise it's a little bit
of a lighter consistency or it's a
little bit lighter of a color but when
I'm blended out and it's drying it
definitely dries down to a darker
finished it's a little bit deeper for
sure I'm just noticing the oxidation but
honestly look how pretty it looks on the
skin I would definitely apply this with
a sponge instead of a brush I think a
brush would make it look like we ignore
the fact that it's not my shade
sometimes I won't get the right shade
it's fine happens
consistency was really nice it was very
more so on the thick whipped side it's
not too liquidy of course it's much more
than a thicker consistency I'd ride down
math really really fast like the set was
quick so let's go and go in with the
light medium honey in the hydrating one
that's going to read about the hydrating
shade though by the way you guys both of
these are $39 okay this is a
hypoallergenic luminous finish gel
foundation featuring the same iconic
buildable full coverage same as shape
tape concealer padded boots of skin
smoothing oil-free hydration same full
coverage I supposed to be a weightless
gel formulation anna has a hyaluronic
acid in it which means of course
hyaluronic acid adds moisture to the
skin throughout the day so I'm imagining
it okay its oxidizing this bitch is
oxidizing hard if you guys soaked are
did not send me the same shade or the
hydrating foundation I don't know if
they have the same shade oh bitch I'm
sorry for worried about it look like
right now if we're going to use light
medium stand so these are the shades
these are the two closest to each other
so I'm not to use those these undertones
are a little bit in
I'm not you have to go online and buy my
crutch shape because these are not what
I expected shade wise look Oh dark disk
on the oxides like a mofo anyway that
annoys me like that really gets on my
nerves
oxidation anyway we're gonna go and try
it be luminous side now I want to take
this and I can definitely tell already
that's a consistency on this side is
definitely very different it's not as
thick it's definitely more like a like
they were saying a gel-like consistency
so I guess technically it's a little bit
thinner in consistency H these
undertones I don't really know all that
I don't know all this okay we're going
to blend it in with the same sponge
we're gonna see what we think of the
coverage and the feeling of this one as
I'm blending in this one definitely
feels more lightweight of course wasn't
feels nicer to me actually think this
side might be a little bit too matte for
me like now that I'm looking at it once
it's actually set bitch that is like so
mad like I don't even need to use powder
to set this side like that's how intense
it is this side I would definitely say
as we're looking at it still gives you a
nice medium to full coverage I wouldn't
say this is as full coverage as the
matte side to me it really doesn't look
like that it definitely gives me more of
a skin like I can still see like my
little pimple going on right here I can
still see some red spots around here but
upon another layer just like I did with
the other side I can clearly see a
difference in color obviously so we're
gonna do a little bit more but you guys
see how it like blends into a different
color than it applies I don't really get
that I would say this one you can
definitely apply it with like a like
kabuki style brush one like this and it
will not look as heavy as the matte side
would have with that kind of brush see
how well it does uncovering of my
discoloration on my neck because I have
discoloration down here I think that's
to do with my vitiligo I don't really
know but knowing this applies really
makes me what this kind of brush to okay
as we can see this side mattes this
side definitely has skin like texture
it's very hydrating looking and it
definitely gives me a sheen to the skin
I'll actually have to set this side to
last on me for sure so at least you can
see there is a very harsh real
difference between both sides of the
skin this is definitely definitely
luminous
glowy more with skin like finish this is
mattes I actually really do enjoy
the luminous side a lot more I'm gonna
go and set both sides of the face just
so I can set them and see what we
actually think
we take a little bit of the protective
concealer already in the tart shaped
tape world right now let's take the
shade light and see how it acts with the
Fang I feel like Donald Trump on this
side honestly it looks too orange and
the light under-eye pitch really ug
light works for me but because of the
fund you should shade is so dark on my
skin right now it's really contrasting
quite intensely okay actually at least
with the concealer I feel like my face
doesn't look so like up because
of how much of a contrast the shade is
like it's just it's rough I'm not living
as hard as I thought I was in me I
really thought I was gonna live like a
different heart-shaped ape like I really
dead we're gonna be a hard living like
living breathing gasping for air but so
far the side with the luminous finish I
like so much more okay guys we're gonna
go ahead and set the face see what we
think and we're going to let we're gonna
wear this for a couple hours I'm gonna
do my makeup for real I'm gonna set my
face I'm gonna give it a real fair shot
like I'd do any other foundation I'm
gonna put powder on both sides so you
only think and we're gonna come back
with the final verdict seeing whether or
not the foundation is a hit or miss
we're gonna do some powder on this we're
gonna put we're gonna powder both sides
I always powder my foundation so I'm
gonna powder even the side and that is
matte no powder right to give it a fair
shot okay let's go and look at it now
that we are set in place I feel like the
matte side is a little bit too heavy
looking it feels actually kind of heavy
on the skin this side I really enjoy
this side a little too heavy and I don't
know if it's me being distracted as
by the color cuz I'm obviously very
distracted by the fact that the color
difference is whoa I'm gonna go ahead
and do the rest of my makeup now and
wait in a couple hours and see what we
think of both sides which side got a bit
more oily and we will get back to you so
it's been about I finished everything
else and I eat so it's been about an
hour and a half maybe two hours since I
first put on the foundation so I already
have a little bit of a verdict here so
this is the side of course this is the
matte side I sprayed it with Urban Decay
all nighter by the way when I finished
everything when I finished everything I
sprayed with Urban Decay all nighter
just to melt our being together the
foundation is still looking very pretty
honestly like I think this side
this iron this side is the side with the
luminous
more lightweight coverage the matte side
with everything said and done I actually
do like it a lot I was at first I was
kind of like I really wasn't like living
for the mattes I don't know why I was
living more for the luminous side I just
feel like goes more buildable of
coverage was a little bit lighter in
coverage and it just looked prettier on
my skin to me also on my eyes if a guys
are curious about the shadows I use I'm
using the morphe 25g palette
there's morning if I have a grande glam
huge ass pans on this bitch you
guys wanna check it out it's really
really cool I love the color scheme of
it you can use code mani MUA
in store online if you want to check it
out you'd save some coin you don't have
to of course if you don't want to it's
all good I just want to let you guys
know that has what I'm wearing on my
eyes as well as some Urban Decay heavy
metal liner okay so anyway I'm gonna go
and wait a couple more hours and see how
the foundation is settling into the skin
right now I feel like it's at a perfect
point two hours in I feel like it looks
really really really pretty and I'm
really happy with it I think it looks
nice I don't really have too many
complaints other than another color and
undertone it's not my favorite thing I
don't really really like the undertone
and color of them but anyway I can
definitely tell this side is still more
luminous than this side this side is
staying a lot more matte this site is
definitely more skin like ignore the
highlighter as its settling into the
skin I think it's looking a lot more
pretty so this is the skin as close as I
can really go so we have the pores on
the skin it's not they're not too
emphasized which I really really like
this is the matte side there's no like
major creasing on my smile lines which
is a big deal to me not too oily so we
have this sign and we can see the pores
definitely still are there there's
definitely pores areas then the matte
type zone the matte side is better at
concealing the pores then the site is
but I just still feel like my skin looks
prettier on the side regardless of like
the poor showing or not I'm not mad at
it right now like I'm not mad at it but
we'll see how I feel in the next couple
hours so I will be back what is up you
guys okay guys so I've had my makeup on
for about six hours and now it is on I
think I basically just have the verdict
I think I know how I think about the
foundation now I don't need to have it
on for any longer for me to know how I
feel about it so right now this is after
about 6 hours of where it's about 6
o'clock and I handed and I started
putting makeup on at 12:00 so still
looks pretty mad I see some oil
speaking through here oils peeking
through around my chin a little bit more
here right here as well as definitely
well speaking through in the t-zone the
Dewey one is looking real duty at this
point you know the the hydrating one is
looking real hydrated the skin is
looking hydrated besides looking more
matte it is what it is it's the claim is
correct miss mama so you guys I forgot
to mention earlier that part of the new
shape tape range we also have this
sponge I did of course usually it came
with like PR package and this brushes
well they're both part of the shape tape
collection both of them I believe retail
for $28 in case you guys are interested
in that I really liked it the sponge
wasn't the biggest fan of this brush I'm
not a huge fan of these brushes anyway
to be honest unless it's for powder I
think powder application with this is
really good applying this fine
foundation whether it's the Mac or it's
the hydrating one is better off with a
sponge but all know what do I think
about it so the matte side this is the
mad scientist really pretty and honestly
I would buy both of them they are both
approved for me I really do like them on
the face right now I still feel like
they look really beautiful on the skin
to be honest though first impressions
you guys saw earlier I wasn't living you
know I feel like for the color selection
the color selection was bad not only was
the color selection bad but the
undertones were just not good and these
are obviously not my color I cannot wear
these again I don't have to go and get
my correct color and it is frustrating
that the undertones are so strong in
these foundations because it's just kind
of like can I just have one like that's
more in the most neutral like a neutral
one not the one that's too peach not one
that's too yellow as we all know the
arrangement of colors in general is not
the best when it comes to light and deep
complexions there's not enough for deep
complexions but this our nation is a $39
I think that's a really fair price point
it's not too too too expensive but it's
not very cheap either and you get one
point zero one fluid ounce in here which
is pretty average for a foundation and I
think the cost of this being $39 is
actually pretty fair overall this time I
think the matte one actually played
better on my skin what's your shopping
because that's what I didn't like at all
first going on the hydrating one looks
beautiful too and I really really really
enjoy it I just wish I had a little bit
more coverage because I had to build
that one up a lot more and the thing is
too with the matte one for me the reason
that it I feel like it worked out in the
end is because I do have natural oils
that will seep through because I'm more
on the oily side so if you're not really
at all and even yeah if you're dry then
I really think that you're gonna
hate the dry the matte one because I
think that the reason that
even looks pretty now or that's actually
some Mex mixing in with the skin nicely
is due to the fact that my oils are
sleeping through like honestly just go
with the hydrating one it is
hydrating it's beautiful on the skin
yeah that's my thoughts those are my
opinions I think welcome end up turning
out really pretty both of them are a hit
for me so I hope you guys enjoyed
today's video
all-in-all I use them again if I get my
right color down I might use the
hydrating one again but I don't know
it's still not my favorite foundation
ever I still like the concealer more
than the foundations and that is it you
guys hope you guys enjoyed today's video
I'll leave a link down below where you
guys to check these foundations out I
believe they are available on tarts
website my shelter available Ulta just
yet hope you guys had fun watching have
a gist of the night or day group you
guys are and I'll catch you guys in my
next video bye guys I love you

wanted to do on a Tuesday matter

Dada Dada
oh my god my dad I know it's a little
bird oh my god
what happened to it why is being held so
calmly don't let me go I'm sneezing a
fly or something he's so cute sponge
