today's video is going to be a review
and first impressions demo on the
brand-new two-faced little love light
prismatic highlighter I have not yet
tried them and I really really wanted to
do a first impressions video to see if
they're worth of the price or not and I
asked you guys on snapchat you guys
wanted me to do a review on them or not
and a lot of you guys requested me to do
it so I'm like okay fine I'm going as
soon as I get back from out of town I'm
going to film with these bad boys
they're so absolutely beautiful edges
and see I'm like the packaging is
adorable so you guys want to see a
review and demo and is it worth it on
these highlighters I have no idea yet if
I'm gonna peel these or not keep on
watching as always if you guys want this
feel if you guys don't like me please
don't lie to me with that but
you guys like this video and like videos
like this give this video a thumbs up
and subscribe to my channel if you want
already so again to review and demo of
the new Too Faced Lovelight heart
highlighters sure let's talk Twitter hey
guys so these are from the brand to face
as you guys know I'm sure you guys are
not living on a rock you guys know this
is so classic to face packaging these
retail for $30 each and they came up
with three shades first we have blinded
by the light which is the lightest shade
we have ray of light which is the
pinkier shade and we have you light up
my life which is the golden highlight
shade they each contain 9 grams of
product which I believe that's a lot
like 9 grams sounds like a bunch thank
grams that's a lot that's a lot of
so the Sephora app tells me that it's a
heart-shaped highlighter with a silky
smooth texture that allows for a
buildable pearl radiance and it's a
liquid to powder formula and it's Bane
it features a luminosity boosting agent
that instantly brightens it delivers
gorgeous color payoff with a pearl
radiant finish cool so I'm going to
honestly just swatch them on my hand
first I'm gonna swatch them here and
just see what we think of the colors
first in the swatch and I'm gonna decide
which colors which two colors I'm gonna
put on each cheek to see how they act on
the tree can we just talk about the
inside and how freakin sick nasty that
press is look how cool this is with this
diamond heart filter Dennis I don't know
I'm just literally living and breathing
for it I think it's so gorgeous
again this highlighter is $30 so it's
got to be worth a
honey okay so we're going to go in first
with the shade blinded by the light
which is this color right here of course
we're going to swatch it on our finger
we're going to cute one too okay we got
some shine we got some shine a little
harder
can I press it a little harder the more
that came off and now we're going to put
this we're going to swatch it on our
hand and see what we think we have
gorgeous I was a little skeptical on the
finger but on the hand it looks
absolutely beautiful so far I'm digging
blinded by the light this is a lighter
shade I'm probably in for this one on
one of my cheeks cool so now we're gonna
go in with the rose see that little seen
that color this is in the shade ray of
light which is the pinky one it's just
ah look at this this is so beautiful
honestly it makes me go on the light you
know what I mean like it's so pretty
we're going to give it a 1 to give it a
fair swatch go to fair swatch okay
that's right here so this is a peachy
pink color of course as you guys can see
it's a very peachy pink not as blinding
as the white one so it's going to swatch
on the hand see what we think of it
right here next to ray of light you can
see right here very pretty this one is
not as blinding as you can see as the
first one is but of course the first one
is a lot lighter maybe that's why it's a
little bit more intense feeling this
shade it feels smooth like the first one
but it actually feels a little bit more
powdery then the other one does like a
little bit more powder kicks up on this
one not a bad thing I'm just saying that
is what I feel thankfully not not too
bad not too bad as you can see not too
bad now we're going with last watches
that you light up my life you light up
my life in the gold in the cold
the goal is so beautiful to it literally
looks like brick of gold I live I
 live and breathe are you get a
fair swatch again it was very very
smoothly just like the first one did ooh
intense like the first one was as well I
like this I like that okay great so I
feel like that one was a beautiful
beautiful swatch so we have the gold one
we have the peach one we have the white
one as you can see they look like this
right here
I feel like the white one and the golden
are the most reflective the pink is a
very subtle
you I suppose so because the bold one
looks really nice I'm gonna going with
the white Hammond going with the pink on
each cheek just to see how the white and
the pink will build on the face so far
I'm impressed with the white one and I'm
impressed with the gold one let's go in
highlight the right side of my face with
the white one blinded by the light bitch
better blind me or else cuz this
is not being called blinded by the light
for no reason you feel me I'm gonna go
in with a more free em 5 10 brushes my
classic go-to highlighting brush so
we're going to load it up layer two okay
layer three so blinded by light this
isn't right here with four layers on my
cheek it looks beautiful on camera I
think it looks really pretty on my face
as well it just took four layers to get
it to what I wanted it to be for opacity
opacity it got there so I think that we
can you can definitely build this
highlighter when I went in with the
first swatch I was like tear cut like it
just didn't look like it was gonna be a
blinding highlight which I wanted it to
because it's called blinded by the
 light but building up it
definitely got there anything it's
absolutely beautiful now we have to do
the other side with the shade ray of
light which is the pinkier one because
that was the less opaque one on my hand
and I want to test the most opaque and
then less okay and I'm gonna go in with
the brush - why 14 so we are going to
load that bad bitch up okay one layer is
not enough two layers still not enough
three layers four layers
hmm this one's not as intense this one's
not as blinding another one it's a
really pretty pinky peach okay well
swatch on the hand
swatch on the face we have the peachy
pink one on the side huh we are in a
conundrum guys I have my verdict I have
my red whether I think these are worth
of the $30 or not oh my got $30 for the
plug this is with four layers each on
the sides of my face four layers of this
color four layers of this color to get
it to the opacity
I wanted it to be the white one got
there the pink one did not so I will say
my verdict what do I think about these I
think that total they are a beautiful
highlighter I love the packaging
I think this diamond-encrusted press is
freakin phenomenal that the heart is
adorable I love the concept so much
however I think that the product inside
of it if you guys like a natural
highlight that you can build you're
gonna love this and I think that you
guys will love it and you guys will go
out and buy it I'll be obsessed but if
you guys are anything like me where you
guys want a powering highlight right
away and you want it to be blinding a
really intense that I don't think these
are gonna be your favorite because this
took me four times to build and they
still not even that lightning that's
four that's four layers of highlight and
it still is not blinding and that's the
lightest one so I think that's kind of
that's kind of annoying to me so in my
opinion personally do I think that they
are worth the $30 no I don't only
because I like more of a blinding
highlight I feel like these highlighters
were blinding and intense and really POW
I would be into it but these are much
more of a soft ray of light kind of
highlight and if you guys are into those
soft highlights awesome I think you guys
will really really love these because
they look really really pretty on the
skin they're very soft
and they're like a glisten I like it for
layers later I like it but I don't think
that they're my thing personally like
personally but personally they're not
really my thing
and yeah guys that's it for the entire
video happy I said fun watching my
review and demo using the new Too Faced
highlighters the little heart
highlighters that are really really
adorable and cute let me know you guys
want to see more reviews on things
reviews and first impressions are really
really fun just to see well my first
question is right away to see if I like
the product or not I'm like is it good
it's like if I can like it am I not
gonna like it you know I'm my face can't
lie I'm just gonna be like hold me I
like it already don't that's just what
it is so how these that's a good thing
about me when you're watching me that my
face does not lie at all I like it or I
don't like it and these I liked but I
didn't love them and I wouldn't pay the
radar um I'd paint like $20 for them I
paid 20 yeah guys I love you guys so
much okay the night or day where you
guys are and I'll catch you guys in my
next video bye guys my 4 layers of it to
get into the opacity the opacity that I
really is they're really honestly
