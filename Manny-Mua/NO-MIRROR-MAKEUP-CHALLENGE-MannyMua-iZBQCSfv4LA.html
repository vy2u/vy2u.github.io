duo that's a highlighting one I'm taking
the yellow powder underneath my eyes and
I'm using I'm using the little black
thing to cover up the mirror because I
ain't trying to cheat that's like Larry

fantasy
my goal is to make my mom laugh right
now
I'm Sasha glow kit yes I've already used
this a couple times and I'm obsessed
with my mix bubbly and drippin and gold
I'm just me

do the more likely way and freaking us
you have the brighter you are the closer
hit to a sauce yeah so let me go ahead
and contour in just a little contouring
you guys okay I'm taking the middle on
oh my god I almost saw myself huh
I was cheated I didn't see anything
nothing on this is gonna be hard
I had a contour a very specific kind of
way I didn't get a lot though I got a
little bit kinda I'm a little scared of
the contouring when in doubt blend it
out my problems you can see my mother's
face see you judging me triggered by a
nose contour - you might as fucking well
but going in because you may notice I
can see it
just this is Jeannie with me Australis
work with me
I like underneath the cheek where can I
have contoured let me clean it up down
here on the jaw
I thought the face was gonna be easy
honestly this is so hard okay
face spritz of Smashbox primer water now
I'm gonna do the eyes this is what I was
scared to do okay so I'm gonna use what
I know which is like my travel like
palette they take all the time with me
to travel with so I'm just gonna go and
dip into this and just start
oh my kind of thing prime my eyes into
my brows some take the hottest sauce
your brow definer in dark brown and just
like and just go in honestly this is my
brow
oh my nice my brow this is the hard part
this is hard feel like I'm going way off
the brow I'm going a little hand let me
just spoil you through use that's bully
if you're scared like me as if I'm
playing musical instrument just go with
this look it's not funny
we're gonna do your makeup with no
mirror and see how you freaking like it
you were doing a lot longer than me oh
shit I know going ham I'm going ham on
the outer corner I know it's turning out
bad how about you - his brows like he
remember he did them in his video and I
was really impressed
bitch how did you feel for this though I
have no hairs at the end of my brow I'm
associate brow gel
where am i brows oh my gosh I have any
yeah doing the brow part feels like you
have no freaking brows I'm not even
kidding it's the weirdest thing

underneath my eyes so don't know where
the other is and she can use out of my
primary today oh oh this is gonna be
hard
mm-hmm

don't feel like I did anything okay just
grab a powder just set the bitch and
you're good go with the eyes now for
reals for reals okay each one seven more
feet
I know you let me go the back of my hand
do not feel me where's my crease where
are you I always go higher than my
crease though oh my god this is hard I
just got this in the mail recently -
they melt radioactive stack which is
like they're like neon colors maybe I'll
try to incorporate one of these
brightest colors in this look Mayo -
pink no nominate coins that's more me
I'm take an orange we're gonna go in
with more cane 433 and just go into that
crease I mean is easy I don't know
they're paying dinner or not I mean for
the are I need some F it's melt they're
gonna even do it like you can just feel
it I'm gonna be so disappointed in
myself if I don't do well I don't think
I'm going to do well but if I don't do
well I'm gonna think wow Manuel you done
fucked up how are you friends with
Patrick and Jacqueline I must be 27
again I'm just gonna blend with nothing
else and just hope cuz a bit nice a
button I think bitten by makeup geek
which is a color that I know well one of
my tried-and-true zhh I don't think it
will fail me probably well I don't think
well it's the finding the crease at the
hard part or are ya
put that bad boy in there
what the hell you give me rock you mean
come now that's Meyer we have that down
we're just gonna blend with it in four
three three that's blink just feel it
just feel like you feel them you think
it's like the key to this the key to the
no mirror makeup challenge is blending

do you just blend and you pray it's
going with the dark color gonna grab a
dark chocolate brown on a pencil brush
my bag I know I want to do a winged
liner I want to be real festive feel
like that the outer corner of the crease
is good I'm Gucci for the crease I'm
gonna take one of the new dose of colors
I'm ideal duos I'm gonna take the like
cream shadow take a cream shower and
then it's a base color which I'm so
excited about doing they did so awesome
with these I'm gonna take the shade
shell the base first so use my fingers
we're gonna gone with fingers we're just
gonna hope for the best it would be so
hilarious I did good because I really
truly feel like I'm doing so bad I
should probably have not done a first
impressions version of the no mirror
makeup challenge hmm take it off my lids
are sticky okay so let's take a peek
okay we're just gonna press it
on top where I feel sticky house look

about I got in it nothing like the no
mirror makeup challenge to make you
fucking humble about shrinking skills no
lie

that they'll alert house because he word
when I was in that later because I was
so scared
um Cody lashes Oh God really curl them
off like with that with the friggin your
little own without roller lash my
benefit nope

inner corner might as well and then for
the waterline I'm do a new liner
Oh God hmm giggle play black lash back
extended play giggle at I don't even I'm
not depending on mascara in general
especially on the bottom doing without a
mirror is quite obstacle okay I'm gonna
prod some watches I'm gonna take Bella
buy a new bounce um might ride in
motherfuckin true this is hard
oh fuck me
I find the lashes on pretty nice feels
comfortable how's it look
well shit everything on my right side I
feel is more natural because I'm a
right-handed so I feel like that's why I
put the lash on with vindication that's
not so hard with VIN diction no what's
the word that link relative with the V
that you like you're powerful
Vin Diesel clearly we're not the smart
one family
wow that feels uncomfortable lips we are
gonna do a deeper lip because I feel my
eyes are really natural so I do Mack
burgundy on the lips I don't know a job
without a mirror oh my god where am I I
don't have already defined lit either
which is why I could kind of pull off an
intense over drop because my lips are
not defined on the edges like it look
it's just like really like skin lip hey
there's no like riveting nothing oh shit
I went underneath a lip I went too far
and then we take the dose of colors mood
at little lipstick which is one of their
newest liquid lipsticks so excited try
these out I'm like been dying

mirror just give it to me not ready I'm
not ready which sides are not not
magnified I want to be not magnified not
magnified okay you guys I'm not ready

just rip it off I'm kind of in love just
to look at it though okay
the we had a mind of its own what the
heck the lashes went on like not
terribly the wing on the right though
that would have some fucking conviction
with it oh my god the wing on the left I
truly don't know what happened it it
looks like a stingray swim into the
motherfuckin ocean lips what do you
think I think you practiced off-camera
no I did not so this is what I make it
looks like real close to the lashes are
off because this will look but I look as
if like oh what is so long another one's
