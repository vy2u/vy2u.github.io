Beauty favorites that I've been loving

December December and like Christmas
time is my favorite time of the year it
is just an amazing time I love to give
back honestly okay let's just give it to
you how it really is this year has been
the best year of my entire life truly it
has been I've never been this
financially stable I've never been more
stable with myself as a person and it's
just been such a whirlwind this entire
year 12:15 really has been the best year
of my entire life and I owe it all to
you guys honestly you guys have been the
most amazing the most amazing followers
and following I could ever ask for truly
my maniax literally are my life in my
soul and it's like I'm grateful for the
three FS this year family friends and my
followers honestly honest to god you
guys have made my year perfect it's just
been as perfectly the possibly could
have it and this month is the month that
my palette launches with makeup geek I
know you guys have seen it and I know
you guys are freaking dying for it
because I've been getting hundreds and
thousands of comments and tweets and
everything about the palette and you
guys are so supportive cannot wait so
you guys get it into your hands I know
it's gonna be sick I promise you I will
never put a product I don't fully
believe in and this palette is my heart
and my soul but you have a Rambler I'm
rambling today so it's been a while
since I Hale I'm rambling as always if
you guys don't like this video if you
guys don't like me please don't
watching
you know the Joe with that but if you
guys do like this video and you guys do
let me please like this video and
subscribe to my channel if you aren't
already and if you're new hi but let's
go and get into this favorite mmm this
is always the hard part about the
favorites videos like what you want to
start off with you're like I don't know
what star Queen how do I saw what the
biggest items and go to the smallest
item okay let's do that
okay first item I want to talk about is
a holiday item from Tarte okay I've been
receiving so many holiday sets gift sets
holiday from other brands holiday
it's a holiday because honey obviously
like this is the time for brands to put
out a holiday pallets and some like that
this one specifically is one that since
speaking to me like into my ear into my
soul hey you how you doing I'm tart like
that's how much it's been speaking to me
so basically looks like the powder box
is gorgeous the packaging is stunning
like are you kidding me it's a little
drawer with a little lip thing and a
little mascara this one looks like you
got a humongous mirror and you get these
three little palettes what you do is you
pull up this little string and each
palette has eight shadows and a blush I
think this says 49 bucks but honestly
like this is probably one of the most
sickening deals that I've seen with the
holiday I'm gonna pull them all out
right now so this is what it looks like
when you put all of them together it is
24 shadows 3 blushes and I think they're
to die for I just think honestly this is
one of the best sets I've seen all
holiday it's amazing look at this get
the little lip stuff down here what like
what the so I really like that
honestly Tarte just kills me always what
they're packaging and with their holiday
stuff I just I miss a thousand of them
my second biggest thing some carry you
know like the morphe 9c contour palette
this is what it looks like I am so in
love with this palette you swatch like
are you Jay are you it's butter it's
butter honestly I just love this part
because I think the quality is
absolutely amazing but the price point
is so there I think it's like 20 to 25
bucks or something like that and you get
12 contouring and highlighting shades
this is so great for every single skin
tone you get your highlighting shades up
here you're more bronzy shades down here
and then you get your contouring shades
down here I just think that this is such
a great quality palette I think morphe
has really been kicking up their
lately I'm close with the owner Murphy
and she told me that they've been
switching up the labs
the new lab that they're going with is
so much higher quality than the last lab
that they had so every thing that
they're coming out with is even better
than the quality before hand so I don't
that make sense in my head and make
sense that's just like an insider thing
if I mean I don't you guys care or not
but the new labs quality is even higher
than what they were in the past so I
think the 9c palette is just absolutely
amazing I have a code with Murphy man
EMU way in all caps saved you 10% I'm
gonna fill you with them I always tell
you guys I just like to be honest with
you guys and let you know how I'm gonna
fill you with the brand or not and
morphe isn't one of my favorites and I
will always support them 100% I just use
this recently in my Affordable holiday
tutorial and you guys saw like it was
working pretty good alright alright next
let's go ahead and bring up a brush I
always have brushes it at least at least
I always have at least one brush in a
favorites video I just cannot stop with
brushes I love them I know you're proud
because it's not a morphe one this is a
Wayne Goss 0/2 brush look at this
perfection the Wayne Goss brushes are
just the highest one of the highest
quality best I've ever ever ever
experienced they are so sleek so
beautiful so soft like you see the
powder coming up honestly they're just
absolutely amazing this is uses for
underneath my eye and highlighting this
is a great having brush I used it today
to highlight the face with it
I just inked it's great honestly I love
the Wayne brushes he just came out with
the double zero breath oh my god sounds
like a brawl science double zero I'm he
just came out with the double zero brush
which is this one I like the o2 more my
personal preference this is just my teen
I just want to show you the comparison
because this is a double serum this is
the o2 like a literally took a mini baby
virgin until I get an adorable so
honestly the o2 brush is amazing if you
guys are looking for a really high
quality brush great for sending
underneath the eyes great for powdering
little spots of the face specifically or
highlighting the face the o2 brush you
cannot go wrong by Wayne nice lovely
honestly like um if I ever visit into
the UK Oh Wayne Gus you better hide from
me bitch because I'm coming for you I'm
just came that's so dirty uh sorry and
that's okay next I'm gonna talk about
they use really quickly I want to bring
up the new velour lashes I'm wearing for
lower lashes right now I think velour
just recently launched 3d silk lashes
which are so amazing I love you saw you
so you guys know that I love
fellas fellas are my favorite lashes of
all time they are 3d mean clashes the
Lord just launched 3d silk lashes which
are great because if you guys are not
interested in using mink I know a lot of
people are not a lot of people are
really not about that I mean Clive but
they want that mink effect this is
what's gonna give it to you I'm wearing
fluffing dolled up
fluffing dolled up because this is
called I think it's like their fluff
line
I think that's literally what it's
called Victor fluff line you can find
the velour fluff in lashes at Sephora I
just think they're absolutely amazing I
think that velour is such a cool brand
I love lashes and the fact that they're
doing 3d silk ones is so badass like not
a lot of brands are getting into the 3d
silk right now and velour is jumping on
it and not only do they jump on it
they're inside Sephora and they're
exclusive to Sephora so that's really
cool like congrats to you guys velour if
you I don't know if you guys whoever
wants us but congrats to you guys for
doing this and doing it with Sephora
that's so bad-ass congrats you
guys
I don't have a code with them or
anything sorry guys maybe maybe it may
be in the future I want to talk about
the Mac Melba blush Mac Melba Melba is
literally just the perfect pinky peach
blush I think it's absolutely insanely
beautiful it's a matte blush I'm wearing
it today on my face and I cannot get
over how much I love Melba like and this
whole time month I've been using this
bitch non-stop like stop in no no it's
about it's from Mac so it's really
easily accessible for to you guys I know
I don't use like a lot of Mac stuff but
when I do find stuff from Mac that I
love I like freakin love it because it
is so easily accessible for not only
mean for you guys as well and I think
that Melba is a staple blush I'm sure
everyone watching has Melba I'm pretty
sure I'm just really late on the train
Mac does beautiful blushes check out
Melba it is sickening the other cheek
item I want to talk about really quickly
oh my god that was so fast whoa whoa the
other cheek item I want to talk about
really quickly I'd use this already in a
video but I wanted to talk about it
again because it is so good is the
colour-pop super shock cheek and
electric slide I am living for this
highlighter like I'm living honestly
I've been using this as my base
highlighter for my highlighter on top of
my face
I love golden intense highlights so this
coming POW being like a mousse II
creamier texture underneath my
highlighters that I put on top of it
like the powder ones it's just been
amazing this entire month I mean that's
all I've been doing and I think the only
like eight bucks or like ten bucks or I
don't know how much they are but
they're just really great and
the colour-pop for making such a
sickening cast highlighter I sir she has
a highlighter base you cannot go wrong
on you again
you're really an the last but not least
our three lip items I've been loving
this month if I get too soon passes
don't member favorites okay so these
three h1 talked about really quickly
because I absolutely have been loving
them this entire month and I've been
wearing them non-stop religiously all of
them first ones first is the dose of
colors bear with me it's like one of the
newest liquid lipsticks that they just
launched honestly I almost wore it in
today's video because I wanted to wear
it so bad but I'm like no man you'll be
different wear a brown lipstick but I
almost wore this I'm not kidding me just
watch it and show you guys what it looks
like it is the most beautiful warm muted
pink you have ever seen mmm this is what
it looks like it is it's stunning it's
literally a new dish warm pink it kind
of honestly like honestly it kind of
looks like serenity a little bit if you
have serenity don't buy this to be
honest like not show me bitch it is
pretty similar it's not identical
obviously but it is really similar to
serenity but those are the tones I love
tones like this are like what get me
going like I love shades like this I
also love the formula of this two dose
of colors are one of my favorite liquid
lipsticks that's ever been out I love
their formula to death sickening dose
love you okay this is just a staple this
is a staple I wanted to quickly talk
about Lolita by Kat Von D I know you
actually be like what the we know
about Lolita I know but I have been
loving this shade as of this month
I mean I've used it before in the past
and loved it but I had the lipstick form
I never really had the liquid lipstick
form now if I had the liquid lipstick
I've been like wearing it like
religiously let me swatch it next bear
with me this is what it looks like
Lolita right next to it Lolita I know
has gone through like like three formula
changes it's been cray
but this is just a beautiful warm mommy
tone it has like that warmness to it so
it's not any a school tone is not gonna
be as purple as the other like mommy or
like Veronica for example by Anastacio
but it's absolutely beautiful if you
guys like warmer moppy tones you're
gonna love Lolita I know everyone talks
about it I don't know why I'm even bring
it up to be honest but I've been loving
it this month I know this is like a hot
item like they're hard to find but if
you guys can't find it try it out it's
sick and my last but not least lip item
is going to be MAC lipstick in myth Oh
myth you mother missing mother I'm not
really good swatching to my left I've
discovered that right now and this is
myth on the side of here it is literally
like the lightest nude color that I own
in all of my lipstick collection myth is
like the lightest one it's a basically a
very beautiful nude color with a pinkish
undertone which I love I don't like nude
colors to have a yellow undertone
because if you look kind of like
jaundice II and I am I good I try to
avoid those colors but myth is so
beautiful it has like that peachy pink
undertone which is why I like it so much
and I wear myth all the time I wear it
in my own like vlog video recently when
I was a benefit we're myth all over my
lips and it just looks so good and it's
just it's a staple it's a staple
lipstick if you're darker in complexion
you're definitely want to use a darker
lip liner to go with this because it is
the lightest nude color ever and it
could look like concealer on your lips
real quick which I'd remind I really
don't mind that I know I really know but
if you guys don't like that people would
be weary but it is honestly such a
badass lipstick it's a satin finish and
it's from Mac easily-accessible get it
and that's it that's it for my entire
