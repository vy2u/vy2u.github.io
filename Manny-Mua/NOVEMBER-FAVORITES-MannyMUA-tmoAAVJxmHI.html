today's video is going to be my November
favorites
you guys know favorite videos I say it
every video are some of my favorite
videos to film there's just so much fun
and I love just sitting back and talking
to you guys about products I've been
living for this past month and every
month I've done it you know what I mean
November was a big travel month again
for me so I don't have a tons of
products here but the ones I do have are
ones that work to me so much so
that's what today's video is going to be
as always if you guys don't like this
video if you guys don't like me please
don't watch it you know the joy
of that but you guys like this video
please subscribe to my channel if you
weren't already and if you're new what's
up I'm an emu and welcome to my channel
thank you so much for being here I
really appreciate it but let's go and
get into this November favorites video
before I start rambling on about
something that I shouldn't ramble about
okay okay so first things first I'm a
show-off with a couple of skincare items
obviously I always try to start with
skincare if I have any during the month
and this time I have to kind of well
ones kind of a skincare one no one is
placing care when on with on Tomba what
I'm talking about is the tart pack your
bags under eye rescue patches this is a
new box cuz I've already gone through a
box myself so I believe that per pack
you get a pack of four and this is what
they look like they like this really
cool one little thing they look like
they look like a little Ami's I don't
know what the they look like they
look just really weird like blue Soames
they are so great i hydrating your
under-eye area so what I'll do when I'm
flying oxy put these on in my eyes the
air is always so much thinner and much
more cold and just dry so what I'll do
is I'll put this underneath my eyes
they're clear so it's really cool that
you don't have to like there's a look
obvious like you're wearing like any eye
patches or masks or anything like that
but the one of my eye I leave them on
for 20 minutes and then I'll take them
off and my eyes feel so hydrated this is
definitely a hydrating mask it's cooling
and hydrating and so it's gonna go ahead
and fill in the fine lines of your under
eyes as well as give you just some
plumpness and life back to your under
eye area if you guys are like me and you
guys crease a lot underneath your eyes
then you're gonna really really like
these so much especially for dry oh my
gosh these work very very very well and
you get four uses per packet I don't
know I just I've been really liking them
I've been using them very often I think
they're fantastic and they're a lot
cheaper than some of the more expensive
brand alternatives if you're looking for
a good one that's not too expensive I'll
check out the Tarte ones they are really
really nice next product I have here is
a sundae Reilly oil you guys
you know Sunday Riley oils I love them I
love names so what I liked about this
oil so much is that it's a dry oil so
you use it right before you moisturize
and so this is like one of the two oils
I use every night so what it is it's a
oil for acne prone skin and I do have
very acne prone skin if you're that
person that has like acne on your face
or want to get rid of acne or help with
like subdue the acne a little bit
I would really check out this oil
because it does I've noticed that truly
I really have noticed that this oil
helps me keep acne at bay like even
right now like my skin like I don't have
any active like intensive breakouts
right now as you can see like it's not
it's not too bad
I have bumps on my skin of course I've
texture and all that but it's not
that bad this isn't oil that helps
manage and prevent acne and blackheads
one-point-five cells look in it and it
just works very well for me and I just
noticed that this month my skin has been
a lot clearer than the months prior
three drops and you're good for the
whole face it works the next item I have
is a makeup item finally I have the RCM
a no color powder as you can see I've
gone through a good amount of it like I
can't do a pretty good amount of it this
has been like my go-to powder this
entire month I've been using it all over
my face as well as underneath my eyes
it's not great at keeping my oil at bay
I need to use like the Laura Mercier in
my t-zone to keep it like not oily but I
have noticed that when I use this it
gives you like such a beautiful finish
on your face especially underneath your
eyes as well as like around the
perimeters of my face when I want to
look a little bit more natural I suppose
as well as natural as well covers can be
bitch like come on
I guess Naturals I can be cuz there's
just full coverage all the time
and it's just very lightweight it's very
thin and it's very great and not picking
up on my dry patches as well cuz I do
have dry patches in certain areas of my
face and I know that like Kathleen like
started this craze of this powder and
it's been everywhere and I've seen so
many people use it and now I understand
why I've been using every single day at
the month of November and I really does
make a huge difference when it comes to
the appearance of my skin I'm wearing it
today and I have a only on I don't have
any Laura Mercier powder on it all and I
feel like a clean skin look less heavy
the Laura Mercier powder makes my skin
look very heavy and really intense which
is great because it does stay on a lot
longer
like I'll keep it off like 12 hours and
I'll be okay but this one just gives you
a beautiful like lightweight finish and
it's really inexpensive too it's like 12
bucks so it doesn't check out the RCM a
powder oily dry combination any
a kind of skin I think you guys will
really like this powder it's pretty
 good next thing I wanna talk
about is the Kevin a Kwan medium
sculpting powder it's just a really nice
cool tone of brown as you guys can see
right here it's a very cool tone it's
not neutral it's not warm it is cool
that she just that is go tone that is
golden it's smooth it's lightweight it's
not powdery it's just a really nice
powder at contouring the face I don't
use this like as a bronzer I do not put
this all over my face putting in areas I
want to bronze up my skin this is only
specifically going on the contours on my
face I was underneath my chin like right
here just kind of snack that
gobble right up it works fantastic I put
about my hairline a little bit kind of
expensive not gonna like but it does
work very very very well and it really
is a nice cool tone color talking about
face contour I've been using this month
the why 9 brush by morphe this is the
from their new like gold collection I
think it comes out on like Black Friday
hey don't even know I've been using a
lot for contouring because of the size
the size of this brush is so great look
at the size of my face and look at the
size of this brush look
are you kidding like if you're looking
for a nice contour brush that's very
fluffy but still compact a lot of
product and puts it down very nicely as
well as blends look no further it's just
such a great size look at it it's fluffy
come on it's fluffy it's dense it's just
a great contouring brush great at
getting every spot of the face come on
you guys have a larger faces I know it
sounds so weird but he had a larger face
like I do not saying that your man I
mean if your man great but if you're not
it's great to if you have a larger faces
that you and you find that brushes that
are small like just don't really work
for you as much just check out this
brush it just works very well for my
type of face shape and size it just
contours literally perfectly I do not
need to look any further that I know
this brush will be a staple in my
collection from now on and it's already
going in my like go-to bag so I'm like
that's what I know if it if it's going
in my travel bag that's what I know it
actually works for me very well
so why 9 fantastic another controversial
wanna talk about really quickly is the
why 18 this is such a small perfect nose
contour brush look at this you see this
so I use today to contour this nose so
you can see it's fluffy but it's tapered
and it goes up like this and it tapers
to like almost like a point but it's not
to point see words like it won't blend
it's still a blood nice
Conte or if you're into nose contouring
at all whether it screams with powder I
would just suggest this brush I've been
contouring recently like the sides only
nostrils to make them a little smaller
just kind of pinching it in slightly and
again picks up product great deposits
product great it's just you can't go
wrong and the last product that I'm
gonna be talking about this month has
been the Kylie cosmetics dirty peach lip
kit this is lip I'm wearing right now
it's just I don't know what it is I'm
not really a big fan of peach lipsticks
but for some reason this lipstick has
been sticking with me and I've worn it
several times this month and I think it
looks so pretty it's a warrant Jeffries
video like a while back when we did the
vagina highlighters review and a lot of
people are asking what lipstick I was
wearing when I had like the full matte
face and just this lipstick and just
like a wing and it looks so pretty and I
chinking complements a lot of skin tones
it's gonna look great on target
complexions like complexions and meeting
complexions it's just a beautiful
complementary color because it is peach
but it's not to like - peach where you
look like sickly you know I mean like
have you guys seen those like yellow
peach tones are like like you're like
not looking healthy this is not that
this is like a nice warm peach tone and
don't get me wrong I'm not the biggest
biggest fan of Kylie's formula of liquid
lipsticks I love her lip liners the lip
liners give me life in prison with a
bitch realness love obsessed but the
lipstick formula themselves it's just
not my favorite I just dry out really
easily on me and I feel like they kind
of crack in the center here so I'm
rubbing it to try to like make it look
even it'll flake off so I don't like
that so when I wear it I will do the
entire lip liner first and then I'll do
the liquid lipstick and it lasts a lot
longer it looks a lot more beautiful
when you have a base but I just been
loving this color so much I just like
this ring here I like that but that's
just my lip can tell you anything about
my own anatomy and yeah guys
that's it for my entire November
