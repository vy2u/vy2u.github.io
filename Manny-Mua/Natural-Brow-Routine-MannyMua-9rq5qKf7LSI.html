today's video is going to be my everyday
brow routine this is the brow routine
that I go to all the time this is what I
do at an event or if I'm just going out
to do something this is the brow routine
I like to do it's what I'm wearing right
now
um it's my bra I said I'm wearing is
what I have on it's definitely much more
on the natural side it's definitely not
as fleek as other people like to do
their brows I'm I used to be really into
that fleek like I was into that
fleek this I wanted to carve a bitch how
I wanted to be super long I want it to
be cut at the end super sharp but I've
really been getting into the more
natural brow more just naturally filled
in brow so this is the routine that I
like to do right now I could definitely
film a more flukish brow routine because
I'd like to do that too sometimes but
this is what I'm into right at this
moment and I think it looks really
really nice and it's not hard to do it's
super super super easy however this is
for people who have more of a filled-in
brow this is definitely me I do I have I
have brows like i'ma do my brows aren't
very sparse so keep that in mind you can
definitely modify to make it however you
need it to be but this really works for
me great and this is my routine so I
hope you guys enjoyed this video if you
guys don't like this video because I
like me don't watch the video
you guys know the drill with that but it
guys do like this video and you guys do
like me please like this video and
subscribe to my channel if you aren't
already cuz I would really really really
appreciate that but yeah that's going to
get this bad boy done this brow routine
done only the brows the face won't be
not in the sabbatical alright well so
we're gonna go and start this brow
routine this is actually a super super
super easy routine this is the routine I
use this is my more updated brow routine
obviously as you can see from the title
this is my updated brow routine video
which is my more natural brow routine
natural natural is it natural I don't
know I mean it's not a fleek cut brow
okay close the first things first the
lid is not primed whatsoever as nothing
on the lid there's a little bit of like
excess foundation for my Beauty Blender
but that has nothing there so first
things first what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna take the Becca concealer just like
a little pot it's a little pot like this
in the shade banana this is what I use
personally um Studio Fix from Mac works
really great a Mac Paint Pot will work
really great I just like to use a very
viscous intense concealer or Paint Pot
of some sort for this part of the brow
which is we're gonna use to like kind of
carve out the brow it just kind of helps
also cover up little like sparse little
hairs that are being like a little bit
really hey look at me what are using a
really dense concealer like this it's
going to help kind of cover those up so
that's what I only use and I'm gonna
take that on a more feet m42 one which
is my favorite concealer brush of
all-time this is like my favorite detail
brush the coat than it is it's extremely
thin it's extremely small fantastic I
doing detailed work like this I have
concealer on the brush already I make it
I made it flat I'm gonna start at the
arch of my brow and I'm really gonna
conceal underneath the brow all the way
up to the hair okay so let me just show
you guys I'm talking about right here
I'll put like a good amount on the
actual skin before I start going up to
the brow first cuz you never know how
much is on the brush you just never
 know okay so then start to
getting closer and closer to the hair
I'm gonna kind of push out the product
pass the brow kind of flicking it
upwards and then just use the rest of
the product on the brow to kind of
feather it forward this morphe brush
makes it so much easier trust me what
I'm starting to get towards the front of
the brow I really actually start to like
to cover little brow hairs I have here
you can see like I'm literally coming up
brow hairs right here and then any
excess I have on the brush I'm just
gonna kind of blend it down from the
brow bone just really press it in you
want to blend it so it doesn't look so
harsh and I'll take my finger and really
just press in that concealer or kind of
blended downwards as well like that so
okay so as you can see already this brow
looks much more clean than this prepa
does this brow looks a little more not
as arched and a little bit lower than
this one just because not only is the
concealer brightening the eye and
lifting it up it's also making it look a
lot more clean and carved out even
though I didn't even put product in the
brow yet so this is just a really great
way of cheating the system and making it
look like your brows a lot higher a lot
more arched and a lot more clean is by
using concealer or something really
dense this is what I like to do so you
can see it's looks like this so now that
we've got the detailed work with the
concealing and with the carven I'm not
going to take the benefit gimme brow
it's a really small adorable little
thing what it's like going from super q
I'm taking this in the shade medium deep
I'm gonna use this at the beginning of
my brow I'm really gonna help just kind
of comb up the brow hairs I'm just kind
of continuing that product I'm not
dipping it again I'm just continuing it
out towards the tail of my brow if you
have more full brows this is such a
great way to fill them in quote-unquote
fill them in without having to actually
use a pencil up until I get to the arch
where I'm about to hit the arch I
stopped using the benefit product and
then I'll go ahead and take the anasazi
of brow gel in the shade chocolate
sometimes
which I'll switch between chocolate and
espresso whatever I have near me it
doesn't really matter I really like that
rule of thumb it's like you can go two
shades lighter or two shades darker with
your brow than your hair so I just
follow that rule and at the arch I'm
gonna go ahead and start putting in this
chocolate color to kind of give more
life to the hair and kind of blending it
forward a little bit to blend that into
but I'm really concentrating the
majority of the product on the tail
because of you guys could notice I have
a lot more sparseness by my tail of the
brow so I really want to concentrate
more product there and essentially fill
it in with brow gel instead of having to
fill it in with product and you have a
filled-in
high arched brow on this side without
having to use brow powder or without
using a pencil just brow gel and
concealer and it looks so much more
filled and more lifted and much more
clean and this is what I like to do I'm
gonna finish our eye off camera quick
and I'll be back and this is what the
eyebrows look like with just brow gel
and concealer it's really quick
great for events I just tossed this
bitch on and I'm good to go and it lasts
all day because it is brow gel and yeah
this is what I like to do what do you
think and this is that from far away
kinda and yeah that was it for my entire
brow routine this is my current routine
this is what I like to do stays on the
face all day it will not budge it is
brow gel so it feels like little like if
you look like kind of hard on them
having to sell weed and it just
it works it works with me it totally
works to me if this doesn't really work
for you you definitely need to modify it
to your kind of need but let me know if
you guys want to see me do a more fleek
brow routine or more routines just in
general if you guys want to see more
like routine videos or whatever you guys
