today is going to be my full coverage /
natural full coverage side of things I
love to do full coverage I wear full
coverage all the time especially when I
go out to events or when I'm doing mean
Greer's anything to do with makeup I
like to go out in full coverage because
I need you to ask me all freaking day
and this is the routine I use it
slightly excessive I like my full
coverage to be a little bit more on the
natural side as natural as well covers
can be like let's be honest love yeah so
this is my kind of full coverage routine
this on my lips as you guys know I can't
I can't stop serenity no I won't stop
won't but yeah if you guys want to see
how I got this full coverage look on the
face please continue to watch if you
guys always kind of if you guys don't
like me don't believe have you guys do
like me and you guys do like this video
please give it a thumbs up like it and
subscribe if you guys aren't subscribed
to me already I really would appreciate
that so much
yeah but let's go and get into this full
coverage natural full coverage glam kind
of luck yeah okay let's do this end if
I'm going to start this video with a
barefaced on obviously this is gonna be
a full coverage natural full coverage
foundation routine that face needs to be
completely clear whoa like clean you
know you don't think it needs to be
nothing on a besides moisturizer I'm not
going to take the makeup ever step one
equalizer in the smoothing I'm gonna put
that in the center of my face this just
really helps me smooth out any of my
pores or any imperfections I have on the
face so I'll put that in areas that I
kind of crease a little bit more and
where I get a little bit oily because it
does have silicone in it so it's and
help with oil really nicely too then I'm
gonna going with these Smashbox primer
water this it's just a great priming
spray I mostly use this for the rest of
my face not really for the center
because I already do have the primer in
the center this is just to kind of help
grasp onto the foundation I'm going to
go in with it really does help with a
longevity of my makeup when I have the
primer water on I don't know what it is
about it but they makes it a little bit
more tacky my face a little more tacky
so it clings to my face slightly more
the foundation will cling to it a little
bit more so I think that's good
that's what you want okay so two one
start with the foundation so I'm gonna
go ahead and use these are the
foundations I'm going to be using them
to use all three of them this part is
very excessive at your you definitely
don't need to do what I do in this
situation this is just truly what I do
when I want to do full coverage routine
and especially if I'm going to know
better something this is what I do
because I want it to last all day
and I wanted to look good throughout the
day I'm going to be mixing the NARS all
day luminous weightless foundation the
Loreal Pro matte infallible and the dior
air flash I'll be using all three of
them first things first I'm gonna take a
little bit of the pro matte infallible
and that's just into on the back of my
hand a good little amount of that I'm in
the shade 103 I thought what I like to
use because a lot people ask me what
 I am infallible and I'm 103 it's a
little bit darker than me but I do I use
bronzer so I'm like it and what you got
on a Beauty Blender at damp Beauty
Blender now I'm gonna press that into
the center of my face only right over
the make a forever primer only in the
center of the face am I gonna be
concentrating Galleria and the reason
I'm only Queens in the center of the
face because I get more oily in the
center of the face in this foundation is
really great at controlling my oil
especially when I have on top of a
mattifying foundation primer because my
nose in my forehead like this area is
what gets really oily for me so it looks
like I just had that on and then now I'm
gonna take a little bit more of the
L'Oreal infallible and put it on the
back of my hand again I got like that
much the good ol it's a good old olive
and I'll take the weightless foundation
by NARS honestly you could go in with
just this and you will get the coverage
you want it's a great foundation it will
give you an awesome amount of coverage
but I like to mix it with the L'Oreal
luminous because it does give you a more
natural luminous finish and I'll do two
puffs of that and I'll just literally
just make some on the back man mix in
mix it and then I'll take it on the back
of my finger then I'll use my finger to
really dot it on for me with full
coverage I love to do full coverage I do
for coverage all the time but I like it
to be more of a natural full coverage
and this is just kind of what I like to
do again it's excessive but it works for
me and then just use that beauty blender
and just press it in to the skin do not
drag it like dragon thought your face
just really want to beat the mug with
the beater beat that mug I
really like to concentrate a lot of the
product on my cheeks this area right
here because I get really I have like
really intense pores like those bitches
be deep as and so I really like to
cover those up and I really like to
press the Beauty Blender in to my pores
basically is it good for your skin
probably not and then I'll take this
part of unit that doesn't have any
product on it like this little purple
spot right here and I'll press over the
spots that I get really cracky okay like
I'm talking like smile lines and like
forehead lines and things like that it
picks up a little bit of the product
onto the Beauty Blender so it really
helps dilute the product there
and it won't crease as much as usual if
you'd help take off some of the product
from the little spots that will crease
on you so anywhere that you crease try
to use a different part the beauty bunch
to pick up the excess product and you
will notice a difference I'm not even
kidding it's so cool okay now for the
deer flush this part is so not necessary
you do not need to do this whatsoever
this is just what I like to do because I
like the look okay so I'm gonna take the
jour flash shaped a bit up and I'm gonna
take it on a morphine 31
what's the flat top like kabuki the
lolly collected from morphe you guys
know I'm not stop talking about so
 good and have it good for it
many MUA anything from morphe shameless
plug affiliate code and you save 10% off
anything from or from the site I'd like
to let you guys know I'm gonna fill you
with morphe and yeah so thank you for
all the support if you guys have ever
supported me with morphe and using my
codes I really appreciate it
you really do okay so for this part I'm
gonna spray this brush what a very light
layer of the georgette flash I'm talking
like nothing and then I'm gonna
literally press the dry flash in the
spots where I want it to be a little bit
more luminous I'll put some here some
right here I'll just have to press in
that do your car flush into the face the
reason I like to do is is because I feel
like the dirt or flash mimics skin and I
love it
I love the dry flash so much it gives me
the most beautiful finish so anything I
have left on the brush I'll just kind of
whirl it around anywhere else but I feel
like the door I flush adds a luminosity
that skin would have so not only am i
full coverage but I'm starting to look
more on the natural full coverage side
so that make sense I avoid the Dior air
flash on the center of the face because
it will give me a luminous glow so I
really want to keep the luminosity
around the edges of my face to give me
more of a natural glow like a skin glow
so this is what it should look like
without any powder full coverage but
still giving a slightly luminous feel to
the skin to me it looks more on the
natural full coverage side as Naturals
full coverage can be honestly it's full
coverage you're not gonna look natural
girl I'm sorry that's just what it is
okay but I'm gonna try to get us there
so next for the under-eye concealer
which is what I do for events I'm doing
the Urban Decay Naked weightless
concealer in the shade light intro and
I'm gonna go ahead and put that
underneath the eye a good amount and
then I go take the Mac prep and prime
highlighting pen in light boost ever
talked about to come make sure my
channel before but I really love how
brightening the light blues pen is as
well as diluting the Urban Decay Naked
weightless concealer it really helps to
tell you the product as well as brighten
and keeps the coverage there I love that
love it more than life and I'll take the
damp Beauty Blender again and really
press in the product into my under-eye
and with this you really want to press
it into the skin to keep the coverage
there you don't want to like world that
bitch around because you will lose the
coverage of the concealer and most of us
do not want to lose the coverage of the
concealer so really just the excess
probably will be picked up and then it
will also deposit really nicely and
blend out under-eye very very very well
I think so this eye looks a lot more
bright and awaken under the eyes and
it's still not heavy you know I mean now
I'm gonna go and set the under-eye so
now to set the under-eye I'm gonna take
the laura mercier brightening powder the
secret brightening powder on a more p.m.
438 I always use this powder and brush
to set my under eye it just really works
and you want to do a good amount of it
not like too too too much but a good
amount to really ensure that the product
sets but you're not being too
heavy-handed with it so now it's nice
and set nice and bright on the side and
this side needs some have awesome so
that were nice and concealed and set
underneath the eye only okay so now to
set the base of our face okay we're
gonna go and take a large powder puff
doesn't matter one brand who did this
one just so happens to be the Yves Pro
one I wish I had a little like thing to
go behind it liked a little a strap it
doesn't it falls now I'm gonna go and
take the Laura Mercier translucent
setting powder and I'm gonna take a
little bit of that on the powder puff
alright let it like settle into the puff
let that bitch get into that puff like
world that little guy in there I'm gonna
go and take this pup and press it onto
the skin especially in the places that I
need to be more secure throughout the
day for example the t-zone the pores
case I'm gonna press the translucent
powder on the nose forehead and in the
pores and then whatever I have left
I'll just kind of press it slightly over
the face just to help set it the Laura
Mercier translucent powder is so good at
my favorite channels and her I've ever
used even people that are driving they
can use this powder and it will look
absolutely beautiful
on them as well won't pick up any dry
patches this is just like a take a
special powder it's like it's really
good it's really good I know
we're almost done I swear we're almost
done with the face we're gonna take the
Mac mineralize skinfinish the reason I
do this last step is to give me a skin
finish back the mineralized skinfinish
Azhar a face powder that have a slight
sheen within them so it's like the mica
powder kind of reflex so it kind of
gives you more a natural finish that's
why they're called
mineralized skinfinish I'm gonna take
that on a more Fuji zero my favorite
powder brush of life and I'm really just
gonna press
the mineralize skinfinish all over the
face this brush is so freakin soft it
feels absolutely amazing seriously like
this will give you that glowing skin
look again okay cool so it should look
something like this this is what it
looks like I'm full coverage right now
and I look kinda weird because I'm not
like bronzed and I don't have
highlighter a blush on or anything like
that but I just want you guys to see the
skin this is what it will look like I'm
going to actually do a setting spray
after I put the bronzer and highlighter
on but I'm gonna go in as if you guys in
to see what it looks like before I put
on blush bronzer highlighter and fix+
okay so it means me rising real quick so
you can see what the skin looks like up
close and personal I'm gonna do okay so
this is the skin
I am a full-coverage you can see any of
my own skin underneath this but it still
gives you a skin like reflection and I
think it looks super awesome this
routine just really really really works
for me I'm gonna go put some blush and
bronzer and contour on and then I'm
putting fix+ over the face just so I can
show you guys what it would look like
with the whole finished face done hold
on it's again and yeah this is what it
would look like with some bronzer on
wasn't highlighted with some blush this
is a foundation routine that I would
totally do an event I would definitely
go out like this
this is just a very easy way to look
full coverage and look very much a glam
but still give me a natural feel to the
skin like I sprayed these Smashbox
primer water over my entire face to set
everything in place as well as the
specialist primer water helps absorb
that excess powder to really ensure that
you don't ask cakey or powdery on the
face so yeah this is what it would look
like normally nice thing but yeah that's
it for my natural full coverage look I
hope you guys enjoyed this video this is
a very very excessive kind of tutorial
you guys definitely do not need to do
all the steps that I do this is the way
I like my full coverage to look you
don't need to do as many steps as I did
but this is just what really works for
me especially if I'm going out I'm gonna
be out for like 12 hours this will stick
on my face and despite me being oily so
this is what I like to do I hope you
guys enjoyed this video again give it a
thumbs up if you guys liked it let me
