quick video on this springy summary type
style deal look right here I use the
chocolate bar palette for most of it and
then I did sugar pill in the middle and
I have Nick's on my lips and lime crime
if you want to see how we achieve this
look keep watching that don't forget to
hit subscribe and like if you guys like
it and if not then don't watch
it what's up you guys it's the home girl
we're starting our I lick with some
prime eyes now we're going to grab a Mac
224 this is the Sigma one but ya know
what I mean it's a big fluffy black
brush and the nice light light light
brown color also no deposit that and the
outer corner we really want the most
pigment on the outer corner with this
look because our gonna be going in with
darker colors later and we want that
nice transitional color payoff hey cool
so walking in our socket circular
motions check if it's right how are we
going with a DP chocolatey color with a
217 style brush it's not 217 this is a
more fun but it's basically the same
thing it's a white hair brush that's
really dense we're gonna put that on the
outer corner as well put a little bit
lower than the other color and just rock
it into our socket again and yeah just
lower than the other color we want that
gradient
you
what you do on one side you must do to
the other of course now we're going to
learn with this champagne color right
between the two I think this just
marries the look beautifully we're gonna
really hack that guy onto our labels
little flat brush
this one's from unique I was sent to me
so it's pretty pretty cute so it's cute
little brush is very light and I'm
pulling my eyelid taught a little bit
because I want to get a really good
color payoff of this guy and I feel like
that gives me the most payoff we're
going back in with a 217 styled brush
just to blend the three colors together
now we're going to go in with that nice
of maroon color the real tiny Real
Techniques brush Real Techniques brush
real tiny real tsking oh my god I can't
now we're going to really pack that on
the outer corner and blend it with that
217 again with no additional product
we're just blending that bad boy into
those two chocolatey colors first that
we first put down finding another side
get that nice really pretty color payoff
we're gonna go in with that white next
on a flat brush just kind of highlight
the brow bone it's more of a matte color
so let's have a lot of shimmer going on
I'm just more going with a matte
highlight on the top get that chocolatey
color put down the bottom lash line make
the weird faces you know the deal
now we're going with some love love
lashes and sexy kitten they're my
favorite right now hey I'm so so so
sorry that I it didn't record when I was
putting the yellow and my inner
tear-duct it literally just clicked stop
and it didn't record me applying the
butter cupcake from sugarpill and inner
corner but I just use a really tiny
packing brush and I just pack that
real heavily on inner corner okay sorry
about that guys and yeah this is my
final look guys hope you guys liked it
keep watching if you guys do so if you
guys want to keep if you want to keep
gonna keep me keep watching
no lashes of my life right now I'm gonna
use my look

 trying to show you

 is keep going from you ain't gonna
