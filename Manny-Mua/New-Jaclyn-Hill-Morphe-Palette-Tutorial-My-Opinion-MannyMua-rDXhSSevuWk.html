today's video is going to be a video
dedicated to the new Jaclyn hill
favorites palette with morphe cosmetics
muffin brushing runway hmm so basically
Jacqueline and morphe brushes collab
together and they made this beautiful
let's just think about her face is on
the back oh you're something woman we
post okay hold on did I get it
probably not so this is what it looks
like it is beautiful and sexy okay let's
be honest it's like it's that like
plasticy BH Coastal Scents kind of
packaging which is not my thing right
it's not it's definitely my favorite but
the quality of the shadows are not
nearly like that they're much much much
better it comes with 28 I shadow so when
you look at it right away you think war
you think really pretty
all these that's what I think I love the
way this how it looks I think it's
absolutely amazing
like what what
thank you fucking go yeah I think that
they're great I think they're very
buttery I think they're very creamy I
think they're such a freaking thing for
your butt dude like they're seriously
they're two bucks each
oh my god I cannot open pee there you go
and the retail value I think is going to
be $28 so I think that's freaking bomb
like for the what you're getting the
quality that you're getting like that's
basically a doubler shadow like what but
Jacqueline and morphe did an amazing
amazing amazing job with this like I
can't even I can't believe that this
palette is $28 it's as good as it is
it's creamy its buttery it's absolutely
amazing I don't usually like shadows
that are in this kind of packaging so I
always there ready chalky they're not
pigmented and it just annoys the shit
out of me but um they found a way to
make the shadows absolutely amazing
creamy buttery and I absolutely love
them and I really hope that you guys do
try to get it um I know that it's
releasing tonight at midnight
um it's New Year's Eve today I don't
know Jacqueline Hill has a code for more
feet I have a code as well - Manny and
you weigh in all caps
I'll leave my code down below if you
guys are interested it's just you get
you save 10% I'm not forcing you guys to
use my code or anything that like I do
get a small tiny baby Commission off of
it which is great because I ok might as
well see right now I actually just chose
my last day working in Mac for um as a
freelancer so as a right now I do not
work I'm a cosmetic so of course I would
appreciate any type of Commission or
anything lying about but I'm to the
point now in my social media work I can
actually stop working in back so I'm
really really really really excited
about it and I just want to say I
couldn't do this without you guys
genuinely honest to god I literally
could not do the study guys like I don't
talk about it because you know how I get
I get emotional with that stuff but I
just want to say thank you guys so much
for that and if you guys use my code I
really I really genuinely appreciate it
and it's a great palette and I think
that you guys need to buy it and
especially because at midnight it
releases I know this bitch is gonna sell
out as Jacqueline Hills name on it
anything that that Jacqueline talks
about so though you guys know this by
now so she her having a palate levar V
for being $28 huh ones are only good so
you guys need to watch out for that and
you guys
get it as soon as it goes up I just
wanna say a personal like signed on to
Jacqueline Hill I just say how proud I
am of you for all the things that you've
done with your career and honestly
Jacqueline Jacqueline's one of those
people do that like people in the beauty
world and you like to be like Jacqueline
is just she's kind she's caring she's
giving she's genuine she's smart we
trust her like us Watchers trust
Jacqueline and we trust her opinion and
so you know that Jacqueline would never
put out a product or palette or
something that she didn't fully back
100% and I truly believe that's why
she's been so successful because she's
never plugged a product that she doesn't
like she's never not been loyal to us
you know what I mean she's on this
amazing like fine line between like
making a lot of money and not ever
selling out and you know what I mean and
so that's just that's what everyone
that's what I want to do you guys like
that's what I want to because I want to
be like that you know I'm never gonna
fuckin sell up to you guys I'm never
gonna freakin talk about a product I
don't love just because people want to
pay me a certain money you know and so I
think that Jacqueline is the epitome of
like what I want to be in the male form
do my own thing still wanting the cuss
and do my own fucking thing but you know
Jacqueline's cool she's cool she's cool
people I don't really know her
personally or I think that I chatted
with her a couple times on Twitter I
have friends that know her personally
but I think that Jacqueline is an
amazing person and I think that you guys
should go show support to her with this
palette and I hope you guys do and I
hope you guys buy it this video I'm not
gonna have any swatches in it because
I've already just there's already videos
up of swatches of the palette I'll link
to down below that I love watching
Kathleen lights she's one of the videos
only and then I also linked Nicole from
young wild and Polish both of those
girls I absolutely love them to death
and they crack me up so I'll go and link
the videos down below if you guys want
to see some swatches on this palette but
this video shouldn't be only a tutorial
and go show support to Jacqueline you
guys go show support tour to your fellow
YouTube Beauty peeps hope this doesn't
sound like I'm kissing anyone's ass cuz
I'm fuckin not I just love Jacqueline I
love morphine me the fuck alone
shit if you guys want to see the
tutorial on how to do this love that
we've then stay on watching and if you
don't like it don't fucking watching
cool without further ado I'll get right
to the tutorial huggers tonight your
tailor if you are and I would don't know
why Seth all right now let's start the
shenanigans with a makeable on already
cuz it's fucking 1179 night I just got
off work and then gone how to die copay
for this okay cool along with the morphe
palette we're gonna go in with this
color on a just any fat brushes of the
Sigma 1 this is gonna be our brow bone I
like like I'm trying to be really strong
and not use a transition shade right now
we'll see I'm trying not to use beaches
in corner without working like dust on
our own doesn't highlight take a very
cool tone satin color is what I would
explain that some work to do that okay
now we're gonna grab this shade right
here which is gonna be like basically
our transition color on AIM Sigma e-40
and oh my god most on my chin so we're
just gonna dust the end of the grease
and rule of cream
Tammy shadows are frickin pigmented dude
I'm so impressed with this morphe
palette now we're just gonna run into
our crease I'm using me our transition
you don't need me to to tune me with it
at all
but I don't have peaches and cream so
I'm trying to be strong
hmmm
I love this color though now we're gonna
go in with that burnt orange color on
our morphe and 4-3-3 this color is so
pigmented as it's a matte orange color
and that's when we go into our crease as
well and it's just gonna help to warm it
up a little bit
look oh well they blend out I'm
impressed with you guys oh you know
remember else I like it
now we're gonna grab this dark like
plummy brown color same brush and that's
going to go a little bit lower into our
crease and this is gonna be what's that
a nice definition on the other corner
like these one I like it a lot I push
that bitch and then and then grab that
same Sigma e-40 and then just blend
through we're gonna go in and we're
gonna go ham we're going with this like
cranberry the sugary cranberry color
unlike any kind of pencil brush and that
we're gonna run on our lid writing so
that dark brown color
that's cute that's fucking cute
right up into the brown it's our accent
color you know and then we're gonna go
in with that same morphe brush that
blending brush and just kind of blend
out those edges I really don't want that
much of this pink to show I really don't
I just want to be a very very very
subtle hint of pink on my lid so now
okay the little subtle pop of pink we're
gonna grab a flat brush we're gonna grab
this intense ass white dish highlight a
section marine shimmery shade on a Sigma
D 57 firm shader and that's gonna go on
our lid there's gonna be like our
shimmery highlight and then we're gonna
put a lot of that over that pink
I want that paint to show through that
much just pack it on and on the inner
corners as well as a nice highlight and
go back in with that morphe brush and
just kind of blend out those edges so
now as you can see we have that subtle
pop of pink right there but it's not too
heavy but it's something that it's a
mess we really be looking at you and be
like oh I'll be trestle pink like it
next cosmetics jumbo pencil in black
bean getting better using this bitch
every single Z okay now we're gonna grab
a sigma e 20 and we're gonna kind of
buff out that black bean color and then
i'm gonna let something fun I don't like
that basic shit it's not my style we're
gonna grab a pencil brush and then we're
going to go in with this cool pinkish
plum color I'm gonna run that over the
black oh my god what this turns out ugly
never can forgive myself yes
oh this bitches him until aren't you
fuck a little on I just really buff it
out so it looks something like this so
let's go and grab my morphine gel liner
our black bun it's my favorite at the
moment and my Sigma winged liner brush
I've actually never used to him
so load that bitch up and let's do our
eyeliner however you want to do it I'm
just gonna doing my fucking
