today's video it's gonna be a New Year's
Eve fun festive look that we have going
on right now umm so many people so many
people requested for me to do a New
Year's Eve look and so I was thinking
like Shani I feel like a lot of people
do New Year's even looks you know I mean
and so I was really surprised when I got
a bunch of requests to do a New Year's
Eve look and so I was like dude why I'm
a doing years of look but I wanted to
make it a little bit different let's do
like more of the taupe either like cool
toned purple wasn't on Stewarts and
glitter liner and things like that so I
feel like this look is very very very
very perfect and awesome for um New
Year's Eve especially if you guys are
going you guys want to look glum yeah I
think this is a such a great look for it
if you guys want to see how I achieved
this look keep on watching and if you
guys don't like it don't watch I
think that someone watch a boy putting
on makeup don't watch it that's all
but that further newb it's just you guys
see the tutorial and I hope you like it
so we're starting off with the face
completely done already well not
completely I don't have highlighter I
don't have blush and I don't have my
lips done and I'll say what does that
work my lips in my face done um but I
don't want to waste any time so let's
just go right into the eye is cool I'm
feeling real full coverage today I'm
almost full coverage but zoom your asses
in for the thing my eye backs today
though can we just talk about them and
how terrible they look it's like
my ologies were acting up so bad today
something itches and scratching and now
I have little bands my bags have been
but at least there should know okay so
we're gonna go ahead and start we're
gonna use beaches and cream by making
you guys know but you know what this
color this is my favorite transition
shade transition chains are always just
so much better to put down first before
you put down other shadows if I'm a bro
so we're gonna grab a sigma e40 as per
always I'm gonna run that right into our
crease you don't even mean it with this
color at all these are transitions so
boom but that should down see how
there's not that much clear there but
it's gonna be great other transition
this is easily one of my favorite
transition shades of all time and it's
only six dollars and it's just it's so
so good makeup geek shadows are
absolutely amazing now we're gonna
actually go in we're gonna do a mixture
of two colors we're gonna go in with
Anasazi Beverly Hills birkin eyeshadow
mixed with makeup geek Barcelona Beach
which is a great tone because this is
definitely gonna be more on the cool
tones side I really wanted to mix those
two colors because it's very one is more
on the warm side once more on the cool
side but I'm not a fan of doing only
cool tones on the heights I don't think
that they compliment eye is too too too
much so we're just gonna run that into
our lower crease with this Sigma e30 8
which is a basically a much more dense
smaller version of the e-40 and now
we're just gonna run right into the
crease area a little bit lower than the
beaches and a home color I hope they
learn from me like I hope that you guys
like actually learning some you
know I don't want to just be like that
funny bitch I want to be like Vegas to
learn I'm doing and we're gonna take
that out a little bit and then we're
gonna go back in with that u4t and
really just blend out those colors so
there's no hard lines or transitions and
of course I'm already primed I'm prying
on the eyelids already just so you guys
know I already went in with my
primer before I started this so don't
you worry Mama's primed okay so now we
have that down and blended out or any
and all gone we're gonna go in with
Anasazi Beverly Hills by shadow in a
beauty mark which is a basically like a
deep dark plumbing Brown and it's
actually one of my favorites of the
entire Anastacio eyeshadow collection
there it's oh so beautiful we're gonna
take that in a morphe m43 3 I've talked
about this brush so much as my when my
favorite morphe brushes I own it's so so
good and this beauty mark we're just
gonna place in the outer corner we're
running it into our outer corner right
here and we're gonna take that a little
bit into the crease not too far in
though very very lightly and we're just
gonna really kind of buff it outwards I
wanted to have a nice definition on the
outer corner I'm really focused in I'm
blending out the outer corner to give us
that nice winged out shape having the
darker colors out here is gonna really
give you that elongation you're warming
and the eye shape and giving you that
lifted I look so as you guys can see
from me I'm putting it right on top of
money but because I have hooded lids
kind of something right above that so
even when my eyes are open there's still
darkness here and that's what I really
wanted to go for and then grab by you 40
blend out color
mm-hmm we're getting somewhere now we're
starting to get to the funds yet we're
going in with mesmerized by makeup geek
it's one of the new clothes that they
launched it's a topi shimmer but like
topi shimmer on crack so we're gonna go
in with that on the 320 brush by morphe
which is a fantastic packing brush cos
it's so tiny and so dense I'm gonna put
that right on top of the eyelid just
right on the eyelid guys just go right
out of it my god I never do like topi he
like eyes like this like this is this is
new for me guys this is new we're gonna
put it right up to those transitional
colors that we have down right up in
there leave pack in the taupe this is
very similar to Mac satin taupe but a
much it's like a much more intense
version of it so which I love and then
I'm gonna grab that same M 4-3-3 and
just kind of buff out the edges of that
taupey color I don't want it to be any
harsh edges or anything like that yeah
yeah spinach mm-hmm so would you look
something like that
okay awesome you're actually gonna do
the liner on this guy right
now could we come okay so basically were
gonna do it we're got the morphine gel
liner and a sigma angled a winged liner
brush and we're gonna do a little wing
on the outer corner and this is gonna be
like basically the shape for our liner
that we're doing so we're gonna do our
wing liner so what we're gonna do is
start from the bottom lash line going
outwards flick it boom and then we're
gonna drag inwards so we have this kind
of negated wing going on right now so we
have that nice wing out here and now I'm
just kind of filling in to make the line
a little bit thicker in the inner part
of my liner okay I hope you guys can see
that I'm in focus
bitch be in focus come on so that's
gonna be the base of our look so now
we're gonna go in with the violet boss
glitter and Venus eight with the vasila
clean design it's a three can you see
the only ball maybe it's like a 3d
glitter as a bunch of reflex of every
different color and we're gonna
basically make our own little glitter
liner do that mix concoction on a Sigma
waterline line brush and the glitter
glue and we are adhesive so we're just
literally gonna press that in all over
the spots where you want a glitter liner
glitter glue a fused first you came just
keep loading it up as I'm getting closer
to the inner corner I am doing a lighter
and lighter pressure because I wanted to
kind of be a like a faded eyeliner how I
know would normally go I want to be a
little bit less product for the front of
the high so you should have something
like this is glitter liner no my lashes
aren't like covered in glitter though ah
see so I'm gonna go to the other eye
real quick and I will be right back to
finish the whole thing with you guys
okay so now that we have both eyes done
I think they're pretty good god this
look is so damn easy I swear to God
assign do my right side have to already
knew I was doing literally it took me
like three minutes tops so how would you
the bottom of the lash line we're gonna
grab our neck
jumbo pencil in black bling-bling black
me and that we're gonna run underneath
our eye can you see mine focused on okay
I'm gonna focus
we're gonna try to work around the
fucked-up-ness of that okay we're going
with my makeup geek powder V brush and
we really try to focus and blend that
help we're gonna go back in with the
Anasazi shadow in Birken on that on a
fluffy brush just to run underneath that
just to really blend it out
it's so cool tonight we're gonna go back
in with that beauty mark eyeshadow by
Anasazi and now we're gonna see one take
on same brush and that's gonna go in the
outer corner over eyes just the outer
corner and we're just keeping on the
outer corner cuz I still wanted to look
a little bit more open on the center
Center with the hot towards the front of
the eye did I just close my mirror when
I need it don't this is a bitch to open
you guys don't need to be zoomed in with
a freaking lash curling okay so let's
curl those lashes give it a good one too
please boy lashes will you curl for me
come on come for daddy we're gonna do
the Too Faced better than sex mascara
that we're just gonna do a month kara
I'm so normal today I feel so like I
didn't drink that much Diet Coke today
I'm very chill and very normal like an
actual human being I'm not crazy I don't
know
then we're gonna do why so baby doll
mascara on the bottom and I think since
I'm using it for the bottom is because
they're just it's so great at getting at
the bottom getting half the fun of it so
good at getting the bottom lash line
getting the bottom lashes okay so for
the lashes were gonna go in with SC Ito
lashes in the style while eyelashes were
should I talked about them in my
unboxing video no I did not
there are mink lashes that have flare up
at the end they give you these really
nice elongation to the eye because it
gives you that def flirtiness at the
outer corner so they're really really
really really really nice so we're just
gonna go ahead and load our duo up
whenever I'm using mean clashes I'm
always so careful with the duo like I'm
like I do the little bubble here and
then I'll press the bubble okay
the lashline never be too heavy and the
Biggles mean clashes ain't cheap
Darnell this person I'll be like 30
something dollars so because we packed
on the glitter so intensely like I'd
really pressed on the glitter with the
adhesive i packed on very heavily um I'm
gonna just go ahead and put the latches
right on top of it because I know that's
still gonna stick because I really I
made it basically into a glitter liner
it's not I'm gonna like really come up
so let's I'm gonna do can I speak too
soon Thank You eschewed Oh Ferdy flash I
love them wash uh smell that we got the
lashes on I feel like just makes the
look tell me doesn't doesn't it not make
don't look like literally like a billion
times better
lovely lashes means you guys into the
final okay
did you like that is anything okay let's
go ahead and do some bullish where to go
on with make a beak spellbound blush
because I'm going with more of a cool
tone thing the whole face is gonna be
more of a cool tone side it's still pink
it's a little bit warm of a pink but I
don't like cool tones too much on the
cheek so I'm still going with the pink
like pink is still a little bit more
cool tone then orange GE brush and
that's just gonna I was about going with
the blush without having a mirror I'll
put up a blush I'm here good to me we're
gonna grab the Becca highlighter in
moonstone which is this beautiful it has
a very like nice silver reflect to it
and I think it's really really really
nice and it's in a complement this look
very well in my opinion we're just best
that onto our highlight area that's a
very cool tone highlight too which is of
what I'm going for some Becca
highlighters catch light so beautifully
like uh Thank You Jacqueline home for
always suggesting them and giving us
these beautiful tips and tricks I use
them all time so for lips we're gonna go
in with my lip liner of life it's a
brand new one I just feel so good have a
brand new NYX big blue neutral it but it
there's gonna line our lips how we
always like mmm so creamy
and then for the lipstick we're gonna go
in with jorah Cosmetics honey Buttercup
lipstick it's just I'm so in love with
this color I'm stirring it so my point
