so sorry that this video is coming to so
freaking late I've been so busy in
October guys I went to where the folks
at I go I went to Bora Bora I went to
London I went in New York I was in San
Francisco it was such a crazy-ass month
I don't even know where to begin it was
just it was such a crazy month but I did
get to try a lot of new products I've
been loving that I've been actually
traveling with so I really want to make
this video anyway I put a pull-up on
Twitter and asked if you guys wanted to
still see October favorites even though
it's coming at you a little bit late and
a lot of you guys still said yes you
guys know favorite videos are so much
fun for me to film I have so much fun
filming them for you guys and I love
talking about products that I've been
really loving and when you guys buy them
and you guys say that you love it it
makes me so happy because it's just like
I don't know it just makes me weirdly
happy that you guys actually like the
product I recommended and it's just
super super super cool and I love it
doing these videos and I hope you guys
enjoy them as well as always if you guys
want this view if you guys are like me
please don't fucking watch you know the
drill with that there's literally no
point in you watching a video of someone
that you don't like don't watch if you
guys do not like it please I implore you
do not watch this video if you hate me
don't watch it don't subject yourself to
that okay but if you guys do like this
video please subscribe to my channel if
you aren't already yeah it's going into
this October favorites video and i'ma
stop rambling on its gonna do it
okay so first things first my first
October favourites is my new setup this
as you can see this is completely
different from my old house back in San
Diego I moved I'm in LA now and I have
an entire filming room and this is a
just new setup that laura-leigh helped
me put together Laura Lee and her
husband Tyler they really killed it for
me I feel like the lighting now looks so
much better the filming setup looks
better it looks true to color like I
actually look I'm looking the viewfinder
right now I apologize I'm looking at the
u fighter like actually see like true to
color like this is what it looks like in
real life honestly it's just so nice to
have footage that actually looks like
how it does in real life you know what I
mean like my lighting now is so much
different actually have like really like
true balance like white light and it's
not like avec de lightbulbs basically
now and said like I had like weird bulbs
before and I would always have to color
correct so much to make it look like it
was even normal in any way in the video
so this is just a really cool different
setup for me I hope you guys enjoy it I
know it's different it's very very
different I'm gonna try to switch it up
as much as I can I'm gonna try to see if
I can flip everything around to get more
like a room background sometimes as well
um let me know what you guys think of it
I think it's so amazing and I'm really
really grateful that Laura and Tyler
helped me because it was a struggle for
a long time and I just really wanted to
map up everything for you guys you know
I wanted to look really pretty and I
want the videos to look great I want you
to enjoy watching them and I want you
guys to think that they're aesthetically
very nice so that's why I kind of upped
everything and I spent thousands of
dollars doing it um also you guys want I
can always link down below the stuff I'm
using I have like two Kino Flo lights
have like some side balance boards I
have like a Canon EOS 5d Mark for like
the camera I'm using so if you guys
would like to like know about like that
stuff just let me know and I can make
maybe I could put like a vlog on it I
can film like a little video on what I
use now so you guys do want to see that
let me know comment down below or like
the video if you guys want to see that
kind of things you guys wanna see like a
tour of my filming set up cuz Laura
helped me and if you guys need help I
would love to help you guys out too
because a lot of people do not a lot of
people do not want to help on YouTube
with lighting it's like a weird thing no
one wants to help you with lighting but
yeah
I wanna help my second favorite is
actually what's in my eyes right now
these are Desio innocent white contacts
I have been wearing these contacts
non-stop cuz they're just so much fun
they might be like I feel like when I'm
wearing them I feel like Prince Eric
from like
I'm romaine is that you guys like dark
hair he has blue eyes and like I just
live I literally am obsessed with Prince
Eric like you don't understand like I'm
obsessed with critera he is the man of
my dreams basically and in cartoon barn
so I honestly to think it's so much fun
wearing these blue contacts because
they're just like so different and I
feel like very vampirish with them
they're just fun to wear Jeffery wears
them Patrick wears them Laura wears them
like so much nikita where some Gabby
wears have everyone wears Desio contacts
and they're just so much fun to wear I'm
wearing the style innocent white and all
I people keep asking me like what are
the blue contacts that I'm wearing
recently and I've been wearing it on
Instagram a lot and I've been wearing
those like mean greets and events and
they're just really fun and I just think
they look really cool like it's just a
different cute look you know what do you
think like I just a they're fun and if
you guys do not like contact so if you
guys don't like the fact that I like to
change my color sometimes tough fucking
titties man because it is so much fun
and it just it's they come off who cares
you know I'm on my third favorite and
I'm sorry got a beauty product as much
yet so this is called topics it's a full
hair instantly hair building fiber spray
um it doesn't really come with this
thing it just I got sent this and it
comes with like so like yeah did you see
do you see this
no no nope all my face basically it's
like dark hair fibers and you guys know
like I'm super honest about like I don't
like my hair I think my hair is really
really thin and I want to get the like
hair surgery where it's like
everything's pulled forward I'm gonna do
it like eventually I'm in December it's
like happening I'm just letting guys
know that's a thing I'm totally getting
surgery on my hairline because I just
don't like it I've been using this a lot
recently this is basically they're just
like little fibers let me read this
topics is a made of all natural colored
keratin protein and the fibers basically
stick to your hair and make your hair
look fuller so what I'll do is I'll
literally just go like this and I'll
find spots on my hair like look I have
it right there can you guys see there's
like it's like darker here right there
in that area cuz I sprayed some topics
in it this is in the shade dark brown
there's there's tons of shades and give
him some time my mom she loves it as
well because she likes to put her hair
like a pony if she's putting her hair in
a ponytail like this and she thinks your
hair doesn't look full enough she'll
like spray you can see how just like
darkening there just spray this
and instantly your hair gets like darker
looks more full it's witchcraft
it's fucking witchcraft so topics hairy
building fibers I just I live for it so
if you guys are on the same boat as me
and do not like have to deal with like
your hair being thin or having spots on
your hair that are as full as other
areas try topics out I mean it really
does work hair building fibers I don't
know I've never heard of it and Larry
just got sent to my peel box and they're
like hey or topics you always talk about
your hair like not being the best and
being thin do you want to try this out
like here's some product and I was like
ok so I tried it and I'm live for it so
thank you two topics for sending this to
me I really appreciate it and I don't
know how ever go back look I love it ok
so let me talk about the makeup thing
really quickly because I have been
living for these this month oh my sweet
god these are the more feet pressed
pigments you guys they are so good my
favorite three are in the shades Rodeo
Drive so she can polish and mimosa
Sunday you guys just know these are the
shades I like I'm just go and just
swatch and show you how fucking amazing
these motherfuckers are at the packaging
not my favorite it's not heavy packaging
whatsoever it's a very very cheap
lightweight just let you could actually
afford the products you don't mean like
I would rather buy something cheap
packaging with the product being great
at a cheaper price you know these are
five dollars let me just show you like
you guys going to fucking die ready so
look at this so I have to look at the
viewfinder for this part because I need
to know about my focus Oh like are you
four so that was Rodeo Drive we're gonna
swatch all three because they're cooking
food so she can polish this like a
really pretty taupe champagne I know
it's stupid Rodeo Drive is a lot more
like coppery and a lot more warm so she
can polishes there's a lot more
champagne this is my number one so she
can pause if you can get any of them the
five dollars you can get any of them so
she can polish is literally life and
then I also really love mmm oh so Sunday
which is this really light light light
color Oh
no puedo no puedo out Rita okay so put
some time as a highlight let's go ahead
add a little bit me let's try it dude
come on like it's fucking sick seriously
I think the press pigments are so
freaking good and a lot of people try to
rag on me for promoting morphe products
because I love them are you serious like
I actually genuinely love the products
I'm not just doing it because I am
getting paid for it you know to me like
I'm not even getting paid by morphe like
unless people use my code I don't get
paid for them and I always tell you guys
yo need use my code so it's literally
just I like the product you know and I
have a problem with that like I'm sorry
but they they work really well for me
the swatches just don't like God it's
just it's so frustrating when people try
to rag on people for using codes like
morphe codes or like codes in any brand
you know what I mean like to me I like
having codes more than doing sponsored
videos cuz it's showing you that I like
the product and I'm actually continually
using the product and then I actually
love the brand I haven't offered so much
money to do a sponsorship I didn't like
the product or the brand and so I turn
it down I'm never gonna be dishonest
with you guys about products that I like
I truly like it I don't know I can't
like instill that into people's heads
enough some youtubers of course are
gonna be shady and do sponsored posts
and they don't like the product you know
that that's what it is we have to find
the youtubers that you like that you
trust and hopefully I'm one of them that
you do like and trust to me like truly
they do work so I can't I mean I don't
know I can't really explain that enough
like they work for me great and I hope
that they work for you great and I can
only speak off of my experience these to
me more free products worked
fantastically and I'm sorry if they
don't for you okay I really am I really
would not talk about a product if I
didn't love it and I would never put it
in my favorites if I didn't love it what
the fuck like that's fucked that is
fucked this is what I like and if you
don't like it that's your opinion too so
it's all good I love them you guys can
use my code Manny anyway if you guys
want to you do not have to I never want
you guys to think that I'm being pushy
and I want you to use my code all time
no matter what you can use anyone's code
you don't have to use good at all you
just gotta save some money so I just had
been loving these three next shadow
thing I want to talk about really
quickly is the new hardest Pro palette I
have been living for how this was
announced when we're in Bora Bora it's
just so nice this one has not been used
I want to use this one in a giveaway
honestly don't even know where the one
that's been used is I literally have no
freaking idea I would swatch a bunch of
the colors right now but again I want to
use this for a giveaway and I do not
know where my other one
is that it right there hold the fuck up
I fucking found it it was underneath my
desk across the room I don't know and I
wouldn't have not seen it unless I was
sitting in this if you like spot
whatever I found it so this is the one I
have this is the one I used it's all
jenkees fuck and like hella use
obviously as you can see 16 mattes and
for like duochrome e.type shades when I
went to Bora Bora with Tarte this is the
first thing they announce when we're
bored bored and I use it every single
day every single day awesome board where
I use this and the looks turn out so
fucking good you guys the mats they're
so nice they're so buttery and just sick
to swatch this one this one looks really
enticing uh yeah really pretty mm-hmm
I've been living for trendy oh my and
for ethereal you have the cool tones the
warms the berries you have literally
everything in this palette so I think
tart again did an amazing job on the
TARDIS pill palette and yes I did go on
the trip with them but I would not be
talking about this if I didn't actually
use it and actually loved it I just
thought they did a really banger job
with this and I know a lot of you guys
did buy it when I told you guys on my
snapchat about it and a lot of you guys
have been loving it so I'm really
excited about it and I'm so excited to
give away the other one I have to
another one I want to put into a
giveaway that I'm gonna be doing soon I
want to do like a really big awesome
like holiday giveaway soon like very
very soon
the next couple weeks I want to do
something fucking massive for you guys
cuz you guys just you guys have just
given me so much happiness I just want
to get back as much as I can I did do a
giveaway recently and it was so
successful and I want to do another one
because that's such great time this is
my last thing this is the glam glow
dream duo mask so this is the dream duo
mask by glam glow and honestly you guys
this is like my second one of this like
I'm not kidding you like I've gone
through this motherfucker I use it maybe
like three to four times a week down
like it's just it's like an addicting
mask it's one of those masks that you
like see a difference right away like
you literally like wash your face the
next day and you know what there's a
difference there so you like want to
keep using it because it's so good so
what you do is you put the is like the
pro side and so you put
on all of your skin you wait 30 seconds
let it kind of absorb a little bit and
then you put the gray layer all over on
top of it to seal it and I fall asleep
with it and I wake up my skin is so
plump so fresh
not a dry fucking spot on my face when I
do this I'm not kidding you it just
works so incredibly well I give me a
really just nice pretty hydrated just
good fucking face a good fucking face
design you make sense sound things
though this is an expensive as mask
though so I would definitely suggest
going to Sephora getting a sample of it
getting a sample of both of them just
getting like at least a sample for one
day because it only took me one day to
fall in love with this product it
actually fucking worked so well so well
if you guys have dry skin oily skin
combination skin normal skin you're
gonna love it it's going to hydrate your
skin it to make it feel very plump and
just very supple the next day like when
I wash my face the next day I literally
notice that my skin is so soft and so
like moisturized I actually feel it so
if you guys can't try out the dream duo
because I would not suggest it it's
expensive as fuck but I would not
suggest it to you there wasn't so good
if this wasn't my second jar I want to
be suggesting it you guys I promise you
a fat and that is it you guys that is it
for the entire October favourites hope
