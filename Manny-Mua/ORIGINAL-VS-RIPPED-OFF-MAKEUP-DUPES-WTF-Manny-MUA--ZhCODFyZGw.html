as you can see from today's title toys
video is going to be a fun and different
kind of video I was kind of organizing
my makeup with the other day and I came
across these two palettes these two
highlighter palettes and this actually
gave me the idea to create this video
they're actually these ones right here
it's from sleek and this one from
Technic as you can see they're literally
identical seeing that I was like wow how
do that looks like such an intense as to
do from the original which i think is
the sleek one so I was thinking to
myself I'm like wait do I have any other
products that have a dupe for them and
I'm not just talking Duke I'm talking
about like almost where it looks
blatantly copied so I found three
different products I wanted to test out
on camera to see is the original product
as good as the copied product so I
thought would be a really fun idea to
film I've never seen a video like this
before I don't know maybe someone else
has done it I have no idea but I saw
these products and I was like wait this
looks literally like a blatant copy of
the other who knows maybe it's not a
copy maybe it's just a brand came out it
and it's a coincidence I don't know I'm
not the brand I have no idea also do not
forget I have a giveaway going on on my
channel right now there's gonna be two
winners the first prize winner will get
a $500 gift card to Sephora the second
prize one will be getting a $250 gift
card to Sephora and the only rules are

there are ways I can check if you are
subscribed to me so don't treat the
system I'll leave everything linked down
below like the time it's over and things
like that so yeah let's go and get into
this video as always if you guys like
this video if you guys don't like me
please don't fucking watch it you know
the drill with that yeah but you guys do
like this do please do give this video a
thumbs up and subscribe to my channel if
you aren't already we have to all get to
this testing makeup products that have
been copied versus the other I don't I
don't know I might Alice
so the first product I wanna try out is
the highlighting palette from both these
brands I have the Technic one technique
technique I don't know strobe kit and I
have these sleek solstice palette as you
can see when you open them bitch in the
sleek one we have the lavender
highlighter the really pretty champagne
one we have this yellow gold don't have
a cream highlighter right here let's
look at the other one in the other
colors oh you know we have a lavender
highlight a peachy champagne one a
yellow gold and we have that same
lavender ii cream shade as well we're
gonna test these out on our face and
what i'm going to be using i'm going to
be testing out specifically this shade
right here and the other one is nice in
the same shade so i'm gonna swatch over
here on my hand how much I guess it
looks like this is one of the most
intense blinding as highlights I
absolutely love it so much now let's
watch the technic one hmm right off the
bat the sleek one is so much more smooth
so much creamier feeling has a little
bit more of a peachy tone to it and this
one's a little more of a cool tone
they're sleek right here and we have
Technic right there
sleek which looks a little bit more
blinding on my hand for sure more
reflective and Technic right there so
we're gonna do is we're put on our face
with the same style brush and see which
one's better taking the sleek one right
here oh how blinding this bitch was it
hello texture how you doing though and
we have the sleek one on that is with
two full layers now let's take the
Technic one same exact shade same exact
brush we're gonna pile that one on God
what if it's like really good we'll see
okay my focus okay
umm okay now we have both on we have
boom sleek right here Technic right
there technique I'm just gonna call it
technique is techniques on 'stevie sleek
right here blinding is fuck technique
pretty fucking blinding is fuck - hmm I
will say that the sleek one is a little
bit more reflective like a lot more
white and like reflection to it but the
technique one is also extremely
extremely brightening I was shook I did
not expect this to be like good to be
honest I can't even find the fucking
price on this bitch
like Amazon selling it for like 4 bucks
I don't even know personally I do like
the sleek one more it's more intense
more effective more like pow but the
technique one it worked but it's not as
good as a sleek one I mean it is four
bucks and the sleek one is 13 so for
this one I will definitely say that the
sleek one and the copy did not move on
to the next product we are going to be
testing a blush out haha so we have a
product from makeup revolution or just
revolution makeup I guess and this is
from Too Faced this is the sweethearts
blush blush let's bust these bitching oh
okay I'm screaming like I'm fucking
scream Ming do you see this shit we have
the revolution triple baked blusher
peachy pink kisses and the Too Faced
perfect flush blush and peach Beach
let's open them up we have to face right
here boom beautiful stunting wait I'm
pretty sure to face came out this first
so we're gonna test it both out on our
faith in oh my god I have to like look
at the back to even see we're gonna
swatch the whole thing right here in our
finger two-faced we have this color it's
beautiful beautiful peachy color we're
gonna swatch it the other one ah oh my
god that one feels really good and
really pigmented the middle one right
here to make a revolution one okay guys
so I just watched it we have right here
makeup revolution peach and two-faced
peach the makeup revolution one is a lot
more highlighting two things one is lot
more peachy is a lot more blush like
we're gonna be testing the original
products on this side taking a little
blush brush right here in e4 and I'm
gonna take the Too Faced blush we're
gonna put that on this side of the face
and see that's a beautiful color come on
to face god damn that's a good blush so
now organize the makeup revolution one
which is so much more high lady so weird
okay whatever
as I'm packing into the makeup
revolution one this one is so much more
powdery and so much more flaky like
there's a lot more like dust that picks
up on that one so
I basically just for highlight all over
my face yes fuck no fuck now let's see
if I can fix my face up with just please
brush away okay guys the verdict stick
to the two-faced one it was actually a
real blush it went on a beautifully
revolution triple baked blusher was
literally like a highlight all I can
type a highlight all over my cheek the
whole thing was covered and so intense
it wasn't like a pretty intense it was
like a sitting on top of your face
gross intense so the original one again
the dupe copy move I would not suggest
this one unless you guys like a very
intense shiny blush topper I would say
go for this one but if you guys want a
normal blush I could you like a really
pretty satin lifelike finish go to this
one for sure okay we are down to our
last product so this is the last
certainly certainly not least we have
the Kat Von D shade + light eye palette
and we have the makeup revolution a
revolution makeup ultra eye contour
light and shade palette come the fuck on
girl shade + light eye light and shade
eye over here same exact color scheme -
t I died too because Kat Von D like
posted on her Instagram about about this
palette saying how it was a blatant copy
and they're like riding her back and I
just thought I'm like girl you know you
know how it isn't like there was drama
online you're kind of like where's my D
F and this is D B so what we're gonna do
is I'm gonna do a really simple easy I
look just to test out some of the shades
in comparison I've already used the Kat
Von D shade light palette the eye one
it's absolutely amazing I think the
shadows are so so good and so creamy and
so pigmented it's just a great palette
honestly it's a great great everyday
palette so I'm assuming make a
revolution so I was like I wanted make a
great everyday palette - I'm just gonna
swatch a couple of these I'm to swatch
the first three feel smooth actually
shocking so got these right here is what
the three top ones feel like this is
happen I don't understand so on the
original side we're going to take like
really pretty apricot shade a little bit
of this one and that one just to kind of
mix our own custom transition shade
there's literally no denying that comedy
has some nice s shadows for real I just
dumped in to the revolution one okay I
already notice that this one is so much
more powdery okay I'm a little shook
knock online because it went on and what
I'm pretty good I definitely did the job
it blended it deposited the color even
though it was a lot powdery ER and
there's so much more kickback and I was
a lot more intense so now let's go and
just dip into this really pretty
chocolatey shade right here with this
r39
amazing amazing brush for blending
so fucking pigmented you guys the
showers do not play no there's so much
powdery or anymore and don't stick to
the brush as much but let's see how it
goes online that's what matters
okay I notice that the Kat Von D colors
are much more rich in color and they
last better this one it when you blend
it like kind of blends away though it
does blend don't get me wrong it's
definitely definitely blending okay last
step I'm gonna pack on this white shade
onto my lid this is the Kat Von D one
eye so pigmented oh I'll take the makeup
revolution sign same exact color you
guys make a revolution palette though is
so fucking chalky so much just powder M
re we're okay so definitely the
highlight e type shade on the lid is not
nearly as good on the make a revolution
side as it is on the Kat Von D side
verdict on the Shane light versus the
light and shade palette I would
definitely go with the Kat Von D shade +
light eye palette over this one did the
revolution one work it totally did like
honestly it totally totally worked you
can get definitely at the job done it's
just not nearly as pigmented and it's
much more chalky than the Kat Von D one
this one's way better if yours way
sturdier it comes with a mirror the
shades themselves blend easier they're
more pigmented they're much more rich in
color that's just my personal opinion
okay guys that's it for the entire video
because I had fun watching I had so much
fun creating this weird dupe / copied
video I thought was so much fun to film
and who knows with the brand even really
copied I have no idea it's allegedly it
just looks really copied to me my
opinion or it could be a coincidence who
knows but to me it looks like literally
a duped identical product because of any
other products that you guys have seen
out in the market that had a definite
copied makeup product dupe let me know
in the comments bar below and I'll
definitely check it out don't forget to
enter the Sephora gift card giveaway and
