today's video I am so excited to be
doing oh my god I actually have not
filmed a video in quite a minute I was
actually in Hawaii the last week and
I've just kind of been on vacation and
kind of thing in January was just such a
fun month like it was such a vacation
month for me February is not the case
I'm actually traveling so much if
everywhere I'm going to Vegas
went to New York I'm going to San Diego
I'm going to Utah potentially there's
gonna be a big month in February so I
thought I would pre film and do a couple
other things and get some shit going
anyway you guys so I actually filmed a
video a while back talking about
original verses ripped off makeup
products I will leave that link down
below if you guys don't know what I'm
talking about
basically it was me reviewing products
like the original product versus they
ripped off a dupe of the product and I
thought it would be really fun to do a
part two of that video I actually got
such a great positive feedback from the
first one so I'm like you know what
let's fuckin do it again I'm actually
really excited I got a couple items here
that I really wanted to test out and try
out just so like at least like swatch or
something to see the comparison between
the two all the Dukes items I got from
the hush app there's an app called hush
and there's like a lot of products on
there there's a lot of makeup products
that are basically like dupes for higher
end brands I'm not gonna get into it I
think about it just yeah I'll talk about
a little bit later but that is what
today's video is going to be we're going
to be talking about these dupes these
ripoffs versus the original makeup item
and we will see what do we think of the
items I've not tried any of these
products out just yet wants to try them
on camera for the first time but yeah
let me stop rambling going into this
shit I feel like I haven't filmed in so
long so I just wanna do like a lot of
hand motions a lot of one of these one
of these or one of these as always you
guys do like this video because there's
not like me please don't fucking watch
it you know the drill with that but you
guys that do like this video please go
ahead subscribe to my channel if you're
not already and if you know what's up a
many MUA and welcome to my channel but
yeah it's gonna get into today's video
PS my spray tan I got spray tan and it's
like obviously getting fucked up because
I've had it for on for like over a week
now and it's like I'm in scrub I will
get I will deal with that later so I
have four items here that are the items
I'm going to be talking about I got
these items from the hush app so before
I get into I just want to talk about it
really really quickly it isn't half that
you can get like makeup and whatnot that
a cheaper price I don't think anything I
bought was over $10 and honestly I am
here for the discount I'm so here for I
think it's amazing I think that if
you're able to sell makeup at a
discounted rate like if your example if
you have like a really great connection
in China and they make your makeup and
they make your packaging they make
everything and you can't afford to make
a product for ten dollars to sell it for
$10 that is incredible and I would
absolutely do that too if I had that
ability and I had these connections and
China that I don't have them yet I will
for my brand in the future if I had them
I would absolutely utilize it however my
big issue with this is I do think that
they're ripoffs I think that it's really
kind of fucked up that hey Brian is
stealing the concept of a product or a
pout or something and putting it into
their own and making it a lot cheaper I
don't think it's very fair because a
brand works hard at creating this one
specific concept I get it I work hard on
my concept I'm sure I'll get copied in
the future or whatever with things that
I've done but I just want you guys to
know it does really suck for the brand I
think it's unfair for them and even
though I do get the fact that it's like
oh my god was cheaper I don't have a lot
of money to spend on the original and
whatnot I get that dude I get that I've
been there I've been that bitch I have
been that fucking bitch but the end of
the day come up with your original
palette your original ideas and produce
those you don't need to copy a complete
other palette it's just not fair to me
so that's just my opinion on it
personally before I even get into this
video that's what I wanted to say if you
don't agree with me that's totally fine
that is an opinion that's the beauty of
an opinion anyway so let's go and talk
about the first one I have to
highlighting pallets that I wanted to
talk about first and I have two
eyeshadow palettes that when it's not
going on so the first things first is
the I'm Nastasia and Nicole Guerrero
palette this palette mmm this is
literally one of my favorite palettes
non-saucy has ever done like it's
literally just godly and the cool
Guerrero they fucking just killed it
it's so good and the hush
one that I picked up is this one the
Rose a highlighting collection so these
are the two palettes and obviously they
don't look that similar when you're
looking like this is like oh they're
both pink great it's when you open up
the palette that you're like
like you like you almost want to gag so
then you look at this do you think wow
wow wow so when looking at the two
pallets collectively together they are
not in the exact same order which is why
I think they get away with it but they
have the exact same colors in it where
I'm like bitch you can buy this for like
ten dollars I'm gonna go and try them
out I'm really really curious about it
they're not called the same things which
is great I'm like thank you God if they
wear we're gonna go in and apply these
on the face and see which is a better
one
we're gonna swatch a couple so we're
gonna take the rip-off one first and
we're gonna swatch it when to swatch all
day Cheers oh my god that feels fucking
good okay but I'm honestly truly from
the bottom of my heart I'm a little
gagged I'm not I'm not kidding you I did
not expect for it to be as smooth and
creamy and pigmented as they are of
course honest Asus they feel absolutely
amazing I'm gonna swatch the exact same
for it's actually crazy that the anasazi
ones don't even feel as smooth or as
creamy as the other one that's really
fuckin rude but they're just as blinding
and just as stunning actually I think a
little bit more blending so these are
the four from the UH Nastasia kit so
we're gonna match them up if these four
versus these four oh my god
yes oh my goddess both stunning of both
blinding shockingly similar as we can
see of course the hush app1 is obviously
a complete ripoff of the Anasazi one
there's no denying it there's no denying
it you rip the bitch off I mean the
quality I'm truly shocked at how nice it
was
so anyway I'm gonna go and apply one on
one side one on the other side I'm gonna
apply kitty cat that was my favorite one
I'll be honest I said once I'm taking
the anasazi one I'm applying kitty cat
right here on the cheeks and I'm taking
a more feet r31 I just been really
liking this kind of brush for
highlighter recently I've also been
using it to like apply a blank shadow to
my lid after I'm done priming I just
like I don't know bitch this color is
actually everything and then take a
little bit of glow getter
on top now or take the other side of my
going with the same thing we're gonna
take all day which is that quip okay
picked up a lot more it's more pigmented
than the anastasi one but that's not
always a good thing it's definitely not
image means there's a lot more power
that comes up so let's see how it
actually applies and see if it applies
nicely does it not play nicely who
fucking knows fuck that's good bitch I'm
sorry but the bitch is unclocked able
like it just is one take a little bit of
bubbly there's that we did on the other
one playing top also this brush is great
for Denethor on occasion you take down
the side both blinding both stunning
they look honestly on this skin bitch
they looked exactly the same okay so the
Rose a highlighting palette retails $10
and I'm just really shocked at how nice
and as a mirror and it's fucking like
sturdy so fucking it's a heavy bitch
like this is a big fucking whore so far
one-for-one I would say this is actually
a really really really really good dupe
for the Nastasia Nicole Guerrero and
honestly I didn't want to like it I
really didn't because I thought I think
it's not fair that they copied it but
the end of the day this is I mean I'm
youtubers I'm going to do full time I'm
gonna be honest and honestly it works
very well next pal I want to talk about
is another highlighting palette that I
got from the hush app so we have
paradise highlighting kid versus hooter
3d pad I think it in golden sands are
y'all Steven what I've seen are y'all
seeing what I'm seeing
obviously this one's in a circle form
this is in a square form as a mirror
that we're gonna go ahead and swatch a
couple of these guys and see what we can
we take the hush one first we're gonna
see what oh my god it's a fucking it's a
fucking could I meet that is a cream
just like the fucking hooter one it's a
cream okay well that's so fuck that okay
go ahead we're gonna swipe the cream
first cream down we got the cream me
it's a little too pigmented where it's
like goddamn like it like this chunks up
fuck me dude fuck me dude okay here the
four swatched right here so I think okay
now we're gonna swatch the hood i'm
swatching the Fiji Fiji is the cream
this one's actually a different color
which is great
that's a fucking ugly color no shade no
shade it's just ugly let's go and swatch
Seychelles
oh these feel amazing Seychelles Tahiti
we have hush right here we have CUDA
right there I can see they're a little
bit different they're not crazy
different but they're definitely
different enough where it's like oh when
swatching knows as well they spelt
amazing just like the UH Nastasia tube
that they did as well so hmm the website
I don't like ten minute it's another way
in Finnish okay bitch okay I'm also
putting a little bit of oh my god
putting a little bit of the UM rosy X
under stuff to highlighter on my mate
bitch if y'all don't get this I swear to
god you are missing out or not always
thinking they gave me that go away it's
like right at the brink of too much but
then okay guys so now that we are done
with the highlighters we finished off
with the highlighting pellets both of
them were actually worked very well and
I'm shocked that they worked so well I
am shocked because it's like oh we have
two eyeshadow pots I really really
wanted to compare really quickly so
first ones first we have the hardest Pro
palette and we have the Amazonian clay
palette see this is dark right here this
is where we get a little fucked because
obviously tart is known for their
Amazonian clay it's literally called
Amazonian clay palette the tardis pro
palette and this is the on Amazonian
clay palette $29 palette so then you
open up the tar one and you're gonna be
a little gags cuz you look at the tar
one and you're like oh my word spending
this is actually a beautiful palette I
love this one I was on the trip in Bora
Bora when they launched this palette and
it was everything so this is the dupe 2
palette and this is the Tarte one bitch
are you fucking kidding me you're that
girl I knew you were so it's going to
swatch a couple of the Tarte real shades
I'm gonna swatch the exact same colors
from the fake one we're gonna take it
trendy which is a beautiful fuckin shade
oh my word
so here we have four eyeshadows from the
Tarte palette this is them right here
they're honestly they're so beautiful I
absolutely
loved this Tarte palette so much when it
came out I was losing it all the time so
let's go ahead and swatch oh my god oh
this is even this isn't even worse the
shades on here
ethereal glam minx trendy ethereal glam
minx trendy even that's when you know
we're starting to get a little Christ
thing we're not wearing let's watch them
let's see so now we're gonna go in and
show the comparison swatches right here
so this is the other side this is the
duped side this is the original site
actually I hope you guys can see what
the original is so much more rich in
color and pigment this side is literally
just like that like ugly stepsister of
the other one and this one I would
actually say is there's really really
shitty Dube it's not like the other two
highlighting palettes where is actually
good dupe where I was like oh bitch like
I'm like show this one is like pretty
bad actually this one is not very very
good this one actually feels very cheap
it alone feels like nothing like there's
learning nothing in here you're gonna
fucking frisbee the bitch out to like
space the shadows are not nearly as
pretty they don't feel nearly as good
they don't give as much color payoff as
the Tarte one I'm glad to say that with
this one this comparison the Tarte one
bitch the Tarte one slays cool we got
one that's so cool there's another gag
we have the UH Nastasia subculture
palette which as we know was kind of a
mess it's actually Lauren shielding
borrow it as we can see this is a mess
this is the original subculture not one
of the newer ones this is an original
subculture I'm talking oh gee powdery as
fuck like goddamn but then we have the
retro love obviously it's arranged
differently we know this it's arranged
differently really one swatch a couple
of these as well and we're just gonna
sing we're gonna swatch : we're gonna
put on right hand and see how it
compares with V it's like shocking me so
I forget every time I swatch it I'm like
oh my god okay so now let's go and
swatch the other ones what's the flower
oh okay I'm digging into the retro love
one and feeling it you guys holy shit it
feels like butter more buttery than
modest awesome I'm nuts for short it
literally feels like a cream
like I don't even know if I can explain
are you joking me right now like are you
actually joking me no we got the
swatches on you guys so we have original
we have uh Nastasia right there this is
the Anasazi one right here four shades
are here five shades are here and we
have the doomed one right here which is
actually scarily accurate with the dupe
actually the dupe one this side the
shimmers are better than these two
phenomena see one what the fuck I'm a
little shocked Kirra you guys I went in
and I zoomed in for this part random
sign oh I completely forgot to mention
this basically all of these three that I
pulled earlier are from the brand bad
habit they are not from hush technically
hush is like a online retailer
I like completely forgot to mention this
I kept singing it like basically
thinking of it as like hush was the one
else producing this that's not the case
bad habit is the brand that's actually
creating these dupes bad habit but
haven't hush
actually just carries them they sell a
ton of different brands on their app the
tart dupe is from the brand o : that was
a flop don't fuck with that one anyway
you guys so I just wanna talk about this
really quickly the retro Left palette
the a subculture dupe is also from the
brand bad habit the bad habit ones
honestly quality is very very very very
good the packaging is very good so it's
very like so anyway I'm just gonna do a
quick I I want to do a comparison
between both sides like I want to do
like a boom of the right of subculture
and a boom of the left of the subculture
just kind of things like that to see how
different they actually end up looking
so we're gonna go right on in we're
gonna take the shader Roxy from the UH
Nastasia palette and that's gonna go I'm
gonna do it on the right I would follow
you guys it's fucking real I'm sorry
it's really real we're gonna just take
that I'm gonna do like a really fun just
peachy
easy kind of thing you know it's quick
easy it's so wildly pigmented this shade
so we did Roxy and put that in the
crease this is what it looks like it's
very pigmented I literally did one dip
now we're gonna take flower power also
oh my god Oh miss mama absolutely not
just as fallout II as the UH Nastasia
one holy shit they said let's we really
really really want to come from an
associate let's be just as powdering in
just a small huh
you were not playing with this do for
you so far I'm not having any problems
like it's literally like I almost look a
little bit darker like it's blending
like as you can see this one is not
pigmented as the Anasazi one it's more
like a a like wash of color rather than
like an actual intensely pigmented treat
like that one okay I'm gonna go back in
the shade and really try to over
saturate the brush and really trying to
get a color down okay guys so as we're
going in with the shade so this one
actually the one from the retro love I
actually like it more because it blends
a little bit easier as you see like when
you're putting it down it's harsh line
when you put it down it doesn't blend
out as easily but the one from bad habit
actually did now let's go in with a
deeper color okay we're gonna take the
shade rock and roll from the retro left
palette we're gonna put that down but
honest okay this is not working out for
me this is a hard note for me right now
I don't like how this looks
it's like doesn't it doesn't blend as
easily it's too much honestly there's a
such thing as too much pigment there is
definitely such a thing so far that
bitch is going out oh my god let's take
all-star from the Anastacio palette
all-stars more pigmented than fuck
another one and that one was already
able to his funk again this is another
too pigmented moment right now you guys
as you guys can see as I'm doing the
makeup you can see what the honest
Stassi want is so much more rich in
color which is great because it's like
bitch that's right the fucking original
has more color now just going with one
final look we're just you like a
shimmery one we'll take the one from the
retro love and put a little in that's
really pretty it's actually funny
because the shimmers of this palette are
so much nicer okay so let's go and take
adorn on the right side
there's no while like much of a blatant
copy this is it like is weird that's all
we need to do we don't need to do any
more okay we've gotten our fucking
verdict on that one okay bad habit sign
right there
not nearly as pigmented and we have the
UH Nastasia side which is so fucking
crazy pigmented from the mattes at least
I will admit though honestly the retro
love the mattes yes
they aren't nearly as pigmented as the
UH Nastasia ones are but they do blend
quite nicely I have to admit like they
blend it out pretty well not like
amazing we're like oh my god this is a
shot I've ever used but it definitely
buns out well enough where you're like
oh so I will say honestly that the retro
love is another dupe for the necessities
of culture it's not gonna be nearly as
pigmented it's not gonna be as intense
but it's 10 bucks Donna saucy ones 42
you really just can't really mean it and
yet you guys that's it for today's video
I tested out these products here that I
was very fuckin curious about and I will
admit the stuff from bad habit shook me
to the core I'm shocked at how nice
their quality was and how cheap and
affordable it was again this is a
personal thing I do think that it's kind
of fucked for them to even do this in
the first place and copy other brands as
work yes I get that it's cheaper I
fucking get it
but it's still you can be original and
be cheaper today if you guys do want any
of these products like the highlighters
and things like that I mean you will get
nice quality you really fucking will and
it's shocking
but it really really did work out and
honestly hush they delivered my stuff
when I ordered it they delivered it he
was in like three days it was a really
really quick shipping and it was just it
was all wrapped in bubble wrap it was
actually really really well done so
congrats to the hush app they are really
really great and they do sell a lot of
reputable brand stuff as well on there
if you guys are interested checking them
out this is not sponsored by hush in any
way but I just wanted to say that to you
guys yeah anyways that's it for today's
video please have fun watching as always
have a great sudden night or day
wherever you guys are and I will catch
you guys in my next video bye guys
I love you look how fucked up my spray
tan is you guys see how fucked up my
spray tan is right now like are you
seeing this I don't know that's a too by
the way
so I have this tattoo here I want one
right here
should I got it love meat on this body
there's a lot of fucking me are you
kidding I just started it I keep doing
this other way that's the beauty of an
opinion everyone has one they're like
assholes
everyone's got one so not always that
pretty so when you look at this palette
they're not in the exact same order
which is the why I feel like they can't
avoid
I just want to dive in the water take
what it would take it as you want
are you fucking gay who said let me not
only do Boop let's make it a little bit
better I'm quite curious about this oh
we're just gonna dip on and we're gonna
dive on and we're gonna jump on in we're
gonna hop on in we're gonna hop scotch
me and you guys that's it that's it for
today's video that's all I have to do
