channels aren't already and if you're
new what is up my name is Mandy MUA and
I'm a beauty bitch okay enough come down
yeah it's gonna get into this October
favorites video okay first things first
okay first things first I like to go in
with more skincare items first in the
beginning of the video to kind of like
do it all it down to makeup so the first
thing I wanna talk about is the benefit
dream screen broad-spectrum 45 SPF so
basically this is a sub screen this is
the best sunscreen I've ever tried ever
for the face it is so freakishly nice
the reason I like it this is the reason
I like it when it goes into the skin it
kind of feels like a sunscreen it feels
kind of like it has like that white
consistency it feels kind of like
sunscreen is just kind of heavy ish
filling but as soon as it dries it dries
to a powder finish not only just drunk
to a powder finish but it makes your
skin feeling like silicone for example
if you put a primer on your skin like a
silicone based primer and it you get you
have like that slippery like soft / like
powdery finish on your face that is what
this gives you this is why I love it so
much I'm very impressed with the
sunscreen it's 45 SPF broad-spectrum
that means it is UVA and UVB protected
or like approved or whatever it's called
literally set invisible silky matte
finish like it is a silky matte finish
that's exactly what it is if you guys
like sub screen but you don't like the
feeling of something you don't like the
smell of intense sunscreen you will love
this try it out I mean it's not a seed
bomb I use this on days I don't want any
makeup because I want like obviously
need sunscreen protection sunscreen is
so important for your skin so check out
the benefit dream screen love's next one
is a super heating from random ass item
I don't want to put the first guys I
want you guys to think that I was like
 sponsored by it
I wa I'm not I wish I was though
damn I wish I was watched by this
so this is the poo pourri is so random
I'm sorry so random like as you can see
there's not a lot left in here I shoulda
left so basically what this is it is a
poop spray it's a poop spray basic
you spray it in the toilet before you
take a and it makes your like
not smell in the toilet right like in
the bathroom
I'm not sure I'm not you guys
oh okay I'm not kidding you guys like
this works like it freakin works my
mom ended up buying this and she gave to
me she's like here like you won like for
your bathroom or whatever cuz have like
the downstairs bathroom and she's like
here I know your stayin so here's
the blueberry and I'm like so I think
how it works it like it creates like a
film on the on the water and so when
like you're like goes through like
the water it was like that it like seals
the water seals and then like the smell
can't get out like that visual this is
like my second bottle of it because I've
had it for a couple of months I'm just
kept forgetting to talk about it I take
you whenever I'm traveling I take it's
like Nikki's house or the Patrick's
house when I'm in LA I take it like all
the time they they appreciate it because
much it don'ts like honestly like I have
a huge fear of people knowing that I'm
taking a it's not the fear of
people knowing that I'm because
I mean you're in the bathroom for like
ten minutes people are gonna die you're
 whatever I have a fear of
people like if they can smell it or they
know it's happening like like I cannot
let them like listen I have to turn like
the shower on I don't want no anyone
hearing anything going on and same with
smelling it like so this really helps
prevent me and gives me less anxiety of
 at my friend's house yes they
know you shat but it doesn't smell bad
so I'm not like its self-conscious about
it does that make sense so I don't know
I think it's awesome I don't know where
you can find it to be honest I think my
mom got it I like I don't know I think
you got on Amazon I'll find it and I'll
link it down below but honestly if you
guys can try the Capri it's
works and I am so happy with that guy
I'm so happy with this but Bri if you
ever fought have you ever seen this
sponsor bitch because I love your I
wish I was watching let me get the
 witch it's like making money
from like things that you love like go
try that out who would turn that down
the next two items are from urban decay
and me and Patrick had the privilege of
visiting the urban decay headquarters
when I was in LA and it is seriously one
of the most sickening Pass offices ever
it's like all purple it's like
everyone's super super cool and like
chic and very like urban and I'm like oh
so oh my god urban they're all urban
urban decay see what you guys said that
I see what you guys did there I see you
everyone at the team of urban is amazing
I love them and so like they give us a
huge goodie bag and I've been checking
out a couple things two things I did get
try out and
I'm obsessed with is perversion eyeliner
Mama's done this eyeliner is seriously
one of the best eyeliners I've ever
tried I think it is creamy it is so so
black stays in the waterline I just
think it's absolutely amazing I think
it's such a great liner when I worked at
Sephora I wouldn't go to perversion all
time and I use perversion all the time
but I completely forgot about it because
you like when you stop working Sephora
you just forget like the products you
use all the time so when I saw this with
our naked headquarters I was like I left
perversion like can I have it I love it
if you guys have ever tried it you guys
know it is so black it is so creamy it
is like a Kohl pencil that is super nice
and you like blend it out really nicely
I use it in the Sarah Sanderson tutorial
it works so nice you guys saw it like
going on and you guys are probably like
damn that blends really nice it
really does and this is also so good and
I would highly recommend perversion
urban decay pencil next I'm Ricky I
didn't the last one this is just
honestly like I haven't used this this
month but I wanted to talk about it
because I used to be obsessed with a
dupe of it a couple months ago when Mac
created this collection I don't know
what it was called
they created this shadow called
boom-boom room I was floored by how
amazing that shadow was it is like this
is really cool intense like turquoise
pink reflecting like glittery shade but
Urban Decay has a Duke called solstice
which is actually what I'm going to be
showing today this is what it looks like
it is gorgeous it is the same exact
thing as the gloom of room basically
it's identical honestly let me just do
you see this honestly I don't know
if you guys can see the I don't
know if you guys were ever interested in
Mack the boom-boom room but you guys
couldn't get it I know I I swear I had
so many people tweeting me about
boom-boom room like trying to find it
and they couldn't get to it so it's not
really really bad after talking about it
you guys cannot get that I'm sorry
cuz I know it wasn't in addition but
Urban Decay Solstice is the complete do
for it it is to die for
amazing check out solstice if you guys
can sickening sickening what is this
isn't call I mean the K solstice
eyeshadow loves it
okay let's go and talk about highlighter
now I really wanted to talk about this
because I am living and breathing in it
this entire month so it is the extra
dimension skinfinish in oh darling this
is what it looks like it is a really
sickening gold highlighter Mac's
extra dimension skin finishes dude
they are sickening this reminds me so
much of the whisper of guilts by Mac
that's a really really really popular
extra dimension skin finished because it
is a really intensely reflecting gold
shade this is also an intensely
reflecting gold shade very similar to
whisper of guilt almost identical like
seriously almost identical I'm wearing
it on my cheekbones today I've been
wearing it all month long I think it's
so amazing sometimes at my moments where
I'm like Mac is like annoying this
 I mean you know but sometimes they
have moments like this where they
destroyed my life and I want to be like
this look as I said very intensive gold
I love a bright highlighters I am a
beige or brown highlighters I love him I
thought you loved them
I saw Omron using this on her snapchat
and I was like I need it right now so I
went and I try to push it online it was
 sold out so I like snapped about
it I was like and so people were
tweeting me that I was like coming out
in store the next day
the manager at the Mac are you still
working texted me she's like hey we have
like that and I was like I need you to
hold me what I need you hold more for me
I need you to so I wind got it and I
found out that later on Nicole Jung
Hwa's in Polish Nicole ended up buying
an extra one of these ancestry send it
to me and I totally say how grateful I
am Nicole if you're watching this like
that you would do that like that's such
a sweet gesture not many friends would
do that and I just want to say thank you
so much for sending me oh darling and I
really appreciate it so if you guys can
get your hands on oh darling by Mac it
is sickening only two more items there's
not a lot of there's no light amiss
month guys I'm sorry because when I talk
about this brush really quickly I'm not
gonna go into too much detail about it
but I just wanna talk about it real
quick this is the morphe m42 2 it is a
flat paddle brush this is what I was
using to contour movies with like if you
guys follow me on snapchat on Twitter
and whatever and on Instagram you guys
know like I it was contouring boobies
for Halloween because I want it to be
like a chicken character so I'd be like
contouring boobs this is the brush I use
if you guys are ever interested in doing
contouring of boobs or like any kind of
shadow packing or brow bone highlight
this is such an awesome brush do I
always end up bringing up one brush at
least for in a favorites video and this
was only like four bucks I think it's
like super super super inexpensive and
it works really nicely so if you guys
are ever interested in getting a nice
packing brush that's really really
fluffy but still it packs really nicely
on to the face or wherever on the
chichis wherever
try out the m42 - I have a morphe
