today's video is going to be another
fall tutorial I'm so into fall and
autumn mode right now like I just want
to do everything that's fall inspired so
I wanted to do another fall look but
today I wanted to be a little bit
different and do some color I haven't
done anything like colorful colorful
wise in a while so I thought why not
incorporate a green olive like smokey
eye it's still incorporating color but
it's still so fall appropriate and so
beautiful and I think that this look
turned out really really nicely forgive
like if you see any kind of like
cracking in my face my eyes and my nose
got really really really really running
throughout this video because I don't
know my allergies I'm starting to act up
really badly and so I just couldn't stop
anything like all my offices were just
leaking why is it sound so gross
if I look like kind of like a disaster
right now I apologize I try to get
through the tutorial as quick as I
possibly could so that I wouldn't like
be a gross mess yeah other than that you
guys know the drill if you guys are like
this kind of video if you guys don't
like me don't watch it let's
thank that ass but if you guys do like
this video and you guys do like me
please like this video and subscribe to
my channel if you want already and
comment what you guys want to see you
next but yeah let's go ahead and get
into this full face tutorial okay so
we're gonna go and start this tutorial I
actually have no makeup on whatsoever I
don't have moisturizer on I want to do a
full face kind of thing I didn't want to
just kind of be like basic and just do
that eyes even though the eyes are the
main point of this video I want to do
kind of like a get ready with me style
so yeah we're just gonna go ahead and
start doing the whole entire face let's
start this bitch let's get started we're
gonna take the mineral primer veil by
hourglass I haven't actually used it on
camera before but I used it a couple
times actually like this primer I've
used this one a couple times and it's
really nice Rizzoli's skin feels really
really nice it's expensive as hell
though oh my god it's so expensive it
doesn't give me like that silicone
feeling and it doesn't like fill in my
pores like I wish that they were fills
in but momma has big pores so I like to
cover that but that does not happen
with these primer for foundation I'm
gonna take the Loreal Pro matte
infallible which is how my forgiving
baby I'm going to shade 103 natural buff
I'm like running out of this thing
severely and I'm just kind of put that
on the t-zone with a Beauty Blender a
damp Beauty Blender some percent to the
t-zone this foundation is just so good
and from the drugstore it so cheap it's
so good I put it mainly in the t-zone uh
because that's where I get the most oily
and this is more of a mattifying oil
controlling foundation t-zone covered in
this
nation and everything else is left bare
for the rest of my face I'm gonna be
going in with the mega favorite Ultra HD
stick I use this in my makeup forever
tutorial and I'm feeling kind of cover
up the rest of my face mostly on the
cheeks with the stick this is like a
full coverage foundation that gives you
more of a natural finish I'm just gonna
put that on the perimeters of my face
the reason I'm avoiding the t-zone is
because this does not help prevent my
oil whatsoever I get still oily as hell
want to use this mix and match people
mix and match for whatever you need
ears too perfect now my base is based up
so next I can see we're gonna conceal
these bags these bags are bad
they're not Chanel okay so I'm gonna
take the Maybelline master class in the
shade light I'm gonna take that
underneath my eyes listen go right from
the tube I love this concealer I'm also
going to highlight with it as well it's
just so good it's like full coverage
super brightening but you need to set it
extremely fast like you can't like wait
to set it because it will kind of get
greasy and then I'm gonna mix that with
the Mac prep and prime in light boost
just to give me some more brightness
underneath the eye you know my ass likes
to be highlighted to death and the
beauty butter it out again and then
taking my trusty bare minerals
well-rested
powder on a morphe m4 3/8 I'm gonna just
run that over my eye just to kind of set
everything I'm so well rested that is a
huge difference connection look at this
brightness and happiness and awakeness
and then look at that bug initiative
it's low sleepy so now for the highlight
I'm gonna go in with just like a cream
highlight before I go in with powder
ones later
I haven't powdered my face or anything
like that yet but I'm gonna take these
you a champagne highlighter I just got
this recently and I haven't tried it yet
so almost gonna try it I'm gonna use my
ring finger and just kind of press that
over usually wear highlights go it's a
very pretty
glowy rosy champagne tone it's very
natural though this like by itself is
very natural I think it just gives you
more like a glow from within actually
really quite stunning Wow very beautiful
I'm impressed
make one powder my face just because I
wanted to get that face done and beaten
to death and it's pretty beat I'm going
to take the Mac mineralize skinfinish in
medium with my morphe g-zero you guys
know the drill with this this was my
favorite brush my favorite powder brush
of life I love the Mac mineralize
skinfinish powder it literally gives you
like a skin finish I think it's
absolutely beautiful and it gives you
the most natural-looking powder finish
even if you're drew
like I think people even people that are
dry would love the mac mineralize
skinfinish kind of expensive it's like
32 bucks for a powder I was like why
hopefully you have a friend that works
at Mac and can get you that discount
bitch good good no how about that game
are you guys really excited for
Halloween time I love Halloween time but
I suck at doing Halloween makeup so I
never really do like own you know
I'm super excited I'm super stoked for
Halloween I can not wait em to me so fat
Hawk tober it's such a full ass month
like I'm so nervous for October because
it's gonna be so crazy I think I'm gonna
be going to generation Beauty I'm not
really sure yet but I think I am there's
Halloween obviously it just it's gonna
be a crazy-ass month I can already tell
like October is gonna be a
madhouse but I'm excited what do you
guys most excited for with whatever we
hit fault I'm like wait what do you guys
like to do like Halloween do you guys
like followed you guys like Thanksgiving
like what's your kind of like thinks I
love fall type I feel like once we get
into fall and autumn it everything's
festive and like happy I don't know man
let go here now that we are powdered
let's one brought up the face I'm gonna
take hula of course on my morphe to
another of course tan beige I'm a
 creature of habit when I find
products that I love like I love them
and I cannot stop using them like it's
just how I've always been so I'm going
to go ahead and bronze with the face
using hoola
I love hoola bronzer so much lugging
good I think I want to do like a
snapchat Q&amp;amp;A I think a lot of people
have been doing like snapchat Q&amp;amp;A s and
like they've been going around for like
a while now and people are doing them
but I don't know if people would want to
see that you guys want to see a snapchat
Q&amp;amp;A I just did a Q&amp;amp;A like couple weeks
ago that's the problem so maybe I can do
one like in a couple of months or like
in a couple weeks when I my other Q&amp;amp;A is
not so fresh I don't know what you guys
think okay so this is the thing a lot of
people always ask me like Manny why can
I send you any snaps the reason you
became sent me snaps is cuz I have it
such a private to like people only
friends with can send me snaps and the
reason is because I get a lot of snap
views okay so when you get a lot of snap
views and you have your snap set public
your snapchat will usually freeze
because you're getting a lot of
snapchats you know so that's kind of the
reason why I haven't been able to really
put it on public because my snapchat
will freeze I can't snapchat
snap training so like figure their
out you feel me there's nice and
bronzing bronzy and bronze how this
videos not too long I just look I'm
talking I'm very talkative today I just
want to like talk to you guys more so
forgive me that's too long forgive me
I'm gonna go with some blush I'm gonna
take my morphe III brush and video blush
by Urban Decay I've never tried any
blushes I just got some of them recently
and I really wanted to try it out oh
that's pretty good so nice like it's
like a flesh color take a rose pink rose
pink there we go I'm like what the
color are you okay so now I'm gonna go
with the shade and light palette by Kat
Von D I'm gonna take my favorite like
contouring brush now of all time then
makeup geek chisel cheek brush basically
this brush I'm gonna take this shade
this brush has really revamped my
contouring who is calling me the reason
why I love this brush the bristles are
extremely soft and the length of them is
perfect it's a it is the perfect brush
basically okay so you guys know like
about the eater brush the NARS eda it's
a really extremely popular brush that is
used for like bronzing and contouring
right I have the eita brush and I really
don't like it I've talked about it on my
channel before like that I don't like
the NARS eita Ganzi when I first tried
it I was expecting something like
life-changing I thought was gonna be
amazing it was like oh my god I cannot
wait to try this out hated it like I
literally hate it and I was like what
the why do I hate this brush you
know finally realized that the bristles
were just not the kind of bristle I like
I don't like tough bristles like that it
was a really tough brush for me to use
so when I receive this brush this is
exactly everything that I wanted from
the EDA like that's why I like this so
much I feel like this brush has like
really revamped my contouring gaming
because it's just so ridiculously soft
it's so good honestly I don't even know
what to say about it like without
 sounding like a cheeseball but
it's seriously amazing base is almost
done now I'm gonna highlight for reals
like on top of my highlighter I'm so
excited to finally be able to use this
on camera because they're actually out
now I felt so bad using them before this
is the honest Asya so Hollywood
highlighter I've been using these
highlighters for the past couple of
months and I am obsessed I'm gonna take
my morphe M 510 brush and just dip right
into it and just start highlighting with
it I'm obsessed whoa maybe I want a
little bit much oh my god I was like why
is this looking so crazy right now I
just realize I have a cream highlighter
underneath its title and a little bit of
that out perfect so we have the base of
the face completely blooming yes you do
a little bit nose contouring I've been
really into nose contouring lately I
don't know why it's just been like
something I've been wanting to do but
I've been using this little makeup deep
brush I've been using this low shade
over here dusting off a very little bit
to use a very small amount of it and
just been kind of contouring my nose
with this brush just very very very
lightly like nothing too crazy because I
don't like to do a heavy nose contour I
feel like it can make me look real like
a up real quick
but this brush is pretty freakin perfect
for a nose contour cuz it's so thin but
like the bristles are so nice like
just so good boom well that snatch nose
see it like that was really like 30
seconds cool so now that we're done with
the face we're gonna go and do the eyes
now and let's go ahead and get ready for
that eye so I jumped into the eyeballs
so we can focus on the eyes so we can
finish the ice I don't know I don't know
why I suddenly go into accent sometimes
I just do I'm really weird I love
accents for some reason I just release
to already filled in my brows off of
camera and I already put on my primer I
use a Smashbox 24-hour as always it's
the best one that I've ever used for
oily lids if you have greasy lids it's
the best primer I'm not kidding start
going to some shades now this is my
palette I'm gonna work with I want to do
like something like different something
more colorful than usual so wish me luck
because I feel like I do neutrals very
well but I don't do color super super
well all the time
firstly ones I don't ever work with like
green I'm gonna take a mixture of
beaches and cream and this beautiful
warm orange shade that shall not be
named and I'm gonna put that in the
crease with a morphe 27 brush
now just go into the crease it's just
such a gorgeous like warm transition I
want it to be really warm in the crease
I think that's really great when you're
doing like colorful things on the lid
like I love to do a nice warm transition
shade just kind of tie everything
together that makes sense
like that seems it's nice beautiful like
warm warm crease so now I'm gonna go in
with dirty martini by makeup geek and
I'm going to go in with out on a morphe
and 4-3-3 and it's just a really nice
olive green shade it's very very pretty
I'm gonna be putting that on the outer
corner and into the crease lower then we
have that nice warm transition shade
now I'm taking that all the way into the
front of the eye just nice light motions
flipping the brush upwards to blitt into
the warm crease perfect so now I'm going
to go in with a black base I'm gonna be
using the morphe gel liner in Slate it
is a really nice just black eyeliner but
I'm gonna use it as my base today I want
to go to more of a smokey look I've
decided so I'm gonna take a little bit
on a morphine 32 packing brush I'm just
gonna run that on the lid closest to the
lash line it's so black and so creamy
it's the oh it's so good all the way up
to that dirty martini color as soon as
I'm getting higher and higher I'm using
lighter pressure and blending downwards
so I could have a nice little blend
so we have a nice black base down looks
looked alive I'm gonna grab a mixture of
high tea and dirty martini on this just
Sigma e30 2 brushes look at nice just
packing brush I'm gonna pack that on the
entire lid to give me a nice green olive
green base I'm using the black base down
first cuz I like the way that a black
base gives you dimension for this kind
of color it just it makes it look so
beautiful and I'm taking that right up
to the dirty martini color just
concentrate on packing on the color you
should add something like this it's nice
green olive shade and bean we're gonna
take that import 2 3 again and then mix
dirty martini and high tea on the brush
and just go into that crease and just
blend away in to the warm orange shade
that we have going on I was like so
nervous to do this too I'm like
olive green smokey eye what the hell do
I think I am and then I'll go back in
with that nice warm shade with beaches
and cream mix just kind of go over the
edges still slightly I still want it to
be really warm and I want to make sure I
don't lose any of that warmth in the
crease because I don't like it to be too
cool tone or too green I guess you could
say I want to have some nice depth and
dimension and you should have something
like this so far
yeah perfect we have both of the tops of
the eyes done it's nice and blended I
think it looks really really nice and I
feel like it looks very festive it's
very different for me I don't really
ever do like green or blue or things
like that but I really want to start
venturing out into the world and I think
it looks really beautiful especially
with that like nice orange a warm
transition in like a nice dark lid I
love it I love it I love it I love it
we're gonna be taking the Tarte inner
rim liner it just like a black eye liner
and I'm just gonna line the waterline
this I swear this is like one of the
creamiest liners I've ever frickin tried
it is so creamy and then tight line as
well so I'm just going to take a little
bit of the black along the lash line
make sure you coat your lashes too with
the eyeliner if you want any like little
like missing like skin spots you know I
know it looks really janky as hell but
that's okay because we're gonna fix it
so now I'm taking a morphe M 508 I use a
special all the time and we're going to
smudge out the Tarte liner is very very
creamy so it blends up really easily and
now of course we need to be going over
it with green again I'm gonna take a
mixture again of dirty martini and high
tea I'm using more 40:36 and just blend
that over the black I want to be exactly
the same as it is on the top and this
will take a little bit of time just to
cover
all the black and then take that nice
orange e shade again and then go ahead
and blend out that dirty martini just
some nice warmth to give it more
dimension not make it look so harsh and
stark you know to me okay so basically I
had to like turn off the camera because
my eyes were going crazy like I might
ology start acting I'm really bad my
nose started running really bad my eye
started watering so right now I have a
spot in my eye that I will not take
liner so I'm just gonna skip past it I
mean I've been waiting like ten minutes
to like let it like subside so I can put
eyeliner there but it just will not take
whatsoever it's too watery so I'm just
gonna have to deal with it for
now it just happens I went ahead
and I applied mascara off Karen just cuz
I didn't know like what the to
expect this eye so I did that off-camera
so I'm going to apply some lashes
because his eyes is much more smokey and
intense I'm going to be using my Bello
lashes from nuba and pump these lashes
kill me
they just make everything so much better
than what it was originally basically I
told I had to do this last step but I'm
gonna take shimma shimma as my highlight
on a morphe M 3 to 6 I'm gonna put on
inner corner of my eyes just really
brighten it up i whatever bring a really
intense smoky eye i want to go really
heavy with the highlight on the inner
corner and the eyes just cuz I feel like
it really it really brings it look
together a little bit on the brow bone
as well just a smidgen and now the eyes
are officially complete I'm going to be
guys in to see what they look like
okay cool so now that the eyes are dead
I'm gonna go ahead and do the lips I'm
gonna take Urban Decay glide on pencil
and stark-naked which is just a nice
nude lip liner I love the urban icky lip
liner so I'm gonna use that to lip line
call these glide on so good and then if
they'll have to live in with it and then
I'm gonna take dose of colors like a
lipstick in sand this is from their Tara
collection I think they're permanent now
I'm not really sure but I want to go to
a more of a cool tone lip so I'm gonna
take this bad boy and put it on my lips
it's very nude since I look is so
dramatic I wanted to go really nude on
the lip dang this is almost concealer
and that is the final look this is
everything and yeah that's it that's it
for the entire look I hope you guys
