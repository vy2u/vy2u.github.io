so I tried to do it and so many times
many times so basically this video is
going to be another one of my
installments of my one brand makeup
tutorials the one that I did on NYX
Cosmetics I'm guessing no idea what I'm
talking about I'll leave a link down
below I'm starting a new series on my
channel where I'm doing one brand
tutorials and this is my second
installment of it using all Benefit
Cosmetics which I am so excited to be
using I still work at Sephora for a year
and I would go to benefit for things all
these happen I used to go to benefit for
everything and I love benefit products
this is gonna be a lot easier to do
because it's like I used to use benefit
all the time I never really use NYX like
in another tutorial you guys saw like I
was like not liking some if I
didn't like it you know but this
tutorial I've used benefit products I
love benefit products I knew thousand
like it already so I'm just like hmm
treading in some good water stain on
flame yeah so this is gonna be much more
on the natural side much more glowy much
more youthful much more just like pretty
everyday kind of makeup I've been
getting tons of requests to do more of a
natural makeup look it's much more
natural than what I do so you guys want
to see how I achieve this more natural
glowy pretty everyday look stay on
watching if you guys don't like it I'm
screaming at you clearly other than that
I'll get back to the tutorial I'll see
you later bye everyone
okay cool sores didn't go and start with
our face completely clean and washed I
just go to the shower right now I went
ahead and trimmed my beard and shaved
because I'm going for more that natural
look um if you're a girl which 92% of
you are you don't eat your Savior but if
you're not if you're a boy like me you
only shave it either double life first
benefit and we're gonna go in with is
the Porefessional primer you guys have
seen this on my channel already I love
this primer for me specifically because
I have more oily combination skin and
this primer is amazing for people that
are more oily combination and have
really porous pores which I do I'm just
concentrating them most of the product
in the center of the face and blending
outward with my fingers I don't need too
much of this product I just needed
towards the center because I get oily in
the t-zone and have Gnarls Barkley pores
in the t-zone this is not the time mom's
is not the time I love this primary
personally if you're more on the dry
side I don't know if you're gonna like
it that much because I mean it's met
with people that are more oily and have
really problematic pores so if you are
dry and you have nice skin and don't
have big pores it's not the primer for
you listing so I'm going to go ahead and
go in with the hello flawless foundation
since we're going for more of a natural
look I'm just going to pump a pump of it
on the back of my head actually just
make that two pumps okay I'll make that
one make that one that's too much this
color I'm using as pedal so let's hope
that's my color it's like the second to
lightest so just going in with the
Beauty Blender and dabbing it on I'm
going to go and start at the center of
the face and blend outwards that will
give us the most natural finish I feel
you're just going to concentrate more of
the product in the tea zone where you
mostly need coverage and then you
shouldn't kind of blend up the rest of
the product outwards I I love this
foundation I like this foundation
because it's lightweight but it gives
you a nice amount of coverage you know
it's like a nice medium to full coverage
I think might be due blenders too wet oh
my god it's like taking off the product
that I'm putting down because it's so
wet bitch apply a little bit down the
neck as well perfect now via our
foundation down so I'm gonna go in with
the number one erase paste by benefit I
I love the erase paste get the thing
with erase paste is that you need a very
tiny amount of it like you need like
nothing trust me like a little bit goes
a long way with this product out uses on
clients all the time at Sephora and they
would absolutely love but a unit you
have to teach them how to use it this is
one of sweat because it's so big and
creamy you really need to blend it out
and set it with the powder or it's gonna
be too heavy I'm using the Beauty
Blender just kind of blend it out just
to kind of mask my my blue circles you
know that has like a nice salmon
undertone to it
so it really helps cancel out the blue
hues and I'm not going for a really
dramatic highlighted look I'm just
really covering up the dark circles I'm
just putting in the inner corner I'm
really just pressing it in with a Beauty
Blender I think works so freaking good
at cancelling out like any like darkness
I absolutely love this stuff but again
you have to use it very sparingly if you
just use a little bit of it blend it out
if you want more add a little more okay
trust me trust the bitch cuz I know
perfect we're looking a little more
fresh now I'm going to get the hello
flawless foundation powder in never
settle pedal
never settle pedal oh I like that loop
I might seem like you don't like a man
like don't settle so I'm actually grab a
more feet and 500 which is like a really
huge just very flimsy brush press that
in to this t-zone area because I don't
want a lot of powder I want this lip to
be more in the natural side as we talked
about earlier also set the under-eye
area
this brush is great because it's so like
just fluffy and you don't pick up too
much product you don't deposit too much
product so we're going to use the what's
up basically it's a cream champagne gold
highlight and we're just gonna toss that
on to the high plains of the cheekbones
oh oh bitch I love that and then we're
just gonna kind of buff it in with a
morphe g8 we're just gonna kind of press
it on very lightly to give us a nice
natural glow oh my god I love this the
gives you this really pretty golden
champagne glow to the skin I talked
about this all I literally was over my
faith oh my god so pretty it's all
ringing let's go ahead and just hoola
into our contour areas we're gonna use
that same morphe 500 brush and loosen
missing this precious I don't pick up
too much product and I don't want to
deposit too much I mean I'm not gonna go
for a contoured look this is much more
like just kind of bronzy glow a natural
I know subtle dusting in the temples
this is pretty natural right like this
is natural for me like bitch this isn't
natural has it gone gay I'm just
kind of seeing the rest of the powder
down my neck because I want to match my
neck more I don't I don't really like
the smell out of the powder I feel like
it smells like black licorice
maybe I'm tripping it smells like
licorice a lot of people love that
licorice that black licorice smell I'm
not one of those people it's all it's
all so I'm going to got a little bit of
blush we're gonna grab the rocket or
blush which i think is stunning same
brush does it pick up too much product
doesn't deposit too much product and I
think that if you're more on the natural
side there's like this really cool we're
gonna bet some blush on very lightly yes
bitch like that when I worked to support
my mom got this blush and she's like
almost completely done with it so funny
this blush I think is really great for
more of a just natural everyday pretty
glowy look you know
yes glow coming through glow
gaghe we're go to the brows now we're
gonna go ahead and grab the benefit
gimme brow which is in the color medium
deep which I love this little bad boy
it's like the look unit in the movie or
some kind of pushed out through our
brows they're going to more of a natural
look I think this is a perfect little
product because you just want to do just
do a little bit to the brow but nothing
too quickly just cleans up everything
anything look so cute I love this brow
gel this is like my color too but that's
pretty good for just a little tiny bit
about Jo that's this link just like I'm
just hacia stuff like this is good now
we're gonna kind of clean up the brow
with the gimme brow high brow pencil
we're just gonna really just put that in
the arch of my brow like that I'm just
kind of clean up make everything a
little bit more highlight in it
basically like a cream highlight pencil
I'm just use my finger I'm too lazy to
do anything else but use my finger to
blend it out just give it a nice subtle
brow bone highlight this pencil might
not be for someone that's like darker
and complexion even on me it's like
pretty pretty white I mean blends out
like a dream the blends out Bom I
love benefit stuff honestly this is so
much easier than doing it like when we
did the next one I hadn't tried it like
any other stuff and it was just a mess
okay once we stopped sweating oh my god
I turn on my fan and literally like have
a moment of like silence in the fan
blowing in my face because my is I'm a
sweaty monster right now I don't know
what the fuck's wrong with me um okay so
we're gonna go ahead and do primary for
the lid this is a stay don't stray
primer for the lid little twisty little
doe foot it's a little cute laying just
a little bit I'm very all about a very
tiny amount of primer for the lid and
just blending it out because if you use
too much primer it just does the
complete opposite effect
and just toss that into our crease it's
so easy to blend great crease color now
we just have a nice little bit of
definition in the outer corner do this
evening on other side this is like the
most natural I think I've ever been on
my channel the science nice sound like
been feeling me and now for the part
that I make the most excited for because
I feel like this is what really makes it
look more on the natural side for me at
least
this is the new benefit roller lash
mascara I absolutely love this freakin
mascara the way that they tell you to
use this on the box itself you want to
use the side that has like hard that's
like indented and like hook it on the
base of your lashes and kind of wiggle
up and that's how you're supposed to use
so let's go ahead just do that and hello
transfer hmm so that's a mascara with it
just a nice one little layer I think
that it really does an amazing amazing
amazing amazing job of giving me more
length and more fullness and that's
going to imply some on the bottom as
well the is gone for the bottom huh
too much cuz that's a look with some
mascara only I had open my window and
I'm trying a little bit more of a
background noise now but man I was
sweating more than a drag queen on a red
carpet like I was oh
patting my face okay okay cool so this
is what it looks like with some mascara
on I love love the mascara I think it's
friggin sickening and you guys know I
wear false lashes like all the time my
lashes are really like they like to
point straight down so I really have to
curl them like crazy just to get any
kind of curl yeah I think that they
turned out pretty good for just the
mascara like this is good for me it's
real good for me
I think honestly this mascara is better
than their their real mascara I think
it's so so good
I love it I love it hmmmm just do
lips won't be done so we're gonna do is
we're gonna grab the the benebalm in the
shade okay I literally have no idea what
close this is um it's
the red one please how's that on our
lips oh it smells like roses it's
literally just a lip balm with some
color I just feel so like a little like
a little schoolgirl who doesn't wear
makeup you don't like super cute like oh
I don't wear makeup and yes that was it
