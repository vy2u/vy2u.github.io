so today's video is going to be an
exciting video for me and for you guys
I'm hoping that some exciting for you
guys okay isn't be another installment
of my one brand tutorials and Shay's
video is going to be Kat Von D cosmetics
because you guys chose Kat Von D in my
last video I asked if you guys wanted to
see Mac or Kat Von D for the next one
right tutorial after I did NYX and
benefit so have you haven't seen those
videos yet I'll leave a link down below
as well I'm doing a series on my channel
where I'm doing one brand tutorials I'm
doing an entire look on just that one
brand and I think it's been going really
well so far and I love it and I think
this look came out really really nicely
and it's all Kat Von D and Kewanee is
one of my favorite brands like that is
sold at Sephora I think it's so awesome
I think it's really cost-efficient it's
not super super super expensive but it's
also a really high quality but yeah this
is what I came up with this is like a
outer smokey eye with a nice bold coral
pink lip and I think came out really
really nice it's a great look for spring
or summer if you wanted to be like a
little bit more on the bold side but
still want it to be like still like
glowy and springy thumri you know I'm
saying
yeah you guys know it's kind of video do
not watch it but yeah other than
that I'll get you guys to the tutorial
and I will catch you in my next video
that's an outro no I'll see you guys
soon bye
okay so we're gonna start on how do you
see all that yeah I don't know what that
is where's our other clean face
I already washed it and I moisturize so
we're good to go so it's going to start
yeah I'm gonna start with the Kat Von D
locket
by the way primer this is a water-based
primer it is extremely like liquidy I'd
used to once before and it wasn't like
anything amazing I wasn't like super
shocked and amazed by it but it does
feel super nice on the skin now we're
gonna go and take the Kat Von D lock-it
foundation and the shade 48 light I
think this is my color she is literally
shellac it is full coverage oh
my god it's really intense so I'm just
in take a little bit on my finger I'm
just going to Pat it I'm going to be
using a Beauty Blender with this because
this is a very full coverage mattifying
foundation and I want to sheer it out
very slightly I don't want to look like
shellac on my face
I don't want to look too cakey and I
think using a Beauty Blender with this
foundation specifically really really
really makes a huge huge difference huge
difference please a Beautyblender
because it does dilute it slightly not
too much but like very slightly dilute
it it is full coverage this does not
come off your face like if you were to
put this bitch on it is not coming off
your face this is an amazing foundation
for like an event or if you're going out
like to the club and you get oily oh my
god this bitch is not coming off even if
you're like dancing you're booty
popping and like grinding on some hoes
like this is not leaving literally
take a little bit ears down your neck a
little bit I don't have any powder here
so you can take this should done with it
so now I'm going take the lock a touch
of concealer and light 16 which I think
it's our lightest color so I'm just take
a very tiny amount and I'm going to Pat
it where I have the most amount of
darkness and bring it out and then right
away I'm gonna go in with a Beauty
Blender this is a full coverage
concealer so you really really really
want to go in quick to blend it out and
to set it because it will crease if you
do not set it I'm taking a little bit on
the lids tube to prime for the shadows
or going in with I'm just going to set
it right away quickly and I'm gonna take
the Kat Von D shade light with my
favorite powder contouring a highlight
of all time I'm taking the light banana
shade on a morphine and for 3/8 you guys
know this brush is my obsession I'm
going to set the under-eye with it right
away I like to just set it right away
I'm not going to do the other eye with
concealer first I'm setting this bitch
first and my eye light as well and then
we'll go in with I can see it on the
other side conceal conceal don't feel I
just realized I lost and eat my earring
holy okay problem partially solved
other we're concealed we're gonna go
back in with a more thick g7 and the
shade light palette we're gonna take
that middle yellow middle chain you're
doing these up to bronze up the face I
love this middle shade color because
it's beautiful warm terracotta color
like this foundation
dries to a matte finish so you don't
need to worry about like setting it you
really don't
it's pretty sick that warmth our cotta
color and just blend it into the skin
it's so beautiful - same thing on the
cheeks
I might have went a little heavy-handed
as you can see the palette is very
pigmented and I am absolutely obsessed
yeah it's bronzer I'm gonna take a
lighter shade I'm gonna put it in the
center of the forehead just to bring a
little bit of lightness to the face in
the center now I'm gonna go take my
makeup geek rounded blush brush and the
hmm
this shade right here is my favorite
contouring brush I'm going to take that
at the base of my ear to talk about your
down you start bluffing bluffing that in
and just really start buffing that into
the skin it's a little more cool tone
than the terracotta color that we went
over first so yeah so yeah look down the
temples as well just to give you a
little bit more of a dainty forehead
which it looks with me like this pretty
easy huh
so now I have the base down I'm gonna go
and do the eyes right now I'm actually
gonna do my brows off camera because I
don't think a blondie has brow products
yet so I'm gonna quickly do my brows off
camera and then I'll go into the eyes it
is time for the eye so I'm gonna go
ahead and take the monarch eyeshadow
palette the orange one I kept on D
obviously case is the key to the room
you know this is just like my obsession
of her palettes like this is one of my
all-time favorite ones I think it's so
beautiful and so universal I do think a
little welcoming so I go ahead and we're
gonna do a look with that so we're gonna
go and just take the bone shadow or take
that all over the brow bone area as well
as the lid is just going to kind of help
highlight the brow bone as well as give
us a kind of like a nice little base to
start with you know and then I'm just
doing that on a little more feet M 209
so I take a morphine 43 and I'm gonna
take that nice bright ask operate orange
color just a very small amount because
these shadows are so good I love them
and I'm just gonna run in the crease
very lightly because the is
orange and I really want to keep it
focused on the outer corner let her run
I left on the brush running it lightly
in the crease take down all the way and
I'm gonna go ahead take a sigma e40 and
blend that out even more oh and they
blend so nicely too hi hands I won today
yeah this looks pretty easy I'm
going to get a nice chocolate brown
shade on the same at 4-3-3 and I'm going
to run that on the outer corner lower
than I have that orange shade I'm not
just going to go into our clash line
almost as well in our crease I'm just
making a kind of like an outer
you with this you don't even be too neat
I kind of want it to be a little bit
smoky and messy I'm just going to take
that m4 33 and just go over the brown
and the orange again with no additional
product I'm just literally blending the
two together you forty sigma blend I
don't again so now I'm going to go and
take a sigma e30 pencil brush and that
black shade the slightest amount of it
because it is so pigmented like bitch -
a discriminative hug and I'm just going
to roughly run it into the brown as well
making a cute little V and then take a
clean brush any clean brush will work
I'm taking morphe up for 41 and blend
all that together I want the eye to be
nice and neutral but still with a little
pop of orange and warmth to it and
should look something like this
I'm very neutral kind of like outer
smokey eye going on grab any kind of
packing brush I'll take this one by
Sophie and then I'm going to grab that
same bone banana you shade and I'm gonna
take the on the lid the MOE bottle in
it's just gonna help contour the eye
slightly and just bring some light back
into it like me so now I'm gonna go into
a wing we're going to take the trooper
Kat Von D tattoo liner one of my
favorite liners like ever it's so good
it's so sharp you can do the most
amazing wing with these and I just love
it
boom Wang down yeah so now we're going
to go and dip back into that palette for
the bottom of the lash line take a
little bit of that orange shade very
little and mix it in with a chocolate
brown we're going to run that underneath
the lash line close to the lash line we
don't want it to be too and too intense
but I do want a little bit of definition
down here and slightly feather it
forward very slightly but I want the
most the most definitions beyond the
outer corner and then blend that out the
little morphe pencil brush very slightly
so now I'm gonna go into the other eye
off-camera as well as chrome eyelashes
and I shall be but right but okay good I
brought my room down to several degrees
while I'll do my other eyes so thank
goodness azuma eyes look like it's like
an outer smokey eye or ng warmth you
know my okay I'm gonna go into
place of mascara now we're gonna take
the immortal lash by Kat Von D I've
actually never tried this mascara before
so it's tearing up everything else I've
tried but not doing this the one is
 crazy is huge and notice
right away is that it makes my lashes
really skinny but it makes them really
dark too so that's good
something me that important to me
because I apply false lashes anyways I
just wish that I made my lashes a lot
thicker like they're like benefit roller
lash like I really love that mascara but
this one coat the bottom lashes tuned
carefully this bitch is so big like if
you're into like those huge ass ones
you're gonna be obsessed like you're
gonna love this bitch but I like smaller
ones for me because I'm just not careful
with the under eye like I'm just not
there we go
mascara is on I'm sweating again so I'm
gonna go take blinking Pugh lashes and
style number one you guys know style
number one blinking me lashes they just
make me so weak they just make me so
weak like they're just so beyond amazing
I'm not even kidding oh my god I'm like
I've worn these lashes like literally
still give up on me a bitch do not give
up on me yet I'm not ready perfect the
lashes are on and the eyes are done so
let me go into me guys in to see what
the eyes look like up close she got me
like let's finish off the face okay so I
do not have any blush when Kat Von D I
know they have blushes I just forgot to
go out and get one so we're gonna go
ahead and take this satin peachy pink
gold color on a morphe g5o we're gonna
use as blush loaded carefully because
they're shadows next to it okay no we're
not gonna use that brush we're going to
use a morphine 509 which is like a
tapered blush brush essentially and I'm
gonna load that brush up it's so pretty
it's like a pretty golden pink and why
not use shadow as a blush why
not who said again it's like I'm using
his blush and highlight because it does
like a machine I may or may not have
gotten some of the gray on my face
that's what you get when you are trying
to be resourceful and use a shadow as
blush but whatever it's not even that
noticeable so that's a lot
we're almost done you guys we only have
lips left so I decided because our eye
is kind of silky but it's so more on the
natural smoky side like it's not like
friggin black everywhere you know so I'm
gonna go ahead and take the Jeffrey
liquid lipstick it's just beautiful
hot-ass pink coral ooh I hate what we're
drawing with just a doe foot applicator
and not having like a lip liner but I'll
think have one dee has a Twitter that
does a bit dry on my lips I thought this
color is so perfect for summer and
spring it's like the most beautiful hot
coral pink oh yeah this is the whole
look what do you think hopefully you
guys like this look I think it's so easy
to do using that one palette lipstick
you're good to go and the contouring
highlighting obviously is it's easy to
do I promise you it's really easy to do
as long as you're following along and
things like that
