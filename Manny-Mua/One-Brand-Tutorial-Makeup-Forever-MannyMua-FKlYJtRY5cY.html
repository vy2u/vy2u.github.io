tutorials series I have going on my
youtube I have like three from up right
now I'm sorry that took me so long to
get this one up I've just been doing so
many other things and I just been
wanting to film other videos so finally
had some time to sit down and film a
makeup for everyone I had you guys vote
in my Kat Von D one what you guys wanted
to see next whether it be Matt Hart or
make it forever and make it forever one
not by a lot it was like all over the
place honestly everyone wanted
everything every wanted to see Tarte Mac
and makeup Evers make if ever took it by
like a very tiny amount my whole entire
faces make a forever besides the brows
the browser how to use like a random
brow gel because I couldn't find
anything for make if ever for the brows
and I didn't want to use the aqua steal
I want to go all fleek --is-- with the
brow you know everything other than the
browser's may go forever
I am so excited to be doing this series
I'm going to be doing more room I
promise you guys I will be doing more I
just got sidetracked but this is not a
done series this is gonna keep going as
long as I can do it
maybe hoe just recycle too right yeah I
hope you guys like this look if you guys
like this video if you guys don't like
me please don't watch it you know
that J like that but if you guys do like
this video and you guys do it like me
please like this video like the little
bitches like write down there's a little
like one right here in the little thumb
click it and comment if you guys like it
as well I would really appreciate that
yeah without further ado let's go ahead
and get started on this one brand look
on makeup ever hey guys okay cool so
let's go and start this bad boy off I'm
so if I've had to be filming this video
I should feel this so long ago but you
know what better like the Nevers when I
always thing okay so let's go and start
with the face of course my face is
completely bare Elia moisturizer on and
I'm gonna go ahead and start with primer
so for today I'm gonna be using the step
1 equalizers I think they are such
amazing primers for the face I think
they're freakishly bomb I'm gonna take
the step 1 equalizer in smoothing and
that's going to go in my t-zone this is
such a great smoothing primer it hides
the appearance of pores like stupid bomb
I'm just on my nose and just go with one
finger and like press it around and you
want my pores that are big-ass
impulsive death that's we want to put it
ok and then I'm going to take the
hydrating one for the perimeter of my
face I feel like it helps my face like
look less cracking less cakey so I had
to put this on spot so I have like more
fine lines or wrinkles like this area
right here cuz I smile too damn much the
equalizers from makeup forever are meant
to be used together with fellow
equalizers so it's totally fine if you
mix them together because it's going to
totally work out in your favor trust a
bitch cuz mama knows ok cool he's over
foundation I'm gonna be taking you make
if ever ultra
HD foundation is a new one they just
launched and I'm gonna shade 140 equals
why 305 makeup ever numbering is not my
favorite because I think it's really
confusing I'm gonna take two pumps on
the back of my hand a lofty pumpa let's
make it two and a half okay I'm gonna
take a Beauty Blender I was gonna press
out all over the skin I can start on my
cheeks because that's where I have like
the most coarse again and I like to fill
up my pores with some foundation is a
good for your skin probably not probably
 not I think the coverage is
better than the old one I think this one
also lasts longer on the face and the
old HD still make a forever you're done
did good my camera wasn't freaking
filming but what I did was I did an
excessive step you don't need to this
whatsoever but I took the Makeup Forever
HD stick it's more of a full coverage
foundation stick and I put this on my
cheeks this is gonna give you more
coverage this is a full coverage stick
that gives you like really glowy like
satin finish I'm just gonna put in the
t-zone to kind of highlight the face a
little bit
and then blend it out with a Beauty
Blender you feel me it blends out like
so freakishly balm is stupid
again that step was not necessary but
you know my how to do it because Mama's
extra mom with extra now I'm gonna take
some concealer I'm gonna take the full
cover cream and shade number three this
is like the only concealer half of me
confirms though this what I'm gonna use
and I'm gonna use that with a Beauty
Blender because this bitch is folk over
to the bug I'm gonna press that and
underneath the eye it's so pretty though
oh my gosh
I'm gonna highlight with this too but
use it very sparingly you don't need so
much of it so don't like use a lot of it
if you don't need a lot of it take my
Beauty Blender and blend out so you can
also pick up the excess product because
it is a full coverage concealer and it's
a cream so you definitely know work
quick with it and you want to set it all
so quickly I'm gonna take this eyeshadow
if I make it forever it's this one right
here I don't really know the name of it
I mean it on the back but it's kind of
bitch to find so I'm just gonna leave it
and the shipping box down below it's an
eyeshadow but it's kind of like a
yellowy base so I'm gonna use that to
set my under I'm you might as well you
know with the powder the powder
you feel the eyeshadows are so really
good see nice I see no rules to it you
know I'm saying tour see the little
thing looked make it firmer look what
they did for me
they sent me that super cool PR think
manatees were sold separately like you
guys could buy these little things like
your favorite influencers faces on them
that'd be so freaking cool I don't know
I think that's such a cool thing and I
think it's so cool that makeup ever sent
these out to people I'm so honored to
have spin sentiment I think make if ever
is amazing you're forever if you want to
have a collab great so we are now
concealed and we have foundation on and
we are good to go now I want to go and
set my face I'm gonna take the Make Up
For Ever HD High Definition powder
is the loose one I wish I have the first
one but I don't but I'm gonna take a
little bit on the back of the cap and
take that with a more Fiji zero my holy
grail powder brush just it's so good the
colors you see pricing bubble bubble
toil and trouble you don't want to put
too much on because it's going to give
you like that white flash back because
it is a silica powder so you have to be
really cautious of that but just go
ahead and start pressing over the face
with the HD powder I think that HD
powder looks so pretty I'm going to take
the makeup arrow finishing powder and
1:18 and I'm gonna take that on my neck
just to kind of match my neck a little
bit better to my face this powder is
just like a foundation powder and it's
actually really really nice I use it on
my face sometimes too I was gonna run
that on my neck just down my neck a
little bit on my ears and yeah so that's
all I got
okay cool so now I'm gonna bronze up the
thing I'm gonna taking make it forever
matte bronze powder and shade 20 I
talked about this before my channel
before I think it's such an amazing
amazing amazing bronzer and take that in
a more few - I'm just gonna run that in
my bronze in the area it's not too warm
not too cool I think it's so beautiful
and I like that it's very buildable this
is such a buildable bronzer it's not
like so heavy or anything like that
interesting so nice a little bit on my
chin a little bit down my chin
huh what is this oh my chin yeah Majin
jaw uh otherwise jaw hmm ohh oh
my god cool so we have some bronzer
Annika laughs a nice dimension to the
skin I feel like the bronzer looks so
freakin pretty I just in the bronze look
so gorge
so not for blush I'm gonna take the
sculpting blush in the shade 10 it's
like a very nice pastel a pink color I'm
just gonna dust a little bit about on
like not a lot so like blush sleeping
its up really pretty like fleshy kind of
pink it's like so like mmm you know I
don't know what that noise was but
that's what I'm feeling perfect we are
blushed I feel like what am i selling
makeup on I start getting more like
diva-ish you know like a lot people like
notice in my videos like I'll be like in
boy mode I'm like super like hey guys
Todd like that is not like super chill
and as soon as I start getting like this
foundation on as soon as I hit the
highlighter on I'm like sup bitch hey
girl
what kind of thing you know so now for
blind later I'm gonna be taking the pro
sculpting duo in the shade number two
which um hi obsession I don't take that
on a morpheme 5/10 brush just to
highlight the skin I'm taking that gold
color to highlight go I'm just gonna go
in I love this highlighter so much Jo
how good it is joke why don't I use this
more I forgot I don't use this enough
okay great perfect so the face is
basically done this is what it looks
like the face is complete let's go and
start getting into the eyes now okay
so basically I saw and I did a look I
did like almost the whole entire eye
look already but I hated it so much like
my liner looks so shitty that I
took it all off and reapply concealer
and everything so if you guys see like
any kind of like cracking in my
concealer it's cuz I wiped off like this
whole area already and I just reapply it
so hopefully doesn't look too bad but
I'm doing this again that look was
shitty happens to me too all the time
okay so whatever I do now for the eye
look already primed my eyes and I
already did my brows off-camera using
the concealer and I used that shadow
that one shadow and I pressed it over it
as well as the brows the brows I didn't
have anything from make it forever to
use for the brows so just like you know
what we just do am off camera because I
didn't have anything from them I wanted
like a little bit of brow gel but they
have the Aqua seal and I didn't really
want to use the Aqua seelix I don't want
to go to flee so what I'm gonna do now
is I'm gonna take the e27 my morphe and
I'm running in my bronzer and I'm gonna
be using that as my transition shade now
I wanna see like how I feel about
bronzers I just feel like they're
big-ass eyeshadows you can use bronzer
as much as you want honestly as a shadow
there's nothing wrong with that
whatsoever I'm gonna run that into my
crease and your eye should look
something like this is a nice just
diffused crease I like that a lot
so neo I'm gonna go and take this
beautiful cranberry shade right here
cherry Morello by making everything
everything that honest morphe and 4-3-3
a very small amount of it I don't wanna
go to ham with this color because it can
look real pink real quick okay I
honestly love this color so much so it's
like stupid how much I love it
beautiful as soon as I saw it I was like
I need to use that just feather it
forward towards the front of the eye I'm
just being very light handed with the
I'm not taking too much most of it is
deposited on the outer corner I just
think this shade is so friggin beautiful
it's stupid so I'll take that
8:27 again and just blend out that color
I'm gonna be going in with this gorgeous
palette from makeup forever it's like
the number one palette and I'm gonna
take that middle shade it's like a
really beautiful like taupe color I'm
sure teeth on my finger I'm gonna place
that on my lid it's so stir me
and then I grabbed the darker one right
here with my finger again and just put
down the outer corner like just very
slightly a lot just for some dimension
on the lid still just some more
dimension and then with that same import
three three I'm just gonna blend out the
edges a little bit more and then with
that same palette I would take a little
bit of the black on the m4 33 and then
just place that on the outer corner only
just for some more dimension again I
want this look to be nice and blended
very well you just have a little bit of
that pink like cranberry shades shining
through not too much but I like it and
then taking that you 27 again and
blending out the edges taking that same
banana shade right here I'm gonna toss
something on the brow bone again just to
kind of clean up what I kind of messed
up and with like the blending and
whatnot highlight all over again you
know on a morphe m42 - letting it
downwards and the eye top of that i she
looks something like this
i really like this one turned out much
better than the last one damn
okay great so now the tops of the eyes
are done I think they came out way
better than the other I did like oh my
gosh you guys should have saw if you
guys follow me on snapchat you guys saw
it I bet you guys are like duh look it
was Nucky whatsoever so let me just go
and finish the bottom of the high now
I'm gonna take that same matte bronzer I
make a favorite and the e36 pencil brush
buy more feet I'm just gonna run that
underneath the eye you don't need to be
too neat with it is just gonna be our
transition I'll see we're not gonna do
very much to the bottom lashline because
I wanted to be just focus on the top of
the Highmore I'm gonna go back in with
the artist palette I'm gonna take this
shade down here it's one that we put on
the outer corner all right I'm gonna
place that on the outer corner of my
lower lash line with that same a36 I
don't like I'll give you that intense
like dimension but it has like a really
cool Sheen to it as well and then just
kind of feather that forward it's a nice
really pretty coppery brown shading now
with the Saint you 36 brush just kind of
dust
the bitch off on a little rug or
something on your pants whatever I'm
taking this icy shade right here end up
with that on the inner corner of my eye
as my inner corner highlight kids that's
like a pinky tone to it
Oh what the and you know that
that's cool okay great so I have curled
my lashes already off-camera just
because it's curling your lashes you
know how to do that so I'm gonna go and
take the smoky extravagant and I'm gonna
just put some of that on my lashes I've
never actually tried this mascara before
well let's let's hope for the best okay
my mom loves it she looks she's obsessed
this brush is so weirdos a little
teardrop
yeah like it I guess mascara it's pretty
nice and don't forget the bottom lashes
too of course I want to put myself I
always plug myself I get
crazy and excited about like putting my
lashes on like mascara so I like put
myself all the time mm-hmm
different I like it I like it okay but
honestly I'm like really like any
smoking shopping in mascara like how
come I've never used this before I think
it's so nice like what the hell so never
lashes I'm for somethin for lashes on
because I always wear lashes I'm gonna
take my favorite lashes of like the
moment and my moment I mean last three
months the new bound some lashes Bella
minks they are the most beautiful like
flurry intense lashes they are more on
the dramatic side so you have to be like
cautious of that any event like that I
go to for anything or just like
tutorials here and there they aren't the
lashes I'm wearing and that's what one
of them looks like look at that
difference oh my gosh I love this lash
so much let's go on to toss the other
bitch on a change right ya know half the
time I won't even wear eyeliner what
these lashes because it's such a nice
black dark band I feel like it gives me
definition already and I don't even need
to wear eyeliner at all yes the lashes
are on and they're flaky am I going to
be getting to see what they look like
awesome so the eyes are done what you
guys think so now on the lips I'm almost
done with the look I'm gonna do the lips
now I'm gonna be taking the lipliner in
to see which is like one of my favorite
lip liners to them I think they're the
planners are beautiful and they last
forever on the lip they're so creamy I
love them to have these bitches glide on
like butter I'm not kidding guys
the makeup ever lip liners are one of
the nicest lip liners I've ever felt
like on the lip they literally feel like
butter fill the whole damn lip in and
then for the lipstick I decided I'm
gonna go in with a new today because you
know the last look I did I had more of a
bold lip and I want to go with more of a
new delete this time I'm gonna take the
Rouge artist intense number 22 it's a
very very light lip look
I mean nude but it's a very light nude
like very light so I'm just gonna put
that all over the lips that's it's
like paste
dude this lip is killing me right now
I've never even tried that combo and I
just thought they look good and it does
and that's it that's it for the whole
entire look I hope you guys enjoyed this
video I had such an amazing time doing
this there was a part where I was like
getting too freaked out because I was
like oh my god not to wipe off all my
makeup because this is turning out like

honestly like it was looking really bad
in the beginning because I'd like I went
too thick on my liner on one side so I
try to make it thick on the other side
