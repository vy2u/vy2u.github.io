so today's video is going to be a one
brand makeup tutorial when I do the
whole face this one's gonna be NYX
Cosmetics I'm thinking about doing a new
series on my channel where I'm doing
full on full blown full face tutorials
with just one brand and I think this is
the first one I'm starting with his NYX
I was very very very very very hesitant
to create this video
I do love a lot of next things but I do
not love a lot of next things as well
and this is the first time I'm trying a
lot of things on myself
in the tutorial and I'm not the type of
person like I'm sure you have noticed
I'm not the type of person to talk shit
about a brand or a shop talk shit about
a product on my channel a lot of people
do that and it's great for a lot of
people they like doing that but it's not
my style
I don't like talking shit about other
brands and like about other products I
like talking great about products and
then just not mentioning products I
don't like you know I mean so the fact
that I haven't tried to love the next
stuff I use in this video makes me
nervous because it's like okay well you
guys are gonna see if I like it or not
it's gonna be right then and obvious so
I hope you guys don't mind that or if
you guys can see like I don't like a
product or not but I don't need to talk
shit about any brand
yeah if you guys want to see that that
kind of thing going sorry those long
intro but I just patched how to say that
because I'm just I'm not used to this
kind of video so let me know what you
guys thought if you guys like this kind
of video cuz then of course I'll
continue to do it but I'm just like hell
if I want to do this because I don't
want to talk shit but sometimes people
need constructive criticism you know
what I'm saying if you guys don't like
the video don't fucking watch it mm-hmm
don't if you don't like that shit yeah
okay guys tutorial and yeah right
okay cool so let's go and get the show
on the road we're gonna do the full face
today I'm super nervous to be filming
this because I don't like I don't do
this kind of thing like I don't talk
about products I've never tried before
on camera oh we're gonna do is we're
gonna go and start with the NYX angel
veil skin perfecting primer this one
this one is one of the ones I have tried
and why did I just put that much
honestly I really do like this primary
like I think it's really pretty I think
with me a really nice base it feels next
to the skin does it feel to silicone but
it definitely feels like has a slip to
it so I think family shouldn't go on to
it really nicely I'm not just say about
it but it's a pretty good product I like
that primer I'm next I'm going with the
next studio photogenic
nation in shade 102 soft beige comers
you get Dolf of it on the back of my
hand foundation is very very very
liquidy it like has so much like slip to
it and honestly like I tried this on a
Shinto so far I have really weird mixed
feelings about this foundation because I
think that it doesn't give enough
coverage so you have to use a lot of
product it leaves you like a satin
finish and I'm not into satin finishes
for my foundation I like to make my
foundation like that and then I make it
more glowy in certain areas that I want
to be good so now I'm going to go ahead
and take my morphe 439 and I'm just
gonna really press the foundation into
the skin I was gonna use a Beauty
Blender with this but the Beauty Blender
really dilutes it even more with this
one I really want to just press the
foundation in because I want to keep the
medium coverage this is like a medium
coverage foundation and I really want at
least at least keep the medium coverage
like I want more but I'm glad my nose is
like rejecting this foundation dude
like my nose is not having it so we have
one layer of foundation on I put a lot
of it on but I mean we have a layer down
what do you think next I'm gonna grab
the NYX HD concealer in the shade light
and now we're going to conceal our eyes
and stuff like that with the concealer I
tried this consider literally only one
time before we'll see how my opinion out
what I think about it right now down the
forehead as well this smells kind of
weird I'm gonna go end with I'm working
the same morphe brush and really just
press it in the concealer actually no
I'm gonna go ahead and take the M 439 my
morphe which is smaller kabuki brush and
buff out the concealer I like this
concealer I think it's a really pretty
concealer I do I really do it gives me a
nice medium to full coverage it doesn't
settle too terribly and it covers pretty
well with the concealer and makes it
look like I have much more full coverage
which I really like not too bad not too
bad computer I like yeah you're winning
me over
it's going put a little bit on the
eyelids as well just a prime for
eyeshadows later not using concealer as
primer so a very light layer of it cuz
you don't want to decrease its go to the
opposite effect if you put way too much
so we're gonna put a very light amount
of concealer on the lid I look like a
fucking go
so now we're going to go ahead and take
the next highlight and contour pro
palette I haven't tried this one yet so
I guess we'll see what I think we're
right now and we're going to use the
banana shade for the under-eye
highlighting let's go ahead and load up
my morphe m4 38 brush so when I dip into
the product I notice that it's really
powdery so a lot of product I don't you
guys can actually tell but around the
around the pan there's a lot of excess
product that lifts up which is kind of
annoying but I can deal with it so we're
gonna go ahead and set the under bag
with this and then go ahead say your
eyelids as well oh I don't know
highlight I don't know if I like to tell
it honestly so far oh I'm not feeling it
it's too powdery I'm let's try the
bronzer so let's go ahead and just take
if like any kind of brush like this I
got a paddle brush we're gonna go ahead
and dip into this color right here okay
so this is how I feel the pigment is
great because there's like there's a lot
of pigment that comes up but it's so
ridiculously it's so ridiculously
powdery it just it's such a mess okay
let's go ahead and bronze like look I
feel like that's patchy like do not see
like there's like patchiness here I'm
just going back in with my foundation
brush and just kind of carving out the
bottom of it to come help with the
patchiness much better it's a little bit
more diffuse now at least but you know
why we're gonna use everything that we
can because this is a full next tutorial
we're gonna do another thing I don't
like about this palette is that every
single color here it gives a satin
finish none of them are like truly matte
which I don't like I want it I want it
to give me more of a matte finish
especially when I'm going in with more
bronzy colors for my contour we're to go
ahead and grab this color all the way
over here and that's gonna be hard like
I like tone color thing I really pretty
shame when you look at it in here it
looks much more warm than this one this
one looks really pale and super like
silver this one new things and you look
at more warmer but this one like looks
silver on me I'm fine work with it or
with that and now we're gonna go in with
Towe blush by next I hear about this
blush all the freaking time that's like
super amazing so balm and it gives you
like a really nice pretty contour so I
wouldn't try it right now
I haven't try to get so we'll see I'm
gonna use the rounded blush brush might
make a geek like my normal contour brush
I use I'm just going to contour with it
it definitely is much more of a cool
tone bronzy look I'm not used to really
doing cool tone contours which is so
finding kids like so controversial like
I always do like really warm contour
that's a style I like to do but um you
know I think this is cute I like I like
this is it taupe is cute I can see why
people like it for sure okay sort of
contoured and we're bronze we're going
to go in with NYX amber blush with in
morphe g-eight that we're just going to
put into our blush area toss it on I'm
sure it's pretty Oh super pigmented why
do I do this to myself okay you know
what if we have a lot of blush on it's
fine we're gonna scale back on that
foundation brush I really just press
over it a plus pigmentation NYX
Cosmetics from the blushes holy titty
it's like my face is coming together now
it's looking better looking better for
sure
okay so we're done with the face
basically I think we're good to go
please are actually gonna go into our
brows first we do our eyes I'm gonna go
in with the NYX eyebrow gel waterproof
eye brow gel in espresso an EO six brush
money NYSEG monthly I tried the brow
gels already um I don't really honestly
my opinion on the brow gel they're very
intense it's hard to get a small amount
and like not look like drag queen ish
but um I think that the colors really
nice something they go on really
smoothly but I wish that they lasted
longer on the brows because they don't
last as long as I wanted them to it I
see when they see like a waterproof like
I don't think they're waterproof like
they definitely won't come off so do
your brows how you do not normally okay
Jenna get closer
and then I'm gonna go in with the NYX
eye tinted brow mascara and the color
black it's not really black it's like
brown take a deep brown I haven't read
this one yet so we'll see how this goes
please be okay what is it there please
be a good product good today hmm
no sweetheart uh-uh so not gonna work
for me okay so the reason I don't like
it is because it's kind of gunky and the
way it applies it doesn't apply evenly
on the brow so like when you're like if
you have a spot on your brow that guys
like a lot of hair and you're gonna bow
to go over it it like will skit and
it'll apply like a lot towards like
where I have more hair so and then it
also like kinda removes parts where I
didn't want to be removed and just it
feels like wax honestly just feel like
wax it doesn't feel like how a brow gel
should feel and I have Donna saucy brow
gels and those ones are bomb but this
one don't sorry I'm gonna like you're
really good but I don't after trial and
Carvin this is what the brows end up
looking like I'm trying to get away from
doing like a more fleek brow I'm trying
to more of like the natural brow but
products I had did not allow me to do
natural I had to go flake the parties
made me go fleek I had no joy Lana doing
okay now we're doing the eyes we're
gonna go ahead and go back in with this
palette I know I don't like you very
much but we're gonna be strong we're
gonna use it so I'm using my size shadow
so our window is gonna go out this color
right here which is just a basically um
cream color and that we're going to toss
in to make sure everything kind of
blends into everything a lot easier on a
sigma e40 the highlighting contour
shades like they're very pigmented but
they're so pottery it just it drives me
insane I couldn't use them just based on
the factor then I'm gonna go in with a
morphine 43 which is like my favorite
morphe brushes and then we're going to
go ahead and go in with this shade right
here the one that used to bronze with
and that we're going to toss them to the
crease and we're shouldn't kind of carve
out the the crease with it it was like
that it looks pretty nice I'm really
impressed with that as a shadow
stop patchy a shadow but it's patchy on
the face that's like annoying then we're
going with ie 40 M just kind of blend
I'm a firm believer and even if you have
like the shittiest shadows or the
shittiest
product if you have a good brush
everything will turn out okay
and then going in with a contain a
little flat brush and going in with that
same cream color we used I'm just kind
of highlighting the brow bone with it
the nice pretty bone white color now
we're actually gonna go in with an
eyeshadow called
the chaser fashion fascination I don't
know what this is I have no idea what
it's called not a single clue but that
we're gonna go in we're gonna toss that
into the outer corner just for some
extra dimension it's a little bit more
of a cool tone brown so I'm gonna use
that more of like a contour Brown whew
like that gun really liking it I like
that color at all I'm really impressed
with how these blend on the eye I'm not
gonna lie I rhymed they're not hard to
blend out one eye on the face it's
another story a whole nother story on
the face but I pretty good it's all
about those tools that we're using now
we're gonna go in with the Girl Talk I
shadow the Girl Talk is actually part of
the new prismatic shadows that are
launching honestly the prismatic shadows
are freaking bomb dude like I'm so
impressed by these prismatic shadows
we're just gonna press it on to our lid
nah fuck that we're gonna use our finger
press on to the lid look at that that's
nice right up to a crease and I'm just
gonna kind of go in with that 4-3-3 in
just kind of blend out the edges let's
go ahead do something fun so we're gonna
go ahead and grab mixes to do liquid
liner in extreme blue which is like this
and that we're going to use as our
eyeliner
oh my god
I'm gonna lose my shit my battle is my
shit we're just gonna go ahead and go
underneath it and just kind of clean it
up with concealer problem number one
with this is that you can see right here
is because it's so liquidy that ended up
going into like a wrinkle of my high and
now it transferred upwards but for now
let's just focus on the liner let me get
straight as possible everything would
have been so perfect it just did not
transfer what we're gonna do is we're
gonna go in with concealer lock it that
way we're gonna let that dry we're gonna
let the concealer dry and then we're
going to go over it with some shadow
later go now that we're dealing with the
madness let's just let it dry it's gonna
be fine
it's gonna be fucking fun we're going
with the NYX Trey Jolie eyeliner and
Brown and I think this liner is really
cute I feel like it's built pretty well
actually and like it has a little twist
top and a nice liner I think it's really
pretty
in our waterline please pay me Dan like
that mm-hmm
and I buff it out it's nice and warm
Brown like that you need to work quickly
with this this ting is drying fast now
we're going to go in with that same
bronzing color that we used and then
we're just gonna buff that over the
liner because I don't want it to be too
dark this one to be pretty warm and if
you can if everything's dry just go
ahead and go back to like on a buff in
the concealer okay cool so that's what
the eye looks like now we had a couple
hiccups but it's fine we dealt with it
we're strong bitches we can deal with
this shit okay the first eyelid I real
quick off-camera and I'll be your back
well so now we're gonna go ahead and
apply some mascara we're gonna use NYX
the skinny mascara which is a new
product for them it's like literally
like the tiniest thing I've ever seen
and I think it's kind of badass so let's
see how work um this mess here is
phenomenal at like separating lashes I
don't think it's really meant for the
top to be honest but I don't have any
other NYX mascara for the top so I'm
just gonna make it work make it work
what Tyra says bitch make it work so
perfect for the bottom I love it it's so
little
I'm never gonna put myself in the high
again cool so now I have mascara on the
top and the bottom it doesn't matter for
the top like I'm just doing it to make
them look a little bit more black
because we're gonna go in with falsies
anyway
so don't even trip we're gonna go in
with falsies I haven't used yet this is
a blinking view pair in number one what
this pair you guys I just I'm like can
you even wait what time I saw Scott
Barnes blowing on his lashes like hot
air so I started laying on my lashes
with hot air
yes his lashes are so good i jus wanna
slap my camera cuz they're so good what
the yeah Tess finally got the I look out
gone finally I got that eyelid down so
I'm going to be guys in for a final I
now that we're done with the eyes we're
going to move on to my favorite part
which is always the lips you guys know
I'm sure like my go-to thing I love
doing lipstick I love doing lipstick I'm
gonna throw it going with NYX peekaboo
neutral lip liner which I use this lip
liner all the time and the fact that
this is like an eggs all next tutorial
which you so have become like I can use
you okay so you line your lips whoever
you want to line them
this color is live and I use it so much
that I know I love it already so I'm
like I'm not worried about like not
liking a product you know we're just
going to go ahead and align like half
the lid and then we're gonna go ahead
and grab the NYX soft matte lip cream in
Ã½stanbul you didn't Ã½stanbul
I don't know what accent that was on a
bit insolent boy etc nah but I try it
it's an Istanbul oh my god they smell so
good yeah like cake batter or something
like that this is such a pretty color oh
my gosh they smell amazing they apply
amazing they're definitely not that
matte like a cream like a cream lipstick
formula I don't really see them as being
any kind of mattifying maybe I need to
let it dry out my lips I never tried
this before so see it's getting mad at
me in this town and I like it I like it
yeah and that was it for the final look
hopefully you guys liked it I think this
is really cool I think it's fun to kind
of test out a whole entire brand into a
full face could you be like resourceful
you have to use like bronzer as
eyeshadow or so many thought you have to
be resourceful and I think it's fun I
know I didn't really like everything
that I use but I think that the final
product came up pretty nicely I think
you can do this whole entire look for a
lot less money than looks I've done in
the past so I think that's really really
really really cool let me know if you
guys would like want this to be serious
- I can do this with a couple more
brands I think that would be so fun to
do like a series or like a playlist on
my channel where it's like one brand
tutorials like where it's like I'm using
one brand the entire Tottori I seen some
other people do it too and I think
that's so fun to watch because I'm like
